### Prime Minister’s Foreword

Terrorism continues to pose a serious security challenge to Australia.
The Australian Government remains resolute in its commitment to
protect Australia, its people and interests from this threat.

The Government is committed to concrete action to combat
terrorism. We will continue to ensure that agencies are
appropriately resourced, that responses are agile and can meet
changing threats, and that all necessary and practical action is
taken to protect Australia and Australians.

The policy outlined in this White Paper delivers an effective
and balanced approach that further strengthens our domestic
counter-terrorism efforts and makes a strong contribution
to international counter‑terrorism efforts.

The Government has made a number of important changes to the way Australia responds to terrorism.
This White Paper sets out our strengthened approach to aviation security, and improves the coordination of our
counter-terrorism efforts. It also sets out for the first time a strategy to counter violent extremism in Australia.

The Government has taken and will continue to take all necessary measures to combat terrorism and those
who plan or perpetrate such acts. This White Paper reiterates the Government’s commitment to provide the
necessary resources to Australia’s law enforcement, intelligence, security and border protection agencies to enable
them to operate effectively. At the same time, we have also taken steps to ensure that Australia’s response to
terrorism does not inadvertently undermine the principles that we seek to uphold.

No government can guarantee that Australians will be free from the threat of terrorist attack.

But this Government can guarantee that we will take all necessary and practical measures to combat the threat.

This White Paper forms part of the Government’s national security reform agenda. It is a further step in
delivering a safer, more secure Australia.

The Hon Kevin Rudd MP
Prime Minister of Australia

### Executive Summary

The first responsibility of government is the protection of Australia, Australians and Australian interests. So a key
government priority is to protect Australia from terrorism.

The threat of terrorism to Australia is real and enduring. It has become a persistent and permanent feature
of Australia’s security environment.

The main source of international terrorism and the primary terrorist threat to Australia and Australian interests
is from a global violent jihadist movement – extremists who follow a distorted and militant interpretation
of Islam that espouses violence as the answer to perceived grievances. This extremist movement comprises
al‑Qa’ida, groups allied or associated with it, and others inspired by a similar worldview.

While the threat is persistent, the challenge has evolved since the last counter-terrorism White Paper in 2004
in two respects.

First, while there have been counter-terrorism successes (most notably pressure on al‑Qa’ida’s core leadership
in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and action against terrorists in South-East Asia), these successes have been offset by
the rise of groups affiliated with, or inspired by, al‑Qa’ida’s message and methods, with new areas such as Somalia
and Yemen joining existing areas of concern in South Asia, South-East Asia, the Middle East and the Gulf.

A second shift apparent since 2004 has been the increase in the terrorist threat from people born or raised
in Australia, who have become influenced by the violent jihadist message. The bombings in London
on 7 July 2005, which were carried out by British nationals, brought into stark relief the real threat of
globally-inspired but locally generated attacks in Western democracies, including Australia.

A number of Australians are known to subscribe to this message, some of whom might be prepared to engage
in violence. Many of these individuals were born in Australia and they come from a wide range of ethnic
backgrounds. The pool of those committed to violent extremism in Australia is not static – over time some
move away from extremism while others become extreme.

We have seen terrorist planning within Australia. Since 2001, numerous terrorist attacks have been thwarted
in Australia. Thirty-eight people have been prosecuted or are being prosecuted as a result of counter-terrorism
operations and 20 people have been convicted of terrorism offences under the Criminal Code. Over
40 Australians have had their passports revoked or applications denied for reasons related to terrorism.

The Government’s counter-terrorism strategy is informed by a number of core judgements. We must take
a comprehensive and layered approach. Our counter-terrorism measures must be informed by strategic
judgements about the nature of the threat and Australia’s vulnerability to it. And we must conduct our activities
in a manner which harnesses our capabilities, upholds our principles and mitigates the risk of attack or
failure in our response.


-----

The strategy has four key elements:

1. **Analysis: an intelligence-led response to terrorism driven by a properly connected and properly informed**
national security community.

2. **Protection: taking all necessary and practical action to protect Australia and Australians from terrorism at**
home and abroad.

3. **Response: providing an immediate and targeted response to specific terrorist threats and terrorist attacks**
should they occur.

4. **Resilience: building a strong and resilient Australian community to resist the development of any form of**
violent extremism and terrorism on the home front.

Analysis

Australia’s counter-terrorism efforts are intelligence-led and focused on prevention. This approach hinges on
strong partnerships and cooperation at the national level, effective engagement at the international level,
and effective information sharing. Over recent years, there has been significant growth in Australia’s security,
intelligence and law enforcement agencies and the Government has taken steps to improve their capabilities
and enhance information sharing. The establishment of the National Intelligence Coordination Committee
has ensured that Australia’s intelligence effort, both domestically and internationally, is better integrated into
the new national security arrangements. The creation of a new Counter-Terrorism Control Centre will also
ensure that we better integrate our overall counter-terrorism intelligence capabilities.

Protection

The Government is committed to taking strong action to protect Australians and reduce the risk of attack.
This approach involves efforts at a number of complementary levels, including:

� strong border management arrangements to prevent the movement of individuals who try to enter

or transit Australia to conduct terrorism-related activities by introducing a new biometric-based visa
system for certain non-citizens – making it harder for terrorists to evade detection;

� preventing Australians suspected of involvement in terrorism from travelling overseas by revoking

or denying passports;

� improving the security of our airports to enhance protection of the travelling public;

� continued cooperation and collaboration with the states and territories through comprehensive national

counter-terrorism arrangements;

� working in partnership with the business community to protect our critical infrastructure, including

information and communications technology; and

� strengthened collaboration with international partners, both bilaterally and multilaterally, to contribute to

international counter-terrorism efforts and create an international environment that is hostile to terrorism.


-----

Response

The Government’s ability to prevent and disrupt terrorist attacks within Australia relies on coordinated and
cooperative relationships between our intelligence, security and law enforcement agencies nationally.
This collaborative approach ensures that we have a robust and effective national capacity to respond to terrorist
threats. Australia’s comprehensive national response uses the full array of Commonwealth, state and territory
counter-terrorism capabilities. It is underpinned by a legal regime that provides effective powers for our agencies
and the ability to prosecute people who seek to conduct terrorist acts. The Government will keep these powers
under review against any further need to expand them or tailor them to deal with any changes in the nature of
the threat in the future.

Resilience

Australia’s counter-terrorism efforts are supported by our open democratic society. There are inherent strengths
in our society that make Australia resilient to the divisive worldview of al-Qa’ida and like-minded groups.
However, we know from experience that the terrorist narrative may resonate with a small number of Australians.
It is incumbent upon all Australians to work together to reject ideologies that promote violence, no matter from
where they arise or to what purpose they aspire. We must all support and protect the values and freedoms
from which all Australians benefit. By reducing disadvantage, addressing real or perceived grievances and
encouraging full participation in Australia’s social and economic life, government policies can help to mitigate
any marginalisation and radicalisation that may otherwise occur within the Australian community.

Terrorism will continue to pose challenges to Australia’s national security for the foreseeable future.
The Government is committed to the continuous improvement of Australia’s counter-terrorism efforts,
and will pursue a range of measures to protect Australia, its people and interests from terrorism.
Our coordinated, multilayered approach is aimed at ensuring that counter-terrorism efforts are effective
and conducted in a manner that enhances our wider national security.

The Government remains committed to taking all necessary and practical action to keep Australia safe.

### 1 Introduction

Terrorism is the use of violence by groups or individuals pursuing political objectives. Terrorists are frequently
indiscriminate in their attacks and can deliberately target civilians and non-combatants, often seeking to
inflict mass casualties.

The purpose of this Counter-Terrorism White Paper, Securing Australia – Protecting our Community, is to:

� explain the nature of the terrorist threat to Australia within Australia’s broader national security context;

� set out the Australian Government’s strategy for countering terrorism; and

� detail the policy settings by which the Government will implement its counter-terrorism strategy.

This White Paper reflects a number of improvements to Australia’s approach to counter-terrorism. It
brings together for the first time, in a comprehensive manner, Australia’s response to terrorism both
domestically and internationally.

The strategy outlined in this White Paper sets out a comprehensive response to terrorism while upholding the
fundamental rights and freedoms of all Australians. Preventing terrorist acts, and dissuading those who might
seek to commit them, is a complex challenge for all levels of government and the Australian community more
broadly. The responses and measures outlined in this White Paper are targeted and proportionate, and take into
account the evolving strategic environment and the lessons we have learnt over recent years.

Australia’s counter-terrorism policies form part of the Government’s comprehensive national security strategy.
Australia faces a range of complex, dynamic and evolving security challenges. The National Security Statement
of 2008 set out the Government’s vision for a coherent approach to addressing these challenges. Australia must
be clear in its analysis of the threats and challenges we face, actively manage them, and seize opportunities to
enhance our overall national security.

This White Paper sets out Australia’s counter-terrorism objectives and the means by which the Government
will pursue them. The nature of the threat is explained in Chapter two and the Government’s counter‑terrorism
strategy is detailed in Chapter three. The various elements of our strategy are detailed in Chapters four to seven.

### 2 The Threat

The threat of terrorism to Australia and our interests is real. Terrorism has become a persistent and permanent
feature of Australia’s security environment. It threatens Australians and Australian interests both at home and
overseas. The Government’s intelligence agencies assess that further terrorist attacks could occur at any time.

Over the past century the world has seen a succession of terrorist campaigns supporting various ideological or
nationalist causes. Methods of attack have evolved and terrorists have proved innovative, adaptive and ruthless
in pursuing their goals.

Terrorism affected Australia before the 11 September 2001 attacks against the United States. Various overseas
terrorist groups have long had a presence in Australia – focused largely on fundraising and procurement,
occasionally escalating to violence. But prior to the rise of self-styled jihadist[1] terrorism fostered by al-Qa’ida,
Australia itself was not a specific target. We now are.

Terrorist attacks in Australia before 2001

Terrorist attacks conducted in Australia before 2001 include:

� the 1972 bombing of the Yugoslav General Trade Agency in Sydney;

� the 1978 bombing of the Sydney Hilton hotel during a Commonwealth Heads of Government

Regional Meeting;

� the 1980 assassination of the Turkish Consul-General in Sydney;

� the 1982 bombing of the Israeli Consulate and the Hakoah Club in Sydney; and

� the 1986 bombing at the Turkish Consulate in Melbourne.

Since 2001, more than 100 Australians have been killed in terrorist attacks overseas. Numerous other attacks
have been thwarted in Australia. Thirty-eight people have been prosecuted or are being prosecuted as a
result of counter-terrorism operations, 35 of whom were prosecuted for terrorism offences pursuant to the
_Criminal Code Act 1995_ (the Criminal Code). A number of these prosecutions are ongoing. Twenty people
have been convicted of terrorism offences under the Criminal Code. More than 40 Australians have had their
passports revoked or applications denied for reasons related to terrorism.

1 The term ‘jihadist’ is an imperfect descriptor that has multiple meanings. It is, however, a term that has been appropriated by many terrorist
groups to describe their activities, and it is commonly used by security services and public commentators across the world to describe them.


-----

2.1 The current threat

The main source of international terrorism and the primary terrorist threat to Australia and Australian interests
today comes from people who follow a distorted and militant interpretation of Islam that calls for violence as
the answer to perceived grievances. This broad movement comprises al‑Qa’ida, groups allied or associated with
it, and others inspired by a similar worldview but not formally linked to al‑Qa’ida networks. Their constituency,
while small in global terms, shows every sign of persisting even if al-Qa’ida’s current senior leadership were to
be killed or captured.

Al-Qa’ida has been the vanguard of an international movement of like-minded groups and influences its
direction through both propaganda and actions. Its extremist ideology, goals and interpretations of world
events allow local grievances to be worked into its global vision. This message resonates with jihadist terrorists
around the world and continues to attract new adherents. Their activities challenge governments and
communities globally, and threaten prosperity and security in various parts of the world.

Al-Qa’ida remains a significant, but not the only, threat. It has links to other extremist groups operating in various
parts of the world. Some of these have entered into a formal association with core al-Qa’ida and adopted
names that reflect this, such as ‘al-Qa’ida in Iraq’ and ‘al-Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula’. Others have remained
independent but have ongoing operational, training, propaganda or logistic cooperation with al-Qa’ida.
‘Lone wolf’ attackers with no group affiliation but motivated by the same ideology can emerge at any time.

A distorted narrative

Many distinct terrorist networks with differing and often local objectives share a broadly common set
of beliefs that narrowly and simplistically interprets history and current affairs through the lens of the
alleged oppression of Muslims, principally by the West. Groups like al‑Qa’ida want people to believe:

� the West, led by the United States of America, is engaged in the systematic exploitation and

repression of Muslims;

� governments in Muslim majority countries are illegitimate, corrupt and un‑Islamic;

� the solution is the removal of Western interference in Muslim majority countries and the

establishment of ‘truly Islamic’ systems of governance; and

� it is the religious duty of all Muslims individually to use violence to attack the political, military,

religious and cultural enemies of Islam anywhere around the world.

2.1.1 A persistent threat

Personal and social connections between groups and networks have been central to the rise of the so called
‘global jihad’. These connections form the platform for the planning and execution of terrorist attacks. It is in
these extra-organisational networks that much of the current threat subsists. This relative lack of formal structure
contributes to the movement’s resilience and complicates counter‑terrorism efforts. While fragmentation and
autonomy impose certain operational constraints on terrorist groups, it also makes it easier for them to evade
detection by security agencies and to adjust their tactics in response to successful counter-terrorism measures.

Although damaged by the death or capture of many of its leading figures, al-Qa’ida has shown the capacity to
regenerate quickly. As the al-Qa’ida core leadership in the border areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan has come
under increasing pressure, its ability to train new terrorists, move them to the West and successfully launch
attacks has been degraded. But it still has a substantial pool of operatives capable in their own right of planning
and conducting attacks and helping other like‑minded extremists across the globe. It continues to run a global
propaganda campaign and remains an inspiration to other like-minded networks and individuals operating
outside its direct control.

Any reduction of the ability of core al-Qa’ida to project terrorism beyond its immediate region has been offset
by the rise of those affiliated with, or inspired by, its message and methods. The ability of some of these to reach
into the West is increasing. We are seeing more real and potential threats to the West from countries such as
Somalia and Yemen. A major concern is that this represents a new generation committed to terrorism.

These groups are a determined and capable adversary that has proved highly adaptive. They have the capacity
to learn from their mistakes, adapt to counter-terrorism measures, and to regenerate. And they are innovative in
their tactics and methods and have shown a dogged persistence in pursuing their goals, repeatedly following
up failed attempts with successful attacks.

The scale of threat cannot be estimated with certainty beyond the next few years. It may expand or contract in
response to political, social or geo-strategic events. If global counter-terrorism efforts gain more ground, it may
subside. But we can confidently assume that some violent jihadists will retain an abiding motivation to continue
their attacks. Periodic attacks or attempted attacks, including those inflicting mass casualties, can be expected
for some time to come.

2.1.2 The international threat

Since the last counter-terrorism White Paper the geography of the threat has changed. Counter‑terrorism
efforts have had an impact, as have groups exploiting lawless spaces, poor governance and regional grievances.
Over the past five years some parts of the world have remained constant areas of concern while other, newer
areas such as Somalia and Yemen have risen to prominence.

The unstable environment in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the potential for political violence there to spread
more widely in South Asia and beyond, is of the greatest concern globally. The threat of terrorism in South Asia,
a region with nuclear arms, is compounded by the continued safe haven that al-Qa’ida and other jihadists have
found there. Groups such as Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish e Mohammed are likely to continue to train militants
within Pakistan, maintain links with al‑Qa’ida and stage attacks in neighbouring India.

South-East Asian countries, notably Indonesia, have had significant success against terrorism in recent years.
But the Jakarta hotel attacks in July 2009 underscore the ongoing threat to Indonesians, Australians and
others from terrorism in our region. The region has become home to loosely affiliated terrorist networks,
including those associated with Jemaah Islamiyah and the Abu Sayyaf Group. Despite continued regional
counter-terrorism successes, including the killing in 2009 of terrorist leader Noordin Mohammed Top by
Indonesian security forces, these groups will continue to adapt, combining local and international agendas
in unpredictable ways. So the danger to Australian lives and interests in the region will persist.


-----

Jemaah Islamiyah and its offshoots

Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) has been the most prominent terrorist group in South‑East Asia since the late
1990s. Its roots lie in Indonesia’s Darul Islam movement, formed in the 1940s, which sought to create an
Islamic state in Indonesia. The involvement of JI’s founding members in the Afghan‑Soviet conflict and
the personal connections they formed at that time galvanised their belief that their cause is part of an
international struggle.

JI, or its offshoots, have been responsible for most of the major anti-Western attacks affecting
Australians, including:

� The 12 October 2002 Bali bombing that killed 202 people, including 88 Australians.

� The 5 August 2003 JW Marriott bombing in Jakarta that killed 12 people.

� The 9 September 2004 bombing of the Australian Embassy in Jakarta that killed 10 people.

� The 1 October 2005 Bali bombings that killed 26 people, including four Australians.

� The 17 July 2009 JW Marriott and Ritz Carlton hotel bombings that killed 7 people,

including three Australians.

The Middle East and the Gulf host a variety of different terrorist groups. Most countries in the region have firm
measures to strictly control their activity, but it remains latent and could recur. In the likely absence of political
and social reform or an economic renaissance, the region is likely to witness cycles of terrorist activity and
ruthless repression. Most recently the emergence and growth of al-Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP)
poses a significant threat to an already unstable Yemen. AQAP has already conducted attacks in Saudi Arabia
and claimed responsibility for the 2009 Christmas Day attempted bombing of an airliner bound for Detroit.

The challenges seen in the Middle East also occur in North Africa. Groups such as al-Qa’ida in the Islamic
Maghreb have proved particularly adept at reinventing themselves, adopting local grievances and extending
their field of operation into other parts of Africa, particularly the Sahel countries such as Mauritania, Mali and
Niger. Terrorist operations against Western interests there will recur and North Africa’s greater connection to
Western Europe allows local al-Qa’ida-inspired groups to pose a recurring threat to the European continent.

Terrorist activity in Somalia has intensified in recent years with the growth and consolidation of the al‑Shabab
group. No early return to stable government is in sight in Somalia and terrorist activity within the country and
the adjoining region can be expected for years to come.

The continuing resonance of the violent jihadist message within sections of Muslim communities in the Western
world (including Australia) will lead to the creation and activity of new violent cells. This will include groups
with little or no contact with core al-Qa’ida or its affiliates. The emergence of these groups is likely to be uneven
across the West – indications are that for now, the phenomenon may have the biggest impact in the UK and
parts of Europe but the US and Australia will not be immune. The scale of the problem will continue to depend
on factors such as the size and make-up of local Muslim populations, including their ethnic and/or migrant
origins, their geographical distribution and the success or otherwise of their integration into their host society.

National Security Adviser, Mr Duncan Lewis AO.

2.1.3 The international and domestic threat to Australia

Australia is a terrorist target. Public statements by prominent terrorist leaders and other extremist
propagandists have singled out Australia for criticism and encouraged attacks against us both before and
after 11 September 2001. Although al-Qa’ida has not itself launched a direct attack on Australia, it has shown
an operational interest in doing so. We know that in 2000 Australian national Jack Roche was tasked by senior
al-Qa’ida operative Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to identify Israeli and Jewish targets in Australia, and in 2001
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed applied for and was granted a visa to visit Australia (cancelled before he could travel).

We continue to see terrorist planning within Australia by terrorists inspired by al‑Qa’ida. This is an important shift
since the publication of the last White Paper. The 7 July 2005 bombings of the London transit system highlighted
the threat of globally-inspired but locally generated attacks in Western democracies. This is a threat to which
Australia is not immune.

� In 2005, nine men in Sydney were arrested and charged with terrorism offences. All nine were convicted of

terrorism offences.

� In 2006, Australian national Faheem Lodhi was convicted of planning terrorist attacks in Australia during

2003. Lodhi was working with French national Willie Brigitte who had been sent to Australia by a senior
Lashkar-e-Tayyiba member. Brigitte was subsequently convicted on terrorism charges in France.


-----

� In September 2008, a Sydney man was convicted of collecting or making documents likely to facilitate

terrorist acts.

� In 2006, 13 men in Melbourne were arrested and charged with terrorism offences. Nine were convicted of

being members of a terrorist organisation.

� Other terrorism-related cases are currently before the courts.

So far, terrorist attempts in Australia have been disrupted by the coordinated and highly professional efforts
of Australia’s security agencies and police services, with support from international partners. But this success
should not give us any false confidence that all plots here can be discovered and disrupted.

There remain a significant number of Australian extremists radicalised to the point of being willing to engage
in violence to advance their political aims. There is also a wider, but still small, group sympathetic to al-Qa’ida’s
beliefs, some of whom may be further radicalised in the years ahead. Australians sympathetic to terrorist causes
also continue to provide financial support for terrorist groups overseas.

A number of Australians are known to subscribe to the violent jihadist message. Many of these individuals were
born in Australia and they come from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds. The pool of those committed to
violent extremism in Australia is not static, over time some move away from extremism while others become
extreme. Since the last counter-terrorism White Paper, security investigations have identified many new
individuals of security concern.

Some have travelled overseas, or facilitated the travel of others, to engage in terrorist training and fighting
– and it is likely that others will seek to do so in the future. It is also possible that Australians travelling or living
overseas will be exposed to extremist ideas, become radicalised, connect to terrorist networks and engage in
terrorism. Regardless of where radicalisation occurs, Australian extremists have engaged in terrorist activity,
not only in Australia but also in other countries. We expect this to continue.

The conviction of individuals in Australia on terrorism charges and ongoing investigations clearly demonstrate
that there are Australians who are committed to supporting or engaging in violent jihad in Australia and
elsewhere. Most of these were born in Australia or have lived here since childhood. The emergence and activity
of terrorist cells in Australia, inspired by the narrative espoused by al-Qa’ida, is likely to continue, including those
with little or no contact with core al-Qa’ida or its affiliates.

2.1.4 Other forms of terrorism

Jihadist terrorism is the predominant focus of Australia’s current counter‑terrorism efforts due to its spread,
impact and explicit targeting of Australians. But terrorism motivated by other beliefs has affected Australia
in the past and will affect us in the future.

Australia is currently home to a small number of people who support other causes that involve active terrorist
campaigns overseas. The terrorist movements they support do not necessarily see Australia or Australians as a
target for their violence but some might see that Australia could be used as a suitable or convenient location for
an attack on their enemies. This includes groups with a long history of engaging in terrorist acts and a current
capability to commit them, such as Lebanese Hizballah’s External Security Organisation.

Future geo-political events could mean other terrorist movements with a presence or support base in Australia
could become willing to engage in operational activity here. And in the future new terrorist threats could
manifest themselves in Australia, either as a by-product of events overseas or as a result of a political grievance
within Australia. There will always be the disaffected and disempowered, often but not always at the fringes of
communities or the followers of radical ideologies, who mistakenly see advantages in the use of terrorist tactics.


-----

Attacks using CBRN

The attacks on 11 September 2001 highlighted how creative and ruthless terrorist attack planning can
be. The potential for terrorist use of chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN) weapons is of
particular concern. We know that a small number of terrorists seek CBRN weapon capabilities and would
use them if they could. While the risk is small, the consequences of any such attack would be devastating.

The acquisition of a nuclear weapon is currently beyond terrorist capability though a crude, low-yield
nuclear device is possible. An attack with a radiological dirty bomb, biological materials or industrial
chemicals is feasible and could have a significant impact even if it only succeeded in generating
widespread panic. But obtaining, producing, handling and deploying such weapons is difficult.
Domestic and international efforts to secure CBRN materials are crucial to limit the risk of a CBRN attack.

2.1.5 Outlook

Al-Qai’da and like-minded terrorist groups and individuals have suffered setbacks but continue to adapt to
counter-terrorism efforts and exploit changing geo‑political circumstances. The nature of the beliefs that inspire
them and their emotional appeal in some quarters means that such groups will remain a security threat for years
to come. Adherents believe that they are fighting a war that will last for generations, so setbacks are accepted
and persistence is expected.

Al-Qa’ida has not given up its goal of conducting catastrophic attacks in Western countries, despite pressures on
it. And planning for further attacks by globally-inspired local individuals who subscribe to the same worldview is
unlikely to decline in the short to medium term.

2.1.6 A long-term challenge

Coordinated counter-terrorism efforts will continue to be vital to curb the threat of terrorism. To be successful,
our efforts need to be conducted on many levels. Finding and bringing terrorists to justice, and improving
controls over financial flows, border movements and communication channels constrain the ability of terrorist
groups to operate. Important progress has been made on these fronts but many terrorists have proved adept
at finding ways to circumvent counter-terrorism measures and remain free and operationally active.

Terrorism will continue to pose a serious challenge to Australia and to international security. Terrorist networks
will continue to aspire to conduct further attacks and to alter their methods to defeat counter-terrorism
measures. We must remain ready to meet this challenge and work productively with the international
community and the governments of Australia to thwart terrorist groups and lessen the appeal of their
extreme views.

### 3 Australia’s Counter-Terrorism Strategy

The aim of Australia’s counter-terrorism strategy is to protect Australia, its people and interests from terrorism.

The Government’s strategy has four elements:

1. **Analysis: an intelligence-led response to terrorism driven by a properly connected and properly informed**
national security community.

2. **Protection: taking all necessary and practical action to protect Australia and Australians from terrorism at**
home and abroad.

3. **Response: providing an immediate and targeted response to specific terrorist threats and terrorist attacks**
should they occur.

4. **Resilience: building a strong and resilient Australian community to resist the development of any form of**
violent extremism and terrorism on the home front.

We will pursue these objectives informed by the following core judgements:

� Countering terrorism requires a long-term commitment, and complementary international and

domestic efforts.

� To prevent acts of terrorism, and anticipate evolving terrorist intentions and tactics, our efforts must

be intelligence-led and highly coordinated across agency and governmental boundaries.

� A risk-informed and layered approach to counter-terrorism is essential because no single measure

will be fully effective.

� Our efforts should always seek to be lawful, proportionate and accountable.

� Australia must have in place mechanisms that allow us to respond seamlessly to and recover from acts of

terrorism should they occur.

� The support and cooperation of business and the community are essential to extend the reach

and effectiveness of government counter-terrorism efforts.

3.1 Elements of Australia’s counter-terrorism strategy

3.1.1 Analysis: an intelligence-led response to terrorism driven by a properly connected
and properly informed national security community

Australia’s counter-terrorism efforts are intelligence-led and focused on prevention. This approach hinges on strong
partnerships and cooperation at the national level, effective engagement at the international level, and effective
information sharing. Over recent years, there has been significant growth in Australia’s security, intelligence and law
enforcement agencies and the Government has taken steps to improve their capabilities and enhance information
sharing. The establishment of the National Intelligence Coordination Committee has ensured that Australia’s
intelligence effort, both domestically and internationally, is better integrated into the new national security
arrangements. The creation of a new Counter-Terrorism Control Centre will also ensure that we better integrate our
overall counter-terrorism intelligence capabilities.. Our efforts to ensure an intelligence-led response to terrorism
delivered by a connected and informed national security community are detailed in Chapter four.


-----

3.1.2 Protection: taking all necessary and practical action to protect Australia
and Australians from terrorism at home and abroad

The Government is committed to taking action to protect Australians and reduce the risk of attack.
This approach involves efforts at a number of complementary levels, including:

� strong border management arrangements to prevent the movement of individuals who try to enter

or transit Australia to conduct terrorism-related activities by introducing a new biometric-based visa
system for certain non-citizens – making it harder for terrorists to evade detection;

� preventing Australians suspected of involvement in terrorism from travelling overseas by revoking

or denying passports;

� improving the security of our airports to enhance protection of the travelling public;

� continued cooperation and collaboration with the states and territories through comprehensive national

counter-terrorism arrangements;

� working in partnership with the business community to protect our critical infrastructure,

including information and communications technology; and

� strengthened collaboration with international partners, both bilaterally and multilaterally, to contribute to

international counter-terrorism efforts and create an international environment that is hostile to terrorism.

Details of the Government’s efforts to protect Australia and Australians at home and abroad are discussed
in Chapter five.

3.1.3 Response: providing an immediate and targeted response to specific terrorist
threats and terrorist attacks should they occur

The Government’s ability to prevent and disrupt terrorist attacks within Australia relies on coordinated and
cooperative relationships between our intelligence, security and law enforcement agencies nationally.
This collaborative approach ensures that we have a robust and effective national capacity to respond to terrorist
threats. Australia’s comprehensive national response uses the full array of Commonwealth, state and territory
counter-terrorism capabilities. It is underpinned by a legal regime that provides effective powers for our agencies
and the ability to prosecute people who seek to conduct terrorist acts. The Government will keep these powers
under review against any further need to expand them or tailor them to deal with any changes in the nature of
the threat in the future. Australia’s comprehensive approach to providing an immediate and targeted response
to terrorist threats and recovering from an attack is set out in Chapter six.

3.1.4 Resilience: building a strong and resilient Australian community to resist the
development of any form of violent extremism and terrorism on the home front

Australia’s counter-terrorism efforts are supported by our open democratic society. There are inherent strengths
in our society that make Australia resilient to the divisive worldview of al-Qa’ida and like-minded groups.
However, we know from experience that the terrorist narrative may resonate with a small number of Australians.
It is incumbent upon all Australians to work together to reject ideologies that promote violence, no matter from
where they arise or to what purpose they aspire. We must all support and protect the values and freedoms
from which all Australians benefit. By reducing disadvantage, addressing real or perceived grievances and
encouraging full participation in Australia’s social and economic life, government policies can help to mitigate
any marginalisation and radicalisation that may otherwise occur within the Australian community. How we
will counter violent extremism is explained in Chapter seven.

3.2 The way Australia will pursue our objectives

In pursuit of our aim to protect Australia, its people and interests from terrorism, we must take a comprehensive
and layered approach. Our counter-terrorism measures must be informed by strategic judgements about the
nature of the threat and Australia’s vulnerability to it. And we must conduct our activities in a manner that
harnesses our capabilities, upholds our principles and mitigates the risk of attack or failure in our response.

3.2.1 International and domestic activities

International terrorism challenges any notion of separate domestic and international security realms.
Australia must pursue a range of counter-terrorism measures internationally to counter the threat to our
interests both overseas and domestically. Given the transnational nature of the threat and the willingness
of some terrorist groups to export terrorism to countries like Australia, our international efforts support
our domestic security. The narrative espoused by al‑Qa’ida will continue to resonate with some members
of our society, so we should also ensure that our efforts to counter terrorism domestically are informed by
best-practice models internationally.


-----

-----

3.2.2 Intelligence-led and coordinated preventive measures

Terrorism requires an active, preventive and adaptive response across the full range of government
counter‑terrorism measures. It presents challenges across all levels of government and our response involves
a broad range of government agencies. Over recent years, there has been significant growth in Australia’s
security, intelligence and law enforcement agencies designed to enhance Australia’s counter-terrorism capacity.
The Government has also taken steps to enhance information sharing. The newly established NICC ensures
that Australia’s intelligence effort, both domestically and internationally, is better integrated into the new
national security arrangements. The national approach to counter-terrorism is based upon strong, cooperative,
coordinated and consultative relationships between our agencies. The agencies cooperate to conduct
preventive operations.

3.2.3 A risk-informed and layered approach

Intelligence plays a critical role in identifying, investigating and anticipating threats, developing preventive
responses and determining the areas of greatest need for our counter-terrorism efforts. It also provides the
basis to identify opportunities to more effectively focus counter‑terrorism efforts, disrupt terrorist acts or make
changes to our counter-terrorism measures on the basis of risk‑informed assessments. No one counter-terrorism
measure can protect all of our interests or preclude attack. As a result, Australia’s approach to counter-terrorism
relies on complementary security layers designed on the basis of assessments of risk, involving threat,
vulnerability and the potential consequences of attack. These layers collectively strengthen Australia’s
national security.

3.2.4 A lawful, proportionate and accountable response

To be effective, Australia must pursue a principled and proportionate response that promotes and upholds
the values we seek to protect. The Government does not support the use of torture or other unlawful methods
in response to terrorism. Terrorism is a crime and the Government will pursue terrorists within proper legal
frameworks and in accordance with the rule of law. A response based on our democratic values and universal
human rights serves to undermine the narrative of terrorist groups that seek to portray our actions, and those
of our allies, as oppressive. In recognition of the importance of our counter‑terrorism and security legislation,
the Government has introduced legislation to establish an Independent National Security Legislation Monitor
to regularly and independently review the operation of Australia’s counter‑terrorism laws.

3.2.5 Effective national arrangements

Cooperative federalism is a vital part of Australia’s counter-terrorism strategy. Australian governments have
overlapping responsibility for protecting our communities, infrastructure and assets and the interests of
Australia as a whole against terrorism. Australia’s national approach to counter‑terrorism is coordinated
through a comprehensive set of arrangements. The National Counter‑Terrorism Plan sets out arrangements and
responsibilities for dealing with terrorism. The Commonwealth and the states and territories routinely conduct
multi-jurisdictional exercises to enhance Australia’s national counter‑terrorism and emergency management
capabilities. These exercises test national and jurisdictional counter-terrorism arrangements with a focus on
consequence management, including the simulation of large-scale and multiple-site mass casualty incidents.

counter-terrorism exercises.


-----

3.2.6 Cooperation between governments, business and communities

As the owners and operators of infrastructure that may be targeted by terrorists, the business community has
a key role to play in Australia’s response to terrorism and in supporting resilience within our economy and
community. Communities also play a leading role in rejecting extremist ideologies and supporting individuals
who are at risk of marginalisation, or who might be attracted to the use of violent expression to achieve political,
social or ideological goals. Communities can also assist our law enforcement and security agencies to help
prevent acts of terrorism.

### 4 Analysis

An intelligence-led response to terrorism driven by a properly connected and

properly informed national security community

Terrorist networks are clandestine. They hide and obfuscate their activities to avoid detection and disruption.
To be effective against terrorism, the Government needs access to intelligence that will uncover terrorists,
their methods and plans.

An intelligence-led approach

As Australia confronts an evolving and increasingly complex national security environment,
the importance of intelligence to inform our responses to challenges will increase. Intelligence is
information, obtained covertly or otherwise, that provides insight and advantage. It is by its nature
sensitive information. It can be a single piece of information, or a conglomerate of fused, corroboratory
material from various sources that is the result of careful analysis and assessment. Intelligence is collected
in many forms by agencies across the national security community including, but not limited to,
the intelligence collection agencies of the Australian intelligence community. Numerous agencies utilise
this intelligence to identify emerging threats and determine operational or policy responses.

4.1 An effective intelligence capability

The ability to collect, analyse and share information expeditiously is critical to protecting Australia and its
people from attack. The Australian intelligence community comprises agencies charged with collecting human
intelligence, signals intelligence and imagery, and assessment agencies which analyse and interpret intelligence
and data from other sources. Both arms of the intelligence community – collection and assessment – contribute
to all aspects of our counter-terrorism effort.

The terrorist threat demands close cooperation between Australia’s foreign intelligence, security intelligence,
law enforcement, financial intelligence and criminal intelligence agencies, and also with international partners.
Our intelligence capabilities must also evolve to ensure that they keep pace with changes in the operational
security methods of terrorist groups or their use of new technologies. The nature of intelligence, which is often
fragmentary or imprecise, is such that there can be no guarantee of prior warning of terrorist attacks.

4.1.1 A new approach to counter-terrorism intelligence coordination

The Government has moved to strengthen Australia’s counter-terrorism intelligence activities by better
integrating and coordinating capabilities across the national intelligence community through the
establishment of a Counter-Terrorism Control Centre.


-----

The Counter-Terrorism Control Centre

The Government has decided to reshape the way it manages its counter-terrorism work. A multi-agency
Counter-Terrorism Control Centre will be established in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation
(ASIO) to set and manage counter-terrorism priorities, identify intelligence requirements, and ensure
that the processes of collecting and distributing counter‑terrorism information are fully harmonised and
effective across the spectrum of Australia’s counter-terrorism activity. It will support the established roles
of federal and state law enforcement authorities. It will be the key Commonwealth body for evaluating
and integrating counter‑terrorism intelligence. By strengthening the integration of our counter-terrorism
capabilities, the Centre will improve the ability of agencies to operate against terrorism and to detect and
prevent terrorist threats to Australians and Australia’s interests.

4.1.2 Working in partnership

Australia’s response to terrorism is driven by our understanding of current and emerging threats and the intent,
capability and operational methods of terrorist groups. Intelligence underwrites Australia’s understanding of
terrorism. It can play a vital role in preventing and disrupting the activities of terrorists threatening to attack Australia
and our interests. It can also drive preventive operational responses across Australia’s national security community.

Intelligence assessments are often built from fragmentary pieces of information. For this reason, our agencies
work collaboratively and share information to ensure that all of the capabilities of Australian agencies are
leveraged to minimise the risk of intelligence failure. The establishment of the National Intelligence Coordination
Committee (NICC) in 2009 has strengthened cooperation across Australia’s intelligence agencies and the
broader national security community.

The National Intelligence Coordination Committee

The National Intelligence Coordination Committee (NICC) is chaired by the National Security Adviser and
comprises the heads of the Office of National Assessments, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service,
the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation,
the Defence Intelligence Organisation, the Defence Signals Directorate, the AFP, the Australian Crime
Commission, and Customs and Border Protection. The departments of Defence, Foreign Affairs and Trade,
Immigration and Citizenship, and Attorney-General’s are also represented at the Deputy Secretary level.

The NICC enhances the ability of Australia’s security agencies to share information, coordinate effort and
identify opportunities to improve the whole-of-government response to terrorism and other national
security challenges.


-----

Australia’s relationships with foreign partners are also vital to prevent terrorist acts from occurring within
Australia. These relationships maximise the capabilities of our agencies and increase our access to information
and shared intelligence to support international counter-terrorism efforts. Our relationships with key intelligence
allies, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand, as well as wider partnerships and
exchanges including within the Asia‑Pacific region, South Asia, the Middle East and Europe, continue to
enhance Australia’s own capabilities, and add to the contestability and robustness of our intelligence product.

The Australian Intelligence Community

� The Office of National Assessments (ONA) provides all-source assessments on international political,

strategic and economic developments to the Prime Minister and senior ministers in the National
Security Committee of Cabinet.

� The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) collects security intelligence and identifies

and investigates threats to Australia’s security, wherever they arise, and provides assessments and
advice to protect Australia, its people and its interests.

� The Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) is Australia’s overseas secret human intelligence

(HUMINT) collection agency. ASIS’s mission is to protect and promote Australia’s vital interests
through the provision of unique foreign intelligence services as directed by the Government.

� The Defence Intelligence Organisation (DIO) is an intelligence assessment agency that supports

Defence and Government decision-making and assists with the planning and conduct of
Australian Defence Force (ADF) operations.

� The Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation (DIGO) provides geospatial intelligence,

from imagery and other sources, in support of Australia’s defence and national interests.

� The Defence Signals Directorate (DSD) supports Australian Government decision-makers and the

ADF with high quality foreign signals intelligence products and services. DSD also plays a key role
in protecting Australian official communications and information systems.

Australia’s national counter-terrorism effort also requires strong partnerships between relevant agencies and the
public. Information from the public has been vital in assisting our agencies to conduct successful investigations
into terrorist activities in the past. Knowledge and information about potential threats needs to flow between all
sections of the community and our law enforcement and security agencies.

The National Security Hotline has operated 24 hours a day since December 2002 as a direct point of contact
for the public to report possible indications of terrorism. The hotline is one of the ways members of the public
can work with governments to protect Australia from terrorism. As every piece of information can be critical,
its role in providing leads against terrorist threats is widely recognised across Australia’s national security
and law enforcement agencies. The National Security Hotline number is 1800 123 400.


-----

The National Threat Assessment Centre

The multi-agency National Threat Assessment Centre (NTAC) is located within ASIO and assesses
intelligence and information from a wide range of sources to prepare threat assessments in relation to
specific people, places, and events. These assessments inform the risk management decisions made
by operational agencies, the implementation of protective security measures and the travel advisories
regarding potential threats when travelling overseas that are prepared by the Department of Foreign
Affairs and Trade for the Australian public. ASIO also provides protective security advice to Australian
Government agencies and, with the approval of the Attorney-General, to state and territory governments
and private sector companies to protect vulnerable facilities.

4.1.3 Financial intelligence

Financial intelligence is an important tool in Australia’s operational counter-terrorism response. The Australian
Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) is both Australia’s Financial Intelligence Unit and the
regulator of Australia’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regime. AUSTRAC cooperates
closely with law enforcement agencies and provides unique, expert advice on suspicious movements of
funds, both domestically and offshore. It analyses this data to develop financial intelligence that is provided to
law enforcement and national security agencies, and to international counterparts as appropriate. The use of
sophisticated technology to draw links between otherwise unconnected transactions and personal information
strengthens the Australian law enforcement community’s ability to detect and disrupt groups that pose a threat
to Australia’s security.

Financial intelligence

AUSTRAC collects, analyses, and disseminates financial intelligence to 34 Australian law enforcement,
national security, revenue and social justice agencies, and to 56 overseas counterparts. This financial
intelligence comes from a range of financial transaction reports that are submitted to AUSTRAC.

Financial intelligence can play an instrumental role in identifying and prosecuting individuals involved
in terrorist financing, both in Australia and overseas. AUSTRAC works cooperatively with counterpart
agencies overseas to share and develop expertise and contribute to global action against money
laundering, serious crime and terrorism.


-----

4.1.4 Enhanced information sharing

The Government has also implemented new initiatives designed to strengthen information sharing across the
Australian Government national security community. This includes the appointment of a National Security Chief
Information Officer (NSCIO) to provide strategic coordination of the national security community’s information
management arrangements.

A key element of the NSCIO’s work is the development of a Roadmap detailing key measures to achieve by 2020
a more secure, coordinated and effective national security information management environment.

4.2 International intelligence cooperation

Intelligence cooperation with international partners forms a critical element of collective counter‑terrorism
efforts. Australia’s intelligence agencies have a broad network of international partners around the world.
These relationships provide the basis to share intelligence, assessments, expertise and capabilities. They also
enable us to collectively ‘join the dots’ and take action to disrupt terrorist networks and activities around the
globe. This cooperation is essential to countering terrorism – a crime that transcends borders and requires
intelligence capabilities that are flexible, dynamic and integrated.

Effective intelligence cooperation assists significantly in Australia’s ability to disrupt terrorist planning and
operations before they can target Australians or Australia’s interests, and to implement a range of measures
to mitigate emerging threats or to inform and contribute to international counter-terrorism efforts.
An understanding of a potential threat allows our agencies to respond appropriately – whether through
increased or changed protective security measures, or more targeted operational responses. Australia also
works to develop the capacity of security services in countries where Australia has counter‑terrorism interests.

A tangible example of the value of international intelligence cooperation is Australia’s Counter‑Terrorism
Intelligence Training Program (CTITP), established in 2005. It delivers counter‑terrorism training and capacity
building. CTITP contributes to the development of trusted, cooperative relationships with counterpart agencies.

4.3 A commitment to open and accountable oversight

The Inspector-General for Intelligence and Security (IGIS) provides independent assurance to the Government
and Parliament that the six agencies comprising Australia’s intelligence community act legally and with
propriety. The IGIS has broad powers to review, inspect, and inquire into the activities of the intelligence
agencies and report on their performance, including their counter-terrorism activities.

Effective oversight and accountability of the intelligence community remains crucial to ensure that the closer
integration between intelligence agencies and their partners remains consistent with our values and democratic
traditions. In recognition of the joint operational relationships between intelligence and law enforcement
agencies in counter-terrorism investigations, the Government is progressing legislative amendments to allow
inquiries by the IGIS to extend as necessary to other Commonwealth agencies that are not members of the
Australian intelligence community.

### 5 Protection

Taking all necessary and practical action to protect Australia and Australians from

terrorism at home and abroad

No government can guarantee that Australians will be free from the threat of terrorist attack.

The Government’s commitment to combat the threat by taking all necessary and practical measures requires
action at a range of levels to reduce the risk of attack. In addition to an effective intelligence capability,
Australia’s approach hinges on effective border management and transport security practices, strong
relationships between the Commonwealth and the states and territories, collaborative relationships with
business to protect our critical infrastructure and cooperative international relationships.

As the nature of the threat and our capabilities have evolved, the Government has taken specific steps to
improve the measures we take to protect Australians. Following the recent announcement of a $200 million
investment in aviation and border security, the Government will invest a further $69 million to introduce a
biometric-based visa system for certain non-citizens.

5.1 A strong border

As recent events such as the attempted bombing on Christmas Day 2009 of Northwest Airlines flight 253 in the
United States and the 2008 Mumbai attacks demonstrate, terrorists are willing and able to cross borders to conduct
or support attacks. The ability to identify and prevent the movement of individuals who try to enter or transit
Australia to conduct terrorist acts or terrorism-related activities is vital to Australia’s security. Each year a number
of visa applicants are refused entry to Australia on the basis of adverse security assessments – sometimes
because of suspected links to terrorist activity. And unauthorised arrivals who seek to remain in Australia are
subject to security checking.

Australia’s approach to border management is intelligence-led and risk-based. This means that interventions
are focused on high risk movements of people or goods, while low risk movements are facilitated
smoothly. Robust risk management strategies focus on reducing the chance of people or goods presenting
a risk to Australia reaching our shores. Our arrangements and measures focus on verifying and assessing the
identity and intent of people entering or leaving Australia, to prevent the movement of people who may
engage in terrorism-related or other criminal activity.

The Government is determined to ensure that Australia’s border management processes are world class.
The Government has endorsed a Strategic Border Management Plan to guide our border management
arrangements into the future, and has recently taken significant steps to enhance Australia’s approach to
securing the border. The key shift has been to change the way we think about our borders. Australia’s border
management agencies now devote far greater effort well beyond our shores to prevent terrorists, and other
persons of concern, from reaching our territory.


-----

Strengthening the border – biometric-based visas

The Government will invest $69 million over four years to introduce a biometric-based visa system
for certain non-citizens. From 2010–11 the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) will
collect biometrics (fingerprints and facial images) from visa applicants initially in ten overseas locations.
This data will be matched against DIAC’s biometric database and against the biometric databases of
our international partners. This initiative will reduce the risk of terrorists, criminals and other persons
of concern entering Australia undetected.

This measure complements a number of other enhancements recently announced following the review
of aviation security, including the development of:

� an Enhanced Passenger Assessment and Clearance program, to enable Customs and Border

Protection to assess a larger number of passengers earlier and faster and to store, analyse and
share relevant data with intelligence, border management and law enforcement agencies; and

� a Next Generation Border Security initiative, to use advanced data analysis and risk profiling to better

identify visa applicants who may present national security risks to our intelligence agencies.

5.1.1 Identity and intent management

The ability to confirm the identity of individuals travelling to Australia is of vital importance to a range of
Australia’s security interests. Individuals involved in terrorism or serious organised crime have previously
assumed false identities and used forged or fraudulently obtained documentation in an effort to circumvent
border management arrangements. The Government is strengthening Australia’s borders by moving towards
the collection of biometric information from non‑citizens as part of visa processing. This information will be
checked against immigration and law enforcement biometric databases in Australia and a number of partner
countries overseas.

Determining the reasons for an individual’s travel to Australia, before granting a visa or clearing the border, is also
a key element of Australia’s border management. A small proportion of potential visitors to Australia attempt to
deliberately misrepresent the intent of their travel, and efforts to increase our ability to determine intent protect
Australia from the entry of individuals who may pose a threat to our security or other interests. The Government
is working on new and innovative technologies to better identify and prevent high risk travellers from entering
Australia, while smoothly facilitating the movement of genuine travellers.

Just as Australia collaborates closely with international partners to identify foreign nationals of security concern
who may seek to travel to Australia, the Government is also committed to preventing Australian nationals from
engaging in terrorism-related activity overseas. The Government uses all available avenues to prevent people
from Australia who are of security concern from travelling internationally. This includes revoking or denying
passports. Over 40 Australians have had their passports revoked or denied for reasons related to terrorism.


-----

The border continuum

Movements across Australia’s border are managed through a layered approach within the border
continuum: overseas; within our maritime zone; at our physical border; and within Australia. Activities at
each layer contribute to the integrity of Australia’s border, and Australia’s border management processes
seek to pursue complementary activities at each layer to strengthen our arrangements.

Preventive work overseas to mitigate risks at the point of origin is supported by our activities in Australia’s
maritime zone to detect or interdict risks en route to, or departing from, Australia. Both types of activities
support our physical border (at airports and maritime ports) before people or materials arrive in Australia.
Robust processes at our points of entry and exit are similarly targeted to identify and prevent risks from
entering or leaving Australia, and are further supported by our domestic compliance and investigative
regime.

Australian agencies also actively monitor imports and exports to prevent goods of security concern transiting
our border. Customs and Border Protection utilises an intelligence-led approach to guide cargo assessment,
examination and seizure activities. This approach is supported by a strong legislative framework to enable
seizure of materials that are connected, directly or indirectly, to terrorism-related activities, or where the material
may prejudice Australian or international security.

5.1.2 Working ahead of the border to identify and manage risks

The physical border is increasingly becoming a secondary layer for risk assessment and intervention. Australian
agencies work closely with international counterparts to ensure that risks to Australia’s security, including from
terrorism, are identified and preventive measures are implemented before arrival at the Australian border.
Australian agencies are working cooperatively to push border clearance processes back as far as possible to
the point of origin. This means that checking and screening commences well before people, cargo, vessels and
aircraft cross Australia’s physical border. This approach strengthens Australia’s border and limits interruptions to
legitimate travel and trade.

The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) manages the universal visa system and, in close
cooperation with other agencies, particularly ASIO, establishes the identity and intent of travellers to Australia,
assesses their security risk, and confirms they have a valid authority to travel to and enter Australia.

Customs and Border Protection is working to develop mutual recognition of border processes with other
countries, including pre-export examination upon request and access to pre-departure and pre‑arrival data.
This approach increases the security of movements to Australia prior to their departure.

5.1.3 Enhancing our ability to conduct traveller risk assessments

Increasing the level of certainty about the relative risk that travellers represent as early as possible in the
traveller pathway, enables border protection, law enforcement and intelligence agencies to make risk-based
interventions and resource deployment decisions. Government agencies are working to enhance traveller risk
assessment, which is crucial to address the forecast growth in traveller numbers, and current and emerging risks.
Underpinning traveller risk assessment is certainty about a person’s identity and their intentions when planning
and undertaking travel to and from Australia.


-----

-----

While the current traveller risk assessment regime is sound, the approach can be better integrated. Recent
advances in technology will provide opportunities to fuse biometric and biographical information together with
intelligence to improve risk assessment, watch list and intervention outcomes. Along with the collection, storage
and appropriate sharing of advance traveller information, this capability can be deployed earlier and faster
to support the identification and assessment of potential persons of interest before a visa is granted, before
boarding, en route, and at the physical border. This in turn better informs whole of government decision-making
about the appropriate intervention response, and the point at which that intervention might take place.

5.1.4 Engagement with and building the capacity of our international partners

An effective regional border management regime can play an important role in thwarting terrorists and
disrupting the illicit movement of people, materials and finances across borders. International engagement
also strengthens Australia’s border by contributing to the development and implementation of security
policy frameworks and border management processes overseas. This is particularly important given the
interdependence of border management and transport security regimes worldwide.

Australian agencies are working closely with counterpart border management agencies in Indonesia, the
Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and in the Pacific to increase their capacity to identify and mitigate
security risks, enhance border management processes – such as screening and detection capabilities – and
strengthen inter-agency cooperation across the region. Australia is also helping to build the capacity of border
and law enforcement officials in the region to detect, deter and prevent illicit financial flows across borders.

DIAC is working bilaterally with Indonesia’s Direktorat Jenderal Imigrasi to strengthen borders through the
Border Management Capacity Building Partnership (CEKAL). This initiative facilitates the detection of people of
immigration concern and assists in preventing people smuggling and irregular migration across the Indonesian
archipelago. DIAC’s capacity building programs are aimed at assisting countries in the region to strengthen their
ability to curb illegal and irregular transborder movements.

5.2 Aviation security

Transport systems are inherently vulnerable to terrorist attack because they are open systems that gather large
numbers of people at predictable times in predictable places. The attacks in the United States on 11 September
2001, in Madrid in 2004, London in 2005, and the attempted attacks against transatlantic flights departing from
the United Kingdom in 2006 and in the United States on 25 December 2009, highlight the vulnerability of the
transport system as both a target of, and potential weapon for, terrorist groups. Australia’s transport security is
based upon an intelligence-led, risk-based, preventive and layered approach to increase the security of travel
and reduce the risk of a terrorist attack.

Strengthening Australia’s aviation security

On Christmas Day 2009, Nigerian national Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab attempted to detonate an
improvised explosive device onboard North West Airlines flight 253 (NW253). In response to this incident,
the Government will invest $200 million over four years to further enhance and strengthen Australia’s
aviation and border security regime.

The Government will assist industry to introduce a range of new screening technologies at airports,
including:

� body scanners at international gateway airports;

� next generation multi-view X-ray machines;

� bottle scanners capable of detecting liquid-based explosives; and

� X-ray screening, and increased explosive trace detection technology for air cargo.

The Government is also:

� introducing aviation security screening programs at more regional airports;

� increasing by 50% the number of firearms and explosives detector dogs at international airports; and

� expanding the Last Ports of Call program to improve the security of international flights travelling to

Australia.

Given Australia’s dependence on international and long distance domestic aviation and the interest terrorist
groups have shown in targeting this form of transport, our transport security efforts are closely integrated with
our border management arrangements. Border agencies, the AFP and state and territory police work closely
together, and with airport operators, to deter or respond to acts of terrorism in the aviation environment.

The Office of Transport Security (OTS) is responsible for preventive transport security policy and planning, and
plays a leading role in the national provision of best practice transport security risk and mitigation advice to the
owners and operators of transport services through the Government’s Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP)
program. In particular, OTS works closely with border protection, law enforcement and emergency response
agencies to ensure a coordinated approach to mitigating the risk posed to transport systems by terrorism.
Furthermore, the Commonwealth is responsible for preventive security measures in the offshore maritime
domain, particularly in relation to the prevention of and response to terrorism-related matters.

Commonwealth cooperation with the business community is also a critical part of the transport (aviation and
maritime) security regime. This engagement is undertaken in coordination with relevant state and territory
agencies. Industry is responsible for its own preventive security measures and bears the cost of these measures.
Industry participants best understand their local environment and operating circumstances and are well placed
to make the most effective decisions regarding sustainable mitigations and security outcomes to protect the
people and assets upon which it depends. Through effective engagement with industry, OTS not only supports
business growth and viability within the transport sector but works towards strengthening domestic security
arrangements and addressing areas of vulnerability.


-----

Layers of aviation security

Australia’s approach to aviation security relies on activities across the following complementary layers:

� intelligence to identify threats;

� effective and targeted mitigation strategies at last ports of call (the point of departure) to detect and

interdict risks before they depart for Australia;

� law enforcement measures;

� security measures at airports, including preventive physical and identity security measures and access

control;

� passenger, baggage and cargo screening; and

� aircraft security.

This approach provides flexibility within our aviation security efforts to adjust the layers as necessary in
response to changes in the nature of threat, technological advances and international arrangements.

Australia will continue to refine its approach to transport security, both domestically and internationally, to
take into account anticipated long-term growth in the aviation and maritime transport sector and changes in
the nature of the terrorist threat. As part of this approach, regular reviews of transport security are conducted.
The Government has recently reviewed its aviation security settings within the context of the National Aviation
Policy Statement, and is separately reviewing the provisions of the Maritime Security Identification Card scheme.
The purpose of these reviews is to ensure that Australia’s border and transport security arrangements continue
to be appropriate, comprehensive and cost-effective.

5.3 A cooperative national approach

Cooperative federalism is a vital part of Australia’s counter-terrorism strategy. Terrorism often presents
cross-jurisdictional challenges. Cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states and territories ensures
robust national capabilities to prevent terrorist attacks from occurring, to prosecute those who seek to conduct
them and to recover in the event of an attack. Australia’s domestic response to terrorism hinges on the national
counter‑terrorism arrangements which outline the complementary roles of the Commonwealth and the States
and Territories. Coordination between jurisdictions was formalised in 2002 through the Inter‑Governmental
Agreement on Australia’s National Counter-Terrorism Arrangements.

There are inherent strengths in Australia’s federal system. All jurisdictions recognise that we must work
together to protect Australia and its people. Across the jurisdictions our agencies are committed to continuous
improvement and work in partnership to identify opportunities to further develop our counter-terrorism
arrangements, and allocate resources strategically to deliver comprehensive national capabilities. The key to
making these national arrangements and processes work are the relationships between the policy areas, law
enforcement and intelligence across all jurisdictions and the ability to share information. Australia is well served
by cooperative and coordinated counter‑terrorism arrangements that utilise the strengths of all governments.

The National Counter-Terrorism Committee

The National Counter-Terrorism Committee (NCTC) was established in 2002 and reflects Australia’s
national approach. It facilitates cooperation between the Australian Government and state and territory
governments by meeting twice a year to discuss matters regarding Australia’s counter‑terrorism strategy.

The objectives of the NCTC are to contribute to the security of the Australian community by:

� maintaining the National Counter-Terrorism Plan and associated documentation;

� providing expert strategic and policy advice to heads of government and other relevant ministers;

� coordinating an effective national counter-terrorism capability;

� maintaining effective arrangements for the sharing of relevant intelligence and information between

all relevant agencies and jurisdictions; and

� providing advice in relation to the administration of the special fund to maintain and develop

national capabilities, administered by the Australian Government on the basis of advice
from the NCTC.

Specific policies adopted by individual jurisdictions will sometimes vary to suit local circumstances, but the
NCTC, which comprises senior officials from all Australian governments, provides the mechanism to agree
common standards, share information on best practice models and contest policy development to ensure
that our policy and operational responses are robust and effective.

All Australian governments are responsible for protecting their communities, infrastructure and assets and
the interests of Australia as a whole against terrorism. Australia’s national approach to counter‑terrorism is
coordinated through a comprehensive set of arrangements.

5.3.1 National counter-terrorism arrangements

The National Counter‑Terrorism Plan sets out arrangements and responsibilities for dealing with terrorism as
agreed by the Commonwealth and the states and territories. The Plan outlines effective national arrangements
to prevent, investigate, respond to, and recover from a terrorist incident; a comprehensive and complementary
legal regime; and robust cooperation, coordination and consultation between all relevant agencies and
jurisdictions. The Plan is reviewed by the NCTC at least every three years to ensure that the arrangements
remain effective.

Within the Plan, the Australian Government has a range of responsibilities including:

� a central role in the management of intelligence;

� setting national counter-terrorism alert levels;

� declaring – in consultation with affected jurisdictions – a National Terrorist Situation;

� coordinating the maintenance of national counter‑terrorism capabilities, plans and legislation; and

� providing support and assistance to a jurisdiction affected by a terrorist incident.


-----

The states and territories play a critical role in Australia’s domestic security and have developed policies
and dedicated resources to prevent, respond to and recover from a terrorist incident. Australia’s national
counter-terrorism arrangements recognise that most emergencies in Australia are dealt with by the affected
state or territory, with additional support provided by the Australian Government as necessary. Under the
national arrangements, states and territories have primary operational responsibility for responding to terrorist
incidents within their jurisdictions; the maintenance of local counter‑terrorism capabilities, plans and legislation.
They also work jointly with Commonwealth agencies on preventive strategies and operational responses to
terrorist threats.

In the event of a terrorist attack, the operational response would be controlled by the jurisdiction in which the
attack occurred, ensuring that resources could be deployed quickly and appropriately for local circumstance.
As in the case of a major natural disaster, the Commonwealth would work closely with the affected jurisdiction
to provide additional support as necessary, or take a more active role in the event that a National Terrorist
Situation is declared. In all cases the underlying principle is close cooperation between governments.

The Commonwealth and the states and territories routinely conduct multi-jurisdictional exercises to enhance
Australia’s national counter-terrorism and emergency management capabilities. These exercises test national
and jurisdictional counter-terrorism arrangements with a focus on consequence management, including the
simulation of large-scale and multiple-site mass casualty incidents.

5.4 Protecting infrastructure

The business community plays an important role in protecting Australia’s infrastructure from terrorism. Australian
governments work with the business community to pursue common security interests, while acknowledging
separate public and private responsibilities. As the owners and operators in a range of areas that are potentially
vulnerable to exploitation or attack by terrorist groups – such as the transport sector, financial markets and
utilities – the business community has a key role to play in Australia’s response to terrorism. We know from
experience that mass transport systems, places where people gather in large numbers, and critical infrastructure
have been the target of terrorist attack overseas, and it is likely that these will remain attractive targets.

Critical infrastructure is a complex network of physical facilities, supply chains and information technology,
which is owned and operated by the private sector and Commonwealth and state and territory governments.
Australian governments work with the business community to ensure that adequate levels of protective security
are in place at critical infrastructure, based on assessed risk. This also involves ensuring minimal single points of
failure, and developing rapid, tested recovery arrangements. These arrangements are the subject of ongoing
review of their effectiveness.

The Critical Infrastructure Protection Program ensures that Australia’s critical infrastructure will be better
protected from, and be better able to continue to operate in the face of, all threats and hazards, including
terrorism. Work is underway to broaden this focus to include greater consideration of the resilience of our
essential services. The Trusted Information Sharing Network for critical infrastructure protection provides
a valuable mechanism for the Government and business to collaborate and identify solutions to common
security challenges.

Another key measure is the Critical Infrastructure Protection Modelling and Analysis capability, which shows
the potential impacts of terrorist attacks and other disasters on our communities, our infrastructure, and
the economy. This resource employs a range of tools, including highly complex computer models, to assist
business and government decision makers involved in counter-terrorism, critical infrastructure protection
and emergency management.


-----

-----

ASIO’s Business Liaison Unit (BLU) also provides reporting and advice on national security threats relevant to
the private sector to improve their ability to respond to such threats, both in Australia and internationally.

Government agencies are also continuing to work with industry to limit the opportunities for, and enhance
the detection of, the illegal or unauthorised use of security-sensitive CBRN materials, to establish a financial
environment hostile to the financing of terrorism, money laundering and other crime, and to give effect to
Australia’s border and transport security regime.

5.4.1 Cyber security

Information and communications technology permeates much of Australia’s critical infrastructure and underpins
our economy. It is vulnerable to exploitation by state or non‑state actors seeking to damage Australia’s economy
and necessitates an effective and coordinated response. The Government recently released a Cyber Security
Strategy (www.ag.gov.au/cybersecurity), which details how the Government is harnessing a broad range of
resources to assist and protect government, business and individual Australians in the online environment.

Although terrorists have not shown a strong interest in conducting cyber attacks, the Government has
implemented a range of measures to reduce the risk and consequences of any such attack on Australia’s
national interests. Working in partnership with the private sector – particularly in the banking and finance,
telecommunications and utilities sectors – the Government, through CERT Australia (www.cert.gov.au), provides
regular briefings on cyber security. CERT Australia will ensure that all Australians and Australian businesses have
access to information on how to better protect their information technology environments from cyber-based
threats and vulnerabilities. Information for all Australian internet users, including the simple steps they can take
to secure themselves online, is available at www.staysmartonline.gov.au.

The Government has also established a Cyber Security Operations Centre to improve awareness of cyber threats
and to coordinate responses to cyber security incidents of national importance.

Hazardous materials of security concern

Terrorists have demonstrated an interest in acquiring chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear
materials that could be used against Australia or its interests. Governments across Australia are
implementing practical measures, particularly those recommended in the Council of Australian
Governments Review of Hazardous Materials, to limit opportunities for, and enhance detection
of, illegal or unauthorised use of chemical, biological and radiological materials by terrorists.

5.5 Working with the science and innovation community

Australia has significant capabilities for science and innovation that can be applied to our counter‑terrorism
efforts. We undertake world-leading national security science and innovation through publicly funded research
agencies, universities, national security agencies and industry. It is important that we encourage relevant work
that can build our counter‑terrorism and other national security capabilities. To this end, it is vital that we have
effective methods to identify, share and apply relevant knowledge and technologies as they emerge.

National security science and innovation

The Government has developed a National Security Science and Innovation Strategy (NSSIS) to enhance
the application of science and innovation to national security, including our counter‑terrorism efforts.
The NSSIS will build on the expertise and capabilities available within Australian government agencies,
universities and private sector organisations and ensure that Australia’s national security science and
innovation efforts are informed by a list of priorities that reflect the areas of greatest need.

Australia also works with a number of international partners through bilateral and multilateral
arrangements to develop new technologies and to share technical knowledge and information
which can enhance our counter-terrorism capabilities. The Department of the Prime Minister and
Cabinet manages two of these agreements with the United States of America – a Memorandum
of Understanding with the US Department of Defense Technical Support Working Group (TSWG)
and a treaty-level agreement administered with the US Department of Homeland Security.

These agreements provide Australia with access to national security research and technology that
is being developed by the United States. They have facilitated information sharing in a number of
important areas for counter-terrorism, including chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear materials,
improvised explosive device components, and X-ray technologies that can help trace the origin of
hazardous and illegal substances.


-----

5.6 Working with international partners

Australia operates in concert with a range of international partners in almost every aspect of our response
to terrorism. These relationships are critical to our efforts to protect Australia’s security, enhance security
and stability internationally, and to identify and respond to the challenges of international terrorism.
Active diplomacy underwrites our international activities.

The terrorist threat is dynamic and resilient and Australia will need to contribute to international
counter-terrorism efforts for the foreseeable future. The interdependence of our economy and security on
worldwide events cannot be ignored and we will need to continue to work with other nations to develop
robust and effective counter-terrorism measures and create an international environment that is hostile
to terrorism.

Australians are likely to continue to be more at risk of a terrorist attack overseas than at home. Australians can
be exposed to threats abroad as direct targets, as was the case in the 2002 Bali bombings in Indonesia, or more
broadly as indirect targets overseas. The danger of this threat is recognised in the travel advisory system for
Australians travelling overseas, managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

Security for major international sporting events is the responsibility of the host nation. However, Australia’s
security, law enforcement and intelligence agencies work closely with host nations to ensure security risks
to Australian athletes and spectators are minimised. The Government provides accurate and up-to-date
information about the risks Australians might face attending such events through the Department of
Foreign Affairs and Trade’s travel advice to assist them to make well-informed decisions about their attendance.
Government agencies also work closely with Australian sporting bodies to provide information about security
surrounding overseas events.

5.6.1 Working within the international system

Australia works within the international system to establish a coherent international legal regime to reduce
access by terrorist groups to funding and safe haven. Australia plays an active role in building the
United Nations’ unique capacity to condemn and confront terrorism in all its forms. The United Nations
Security Council has played a key role in global counter-terrorism by creating new obligations on member
states to counter terrorism. These agreed norms are pivotal in creating a global environment inimical to
terrorist groups. Australia is committed to all United Nations counter‑terrorism agreements.

Australia’s security can be affected directly by activities in regional countries, so we have a clear interest in
effective legal frameworks across our region that deal with terrorism. We work with other states in meeting
their international obligations to counter terrorism and we assist our neighbours in developing and maintaining
robust criminal laws and effective law enforcement and judicial processes.

In addition to Australia’s active work within the United Nations, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade also
manages Australia’s counter-terrorism engagement through the Group of 8 Counter-Terrorism Action Group.
We are active in building practical region‑wide action through Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the
Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), the ASEAN Regional Forum and the Pacific Islands Forum.

Building trust and reaching agreement on our objectives and action to counter-terrorism with other countries
is vital to our interests. We have so far concluded a number of agreements specifically on combating
international terrorism with key partners. These provide frameworks to develop a sense of common purpose,
to share information and to set up practical counter‑terrorism activities. Australia now has such agreements


-----

with Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, Brunei, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, East Timor, India,
Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkey and Bangladesh.

Australia has an enduring strategic interest in our immediate region, and South-East Asia remains of particular
importance to Australia’s counter-terrorism efforts. It is a popular destination for Australians on holiday,
and many Australians live in or have family ties to the region. Australia has significant trade, investment and
diplomatic interests in South-East Asia and an abiding stake in its security. The region has been the site of
previous terrorist attacks against Australians and Australian interests, and we have a clear interest in supporting
a stable and secure immediate neighbourhood.

5.6.2 The Ambassador for Counter-Terrorism

The Australian Ambassador for Counter-Terrorism plays a key role in coordinating international policy
cooperation for counter-terrorism. In recognition of the complexity of the range of Australia’s international
counter-terrorism measures, and to improve policy coherence and effectiveness, the Government has
enhanced the role of the Ambassador for Counter‑Terrorism.

The Ambassador for Counter-Terrorism

The Ambassador for Counter-Terrorism coordinates Australia’s international counter-terrorism efforts by
building international linkages and ensuring that the separate efforts of Australian Government agencies
internationally are consistent, prioritised, well-focused and effective. The Ambassador leads negotiation
of Australia’s counter-terrorism agreements with partner countries, and advises on international
developments to ensure that Australia has access to best international practice.

The Ambassador is a member of the National Counter-Terrorism Committee.

From the 2010–11 Budget, the Ambassador, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, will recommend annually
to the National Security Committee of Cabinet a list of policy priorities for international counter‑terrorism
engagement. This will increase coherence in the delivery of Australia’s international counter-terrorism efforts.
It will also inform the national security priorities which support the National Security Adviser’s consideration
of a coordinated national security budget.

5.6.3 Regional initiatives

Regional security forces have made considerable progress in countering local terrorist groups over recent years.
However, the threat of terrorist attack in our region remains and Australia must continue to support our regional
partners in their efforts to improve and sustain their counter‑terrorism capabilities. Australia’s international
counter-terrorism efforts have been and will continue to be focused mainly in South-East Asia, and our regional
partners and allies expect Australia to make a leading contribution there. We will seek to build on the progress
achieved in South‑East Asia to make an appropriate contribution in other regions.

The Government has set out clearly the direct interests Australia has in countering terrorism in South Asia,
particularly through operations in and assistance to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Australia has a vital stake in
ensuring that there are no safe-havens in South Asia for the terrorist groups that have targeted Australia and
other countries. The Government has committed significant resources – diplomatic, military, law enforcement


-----

and civilian efforts in governance, reconstruction and development – in Afghanistan for this purpose, and we are
continuing to examine ways to work with the Government of Pakistan and other nations to provide assistance
to Pakistan’s counter‑terrorism efforts.

In their 12 November 2009 Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation, the Prime Ministers of Australia and India
committed to strengthening bilateral cooperation on counter-terrorism, including through the Joint Working
Group on Counter-Terrorism.

5.6.4 International law enforcement

Terrorism is a unique crime that requires an effective law enforcement response. The Australian Federal Police
(AFP) works cooperatively with police services in our region to strengthen their counter‑terrorism capabilities,
develop cohesive multilateral law enforcement strategies and maintain collaborative operational relationships.
Areas of focus include investigations, operations, intelligence, forensics, disaster victim identification, surveillance
and response capabilities.

Collaboration between law enforcement agencies internationally provides a vital mechanism to share
information, investigate and prevent terrorist offences and prosecute offenders. The AFP works closely with
regional counterparts, including through Regional Cooperation Teams with the national police services in
Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines, to make a valuable contribution to the success of the regional law
enforcement response to terrorism. The AFP has also actively investigated allegations of terrorism offences
both in Australia and offshore as part of its preventive policing strategy.

The Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation

As a leading international law enforcement agency, the AFP is well placed to assist our partners to
develop a suite of sophisticated law enforcement tools to aid their investigative capacities and to
identify, locate and prosecute those responsible for terrorist offences. Australia and Indonesia have jointly
developed the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation (JCLEC), which is a police training facility
that has trained approximately 5000 regional law enforcement personnel through over 200 programs.

The JCLEC is a successful example of Australia’s cooperation with a regional counterpart to enhance
regional law enforcement capabilities, share information and develop personal and institutional networks
between contributing agencies. The AFP continues to be heavily involved in the development and
delivery of the curriculum and a range of other Australian Government agencies also contribute advice
and expertise on operational and strategic issues, including investment in supporting infrastructure.

Australia is also working with police services from other parts of the world, including Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan
and Africa, to enhance cooperation and develop law enforcement capabilities in the areas of investigations and
forensics. And the AFP also operates an offshore exercise program which strengthens regional preparedness
to respond to major terrorist incidents. Two exercises are conducted annually in countries within the
Asia-Pacific region, and offer participants the opportunity to practise their response arrangements and identify
opportunities for improvement.

Australia will continue to make a valuable contribution to the technical capabilities of regional law enforcement
agencies. The AFP has helped to establish Regional Bomb Data Centres in Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia


-----

and Thailand to strengthen those police services’ forensic capabilities to support bomb blast investigation,
and has also helped to establish a DNA laboratory in Indonesia to enable large scale disaster victim identification
and crime scene and post-blast investigations. Australia also maintains a dedicated rapid deployment
capability within the AFP to enable the deployment of forensic, technical, intelligence and investigative
experts across the region in response to incidents or to undertake contingency planning for major events
affecting Australian interests.

5.6.5 Supporting international legal frameworks

Robust international legal frameworks are an important part of the global response to terrorism and other
security challenges.

Strengthened legal frameworks in our region serve our interests by promoting a stable, peaceful, and
rules‑based region, and thereby supporting a collective response to terrorism. Australia’s regional engagement
on law and justice furthers these objectives and provides the framework for investigating and prosecuting
terrorism and other serious crime, and also underpins much of our broader operational engagement.

The Government’s efforts are aimed at building sound criminal legal infrastructure and governance frameworks,
and contributing to strengthened regional stability and security. Primarily through the Attorney‑General’s
Department, Australia is working with a number of countries to assist them to develop and implement effective
terrorism laws consistent with key international standards. The Government focuses particularly on assisting
regional partners to implement legal frameworks that meet obligations contained in 16 United Nations
counter-terrorism instruments and associated United Nations Security Council Resolutions. The Government
also provides technical legal assistance to countries to develop anti-money laundering and terrorist financing
arrangements, and supports countries in their efforts to confiscate the financial proceeds of terrorism and
other crime.

Australia is also working with a number of partner countries to develop their capacity to investigate, detain
and prosecute the perpetrators of terrorism offences, particularly where evidence or suspects are beyond their
borders. It is important that we assist other countries to develop the legal processes through which they can
bring those responsible for terrorist acts to account. Strengthening laws and legal practice in these countries,
especially in the criminal and law enforcement fields, is crucial to redress this weakness and complements
the capacity building activities of the AFP. Such work could also assist in the conduct of Australian terrorism
investigations and prosecutions by providing or enhancing mutual assistance and extradition arrangements.

5.6.6 Defence engagement

Australia has to be prepared to contribute as necessary to military operations that support international
efforts to uphold global security and a rules-based international order. The Australian Defence Force (ADF)
provides the Government with a sophisticated military capability that can be deployed in response to a range
of contingencies. The 2009 Defence White Paper Defending Australia in the Asia Pacific Century: Force 2030
set out the Government’s vision for an ADF that has the capabilities to protect Australia and its interests.
Where necessary, these capabilities may be used to contribute to international counter-terrorism efforts.

Australia’s counter‑terrorism efforts will continue to be enhanced by Defence engagement and bilateral
cooperation with other countries in our immediate region, particularly in South‑East and South Asia.
Australia has a clear interest in assisting other countries to develop effective counter‑terrorism capabilities and
the ADF works closely with regional partners to provide expert advice and training to regional military forces,
including in areas such as counter‑hijack and hostage recovery; countering improvised explosive devices;


-----

consequence management; and intelligence. Given the important role of defence forces in maintaining national
security, regional defence engagement also focuses on governance and professionalism to strengthen regional
counter‑terrorism structures and institutions.

5.6.7 Afghanistan

Australia’s current commitment to Afghanistan is an important part of international efforts to support the
Government of Afghanistan to deny terrorists safe haven. Most of the major anti-Western terrorist attacks
of recent years, including those with the most direct impact on Australians, were perpetrated by terrorists
who had links to, or had trained in, Afghanistan or neighbouring Pakistan.

Australian agencies, together with our international partners, are working cooperatively with Afghan authorities
through combined military, police and civilian efforts. We are committed to assisting Afghan authorities
to develop their capacity to provide security for the people of Afghanistan. The mentoring of the Afghan
National Army by the ADF and of the Afghan National Police by the AFP, focused on Oruzgan province, is an
investment in Afghanistan’s capacity to secure its own future.

These security efforts are complemented by a range of other activities that aim to strengthen the capacity of
Afghan institutions to provide basic services and increase economic and other opportunities for the Afghan
people. Australia also contributes to international efforts to counter Afghanistan’s narcotics trade.

Australia’s efforts in Afghanistan are complemented by increased engagement with Pakistan, recognising that
our efforts to achieve security and stability in Afghanistan are linked to both countries. The Government has
increased assistance to the Government of Pakistan through police and military training. We are also working
cooperatively to develop ways to improve health, governance and economic opportunities for the Pakistani
people and to increase trade opportunities between Pakistan and Australia.

Through the appointment of a Special Envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Government has reaffirmed
its commitment to ensure that Australia’s approach is coordinated and integrated into international efforts
in Afghanistan and the region.

5.6.8 Improving the control of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear materials

Australia works internationally to combat the threat of terrorists acquiring or using CBRN materials in a terrorist
attack. This includes working in the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism, in addition to our own
practical capacity building work in the region to promote awareness of the risk and strengthen the security
measures around CBRN sources to deter and prevent potential access by terrorists. International partnerships
also enhance our ability to detect and identify CBRN materials in transit, and to determine ways to mitigate the
impacts of attacks using CBRN material.

Customs and Border Protection closely monitors exports to prevent goods of proliferation concern being sent
to illicit weapons programs that could be used for weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The Defence Export
Control Office has responsibility for administering controls on the export of defence and dual-use goods.

Australia continues to work closely with friends and allies to achieve action on nuclear non‑proliferation and
disarmament, including through full and effective implementation of key arms control treaties (such as the
Nuclear Terrorism Convention) and UN Security Council Resolutions that can further strengthen efforts to
combat WMD terrorism. The Government initiated the International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation
and Disarmament (ICNND), co-chaired by Australia and Japan, to re-energise at a high political level the debate
about the need for a nuclear-weapons-free world.

The importance of international efforts to secure nuclear materials is underscored by the Obama
Administration’s intent to host a Global Summit on Nuclear Security in 2010. This Summit will consider
further cooperative efforts to protect nuclear materials against terrorists and proliferators. Australia has long
been supportive of international efforts to secure nuclear materials and in 2009 made a contribution to the
Nuclear Security Fund of the International Atomic Energy Agency to further international efforts to counter
the threat of nuclear and radiological terrorism.

Availability of nuclear and other radioactive materials

A range of factors are coinciding to make the case for nuclear energy more attractive to some countries.
These factors include increased demand for energy, climate change concerns and the need for security
of energy supply. As a result, a number of countries plan to increase or develop their nuclear energy
capacity. There is also an increasing use of radioactive materials for medical, industrial and environmental
applications. The increasing demand for nuclear materials for energy and use of radioactive materials in
civilian applications underlines the importance of ensuring an effective international regime to control
the use, distribution and security of such materials to ensure that they do not end up in the hands
of terrorists.

As Australia’s national authority for the security of nuclear materials, the Australian Safeguards and
Non-Proliferation Office (ASNO) regulates the physical protection of nuclear materials in Australia,
conducts regional outreach and training, and contributes to the development of international nuclear
security guidelines. The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) has been at
the forefront of efforts to strengthen controls over radioactive sources. Regionally, ANSTO conducts
a project for South-East Asian and Pacific countries that aims to enhance and maintain the control
and security of radioactive sources throughout their life-cycle. This project forms part of Australia’s
contribution to the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism.

### 6 Response

Providing an immediate and targeted response to specific terrorist threats

and terrorist attacks should they occur

Australia has a comprehensive national capability to respond to the threat of terrorism through robust legal
frameworks and effective intelligence, security and law enforcement agencies. We need to respond early to
identify threats and prevent attacks. Our federal, state and territory agencies work in cooperation to conduct
counter-terrorism investigations and pursue prosecutions through our courts. Australia’s emergency and crisis
response arrangements draw together both Commonwealth and state and territory capabilities.

The Government has taken steps to further strengthen the legal framework and to improve the manner
in which our law enforcement and security agencies conduct counter-terrorism investigations. At the
same time, the Government has sought to ensure that our laws remain effective and appropriate. And the
Government will keep our laws under review.

6.1 Robust legal frameworks

Terrorism is a heinous crime that is intended to undermine the way governments and communities
function and to subvert normal political processes. The consequences of a terrorist attack are severe.
Accordingly, there are specific offences and legal powers which reflect the seriousness of terrorism‑related
criminal activity.

Australia’s legal framework has an important dual role in helping to prevent terrorism and bringing to justice
those who perpetrate terrorism. Our laws must reflect the serious criminal nature of terrorism and act as a
deterrent to persons contemplating terrorist activity by providing appropriate sanctions and enforcement
mechanisms. Given the potential severity of a terrorist attack, the laws also contain certain limited powers
to assist relevant agencies to prevent terrorist acts. Because of the potentially devastating consequences,
the primary focus of counter-terrorism laws is on preventing a terrorist act taking place.

6.1.1 Australia’s counter-terrorism laws

The states and territories have referred legislative powers to the Commonwealth to allow the creation of a
single set of terrorism offences under the Criminal Code Act 1995 (the Criminal Code). These offences are aimed
at individuals who engage in, train for, prepare, plan, finance or provide support for terrorist acts.

Our legal framework also allows for terrorist organisations to be declared illegal. This means that individuals
who are members or supporters of terrorist organisations proscribed by the Criminal Code or listed in Part 2
of the Criminal Code Regulations 2002, can be charged with a criminal offence. The listing of an organisation
ceases to have effect two years after its commencement, or if the Attorney‑General ceases to be satisfied that
the organisation is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing
of a terrorist act, whichever occurs first. As of February 2010, 18 terrorist organisations are listed under the
Criminal Code. Details of terrorist organisations currently listed under the Criminal Code can be found at the
Government’s national security website (www.nationalsecurity.gov.au).


-----

The Government will maintain a robust legal regime to seek to ensure that our laws can assist in the prevention
of terrorist acts and bring those responsible to justice. This entails a range of specific offences and powers for law
enforcement and security agencies. But it is equally important that in our efforts to combat terrorism we also
protect the rights of all Australians. The Government is pursuing a range of amendments to our legal framework
to improve the effectiveness of our agencies, while concurrently implementing increased oversight mechanisms
for the operation of our laws.

6.1.2 Regular review of our laws

In December 2008, the Government announced its response to four key reviews of Australia’s counter‑terrorism
and national security legislation, including the Australian Law Reform Commission’s review of sedition laws in
Australia (2006); the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security’s (PJCIS) Review of Security and
Counter-Terrorism Legislation (2006); the PJCIS inquiry into the proscription of ‘terrorist organisations’ under the
Criminal Code (2007); and the Clarke Inquiry into the case of Dr Mohamed Haneef (2008). Implementation of the
recommendations will take place in a considered, transparent and consultative manner. An exposure draft of
legislation was released in 2009 and provided an opportunity for public input prior to the proposed introduction
of specific legislation in Parliament.

These changes reflect the Government’s commitment to ensure that amendments to counter‑terrorism
legislation are well considered. These measures give confidence that Australia’s law enforcement and security
agencies have the tools they need to combat terrorism while ensuring the laws and powers are subject to
appropriate safeguards. An additional review of Australia’s counter‑terrorism legislation will be undertaken in
late 2010 as agreed by COAG on 10 February 2006.

The Government will keep these powers under review against any further need to expand them or tailor them to
deal with any changes in the nature of the threat in the future.

6.1.3 Legitimate legal frameworks

The national security legislative framework has been, and continues to be, designed to underpin a nationally
consistent approach to criminalising, preventing and responding to terrorism and other threats to Australia’s
national security. A key aim of the framework is to provide Australian law enforcement and intelligence
agencies with appropriate tools to deter, investigate, apprehend and prosecute perpetrators of terrorism and
other threats to Australia’s national security.

One of the central principles of Australia’s counter-terrorism strategy is to act within legitimate legal frameworks
and to respect the rule of law. Australia’s national security and counter-terrorism framework is robust enough
to adapt to future events and developments, and incorporates review mechanisms to ensure that these laws
remain necessary and effective.

The Government does not condone any unlawful response to terrorism, including the use of torture. Australia is
committed to meeting its human rights obligations, such as those contained in the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment
or Punishment. Australia’s national security and counter‑terrorism laws are consistent with our obligations under
international law. We are committed to the United Nations counter‑terrorism conventions and protocols.


-----

Greater accountability and transparency

The Government is committed to both fighting terrorism and protecting the rights of all Australians.
In recognition of the special nature of our counter‑terrorism and national security legislation,
the Government is implementing a number of measures to provide greater accountability and
transparency, including:

� establishing an Independent National Security Legislation Monitor to regularly review the operation,

effectiveness and implications of our national security legislation and to consider if the laws remain
necessary and contain appropriate safeguards to protect the rights of individuals;

� progressing amendments to the Inspector‑General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986 to allow
inquiries by the Inspector‑General of Intelligence and Security to extend to Commonwealth agencies
that are not members of the Australian Intelligence Community; and

� establishing the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement to oversee the Australian

Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission.

6.2 Effective legal powers for law enforcement and security agencies

Australia’s counter-terrorism legislation provides particular powers for Australia’s law enforcement and security
agencies to deal with the terrorist threat. These powers provide our law enforcement and security agencies
with the tools that seek to prevent terrorist acts and protect the community from terrorism. The need for
these powers is balanced by legislative safeguards to ensure that the powers are used appropriately and in
defined circumstances.

States and territories also maintain their own counter-terrorism legislation, which provides important powers
to police to help prevent and respond to terrorist acts. Following a Council of Australian Governments (COAG)
agreement in 2005, all states and territories have enacted preventative detention and stop, search and
seize powers.

The Criminal Code contains provisions for control orders and preventative detention. Control orders are
protective measures that can restrict a person’s movements and activities. The AFP can apply to a court for a
control order where there are reasonable grounds that this would assist in preventing a terrorist act or where
a person has trained with a listed terrorist organisation. Under the preventative detention regime, the AFP can
take a person into custody and detain them for a period of 48 hours to prevent a terrorist attack occurring, or to
preserve evidence of a recent attack. States and territories have introduced legislation allowing for preventative
detention for up to 14 days.

When investigating a terrorism offence, the AFP can detain an arrested person under special questioning
powers provided in the Crimes Act 1914. These powers allow the AFP to question a person for a maximum
of 24 hours, but provision is made for additional periods of detention where the investigator needs more
time to analyse material sourced from overseas, or where other authorities outside Australia need more time
to collect information that is relevant, or the information needs to be collected from another time zone or
for translation reasons.

The Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 and the Surveillance Devices Act 2004 provide
defined agencies with investigative tools, including the use of surveillance devices and communications
interceptions, to detect, prevent and investigate acts of terrorism. The use of electronic investigation methods
in counter-terrorism is constantly being challenged by developments in the way people communicate,
including the borderless nature of the internet, encryption and the development and convergence of
technology. These laws enable greater cooperation between law enforcement, national security agencies
and relevant industries to ensure electronic information can be obtained to assist counter-terrorism efforts.

Telecommunications interception

The lawful access and interception of telecommunications is a tool of critical importance to Australia’s
national security. Telecommunications interception is one of the most effective, efficient and low risk
counter-terrorism investigative techniques, and can assist in the apprehension and prosecution of those
who perpetrate serious criminal offences, conspire to engage in terrorist acts and otherwise threaten the
security of Australia.

The rate of development and sophistication of communications technology, coupled with growth in
the number of licensed carriers of such information, will continue to pose challenges to our interception
agencies. Our agencies work collaboratively – and with telecommunications carriers – to find solutions
that ensure both our national security interests and the rights of individuals to privacy are protected.
The Government is exploring options to further increase technical collaboration. In February 2010,
the Parliament passed amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979.
These amendments provide certainty for both public and private Australian computer networks and
will help Australians protect their computer networks from criminal and malicious activities.

6.3 A strong and coordinated approach to law enforcement

The national approach to counter-terrorism is based upon strong cooperative, coordinated and consultative
relationships between relevant agencies to investigate terrorism-related matters with a focus on preventive
operations. Australia’s law enforcement and security agencies are committed to best practice. In recent years,
our agencies have successfully disrupted planned terrorist attacks in Australia. We have also learnt lessons
from the application of our counter-terrorism laws and operational investigative procedures. And we remain
alert to the possibility that other criminal activities, including those perpetrated by organised crime groups,
could coalesce with terrorism.

The Government is determined to build on past experience and refine our processes to maintain effective and
robust investigative capabilities founded on cooperative relationships between police, security and intelligence
services nationally. The Government seeks to ensure that our counter-terrorism laws and the investigative
capabilities of Australia’s law enforcement agencies operate in ways that enable the Australian public to
maintain confidence in our counter-terrorism arrangements.

Identity security

Identity crime is an issue that can affect all Australians. The theft of a person’s identity can be used
for crimes ranging from fraud to issues of greater significance for national security. COAG agreed to
develop and implement a National Identity Security Strategy to better protect Australians by enhancing
identification and verification processes and developing other measures to combat identity crime.
The Government has introduced legislation into Parliament including three new identity crime offences,
and new identity management practices, such as biometrics, are also being developed to meet this
challenge. Such measures increase the protection of individuals’ identity and will also facilitate secure
and efficient electronic interactions between government, business and individuals. More information
is available at www.ag.gov.au/identitysecurity.

6.3.1 A comprehensive national response

Terrorism investigations are often highly complex and can involve a range of different government agencies
nationally. Such investigations require close collaboration between federal, state and territory agencies through
the sharing of intelligence and information, and can also involve close liaison with international counterparts.

The AFP, state and territory police services and other government agencies work cooperatively to conduct
coordinated counter-terrorism investigations. These relationships are institutionalised through a Joint
Counter-Terrorism Team (JCTT) mechanism and comprise police officers from the AFP, the relevant state or territory
police service and ASIO. JCTTs conduct terrorism‑related investigations focusing on preventive operations and are
governed by nationally consistent frameworks for the strategic management of counter-terrorism operations.

Close collaboration between our law enforcement and intelligence agencies is also essential to ensure that
counter-terrorism investigations and operations are informed by integrated information from all available sources
and result in successful prosecutions in Australian courts. Although intelligence agencies do not carry out
criminal investigations, their information is increasingly used in support of law enforcement investigations and
terrorism prosecutions, and appropriate agencies have been enhancing their capacity to provide this support.


-----

Complex investigations

Terrorism is a unique crime that can have grave consequences that often outweigh those of other
crime types. Counter‑terrorism investigations are by their very nature complex. They generally involve
investigations into clandestine networks of individuals who are actively seeking to obfuscate their
activities and who may pose an immediate danger to the general public.

Terrorism investigations are often cross-jurisdictional in nature and can also be connected to events or
groups overseas. This requires close consultation between law enforcement and security agencies, and is
particularly complicated when it involves reliance upon international counterparts. Such investigations
are of the highest priority and involve large numbers of police and staff from other agencies.

Investigations generally involve the review of very large amounts of data to determine whether charges
can be laid or to find exculpatory material – this process is further complicated where material is sourced
from overseas. Such data is often fragmentary, encrypted and hidden. These factors combine to make
terrorism investigations unique in scale and complexity.

6.3.2 Learning from experience

In recognition of the complex nature of counter-terrorism investigations and the importance of successful
prosecution of terrorism offences, the AFP commissioned the Street Review: A review of interoperability between
_the AFP and its national security partners (the Street Review) in 2007. The Street Review examined the AFP’s_
national security operations and the effectiveness of interoperability with ASIO, the Commonwealth Director
of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) and state and territory police services. The Street Review found that there had
been substantial improvements in inter‑agency cooperation since 2003, and made recommendations to
further improve the way national security investigations are managed.

In 2008, the Government commissioned the Clarke Inquiry into the case of Dr Mohamed Haneef, to examine
inter alia the arrest, detention, charging, prosecution and release of Dr Haneef, the cancellation of his visa and
the issuing of a criminal justice stay certificate. The Clarke Inquiry made ten recommendations, which are
currently being implemented, to improve the operation of relevant legislation, and to promote cooperation
and information sharing between government departments and agencies in counter‑terrorism matters.

Relevant agencies are implementing the recommendations of both reviews to improve the conduct of
future counter-terrorism investigations. The AFP, ASIO and the CDPP in particular have instigated a variety
of mechanisms, both at the strategic and operational levels, to resolve issues that may emerge during the
course of an investigation. For example, ASIO and the AFP have established a Joint Operations Protocol to
provide for regular and accountable exchanges of information and ongoing consultation regarding operations.
Furthermore, ASIO, the AFP and the CDPP have developed Counter-Terrorism Prosecution Guidelines to
improve consultation and communication in the investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences.

6.4 State and territory counter-terrorism capabilities

In addition to the range of Commonwealth counter-terrorism capabilities discussed elsewhere in this paper,
states and territories maintain an array of counter-terrorism capabilities to help prevent, prepare for,
respond to and recover from a terrorist incident. State and territory police and emergency services have
primary responsibility to provide first response to a terrorism incident, with national coordination and
assistance provided by Commonwealth agencies as required.

There are around 50,000 state and territory police across Australia, and thousands of fire fighters and emergency
services personnel. Many of these personnel are trained in urban search and rescue and dealing with chemical
and biological hazards. And there are many more ambulance officers and paramedics, doctors, nurses and
health professionals in hospitals who are skilled in dealing with mass casualties, trauma and burns.

States and territories have long practised an all-hazards approach to emergency management. The response
to a terrorism incident would involve similar agencies to those involved in responding to other emergencies.
Many of the skills and techniques most likely to be used in response to a terrorism incident are those
routinely employed by state and territory police and emergency service personnel in dealing with other
emergency situations.

Many other state and territory government departments and agencies are involved in counter‑terrorism-related
policy, arrangements, legislation and regulation. Areas of focus include surface transport security, and working
with Commonwealth agencies and industry to prevent (and if necessary contain) terrorism-related threats
involving biological or radiological materials and chemicals of security concern.


-----

Improved crisis coordination

To improve the delivery of our counter-terrorism and wider national security responsibilities,
the Government has integrated our crisis coordination arrangements and mechanisms applicable to
counter‑terrorism and natural disasters. We have integrated the coordination functions delivered by the
Attorney-General’s Department Coordination Centre and the Emergency Management Australia Incident
Management Facility. This consolidated capability provides the Government with all-hazards information
coordination, monitoring and crisis management functions.

The future for national security crisis coordination, of which counter-terrorism is one component,
will be characterised by a comprehensively integrated approach across Government agencies and
connected to state and territory arrangements. This will be demonstrated through the establishment in
2010 of a Parliament House Briefing Room and a National Crisis Coordination Centre to provide holistic,
real‑time support to senior decision makers during a crisis.

6.5 The role of Defence

Defence contributes directly to Australia’s domestic and international counter‑terrorism efforts by supporting
whole-of-government efforts, in accordance with the Defence Act 1903 and the Australian Constitution.
Defence provides support to civil authorities in relation to domestic security and emergency response efforts,
such as border protection and counter‑terrorism. And the Government retains the option of calling upon the
full breadth of Defence capabilities if necessary.

In some cases, Defence capabilities will need to be designed for and dedicated to domestic security and
emergency response tasks where those capabilities are beyond the ability of other Australian government
agencies to develop and maintain efficiently. The most important of the specialised capabilities that Defence
maintains are highly trained and specially equipped forces necessary for a range of complex counter-terrorism
and hostage recovery operations, and CBRN response. These force elements maintain high readiness to ensure
rapid deployment when required.

### 7 Resilience

Building a strong and resilient Australian community to resist the development

of any form of violent extremism and terrorism on the home front

This chapter explains how Australia will counter violent extremism by:

� building on Australia’s history of inclusion, multiculturalism and respect for cultural diversity to maintain

a society that is resilient to the hate‑based and divisive narratives that fuel terrorism;

� working with the Australian community through a cooperative national approach to lessen the appeal

of violent extremism and support alternative pathways for those at risk, and working internationally to
support this.

Australia’s inclusive, multicultural society is one of our strengths. Australia needs to harness this strength in
the face of the divisive narrative of terrorist groups. We have a key interest in not allowing messages of hate to
divide our community. Maintaining a resilient society based on shared freedoms, respect and understanding
of our diversity helps us achieve that.

Australia is a country that recognises, accepts and respects cultural diversity. However, Australia will not tolerate
the propagation of violent extremism and hate under the cloak of that diversity. The Government is committed to
promoting respect, inclusion and a sense of belonging, in ways which address issues impeding social cohesion.

Exclusion or marginalisation of any individual or group of people can affect us all. It can affect a society’s
cohesiveness, economic performance and, as we have seen overseas, the security and stability of the
community as a whole. There are few countries in the world where migrants have achieved the level of
economic, political, social and cultural participation that they have in Australia. But we cannot afford to be
complacent. We know that a small number of Australians hold extreme beliefs and some of these individuals
are or may be committed to supporting or engaging in acts of terrorism.

7.1 A national approach

An effective counter-terrorism strategy requires a combination of appropriate security and law enforcement
responses, and broader strategies to enhance social cohesion and resilience, and lessen the appeal of the
extremist ideologies that fuel terrorism. Since 2001, significant resources have been committed to identifying,
arresting and prosecuting those planning to commit a terrorist attack. We also have robust measures for
responding to, and recovering from, a terrorist incident.

In addition to intelligence and law enforcement approaches to counter-terrorism, other instruments of
government, as well as communities, can contribute to addressing the broader long-term causes of terrorism
and violent extremism, and the conditions in which they thrive. The states and territories are ideally placed
to work with the community to identify, implement and manage local solutions to local problems and to
develop local level resilience. Many policing programs at the state and territory level are aimed at building
social cohesion.

The Commonwealth and the states and territories are working cooperatively to develop a national approach to
countering violent extremism which will form an integral part of Australia’s national counter‑terrorism strategy.


-----

The Government recognises that strong partnerships between all levels of government and communities
are critical to success, and that solutions must be appropriate to local circumstances. Our approach will bring
existing and new efforts together and will identify and address gaps in our response. These activities will
continue to be based on cooperation between communities and government agencies, and will remain
adaptive to specific circumstances.

The primary objective of the national approach to countering violent extremism is to prevent harm to the
community. Our work will encompass measures to support resilience within the community to extremist
messages, the specific engagement of individuals who already hold extremist views, and efforts to maintain
social cohesion and to support at-risk groups and individuals to resist violent extremism.

7.1.1 Informing our understanding

It is also important that the Government consolidate research and experience from both Australia and around
the world. It is crucial that we better understand the factors leading to violent extremism in Australia, and those
factors that build resilience to extremist messages. In doing so, governments can ensure that their work is
evidence-based and appropriate to Australian circumstances.

The radicalisation process

Radicalisation processes are at work in Australian communities, and are common to all forms of
extremism. There is no single pathway to violent extremism, but there are a number of key factors which
can contribute to the radicalisation of individuals. These include:

� real or perceived social and economic circumstances, and perceptions of the relative circumstances

of others;

� individual social needs and psychological needs and reactions;

� identity politics, including the search for individual identity among sometimes apparently conflicting

cultural reference points;

� identification with, and adoption of, particular ideologies and belief systems that are hostile to liberal

democratic norms and values;

� the dynamics of small groups, including those that form around charismatic figures, often separated

from the mainstream of their community and broader society; and

� the broader political environment, including reactions to overseas events and government responses

to those events, and grievances with local, national and international affairs.


-----

7.1.2 The role of individuals and communities

Extremists often exploit adverse political, social and economic conditions to recruit and motivate others.
Therefore, all Australians have a role to play in promoting and protecting strong, resilient communities that resist
and reject violent extremism. While the overwhelming majority of people in Australia reject violent extremism,
they may not have the tools and information to challenge it.

A number of social policies are already in place, across all levels of government, aimed at building trust, respect
and community harmony. These social policies are rightly pursued for their own broader objectives, but
they can play an important secondary role in addressing the grievances that stem from barriers to social and
economic participation.

As with many other social issues, the families and friends of those vulnerable to violent extremism are often
best placed to recognise changes in behaviour or attitude. However, they may not be as well equipped to
identify why those changes are happening, or to effectively guide those friends and family members away
from extremist influences. Community awareness is improving and families, communities and religious leaders
have always played a crucial role in supporting resilience to extremism. Australian governments will work with
communities to:

� provide information on our counter-terrorism efforts and basic facts about domestic initiatives

and foreign policy;

� seek to address grievances that could encourage a receptiveness to violent extremism; and

� provide opportunities for people at risk of violent extremism to actively participate in Australia’s economy,

society and democratic processes.

Individuals and communities also need to work with authorities to mitigate inter‑communal conflict and
lessen the appeal of violent extremism. Our law enforcement and security agencies seek in various ways to
engage constructively with all sections of Australian society to understand better the issues that can lead to
marginalisation and division within the community. The AFP, state and territory police, and Australian security
agencies recognise the Australian community as their critical partner in protecting Australia from terrorism,
and a valuable source of information regarding terrorist-related activity. These community engagement
programs, and those of other Commonwealth agencies, all aim to build social cohesion, harmony and security.

In a world characterised by the increasing movement of people, and transnational economic, political and
personal connections, social cohesion is an essential component of the stability and welfare of an Australian
society that is resilient to violent extremism. This will require the continuation of government policies that help
to build trust, respect and a sense of belonging within Australian society and serve to undermine the appeal of
violent extremism.

7.2 Working internationally

Australia’s broader approach to national security acknowledges the contribution of our international
development assistance program, managed by AusAID. Although distinct from terrorism‑specific initiatives,
our development assistance program provides possible alternatives and economic opportunity to ‘at risk’
communities and hope for a more optimistic future. The development assistance program helps prevent
instability and insecurity borne of poverty and injustice, particularly in fragile states, and can help to mitigate
the sources of transnational threats such as terrorism. Sustainable development, particularly within our region
and in high risk environments, is in Australia’s long-term strategic interests.


-----

The development assistance program is working in direct support of whole-of-government efforts in high risk
environments such as Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq, where terrorism presents significant security challenges.
The long-term fight against international terrorism requires increased attention to prevention and local support.
Broad-based and inclusive engagement with a wide range of partners, including communities, business and
faith-based groups, forms an integral part of promoting social cohesion and community resilience.

While there is no proven causal link between social disadvantage and terrorist behaviour, social and economic
hardship can lead individuals, families and even communities to be more receptive to extremist ideologies that
might promise more attractive alternatives or seek to explain such hardships as injustice imposed by external
actors. Protecting and assisting the poorest, most vulnerable and most marginalised populations can help
address local sources of grievance, frustration and disenfranchisement that terrorists try to exploit. Improved
access to health, vocationally relevant education and employment opportunities can create conditions less
conducive to extremist views and propaganda.

### 8 Conclusion

Terrorism has become a persistent and permanent feature of Australia’s security environment. The Government’s
responsibility is to task intelligence, security and law enforcement agencies to direct their counter-terrorism
efforts to analyse the threat, to seek to protect Australia and Australians, to be ready to respond to threats and
attacks when needed, and to make efforts to strengthen resilience in our community and society.

Government efforts on counter-terrorism increased after the attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001.
There has been bipartisan support for strong counter-terrorism policies and this remains the case.

Since 2007 the Government has reformed the national security apparatus to focus agencies on working
in unison for the country’s security.

Most recently, the Government has announced a $200 million package of aviation security measures to better
protect our air transport system from terrorist attack. In this White Paper, there are new measures including the
investment of $69 million to introduce biometric-based visa systems to reduce the risk of terrorists, criminals
and other persons of concern entering Australia undetected. A new Counter-Terrorism Control Centre will be
established that will improve the ability of agencies to operate against terrorism and to detect and prevent
terrorist threats.

To build greater depth in national security expertise in Australia for the long term, the Government has
announced the establishment of the National Security College to provide world class education and training
in national security policy. A joint venture between the Australian Government and the Australian National
University (ANU), the College will provide executive development programs for senior national security officials
and provide access to ANU teaching and research programs, with the aim of better preparing national security
personnel for the increasingly complex challenges they face.

The Government remains committed to efforts that enhance the integration and coordination of Australia’s
national security systems. We will continue to manage the range of security challenges we confront in a flexible
and adaptive way. This approach serves our objective to take all necessary and practical measures to protect
Australia and Australians at home and abroad.
