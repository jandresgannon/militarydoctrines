PREFACE

This White Paper, Defending Australia explains how the Government will manage
Australia's defence into the next century. It is the most comprehensive review and
restatement of the Government's defence policy since the publication of _The Defence_
_ofAustralia, 1987, which established a clear and rigorous analytical basis for defence_

engaging with our region.

This White Paper explains how the Government's defence policy can and will
respond to these changes. While the fundamental precepts of self-reliance remain
valid, the approaches we take to developing and sustaining our defence capabilities
and strategic relationships will need to continue to evolve. Defending Australia
builds on important changes to our defence policies announced in a number of
statements and reviews published over the last four years, including the 1990 _Report_
_on the Defence Force and the Community, the 1991 Force Structure Review, the_
_1992 Price Report on Defence Policy and Industry and the 1993 Strategic Review._
From that foundation, it looks ahead fifteen years to describe the key international
trends that will shape our strategic environment, and to explain how the different
elements of our defence policy will develop to meet the challenges ahead.

Our strategic circumstances at present are not threatening, but they are likely to
become more demanding over the next fifteen years. Our defence capabilities will
be developed so we can continue to be able to deter or defeat any credible armed
attack, and our regional defence relationships and alliances will evolve to limit the
possibility that armed attack on Australia might even be contemplated. As Australia's
industrial and technological capabilities develop, and the demands on our defence
capabilities increase, we will rely increasingly on our own national support base to
underpin our defence. As our population and social structures change, the Australian
Defence Force will change the way we employ people to conform to new social,
economic and military realities.

The decisions we make on these issues over the next few years will determine the `100*E` `RUSSIA`
shape of Australia's defence well into the next century because major defence
capabilities and strategic relationships take decades to develop. That is why this
White Paper looks ahead fifteen years. It aims to explain to all Australians how
their defence is planned and managed, and how it will develop in the years ahead.
It will also help to inform other countries, including our regional neighbours, about `CHINA`
the rationale of our defence posture, and so ensure there is no scope for
misunderstanding. The publication of this White Paper is thus itself a contribution `AIWAN`
to our future security. 2ON ,-/ n `ktMIANA` **\20N**

APPENDIX: The Australian Defence Organisation Today .................. 161


-----

1.1 The Government has a fundamental responsibility to ensure Australia's
defence. It meets this responsibility by ensuring that we can prevent or defeat the
use of armed force against us. To do that we maintain defence forces and pursue
national policies which support defence efforts, sustain favourable regional and
alliance relationships and contribute to global security arrangements.

1.2 Maintaining a defence force capable of ensuring that armed force is not
successfully used against Australia is essential because armed force remains a factor
in international affairs. It continues to be one of the ways in which national power
can be asserted and national self interest pursued. The end of the Cold War has
reduced global threats, but at other levels the use of military force has not diminished
and indeed may become more common. As the constraints imposed by the Cold
War are lifted, and the economic and technical means to acquire military power
become more widespread, so the use of that power to attain national objectives and
international influence may grow.

1.3 Alliances, regional links and global security arrangements enhance our
security environment by making attacks on Australia less likely and increasing the
prospect of support from others. They also contribute to efforts to minimise the
role of armed force in international affairs and establish credible, rules-based regimes
for conflict resolution. Effective military capability is essential to our defence,
however, because armed force can only be resisted ultimately by armed force. In
Australia's case, the force on which we rely must be our own because our security
environment and national interests are unique.

1.4 Australia's future security - like our economic prosperity - is linked
inextricably to the security and prosperity of Asia and the Pacific. Australia's
strategic engagement with the region is an integral element of our national effort to
make our place in the region. Our defence relationships underpin the development
of closer links in other fields. Our ability to defend ourselves and contribute to
regional security does much to ensure that we are respected and helps us engage in
the region by giving confidence that we can manage uncertainty and assure our
security.

integral part of our defence capability. This capacity must be nurtured carefully in
peace. Also underlying the technology and skills of our Defence Force are the
distinctive human qualities which are still integral to the profession of arms. Modem
war still demands the age-old qualities of dedication and discipline, courage and
comradeship. These qualities are inculcated by the Australian Defence Force,
building over generations on the esprit of our fighting forces. If the men and
women of the Australian Defence Force are to serve us well in war, we must continue
to nurture them in peace.

1.9 Moreover, by developing and maintaining the capabilities of the Australian
Defence Force in peace, we are not just preparing to resist aggression. We are
helping to make war less likely. We are less likely to be subject to armed attack
because our Defence Force clearly is capable of defeating any credible use of force
against us. By sustaining forces which can effectively resist aggression, we help to
prevent it.

2.1 For most of the last fifty years, the strongest threat to Australia's security
was the possibility of global war between the superpowers. That threat has now
faded. Australia's national interests, including our economic interests, could still
be affected very seriously by events in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere. As
long as the threat of global war remains low, however, the likelihood of armed
attack on Australia will depend on strategic developments in Asia and the Pacific,
and particularly in Asia itself.

2.2 The region is now comparatively peaceful. The Korean Peninsula and
South Asia remain areas of international tension and potential conflict; in the South
China Sea, well-armed nations have competing territorial claims; in some countries,
including Cambodia, the authority of sovereign governments is challenged severely;
and elsewhere political repression holds back economic and social development.
Generally, however, the stable pattern of strategic relationships in Asia and the
Pacific over the last twenty years has enabled economies to grow and more effective
governments to evolve, while the end of the Cold War has allowed many of the
tensions and conflicts of the past to be resolved or eased.

2.3 Yet the relative peace in Asia may not last. The pattern of stable strategic
relationships which has underpinned Asia's security in recent years is changing.
The two major influences are the shifting relationships between the major regional
powers, and economic and political change throughout Asia.

THE MAJOR POWERS

2.4 During the Cold War, the two superpowers and their relationships with
China and Japan dominated strategic affairs in Asia and the Pacific. The United
States and the Soviet Union had vital interests throughout the region, and the military
capabilities to protect those interests. The uneasy bipolar balance constrained
significant shifts in the strategic relationships between other countries in the region.
Maintaining this balance was demanding, but it did produce a measure of stability
throughout the region. Now some of the constraints are being loosened following
the end of the Cold War.

2.17 The effects of these economic and military developments on the security
of the region clearly will depend on political events in key countries. Significant
evolution of Japan's political system seems likely. China's system of government
is under pressure as it moves to become a modern industrial state undergoing huge
economic and social change. Korea may well be unified, introducing a substantial
new strategic element. The relationship between China and Taiwan is likely to
evolve in response to political change in both, but in a direction that is not easy to
foretell. Vietnam will face major challenges to adapt its political system to the
demands of the modern world, and how it does that will determine whether its
potential is realised. Indonesia will undergo an important leadership transition at a
time of rapid economic growth and social change.

NEW CHALLENGES TO OUR DEFENCE POLICY

2.18 The long-term trends in regional security affairs we have identified will
develop slowly, but are likely over the next fifteen years to affect our strategic
circumstances significantly. They will have important and direct consequences
for the development of Australia's defence policy.

2.19 First, the end of the Cold War means the passing of the structures which
have shaped the regional strategic environment. Previously, our defence planning
has been able to assume a degree of predictability in our strategic circumstances.


-----

3.1 The global and regional changes which are making our strategic outlook
more demanding are also producing new patterns of relationships. One of the
Government's major objectives is to establish Australia's place in these emerging
patterns and to shape them to meet Australian interests. Australia's security as
well as its prosperity in the decades ahead will depend on how well we do that.
This requires an integrated approach across the range of foreign, defence, trade,
immigration and other international policies, as well as domestic policies on
economic, industrial, social and environmental issues.

3.2 The Government's defence policy contributes to this integrated national
effort in two related ways - by ensuring that we are able to defend Australia from
armed attack, and by sustaining our alliances and contributing to a global and
regional environment in which attack on Australia is less likely. These are the key
elements of our defence policy.

CAPABILITIES FOR THE DEFENCE OF AUSTRALIA

3.3 The foundation of the Government's defence policy is self-reliance, which
requires that Australia maintain the military capabilities to defend our country
without depending on help from other countries' combat forces. This approach to
defence reflects our view of ourselves. Self-reliance in defence is essential to the
Government's broader conception of Australia as a nation, proud of our continent
and our achievements, and committed to preserving them.

3.4 Defence self-reliance also reflects strategic realities. Australia's security
is not so vital to other nations that we can assume others would commit substantial
forces to our defence. This will become increasingly so as our strategic environment
becomes more complex. Our alliance with the United States does not mean we
can expect it to provide for our defence. Indeed, that alliance obliges us to provide
effectively for our own defence. Regional cooperation will be important in
promoting a more secure environment, but it will not evolve into a collective defence
arrangement which could subsume the defence of Australia into a wider regional
defence organisation. Nor could we expect the United Nations to defend Australia.
So defence self-reliance remains essential for us.

circumstances of the future. This will be important not just to our security, but to
our national independence, international standing and self-respect. 3.9 In developing capabilities for the defence of Australia, we seek forces

which provide a range of cost-effective options. Our objective would be a cessation
of hostilities as rapidly and conclusively as practicable, consistent with protecting
the range of national interests involved. These would include preserving our
territorial integrity and economic interests, protecting Australian lives and property,
maintaining our international standing, and avoiding unnecessary risks to the
personnel and platforms of the Australian Defence Force.

3.10 A key feature of our defence is the need for our forces to be supported as
much as practicable by Australia's wider resources. We seek to draw on the full
range of skills and capabilities within the Australian community. This is necessary
to ensure not only an adequate number of suitable personnel, but also effective
support for our forces in times of conflict.

3.11 Planning for the defence of Australia takes full account of our broader
strategic interests. Australia has important interests beyond the defence of our
own territory, and the Australian Defence Force will be called upon in the future,
as it has been in the past, to undertake activities and operations elsewhere in our
region, and in other parts of the world, in cooperation with neighbours, allies and
international institutions, particularly the United Nations. Recent deployments in
the Gulf, Namibia, Cambodia, Somalia, Rwanda, the South Pacific and elsewhere,
as well as our continual defence deployments around the region, have demonstrated

PLANNING THE DEFENCE OF AUSTRALIA

4.1 Careful planning for the defence of Australia ensures that we have the
level and mix of capabilities necessary for defence self-reliance. The posture and
forces we require are determined by our strategic geography and by the nature and
level of capabilities which could credibly be used against us. This approach provides
a rigorous, enduring basis for disciplined planning, even as our strategic
circumstances become more demanding.

Strategic Geography

4.2 Our strategic geography is central in planning our defence posture and
capabilities. Australia's location, size, population and infrastructure provide both
advantages and challenges for our defence. As an island continent, the primary
focus of our defence effort is on our sea and air approaches, which can be turned to
our decisive advantage. An adversary attacking Australia would have to project
and sustain forces across our sea and air approaches where hostile ships and aircraft
are relatively easy to detect and attack, and will become increasingly so as
technologies develop. We can therefore make it difficult for an adversary to mount
or sustain an attack on our territory by denying our sea and air approaches to hostile
ships and aircraft.

4.3 Australia could be most easily attacked in the north, where our sea and
air approaches are shortest, so we need to pay particular attention to defending that
area by being able to undertake operations in our northern approaches and across
northern Australia. While our sparsely populated north provides great strategic
depth, an adversary may seek to exploit the vast distances and dispersed population
to mount small attacks at isolated locations. Those challenges mean that our forces
must be highly mobile to allow rapid deployment into areas of contention and to
conduct dispersed operations over wide areas. They must also be familiar with the
difficult operating environment to gain advantage over a less well acclimatised
adversary.

4.4 Our defence planning is also shaped by our human geography. We have
a relatively small population but a strong education, technology and industry base.
Our defence approach therefore gives priority to capabilities which rely on high

technology rather than on large numbers ofpersonnel. That fits well with the priority,

forces which are technology intensive.

In Australia's circumstances, significant changes in policy and attitude toward us,
quite contrary to present trends, would be needed for any threat to emerge. We
have a responsible approach to regional and wider international relationships and
we maintain an evidently strong defence capacity; these help make such a change
unlikely and help to ensure that we could expect clear and early indications of any
changes.

us would need to contend with the coordinated and efficient action of all our forces
under joint operational command.

4.29 At the national level, the depth in our defences derives from our ability
to draw on a wide range of national resources to provide the greatest practicable
opposition to any adversary. That requires integrating a range of civil assets and
capabilities into our defence effort. Such integration includes collaboration with
Australian industry to supply, repair and modify equipment and to provide through-
life support; increasing reliance on the broader national infrastructure for transport
and telecommunications; an extensive shift to commercial support for Defence
activities in areas as diverse as aircraft maintenance and catering; and cooperation
with Coastwatch and the people of northern Australia to ensure warning of hostile
movements in a conflict. Our ability to draw on our wider national resources as
part of our defence effort will become increasingly important as our strategic
circumstances become more demanding. It enables us to sustain our relative
capabilities more efficiently, and provides a wider base of expertise to draw on for
developing and supporting high-technology systems. More broadly, the closer
integration of Defence and the civil community strengthens Defence by making
the Services more appealing employers, and provides important benefits to the
community as well.

4.30 The result of effectively integrating our geographical and technological
advantages, our knowing the region and having a wider national support base is
that at no stage would an adversary be able to assume freedom of deployment or
action. Caution would be necessary at all stages. Any adversary would be presented
with a comprehensive array of capabilities, employed in a measured way for
offensive and defensive operations.

Force Development Priorities

_4.50 Our present defence capabilities, and the substantial developments we_
have underway, provide a strong foundation for building the Defence Force over
the next fifteen years and beyond to meet the needs of our defence posture. We
have, and are developing, strong and expanding intelligence capabilities and
enduring intelligence relationships with friends and allies; modem surveillance
assets, including the unique capability of the Jindalee Operational Radar Network;
potent capabilities for patrolling and guarding our sea and air approaches and for
longer range strike operations, including F 111 and F/A- 18 aircraft, guided missile
and ANZAC frigates, and the Collins class submarines; and flexible and mobile
land forces increasingly based in northern Australia and well equipped for operations
there. Our task in coming years is to develop these capabilities further to continue
to ensure that we can defeat forces which could credibly be brought to bear against
us. In doing that, we will give priority to:

developing the Australian Defence Force as an integrated whole, including
command arrangements and doctrine at the operational level;

carefully identifying areas and capabilities in which we need to maintain
a high degree of excellence, in particular, command, control and
communications; and which effectively use our strategic geography, in
particular, maritime and air capabilities;

cultivating our ability to expand and enhance our forces in response to
significant new capabilities which might be brought to bear against us;
and

strengthening our national support base for defence.

5.1 The Australian Defence Organisation today possesses a wide range of
substantial capabilities, as set out in Appendix A. The combat capabilities, and
most combat support capabilities, reside in the Australian Defence Force, although
some - notably, intelligence collection and evaluation and significant support
capabilities - reside predominantly in the civilian elements of the Defence
Organisation. The capability developments proposed in this Chapter will ensure
we can meet defence needs as our strategic environment becomes more demanding
over the next fifteen years and beyond.

_5.2 [Many platforms and assets can contribute to more than one of the key]_
defence roles, either at different times or simultaneously. Thus they contribute
very broadly to the Australian Defence Force's capacity to defend Australia. In
this Chapter, assets are treated under the role or roles to which they make the major
contribution, rather than considering in detail the full breadth of the contribution
they could make to other roles.

COMMAND, CONTROL AND COMMUNICATIONS

5.3 Effective command and control of Australia's forces is fundamental to
success in any conflict, just as it is to the efficient management of force elements
participating in peacetime activities.

_5.4 [The revolution in information technology is changing the ways in which]_
armed forces are commanded and controlled, allowing much more efficient use of
military capabilities and better coordination of activity at all levels. These
developments will continue over coming years. The successful exploitation of

defence because it will allow us to use our ships, aircraft and land forces to maximum
effect.

SURVEILLANCE OF MARITIME AREAS AND NORTHERN
AUSTRALIA

5.15 The ability to locate and monitor potentially hostile forces in our sea and
air approaches and on our territory is essential to prevent or nullify threats to our
interests. The Australian Defence Force possesses significant capabilities to detect
and monitor aircraft, ships and submarines in the sea and air approaches to our
territory. The capability to detect and monitor any forces which may have lodged
on our territory is more limited. The capability for wide area surveillance will
continue to be improved over the coming decade with the introduction of new high
technology systems.

_5.16 The Jindalee Operational Radar Network will be completed to provide_
broad area surveillance coverage of ships and aircraft in Australia's sea and air
approaches. Ground based microwave radars, surface combatants with a range of
active and passive sensors, including naval helicopters, and maritime patrol aircraft
such as the P3C Orion, all contribute to surface and air surveillance. While our
detection capabilities are good, localisation of detected air targets needs further
attention. Towed acoustic arrays are being fitted to the Collins Class submarines
to provide a further capacity for detecting ships and submarines, and similar arrays
will be fitted later to surface ships. Maritime patrol aircraft and naval helicopters
carry sonobuoys which can detect submarines within localised areas. The feasibility 5.18 Further development of Australia's capacity for surveillance will focus

6.1 The Australian Defence Force's tradition of military excellence is based
on the professionalism and competence of its people, both at home and abroad.
Recent deployments in the Gulf War, Namibia, Cambodia, Somalia, Rwanda and
elsewhere have reinforced this.

6.2 In the face of a wide range of social, demographic, technological,
industrial, cultural and legal changes in Australia, recruiting and retaining people
with the skills, professionalism and discipline required by the Australian Defence
Force is and will be challenging. Our response to these challenges covers a broad
front. Existing initiatives include improved housing, family support programs,
reviews by the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal, national accreditation of
military training and early determination of deployment allowances.

6.3 People are fundamental to all our defence capabilities. For the Defence
Organisation to respond to more demanding strategic circumstances, personnel
policies are directed at ensuring maximum return from uniformed personnel and
welding all personnel, military and civilian, full-time and part-time, into a single
team, Defence's one organisation. Fair and reasonable pay and conditions will be
maintained for all staff, and the special features of military service will be recognised.
High quality, cost-effective training will continue to be provided to enhance staff
development and practice. Personnel management will be based on merit and
equal employment opportunity, and demand exemplary standards of performance
and conduct.

THE SPECIAL NATURE OF MILITARY SERVICE

6.4 Defence Force service imposes special demands and impacts on families.
Australian Defence Force personnel often work under arduous physical conditions
for extended periods. Both on and off duty, they are subject to strict disciplinary
requirements, backed by the punishment provisions of the Defence Force
Disciplinary Act. They must render service as ordered, and the opportunity to take
into account personal preference or convenience is less than might be found in
most other forms of employment. They must also maintain high standards of health
and physical fitness so that they can withstand the physical and mental stresses
associated with armed conflict, and are subject to compulsory early retirement
well before the age of sixty five.

elements of the Total Force.

responsibilities as they progress in rank.

6.30 The Australian Defence Force must face the prospect of high separation
rates. Many young Australians will not remain with the one employer throughout
their working lives; increasingly, they see changing employment as broadening
their knowledge, experience and opportunities. Although in some career streams
Australian Defence Force employment offers variation, change and the chance to
develop multiple skills, in other cases such opportunities are limited. Thus, many

# L1 Defence Force personnel will seek other employment after about six years' service,

and few may serve beyond fifteen years. The attractiveness of service in the Defence
Force increasingly will be affected by the short-term expectations of individual
members.

6.31 In these conditions, the Defence Organisation must ensure the talents of
all its people are best used. Employment and advancement therefore will continue
to be determined strictly on the basis of the ability of individuals to perform the
work required.

7.1 Reserves have always been an important part ofAustralia's defence. They
have a long and proud tradition of service to the community in peace and war, and
they link the Australian Defence Force and the wider Australian community. Today.
Reserves represent over a third of the total personnel strength of the Australian
Defence Force and as functions are redistributed this proportion will grow. Reserve
elements no longer exist solely to assist rapid expansion of the permanent forces
during mobilisation for war. Instead, Reserves now have specific roles in defending
Australia in short-warning conflict, both as individuals and as formed units. In
peace, they perform a number of essential tasks on a permanent part-time basis.
They are, therefore, a fundamental part of the Total Force.

7.2 Recent legislation facilitates this new role for Reserves. Call-out is now
possible in circumstances short of a declared defence emergency. To prepare
Reserves for this increased responsibility, the structure of the Reserve component
and their training and equipment will be improved.

7.3 Such arrangements are constrained in peace by what can be demanded of
citizens who volunteer to defend Australia when needed. Part-time military service
competes with civilian employment, family life and other interests. Nevertheless,
training systems which make reasonable demands on time, and enable Reserves to
be at the standard required for the tasks allocated to them, can and will be put in
place. Furthermore, appropriate conditions of service will protect the interests of
Reserve members and encourage more Australians to see service in the Reserve as
worthwhile and rewarding.

RESERVES IN THE TOTAL FORCE

7.4 Australian Defence Force Reserves are part of a continuum of Defence
personnel. This continuum, with commensurate conditions of service, extends
from Regular or full-time members, through active Reserves with training
commitments, to inactive Reserves with no training obligations. The Ready Reserve
Scheme, introduced after the review of **The Defence Force and the Community**
in 1990 and the Force Structure Review [in 1991, involves one year of concentrated]
full-time training followed by a minimum of 50 days training in each subsequent
year.

training. Then, the distinction between Regulars and Reserves will relate to their
level of military experience and availability. Common standards will enable the
effective integration of Regular and Reserve elements. As much as possible,
individual training for Reserves will be to the same standard as for Regular members,
with employment determining the scope of training. Some resource allocations
will be adjusted to ensure Reserves are able to undertake the tasks required of
them. In particular, greater flexibility will be provided in the use of training
resources.

7.27 In peace, part-time Reserve service generally precludes lengthy periods
of continuous military training. Therefore it is not possible for Reserves to be
proficient in the full range of military skills involved in modern warfare, especially
those requiring large-scale collective training. Formed Reserve units carry out
limited collective training in peace, but would require additional collective training
after call-out to achieve full operational capabilities.

7.28 The twelve months of full-time training provided to Ready Reserves gives
them a sound base of individual and collective skills. They then develop operational
skills by further specialist and collective training. This relatively intensive training
and exercising enables them to be ready for deployment at shorter notice than most
other Reserves.

### PART III

**International**
**Defence Interests**


-----

8.1 Over the next fifteen years, the strategic environment in Asia and the
Pacific is likely to be more demanding and to be determined, more than ever, by
the policies and approaches of regional countries themselves. In these
circumstances, Australia's engagement with regional countries as a partner in
determining the strategic affairs of the region will be an increasingly important
element in ensuring our security. We will develop our dialogue on strategic and
defence issues with key countries of the region, and will aim to promote an
environment which sustains a stable pattern of strategic relationships and avoids
destabilising strategic competition.

8.2 The activities which we pursue with regional countries with these broad
interests in mind will include bilateral programs aimed at cooperation in developing
defence capabilities and professional standards appropriate to the legitimate defence
needs of the countries concerned. We will continue to foster, through dialogue, an
accurate understanding of Australia's strategic interests and security concerns and
ensure that we in turn understand the perceptions, concerns and capabilities of
neighbouring countries. This will reflect Australia's commitment, shared
increasingly by our neighbours, to transparency in defence policy development
and force planning. At the multilateral level, we will maintain our firm commitment
to the Five Power Defence Arrangements. We will participate actively in processes
which foster a sense of shared strategic interests and will encourage the continued
evolution of cooperative security approaches in the region. We aim to ensure that
these processes are inclusive and provide scope for the major powers of Asia and
the Pacific to engage constructively with each other and with other countries of the
region.

8.3 In the defence relationships we promote through these approaches, we
will identify opportunities for defence materiel exports and for defence industry
collaboration. This will help develop and support Australia's defence industry
base, broaden our defence cooperation with regional countries and contribute to
Australia's export and overseas investment performance.

8.4 Australia has maintained strong defence relationships since the Second
World War with particular countries in Asia and the Pacific, especially the countries
of ASEAN and the South-West Pacific. The scope, content and quality of our
activities with these countries, particularly those in South-East Asia, will change
substantially over the next fifteen years to reflect relationships based more on
partnership and shared interests. As we train and exercise together, our relationships
will develop new dimensions and depth, including new levels of strategic dialogue

8.21 Our bilateral defence relationships with Malaysia and Singapore both
are developing in important new directions. Our wide range of cooperative activities
with Singapore is being supplemented by the development of substantial
Singaporean training and exercising activities in Australia, mostly on a fee-for-

conduct activities which it cannot readily undertake in its own constrained territory.
These activities reflect the strong sense of trust between Australia and Singapore,
and serve our strategic interests by helping to enhance Singapore's defence
capabilities. Singapore's armed forces are making substantial investments in the
construction of facilities in Australia, and providing valuable opportunities for
Australian companies to support their activities.

THE UNITED STATES ALLIANCE

9.1 Australia's defence alliance with the United States continues to be a key
element of our defence policy, and will remain so over the period covered by this
White Paper. The relationship formalised in the ANZUS Treaty reflects the close
alignment of our enduring strategic interests. During the Cold War, activities under
the alliance were shaped largely by our membership of the Western strategic
community, which supported the ability of the United States to maintain a global
strategic balance with the Soviet Union. The relationship, however, is founded on
our shared interests in a stable and secure Asia-Pacific region and values and
traditions which pre-date the Cold War and will endure long after it.

9.2 Throughout the period covered by this White Paper the United States
will remain the strongest military power in the world with the most sophisticated
military technology; it will be a key influence on the security ofAsia and the Pacific
and it will have a central place in any multilateral security arrangements which
emerge and in the negotiation and implementation of arms control and disarmament
measures.

9.3 The alliance will continue to serve the interests of both countries. The
United States will benefit from Australia's support: we are closely engaged in
regional affairs and sympathetic to most American values and interests. More
broadly, the alliance strongly supports the United States' continued strategic
presence in the Western Pacific, which is of major strategic interest both for the
United States and for Australia, and for others in the region.

9.4 The major trends shaping our strategic environment will affect the alliance.
The United States will retain important interests in ou?region and strong forces to
protect those interests. Yet the nature and perception of American interests and the
capabilities of US forces will change. American expectations of the alliance will
change with them, as the previous emphasis on alliance cohesion against the Soviet
Bloc is replaced by a more complex and evolving US posture. Equally, Australia's
requirements of the alliance will change as we develop our capabilities further, and
become even more active in regional strategic affairs. Increasingly, as we seek
security in and with Asia, we will value our alliance with the United States not just
for the contribution it makes to Australia's own defence, but also for its broader
contribution to regional security.

11.1 An effective partnership between the Defence Organisation and Australian
industry is essential to Australia's defence. The Government's defence policies for
industry outlined in this Chapter will enhance Australia's capacity for defence and
are consistent with those policies announced in the recent White Paper on
Employment and Growth for the development of a strong national industrial base.
Substantial contributions and commitment from both the Defence Organisation
and Australian industry will he required to ensure an effective partnership for defence
self-reliance into the future.

AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY

11.2 A strong Australian defence industry is important in sustaining the
operational effectiveness of the Australian Defence Force, and ensuring that the
Force is able to adapt to changing circumstances. Industry's contribution to our
defence effort will become more important as our strategic environment becomes
more demanding. Australia's defence industry capacity is supplemented by New
Zealand's. Under the terms of the ANZAC Ship Treaty and in accord with closer
economic and defence relations, New Zealand industry together with Australian
industry are considered as a single defence industrial base. Australian and New
Zealand firms are therefore treated equally in our Defence industry policies, except
in regard to a small number of high-security or third country collaborative projects.

11.3 The capacity of Australian industry has changed significantly since the
mid-1980s. Defence-related industries have benefited from measures the
Government has taken to improve the international competitiveness of Australian
industry generally. These have included lower tariff barriers, a more internationally
competitive tax structure, deregulated transport and communications sectors,
improved industrial relations, reinvigorated public sector research and development,
and active pursuit of new export markets.

11.4 Defence policy for industry has furthered this process by encouraging
efficient production and work practices and export-oriented Australian
manufacturing and services. Major projects, such as the Collins Class submarines
and ANZAC frigates, have transferred new technologies to Australia and enhanced
important skills, including managing complex engineering development projects,
systems integration and software engineering. Other projects, such as the Jindalee
Operational Radar Network, have developed new technologies indigenous to

preference for the provision of exclusive rights to industry, much less emphasis on
short-term revenue raising, and an expansion of the use of royalty arrangements. 11.36 The Government supports and encourages the export of defence products

from Australia, within carefully enforced guidelines. These guidelines ensure that
such exports are consistent with our wider national interests and obligations.
Countries have the right to self-defence, and hence to buy and sell defence
equipment. Australia itself is a substantial importer of defence equipment, and
recognises that other countries have similar rights to purchase defence equipment
for legitimate purposes.

11.37 The development of Australian materiel cooperation projects and defence
exports offers significant benefits to Australia. Apart from the direct commercial
benefits to industry and the wider economy, defence exports support Australia's
strategic interests. They enhance the capability of Australian defence industry,
thereby increasing the support available within Australia to the Defence
Organisation. They also provide a valuable basis for enhancing our defence
relationships with countries in the region as well as our traditional partners.

11.38 The Government strictly controls the export of defence and defence-
related goods to ensure that our foreign policy and strategic interests are properly
protected. It provides a predictable defence export policy framework. In considering
applications for defence export licences, the Government takes account of a range
of factors, including the implications of a potential sale for Australia's direct security
interests and for global and regional security, our obligations under UN and other
international agreements, and the domestic and international benefits of the sale
proceeding. The Government does not permit export of defence goods to any

and defence-related goods totalled $70.6 million. Australia is unlikely to become
a major exporter of a wide range of defence goods; rather, we will tend to aim at
niche markets. Nonetheless, defence industry export markets have grown
substantially over recent years, both because Australian manufacturing industry
has become more competitive and because the skills and capabilities of our defence
industries have been boosted by Australian companies producing equipment under
the Government's defence investment program.

11.41 South-East Asia offers particularly important opportunities for materiel
cooperation and defence exports. Many countries in the region are undertaking
substantial defence re-equipment programs, focusing on higher technology maritime
and air capabilities. Australia has long-standing expertise and strong recent
experience in these areas as a result of our acquisition programs in warship and
submarine construction. We will continue to emphasise the development of
cooperative materiel programs in which two or more countries work together to
develop, build and maintain defence equipment. Such programs provide
opportunities for all parties. Our long-standing defence relationships with many
countries in the region provide a strong basis to develop such arrangements.

11.42 The Government will support opportunities for materiel cooperation on
a case-by-case basis, and will judge them in the light of the benefits they offer for
Australia's defence interests. Especially important will be the prospective benefits
of any proposed project for selective interoperability and combined training, and
the likely contribution of the project to the development of a sustainable capacity
in Australian industry. In some circumstances, we will vary our own acquisition
plans marginally to enable collaboration if our national security interests will benefit.

11.43 While we will give regional markets our highest priority for promoting
exports and materiel cooperation, we will also support companies which seek
defence export opportunities elsewhere, including in markets in Europe and North
America. Australian collaboration with our traditional partners is well established,
and includes cooperating with the United States in developing the NULKA anti-
ship missile decoy and collaborating with New Zealand to build the ANZAC frigates.


-----

12.1 Australia relies for its defence on advanced technology and consequently
needs a high level of scientific and technological advice and support. The
Government has four broad objectives for this: to position Australia to exploit
future developments in technology which show promise for defence applications;
to ensure that Australia is an informed buyer of equipment; to develop new
capabilities as required; and to support existing capabilities by increasing operational
performance and reducing the costs of ownership, including through-life extension
programs.

12.2 Priorities for Australian defence research and development reflect a wide
range of factors. While Australia imports most of the technology embedded in its
defence capabilities, some aspects of our environment are sufficiently different
from those of other countries to demand unique equipment and technology. There
is a need for Australia itself to be able to provide the technological support essential
for Australian Defence Force operations and to understand comprehensively the
technological strengths and weaknesses of our capabilities. Moreover, we must
keep abreast of continuing advances in defence-relevant technology so that we
will be able to defend Australia into the future.

SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND NATIONAL DEFENCE

12.3 Managing defence science and technology to meet Australia's priorities
for defence and national security presents a number of challenges. Defence must
reconcile the demands of various customer groups in the Organisation, respond to
changes in our strategic circumstances and strike a balance between shorter and
longer term research.

12.4 Australia's move toward a more innovative and dynamic national support
base, the increased availability of advanced weapon systems at a global level,
continuing advances in defence technology and the continuing need to minimise
costs will all increase the demands on defence science and technology. In this
environment, priorities for Australian research and development will reflect the
priorities for capability development described in Chapter Five.

12.5 In this respect, there will be several recurring themes. These will include
support for intelligence, surveillance, electronic warfare, communications,
information technology and exploitation of environmental information, including

-----

12.37 To achieve these objectives, the Government will pay close attention to
the needs of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation's staff, including
their career and development needs. For its scientists and engineers in particular,
it will aim to provide a professional and physical environment which is conducive
to high personal performance, responsiveness, adaptability, scientific excellence
and efficiency. In this way, the Government will ensure that defence science will
be well positioned to provide the scientific and technological services on which 13.1 Successful management of our defence effort requires the closest possible
our national security so critically depends, both now and for the future. engagement with the Australian community. It requires the support and commitment
of the Australian people in peace, and even more in a time of emergency. That
support takes many forms. First and foremost, our Australian Defence Force
personnel are recruited from the Australian community and remain part of it. The
Government therefore invests considerable effort in ensuring the community's
awareness and understanding of the Australian Defence Force to ensure the
continued availability of suitable recruits. Public understanding of and confidence
in the Australian Defence Force in peace is also a means of ensuring the support of
the community which would be essential for our defence effort in a time of conflict.

13.2 As outlined in the preceding Chapters, support from the industrial and
commercial sectors is also essential to our defence efforts. This involves the
manufacture and supply of essential goods and equipment by Australian industry;
excellence in research and development skills which enable our defence effort to
be adapted, possibly in significant ways, to respond to developments which could
arise in the longer term; and the capacity to keep our force elements in the field
with timely repair and maintenance. The Commercial Support Program initiated
by the Government in 1992 aims to ensure greater involvement of commercial
contractors in defence-related activities in peace and thus to strengthen the capacity
to provide reliable and flexible logistic support in a time of conflict.

13.3 The Australian Defence Force is also dependent on civil infrastructure
such as roads, airfields, ports and communications networks, and the people who
manage and operate them. Civil communications bearers provide the backbone of
the Defence network. Close interaction between Defence and key transport and
communications organisations in peace provides the basis for a successful
partnership in a time of conflict. To facilitate planning in this area, Memoranda of
Agreement have been concluded with key transport organisations to ensure that
important civil assets and infrastructure would be available in an emergency.

13.4 The management of our national effort during conflict would involve a
range of Commonwealth and State agencies. The Government has mechanisms in
place to ensure that this effort would be coordinated fully. Major defence exercises
test and refine these arrangements by involving other agencies in planning and
preparation.

Funding Defence's Contribution to the Community

13.19 Elements of the Defence Organisation are frequently called upon to
provide support for the civil community. Although Defence's record of responding
is widely recognised and respected, the demands often involve significant costs,
and at times risk diverting resources needed for defence tasks or for maintaining
required levels of preparedness. Every effort will continue to be made to assist the
community where practicable, though the Australian Defence Force is not able to
meet all the requests it receives and those relating to non-emergency situations
will often need to be declined.

zones surrounding our training ranges and military bases. In feature areas such as
around Sydney Harbour, Garden Island in Western Australia and the entrance to
Port Phillip Bay, Defence has over several generations preserved a number of natural
areas which might otherwise have been lost to the community.

13.29 The Defence record on the environment was endorsed in the recent report
of the Commission of Inquiry into the Shoalwater Bay Training Area which
concluded that natural and cultural heritage values in the area had been maintained
overall. The Government has decided that the Australian Defence Force will have
exclusive use of the area. At Stirling Naval Base, Defence works closely with the
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the Western
Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management to manage an area
of sensitive flora and fauna which is now being nominated for inclusion on the
Register of the National Estate. At weapon firing ranges damage is unavoidable
but is limited to small and carefully managed impact zones surrounded by large
buffer areas which are carefully managed to protect flora and fauna in a natural
environment. Defence also preserves a number of heritage buildings such as Victoria
Barracks in Sydney and Melbourne.

13.30 The Defence Organisation also has a comprehensive Energy Management
Plan which seeks to ensure efficient use of resources, elimination of waste and
avoidance of damage to the environment. The plan seeks to implement Government
policy for stabilising greenhouse gas emissions, in particular, by setting a goal of
stabilising emissions of such gases by 2000 at the 1988 level, and of reducing
emissions by a further 20 per cent by 2005. It is supported by corporate information
management systems which maintain data on the level and nature of energy
consumption, allowing progress to be monitored in achieving energy targets for
buildings and commercial vehicles.

13.31 The equipment, organisational strength and personnel skills which
Defence acquires and maintains to enable it to meet its responsibilities for defending
Australia provide it with considerable capacity to respond to other national needs.
These activities do not determine the force structure, but Defence's ability to
undertake them demonstrates the versatility of its capabilities and its value to the
community.


-----

14.1 A strong national defence force which can ensure the security of present
and future generations ofAustralians must be paid for. Costs cannot be deferred in
the false hope of making up ground if our situation deteriorates. The lead times to
develop defence capabilities are far too long to permit us that luxury. Equally, the
resources devoted to Defence must support a level of capability with which we
could be confident of victory over aggression. The Government accepts this reality
and the obligations which go with it.

14.2 Defence therefore represents a major financial commitment for the nation
and the Government. The 1994-95 Defence Budget of $9,637 million constitutes
about 8 per cent of Commonwealth outlays, and just over 2 per cent of Australia's
Gross Domestic Product. Australians have a right to expect Defence to use this
funding wisely. Defence recognises this expectation and has put in place a number
of major reforms in recent years. These have involved major productivity increases
throughout the Defence Organisation, including radical restructuring and substantial
personnel reductions to minimise administrative and support overheads without
reducing capabilities. With the savings generated it has been possible to continue
the major defence investment program foreshadowed in **The Defence of Australia,**
**1987, despite slightly reduced Defence spending in more recent years in response**
to broader economic and budgetary pressures.

14.3 As strategic circumstances become more demanding, our Defence budget
will come under increasing pressure. One indication of this is the trend in defence
spending in our region. Defence spending has fallen sharply in many parts of the
world and has been relatively constant in Australia, but in Asia it is growing in
many countries by 5 per cent or more each year, and is likely to continue to do so.
We will need to continue to develop our defence force structure to maintain the
effectiveness of those capabilities which are vital to our security.

14.4 We will continue to seek further efficiencies, and expect they will cover
some proportion of the additional demands on Defence, without additional funding.
The scope for further efficiencies will decrease, however, as the more fruitful reforms
are completed. Funding at present levels, even with further retained savings and
efficiencies, will not support the program needed to maintain the effectiveness of
our Defence capabilities. For the next few years defence expenditure at presently
programmed levels will allow the plans and projects outlined in this White Paper
to proceed. Beyond that, modest real increases in Defence expenditure will be

14.17 Personnel costs are and will remain the largest element of defence costs.
To achieve cost-effective national defence, the Government implements measures
to ensure the most efficient use of personnel. This has enabled personnel costs to
be reduced from 60 per cent of the defence budget twenty years ago to under 40
per cent today.

expenditure will be freed by this process by 1997-98.

14.19 Further personnel related efficiencies will be sought, but the scope for
significant funds to be redirected into capabilities will reduce as most substantial
efficiency gains have already been made. Moreover, the demands of operating the
new and more sophisticated equipment planned to enter service in coming years
will increase the number of personnel needed in some areas and raise the per capita
personnel costs as skill levels increase. Even where personnel numbers can be
reduced further without detriment to capabilities, productivity-based pay increases
are required to have first call on any such savings.

1993-94; and $46 million agreed to date in _1994-95._

Five Year Budget

14.23 The Government will provide Defence with a five year budget
commitment, commencing in 1996-97. This will allow the Government to apply
the required strategic vision, consideration of long-term trends and consistency to
defence planning, and thus to optimise the value of its commitment to Defence
expenditure of approximately 2 per cent of Gross Domestic Product.

14.24 The five year budget commitment will meet the need of Defence planning
to be able to look well into the future and recommend long-term commitments
with confidence. Major defence capabilities cannot be introduced quickly. It takes
time to acquire equipment, to construct purpose-designed defence facilities and to
train personnel. Time is essential also to develop and nurture our international
relationships, and our national support base. By improving predictability of project
timing and a more even flow of defence work, additional opportunities will be
available for Australian industry to make the longer term investments to benefit
from defence work.

14.25 The five year budget commitment will provide Defence with a more secure
basis for long term planning of resource allocations. It will enable the programmed
development of capabilities over the longer term in accordance with evolving
strategic circumstances, the development of more cost-effective programs with
industry, and more efficient personnel planning and management.

S.1 Defending Australia sets out the Government's approach to managing
Australia's defence through the first decade of the next century. It explains how
the Government's defence policy will respond to changes expected over the next
fifteen years in our strategic environment, our national industrial and technological
base, and our society. It reaffirms the Government's commitment to ensuring that
in the decades ahead Australia will continue to be secure from military attack.

S.2 Armed force will remain a significant factor in international affairs, and
Australia must ensure that it cannot be successfully used against us. Ultimately,
we must rely on our own armed forces to do this. While our strategic environment
is not presently threatening, we must look now to our needs in 2010 and beyond
because major defence capabilities take many years to develop. Moreover,
maintaining a strong defence force helps to make conflict less likely, and contributes
to Australia's international interests and standing.

S.3 Our strategic environment will change over the next fifteen years under
the influence of two major trends. One is the changing strategic postures and
relationships of the major powers in Asia following the end of the Cold War. The
other is economic change throughout Asia, which is increasing the military and
strategic potential of countries in the region. As a result of these trends and of
political change which can be expected in a number of countries, the strategic
environment in Asia and the Pacific will become more fluid and complex, and
military capabilities throughout our region will grow. Australia's strategic
environment thus will become more demanding.

S.4 The first priority of Australian defence policy is to build, maintain and
support forces which are capable, without help from the combat forces of other
countries, of defeating any attack which could credibly be mounted against Australia.
This objective determines the way we structure and equip the Australian Defence
Force. Our security from armed attack does not, however, depend on our defence
capabilities alone. It depends also on maintaining a global and regional environment
which makes the use of armed force against Australia less likely.

Planning Defence Capabilities

_S.5 Careful planning for the defence of Australia ensures that we have the_
level and mix of capabilities necessary for defence self-reliance. The posture and
forces we require, now and in the future, are determined by our strategic geography
and the nature and level of forces which could credibly be used against us.

1. This Appendix describes each of the major elements of the Defence
Organisation, which work together to ensure a one team approach to national defence
under the joint leadership of the Chief of the Defence Force and the Secretary,
Department of Defence. The major elements of the Organisation include the Force
Executive Program, the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Army, the Royal
Australian Air Force, the Strategy and Intelligence Program, the Acquisition and
Logistics Program, the Budget and Management Program and the Science and
Technology Program.

FORCES EXECUTIVE PROGRAM

2. The Forces Executive Program consists of the Headquarters Australian
Defence Force, as well as senior Defence colleges, the Australian Defence Force
Academy, Defence Recruiting and other organisations such as Emergency
Management Australia.

3. The Chief of the Defence Force provides advice to the Government on
military operational matters and exercises day-to-day strategic command of the
Australian Defence Force. Some 560 civilians and on average, 2,090 military
personnel from all three Services are employed in the Forces Executive Program.
(These military personnel are included in the total numbers of their respective
Services.) The Forces Executive Program includes key Headquarters functions
such as the development of military strategy and concepts, force development,
guidance and doctrine for the conduct of operations, and personnel policy and
management. Within the Headquarters, the Vice Chief of the Defence Force, as
the principal staff officer to the Chief of the Defence Force, is Chief of Staff of the
Headquarters and has policy responsibility for the Forces Executive Program.

4. Operational forces are under the overall command of the Chief of the
Defence Force, through the joint commanders based in the Sydney area - Maritime,
