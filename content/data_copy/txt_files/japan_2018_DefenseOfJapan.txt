**On the Publication of Defense of Japan 2018**

Minister of Defense
**Itsunori Onodera**

The Ministry of Defense (MOD) / the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) is constantly committed to crisis
management and takes on the noble mission of defending Japan’s independence, peace, and security and
securing the lives and property of the Japanese people.

Looking at the security environment surrounding Japan, North Korea, repeatedly carried out
nuclear tests and launched ballistic missiles through last year, and begun to engage in dialogue this year.
Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the reality that North Korea still continues to possess and deploy several
hundred Nodong missiles capable of reaching almost every part of Japan. In addressing the North Korean
nuclear and missile issue, it is essential for the international community to remain united, following results
at the U.S.-North Korea Summit Meeting held in June 2018, toward the realization of the dismantlement
of all weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles of all ranges in a complete, verifiable, and
irreversible manner. Japan needs to carefully monitor specific actions by North Korea.
China’s recent activities, including its rapid military modernization and enhancement of operational
capabilities, its unilateral escalation of actions in areas around Japan, and with the lack of transparency in
the military build-up, present a strong security concern for the region including Japan and the international
community. In addition, Russia continues frequent activities around Japan. Furthermore, global security
issues, including challenges emerging in new domains such as outer space and cyberspace, are broadening
and diversifying.

Given these circumstances, the MOD/SDF must strengthen Japan’s defense capabilities and expand
its role in order to fulfill our mission. For this purpose, we are currently reviewing the National Defense
Program Guidelines and examining the next Medium-Term Defense Program to complete them by the
end of this year under the instruction from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Concerning this process, we will
identify what defense capabilities are truly needed to protect the people, rather than simply extending the
existing capabilities


-----

It is also necessary to further strengthen the
Japan-U.S. Alliance. Since I was appointed as
Defense Minister last year, I have been in close
consultation with U.S. Secretary of Defense James
Mattis and pursued close cooperation between
Japan and the United States. Our two countries have
closely coordinated our understanding and policies
and taken united actions in responding to North
Korea issues. We are striving to further reinforce the
bonds of the Japan-U.S. Alliance and strengthen the
deterrence and response capabilities of the Alliance.
At the same time, initiatives to mitigate the impact
of the bases on the local residents in Okinawa and Minister of Defense Itsunori Onodera and U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis shaking handsat the Japan-U.S. Defense Ministerial Meeting (June 2018)
other areas are important and we continue to listen
sincerely to the local residents’ voices and make
further efforts.
Japan must also continue to promote security cooperation with other countries. In recent years, we
have steadily expanded a variety of cooperation, including bilateral/multilateral training, joint development
of equipment, and capacity building assistance, with many other countries that share fundamental values
and security interests. Japan intends to robustly promote strategic international defense cooperation as
part of further commitment to peace and stability in the region and the international community from the
standpoint of “Proactive Contribution to Peace” based on the principle of international cooperation.

While the MOD/SDF is steadily implementing a variety of measures in this way, individuals of the
SDF, who diligently work day and night, despite the dangers, with abundant motivation and a strong sense
of responsibility in difficult environments, such as posts on remote islands, radar sites, and on-board ships
away from home, are obviously the ones who are carrying out these measures.
This year’s Defense White Paper explains the measures taken by the MOD/SDF in detail and the
opening feature introduces the front-line SDF members, who assiduously and seriously carry out their
duties as part of 24-hour, 365-day operations. By this, we aim to promote a wider understanding of how
steady implementation of these measures and daily efforts of the SDF members contribute to the peaceful
lives and securing of the Japanese people.

The MOD/SDF must gain support and trust of the Japanese people in order to fully exert our
capabilities and fulfill our mission. It is sincerely regretted that issues related to document management
and information disclosure have significantly affected the trust of the Japanese people in the MOD/SDF
in the past two years. The MOD/SDF continues to vigorously strive to prevent the recurrence so that such
issues never happen again.

Finally, we hope that many people will take the Defense White Paper in hand and deepen their
understanding of the MOD/SDF and think about the SDF members who are carrying out their missions in
various locations to protect our peaceful lives even at this moment

###### Defense Chronology

**Events related to North Korea’s nuclear and missile development**

Since 2016, North Korea has conducted three nuclear tests and launched as many as 40 ballistic missiles. These military activities by North Korea pose an

unprecedentedly serious and imminent threat to Japan’s security and signifi cantly undermine the peace and security of the region and international community.

**Security Situation**
**Surrounding Japan**

While appreciating the signifi cance of another clear promise by Chairman Kim Jong-un in a written document to work toward complete denuclearization of the

Korean Peninsula in the joint declaration from the U.S.-North Korea Summit Meeting in June 2018, it is important to closely monitor specifi c actions by North Korea

to eliminate nuclear and missile capabilities.

Taking into consideration the fact that North Korea possesses and deploys several hundred Nodong missiles capable of reaching almost every part of Japan as well

as advancements in the development and operational capabilities of nuclear weapons and missiles through repeated nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches

to date, there is no change in our basic recognition concerning the threat of North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missiles.

**Exchanges with Other Countries**

**Active promotion of security cooperation**

Security challenges in today’s international community cannot be resolved just by a single country on its own and require cooperation with other countries.

Promotion of defense cooperation and exchanges with other countries is highly important in building face-to-face relationships to deal with various security issues

in the region and international community in cooperation with each other.

The Ministry of Defense and the Self-Defense Forces are constantly gathering information and conducting surveillance in order to resolutely protect the lives

of Japanese people and defend Japan’s territorial land, waters and airspace from the threat of ballistic missiles. Currently, Japan utilizes multi-tier defense

via an automatic warning and control system (Japan Aerospace Defense Ground Environment; JADGE) that effectively coordinates 1) upper-tier interception

by Aegis-equipped destroyers and 2) lower-tier interception by Patriot PAC-3 to deal with ballistic missiles that fl y toward Japan.

Enhancement of ballistic missile defense capabilities

Resolutely securing the lives and peaceful livelihood of the people of the country is the most important responsibility for the government. The current circumstance

indicates that the enhancement of Japan’s defense capability against ballistic missiles is an urgent issue, considering the fact that North Korea still holds a number

of various types of ballistic missiles, which cover Japan within their range. Amid such a situation, the installation of Aegis Ashore missile defense systems will

drastically improve Japan's defense capability for ensuring the seamless security of the country on a 24 hours a day and 365 days a year basis.

**Measures against airspace violations**

The Air Self-Defense Force detects and identifi es aircraft fl ying in areas around Japan’s

airspace. When the ASDF fi nds an aircraft that might violate Japan’s airspace, fi ghters and

other aircraft embark on an emergency scramble to confi rm the subject aircraft and monitor

the situation. If the aircraft vilolates Japan’s airspace, the ASDF issues a warning to leave.

Japan began measures against airspace violations in 1958 and has conducted a total of

27,144 scrambles so far as of the end of FY2017.

Chapter 1

**Overview** P. 45
The security environment surrounding Japan has become increasingly severe, with various challenges and destabilizing factors
becoming more tangible and acute.

**Security Environment in the Asia-Pacifi c Region** **P. 45**

1 In the area surrounding Japan, there is a concentration of nations with large-scale military capabilities, and a regional cooperation framework

on security has not yet to be fully institutionalized, leading to the existence of uncertainty and unclarity, including the persistence of territorial
disputes and unifi cation issues.

2 Meanwhile, there has been a tendency towards an increase in and prolongation of so-called “gray-zone” situations; that is, neither pure

peacetime nor contingencies over territory, sovereignty, and economic interests.

3 There has also been a noticeable trend among neighboring countries to modernize and reinforce their military capabilities and to intensify their

military activities. The security challenges and destabilizing factors in the Asia-Pacifi c region are characterized below:

-  North Korea’s military development such as nuclear weapon and ballistic missile development represents an unprecedentedly serious and
imminent threat.

-  The unilateral escalation of China’s military activities poses a strong security concern for the region including Japan and international community.

-  Russia has tendency to intensify its military activities, including in areas surrounding Japan, and this trend needs to paid due attention.

4 Territorial disputes over the Northern Territories and Takeshima, both of which are inherent parts of the territory of Japan, remain unresolved.

Chapter 2
**United States** P. 53

**The Trump Administration’s Security Policy** **P. 53**

1 The Trump Administration released its National Security Strategy, National Defense Strategy and Nuclear Posture Review, clarifying its policy on

security and national defense strategy.

2 Within these documents, the Trump Administration cites the following three types of main challengers competing with the United States and

states the main security concern of the United States is not terrorism, but rather long-term strategic competition with China and Russia.

-  China and Russia: Revisionist powers

-  Iran and North Korea: Rogue states

-  Jihadist terrorists: Transnational threat organizations

3 Given this recognition, the United States emphasizes maintaining military superiority, its commitments to the Indo-Pacifi c Region, and

strengthening relations with allies.

**Nuclear Strategy and Missile Defense Policy** **P. 58**

1 In terms of nuclear posture, in the near term the United States will modify a small number of existing SLBM warheads to provide a low-yield

option, and in the long term, pursue a modern nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles.

2 As for the country’s missile defense posture, the United States plans to reinforce both mainland defense and regional defense as well as work

on the development of cutting edge technologies, in order to respond the threat of not only ballistic missiles, but also cruise missiles and other
weapons systems.

**Indo-Pacifi c Strategy** **P. 55**

1 The United States champions a vision of promoting a free and open Indo-Pacifi c in the Indo-Pacifi c Region.

2 This vision calls for the following U.S. policies:

-  North Korea’s nuclear and missile development: while maintaining negotiations with North Korea on denuclearization, keep sanctions until
denuclearization becomes apparent, and continue to maintain presence of the United States Forces Korea.

-  China’s maritime advances: remain involved in the free and lawful use of the seas through the Freedom of Navigation Operations, while not
tolerating unilateral changes in the status quo.

**Surrounding Japan**

Chapter 2

**North Korea** P. 63

1 Since 2016, North Korea has willfully conducted three nuclear tests and launched as many as 40 ballistic missiles. These military trends in North

Korea pose an unprecedentedly serious and imminent threat to Japan’s security, and signifi cantly damage the peace and security of the region
and the international community.

2 In the joint declaration at the fi rst-ever U.S.-North Korea Summit Meeting in June 2018, North Korea gave a commitment to work toward

complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and confi rmed that it plans to continue the negotiations between the two sides. It is highly
signifi cant that Chairman Kim Jong-un reiterated his intension for the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and made a clear
promise to do so in a written document.

3 It is important to closely monitor specifi c actions by North Korea to eliminate nuclear and missile capabilities.

4 Taking into consideration the fact that North Korea appears to possess and deploy several hundred Nodong missiles capable of reaching almost

every part of Japan as well as advancements in the development and operational capabilities of nuclear weapons and missiles through repeated
nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches to date, there is no change in our basic recognition concerning the threat of North Korea's nuclear
weapons and missiles.

**Development of WMD and Ballistic Missiles** **P. 66**

1 North Korea willfully conducted its sixth nuclear test in September 2017. The yield of the weapon is estimated at around 160kt, making it the

largest yielding test to date. It is diffi cult to deny the possibility that it was a hydrogen bomb test.

2 Considering the technological maturity estimated to have been achieved through these six nuclear tests, it is possible that North Korea has

already achieved the miniaturization of nuclear weapons and has developed nuclear warheads so that nuclear weapons can be loaded into
ballistic missiles.

3 As for whether North Korea has demonstrated warhead reentry technologies, while detailed analysis is necessary, North Korea can be accumulating

related technologies through its repeated missile launches.

4 North Korea is suspected to have several facilities capable of producing chemical agents and already a substantial stockpile of such agents. North

Korea is also thought to have some infrastructure for the production of biological weapons. The possibility cannot be denied that North Korea is
able to load biological and/or chemical weapons on ballistic missiles.


-----

5 In terms of ballistic missiles, North Korea appears to be aiming to (1) advance long-range ballistic missiles' technological reliability, (2) enhance

the accuracy and operational capabilities necessary for saturation attacks, (3) improve its ability to conduct surprise attacks, and (4) diversify the
forms of launches.

6 If North Korea advances further in development of ballistic missiles and other activities and overconfi dently and wrongly believes that it has

obtained strategic deterrence against the United States, there is possibility of increased and more serious military provocations in the region and
could lead to circumstances that raise strong concerns for Japan.

**Rapid modernization** **P. 90**

1 Underpinned by high level of increases in defense budget, China is considered to reinforce its military capabilities broadly and rapidly with a focus

on nuclear and missile force, as well as its Navy and Air Force. As part of this China has been strengthening its so-called A2/AD capabilities.

2 Besides this type of strengthening military capabilities from past years, China is pursuing new types of practical operational capabilities, such as

those of electronic and cyber warfare, in recent years.

3 Considering Xi Jinping’s further consolidation of authoritative power as Chairman of the Central Military Commission, China’s military

modernization to improve practical operational capabilities can be accelerated more strongly in the future.

4 China aims to realize fundamental modernization of its military forces, namely the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), by 2035 and transform the PLA

into one of the world’s top militaries by the middle of the 21st century, intending to rapidly enhance its military capabilities in accordance with
its increasing national strength.

**Unilateral escalation of China’s activities around Japan** **P. 104**

1 China’s sea and air power is expanding its operational areas, including the area around Senkaku Islands, undertaking further activities which are

seemingly based on its own claim regarding the islands.

2 China is considered to attempt to routinize its naval ships’ navigation in waters close to Japan and its presumable sea and air power’s training

activities which accompany entry into the Pacifi c Ocean. At the same time, the quality of its activities is showing continuous improvement,
including a pursuit of developing practical joint operational capability.

3 Suffi cient attention should be paid to issues regarding China’s offshore platforms.

**China’s attempts to change the status quo by coercion** **P. 115**

1 China, over maritime issues where its interests confl ict with others’ continues to act in a way which can be considered assertive, such as

attempts at changing the status quo by coercion.

2 China has pressed ahead with rapid and large-scale land reclamation on seven features in the Spratly Islands, installing military facilities such as

artillery batteries, and transforming these features into military installations. Furthermore, China is promoting militarization of the Paracel Islands
too, as bomber takeoff and landing exercises are pointed out to be implemented, for example. China’s military activities in South China Sea are
expanding, and the expansion itself is to change the status quo by coercion and to promote the changed status as an accomplished fact.

3 The United States is conducting Freedom of Navigation Operations in the waters such as South China Sea to cope with over-claiming of maritime

interests, including one by China.

4 However, China is exhibiting interest in initiatives to avoid and prevent unexpected contingency in the sea and airspace. For example, in May

2018, Japan and China offi cially agreed to implement “Maritime and Aerial Communication Mechanism between the Defense Authorities of
Japan-China.”

5 Nevertheless, China’s rapid modernization of the PLA, enhancement of operational capabilities, and unilateral escalation of activities in

areas close to Japan, without sufficient transparency, are generating strong security concerns in the region and international community,
including Japan.

6 It is probable that the PLA plays a backing role in Belt and Road Initiative through its activities such as sea lane protection. In addition,

development of infrastructure under the initiative can lead to further expansion of the PLA’s activities in the area such as the Pacifi c Ocean
and the Indian Ocean.

future, he emphasized to further bolster its defense capability, while stating his commitment to pursue constructive relations with other countries
without the intention of starting an arms race.

2 With regards to Europe, Russia is negative about the expansion of NATO, and has deployed three divisions near the border with Ukraine etc, and

conducted the large-scale training exercise Zapad-2017 in September last year.

3 As for Syria, Russia announced naval and air bases in Syria will continue to operate on a permanent basis. Attention will continue to be paid to

Russia’s moves to expand its infl uence in the Middle East.

4 In the Far East, Russia has been developing its newest class of frigate (Steregushchiy class) and fi ghter jets (Su-35 and Su-34). In 2018, Russia

also plans on holding a large-scale military exercise called Vostok-2018.

5 Russia announced deployment of surface-to-ship missiles in the Northern Territories (Etorofu and Kunashiri islands), and it is also intensifying

activities in Etorofu island, including designation of a civilian airport to both civilian and military use and deployment of fi ghters.

6 Russia tends to increase its military activities, including in areas near Japan, and it is necessary to closely observe this trend.

**International Terrorism**

1 ISIL has lost nearly all of the territory it once controlled as a result of military operations by the U.S.-led coalition and local forces. However, ISIL-

affi liated groups continue to actively carry out terrorist attacks in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.

2 The threat for terrorism is spreading globally, including “homegrown” terrorism perpetrated by individuals or groups who are inspired by extremist

ideologies and foreign terrorist fi ghters returning to their countries of origin after fi ghting for ISIL.

3 It is essential for Japan to once again address the threat of international terrorism head-on in light of ISIL’s repeated reference to Japanese people

as targets of attack and the attack in Dhaka (Bangladesh) in 2016.

4 In the Syrian theater, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France concluded that the Assad regime used chemical weapons and carried

out attacks on Syria’s chemical weapon facilities. Related countries and various forces remain in confl ict, as seen in strong criticism of this action
by Russia, a key supporter of the Assad regime. There is still no end in sight to military clashes in Syria.

Effective Means of Deterrence and Response to Various Situations
(1) Ensuring the security of the sea and airspace surrounding Japan (2) Respond to an attack on remote islands (3) Response to ballistic missile

2 The Medium Term Defense Program (MTDP)(FY2014-FY2018) developed in December 2013 based on the NDPG specifi es the review of major

units, major projects concerned with the capability of the SDF, the maintenance scale of main equipment, and required expenses.

1 As 2018 marks the fi nal fi scal year for the current MTDP, a new NDPG is also be discussed towards the end of 2018.

2 This is based on the necessity to identify what defense capabilities are truly needed to protect the people, rather than simply extending existing

capabilities, looking squarely at the reality of the increasingly severe security environment.

3 Concerning this process, it is essential to secure necessary and suffi cient defense capabilities qualitatively and quantitatively. Given that it is

especially vital to utilize capabilities in new domains such as space and cyberspace, it would be no longer inadequate to consider problems in
the conventional domains - i.e, land, sea, and air, and it is necessary to develop capabilities in these areas.

functions as a “public good” that contributes to the stability and prosperity not only
of Japan but also of the Asia-Pacifi c region and the world at large.

2 As the security environment surrounding Japan becomes increasingly severe

and the United States meanwhile maintains and strengthens its engagement and
presence in the Asia-Pacifi c region, it has become more important than ever to
strengthen the Japan-U.S. Alliance for the security of Japan.

**Stationing of U.S. Forces in Okinawa** **P. 284**

1 Approximately 70% of USFJ facilities and areas (for exclusive use) in Japan are concentrated in Okinawa

Prefecture, occupying approximately 14% of the main island of Okinawa. Therefore, it is necessary to
continue to make utmost efforts to mitigate the impact.

2 A number of steps have been taken to mitigate the impact on Okinawa while maintaining security in

the region, including releasing of land areas south of the Kadena Air Base, reducing troop numbers in
Okinawa and relocating to Guam, and training relocation of tilt-rotor/rotary-wing aircraft such as U.S.
Marine Corps’ MV-22 Osprey aircraft.

4 The following progress has been made involving the return of USFJ land:

-  March 2015: West Futenma Housing Area of Camp Zukeran ( Camp Foster) (about 51 ha) was returned. This land was returned to the
owner in March 2018 after soil pollution surveys, etc.

-  December 2016: The return of approximately 4,000 ha, a major portion of the Northern Training Area, was achieved, the largest of
its kind since the reversion of Okinawa to the mainland. This land was returned to the owner in December 2017 after soil pollution
surveys, etc.

-  July 2017: A portion of MCAS Futenma (about 4 ha along Ginowan City road 11) was returned

-  March 2018: A portion of Makiminato Service Area(Camp Kinser) (about 3 ha of land to expand Route 58) was returned

**Stationing of the U.S. Forces in Regions Other than Okinawa** **P. 299**

-  In regions other than Okinawa, the MOD is implementing measures to consolidate facilities and areas
of USFJ and to proceed with the realignment of USFJ. Such measures are aimed at securing the stable
presence of the U.S. Forces while maintaining its deterrence capabilities and trying to mitigate the
impact on local communities. The relocation of Carrier Air Wing Five (CVW-5) squadrons from Naval Air
Facility Atsugi to MCAS Iwakuni began in August 2017 and was completed in March 2018. FA-18 relocated to MCAS Iwakuni

**Measures to Mitigate the Impact Posed by Facilities and Areas Used by USFJ** **P. 305**

-  Ensuring the safety of local residents is of prime importance in USFJ operations. The two countries cooperate with a prime focus on ensuring
the safety so that accidents or incidents will not occur.

**Effective Deterrence and Response** P. 314

In order to respond to a variety of contingencies in a timely and appropriate manner, and to ensure the protection of the lives
and property of the people as well as territorial land, water and airspace, it is necessary to make efforts to deter the occurrence
of a variety of contingencies before they happen by building a comprehensive defense system. If a contingency does occur, it is
required to respond seamlessly to the situations as they unfold. The MOD/SDF take the following initiatives.

**Ensuring Security of the Sea and Airspace Surrounding Japan** **P. 314**

-  The SDF persistently engages in warning and surveillance activities in the water and airspace surrounding Japan during peacetime so that
it can respond to various contingencies immediately and seamlessly. Information gathered through these activities are shared with other
relevant government agencies.

Suspicion Illegal Transfer of Goods at Sea (Ship-to-ship Transfer) by North Korea-related Vessels

1 As part of its warning and surveillance activities in the water surrounding Japan, the SDF

gathers information on vessels suspected of violating the UN Security Council resolutions.

2 Up to the end of June 2018, the SDF has confi rmed and made public 9activities that were Rye Song Gang-1

highly likely to be illegal transfers of goods at sea (so-called “ship-to-ship transfer”) by
North Korea-related vessels.

3 In order to conduct warning and surveillance by aircraft and such against illegal activities

at sea including “ship-to-ship” transfer, Australian and Canadian patrol aircraft were
deployed to Japan for about a month from the end of April in 2018. British Royal Navy’s Wan Heng-11

**Overview**


The security environment surrounding Japan has
become increasingly severe, with various challenges and
destabilizing factors becoming more tangible and acute.
While nations with large military forces are concentrated
in this region, a regional cooperation framework in the
security realm has not been suffi ciently institutionalized.
Opaque and uncertain factors such as territorial disputes
and reunifi cation issues remain. There has been also
a tendency towards an increase in and prolongation of
so-called “gray-zone” situations, that is, neither pure
peacetime nor contingencies over territory, sovereignty,
and maritime economic interests. In addition, there has
been a noticeable trend among neighboring countries
to modernize and reinforce their military capabilities
and to intensify their military activities. In this regard,
security challenges and destabilizing factors in the AsiaPacifi c region including the area surrounding Japan are
becoming more serious.
In particular, North Korea has conducted three
nuclear tests including the biggest by far since 2016. It also
launched 40 ballistic missiles including those that fl ew
over Japan and intercontinental-range ballistic missiles.
North Korea’s military development such as its nuclear
and missile development constitute unprecedented,
serious and imminent threats to the security of Japan.
China has reinforced its military capabilities without
transparency. It also continues its unilateral attempts to
change the status quo in the East and South China Seas
with the backdrop of power based on its unique assertions
which are incompatible with the existing order of
international law. In addition, China has been unilaterally
escalating its operations in the periphery of Japan. These
trends have become serious security concerns to the region
including Japan and to the international community and
continued attention needs to be paid.

**Section 1 Asia Pacifi c Security Environment**


The Asia-Pacifi c is a unique region with a concentration
of large-scale military forces. Recently, the shift in the
l b l b l f t i f th i


Russia has been modernizing its forces including
its nuclear capability not only in the Europe region but
in the periphery of Japan. It has increased its military
activities such as enhancement of military deployment in
the Northern Territories and Chishima Islands and close
attention needs to be paid to its development.
In addition, emerging global security challenges
include regional confl icts growing in complexity,
international terrorism becoming more serious,
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and
securing the stable use of new domains such as maritime,
outer space and cyber space.
The security challenges and destabilizing factors
in the international community which has these
characteristics are complex, diverse, and wide-ranging,
and it is becoming ever more diffi cult for a single
country to deal with them on its own. In this context, it is
increasingly important for countries which share interests
in regional and global stability to cooperate and actively
respond to security challenges. Cross-cutting government
efforts are also critical to overcome these challenges.

**[KEY WORD]**

“Gray-zone” situations

So-called “gray-zone” situations concisely describe a broad range

specifi c and practical intra-regional coordination and
collaboration with a particular focus on non-traditional
security fi elds such as humanitarian assistance and
disaster relief.
Opportunities for bilateral defense exchanges
between countries in the region have increased in
recent years. Multilateral security dialogues, including
the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), the ASEAN
Defense Ministers’ Meeting-Plus (ADMM Plus),
conferences hosted by nongovernmental institutions
with the participation of relevant defense ministers,
and bilateral and multilateral joint exercises are held.
Promoting and developing such multilayered approaches
among countries is also important to ensure stability in
the region.
Also, views on security and perceptions of threats are
different by country. Therefore, a regional cooperation
framework in the security realm has not been suffi ciently
institutionalized, and longstanding issues of territorial
rights and reunifi cation continue to remain in the region.
In the Korean Peninsula, the Korean people have
been divided for more than half a century, and the
faceoff continues between the military forces of the
Republic of Korea (ROK) and North Korea. There are
issues concerning Taiwan and the South China Sea.
Furthermore, with regard to Japan, territorial disputes
over the Northern Territories and Takeshima, both of
which are inherent parts of the territory of Japan, remain
unresolved. On top of this, recent years have seen a
continued tendency towards the prolongation of “grayzone” situations, raising concerns that they may develop
into more serious situations in the absence of a clear path
towards the resolution of the situations.
In North Korea, it is deemed that following the
change of regime that made Chairman of the State
Affairs Commission Kim Jong-un the leader of the
country, the regime continues to strengthen and tighten
its grip to make Chairman Kim Jong-un the sole leader.
North Korea is military-focused and deploys a massive
military force. It is also furthering its development and
operational capabilities of weapons of mass destruction
(WMDs), including nuclear weapons and ballistic
missiles, and it maintains a large-scale special operations
force. Through these activities, North Korea is believed
to continue to maintain and strengthen asymmetrical
military capabilities.[1] In particular, it is regarded that
North Korea has further advanced its entire ballistic
missile program, including new type ballistic missiles,


through technological verifi cation conducted by
launching a series of ballistic missiles. Recently, North
Korea has not only engaged in research and development
of ballistic missiles, but has also intensifi ed activities
to increase their operational capabilities, including
surprise attack. North Korea has conducted nuclear tests
in defi ance of calls of restraint from the international
community. As for the sixth nuclear test conducted in
September 2017, the possibility can’t be denied that it
was a hydrogen bomb test as it was estimated to have been
about a 160-kiloton yield. Considering the technological
maturity reached through the past six nuclear tests, it is
possible that North Korea has successfully miniaturized
nuclear weapons for warheads and enabled them to be
equipped on ballistic missiles. With the passage of time,
there will likely be a growing risk that North Korea
would deploy ballistic missiles mounted with a nuclear
warhead that have ranges covering Japan. North Korea
has repeated provocative rhetoric and behavior against
related countries including Japan. In 2013, North Korea
emphasized that Japan is within the range of its missiles,
referring to specifi c Japanese cities, and in March 2017,
North Korea announced that it had launched four ballistic
missiles as part of the exercise for striking the bases of the
U.S. military forces in Japan. North Korea has repeatedly
shown its intention to attack Japan using nuclear weapons
as seen in the recent statement of “using nuclear weapon
to sink Japan” released by Korean Central Television.
Such North Korean military trends, coupled with its
provocative words and actions such as threats to missile
attack against Japan, constitute a serious and imminent
threat to the security not only of Japan but also of the
entire region and the international community. North
Korea’s abduction of Japanese nationals, a grave issue
concerning the sovereignty of Japan and the lives and
security of the Japanese people, is yet to be resolved. A
solution will require concrete actions by North Korea.
Today, China has signifi cant infl uence in the
international community. Accordingly, there continues
to be strong expectations on China to recognize its
responsibility in the international community, accept
and comply with international norms, and play an
active role in a more cooperative manner in regional
and global issues. In the meantime, China has been
trying to establish unique international order, has been
continuously increasing its defense budget at a high level,
and has been rapidly reinforcing its military capabilities
in a wide range of areas, without suffi cient transparency.


Asymmetrical military capabilities, in this context, refer to means of attack different from those of an opponent with superior conventional military capabilities. Such measures are exploited to


-----

In particular, China is believed to be making efforts to
strengthen its asymmetrical military capabilities to
prevent military activities by other countries in the region,
denying access and deployment of foreign militaries to
its surrounding areas (“Anti-Access/Area-Denial” [“A2/
AD”] capabilities), and recently, rapidly materializing
large-scale military reforms designed to build its joint
operations structure with actual combat in mind. In
addition, China is rapidly expanding and intensifying its
activities both in quality and quantity in the maritime and
aerial domains in the region, including in the East and
South China Seas. In particular, China has continued to
take assertive actions with regard to issues of confl icts
of interest in the maritime domain, as exemplifi ed by its
attempts to change the status quo by coercion, and has
signaled its position to realize its unilateral assertions
without making any compromises.
As for the seas and airspace around Japan, Chinese
government ships have routinely and repeatedly intruded
into Japan’s territorial waters, and Chinese naval vessels
and air forces has further expanded its operations in
areas including the waters surrounding and airspace
over the Senkaku Islands. In June 2016, a Jiangkai
I-class frigate became the fi rst Chinese naval combatant
vessel to enter the contiguous zone off the Senkaku
Islands and in January 2018, a Shang-class submarine
navigating underwater and a Jiangkai II-class frigate each
entered the same contiguous zone. This marked the fi rst
confi rmed case in which a submerged submarine entered
into the contiguous zone off the Senkaku Islands. These
activities by the Chinese Navy represent an attempt
to change the status quo unilaterally using force and
escalate the situation one-sidedly. Moreover, they pose a
serious concern to Japan. In addition, China has engaged
in dangerous activities that could cause unintended
consequences, such as its naval vessel’s direction of fi re
control radar at a Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force
(MSDF) destroyer, the fl ight of fi ghters abnormally close
to SDF aircraft, and its announcement of establishing
the “East China Sea Air Defense Identifi cation Zone
(ADIZ)” based on its own assertion, thereby infringing
the freedom of overfl ight.
In the South China Sea, China has continued largescale and rapid reclamation of multiple features based on
China’s unique assertions which are incompatible with
the existing international order. The verdict handed down
by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague in
July 2016 with regard to the case involving China and
the Philippines rejected the rights claimed by China in
the sea included in the “Nine-Dash Line,” including
“hi t i i ht ” d th b i f th “Ni D h


Line, and found that China s activities including land
reclamation are illegal. However, China has made it clear
that it does not intend to follow this decision. Even today,
China is developing, in addition to military facilities such
as artillery, various infrastructures that can be used for
military purposes including runways, ports, hangars,
and radar installations among others, moving ahead with
making these features military outposts. In addition, in
July and August 2016 after the verdict, Chinese Air Force
H-6K bombers conducted “combat patrol fl ight” in the
airspace near Scarborough Shoal, and China’s Ministry
of National Defense announced that these fl ights would
be “regularized” in the future. This shows that China’s
military is expanding activities in the seas and airspace of
the South China Sea.
These Chinese activities represent serious security
concerns of the region encompassing Japan, and of
the international community, and need to be watched
out for with intense interest. China is urged to further
increase transparency regarding its military and enhance
its compliance with international norms. It is a key task
to further strengthen mutual understanding and trust
by promoting dialogue and exchanges with China, and
make further progress on measures to build trust, such as
measures to avoid and prevent unintended consequences
in the maritime domain.
In Russia, President Vladimir Putin, who has been
seeking the revival of Russia as a strong and infl uential
power, achieved reelection to his fourth term in March
2018. It is deemed that Russia has promoted the
strengthening of the readiness of its Armed Forces and
the development and acquisition of new equipment, while
continuing to give priority to its nuclear force.
Even as expenditure cuts are thus made in a wide range
of areas, Russia has striven to secure defense spending and
has continued to modernize its Armed Forces. Recently,
Russia has intensifi ed its military activities not only in
the Asia-Pacifi c region, but also in the Arctic, the Europe

region, the periphery of the United States, and the Middle
East, and has been expanding the area of activities.
Specifi cally, from the perspective of Europe and
the United States, Russia is believed to be changing the
status quo using force by engaging in so-called “hybrid
warfare”[2] in Ukraine which Russia regards as a part of
its sphere of infl uence. This is recognized as not only a
strong concern for European countries, but also a global
issue that could potentially engulf the entire international
community including Asia. Russia is also appearing to be
expanding its infl uence internationally, including through
its involvement in the Syria Civil War as a supporter of
the Assad regime.
In the Far East, the Russian Armed Forces have
conducted large-scale exercises. Russia has unveiled the
deployment of coastal (surface-to-ship) missiles in the
Northern Territories and has referred to a plan to deploy
a division to the Northern Territories or the Chishima


Islands, and thus continued attention needs to be paid to
Russian military development in the Far East, including
the Four Northern Islands.
As seen above, in the Asia-Pacifi c region, where the
security environment has increasingly grown severe, the
presence of the U.S. Forces remains extremely important
in order to achieve regional stability. Accordingly, Japan
and other countries, such as Australia and the ROK, have
established bilateral alliances and partnerships with the
United States, and allow the stationing and rotational
deployment of the U.S. Forces in their territories. In regard
to the responses to the unilateral changes in the status
quo by force or coercion based on unique assertions, it
is important for the international community centered
around countries in the region to make concerted efforts
to protect the existing international order based on law.

**Section 2 Global Security Environment**


The current global security environment has two aspects.
Firstly, the United States, which remains the world’s
most powerful nation, is thought to play an ongoing
role in ensuring global peace and security. Meanwhile,
due to change in the power balance caused by further
advancement of China, India and other countries, and
the relative change of the United States infl uence, the
international community is becoming increasingly
multi polarized.
Secondly, globalization and rapidly advanced
technological innovation have further expanded and
deepened mutual dependence among countries. As a
result, a confl ict or other security issue in a country or
region is likely to soon grow into a destabilizing factor
that could affect the entire international community.
In relation to this, the rapid spread of information
communication networks, such as the Internet and social
media that serve as a major factor behind globalization,
has greatly expanded the ability of non-state actors to
disseminate and mobilize their views and claims; and
in the process increased their infl uence over nations
and the international community. Examples include
the explosive propagation or spread of individual
criticism of nations or international terrorist groups
disseminating their extremist views, leading in some
cases to worldwide circulation.[1]

Given this situation, emerging global security
challenges include regional confl icts growing in
complexity, international terrorism becoming more
serious, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and
securing the stable use of new domains such as maritime
space, outer space, and cyber space.

**(1) Regional Confl ict and International Terrorism**
There are underlying differences in the nature of confl icts
occurring around the world. In the case of prolonged
confl icts, it is believed there is a rising possibility that
human rights violations, refugees, starvation, and poverty
occurring as a result of confl ict will affect a much broader
area than the countries involved. Furthermore, climate
change and competition to secure resources and energy
could become more tangible, and cause regional disputes.


They could become new factors that affect the global
security environment.
Amidst this backdrop, in the Middle East and
Africa, there are many examples where geographic blind
spots without government control in vulnerable nations
with unstable political situations and weak governance
capabilities have become a hotbed for the activities of
international terrorist organizations.[2]

Terrorist organizations are carrying out activities
across national borders while obtaining personnel,
weapons and fi nancial resources by taking advantage of
vulnerable border controls. Also, in European and North
American countries, there is growing concern over the
threat of terrorism posed by persons who sympathize with
extremist thoughts propagated by international terrorist
organizations or by persons returning to their home
country after fi ghting in confl ict zones. The extremist
organization ISIL has repeatedly cited that Japanese
nationals are a target of its terrorist attacks. Taking into
account that Japanese nationals died in the terrorist attack
on a restaurant in Dhaka, Bangladesh that occurred in
July 2016, the threat of international terrorism must be
considered a problem facing Japan, too.
In this manner, there is a growing risk that the impact
of regional confl ict and threat of terrorism will spread as
a factor of instability affecting the entire international
community, not just a single country or single region.
It is important for the international community to
review approaches to international frameworks and its
involvement based on the character of each and to seek
out appropriate responses. As for regional confl icts, the
mission of UN peacekeeping operations has expanded
to a wide range of fi elds including civilian and policing
activities: supervision of disarmament, security force
reforms, election and government monitoring, and
humanitarian assistance for refugee repatriation. In
particular, there is growing importance placed on
missions for protecting civilians and women and for
peace building. Additionally, there are examples in which
multinational forces and regional institutions authorized
by the UN Security Council are working to prevent
confl ict, maintain peace and build peace.


Controlling such actions is becoming more diffi cult even for authoritatian states with strong control of their people and for the international community working to contain the activities of terrorist
organizations. As a result, even authoritarian states have been forced to give more consideration than normal toward public opinion with regard to domestic governance and the management of
national politics. Also, for the international community, problems that should be resolved become more complicated, making it even more diffi cult to address them.

As noted above, the weakening of government structures can create a hotbed for the activities of international terrorist organizations and also make it more diffi cult to combat risks posed by the


-----

In terms of international counterterrorism, there is
growing importance for international cooperation due to
the spread of activities by terrorist organizations across
international borders. At present, in addition to the use
of military means, the entire international community
is working to block sources of fi nancing for terrorist
organizations and taking initiatives to prevent the
international transfer of terrorists.

**(2) Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction**
The proliferation of WMDs, such as nuclear, biological,
and chemical (NBC) weapons, and of ballistic missiles
that serve as the means of delivery of WMDs is still viewed
as a signifi cant threat to the international community,
including East Asia. As for chemical weapons, the
Malaysian police announced that VX, a chemical whose
production and use is banned under the Chemical Weapons
Convention (CWC), was detected from the body of Kim
Jong-nam following his assassination that occurred in
Malaysia in February 2017. Additionally, U.K. Prime
Minister Theresa May made a statement which says it is
clear that Novichok, a Russian-made military nerve agent,
was used. It is very likely that Russia is responsible for
the attack, with regard to the attack on a former Russian
intelligence agent that occurred in the United Kingdom
in February 2017. Concerning the situation in Syria, in
April 2017 the United States determined that the Assad
regime used chemical weapons in an attack on a region
controlled by anti-government forces in the south of
Idlib Governorate in northwest Syria, and in response
launched a missile strike on Shayrat Airbase, the base of
the planes used in the Assad regime’s attack and which is
believed to be housing chemical weapons. Furthermore,
in April 2018 the United States, United Kingdom and
France determined that the Assad regime used chemical
weapons against civilians once again in Eastern Ghouta
on the outskirts of Syria’s capital of Damascus, and in
response they launched a missile strike on three chemical
weapons-related facilities, demonstrating resolve to stop
the use and proliferation of chemical weapons.
In addition, there are continuing concerns about the
acquisition and use of WMDs by non-state actors, such
as international terrorist organizations. In this regard, the
international community continues to pursue efforts to
counter terrorism activities that utilize nuclear materials
and other radioactive substances.


the world, and there have been cases where countries
unilaterally assert their rights and take actions based on
their own assertion that is inconsistent with the existing
international order, thereby unduly infringing the
freedom of navigation on the high seas and of overfl ight.
China’s continued militarization such as large scale
and rapid land reclamation in the South China Sea,
and developing batteries and other military facilities
and various kinds of infrastructure that can be used
for military purposes constitutes acts that unilaterally
change the status quo and further advances its efforts to
create a fait accompli. In response to these situations,
the international community has been taking various
measures such as continuing to conduct antipiracy
operations in relevant waters including off the coast of
Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden, collaborating to protect
the existing international order based on law including
a free and open maritime order, and implementing
initiatives designed to avoid and prevent unintended
consequences in the maritime domain and airspace.

**(4) Cyberspace and Outer Space**
Recently, securing the stable use of new domains such as
outer space and cyberspace, in addition to the conventional
domains of the ground, sea and air, has become an
important challenge for the security of the international
community. The further advancement of military science
and technology along with signifi cant advancements in
Information and Communications Technology (ICT) has
increased the dependence of social infrastructure and
military activities on outer space and cyberspace. On the
other hand, the development of anti-satellite weapons by
countries and the diversifi cation of cyber attacks with
suspected government involvement have exacerbated the
risks to the stable use of outer space and cyberspace. In
recent years, countries are moving ahead with specifi c
efforts aimed at reinforcing a nation’s ability to combat
cyber attacks, including private sector companies, and
acquiring the capabilities to monitor threats to space
assets such as satellites. There are also moves seen in the
international community to promote the rule of law in
outer space and cyberspace by establishing certain codes
of conduct.


**(5) Technology**
Rapid advancements in technological innovation are
now spreading into military fi elds. Major powers such
as the United States, China and Russia are believed to
be focusing on research and development of precision
guided technologies, unmanned technologies, artifi cial
i t lli (AI) t h l i d t lth t h l i


**(3) Maritime Domain**
With regard to the maritime domain, which has been
regarded as a foundation for supporting international

among others. Such progress in military science and
technology relies heavily on the development of civilian
technologies. It is believed that the development and
international transfer of civilian technologies will
have a major impact on improvements in the military
capabilities of each country. Meanwhile, countries
without advanced technologies and non-state actors
appear set to develop and acquire means for asymmetrical
attack such as WMDs and cyber capabilities, along with
obtaining through illicit means the technologies of
developed countries. Such trends in the development of
military technologies are believed to have a signifi cant
impact on the military strategies of each country and the
power balance between countries.


As seen above, the international community today
faces complex, diverse, and broad security challenges
and destabilizing factors. Along with deterrence and
handling of armed confl icts, the roles of military forces
in responding to these challenges are becoming so
diverse that they include a broad spectrum of activities
from confl ict prevention to reconstruction assistance,
and military forces are now playing such important roles
more frequently. Meanwhile, for military forces to play
their roles, comprehensive responses are required that
combine military capacity with other capacities such as
diplomacy, law enforcement and justice, intelligence, and
the economy.

**Defense Policies of Countries**


**Section 1 The United States**


1 Security and Defense Policies

It has been pointed out that the Trump administration,
which was inaugurated in January 2017, has signifi cantly
changed the patterns of U.S. involvement in the world
amidst the formation of a new security environment,
including a shift in the global balance of power,
attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion in
Ukraine and the South China Sea, the development and
improved operational capability of North Korea’s nuclear
weapons and ballistic missiles which have become
an unprecedentedly serious and urgent threat, and the
intensifi cation of the activities of international terrorist
organizations. On the other hand, it can be considered that
while the United States is focusing on global competition,
the United States has been continuing to play a role for
world peace and stability with its comprehensive national
power, the largest in the world, based on its belief that the
values and infl uence of the United States, bolstered by
its power, would make the world freer, safer, and more
prosperous.
The Trump administration, under the “America
First” vision for governance, has set forth a policy for
rebuilding the U.S. Forces and placing importance on
allies under the banner of peace through strength. In
addition, in less than a year since the inauguration, the
Trump administration unveiled its policies on security
and national defense by publishing the National Security
Strategy (NSS),[1] followed by the National Defense
Strategy (NDS)[2] and the National Posture Review (NPR).
Regarding regional security, the United States has
clarifi ed its stance that it will emphasize the security
of the Indo-Pacifi c region. In particular, under the
recognition that North Korea’s nuclear capacity is an

Services on the National Defense Strategy and Nuclear Posture Review on February 6, 2018.

urgent, unpredictable threat to the United States and
its allies, it has maintained sanctions and continues its
efforts to pursue the complete denuclearization of North
Korea. In addition, taking into account China’s current
movements in the South China Sea, the United States
has expressed its stance that it will continue “Freedom of
Navigation Operations,” and during his November 2017
trip to Asia, President Trump emphasized the importance
of freedom of navigation when he revealed the vision for
a “Free and Open Indo-Pacifi c” (see 1-3 of this Section).
The United States has also been dealing with security
issues outside of the Indo-Pacifi c region. In response
to the offensive from the Islamic State of Iraq and the
Levant (ISIL) and other organizations in Iraq and Syria
since 2014, the United States, since August 2014, has led

Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR), a military operation
against ISIL that includes airstrikes. In addition, following
its assessment that the Assad administration of Syria had
used chemical weapons in April 2018, together with the
United Kingdom and France, the United States carried out
missile strikes[3] against Syria’s chemical weapons-related
facilities, and clarifi ed its stance of developing powerful
deterrence against the production, proliferation, and use of
weapons of mass destruction. In August 2017, the United
States announced its strategy on Afghanistan and South
Asia which made clear its continuous involvement with
Afghanistan, and in September 2017, Defense Secretary
Mattis disclosed that reinforcements of over 3,000 U.S.
military personnel would be sent to Afghanistan. In
light of Russian actions concerning Ukraine, in order to
strengthen involvement in NATO security and deterrence,
the investment for the European Deterrence Initiative[4] is
being increased from US$4.8 billion in the previous fi scal
year to US$6.5 billion in the FY2019 Department of
Defense budget request. On the other hand, in its security
policies, the United States considers that certain allies
which are pointed out as bearing only a small burden
of cost and enjoying security guaranteed by the United
States should shoulder their fair share of responsibility.
Under such a perception, the United States has requested
NATO member states to swiftly meet their commitments
to increase their national defense spending to 2% of GDP.
One year has passed since the inauguration of the
Trump administration, and amidst the indicated direction
of security and defense policies in strategies such as the
NSS, specifi c security and defense policy trends advanced
under the aforementioned strategy will draw attention.
In addition, it should also be noted how the changing
situations in the Asia-Pacifi c region, the Middle East and
the EU, as well as the November 2018 mid-term election,
will affect the U.S. security and defense policies.


states that are attempting to revise key aspects of the
international order and are acting in a manner that
threatens U.S. national security interests. It also mentions
that violent extremist organizations such as ISIL are
becoming imminent threats.
On the other hand, the NSS released in December
2017 indicates that changes in a regional balance of power
can have global consequences and threaten U.S. interests.
It mentions the three main sets of challengers against the
United States and its allies and partners, which are the
“revisionist powers” of China and Russia, the “rogue
states” of Iran and North Korea, and transnational threat
organizations, including jihadist terrorist groups. Of
these, China and Russia are said to challenge American
power, infl uence, and interests and attempt to erode
American safety and prosperity, while North Korea and
Iran destabilize regions and threaten the United States
and its allies.
In addition, the NDS published in January 2018
points out that the primary concern in U.S. security is not
terrorism but rather long-term strategic competition with
China and Russia. It also mentions that China and Russia
are undermining the free and open international order
constructed by the United States and its allies, and it is
increasingly clear that China and Russia want to shape a
world consistent with their authoritarian model.
Furthermore, regarding the military actions carried
out in Syria in April 2018, President Trump stated that
establishing strong deterrence against the production,
proliferation, and use of chemical weapons is an important
interest for the national security of the United States.
In consideration of this recognition, the United
States deems as security threats nations and organizations
that attempt to undermine the interests of itself and its
allies and threaten the international order. While the
Trump administration has fundamentally accepted the
threat perception of the previous Obama administration,
it is addressing threats posed by China and Russia with
particular emphasis as priority issues and appears to be
continuing a policy of dealing with threats posed by North
Korea, Iran, radical terrorist groups, and production,
proliferation, and use of weapons of mass destruction.

At 21:00 on April 13 Eastern Standard Time (10:00 on April 14 Japan time), the United States together with France and the United Kingdom conducted strikes against three chemical weapons-related
facilities of the Syrian administration. The U.S. Department of Defense announced that it believed that all 105 cruise missiles used hit their targets. Of these, the U.S. Forces fi red 30 tomahawk missiles
from two destroyers, 30 missiles from one cruiser, and six missiles from one nuclear submarine, as well as 19 JASSMs from two B-1B strategic bombers.

This initiative reassures allies and partners of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) that the United States is committed to their security and territorial integrity by increasing the presence of
the U.S. Forces in Europe, conducting further bilateral and multilateral training and exercises with NATO allies and other countries, and strengthening the prepositioning of U.S. equipment in Europe.

by a major power and deter opportunistic aggression
elsewhere, it advances building fl exible theater postures
and force deployment that have mobility, resilience,
and modernize key capabilities such as nuclear forces,
space and cyberspace, C4ISR, missile defense, advanced
autonomous systems, etc. Further, although indicating its
commitment to deter aggression, it also demonstrates the
stance that dynamic military force employment, military
posture, and operations must introduce unpredictability
to adversary decision-makers. For 2. Strengthening
alliances, the following three matters are emphasized:
i. Uphold a foundation of mutual respect, responsibility,
priorities, and accountability, ii. Expand regional
consultative mechanisms and collaborative planning,
and iii. Deepen interoperability. On the other hand, there
are expectations that allies and partners contribute an
equitable share to mutually benefi cial collective security,
including effective investment in modernizing their
defense capabilities.


2 Security and National Defense Strategy


The NSS developed by President Trump is rooted in the
America First policy and realism in which power plays a
central role in international politics, and stresses the need
to rethink the policies of the past 20 years that were based
on the assumption that engagement with rivals and their
inclusion in the international community would turn them
into benign actors and trustworthy partners. Moreover, the
NSS sets up a strategic policy to protect four vital interests
in this competitive world: 1. Protect the American people,
the homeland, and the American way of life, 2. Promote
American prosperity, 3. Preserve peace through strength,
and 4. Advance American infl uence.
Furthermore, in addition to rebuilding the U.S.
military to the strongest armed forces and strengthening
capabilities in many areas including space and
cyberspace, the United States is also striving to leverage
the balance of power in the Indo-Pacifi c, Europe, and
the Middle East. Moreover, while recognizing that allies
and partners are a great strength of the United States
and close cooperation is necessary, the United States
has demanded that its allies and partners demonstrate
the will to confront shared threats and contribute the
capabilities. It is also pointed out that although the United
States is responding to the growing political, economic,
and military competition throughout the world, by
ensuring American military power is second to none and
fully integrating with its allies all instruments of power,
the United States will seek areas of cooperation with
competitors from a position of strength.
The NDS drawn up by Secretary of Defense Mattis
based on the NSS considers the long-term competitions
with China and Russia as the principal priorities of
the Department of Defense because of the magnitude
of the threats they pose to U.S. security and prosperity
and the potential for the threats to increase. Moreover,
to expand the competitive space, the following three
lines of effort are raised: 1. Building a more lethal Joint
Force, 2. Strengthening alliances and attracting new
partners, 3. Reforming the Department of Defense for
greater performance and affordability.
Among these, 1. Building military power prioritizes
preparedness for war and in order to defeat aggression


3 Involvement in the Indo-Pacifi c Region


While the Trump administration has stopped using the
key phrase “rebalancing to the Asia-Pacifi c region” set
forth by the Obama administration, it has shown a stance
of placing importance on the region through the United
States’ commitment to the region and strengthening its
presence since the inauguration of the administration.[5]
In particular, under the policy to continue sustaining
maximum pressure on North Korea, which is continuing
its nuclear and ballistic missile development, the Trump

At the Japan-U.S. Defense Ministers’ Meeting on February 4, 2017, U.S. Secretary of Defense Mattis who was visiting Japan at the very early timing of just two weeks after the inauguration of the
new Trump administration, emphasized that the Asia-Pacifi c region remains a top priority for the United States and that the United States would strengthen its commitment by maintaining the presence
of the U.S. Forces in the region. Also, at the Shangri-La Dialogue in June 2017, he stated that the Asia-Pacifi c region is positioned as a priority region and that the United States would strengthen
alliances, empower regional countries, and strengthen the U.S. Forces capabilities in the region. He also stated 60% of all U.S. naval warships, 55% of the army, and about two thirds of the Fleet

administration is exhibiting its recognition that a military
option plays an important role in backing up diplomatic
efforts, and also is clearly showing its readiness to
respond with overwhelming power in retaliation to any
attack by North Korea.
To show military presence against North Korea,
following on from the deployment in the Sea of Japan of
two carrier strike groups, the Carl Vinson Strike Group
and the USS Ronald Reagan Strike Group in June 2017,
three carrier strike groups, the USS Ronald Reagan, USS
Theodore Roosevelt and USS Nimitz strike groups were
deployed in the Sea of Japan in November 2017. The
nuclear submarines USS Tucson and USS Michigan also
made port calls in the ROK in October 2017. In addition,
during the joint U.S.-ROK regularly-held aviation
exercise Vigilant Ace in December 2017, F-22 and F-35
aircraft participated for the fi rst time ever in the exercise.
Furthermore, between May and December 2017, B-1B
strategic bombers fl ew over the Korean Peninsula every
month. In addition, following the deployment of 62
launchers of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense
(THAAD) system[6] by the U.S. Forces in the ROK in April
2017, in September 2017 four launchers were added and
a total of six sites commenced operation.
In March 2018, responding to North Korea’s
statement of intent for denuclearization and other
developments, President Trump indicated his forwardlooking intent to hold a U.S.-North Korea Summit
Meeting, which resulted in the holding of the fi rst-ever
historic summit on June 12, 2018. Both leaders clearly
indicated willingness for jointly making efforts to build a
lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula,
and based on the reaffi rmed commitment expressed by
Chairman Kim toward complete denuclearization of the
Korean Peninsula, both leaders confi rmed that followon negotiations would continue. Responding to this
discussion, on June 18 and 22, 2018, the U.S. Department
of Defense announced the suspension of all planning for
the U.S.-ROK command and control exercise UlchiFreedom Guardian scheduled for August, and two the
Korean Marine Exchange Program[7] training exercises
scheduled to occur in the following three months.
Regarding this point, at the joint press conference
following the Japan-U.S. Defense Ministers’ Meeting


held on June 29, Secretary of Defense Mattis stated that
the decision was taken to create space for their diplomats
to negotiate strongly, and increasing the prospects for a
peaceful solution on the Korean Peninsula, and that the
United States maintains a strong, collaborative defensive
stance to ensure its diplomats continue to negotiate from
a position of unquestioned strength. On the other hand,
the United States showed a clear stance that it would
maintain sanctions until North Korea took concrete,
verifi able measures for ending its nuclear development,
and that it would keep the U.S. Forces in the ROK. (See
1-5 of Section 2.)
During his November 2017 trip to Asia, in
consonance with Japan’s “Free and Open Indo-Pacifi c
Strategy,” President Trump expressed his intention to
emphasize compliance with principles such as respecting
the rule of law and freedom of navigation, and that he
would promote a free and open Indo-Pacifi c region, as
well as strengthen alliances in the region.
In relation to this, the NSS emphasizes that China
seeks to displace the United States in the Indo-Pacifi c
region and reorder the region in its favor, as well as having
mounted a rapid military modernization campaign to
limit U.S. access to the region and to provide itself a freer
hand there. Moreover, as part of its Indo-Pacifi c region
strategy, while reinforcing its commitment to freedom
of the seas and the peaceful resolution of territorial and
maritime disputes in accordance with international law,
the United States will seek to increase quadrilateral
cooperation with Japan, Australia, and India and develop
a strong defense networks with its allies and partners.
In the same way, the NDS points out that China is
leveraging military modernization, infl uence operations,
and predatory economics to coerce neighboring countries
to reorder the Indo-Pacifi c region to their advantage and
is seeking regional hegemony. It emphasizes that a free
and open Indo-Pacifi c provides prosperity and security,
and that the United States will strengthen its alliances and
partnerships in the Indo-Pacifi c to a networked security
architecture capable of deterring aggression, maintaining
stability, and ensuring free access to common domains.
Furthermore, regarding China’s maritime expansion,
at the Shangri-La Dialogue in June 2017, Secretary of
Defense Mattis stated that the scope and effect of China’s


A ballistic missile defense system that intercepts short- and medium-range ballistic missiles in the terminal phase from the ground. It tracks and intercepts targets at high altitude in the upper
atmosphere or beyond the atmosphere. See Part III, Chapter 1, Section 2 for ballistic missile defense systems.

construction activities in the South China Sea differ from
those in other countries in several key ways, including
the nature of its militarization, China’s disregard for
international law, its contempt for other nations’ interests,
and its efforts to dismiss non-adversarial resolution of
issues; and that the United States cannot and will not
accept unilateral coercive changes to the status quo.
Moreover, while committing to protecting the rights,
freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea, and the ability of
all countries to exercise those rights in the strategically
important East and South China Sea, Secretary of
Defense Mattis stated that the United States would
continue to fl y, sail, and operate wherever international
law allows, and demonstrate resolve through operational
presence in the South China Sea and beyond. It is
reported that in May, July, August, and October 2017, as
well as January, March, and May 2018, the U.S. Forces
conducted Freedom of Navigation Operations within
12 nautical miles of the islands and reefs in the South
China Sea that are claimed by China.[8] Also, in May 2018,
the U.S. Department of Defense stated that China had
deployed anti-ship missiles and surface-to-air missiles
to the features in the Spratly Islands, and pointed out
that the placement of these weapon system was only
military use. As an initial response to China’s continued
militarization of areas in the South China Sea, the United
States disinvited the Chinese navy to the multilateral Rim
of the Pacifi c Exercise (RIMPAC) in 2018.
Based on such a perception of China and regional
strategy, it can be considered that the United States is
advancing efforts rooted in the concept of free and open
Indo-Pacifi c region.
In addition, as part of its activities around
strengthening its presence in the Indo-Pacifi c region, in
January 2017, the U.S. Forces deployed Marine Corps
specifi cation F-35B fi ghters to MCAS Iwakuni. In
October 2017, 12 Air Force specifi ed F-35A fi ghters were
deployed at Kadena Air Force Base for the fi rst time ever
in the Asia-Pacifi c region. Also, in January 2018, nuclearcapable B-2 bombers and B-52 bombers were deployed


to Guam, and in place of the amphibious assault ship USS
Bonhomme Richard, the amphibious assault ship USS
Wasp that is capable of carrying F-35B fi ghters arrived in
Sasebo. Furthermore, in March 2018 the aircraft carrier
USS Carl Vinson made the fi rst port call by a U.S. aircraft
carrier in over 40 years in Vietnam.

4 Innovation Initiatives in the National Defense Field


In November 2014, then-Secretary of Defense Hagel
announced the Defense Innovation Initiative (DII) that
aimed to achieve military superiority through innovation,
and stated the expectation that this would develop into
the Third Offset Strategy.[9] Also, in 2015 as a part of DII,
then-Secretary of Defense Carter established Defense
Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) in Silicon Valley
to be a bridge between the Department of Defense and
civilian groups, in order to introduce innovative civilian
technologies into military fi elds.
The Trump administration stopped using the
names DII and Third Offset Strategy, but in August
2017 Secretary of Defense Mattis visited DIUx and IT
companies and discussed utilization methods of new
technologies for the Department of Defense. To the
accompanying press corps, he stated that Department of
Defense innovation initiatives are a matter of maximum
priority and pointed out the importance of DIUx. Also,
the NSS outlines a policy that the United States must
harness innovative technologies that are being developed
outside of the traditional defense industrial base. The
NDS also states that the Department of Defense needs
innovation to surpass revisionist powers, and calls for
extensive investment in military application of autonomy,
artifi cial intelligence, and machine learning, including
rapid application of commercial breakthroughs, to
gain competitive military advantages. In view of these
circumstances, it can be considered that the United States
will continue to place emphasis on innovation in the
national defense fi eld.


It is regarded that the Trump administration implemented the following Freedom of Navigation Operations: within 12 nautical miles of Mischief Reef of the Spratly Islands by the destroyer USS Dewey
in May 2017, within 12 nautical miles of Triton Island of the Paracel Islands by the destroyer USS Stethem in July 2017, within 12 nautical miles of Mischief Reef of the Spratly Islands by the destroyer
USS John S. McCain in August 2017, surrounding the Paracel Islands by the destroyer USS Chafee in October 2017, within 12 nautical miles of Scarborough Shoal by the destroyer USS Hopper in
January 2018, within 12 nautical miles of Mischief Reef by the destroyer USS Mustin in March 2018, within 12 nautical miles of the Paracel Islands by the destroyer USS Higgins and the cruiser USS
Antietam in May 2018.
The Obama administration implemented the following Freedom of Navigation Operations: within 12 nautical miles of Subi Reef of the Spratly Islands by the destroyer USS Lassen in October 2015,
within 12 nautical miles of Triton Island of the Paracel Islands by the destroyer USS Curtis Wilbur in January 2016, within 12 nautical miles of Fiery Cross Reef of the Paracel Islands by the destroyer
USS William P. Lawrence in May 2016, and surrounding the Paracel Islands by the destroyer USS Decatur in October 2016.

The United States’ Third Offset Strategy is based on the concept of offsetting the capacity of the adversary by acquiring asymmetrical means that differ from the capacity of the adversary. There were


-----

technologies, as well as incorporate nuclear capability
onto the forward-deployable, nuclear-capable F-35
as a replacement for the current aging dual-capable
aircraft (DCA). Also, the United States has shown its
commitment to extended deterrence for its allies and, if
necessary, maintaining the forward-deployed capability
with DCA and nuclear weapons in regions outside
Europe, including Northeast Asia.
On the other hand, there has not yet been an offi cial
announcement on the Ballistic Missile Defense Review
(BMDR) that President Trump had directed to be
formulated alongside the NPR. Regarding this, in March
2018, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy John Rood
testifi ed in Congress regarding missile defense that while
the review work was still being advanced, the new review
would be decided on as the Missile Defense Review
(MDR) based on the existing threats of missile strikes
by cruise missiles and hypersonic glide vehicles, other
than ballistic missiles. Moreover, in order to deal with
threats to the U.S. mainland by rogue nation missiles,
he set forth strengthening the mainland’s missile
defense through additional deployment of 20 groundbased interceptor missiles, strengthening the capability
of ground-based interceptor missiles by Redesigned
Kill Vehicles (RKV),[12] and deployment of new missile
tracking and identifi cation sensors in Alaska, Hawaii,
and the Pacifi c. Regarding missile defense in Europe, the
Middle East, and the Indo-Pacifi c region, he mentioned
strengthening readiness through additional deployment
of Patriot missiles, THAAD, and SM-3. Also, together
with ensuring the missile defense capabilities of allies
and partners, he also indicated a policy to strengthen
cooperation for improving interoperability with the U.S.
missile defense system. Furthermore, regarding advanced
technologies, he stressed commitment in such areas as
improving identifi cation capability of missile defense
system sensors, boost phase missile interception lasers,
new sensors deployed in space, and Multi-Object Kill
Vehicles (MOKV).[13]


5 Nuclear and Missile Defense Policy


The NPR released in February 2018 stated that, although
the United States had reduced the role and number of
nuclear weapons based on the aspiration that if the United
States took the lead in reducing nuclear arms, other
states would follow, the global threat conditions have
worsened markedly since the most recent NPR[10] released
in 2010 and there now exist unprecedented threats and
uncertainty, as China and Russia have expanded their
nuclear forces and North Korea continues its pursuit of
nuclear weapons and missile capabilities. Given these
circumstances, the following were raised as the roles of
U.S. nuclear forces: 1. Deterrence of nuclear and nonnuclear attacks, 2. Assurance of allies and partners, 3.
Achievement of U.S. objectives if deterrence fails, and 4.
Capacity to hedge against an uncertain future.
Also, while the United States would only consider
the employment of nuclear weapons in extreme
circumstances to defend the vital interests of the United
States, its allies, and partners, the NPR clearly states
that extreme circumstances could include signifi cant
non-nuclear strategic attacks against the United States
and its allies, and a “no fi rst use” policy is not justifi ed
today. It also indicates that the United States remains
the policy to retain some ambiguity regarding the
precise circumstances that might lead to a U.S. nuclear
response. Furthermore, it also revealed that the United
States would apply a tailored approach to deter across
a spectrum of adversaries, threats and contexts, and in
addition to that, it would ensure effective deterrence
by enhancing the fl exibility and range of its nuclear
capabilities through nuclear modernization and the
development and deployment of new capabilities.
Specifi cally, in addition to sustaining and replacing the
nuclear triad,[11] as new capabilities, in the near-term, the
United States would modify a small number of existing
SLBM warheads to provide a low-yield option, and in
the longer term, pursue a modern nuclear-armed sealaunched cruise missile (SLCM), leveraging existing


10 The NPR released in 2010 called for a world without nuclear weapons, with goals that included reducing the role of the U.S.’s nuclear weapons and maintaining strategic deterrence and stability at
reduced nuclear force levels.

11 The nuclear triad consists of Minuteman III ICBM, Ballistic Missile Submarines (SSBN) armed with Trident II D5 SLBM, and strategic bombers B-52 and B-2.

12 The RKV is an improved counterattack vehicle in terms of reliability, manufacture, examination, and cost effi ciency.

13 Together with increasing object identifi cation capability, the MOKV development program improves interceptor missile performance by developing the capability to destroy multiple objects through

military end strength and procurement were represented
in the FY2019 budget request, such as securing 1,338,100
personnel, adding 24,100 more troops to the services’
end strength, and procuring 135 upgraded M-1 tanks
(56 tanks in the previous year), 10 battleships (8 in the
previous year), and 77 F-35 fi ghters (70 in the previous
year). In addition, regarding ballistic missile defense,
additional deployment of 20 ground-based interceptor
missiles in Alaska, other than 40 missiles in Alaska and 4
missiles in California, are to be completed by the end of
2023, in light of the threat of the ICBMs posed by North
Korea and Iran.
In January 2018, Secretary of Defense Mattis pointed
out that the U.S. military competitive edge has eroded in
every domain of warfare and that the defense expenditure
cap was causing a negative effect. He stated that there
was a need for a stable, predictable budget, and that while
both capability and capacity are important for building
the military, currently, building the capacity is being
emphasized. For this, the Trump administration can be
considered to be pursuing ensuring a suffi cient and stable
defense budget, emphasizing keeping a force of suffi cient
size in the short-term, and aiming for a budgetary measures
to expand capability in the mid- and long-term.

[See] Fig. I-2-1-1 (Changes in the U.S. Defense Budget)


6 FY2019 Budget


As the budget defi cit of the U.S. Government is
deepening in recent years, the Budget Control Act
enacted in August 2011 stipulated a signifi cant cut in
government spending by FY2021.[14] Also, in March
2013, the sequestration of government spending
including defense expenditure was started based on
the provisions of the Budget Control Act. However,
after this, sequestration was eased for the budgets from
FY2014-FY2017 due to the bipartisan acts passed
twice.[15] Furthermore, amid the Trump administration’s
policy to end the sequestration of defense spending in
order to rebuild the U.S. military, the Bipartisan Budget
Act was passed in February 2018, and a defense budget
framework was approved that drastically raised the limit
set by the sequestration for FY2018 and 2019.[16]

In these circumstances, the defense budget request in
the Budget Blueprint submitted to Congress in February
2018 allocated US$617.0 billion for the base budget,[17]
representing about a 7% increase over the previous
year. For the overseas contingency operations budget, a
total of US$69.0 billion would be appropriated per the
request, including budget escalation in the OIR and the
European Deterrence Initiative.[18] Also, the goals for


14 In January 2012, the Department of Defense announced that the specifi c national defense annual expenditure reduction based on the enacted act would amount to roughly US$487 billion over the
10 year period between FY2012 and FY2021 (roughly US$259 billion during the fi ve year period between FY2013 and FY2017).

15 Through the passing of the 2013 Non-Partisan Budget Act, the national defense budget limit was lowered by US$22 billion and US$9 billion in FY2014 and FY2015 respectively. Through the passing
of the 2015 Non-Partisan Budget Act, the national defense budget limit was raised to US$25 billion and US$15 billion in FY2016 and FY2017 respectively.

16 Through the passing of the 2018 Non-Partisan Budget Act, the national defense budget limit was raised to US$80 billion and US$85 billion in FY2018 and FY2019 respectively.

17 An increase of about US$35 billion from the FY2018 enacted budget level.

18 The total sum of the FY2019 national defense budget request was roughly US$716.0 billion, including defense-related budget requests from other departments of roughly US$30 billion (such as the

2 Military Posture


The U.S. maritime forces have about 940 vessels
(including about 70 submarines) totaling about 6.36
million tons. The 6th Fleet is responsible for the East
Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, and Africa; the 5th
Fleet in the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, and the northwest
Indian Ocean; the 3rd Fleet in the eastern Pacifi c; the 4th
Fleet in South America and the Caribbean Sea; and the
7th Fleet in the western Pacifi c and the Indian Ocean.
The U.S. air forces have roughly 3,570 combat
aircraft across the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. In
addition to carrier-based aircraft deployed at sea, part of
the tactical air force is forward-deployed in Germany, the
United Kingdom, Japan, and the ROK.
In regard to strategic offensive weapons including
nuclear force, the United States under the former Obama
administration proceeded with its reduction based on a
new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty that came into force
in February 2011. In February 2018, it announced that
its deployed strategic warheads[19] stood at 1,350, while its
deployed delivery platforms stood at 652.[20] The United
States is studying the concept of a Conventional Prompt
Global Strike (CPGS), as an effort contributing to the
nation’s new ability to reduce reliance on nuclear weapons.[21]

Moreover, in addressing the increasing threats in
cyberspace, the U.S. Cyber Command was founded
in order to oversee operations in cyberspace. The U.S.
Cyber Command achieved Initial Operational Capability
(IOC) in May 2010 and commended full capability in
November in the same year. Furthermore, in May 2018,
the Cyber Command, which was previously a subunifi ed
command under U.S. Strategic Command, was elevated
to a unifi ed combatant command.[22]

Also, in June 2018, President Trump instructed the
Department of Defense to immediately start the necessary
processes to establish the Space Force as the sixth branch
of the Armed Forces.

[See] Fig. I-2-1-2 (Structure of the Unifi ed Combatant Command)


1 General Situation

The operation of the U.S. Forces is not controlled by the
individual branches of the broader armed forces, rather it
is operated under the command of the Unifi ed Combatant
Commands, composed of forces from multiple branches
of the armed forces. The Unifi ed Combatant Commands
consist of three commands with functional responsibilities
and six commands with regional responsibilities. Of
these, Secretary of Defense Mattis announced that the
name of the Pacifi c Command would be changed to the
Indo-Pacifi c Command in May 2018.
The U.S. ground forces have about 470,000 Army
soldiers and about 180,000 Marines, which are forwarddeployed in Germany, the ROK, and Japan, among
other countries. Along with a shift from the Obama
administration’s policy reducing soldiers to a policy of
increasing them, in order to deter enemies and achieve
battle victories when necessary, the Army has been
making efforts to maintain the world’s leading ground
force capability through necessary investment in ensuring
readiness. The Marine Corps aims to acquire forces
capable of responding to any threat as a “middleweight
force,” bridging the seam between smaller special
operations forces and larger heavy conventional forces.

2 Current Military Posture in the Asia-Pacifi c Region


The United States, a Pacifi c nation, continues to play an
important role in ensuring the peace and stability of the
Asia-Pacifi c region by placing the Indo-Pacifi c Command,
a combatant command integrating the Army, Navy, Air
Force and Marine Corps in the region. The Indo-Pacifi c
Command is a geographic combatant command which
is responsible for the largest geographical area, and its
subordinate unifi ed commands include U.S. Forces Japan
and U.S. Forces Korea. In order to broaden the perspective
of the U.S. Forces and promote better understanding of
the U.S. Forces from allies, the Indo-Pacifi c Command
headquarters accept personnel from allies in the region.
Under this scheme, personnel from Canada and Australia
are currently serving in the Indo-Pacifi c Command as
deputy director level-offi cials.
The Indo-Pacifi c Command consists of the U.S.
Army Pacifi c, U.S. Pacifi c Fleet, U.S. Marine Corps
Forces Pacifi c, and U.S. Pacifi c Air Forces,[23] which are
all headquartered in Hawaii.
The Army Pacifi c’s subordinate commands include
the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii, the 8th U.S. Army in
the ROK, which is the Army component of the U.S. Forces
in the ROK, and the U.S. Army Alaska. Additionally, the
Army Pacifi c assigns approximately 2,600 personnel to
commands in Japan, such as I Corps (Forward) and the

**Section 2 Korean Peninsula**


On the Korean Peninsula, people of the same ethnicity
have been divided into two—north and south—for more
than half a century. Even today, the ROK and North Korea
pit their ground forces of about 1.6 million against each
other across the demilitarized zone (DMZ).


Peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula under
such security environment is an extremely important
challenge not only to Japan but also to the entire region
of East Asia.

ballistic missiles and the enhancement of its operation
capabilities, including conducting six nuclear tests so far
and repeatedly launching as many as 40 ballistic missiles
since 2016, and by maintaining and strengthening largescale special operations forces. In addition, North Korea
repeatedly uses provocative rhetoric and behavior against
relevant countries, including Japan.[5]

Such military trends in North Korea pose an
unprecedentedly serious and imminent threat to the
security of Japan and seriously undermine the peace and
security of the region and the international community.
Needless to say, North Korea’s possession of nuclear
weapons cannot be tolerated. At the same time, suffi cient
attention needs to be paid to the development and
deployment of ballistic missiles, the military confrontation
on the Korean Peninsula, and the proliferation of WMDs
and ballistic missiles by North Korea.

**[KEY WORD]**


Ballistic missiles


1 General Situation

North Korea has been advocating the building of a
strong socialist state in all areas—ideology, politics,
military affairs, and economy,[1] and it adopts “militaryfi rst (Songun) politics” to realize this goal. “Militaryfi rst (Songun) politics” has been defi ned as a basic form
of socialist politics that leads the great undertaking of
socialism to victory by giving priority to the military
forces in all activities under the principle of military
fi rst, and strengthening and relying on the actors in the
revolution with the Korean People’s Army (KPA) acting
as the central and main force.[2] In fact, leader Kim Jong-un,
Chairman of the State Affairs Commission,[3] who is in a
position to control the military, noted the importance of
military power: “It is necessary to uphold the militaryfi rst revolutionary path as the constant strategic path,
and strengthen the might of the military power in all
of its dimensions.”[4] He also regularly visits military
organizations. In this light, it is conceivable that the
Chairman will continue to attach importance to and rely
on the military forces.
Although North Korea has been facing serious
economic diffi culties and has depended on the international
community for food and other resources, it seems to be
maintaining and enhancing its military capabilities and
combat readiness by preferentially allocating resources
to its military forces. North Korea deploys most of its
military forces along the DMZ. According to the offi cial
announcement at the Supreme People’s Assembly in
April 2018, the proportion of the defense budget in
the FY2017 national budget was 15.9%. However, it is
believed that this represents only a fraction of the real
defense expenditures.
Furthermore, North Korea seems to maintain and
reinforce its so-called asymmetric military capabilities
by continuing to promote the development of WMDs and


A ballistic missile is a rocket engine-propelled missile that fl ies on a

parabolic trajectory. It is capable of attacking distant targets. Ballistic

missiles are generally categorized according to the following table.

|Category|Range|
|---|---|
|Short-Range Ballistic Missile (SRBM)|Under approx. 1,000 km or less|
|Medium-Range Ballistic Missile (MRBM)|Approx. 1,000 km – Under approx. 3,000 km|
|Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM)|Approx. 3,000 km – Under approx. 5,500 km|
|Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM)|Approx. 5,500 km or more|



Ballistic missiles launched from submarines are collectively referred

to as submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), while a ballistic

missile that has a precision guidance system on its warhead necessary
to attack aircraft carriers and other vessels is called an anti-ship

ballistic missile (ASBM).


North Korea used to insist that it would open the door to a “powerful and prosperous nation (Kangseong Daeguk)” in 2012, which marked the 100th anniversary of the birth of the late President Kim
Il-sung. Recently, however, North Korea has been using mainly the expression, “powerful and prosperous country (Kangseong Kukka).”

Written decision of the Seventh Congress of the Korean Workers’ Party, “Report on the Work of the KWP Central Committee” (May 8, 2016).

At the Supreme People’s Assembly in June 2016, the National Defense Commission was renamed the State Affairs Commission, presided over by Chairman Kim Jong-un. For consistency purposes
“Chairman of the State Affairs Commission” is used for the title of Kim Jong-un in this white paper.

“Report on the Work of the Korean Workers’ Party (KWP) Central Committee” at the Seventh Congress of the KWP in May 2016.

In particular, from March to April 2013, North Korea underscored that it would exercise its right to preemptive nuclear attack against the United States and other countries, and that the strike zone of
its ballistic missiles included Japan, naming specifi c cities. For example, it has stated that “not only Yokosuka, Misawa, Okinawa, and Guam but also the U.S. mainland are within our range” (March
31, 2013, Rodong Sinmun), “none of Japan’s territories shall be spared from being the target of our retaliatory attack (listing the names of Tokyo, Osaka, Yokohama, Nagoya, and Kyoto in this context)”
(April 10, 2013, Rodong Sinmun), etc. More recently, the Korean Central Broadcasting Station stated on September 13, 2017, that, “the Japanese archipelago will be sunk into the sea by a nuclear
bomb,” and the October 9 edition of the Rodong Sinmun stated that, “If the fl ames of war break out on the Korean Peninsula, Japan can never be safe. Everything in Japan that is mobilized for war

Partly because North Korea maintains its extremely details and intentions of its behavior. However, it is
closed regime, it is diffi cult to accurately capture the necessary for Japan to pay utmost attention to them.


Commentary View of North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missiles **COLUMN**

North Korea has conducted three nuclear tests and launched 40 ballistic missiles since 2016. During 2017, it carried out a nuclear
test with an estimated yield roughly 10 times the scale of the Hiroshima-type atomic bomb, launched a new intercontinental-range
ballistic missile into Japan’s EEZ, and launched two ballistic missiles that fl ew over Japan. These military developments by North
Korea pose an unprecedentedly serious and imminent threat to Japan’s security and undermine peace and security of the region
and the international community.
Kim Jong-un, Chairman of the State Affairs Commission, expressed interest in North-South dialogue in his New Year’s
address given on January 1, 2018. This was followed by a summit meeting between the Republic of Korea and North Korea in
April 2018 at which Chairman Kim Jong-un expressed his intention to work toward denuclearization. Furthermore, at the United
States-North Korea summit meeting held in June 2018, North Korea has made clear its intention to work toward the complete
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and confi rmed that negotiations would continue with the United States. It is signifi cant
that Chairman Kim Jong-un has made another clear promise in a written document to work toward the complete denuclearization
of the Korean Peninsula.
It is important to carefully assess specifi c actions by North Korea to dismantle nuclear and missile capabilities.
At the same time, taking into consideration the fact that North korea possesses and deploys several hundred Nodong missiles
capable of reaching almost every part of Japan as well as advancements in the development and operational capabilities of nuclear
weapons and missiles through repeated nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches to date, etc., there is no change in our basic
recognition concerning the threat of North Korea's nuclear weapons and missiles.
The Ministry of Defense and Self Defense Forces continue to do their utmost in gathering intelligence, monitoring the situation,
and implementing other activities to be ready for any circumstances, while also collaborating closely with the United States and
Republic of Korea, in order to carry out the responsibility of protecting the lives and peaceful existence of the Japanese population.

missile craft. Also, it has about 20 of the former model
Romeo-class submarines, about 70 midget submarines,
and about 140 air cushioned landing crafts, the latter
two of which are believed to be used for infi ltration and
transportation of the special operations forces. The Air
Force has approximately 550 combat aircraft, most of
which are out-of-date models made in China or the former
Soviet Union. However, some fourth-generation aircraft
such as MiG-29 fi ghters and Su-25 attack aircraft are also
included. North Korea has a large number of outdated
An-2 transport aircraft as well, which are believed to be
used for transportation of special operations forces. In
addition, North Korea has so-called asymmetric military
capabilities, namely, special operations force whose
size is estimated at 100,000 personnel.[8] In recent years,
North Korea is seen to be placing importance on and
strengthening its cyber forces.[9]

3 WMD and Ballistic Missiles


While North Korea continues to maintain largescale
military capabilities, its conventional forces are
considerably inferior to those of the ROK and the U.S.
Forces Korea. This is the result of a variety of factors,
including decreases in military assistance from the
former Soviet Union due to the collapse of the Cold War
regime, limitations placed on North Korea’s national
defense spending due to its economic stagnation, and the
rapid modernization of the ROK’s defense capabilities. It
is thus speculated that North Korea is focusing its efforts
on WMD and ballistic missile reinforcements in order to
compensate for this shortfall.
North Korea’s development of WMDs and missiles
is considered to have made further strides through going
ahead with the sixth nuclear test and repeating ballistic
missile launches. Coupled with its provocative rhetoric


2 Military Posture


**(1) General Situation**
North Korea has been building up its military capabilities
in accordance with the Four Military Guidelines (extensive
training for all soldiers, modernizing all military forces,
arming the entire population, and fortifying the entire
country).[6] North Korea’s military forces are comprised
mainly of ground forces, with a total troop strength of
roughly 1.28 million. While North Korea’s military forces
are believed to have been maintaining and enhancing
their capabilities and operational readiness, most of its
equipment is outdated. Meanwhile, North Korea has
forces such as largescale special operations force that
can conduct various operations ranging from intelligence
gathering and sabotage, to guerrilla warfare. Moreover,
North Korea seems to have many underground militaryrelated installations across its territory.

**(2) Military Capabilities**
The North Korean Army comprises about 1.10 million
personnel, and roughly two-thirds of them are believed to
be deployed along the DMZ. The main body of the army
is infantry, but the army also maintains armored forces
including at least 3,500 tanks and artillery. North Korea
is believed to regularly deploy long-range artillery along
the DMZ, such as 240 mm multiple rocket launchers and
170 mm self-propelled guns, which can reach cities and
bases in the northern part of the ROK including the capital
city of Seoul. Despite limited resources, it is deemed
that North Korea continues to selectively reinforce its
conventional forces and improve its equipment, such as
main battle tanks and multiple rocket launchers.[7]
The Navy has about 780 ships with a total
displacement of approximately 111,000 t and is chiefl y
comprised of small naval vessels such as high-speed


The Four Military Guidelines were adopted at the fi fth plenary meeting of the fourth KWP Central Committee in 1962.

According to “The Military Balance 2014,” North Korea is replacing Soviet-made T-54 and T-55 tanks with the Ch’onma-ho that North Korea independently produced based on the T-62. Furthermore,
the Defense White Paper 2014 that the ROK Ministry of National Defense released in January 2015 refers to North Korea’s development of a new 300 mm multiple rocket launcher, as well as the
signifi cant increase in the number of tanks, armored cars, and multiple rocket launchers in North Korea’s possession. North Korea allegedly fi red several rounds from the 300 mm multiple rocket
launcher on three instances in March 2016 and launched a new short-range surface-to-air missile in April 2016. In addition, North Korea announced that it had successfully conducted test launches
of a new type of surface-to-air missiles and a new type of surface-to-ship cruise missiles on May 28 and June 9, 2017, respectively.

It had been said that North Korea possessed two types of special operations forces: one under the military forces and the other under the KWP. However, it has been reported that these organizations
were consolidated in 2009 and the Reconnaissance General Bureau was established under the auspices of the military forces. The existence of the bureau was offi cially confi rmed in March 2013
when Korean Central Broadcasting Station reported General Kim Yong-chol as the Director of the Reconnaissance General Bureau. Moreover, James Thurman, then Commander of the U.S. Forces
Korea, stated, “North Korea possesses the world’s largest special operations force of over 60,000” in his speech at the Association of U.S. Army in October 2012. Additionally, the ROK Defense White
Paper 2016 notes, “Special operation forces are currently estimated at approximately 200,000 strong.”

The U.S. Director of National Intelligence’s “Worldwide Threat Assessment” of February 2016 notes, “North Korea probably remains capable and willing to launch disruptive or destructive cyber attacks
to support its political objectives.” The annual report “Military and Security Developments Involving the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea” (2015) submitted to Congress by the U.S. DoD also
in February 2016 states, “North Korea probably views OCO [offensive cyber operations] as an appealing platform from which to collect intelligence and cause disruption in South Korea and other
adversaries including the United States.” According to the ROK’s Defense White Paper 2016, North Korea has trained approximately 6,800 cyber warfare personnel and carries out various forms of

and behavior, such as suggesting a missile attack on Japan,
North Korea’s development of WMDs and missiles poses
an unprecedentedly serious and imminent threat to the
security of Japan and seriously undermine the peace and
security of the region and the international community.
Additionally, such development poses a serious challenge
to the entire international community with regard to the
non-proliferation of weapons, including WMDs.
On the other hand, at the Plenary Meeting of
the Central Committee of the KWP held on April 20,
2018, decisions were made to discontinue “nuclear
test and inter-continental ballistic rocket test-fi re,” and
to dismantle the northern nuclear test ground. In the
subsequent inter-Korean summit meeting held on April
27, North Korea expressed its intention to work towards
denuclearization. Then, on May 24, international press
representatives were invited to witness the destruction of
the northern nuclear test ground. Looking to the future, it
will be necessary to continue to carefully monitor moves
by North Korea, including what kind of concrete actions
it will take towards realizing the dismantlement of all
weapons of mass destruction and all ballistic missiles in
a complete, verifi able and irreversible manner.

**(1) Nuclear Weapons**
a. The Current Status of the Nuclear Weapons Program
Details of the current status of North Korea’s nuclear
weapons program are largely unclear, partly because
North Korea remains an extremely closed regime. In
light of the unclear status of past nuclear developments,
and considering North Korea has already conducted six
nuclear tests including the nuclear test in September 2017,
it is conceivable that North Korea has made considerable
progress in its nuclear weapons program. With regard to
plutonium, a fi ssile material that can be used for nuclear
weapons,[10] North Korea has suggested its production and


extraction on several instances.[11] Moreover, in June 2009,
North Korea announced that it would weaponize all of its
newly extracted plutonium.[12] In April 2013, North Korea
announced its policy to readjust and restart all nuclear
facilities in Yongbyon, including the nuclear reactor, the
disablement of which was agreed upon at the sixth round
of the Six-Party Talks in September 2007. In November
2013, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
opined that while lack of inspection makes it impossible to
determine conclusively, multiple activities were observed
from satellite imagery suggesting that the nuclear reactor
was restarted.[13] Furthermore, in September 2015, North
Korea stated that all nuclear facilities in Yongbyon
including the nuclear reactor and the uranium enrichment
plant were readjusted and started normal operation.
Because the restarting of the reactor could lead to the
production and extraction of plutonium by North Korea,
such developments are causes of great concern.
As for highly enriched uranium that can also be used
for nuclear weapons, in 2002 the United States announced
that North Korea acknowledged the existence of a
uranium enrichment program for nuclear weapons. Later
in June 2009, North Korea declared the commencement
of uranium enrichment. Furthermore, in November 2010,
North Korea disclosed its uranium enrichment facility to
American nuclear specialists and later announced that
it was operating a uranium enrichment plant equipped
with thousands of centrifuges. The expansion of this
uranium enrichment plant has been suggested in August
2013; in this regard, North Korea could have increased
its enrichment capabilities. The series of North Korean
behaviors related to uranium enrichment indicate the
possibility of the development of nuclear weapons using
highly enriched uranium in addition to plutonium.[14]
With regard to the development of nuclear weapons,
North Korea has conducted nuclear tests in October


10 Plutonium is synthetically produced in a nuclear reactor by irradiating uranium with neutrons, and then extracting it from used nuclear fuel at a reprocessing facility. Plutonium is then used as a basic
material for the production of nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, in order to use uranium for nuclear weapons, it is necessary to extract uranium 235 (U235), a highly fi ssile material, from natural uranium.
This process is called enrichment. Generally, a large-scale enrichment facility that combines thousands of centrifuges is used to boost the U235 concentration to nuclear weapon levels (over 90%).

11 North Korea announced in October 2003 that it had completed the reprocessing of 8,000 used fuel rods that contain plutonium, and in May 2005 that it had completed extraction of an additional
8,000 used fuel rods.

12 Then U.S. Forces Korea Commander Walter Sharp testifi ed before the House Armed Services Committee in April 2011 that “we assess North Korea currently holds enough plutonium to make several
nuclear weapons.” The ROK Defense White Paper 2016 estimates that North Korea has more than 50 kg of plutonium, up from the 40 kg estimate in the ROK Defense White Paper 2014.

13 The “Worldwide Threat Assessment” of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence of January 2016 notes, “North Korea has followed through on its announcement by expanding the size of its Yongbyon
enrichment facility and restarting the reactor that was previously used for plutonium production.” It is said that if the reactor is restarted, North Korea would have the capability to produce enough
plutonium (approximately 6 kg) to manufacture approximately one nuclear bomb in one year.

14 The “Worldwide Threat Assessment” of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence of January 2012 states, “the North’s disclosure (of a uranium enrichment facility) supports the U.S. longstanding
assessment that North Korea has pursued uranium-enrichment capability.” The ROK Defense White Paper 2016 assesses that North Korea’s highly enriched uranium (HEU) program “has reached a


-----

2006,[15] May 2009,[16] February 2013,[17] January 2016,[18]
September 2016,[19] and September 2017.[20] It is highly
likely that North Korea has made strides in its nuclear
weapons program, collecting the necessary data through
these nuclear tests.
It is believed that North Korea seeks to miniaturize
nuclear weapons and develop them into warheads
that can be mounted on ballistic missiles, as part of its
nuclear weapons program. On September 3, 2017, it
was announced that Chairman Kim Jong-un had visited
North Korea’s Nuclear Weapons Institute and had seen a
hydrogen bomb capable of being loaded into an ICBM,[21]
in addition to which, following North Korea’s sixth
nuclear test that was forced through on the same day,
North Korea announced that it “successfully carried out
a test of H-bomb for ICBM.” In general, miniaturizing
a nuclear weapon small enough to be mounted on a
ballistic missile requires a considerably high degree
of technological capacity. However, considering, for
example, that the United States, the former Soviet Union,
the United Kingdom, France, and China succeeded in
acquiring such technology by as early as the 1960s, as
well as the technological maturity that is estimated to
have been reached through North Korea’s previous six
nuclear tests, it is possible that North Korea has achieved
the miniaturization of nuclear weapons and has developed
nuclear warheads.[22]
Furthermore, the yield of the sixth nuclear weapons
test in 2017 was estimated to be the largest ever, with a
maximum yield of approximately 160kt. Given the size of


the estimated yield, the possibility cannot be discounted
that the test was of a hydrogen bomb. Although North
Korea asserted that the fourth nuclear test conducted in
January 2016 was a hydrogen bomb test, given that the
estimated yield was 6-7kt, it is doubtful that a general
hydrogen bomb test was conducted at that time.[23] In
any case, it is believed that with the passage of time,
there would be a greater risk of North Korea deploying
a ballistic missile mounted with a nuclear warhead that
includes Japan in its range.
In this regard, related developments need to be
monitored carefully. North Korea’s nuclear weapons
development, considered in conjunction with North
Korean efforts to enhance ballistic missile capabilities,
including extending the range of ballistic missiles that
could become the delivery vehicles of WMDs, poses
an unprecedentedly serious and imminent threat to the
security of Japan, and seriously undermine peace and
security of the region and international community.
Therefore, it can never be tolerated.
b. Background of the Nuclear Program
As regards the objective of North Korea’s nuclear
development, North Korea is deemed to be developing
nuclear weapons as an indispensable deterrent for
maintaining the existing regime in light of the following:
North Korea’s ultimate goal is allegedly the maintenance
of the existing regime;[24] North Korea considers that it
needs its own nuclear deterrence to counter the nuclear
threat of the United States[25] and is in no position at least
in the short-term to overturn its inferiority in conventional


15 On October 27, 2006, as a result of the independently collected information and its analysis as well as Japan’s own careful examination of the U.S. and ROK analyses, the Japanese Government
arrived at the judgment that the probability of North Korea conducting a nuclear test was extremely high.

16 The Japanese Government believes that North Korea conducted a nuclear test on this day, given that North Korea announced on May 25, 2009, via the Korean Central News Agency, that it had
successfully conducted an underground nuclear test, and in light of the Japan Meteorological Agency’s detection of seismic waves with a waveform that were unlikely those of a natural earthquake.

17 On February 12, 2013 at around 11:59 am, the Japan Meteorological Agency detected seismic waves with an epicenter located in the vicinity of North Korea, which had waveforms that were unlikely
those of a natural earthquake. On the same day, North Korea announced via the Korean Central News Agency that it successfully conducted a nuclear test. On this basis, the Government of Japan
verifi ed the facts in coordination with other relevant parties, including the United States and the ROK. Based on a comprehensive consideration of the aforementioned information, the Japanese
Government determined that North Korea conducted a nuclear test. North Korea announced that it “succeeded in the third underground nuclear test,” “the test was conducted in a safe and perfect
way on a high level with the use of a smaller and light A-bomb, unlike the previous ones, yet with great explosive power,” “physically demonstrating the good performance of the DPRK’s nuclear
deterrence that has become diversifi ed.”

18 On January 6, 2016 at around 10:30 am, the Japan Meteorological Agency detected seismic waves with an epicenter located in the vicinity of North Korea, which had waveforms that were unlikely
those of a natural earthquake. On the same day, North Korea announced via the Korean Central News Agency that it successfully conducted a hydrogen bomb test. Based on a comprehensive
consideration of this and other information, the Japanese Government determined that North Korea conducted a nuclear test.

19 On September 9, 2016 at approximately 9:30 a.m., the Japan Meteorological Agency detected seismic waves with an epicenter located in the vicinity of North Korea, which had waveforms that were
unlikely those of a natural earthquake. Based on a comprehensive consideration of all the information including this, the Government believes that North Korea conducted a nuclear test.

20 At around 12:31 p.m. on September 3, 2017, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) detected seismic waves with an epicenter located in the vicinity of North Korea, which had waveforms that were
unlikely those of a natural earthquake. Based on comprehensive considerations, including the information from the JMA, the Government determined that the earthquake occurred as a result of a
nuclear test by North Korea.

21 On September 3, 2017, in a report on a visit by Chairman Kim Jong-un to North Korea’s Nuclear Weapons Institute, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) announced that North Korea is able to
conduct an “ultra-powerful electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack over a wide area.”

22 Over ten years have already passed since North Korea conducted its fi rst nuclear test in October 2006. Furthermore, North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests to date. This timetable for technology
development and the number of tests are reaching levels that are by no means inadequate, even when compared to the processes of developing technologies to miniaturize and lighten nuclear
weapons in the United States, former Soviet Union, United Kingdom, France, and China. The ROK’s Defense White Paper 2016 assesses that “North Korea’s ability to miniaturize nuclear weapons
seems to have reached a considerable level.”

23 In regard to North Korea’s nuclear test on January 6, 2016, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence’s “Worldwide Threat Assessment” (February 2016) states, “Although we are continuing to evaluate
this event, the low yield of the test is not consistent with a successful test of a thermonuclear device.” Furthermore, in January 2016, the ROK National Intelligence Service reportedly briefed the
National Assembly that because the power and seismic waves of the fourth nuclear test do not match up to those of the previous three nuclear tests, the test was unlikely a hydrogen bomb test.

24 U.S. DoD’s “Military and Security Developments Involving the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,” February 2016.

25 For example, a statement issued by the National Defense Commission of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea on March 14, 2014 alleges that the United States threatens and intimidates North

forces vis-à-vis the United States and the ROK; North
Korea asserts that the Iraqi and Libyan regimes collapsed
and that Syria was attacked by U.S. Forces in April 2017
due to their lack of nuclear deterrence;[26] and North Korea
reiterates nuclear weapons will never be traded away
at negotiations.
In fact, North Korea has repeatedly claimed to the
international community that it was a “nuclear weapons
state.”[27] In March 2013, North Korea adopted the “new
strategic line” (so-called “Byungjin line”) policy of
simultaneous economic and nuclear development, alleging
that even if it does not increase defense spending, it would
be able to concentrate on its economic development and
on improving the people’s livelihood as long as nuclear
deterrence is robust, and thereby increases the effectiveness
of its war deterrent and defense force. At the Seventh KWP
Congress and also in the “New Year’s Address” of January
2018, it made clear that it would remain steadfast to this
policy. At the Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee
of the KWP in April 2018, in addition to declaring the
“Byungjin line” was successfully carried out, North Korea
declared that among other things, it had determined to
“concentrate all efforts on building a powerful socialist
economy and markedly improving the standard of people's
living through the mobilization of all human and material
resources of the country.”
With regard to the issue of North Korea’s development
of nuclear weapons, six rounds of the Six-Party Talks have
been held since August 2003, aimed at taking peaceful
measures to achieve the verifi able denuclearization on
the Korean Peninsula. At the sixth round of the Talks
in September 2007, the parties reached an agreement,
which included completion of the disablement of nuclear
facilities in Yongbyon and “a complete and correct
declaration of all (North Korea’s) nuclear programs” by
the end of the year. However, the implementation of the
agreement has not been completed, and the Six-Party
Talks has been suspended since December 2008. At the


fi rst-ever U.S.-North Korea summit meeting held on
June 12, 2018, Chairman Kim Jong-un made clear his
intention to work towards the complete denuclearization
of the Korean Peninsula, and confi rmed that negotiations
would continue with the United States. Based on the
outcomes of the U.S.-North Korea summit meeting it is
now necessary to work closely with the United States and
the ROK and cooperate with the international community,
including China and Russia, to elicit concrete actions
from North Korea towards the dismantlement of all
weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles of all
ranges in a complete, verifi able and irreversible manner.

**(2) Biological and Chemical Weapons**
North Korea is an extremely closed regime. In addition,
most materials, equipment, and technology used for
manufacturing biological and chemical weapons are for
both military and civilian uses, which in turn facilitates
camoufl age. For these reasons, details of the status of North
Korea’s biological and chemical weapons development
and arsenals are unclear. However, with regard to chemical
weapons, North Korea is suspected to have several
facilities capable of producing chemical agents and already
a substantial stockpile of such agents. North Korea is also
thought to have some infrastructure for the production of
biological weapons.[28] Possession of sarin, VX, mustard and
other chemical weapons, and of anthrax, smallpox, pest
and other biological agents that could be used as biological
weapons have been pointed out.[29] The possibility cannot
be denied that North Korea is able to load biological and/
or chemical weapons on warheads.


**(3) Ballistic Missiles**
As is the case with WMDs, many of the details of North
Korea’s ballistic missiles are unknown, partly owing
to the country’s extremely closed regime. It appears,
however, that North Korea gives high priority to the
development of ballistic missiles out of political and


26 For example, a comment in the Rodong Sinmun dated December 2, 2013 contends that the situation in Iraq and Libya teaches an acute lesson that countries under the constant threat of U.S.
preemptive nuclear attack have no choice but to become a victim of U.S. state terrorism, unless the countries have powerful deterrent capability. In addition, the “Statement by the Spokesperson of the
Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea” dated April 8, 2017 states with regard to the U.S. attack on Syria two days earlier on April 6 as follows: “Swaggering as a superpower,
the US has been picking only on countries without nuclear weapons and the Trump administration is no exception.”

27 North Korea announced in 2005 that it manufactured nuclear weapons, and declared itself a “nuclear weapons state” in 2012 in its revised constitution. In April 2013, after conducting its third
nuclear test in February, North Korea adopted the Law on Consolidating the Position of Self-Defensive Nuclear Weapons State. During the Seventh KWP Congress held in May 2016, KWP Chairman
Kim Jong-un delivered a report on the work of the KWP Central Committee, setting out that North Korea was a “nuclear weapons state,” and stating, “We will consistently take hold on the strategic
line of simultaneously pushing forward the economic construction and the building of nuclear force and boost self-defensive nuclear force both in quality and quantity.”

28 For example, the ROK Defense White Paper 2016 points out that, following the commencement of production in the 1980s, it is estimated that North Korea has a stock of 2,500-5,000 t of various
chemical weapons stored. It also notes that North Korea likely has the capability to produce a variety of biological weapons including anthrax, smallpox, and pest. Moreover, the U.S. DoD’s “Military
and Security Developments Involving the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea” of February 2016 points out that, “North Korea probably could employ CW [chemical weapons] agents by modifying a
variety of conventional munitions, including artillery and ballistic missiles.” North Korea ratifi ed the Biological Weapons Convention in 1987 but has not acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention.

29 In principle, the ballistic missile defense system is also used to handle ballistic missiles carrying biological or chemical weapons. With regard to the damage on the ground in the case where a ballistic
missile carrying a biological or chemical weapon is destroyed by a Patriot missile PAC-3, etc., there is no single answer to the question since the damage varies according to the various conditions
such as the type, performance, intercepted altitude and speed of the ballistic missile, and the weather. However, in general terms, the biological or chemical weapon will likely be neutralized by the
heat, etc. at the time of the destruction of the ballistic missile, and even if it retains its potency it will disperse during the freefall stage. Thus, it is believed that the ballistic missile will be unable to

diplomatic considerations and from the viewpoint of
earning foreign currency,[30] in addition to enhancing its
military capabilities. The ballistic missiles currently
deemed to be possessed and developed by North Korea
are the following.[31]

a ballistic missile with ICBM range (estimated) (November 2017))
Fig. I-2-2-4 (Ballistic Missile Launches by North Korea to Date)

a. Types of Ballistic Missiles Possessed or Developed by
North Korea
(a) Toksa
Toksa is a short-range ballistic missile with a range
estimated to be approximately 120 km. It is mounted on
a Transporter-Erector-Launcher (TEL). It is deemed that
Toksa is the fi rst ballistic missile possessed or developed
by North Korea which adopts a solid fuel propellant.[32]

(b) Scud
The Scud is a liquid fuel propellant single-stage ballistic
missile and is transported and operated on a TEL.
Scud B and Scud C, a variant of Scud B with extended
range, are short-range ballistic missiles with ranges
estimated to be about 300 km and 500 km, respectively.
It is believed that North Korea has manufactured and
deployed them, and has exported them to the Middle
East and other countries.
The Scud ER (Extended Range) is a ballistic missile
that has an extended range due to the extension of the
Scud’s body as well as the reduction in weight of the
warhead, among other factors. The range of a Scud ER
is estimated to reach approximately 1,000 km,[33] and it
appears that a part of Japan falls within this range.
In addition, North Korea is developing a ballistic
missile that appears to be an improvement of the Scud
missile. This ballistic missile was launched on May 29,
2017, and is presumed to have fl own approximately
400 km and fallen into Japan’s exclusive economic zone
(EEZ). A day after the launch, North Korea announced
that it had successfully conducted a test launch of a newly
developed ballistic rocket incorporating a precision
navigation guidance system. In addition, while the


images released by North Korea show that the ballistic
missile was launched from a continuous track TEL and
had what appears to be small wings[34] on its warhead,
i.e., characteristics different from those of existing Scud
missiles, the shape other than the warhead and length are
similar to existing Scud missiles. Another similarity is
that it can be confi rmed that the missile has straight-line
exhausts characteristic of a liquid fuel-propelled engine.
It has also been noted that this ballistic missile is equipped
with a maneuverable re-entry vehicle (MaRV).[35] Given
that North Korea announced that Chairman Kim Jong-un



**[KEY WORD]**

Transporter-Erector-Launcher (TEL)

The signs of a launch from a fi xed launcher are easy for the adversary

to detect and are vulnerable to attack by the adversary. TEL was

developed mainly by the former Soviet Union among others in order

to make the detection of launch signs more diffi cult and increase

survivability. According to the U.S. DoD’s “Military and Security

Developments Involving the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea” of

May 2018, North Korea possesses a maximum of 100 TELs for Scuds,

50 TELs for Nodongs, and 50 TELs for IRBMs (Musudans).

The type of TEL differs according to the length and weight of the

ballistic missile. The Scud, Nodong and Musudan are mounted on a

four-, fi ve-, and six-axle wheel drive TEL respectively. The new type

of intercontinental-range ballistic missile launched on July 4 and 28,

and the KN-08/14 are mounted on an eight-axle wheel-drive TEL, and

the intercontinental-range ballistic missile believed to be a new type

that was launched on November 29 appears to have been mounted

and transferred on a nine-axle wheel-drive TEL. The ballistic missile

launched on February 12 and May 21, 2017 appears to have been

launched from a continuous track TEL. Generally, a continuous track

TEL is adapted to operating on uneven ground but is not adapted to

long distance transportation compared to the wheel-drive TEL.

As for a TEL-mounted missile launch, it is deemed diffi cult to

detect individual specifi c signs in advance concerning the detailed

location and timing of the launch. This is because it is operated by being

mounted and transported on a TEL, and furthermore, military-related

underground facilities are thought to exist nationwide. Along with
activities related to the development of ballistic missiles, developments

related to the building of TELs require close watch as they concern the

operational capabilities of ballistic missiles by North Korea.


30 North Korea admitted that it is exporting ballistic missiles to earn foreign currency. (Comment by the Korean Central News Agency on June 16, 1998, and statement made by a North Korean Foreign
Ministry spokesperson on December 13, 2002) At the same time, it is pointed out that North Korea’s ballistic missile exports have been set back by increasing pressure from the international
community.

31 According to “Jane’s Sentinel Security Assessment China and Northeast Asia” (accessed in April 2018) North Korea possesses 700 to 1,000 ballistic missiles in total, 45% of which are presumed to
be Scud-class, 45% Nodong-class, and the remaining 10% other intermediate- and long-range ballistic missiles.

32 In March 2007, then U.S. Forces Korea Commander Burwell B. Bell testifi ed before the House Armed Services Committee that, “North Korea is developing a new solid propellant short-range ballistic
missile. Recently, in March 2006, North Korea successfully test-fi red the missile. Once operational, the missile can be deployed more fl exibly and rapidly than the existing system and North Korea
will be able to launch the missile in a much shorter preparation period.”

33 “Military and Security Developments Involving the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea” published by DoD in May 2018.

34 It is generally said that small wings on the warhead have the functions of stabilizing aerodynamics, navigating during fl ight, and enhancing precision.

35 For example, according to “Jane’s Sentinel Security Assessment China and Northeast Asia” (accessed in April 2018), the launch on May 29, 2017, was presumed to have been the fi rst launch of a

Nodong aimed at enhancing accuracy by improving the
shape of the warhead (whose range is deemed to reach
approximately 1,500 km through the weight reduction of
the warhead). Against this backdrop, the launch of this
type of ballistic missile was confi rmed for the fi rst time
in the images published by North Korea a day after the
launch of one Scud and two Nodong missiles on July 19,
2016. Thus, it is necessary to continue to pay attention to
related developments.
(d) Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missile (SLBM)
It has been suggested that North Korea is developing an
SLBM and a new submarine which is designed to carry
the SLBM (referred to by North Korea as “Pukguksong”).
Since it announced in May 2015 through its media that it
conducted a successful test launch of an SLBM, it has
made public SLBM launches on four occasions.[36] Judging
from the images and footage that it has made public so far,
North Korea may have succeeded in operating the “cold
launch system,” in which the missile is ignited after it is
ejected into the air. Moreover, in the launches in April
and August 2016, it appears, based on observations such
as the shape of the fl ame coming out of the missile and
the color of the smoke, that the militarily superior solid
fuel propellant system was adopted.[37]
A ballistic missile presumed to be an SLBM has
been confi rmed in fl ight in the direction of Japan,
launched from the vicinity of Sinpo, on the east coast
of North Korea, on August 24, 2016. The SLBM fl ew
approximately 500 km. Considering that this was its
fi rst SLBM to fl y approximately 500 km, the possibility
cannot be denied that North Korea had striven to solve
the problems through the preceding launches and
achieved certain technological progress. Furthermore,
it is predicted that the ballistic missile presumed to
be the SLBM that was launched at this time fl ew on
a somewhat higher than nominal trajectory. If it were
launched on a nominal trajectory the fi ring range is
expected to surpass 1,000 km.[38] It is also thought that
North Korea’s SLBM launches are conducted from a
Gorae-class submarine (displacement 1,500 t). North
Korea is believed to have one such submarine. It is also
pointed out that North Korea seeks to develop a larger
submarine to launch SLBMs.[39]

It is deemed that through developing the SLBM


had ordered the development of ballistic missiles capable
of precision attacks on enemy ships and other individual
targets, the intent appears to be to enhance the accuracy
of ballistic missile attacks.
(c) Nodong
The Nodong is a liquid fuel propelled single-stage
ballistic missile and is transported and operated on a
TEL. It is assessed to have a range of about 1,300 km,
reaching almost all of Japan.
Although the details of Nodong’s performance have
not been confi rmed, Nodong may not have the accuracy
to carry out precise strikes on specifi c target installations,
as this ballistic missile is likely based on Scud
technology. However, it has been suggested that North
Korea is working to increase the Nodong’s accuracy. In
this regard, it had been suggested that there is a type of


36 On May 9, 2015, North Korea announced that it had succeeded in a test launch of an SLBM. On January 8, 2016, it released footage of an SLBM test launch that appears to be different from the one
unveiled in May 2015. On April 24 and August 25, 2016, it again announced that it had succeeded in SLBM test launches. Moreover, the MOD predicts that North Korea also launched one ballistic
missile presumed to be an SLBM on July 9, 2016, although North Korea has not made an announcement about the launches.

37 It has been pointed out that North Korea’s SLBM is an improved version of the former Soviet Union’s liquid fuel propelled SLBM “SS-N-6,” similar to the Musudan.

38 According to the Korean Central Broadcasting Station on August 25, 2016, North Korea announced that this test launch “was successfully conducted without any negative effects on the safety of
nearby countries” based on the “high-angle launch system,” which presumably means a “lofted trajectory.”

and a new submarine to carry it, North Korea intends
to diversify its ballistic missile attack capabilities and
improve survivability.
(e) Ballistic missile modifi ed from the SLBM
North Korea launched a ballistic missile on both
February 12 and May 21, 2017, both of which appeared
to be a modifi ed version of the SLBM for ground launch
(referred to by North Korea as “Pukguksong-2”).
This ballistic missile is estimated to have fl own
approximately 500 km on both occasions, on somewhat
higher trajectories than nominal. If it were launched
on a nominal trajectory, the fi ring range is expected to
surpass 1,000 km. A day after the launch on February
12, North Korea named the ballistic missile that was
launched “Pukguksong-2” and announced that it was
developed as a ground-to-ground ballistic missile based
on the results of the August 2016 SLBM launch. It also
announced a day after the launch on May 21, 2017 that
it had again successfully conducted the test launch of
the Pukguksong-2 and that Chairman Kim Jong-un had
authorized its “operational deployment.” Moreover, the
launch by a “cold launch system,” in which the missile
is ignited after it is ejected into the air from a continuous
track TEL, and the characteristic radial exhausts of
solid fuel propellant engines, can be confi rmed from
each of the images that North Korea released. It has the
characteristics of appearing to be using “cold launch
system” and solid fuel propellant engines in common
with the SLBM. Given that North Korea has made
references to its deployment for operational deployment,
there is a possibility that North Korea will newly deploy
a solid fuel propellant engine that includes Japan within
its fi ring range.
(f) Intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM)
To date North Korea has launched three liquid fuelpropelled IRBMs (referred to by North Korea as
“Hwasong-12”). This ballistic missile was launched on


May 14, 2017 and is presumed to have reached a height
of over 2,000 km and fl ew a distance of approximately
800 km for about 30 minutes. Based on this fl ight
pattern, it is presumed that the ballistic missile was
launched on a lofted trajectory. Had it been launched
on a nominal trajectory, the maximum fi ring range is
expected to be close to approximately 5,000 km. In
addition, the straight-line exhausts characteristic of a
liquid fuel propelled engine can be confi rmed from the
images released by North Korea a day after the launch,
suggesting that the ballistic missile uses liquid fuel. On
August 29 and September 15, 2017 single missiles of
this class were launched and fl ew over Japan’s territory
in the vicinity of the Oshima Peninsula and Cape Erimo.
The ballistic missile launched on August 29 fl ew at an
altitude of approximately 550 km over Japanese territory,
and is presumed to have fl own a total distance of 2,700
km. The ballistic missile launched on September 15 is
presumed to have fl own over Japanese territory at an
altitude of between 700 and 800 km, fl ying for a total
distance of approximately 3,700 km. These launches
were the fi rst cases of North Korea launching what it
calls ballistic missiles that fl ew over Japan’s territory.
In view of their fl ight paths, these missiles appear to
demonstrate a certain level of function as an IRBM. Also,
the fact that missiles that overfl ew Japan were launched
in succession in a short time period would suggest that
North Korea is steadily improving its ballistic missile
capabilities. Furthermore, although at the time of launches
in May and August 2017 the missiles were confi rmed to
have been launched after being separated from the wheeldrive TEL, at the time of the September launch the missile
was confi rmed to have been launched while still attached
to the wheel-drive TEL. Considering this point, together
with North Korea’s claims at the time of the launch
that it was for the purposes of “confi rming practical
operational procedures” and “realize the potential of the


-----

Hwasong-12 there is a possibility that North Korea is
improving its practical operational capabilities.
In 2016 North Korea conducted repeated launches
of an IRBM that is presumed to be the Musudan,[40] but
although the missile launched in June flew for a certain
distance on a lofted trajectory, the fact that there were
two successive launch failures in October would
suggest that there may still be obstacles remaining
towards the operationalization of the Musudan and that
North Korea may be concentrating on the development
and operationalization of the “Hwasong-12” as an
IRBM instead.
(g) Intercontinental-range ballistic missile
(Launched on July 4 and 28, 2017)
To date North Korea has launched two intercontinentalrange ballistic missiles (referred to by North Korea as
“Hwasong-14”). One such ballistic missile was launched
on July 4, 2017, reaching a height well over 2,500
km, and is estimated to have fl own approximately 40
minutes. It fl ew approximately 900 km and is estimated
to have fallen into Japan’s EEZ. Another missile that
was launched on July 28 reached a height of well over
3,500 km, and is estimated to have fl own approximately
45 minutes, covering a distance of approximately
1,000 km before falling into Japan’s EEZ. From this
fl ight pattern it is presumed that the two ballistic missiles
were launched on a lofted trajectory. If they were to have
been launched on a normal trajectory it is estimated that
they would have a maximum range of at least 5,500 km.
On July 4, the day of the launch, North Korea made an
“important announcement,”[41] announcing that it had
successfully conducted a test launch of a new type of
ICBM. Furthermore, on the day following the July 28
launch, North Korea announced that the “nuclear bomb
detonation device” had functioned normally, emphasizing
that the safety of the warhead in an atmospheric reentry
environment had been made maintained. This suggests
that North Korea is aiming to operationalize long-range
ballistic missiles.
Based on images released by North Korea, the
ballistic missiles launched on July 4 and 28 have the
following in common with the IRBM launched on May
14: (1) the engine system consists of one main engine
and four auxiliary engines, (2) the shape of the lower part
of the propulsion system is conical, and (3) the straight

line fl ame of liquid-propulsion systems can be confi rmed.
Based on these facts and the respective ranges that can be
estimated for the missiles, the possibility can be deduced
that the intercontinental-range ballistic missiles that were
launched on July 4 and 28 were developed on the basis of
the new-type IRBM that had been launched on May 14.
Also based on images published by North Korea, it can
be confi rmed that the ballistic missiles that were launched
on July 4 and 28 had been mounted on the wheeled eightaxle TEL similar to KN-08/14 (see (j) below). However,
it can be confi rmed from the images at the time of the
launches that they were launched from simplifi ed launch
pads, not TELs. Furthermore, the images suggest that the
missile was of two-stage construction.
(h) New type of intercontinental-range ballistic missile
(Launched on November 29, 2017)
On November 29, 2017, North Korea launched a single
missile that is presumed to have been a new type of
intercontinental-range ballistic missile (referred to by
North Korea as “Hwasong-15”) different to the missiles
described in (g) above. The missile reached a height
of well over 4,000 km, and is estimated to have fl own
approximately 53 minutes, covering a distance of
approximately 1,000 km before falling into Japan’s EEZ.
From this fl ight pattern it is presumed that the missile was
launched on a lofted trajectory. On the day of the launch,
North Korea made an “government statement,” declaring
that it had successfully conducted a test launch of the
“Hwasong-15,” a newly developed type of ICBM with
the capability to strike all areas of the U.S. mainland, and
asserting that it had now completed development of its


40 With a range of between 2,500 and 4,000 km, it has been suggested that all parts of Japan and Guam may fall within the Musudan’s fi ring range. Similar to its Scud and Nodong counterparts,
it is liquid fuel-propelled and is loaded onto a TEL to transport and operate. It has been noted that Musudan is a revamped version of the Russian SLBM SS-N-6 that North Korea acquired in the
early 1990s.

Commentary North Korea’s ICBM development situation **COLUMN**

North Korea launched an intercontinental-range ballistic missile twice in July 2017 and once in November 2017 and asserted that
“all of the mainland United States is within range for nuclear attack” in the New Year’s address given in January 2018.
Generally, realization of an ICBM as a weapon requires (1) a range of at least 5,500km, (2) miniaturization of nuclear weapon
and acquisition of nuclear warhead, and (3) atmospheric reentry technology.
Regarding range (1), the intercontinental-range ballistic missile launched twice in July 2018 (referred to by North Korea as
Hwasong-14) appears to have a range of at least 5,500km based on the fl ight distance, altitude, and other points. Additionally,
the new intercontinental-range ballistic missile (referred to by North Korea as Hwasong-15) launched in November 2018 might
exceed 10,000km depending on the warhead weight and other aspects.
Regarding development of miniaturization of nuclear weapons and acquisition of nuclear warhead (2), North Korea might have
reached this level in light of the more than 10 years elapsed since conducting the fi rst nuclear test in 2006 and the technological
maturity estimated to have been reached through a total of six nuclear tests.
Regarding atmospheric reentry technology (3), heat protection technology that prevents deformation, destruction, and other
damage to the nuclear warhead on reentry into the atmosphere after the ballistic missile has been launched and leaves the
atmosphere is particularly important. While North Korea has repeatedly claimed to have verifi ed this technology, it is still necessary
to carefully analyze whether North Korean has actually verifi ed
this technology.
North Korea is deemed to accumulate related technologies
through repeated launches of ballistic missiles. Given this
reality, it is necessary to establish even further readiness in
order to protect the lives and property of the Japanese people
and defend Japan’s territories, seas, and airspace.
If North Korea made further progress in the development
of ballistic missiles and demonstrated the atmospheric
reentry technology, etc., could unilaterally gain recognition
of having strategic deterrence against the United States.
Overconfi dence or misperception of this deterrence by North
Korea might lead to increased and more serious military
provocations in the region. Japan thinks this situation could
warrant substantial concern.
Some observers suggest that North Korea could obtain
the ability to attack the United States with a nuclear-armed
ballistic missile within a few months. The Japanese government
needs to carefully monitor North Korea’s nuclear and missile
development situation. Image of reentry into the atmosphere


state nuclear force.
The following points would suggest that this missile
is a new type of intercontinental-range ballistic missile,
different from the two intercontinental-range ballistic
missiles launched in July 2017: (1) its fl ight distance
and altitude, (2) the fact that North Korea announced
the successful test launch of a new type of ICBM, the
“Hwasong-15,” (3) the fact that the missile was deployed
on a previously unseen nine-axle wheel-drive TEL,
and (4) that the nose of the warhead was more rounded
than previous missiles. In addition, according to images
released by North Korea, the missile was of a two-stage

the TEL prior to launch and that its straight-line exhausts
are characteristic of a liquid fuel propelled engine.
Furthermore, based on the fl ight altitude, distance
fl own and released images, it can be assumed that this
missile could have a range in excess of 10,000 km,
depending on the weight of the warhead deployed, etc.,
thus renewing concerns over the increasing ranges of
North Korea’s ballistic missiles.
In addition, although the wheel-drive TELs
possessed by North Korea are thought to be modifi ed
versions of Russian and Chinese TELs, given that North
Korea has claimed to have developed its own TEL, future

(g) Taepodong-1 and 2
Taepodong-1 and Taepodong-2 are long-range ballistic
missiles launched from fi xed launch pads. Taepodong-1
is assumed to be a two-stage, liquid fuel propellant
ballistic missile with a Nodong used as its fi rst stage and
a Scud as its second stage. It is estimated to have a range
of at least approximately 1,500 km. Taepodong-1 was
launched from the Taepodong district on North Korea’s
northeastern coastline in 1998, and it is presumed that part
of it fl ew over Japan and fell in to the Sanriku offshore
waters. Taepodong-1 may have been a transitory product
for the development of Taepodong-2.
Taepodong-2 is believed to be a missile which uses
in its fi rst stage, four engines, each of which is developed
based on the technologies of Nodong, and the same type
of engine in its second stage. Its range is estimated to
be approximately 6,000 km for the two-stage type, while
the range of its three-stage variant can be more than
approximately 10,000 km assuming that the weight of
the warhead is not over approximately 1 t. Taepodong-2
missiles and its variants have been launched a total of fi ve
times so far.
Most recently, in February 2016, North Korea
conducted a launch of a missile disguised as a “satellite”
from the Tongch’ang-ri district in the northwest
coastline of North Korea using a Taepodong-2 variant,
a type similar to that of the previous ballistic missile
launch in December 2012, after notifying international
organizations.[42] It is assessed that North Korea’s long

range ballistic missiles technological reliability had
been advanced by this launch because it is estimated that
(1) it successfully launched two similar types of ballistic
missiles in a row; (2) the missile fl ew in almost the same
way as the last launch; and (3) it put an object into orbit
around the Earth.
Accordingly, it is believed that these test launches
of long-range ballistic missiles can contribute to the
development of shorter-range missiles in such ways
as increasing the range and payload capability and
improving the circular error probability (CEP). Also,
related technology such as the separation technology
of multi-stage propelling devices and the technology
of posture control and thrust modulation of long-range
ballistic missiles can be applied to other middle-range and
long-range ballistic missiles that North Korea is newly
developing. Therefore, the launch may lead not only to
the improvement of other types of its ballistic missiles
including Nodong but also to the advancement of North
Korea’s entire ballistic missile program including the
development of new ballistic missiles and diversifi cation
of attack measure.
North Korea continues to claim that it will keep
conducting “satellite launches” and will develop and
launch more capable satellite launch vehicles. It is
possible that North Korea will further develop its longrange ballistic missiles by repeating similar launches
under the name of “satellite” launches, in order to carry
out further technical tests to operationalize its long-range
ballistic missiles. It has been suggested that North Korea
is carrying out modifi cation for upsizing its launch tower
in Tongch’ang-ri district.[43] While the missile launched
in February 2016 was similar in size to the Taepodong-2
variant launched in December 2012, North Korea may
launch larger long-range ballistic missiles in the future.
Furthermore, as launches from fi xed launch pads are
vulnerable to external attacks, North Korea may seek
resiliency and survivability through building underground
or silo launch facilities and launching from TELs.
(j) KN-08/KN-14
The details of the new missile “KN-08” which was
showcased at the military parade in April 2012 and July


42 In June 2016, what appears to be a part of the fairing of the Taepodong-2 variant launched in February 2016, based on its appearance and other features, washed ashore and was discovered in the
coast of Tottori Prefecture. The MOD has received it from Shimane Prefecture and was analyzing the details as of the end of June 2018.

43 Articles dated October 1 and July 29, 2014 published on the website (38 North) of the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University in the United States point out that analyses of satellite images
of the Tongch’ang-ri district show that the launch tower was raised to 55 m, enabling launches of rockets up to 50 m in height, larger than the Taepodong-2 variant (total height approx. 30 m) which

2013 are unknown. However, the missile is believed to be
an ICBM.[44] At the military parade in October 2015, a new
missile thought to be the “KN-08” was showcased with a
different-shaped warhead from the previous version.[45] The
U.S. DoD reportedly calls the new missile, considered
a variant of the “KN-08,” the “KN-14.” Whereas the
Taepodong-2 is launched from a fi xed launch pad, the
“KN-08” and “KN-14” are carried by a TEL, making it
diffi cult to detect signs of their launch in advance, and is
likely intended to increase survivability.
b. Trends in Recent Ballistic Missile Launches
North Korea has repeatedly launched various types of
ballistic missiles. In particular, since 2016 it has conducted
as many as 40 ballistic missile launches, including launches
of what appear to be new types of missiles.
As for trends in North Korea’s ballistic missile
launches, fi rstly, it appears that the country seeks to increase
the fi ring range of ballistic missiles.[46] In February 2016,
it launched a long-range ballistic missile (a Taepodong-2
variant) which was disguised as a “satellite,” and in the
same year repeatedly launched the Musudan, considered
to have Guam in its range. As for the IRBM that was
launched in 2017, it is expected to reach a maximum
fi ring range of approximately 5,000 km. Furthermore,
in July intercontinental-range ballistic missiles were
launched, followed by another intercontinental-range
ballistic missile launch in November, which is considered
to have been a new type of missile that could have a
range in excess of 10,000 km, depending on the weight
of the warhead deployed,etc.[47] Although it is considered
necessary for the operationalization of long-range ballistic
missiles to further verify technology for protecting the
re-entry vehicle from the ultrahigh temperature that is
generated during the atmospheric re-entry of the warhead
part, North Korea announced in March 2016 that it
had successfully conducted a “mock ballistic missile
atmospheric re-entry environment test”[48] and announced
that it had demonstrated atmospheric reentry technology
for warheads on the July 4 launch. In addition, with


announcements such as the one in November 2017 on the
day of the launch of what is believed to have been a new
type of intercontinental-range ballistic missile, claiming
that it had re-verifi ed warhead reliability in a reentry
environment,[49] North Korea is displaying an intention
to seek to secure and enhance technology aimed at the
operationalization of long-range ballistic missiles.[50] This
has become a serious concern for relevant countries
including Japan.
Secondly, North Korea may be aiming to enhance
the accuracy and operation capabilities necessary for
saturation attacks with regard to ballistic missiles already
deployed. As for the Scud and Nodong, which are already
deployed, launches had been confi rmed when Kim Jong-il
was the Chairman of the National Defense Commission.
Since 2014, they have been launched eastward from
unprecedented locations in western North Korea, cutting
across the Korean Peninsula, in the early morning and late
hours of the night using TELs, often in multiple numbers.
This indicates that North Korea is capable of launching
Scuds and Nodongs from any place and at any time, from
which it is deemed that it has increased confi dence in the
performance and reliability of its ballistic missiles.
As for Scuds and Nodongs, since 2016, there have
been launches where it is presumed that warheads fell in
Japan’s EEZ, posing a major threat to Japan’s security. The
ballistic missile launched on August 3, 2016 that appears
to be a Nodong fl ew approximately 1,000 km, with its
warhead predicted to have fallen into the Japanese EEZ
for the fi rst time. The three ballistic missiles launched
on September 5 of the same year, apparently Scud ERs,
were launched simultaneously and are all estimated to
have fallen in more or less the same place in Japan’s
EEZ after fl ying approximately 1,000 km. Moreover, the
four ballistic missiles, apparently Scud ERs, launched on
March 6, 2017 were launched simultaneously, three of
which are predicted to have fallen within Japan’s EEZ
and the other near the EEZ, after fl ying approximately
1,000 km. It is possible that through these launches, North


44 The “Worldwide Threat Assessment” of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence of February 2015 notes that, “[North Korea] has publicly displayed its KN-08 road-mobile ICBM twice. We assess that
North Korea has already taken initial steps towards fi elding this system, although the system has not been fl ight-tested.”

45 Jane’s Defence Weekly dated October 13, 2015 notes that the “KN-08” showcased at the military parade on October 10, 2015 had a larger third stage than the earlier version, and therefore, could
have an extended range. It also suggests that low quality ablative materials cannot withstand high temperatures during re-entry, and thus, a blunter shape warhead may have been developed to
reduce speed to protect the warhead.

46 North Korea is thought to have started developing longer-range ballistic missiles by the 1990s, including Nodong.

47 KWP Chairman Kim Jong-un's January 2017 New Year's Address announced that the test launch of an ICBM had entered the fi nal stage of preparation. In North Korea, a New Year’s Address by
President Kim Il-sung had been given every year on January 1 up to 1994. Since the death of the president, from 1995 to 2012, a New Year’s Joint Editorial by the KWP bulletin Rodong Sinmun, the
Korean People’s Army bulletin Joson Inmingun, and the Kimilsungist Youth League bulletin Youth Vanguard had been published in its place.

48 According to images released by North Korea, the aim of the test appears to be to conduct a test that simulates the high temperature that occurs during the atmospheric re-entry of the warhead by
fi ring the engine of the ballistic missile at the test object installed on a fi xed platform. Generally, it is diffi cult to recreate the circumstances of the atmospheric re-entry of the warhead by the emission
from the engine alone. It is necessary to conduct technology verifi cation by fl ight tests to conduct an accurate demonstration including the impact of the airfl ow, etc.

49 Further analysis is necessary to determine whether North Korea was able to demonstrate the warhead protection technology during atmospheric re-entry necessary for the operationalization of longrange ballistic missiles by the July 4, 2017 launch.

50 North Korea announced the implementation of the ground test for a “new type of large-output generator (engine) for ICBMs” in April 2016, the implementation of the ground test for a new type of


-----

Korea s intentions are not only research and development
of ballistic missiles but also the enhancement of their
operational capabilities. Since Chairman Kim Jong-un
has repeatedly instructed the military troops to reject
formality and conduct practical training, it can be
considered that these instructions underpin the launches
of ballistic missiles that have already been deployed.
North Korea also has claimed that a new type of
ballistic missile which appears to have been modifi ed
from the Scud missile launched on May 29, 2017 is a
“ballistic missile that incorporates a precision navigation
guidance system,” and it has also been noted that this
missile is equipped with a maneuverable re-entry vehicle
(MaRV). It is deemed that North Korea is aiming to
enhance the accuracy of attack by upgrading ballistic
missiles that have already been deployed.
Thirdly, North Korea appears to be seeking to
improve its ability to conduct surprise attacks by
enhancing secrecy and instantaneity to make it diffi cult
to detect signs of a launch. Using a TEL or submarine, a
ballistic missile can be launched from any point, making
it diffi cult to detect signs of a launch in advance. North
Korea has repeatedly launched ballistic missiles from
TELs and SLBMs. In addition, the SLBMs repeatedly
launched in 2016 and the ballistic missile presumed to
be modifi ed from the SLBM as a ground-launched type
and launched on February 12 and May 21, 2017 appear
to use solid fuel. It is thus possible that North Korea is
proceeding with the development of solid-fueled ballistic
missiles.[51] Generally solid fuel-propelled ballistic missiles
are pre-loaded with solid fuel, and therefore, they can be
launched instantly and the signs of their launch are more
diffi cult to detect. Furthermore, they can be reloaded
more quickly, and they are relatively easier to store and
handle in comparison to liquid fuel-propelled missiles. In
this respect, they are considered to be superior militarily.
From these factors, North Korea is deemed to be aiming
to enhance its surprise attack capabilities.
Fourthly, North Korea may be attempting to
diversify the forms of launches. It has been confi rmed


that at the June 22, 2016 Musudan launch and the May
14, July 4, July 28, and November 29, 2017 launches
of the ballistic missile, so-called lofted trajectories,
in which missiles are launched at higher angles than
nominal to high altitudes, were utilized. Generally, when
a launch is made on a lofted trajectory, interception is
considered to be more diffi cult.
Should North Korea make further progress in
the development of ballistic missiles, including the
verifi cation of reentry technologies, it may come to have
a one-sided understanding that it has secured strategic
deterrence against the United States. Should North Korea
have such a false sense of confi dence and recognition
regarding its deterrence, this could lead to increases and
the escalation of military provocations by North Korea
in the region and could create situations that are deeply
worrying also for Japan.
c. Future Outlook for Ballistic Missile Development
In his “New Year’s Address” in January 2018, Chairman
Kim Jong-un declared the historic accomplishment of
perfecting the national nuclear forces, and called for
“mass-production of nuclear warheads and ballistic
missiles, the power and reliability of which have already
been proved to the full, to give a spur to the efforts for
deploying them for action.” North Korea’s development
of long-range ballistic missiles has also been covered in
other publications, including the 2018 Nuclear Posture
Review (NPR) of the United States announced in February
2018, in which it was noted that “North Korea may now
be only months away from the capability to strike the
United States with nuclear-armed ballistic missiles.”
However, at the Plenary Meeting of the Central
Committee of the KWP in April 2018, Chairman
Kim Jong-un announced the suspension of ICBM test
launches. Then, at the U.S.-North Korea summit meeting
in June, he clearly expressed the intention to work
towards denuclearization. Given these developments it
will be necessary to continue to carefully monitor trends
in North Korea’s ballistic missile development program.


51 In addition, in images released together with reports by North Korean media about the visit of Chairman Kim Jong-un to the Chemical Material Institute of the Academy of Defense Science, a panel
could be seen featuring the name “Pukguksong-3,” which, in view of the name “Pukguksong,” has led some people to speculate that North Korea is developing a new type of solid fuel-propelled


-----

reporting the activities of Kim Kyong-hui, Secretary of
the KWP and Kim Jong-un’s aunt. Meanwhile, the North
Korean media began to report the activities of Chairman
Kim Jong-un’s younger sister, Kim Yo-jong, as a senior
member of the KWP.[53] These developments suggest that
a generational change in the leadership may be taking
place among the Kim dynasty.
At the KWP Congress held in May 2016, Kim
Jong-un was named to the new post of KWP Chairman.
In his report on the work of the KWP Central Committee,
the Chairman set out that North Korea was a “nuclear
weapons state,” and said the country would consistently
uphold the “Byungjin line” policy of economic
development and the building of nuclear force as well
as further boost its self-defensive nuclear force both
in quality and quantity. In this manner, the Chairman
demonstrated, both to those in and outside of the country,
North Korea’s readiness to continue with its nuclear and
missile development. Prior to the Congress, North Korea
conducted provocations at unprecedented frequency and
content, including the launch of ballistic missiles.
The holding of the KWP Congress may be an
indication that North Korea has shifted into high gear by
establishing the state-run governance system centered on
the party and led by KWP Chairman Kim Jong-un, in terms
of its organization, personnel, among other dimensions,
both in name and in substance.[54] At the Supreme People’s
Assembly session convened in June 2016, it was
decided that the National Defense Commission would
be turned into the State Affairs Commission, and KWP
Chairman Kim Jong-un was named Chairman of the
State Affairs Commission, the new “highest position”
of the “state” replacing First Chairman of the National
Defense Commission. These changes are also likely to be
manifestations of the governance system moving into full


4 Domestic Affairs


**(1) Developments Related to the Kim Jong-un Regime**
After the demise of Chairman of the National Defense
Commission Kim Jong-il in 2011, Kim Jong-un became
the de facto head of the military, party, and the state by
assuming the position of Supreme Commander of the
KPA, First Secretary of the KWP, and First Chairman of
the National Defense Commission by April 2012. The
framework of the Kim Jong-un regime was laid out in
a short period of time. Since the transition to the new
regime, there has been a number of announcements of
party-related meetings and decisions, and in May 2016,
the Seventh KWP Congress was held for the fi rst time
since the last Congress in October 1980, 36 years earlier.
These developments suggest that the state is run under
the leadership of the party. Meanwhile, Chairman Kim
Jong-un underscores the importance of military strength
and makes frequent visits to military organizations. In
this light, the Chairman is anticipated to continue to
attach importance to military strength.
Following the change in regime, Chairman Kim
Jong-un has conducted frequent personnel reshuffl es,
including reshuffl es of the top three military posts of
the Director of the General Political Bureau, the Chief
of the General Staff, and the Minister of the People’s
Armed Forces. In turn, individuals whom Chairman Kim
Jong-un selected were assigned to the key party, military,
and cabinet posts. In addition, in December 2013, Jang
Song-thaek, Vice-Chairman of the National Defense
Commission and Chairman Kim Jong-un’s uncle, was
executed for “plotting to overthrow the state.” It is believed
that through such measures, the Chairman endeavors
to strengthen and consolidate a monolithic leadership
system.[52] In 2014, the North Korean media stopped


52 Following the execution of Jang Song-thaek, Vice-Chairman of the National Defense Commission, the North Korean media repeatedly calls for the strengthening of the “monolithic leadership system”
and “single-minded unity.” For example, an editorial in the Rodong Sinmun dated January 10, 2014 urged the people to stay cautious even of trivial phenomena and elements which erode North
Korea’s single-minded unity. In May 2015, it was suggested that Hyon Yong-chol, Minister of the People’s Armed Forces, may have been executed on charges of treason. The ROK National Intelligence
Service reportedly briefed the National Assembly that the Minister was executed in late April 2015. In July 2015, the North Korean media introduced Pak Yong-sik, previous Deputy Director of the
General Political Bureau of the Korean People’s Army, with the title, Minister of the People’s Armed Forces. Additionally, since February 21, 2016, the North Korean media has introduced Ri Myong-su,
previous Minister of People’s Security, as Chief of General Staff Department instead of Ri Yong-gil. Ri Yong-gil was announced as an alternate member of the KWP Politburo at the KWP Congress in
May 2016.

53 According to the Korean Central Broadcasting Station, Kim Yo-jong was elected a member of the KWP Central Committee at the KWP Congress held in May 2016. The media has also shown her
supporting KWP Chairman Kim Jong-un on the podium during the celebration parade following the KWP Congress. In addition, at the Second Plenum of the Seventh KWP Congress in October 2017,
Kim Yo-jong was elected as an alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee.

54 Elections for members and alternate members of the KWP central leadership agencies (e.g., KWP Central Committee and KWP Politburo) were held during the KWP Congress. Pak Pong-ju, Premier,
and Choe Ryong-hae, KWP Secretary, were newly elected as KWP Politburo Standing Committee members to form a fi ve-member Standing Committee including: Kim Jong-un, KWP Chairman; Kim
Yong-nam, President of the Presidium of the Supreme People’s Assembly; and Hwang Pyong-so, Director of the General Political Bureau. All fi ve members of the KWP Politburo Standing Committee
are not genuine military personnel. Furthermore, the ranks of military personnel have fallen within the KWP Politburo, and Premier Pak Pong-ju has been added as a member of the KWP Central

swing.[55] However, with senior offi cials unable to dispute
the decisions of Chairman Kim Jong-un due to an atrophy
effect created by the frequent executions, demotions, and
dismissals of senior offi cials, it is believed that there is
growing uncertainty, including over the possibility of
North Korea turning to military provocations without
making adequate diplomatic considerations. In addition,
it has been suggested that there is declining social control
caused by widening wealth disparities and information
infl ow from other countries. In this regard, attention will
be paid to the stability of the regime.

**(2) Economic Conditions**
In the economic domain, North Korea has been facing
chronic stagnation and energy and food shortages in
recent years due to the vulnerability of its socialist
planned economy and diminishing economic cooperation
with the former Soviet Union and East European
countries following the end of the Cold War. Especially
for food, it is deemed that North Korea is still forced to
rely on food assistance from overseas.[56] Following North
Korea’s various provocations including the nuclear test in
January 2016 and launch of a ballistic missile disguised
as a “satellite” in February 2016, the ROK decided to
completely suspend operations at the Kaesong Industrial
Complex, which makes up over 99% of inter-Korean
trade. Furthermore, the strengthening of sanctions by
countries including Japan and the United States, and the
sanctions of the related UN Security Council resolutions
in response to the implementation of nuclear tests and
missile launches by North Korea can be assumed to have
had a certain effect, when considered together with the
severe economic situation of North Korea. Accordingly,
if China, North Korea’s largest trading partner, and other
relevant countries continue to rigorously implement


sanctions an even more severe economic situation could
beset North Korea.
To tackle a host of economic diffi culties, North
Korea has made attempts at limited improvement
measures and some changes to its economic management
systems,[57] and promotes the establishment of economic
development zones[58] and the enlargement of the
discretion of plants and other entities over production and
sales plans.[59] Furthermore, at the Plenary Meeting of the
Central Committee of the KWP in April 2018, in addition
to declaring the “Byungjin line” was successfully carried
out, North Korea declared that among other things, it
had determined to “concentrate all efforts on building a
powerful socialist economy and markedly improving the
standard of people’s living through the mobilization of
all human and material resources of the country.” These
all suggest that North Korea is placing importance on
rebuilding its economy. Nonetheless, North Korea is
unlikely to carry out any structural reforms that could
lead to the destabilization of its current ruling system,
and thus, various challenges confront the fundamental
improvement of its current economic situation.
In addition, the possibility has been noted that North
Korea could be evading the UNSC sanctions by engaging
in smuggling operations, and since the beginning of 2018,
MSDF assets patrol aircraft including have confi rmed
numerous cases in which North Korean-fl agged tankers
have drawn alongside foreign tankers in international
waters. After comprehensive analysis, the Government of
Japan has determined that there is a strong possibility that
these vessels have been conducting ship-to-ship transfers
in the high seas, which is forbidden under the terms of
UNSC resolutions.[60]

[See] Fig. I-2-2-5 (Sanctions against North Korea based on UN

Security Council Resolutions)


55 After the Supreme People’s Assembly session in June 2016, the media introduced the “Minister of the People’s Armed Forces,” who is considered equivalent to the minister of defense, as the “Minister
(Secretary) of the People’s Armed Forces,” raising the possibility that the Ministry of the People’s Armed Forces has been reorganized into the Ministry (Department) of the People’s Armed Forces.

56 In June 2017, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) designated North Korea as a country requiring external assistance for food.

57 For example, North Korea conducted a so-called currency revaluation ( decreasing the denomination of its currency) at the end of 2009. The currency revaluation is said to have led to economic
disorder, such as price escalation due to shortfall of supply, which in turn increased social unrest.

58 During the plenary meeting of the KWP Central Committee on March 31, 2013, KWP Chairman Kim Jong-un instructed the establishment of economic development zones in each province. Pursuant
to these instructions, the Economic Development Zone Law was enacted in May of that year. To date, 21 economic development zones have been established.

59 While the details of the policy are not necessarily clear, it is understood that in the industrial sector, entities would be able to independently make production decisions and conduct sales outside
the scope of the national plan, as well as determine employee remuneration and benefi ts based on the situation of the entities. In the agriculture sector, an autonomous business system would be
introduced at the household level. It has been said that 1,000 pyeong (1 pyeong = approx. 3.3 m2) of land would be allocated per person, with 40% of the agricultural products going to the state and
60% going to individuals.


-----

On June 12 the historic fi rst-ever U.S.-North Korea
summit meeting was held and both sides confi rmed
that they would join their efforts to build a lasting and
stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula. Chairman
Kim Jong-un made clear his intention to work towards
the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,
and confi rmed that negotiations would continue with
the United States. Furthermore, in a press conference
following the summit meeting, President Trump stated
that North Korea had agreed to destroy a missile engine
testing site. Based on the outcomes of the U.S.-North
Korea summit meeting it is now necessary to work closely
with the United States and the ROK and cooperate with
the international community, including China and Russia,
to elicit concrete actions from North Korea towards the
dismantlement of all weapons of mass destruction and
ballistic missiles of all ranges in a complete, verifi able
and irreversible manner.

**(2) Relations with the Republic of Korea**
The administration of President Moon Jae-in inaugurated
in May 2017 has expressed its position on North Korea
that, while putting emphasis on inter-Korean relations
through dialogue, it also indicated a stance of responding
resolutely through sanctions and pressure to provocations
by North Korea. In fact, based on the policy of responding
resolutely to provocations, in December 2017 the Moon
administration announced a new set of ROK sanctions
against North Korea. North Korea also continued to
engage in repeated provocative rhetoric and behavior
against the ROK, including a statement in October that if
war were to break out on the Korean Peninsula, the entire
ROK would be reduced to ashes. These events caused
inter-Korean tensions to rise.
On the other hand, in his “New Year’s Address” in
January 2018, Chairman Kim Jong-un indicated North
Korea’s desire to participate in the 2018 PyeongChang
Winter Olympic Games and demonstrated a willingness
to improve inter-Korean relations. Following this, on
January 9, a North-South High Level Offi cials’ Meeting
was held, and through frequent inter-Korean consultations
thereafter preparations were made for North Korea to
participate in the Winter Olympic Games. During the
Games, Kim Yo-jong visited the ROK, which was followed


5 Relations with Other Countries


**(1) Relations with the United States**
The U.S. Trump administration announced that it would
deal with North Korea’s nuclear and missile issue based
on the concept of “all options are on the table,” and
increased its presence in this region by means such as three
carrier strike groups, including a Ronald Reagan carrier
strike group conducting joint training in the Western
Pacifi c Ocean in November 2017. In addition, in the
Joint Statement by then Secretary of State Rex Tillerson,
Secretary of Defense James Mattis, and Director of
National Intelligence Dan Coats released in April, 2017,
it was declared that the U.S. policy towards North Korea
aims to pressure North Korea into dismantling its nuclear,
ballistic missile, and proliferation programs by tightening
economic sanctions and pursuing diplomatic measures
with its allies and regional partners. In August 2017, thenSecretary of State Tillerson and Defense Secretary Mattis
issued a joint statement, in which they reiterated that the
United States would apply pressure towards achieving
the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and that an
immediate cessation of nuclear and missile tests would
be required in order for the United States to enter into
negotiations with North Korea.
In response, North Korea repeated its previous
assertions that developing its own nuclear deterrent
capability was necessary in order to respond to the
nuclear threat posed by the United States, and continued
to engage in provocative rhetoric and behavior.[61] In
addition, North Korea reacted sharply to such actions
as U.S.-ROK combined exercises, alleging that such
activities were a manifestation of the “hostile policy”
of the U.S. towards North Korea and repeatedly voicing
strong criticism against the United States, coupled with
military provocations such as ballistic missile launches.[62]
On the other hand, in a meeting with a delegation headed
by a special envoy from the ROK in March 2018,
Chairman Kim Jong-un was reported as having expressed
understanding for U.S.-ROK joint exercises and noted
that he would be open to holding a U.S.-North Korea
meeting.[63] The United States also indicated that it would
be prepared to hold a meeting with North Korea on the
condition that North Korea would move to denuclearize.


61 For example, on August 8, 2017, a spokesperson for the KPA Strategic Rocket Forces announced that North Korea was carefully examining the operational plan for making an enveloping fi re in the
areas around Guam with its “medium- to long-range strategic ballistic rocket Hwasong-12.” In addition, in a statement by the Chairman of the State Affairs Commission on September 22, Chairman
Kim Jong-un noted that he was “giving serious consideration to exercising the highest level of hardline countermeasures in history.”

62 On this point, Rodong Sinmun dated March 24, 2017 states that “our Strategic Forces have also routinized ballistic rocket launch exercises” in response to the U.S.-ROK joint exercise.

63 According to an announcement by the ROK, in the meeting North Korea agreed to hold an inter-Korean summit meeting at the end of April and establish a hotline between the two leaders. In addition,
it was reported by the ROK that North Korea had indicated that it would have no reason to keep nuclear weapons if the military threat to the North was eliminated and its security guaranteed, that it
was prepared to engage in dialogue with the United States towards denuclearization and with a view to normalizing relations, and that while dialogue is ongoing it would not resume provocations such

Summary of recent UN Security Council resolutions on sanctions against North Korea


by a meeting in March between a delegation headed
by a special envoy from the ROK and Chairman Kim
Jong-un, which served to facilitate preparations for the
inter-Korean summit meeting. The inter-Korean summit
meeting was held on April 27, resulting in the issuance
of the Panmunjom Declaration, which confi rmed among
other matters that the two countries agreed to completely
cease all hostile acts against each other in every domain,
and confi rmed the common goal of realizing, through
complete denuclearization, a nuclear-free Korean
Peninsula. In addition, in a second inter-Korean summit
meeting held on May 26, Chairman Kim Jong-un
reiterated his desire for the complete denuclearization
of the Korean Peninsula. The Panmunjom Declaration
also notes that the two countries will aim to declare an
end to the Korean War[64] and that President Moon Jae-in


had agreed to visit Pyongyang in the autumn of 2018.
Future developments in inter-Korean relations will be
closely watched.

**(3) Relations with China**
The China-North Korea Treaty on Friendship,
Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, which was
concluded in 1961, is still in force.[65] In addition, China
is currently North Korea’s biggest trade partner. In
2016, trade volume between China and North Korea
was very large, accounting for approximately 90% of
North Korea’s total trade (excluding trade between
North Korea and the ROK),[66] suggesting North Korea’s
dependence on China.
With regard to the situation in North Korea and
its nuclear issue, China has expressed support for


64 The Korean War began in June 1950 and in July 1953 an armistice agreement was concluded. In the Panmunjom Declaration, the two countries announced that they would engage in consultations
with a view to declaring an end to the War by the end of this year, which is the 65th anniversary of the Armistice, and turning the armistice into a peace treaty.

65 It includes a provision that if either of the signatories (China and North Korea) is attacked and enters into a state of war, the other would make every effort to immediately provide military and
other assistance.


-----

**(4) Relations with Russia**
Concerning North Korea’s nuclear issue, Russia, along
with China, has expressed support for the denuclearization
on the Korean Peninsula and early resumption of the SixParty Talks. Following the sixth nuclear test conducted
by North Korea in September 2017, Russia condemned
North Korea’s nuclear test for violating UNSC
Resolutions, but also stated that measures that would
escalate tensions should be avoided. Nonetheless, Russia
approved UNSC Resolution 2375, which was adopted in
September 2017. Furthermore, although Russia endorsed
UNSC Resolution 2397, adopted in December 2017, it
emphasized that pressure on North Korea should make
way for dialogue and negotiations.
Following the U.S.-North Korea summit meeting
in June, Russia has continued to demonstrate an active
stance in supporting political and diplomatic processes
in the vicinity of the Korean Peninsula and has called on
relevant countries to give consideration to consultations
in a multilateral format.

**(5) Relations with Other Countries**
Since 1999, North Korea has made efforts to establish
relations with a series of West European countries
and others, including the establishment of diplomatic
relations with European countries[69] and participation in
the ARF ministerial meetings. Meanwhile, it has been
reported that North Korea has cooperative relationships
with countries such as Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Myanmar,
and Cuba in military affairs including arms trade and
military technology transfer.
In recent years, North Korea is deemed to be
strengthening its relations with African countries, with
North Korean senior offi cials paying visits to African
countries.[70] The underlying purposes for enhancing
relations with these countries include the usual objective
of deepening political and economic cooperation. In
addition, it appears that North Korea hopes to acquire
foreign currency by expanding its arms trade and military


denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula, for peace and
stability on the Korean Peninsula, and solving problems
through dialogue and consultations. While it has endorsed
the series of UNSC Resolutions, which strengthen
sanctions on North Korea.[67] It has also stated that
sanctions alone will be unable to achieve a fundamental
solution to the nuclear issue and that a solution should
be found through dialogue and consultations. On this
point China has repeatedly referred to “dual suspension,”
by which it means that North Korea should temporarily
suspend nuclear and missile test activities and that the
United States and the ROK should temporarily suspend
joint military exercises.
China is a vital political and economic partner for
North Korea and maintains a degree of infl uence on the
country. Although it has been noted that China-North
Korea relations had deteriorated due to North Korea’s
repeated nuclear and ballistic missile tests, in March 2018
the fi rst-ever China-North Korea summit meeting under
the leadership of Chairman Kim Jong-un was held,[68] in
which the two leaders agreed to further develop bilateral
relations and also for President Xi Jinping to make a visit
to North Korea. Chairman Kim Jong-un made another
visit to China in May and held a second meeting with
President Xi, in which it is reported that issues such as the
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula were discussed.
Chairman Kim Jong-un made a third visit to China in
June, and is believed to have explained the outcomes of
the U.S.-North Korea summit meeting to President Xi
and engaged in an exchange of opinions. On the other
hand, North Korea does not necessarily adopt actions
which are in line with the position of China over nuclear
and ballistic missile issues. Furthermore, China has
opposed the implementation of excessive sanctions on
North Korea that could lead to destabilizing the Korean
Peninsula. Given such circumstances, North Korea-China
relations and China’s infl uence on North Korea require
continued attention.


67 On January 5, 2018, the Ministry of Commerce of China announced that based on UNSC Resolution 2397, China would implement measures from January 6, including restrictions on export of crude
oil to North Korea and restrictions on export of refi ned petroleum products.

68 According to a statement released by China, in the China-North Korea summit meeting Chairman Kim Jong-un stated that the issue of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula could be realized if
the ROK and the United States would take phased measures in step with North Korea in order to realize peace and reconciliation. This visit to China was the fi rst overseas visit made by Chairman Kim
Jong-un since assuming the leadership of North Korea.

69 For example, the United Kingdom and Germany established diplomatic relations with North Korea in 2000 and 2001, respectively.

70 For example, in May 2016, President of the Presidium of the Supreme People’s Assembly Kim Yong-nam attended the inauguration ceremony of the President of Equatorial Guinea. He held talks with
the President, as well as with the leaders of the Republic of Chad, the Gabonese Republic, the Central African Republic, the Republic of Congo, the Republic of Guinea, and the Republic of Mali who

cooperation with African countries – activities which are
becoming increasingly diffi cult due to sanctions based on
UN Security Council resolutions and political turmoil in
the Middle East.
It is actually the case that transactions that violate
the terms of UNSC Resolutions have been observed,[71]
and the possibility that North Korea’s illegal activities
could provide a funding source for nuclear and ballistic
missile development is a cause for concern. At the same
time, however, following the adoption of the series of
UNSC Resolutions in 2017, various countries in Europe,

2 The Republic of Korea and the U.S. Forces Korea


Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, and Southeast Asia
are reviewing their diplomatic and economic relations
with North Korea.[72]

In February 2017, a North Korean man was murdered
in Malaysia and the Malaysian Government later
confi rmed that the man was Kim Jong-nam. The Malaysia
police also announced that VX, whose production and
use are banned by the Convention on the Prohibition of
the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of
Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction (Chemical
Weapons Convention), was detected from his body.

2 Defense Policies and Defense Reform of the ROK


The ROK has a defensive weakness, namely, its capital
Seoul, which has a population of approximately 10
million, is situated close to the DMZ. The ROK has set
the National Defense Objective as follows: “to protect the
country from external military threats and invasions, to
support peaceful unifi cation, and to contribute to regional
stability and world peace.” As one of the “external
military threats,” the ROK, in its Defense White Paper,
used to designate North Korea as the “main enemy.”
However, the ROK presently uses the expression, “the
North Korean regime and its armed forces…will remain
as our enemies.”[73]
The ROK has continued to undertake reforms of
its national defense.[74] In recent years, in August 2012,
in light of the sinking of the ROK patrol boat and the
bombardment of Yeonpyeong in 2010, the Defense
Reform Basic Plan (2012-2030) was released by the
Ministry of National Defense of the ROK,[75] which
included enhancing deterrence capabilities against North
Korea and making the military even more effi cient. In
March 2014, the Defense Reform Basic Plan (2014

1 General Situation


In May 2017, the Moon Jae-in administration was
inaugurated in the ROK. With regard to its North Korea
policy, while on the one hand the administration announced
that it would put emphasis on improving inter-Korean
relations through dialogue, it also indicated a stance of
responding resolutely through sanctions and pressure to
provocations by North Korea. How the North Korea policy
of the Moon administration will impact inter-Korean
relations will continue to require close attention.
The U.S. Forces, mainly the Army, have been
stationed in the ROK since the ceasefi re of the Korean
War. The ROK has established very close security
arrangements with the United States primarily based on
the U.S.-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty. The U.S. Forces
Korea have been playing an important role in securing
peace and stability of the region such as playing a vital
role in deterring the outbreak of large-scale armed confl ict
on the Korean Peninsula.


71 The fi nal report of the UN Security Council’s Panel of Experts assisting the North Korea Sanctions Committee released in March 2018 makes references to the export of weapons and related military
equipment to Eritrea, the export of surface-to-air missiles to Mozambique, and the repair and renewal of surface-to-air missile systems and air defense radar in Tanzania.

72 For example, in September 2017, Spain recalled its ambassador to North Korea, and Italy followed suit in October. In September the Philippines announced that it would cease trading with North
Korea. Furthermore, in November Sudan announced that it had ceased all transactions with North Korea and in October Uganda announced that it had expelled all persons related to the North Korean
military or weapons-related companies.

73 The ROK’s Defense White Paper 2016 describes North Korea as follows: “[T]he constant military threats and provocations from North Korea are the primary security threats the ROK faces today. In
particular, North Korea’s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) including nuclear weapons and missiles, cyber-attacks and terrorism pose major threats to our national security. As long as these threats
persist, the North Korean regime and its military will remain an enemy insofar as they are the agents carrying out these threats.”

74 Under the Act concerning National Defense Reform passed in 2006, the Defense Reform Basic Plan must analyze and evaluate changes in the situation and the results of the promotion of national
defense reform and be revised and supplemented, even after its establishment.

75 The ROK Ministry of National Defense states that in order to convert the ROK Forces into an “order-made military structure” that matches the operational environment on the Korean Peninsula, it
will signifi cantly expand response capabilities in the Northwestern Islands area, reorganize the senior command structure in preparation for the transfer of wartime operational command, gradually
proceed with the reduction and reorganization of the troops, and signifi cantly expand response capabilities against missiles and cyberwarfare, etc. In order to build a “high-effi ciency developed
country-type national defense operation structure,” it will also promote effi ciency, reorganize the human resources control structure, enhance the welfare of the military, and improve the military

2030) was unveiled,[76] which included in its scope the
long-term development of defense capabilities in order
to respond to potential threats after the unifi cation of the
Korean Peninsula while securing response capabilities
against the threat from North Korea. In February 2017,
it announced the Defense Reform Basic Plan (20142030) (rev.1), which, while maintaining the objectives
and underlying tone of Defense Reform Basic Plan
(2014-2030), emphasizes having readiness capability for
simultaneous local provocations and all-out war, while
giving top priority to bolstering the organization and
military power for responding to nuclear, missile and
other asymmetrical threats from North Korea.

3 Military Posture of the ROK


The ROK’s military capacity is as follows. The ground
forces consist of 22 army divisions and 2 marine divisions,
totaling 520,000 personnel; the naval forces consist of
240 vessels with a total displacement of approximately
215,000 tons; and the air forces (Air Force and Navy
combined) consist of approximately 640 combat aircraft.
The ROK has been modernizing its military forces—
not only its Army but also its Navy and Air Force—in
order to establish an omnidirectional defense posture to
deal with future potential threats, not least threats from
North Korea. The Navy has been introducing submarines,
large transport ships, and domestically built destroyers.
The Air Force is currently promoting a program for the
installation of the F-35A as a next-generation fi ghter with
stealth property.
In November 2017, the ROK Government announced
a revision of its missile guidelines, which stipulate the


range of ballistic missiles it possesses; the revision
included the elimination of warhead weight limit
restrictions on ballistic missiles, in order to enhance the
deterrence against military provocation by North Korea.[77]
Furthermore, to address North Korean nuclear and missile
threats, in addition to expanding the missile capabilities
of the ROK Forces,[78] the ROK is engaging in efforts to
build a Korean-type three-axis system, comprised of the
following elements: a system known as “Kill Chain” to
conduct swift preemptive strikes using missiles and other
assets,[79] the indigenous missile defense system (Korea Air
and Missile Defense [KAMD]),[80] and the Korea Massive
Punishment & Retaliation (KMPR) concept.[81]

In recent years, the ROK has actively promoted
equipment export, which reached approximately US$3.2
billion on a contract value basis in 2015. Since 2006, the
amount has increased by nearly 13-fold in 11 years. It
is reported that export items have diversifi ed to include
communication electronics, aircraft, and naval vessels.[82]

Defense spending in FY2018 (regular budget)

4 U.S.-ROK Alliance and U.S. Forces Korea


The United States and the ROK have taken various steps
to deepen the U.S.-ROK Alliance in recent years.
While regularly confi rming the strengthening of
the U.S.-ROK Alliance at the summit level, as specifi c
undertakings, the two countries signed the U.S.-ROK
Counter-Provocation Plan for dealing with North Korea’s


76 The ROK Ministry of National Defense plans to introduce an additional three Aegis-class cruisers, develop next-generation destroyers and submarines, and introduce medium- and high-altitude
reconnaissance drones and multipurpose satellites in order to secure response capabilities against existing and potential threats.

77 The missile guidelines were established to restrict the range and warhead weight of ballistic missiles possessed by the ROK and were agreed by the governments of the United States and the ROK in
1979. They were subsequently revised in 2001 and 2012. In the previous guidelines, which were last revised in 2012, provisions included, for example, that ballistic missiles with a maximum range
of 800 km should have a maximum warhead weight of 500 kg.

78 In April 2012, the ROK Ministry of National Defense announced that the country has developed and already fi elded missiles that include cruise missiles able to strike throughout North Korea. In
February 2013, the ministry indicated that it would accelerate the development of 800 km-range ballistic missiles, possession of which was made possible by the revision of the missile guidelines in
October 2012, and announced that it has fi elded cruise missiles to be launched from vessels or submarines and capable of attacking the entire area of North Korea. Also in October, during an event
commemorating the 65th anniversary of the founding of the armed forces, the ROK Forces displayed to the public for the fi rst time the “Hyeonmu 2” ballistic missile, which is said to have a 300 km
range, and the “Hyeonmu 3” surface-to-surface cruise missile, which is said to have a 1,000 km range. The ROK conducted successful test launches of a new ballistic missile with a range of 500 km
in April 2014 and a new ballistic missile with a range of 800 km in June 2017.

79 The ROK Ministry of National Defense explains that the system is capable of detecting and identifying signs of missile launch, determining attack, and actual attacking instantaneously. In the ROK’s
Defense White Paper 2016, it is explained that in order to construct the “Kill Chain,” in addition to enhancing monitoring and surveillance capabilities through the use of high-altitude reconnaissance
unmanned aerial vehicles and military reconnaissance satellites, the ROK is enhancing strike capacity by securing extra surface-to-surface missiles, long-range air-to-surface missiles, and Joint
Attack Direct Munitions (JADM).

80 The ROK Ministry of National Defense has denied participation in the U.S. missile defense system, and has underscored that the ROK was creating its own indigenous systems. The reported reasons
include differences in threat perceptions between the United States and the ROK, concern over Chinese backlash, and cost effectiveness.

81 The ROK Ministry of National Defense website states that “KMPR, the third axis, is a Korean-type massive retaliation concept, a system in which counterattacks are conducted by directly aiming at
the North Korean leadership including its war command headquarters, in the case where North Korea threatens with its nuclear weapons,” and “missile and other strike forces capable of delivering
simultaneous and massive precision strikes and elite professional special operation forces, etc. will be operated for this purpose.” In December 2017 it was reported that a 1,000 personnel “special
duties brigade” had been newly formed, which would be tasked with the duty of eliminating the North Korean leadership, and was expected to form a major element in the KMPR concept.

82 As for recent examples, in 2012, the ROK concluded an agreement to export three Type 209 submarines to Indonesia as well as an agreement to export four of the new Military Afl oat Reach and
Sustainability (MARS) vessels to the United Kingdom. In 2014, the ROK concluded an agreement to export 12 FA-50 light attack aircraft to the Philippines. Most recently, in 2017 the ROK exported

provocations in March 2013,[83] and approved the Tailored
Deterrence Strategy, designed to enhance deterrence
against North Korean nuclear and other WMD threats, at
the 45th Security Consultative Meeting (SCM) in October
of the same year.[84] At the 46th SCM in October 2014,
the two countries agreed on “Concepts and Principles
of ROK-U.S. Alliance Comprehensive Counter-missile
Operations (4D Operational Concept)” to tackle North
Korean ballistic missile threats. At the 47th SCM in
November 2015, the implementation guidance on the 4D
Operational Concept was approved.[85] Additionally, after
North Korea went ahead with its nuclear test in January
2016, the United States and the ROK began formal talks
regarding deployment of THAAD[86] to U.S. Forces Korea
in February 2016 and offi cially decided in July to deploy
them. At the end of April 2017 part of the THAAD
system was deployed to the designated site for operations
and in September four additional launching pads were
deployed, concluding the temporary deployment of
THAAD. In addition, in a U.S.-ROK summit meeting
also held in September, the enhanced deployment of U.S.
strategic assets in and around the ROK on a rotational
basis was agreed. Furthermore, it was reported that in
the regular U.S.-ROK joint military exercise conducted
in April 2018, around 300,000 ROK Forces personnel


and around 23,700 U.S. Forces personnel participated, as
well as amphibious assault ships and F-35B fi ghters. In
June the U.S. Department of Defense announced that the
U.S.-ROK joint military exercise “Freedom Guardian”
planned for August had been suspended, along with two
U.S.-ROK Marine Exchange Program training exercises
scheduled to occur within the next three months.
At the same time, the two countries have worked to
deal with such issues as the transition of OPCON to the
ROK[87] and the realignment of U.S. Forces Korea. For
the transition of OPCON to the ROK, the roadmap for
the transfer “Strategic Alliance 2015” was established
in October 2010. Aiming to complete the transition by
December 1, 2015, the two countries have reviewed the
approach of transitioning from the existing combined
defense arrangement of the U.S. and ROK Forces, to a
new joint defense arrangement led by the ROK Forces
and supported by the U.S. Forces. Nevertheless, based
on the increasing seriousness of North Korea’s nuclear
and missile threats, the two sides decided at the 46th
SCM to re-postpone the transition of OPCON, and to
adopt a conditions-based approach, i.e., implementing
the transition when conditions such as the ROK Forces’
enhanced capabilities are met. The three-axis system,
which is deemed to be the central challenge for enhancing


83 The ROK Joint Chiefs of Staff has announced that the plan contains consultative procedures as well as robust and thorough response methodologies for the United States and the ROK to take joint
responses in the event of a North Korean provocation. However, the details of the plan have not been made public.

84 According to the Joint Communiqué of the 45th ROK-U.S. SCM, this strategy establishes a strategic framework for tailoring deterrence against key North Korean threat scenarios across armistice and
wartime, and strengthens the partnership between the United States and the ROK to maximize their deterrent effects. However, the details have not been made public.

85 According to the Joint Communiqué of the 46th SCM, the “Concepts and Principles” are designed to detect, defend, disrupt, and destroy missile threats including nuclear and biochemical warheads.
However, the details have not been made public. Furthermore, according to the “Strategic Digest 2015” of the U.S. Forces in the ROK, the “Concepts and Principles” apply from peacetime to war, and
will guide operational decision-making, planning, exercises, capability development, and acquisitions.

outside of the atmosphere or in the upper atmosphere. See Part III, Chapter 1, Section 2 regarding the ballistic missile defense system.

87 The United States and the ROK have had the U.S.-ROK Combined Forces Command since 1978 in order to operate the U.S.-ROK combined defense system to deter wars on the Korean Peninsula and
to perform effective combined operations in the case of a contingency. Under the U.S.-ROK combined defense system, OPCON over the ROK Forces is to be exercised by the Chairman of the Korea

completion in the early 2020s. At the 49th Security
Consultative Meeting (SCM) in October 2017, it was
decided that the United States and the ROK would jointly
supplement the conditions-based OPCON transfer plan
by the time of the next meeting. Future developments will
continue to be monitored.
With regard to the realignment of the U.S. Forces
Korea,[88] an agreement had been reached in 2003 on the
relocation of the U.S. Forces’ Yongsan Garrison located
in the center of Seoul to the Pyeontaek area, south of
Seoul, and on the relocation of the U.S. Forces stationed
north of the Han River to the south of the river.
Subsequently, however, the agreement has been
partially revised, due to various factors, including: the
relocation to the Pyeontaek area being delayed due to
logistical reasons such as increases in relocation costs; in
relation to the postponement of the transition of OPCON,
it has been necessary for some U.S. Forces personnel to
remain at Yongsan Garrison; and it was decided that the
counter-fi res forces of U.S. Forces Korea would remain
in their location north of the Han River to counter the
threat of North Korea’s long-range rocket artillery. In July
2017 the U.S. Eighth Army headquarters relocated to the
Pyeontaek area, and in June 2018 the headquarters of U.S.
Forces Korea and United Nations Command also relocated
to the same area. The realignment of U.S. Forces Korea
could have a signifi cant impact on U.S. and ROK defense
postures on the Korean Peninsula, and as such it will be
necessary to follow future developments closely.

5 Relations with Other Countries


**(1) Relations with China**
China and the ROK have made continuous efforts to
strengthen their relations. Meanwhile, outstanding issues
have emerged between China and the ROK.
The “East China Sea Air Defense Identifi cation
Zone” (ADIZ) issued by China in November 2013


overlapped in some areas with the ROK s ADIZ.
Furthermore, it included the airspace above the sea areas
surrounding the reef, Ieodo (Chinese name: Suyan Rock),
regarding which China and the ROK have confl icting
claims to the jurisdictional authority over the exclusive
economic zone. Against this backdrop, the ROK
Government announced the expansion of its own ADIZ
in December 2013 and enforced it from the same month.
In addition, China has protested that the deployment of
THAAD to U.S. Forces Korea would undermine China’s
strategic security interests. On this point, in October 2017
the governments of China and the ROK announced that
they had agreed to utilize military channels to reach a
mutual understanding relating to China’s concerns about
THAAD. In December 2017 President Moon Jae-in
made his fi rst visit to China since his inauguration and
the two leaders agreed to establish a hotline and continue
to maintain close communication, as well as vitalizing
high-level strategic dialogue.

**(2) Relations with Russia**
Military exchanges have been under way between the
ROK and Russia in recent years, including exchanges
among high-ranking military offi cials. The two countries
have also agreed on cooperation in the areas of military
technology, defense industry, and military supplies. In
2008, they agreed to upgrade the bilateral relations to
a “strategic cooperative partnership.” In March 2012,
the two countries held the fi rst ROK-Russia defense
strategic dialogue and agreed to regularize the dialogue.
In November 2013, President Vladimir Putin visited the
ROK, and a joint statement was issued in which the two
sides agreed to strengthen dialogue in the areas of politics
and security.
On the other hand, Russia opposes the deployment
of THAAD by U.S. Forces Korea for the reason that it is
part of the U.S. missile defense network and harms the
strategic stability of the region.


88 The United States intends to consolidate and relocate the bases of the U.S. Forces Korea which are scattered across the ROK, in order to ensure stable stationing conditions for U.S. Forces Korea and
a balanced development of ROK land. The agreement between the United States and the ROK include: (1) an agreement to conduct the relocation to south of the Han River in two stages (June 2003);
and (2) the withdrawal of 12,500 of the nearly 37,500 personnel out of the ROK (October 2004). The United States has thus been transforming its posture in accordance with these agreements.
However, at the U.S.-ROK Summit Meeting in April 2008, the two countries agreed to maintain the current 28,500 as the appropriate troop level. Since then, the two countries have continued to affi rm

**Section 3 China**


1 General Situation

China, the world’s most populous country, has a vast
landmass surrounded by a long borderline shared with
14 countries as well as a long coastline. China is also a
nation with various races, religions, and languages. China,
with a long history, has been shaping and maintaining
a distinct culture and civilization. China’s pride in its
unique history and semi-colonial experience in and after
the 19th century are driving its desire for a strong nation
and fueling its nationalism.
In recent years, China has increased its presence
in the international community. For example, China
takes a proactive stance towards efforts in nontraditional security areas, making personnel and
fi nancial contributions to UN PKOs and sending its
ships continuously for counter-piracy activities off the
coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden. Furthermore,
China has participated proactively in humanitarian
assistance and disaster relief activities. These activities
have been highly appreciated by the international
community. There continues to be high expectations for
China to recognize its responsibility in the international
community, accept and comply with international
norms, and play an active role in a more cooperative
manner on regional and global issues.
China faces various problems domestically
including human rights issues. The spread of bribery
and corruption among the central and local leadership
of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has become a
signifi cant political problem. Furthermore, China’s rapid
economic growth has brought with it emerging problems
such as regional disparities between urban-rural and
coastal inland regions, the issue of the tax system that
facilitates these disparities, wealth gaps among urban
residents, infl ation, environmental pollution, and lack of
agricultural and industrial water. More recently, China
has tended to slowdown[1] in its economic growth. In the
future, China is also expected to face issues associated
with the rapid aging of the population, including pension
and other issues related to the social security system.
The Chinese Government has been tightening its control
over society as these potentially destabilizing factors to


the government administration expand and diversify.
However, it is suggested that controlling activities of the
masses becomes increasingly diffi cult with the spread
of the Internet, coupled with other factors. Additionally,
China confronts issues concerning ethnic minorities in
the country, with their staging protests and carrying out
campaigns in pursuit of separation and independence
in the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Xinjiang Uyghur
Autonomous Region, and elsewhere. In the meantime,
since 2014, China enacted laws that covers not only
security from external threats, but also includes culture
and society as a part of security. Those laws include
the Anti-Spy Law in November 2014, a new National
Security Law in July 2015, an Anti-Terrorism Law in
January 2016 to strengthen state control, a strengthened
Law on Management of Domestic Activities of Overseas
Non-governmental Organizations in January 2017, and
the National Intelligence Law in June 2017 to strengthen
domestic espionage prevention mechanisms under its
“holistic view of national security.”
The “anti-corruption” movement following the
launch of the Xi Jinping leadership has made inroads under
the policy of cracking down on both “tigers” and “fl ies,”
with severe charges of corruption on people including
prominent leaders of the Party and military, such as
Politburo Standing Committee member Zhou Yongkang,


According to an announcement by the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the growth rate of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the full year of 2017 was 6.9% compared to the previous year.

former CPC Politburo member Sun Zhengcai, former
CMC Vice Chairmen Guo Boxiong and Xu Caihou, and
former CMC members Zhang Yang and Fang Fenghui. In
his remarks at the 19th National Congress of the CPC in
October 2017, General Secretary Xi spoke about “strict
governance over the Party,” stating that “corruption is the
greatest threat our Party faces” as well as suggesting that
he will continue to crack down on corruption within the
Party and the military.
Through these developments, the Party has
demonstrated its intention and made unprecedented
efforts in recent years to further bolster the power
foundations of General Secretary Xi in the CPC. For
example, it was decided at the 19th National Congress
to incorporate the “thoughts,” namely the political
philosophy, under the name of General Secretary Xi
Jinping into the Party constitution as a guideline. This
was the fi rst time since Chairman Mao Zedong that a

and ensure law-based governance on the military.
The Chinese military leadership has emphasized to
continue to improve the Chinese militery’s operational
capabilities, exhibiting the results of its recent 5-year
activities such as the “struggle” against the Senkaku
Island, which is an inherent territory of Japan, the
establishment of the “East China Sea Air Defense
Identifi cation Zone (ADIZ),” and its Navy and Air Force’s
“regular patrols.”[2] Although it is not necessarily clear
what specifi c activities these examples indicate, there is a
high probability that it is not only planning to make such
activities routine, but also further expand and intensify
them both qualitatively and quantitatively, given that the
Chinese military is rapidly expanding and intensifying
activities in the areas surrounding Japan, such as the East
China Sea and western Pacifi c Ocean. The policy stated
at the 19th National Congress in October 2017 to speed
up by 15 years the achievement of the third stage of the
“three-stage development strategy” was declared in the
past, can be considered a decision based on development
exceeding China’s own assumptions on the pace of the
modernization of the military and military activities. It is
possible that military modernization efforts to strengthen
the practical operational capabilities of the military will
be further accelerated, considering General Secretary Xi


1 General Situation

For over the past 25 years, China has sustained large
increases in its defense budget, and has broadly and
rapidly reinforced its military forces, mainly its nuclear
and missile forces as well as its Navy and Air Force.
Along with such efforts, it is understood that China is
strengthening its so-called “A2/AD” capabilities.
In addition to traditional strengthening of military
capabilities, over the past few years, in particular, China
has been trying to develop a new form of practical
operational capabilities. The military reforms with a
goal of creating a practical military, have been steadily
and rapidly making progress since its beginning at the
end of December 2015. Among them, China emphasizes
information warfare to securely obtain information
superiority as one of its asymmetric military capabilities.
China is considered to be rapidly developing its
capabilities in electronic warfare and cyberspace with the
aim of confusing enemy command systems in confl ict
situations. In addition, China is working to improve joint
operational capabilities, enhance capabilities for distant
power projection, conduct practical training, cultivate and
acquire personnel for operations of informatized forces,
improve the foundation of its domestic defense industry,

China, particularly over maritime issues where its
interests confl ict with others, continues to act in an assertive
manner[3] based on its own assertions incompatible with the
existing international order, including attempts to change
the status quo by coercion, where there is a potential
danger to lead to unexpected situations. Additionally, as
for the acts to change the status quo by coercion, China
remains poised to fulfi ll its unilateral demands without
compromise, including making steady efforts to turn its
acts into faits accompli.
At the same time, China recently has also shown
interest in efforts to avoid and prevent unexpected
contingencies in sea areas and in airspace.
Considering these situations, there is a strong
concern, in international society including Japan, over
the issues including the rapid modernization of the
military capabilities and improvement of the operational
capabilities as well as the following China’s unilateral
escalation of activities surrounding Japan, together
with the lack of transparency in its military and security
affairs. Accordingly, it is necessary to pay close attention
to the issues.

2 Defense Policies


China regards that the buildup of strong defense capabilities
and powerful military forces constitutes a strategic mission
to modernize the state, and that it ensures the security of
the state under “peaceful development.” China considers
the main goal and mission of national defense policies
as: to adapt to the new changes in security environment;
to accomplish the strategic guideline of active defense[4]
to realize the CCP’s goal of building a strong military; to
accelerate the modernization of national defense and the
military forces; to fi rmly protect its national sovereignty,
security, and interests as a result of development; and
to provide strong assurances for realizing the “Chinese
dream” of the great revival of the peoples of China. China
contends that these defense policies are defensive in
nature.[5] Furthermore, China seems to emphasize not only
physical means but also non-physical means in military


affairs and warfare. It has incorporated the concept of
“Three Warfares” — “Media Warfare,” “Psychological
Warfare,” and “Legal Warfare” — into the tasks of the
political work of the military. In addition, China has set
forth a policy of close coordination of military struggle
with political, diplomatic, economic, cultural, and legal
endeavors.
China has employed a policy to ensure to establish
the “system of modern military power with Chinese
characteristics,” aiming at informatizing the military
based on its military strategy to follow the development
trend of the military all over the world observed in the
Gulf War, the Kosovo War, the Iraq War and so on, and
to win informatized local wars. Dealing with a Taiwan
contingency is believed to be a top priority in China’s
efforts to strengthen the military forces; more specifi cally,
improving its capabilities to hinder the independence of
Taiwan and foreign military support for it. Furthermore,
in recent years, China is working actively to acquire
capabilities for missions other than dealing with a Taiwan
contingency, and is steadily enhancing operational
capabilities in more distant waters.
As for future indicators of the modernization of the
military, in his remarks to the 19th National Congress in
October 2017, General Secretary Xi Jinping proclaimed
the goals of seeing that mechanization is basically
achieved, IT application has come a long way and
strategic capabilities have seen a big improvement by the



**[KEY WORD]**

Three Warfares

China amended the Regulations of the PLA on the Political Work in

December 2003 to add Media, Psychological, and Legal Warfares to the

PLA’s mission. They are collectively referred to as the “Three Warfares.”

U.S. DoD explains these warfares as follows: (1) Media Warfare is

aiming at infl uencing domestic and international public opinion to build

public and international support for China’s military actions and to
dissuade an adversary from pursuing policies perceived to be adverse

to China’s interests; (2) Psychological Warfare seeks to undermine an

enemy’s ability to conduct combat operations through psychological
operations aimed at deterring, shocking, and demoralizing enemy

military and supporting civilian personnels; and (3) Legal Warfare

uses international and domestic laws to gain international support and

manage possible repercussions of China’s military actions.


For example, regarding the so-called “nine-dash line” asserted by China in the South China Sea, “historic rights” claimed by China were rejected by the Philippines-China arbitration (July 2016). Also,
in recent years, China continues to use its own interpretations, such as those of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). It has been noted that China is developing arguments
that attempt to restrict reportedly military activities of other countries in its exclusive economic zone (EEZ). For instance, the Chinese government announced in a statement by the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs on November 26, 2010 that it opposed to unsanctioned military activities by any country in China’s EEZs.

The strategic concept of active defense is seen as the essence of the CCP’s military strategic concept. It upholds the principles of defense, self-defense, and “post-emptive strike” (suppress the
adversary after it attacks), and maintains that “We will not attack unless we are attacked, but we will surely counterattack if attacked.”

year 2020, that by 2035 the modernization of its national
defense and its forces is basically completed, and that
by the mid-21st century the people’s armed forces have
been fully transformed into world-class forces. These
goals are said to be ahead of the target of the third stage
of the “Three Stage Development Strategy,” namely
the basic modernization of the national defense and the
forces by the middle of the 21st century, and it appears
that on further acceleration of military power is to be
seen as China’s power grows.


transparency is declining, China has not yet achieved the
levels of transparency expected of a responsible nation in
the international community.
Incidents have been occurring that incite concerns
over China’s military decision-making and actions,
including Chinese explanations different from the actual
facts. For example, details have yet to be disclosed
regarding the causes of the Chinese nuclear-powered
submarine’s submerged navigation in Japan’s territorial
waters in November 2004 although it constitutes a breach
of international law. Furthermore, with respect to the
incidents such as that of a Chinese naval vessel directing
its fi recontrol radar at an MSDF destroyer in January
2013, both the Chinese Ministry of National Defense
and Ministry of Foreign Affairs gave explanations which
were inconsistent with the facts; in this case they have
denied the use of the radar itself. With regard to the
incident in which Chinese fi ghters fl ew abnormally close
to MSDF and ASDF aircraft (May and June 2014), the
Chinese Ministry of National Defense gave explanations
that were contrary to the truth; it claimed that Japanese
aircraft “entered the airspace for the Chinese drills
without reporting to China and conducted dangerous
acts.” Particularly in 2016, China repeatedly made claims
that are contrary to the fact. In the case where SDF aircraft
scrambled against Chinese aircraft, China claimed that
the SDF aircraft “conducted interference at close distance
and shot IR fl ares, endangering the safety of the Chinese
aircraft and its crew.”[9] The submerged transit of a Chinese
Navy submarine through Japan’s contiguous zone around
the Senkaku Islands was confi rmed in January 2018, but
China did not acknowledge this.[10] In recent years, amid
the signifi cant changes in the environment surrounding
the China’s military, including advances in military
specialization and diversifi cation of missions associated
with military strengthening, some see that relations
between the CCP leadership and the PLA have become
increasingly complex. Others opine that the military’s
infl uential power on foreign policy decisions has been
changing. Attention is to be paid to such situations also in
terms of crisis management.


3 Military Transparency


China has not disclosed specifi c information such as
possession of weapons, procurement goals and past
procurements, organization and locations of major units,
records of main military operations and exercises, and
a detailed breakdown of its national defense budget.
Moreover, China has neither set out a clear and specifi c
future vision of its military strengthening, nor ensured
adequate transparency of its decision-making process in
relation to military and security affairs.
China has released defense white papers including
“China’s National Defense” nearly every two years
since 1998. China also conducts numerous dialogues
with national defense authorities of other countries.[6] A
spokesperson at the Chinese Ministry of National Defense
has been giving monthly press conferences since April
2011. In November 2013, the position of spokesperson
was newly established at seven departments, including
the Navy and Air Force.[7] Such moves can be perceived on
the one hand as efforts that contribute to the improvement
of the transparency of military forces, but on the other
hand as efforts to strengthen “Media Warfare.”
However, China has not provided a detailed
breakdown of its national defense spending.[8] Moreover,
in China’s defense white papers released after 2013, the
contents have included limited topics. The papers has
made no reference to national defense spending that
was described in previous defense white papers, and
the overall description has decreased. In this respect, as


6 See Part III, Chapter 2, Section 1-4 for examples of dialogue with Japan.

7 The seven departments are: then PLA General Political Department; then PLA General Logistics Department; then PLA General Armaments Department; PLA Navy; PLA Air Force; then PLA Second
Artillery Corps; and People’s Armed Police.

8 The defense white papers “China’s National Defense in 2008” and “China’s National Defense in 2010” provided a breakdown of personnel expenses, training and maintenance costs, and equipment
costs for the active force, reserve force, and militia, limited to the FY2007 and FY2009 defense budget expenditures, respectively, but has not offered an explanation of them recently.

9 For example, on December 10, 2016, the Chinese Ministry of National Defense announced, “When Chinese Air Force aircraft mobilized for regular blue water training in the Western Pacifi c
and passed through the Miyako Strait (sic) airspace, the Japanese SDF mobilized two F-15 fi ghters and conducted interference against the Chinese aircraft at close distance and shot IR fl ares,
endangering the safety of the Chinese aircraft and its crew.” On October 28 of the same year, the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of National Defense made a similar announcement. See
Part 2-6 (3) of this section.

10 When asked about the submarine’s transit at a regular press conference held by China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on January 16 2018, the spokesperson replied, “I do not have information about

At the press conference after the U.S.-China Summit
Meeting in September 2015, President Xi Jinping
stated, “China does not have any intention to pursue
militarization” in the South China Sea, but has been
advancing militarization.

[See] Chapter 3, Section 2-6 (4) “Situation of Activities in the South

[See]

China Sea”

As China’s infl uence in the international community
has risen politically, economically, and militarily, other
countries are closely following China’s moves. In order
to allay their concerns over China, it is becoming more
important for China to explain its military activities
according to the facts and improve the transparency of
its national defense policy and military capabilities. It
is strongly hoped that China will increase transparency
concerning its military affairs by such efforts as disclosing
specifi c and accurate information on its defense policies
and military capabilities.


It is believed that China continues to invest resources in
the improvement of its defense capabilities in tandem
with its economic development. Attention is to be paid
to how the slowdown in China’s economic growth affects
China’s national defense budget.
In addition, it must be noted that the amount of the
defense budget announced by China is considered to
be only a part of its actual military expenditures.[15] For
example, it is believed that the announced defense budget
does not include foreign equipment procurement costs
and research and development (R&D) expenses.

5 Military Posture


China’s military forces are composed of the PLA, the
People’s Armed Police Force (PAP),[16] and the militia.[17]
It is provided that these bodies be instructed and
commanded by the Central Military Commission (CMC).
The PLA is defi ned as a people’s force created and led by
the CCP, comprising the Army, the Navy, the Air Force,
and the Rocket Force, etc.

**(1) Military Reform**
China is currently carrying out reforms of the PLA which
are seen as the largest in the country’s history.
In November 2015, President Xi unveiled China’s
offi cial position on a specifi c direction of the military
reforms for the fi rst time, announcing that the military
reforms would be carried out by 2020, which would
include: establishment of “theaters” and a command
structure for joint operations as well as reduction of
troops by 300,000 personnel.
Military reforms have rapidly taken shape in recent
years. By the end of 2016 from what are called the “neck
up” reforms, namely the center of the military level


4 National Defense Budget


China announced that its national defense budget
for FY2018 was approximately 1,107 billion yuan.[12]
This initial budget amount represented a growth of
approximately 8.3% (approximately 84.4 billion yuan)[13]
compared to the initial budget amount for the previous
fi scal year. China’s announced national defense budget
has increased at a rapid pace every year since FY1989.[14]
The nominal size of China’s announced national defense
budget has grown approximately 51-fold in the 30 years
since FY1989 and approximately 2.7-fold in the 10 years
since FY2008. China positions the buildup of defense
capabilities as important a task as economic development.


11 See Section 2-6(4), Chapter 2-Section 6-4, Chapter 3-Section 3-3-6 and 3-3-7.

12 While converting national defense budgets of foreign countries into another currency simply by applying currency exchange rates does not necessarily refl ect an accurate value due to differences
in price level, China’s national defense budget for FY2018 is equivalent to approximately 17,711.2 billion yen when it is converted using a rate of 16 yen per yuan (FY2018 rate that the Japanese
Government uses for offi cial purposes).

13 Calculated for FY2018 from the basic expenditures of the central government for FY2017 and FY2018, since China released only the national defense budget amount as part of the basic expenditures
of the central government, which do not include local transfer expenditures among other expenses.

14 China’s announced national defense budget within central fi scal expenditures achieved double-digit growth on the initial-budget basis every year from FY1989 to FY2015 except in FY2010. For
FY2015, FY2016 and FY2018, the defense budget was announced within the basic expenditures of the central government. However, since the local transfer expenditure amount, etc. for FY2015
were released separately, this was added to calculate the national defense budget within central fi scal expenditures.

15 The U.S. DoD’s “Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China” (June 2017) estimates China’s military-related spending as having been at
least US$180 billion in FY2017.

16 According to the defense white paper “China’s National Defense in 2002,” “it is to maintain state security and social stability, and assist the PLA in wartime in defense operations.” Missions of the
PAP include security of party and government, border security, social projects, and fi refi ghting activities. In January 2018, the guidance and command system of the PAP was centralized under the
CMC. Under the CCP Party and State Institutional Reform Plan released later in March that year, it revealed that as a goal by the end of the year it would reorganize the PAP based on the principle of
“the military is the military, police are the police, and civil is civil.”

17 The militia engages in economic development in peacetime and other activities and has a duty to provide logistics support for combat operations in wartime. The defense white paper “China’s National
Defense in 2002” explains, “[u]nder the command of military organs, the militia in wartime helps the standing army in its military operations, conducts independent operations and provides combat
support and manpower replenishment for the standing army. In peacetime, it undertakes the tasks of performing combat readiness support, taking part in disaster relief efforts, and maintaining social

Note: This basically shows the defense budget within “the central government’s general public budget,” which had been named as “the central fiscal expenditures” prior to
FY 2014. Year-on-year growth rate compares the budget of a given year against the initial budget of the previous year. Note that FY2002 defense budget was
calculated based on the increased amount from the defense budget in the previous FY because only the amount and rate of growth were released. For FY 2016 and
FY2018, the amount of “the central government expenditures,” which are part of the central government’s general public budget, are used because only the central
government expenditures were announced.


up, are reported to be basically complete. Specifi cally,
they abolished the PLA’s seven Military Regions[18] and
created fi ve new theaters responsible for command of
operations, namely, the Eastern Theater, Southern Theater,
Western Theater, Northern Theater, and Central Theater.
In addition, they also formed the PLA Army (PLAA)
Headquarters,[19] Rocket Force (PLARF),[20] Strategic
Support Force (PLASSF),[21] and Joint Logistics Support
Force.[22] Moreover, the four general departments that were
the headquarters for the entire PLA were replaced by 15
functional sections under the CMC, including the Joint
Staff Department, Political Work Department, Logistic
Support Department, and Equipment Development
Department. Since 2017, military reforms have been
making steady progress with the start of what are called
full-scale “neck down” military reforms, namely the fi eld
level. For example, the expansion of the organization
of the Navy Marine Corps, whose mission include
amphibious landing operations, the unifi cation of
PAP leadership and command system under the CMC,
the reorganization from 18 Group Armies to 13, and
reform of military schools was confi rmed after 2017. In


March 2018, the Chinese Ministry of National Defense
announced that a reduction of 300,000 personnel had
been basically completed.
It is considered that these series of reforms are
designed to build military forces that can fi ght and win
wars by improving their joint operational capabilities
and strengthening the military’s readiness, including the
development of military capabilities and organizational


18 Shenyang Military Region, Beijing Military Region, Jinan Military Region, Nanjing Military Region, Guangzhou Military Region, Chengdu Military Region, and Lanzhou Military Region.

19 The PLA was considered a large organization of the Army, and therefore, a headquarters of the Army as a service did not exist. The ongoing reforms have given the Navy, Air Force, and Rocket Force
the same status as the Army.

20 The establishment of PLARF is seen as a de facto elevation of the Second Artillery Force.

21 PLASSF is identifi ed as a new force for maintaining national security. Reportedly it is in charge of cyber, outer space, and electronic warfare capabilities.

management from peacetime.[23] In addition, it has been
noted that the reorganization of the headquarters is a
means of tackling corruption at the center of the military
by strengthening the direct leadership of the CMC and
its Chairman and decentralizing the leading organs. The
total number of members of the CMC has continued to
be reduced in recent years[24] with seven newly elected
members at the 19th National Congress in October 2017,
including President Xi. Since it has been noted that many
people who have deep connections to President Xi were
appointed,[25] it is thought that President Xi’s command of
the CMC, and thus the PLA, is to be further strengthened.
While China is expected to continue these reforms,
there are views that dissatisfaction is growing within the
military because of the rapid military reforms.[26] Attention
is to be paid to the progress of the reforms as well as their
outcomes, including their effects on the security of Japan
and the rest of the region.

**(2) Nuclear and Missile Forces**
China has made independent efforts to develop nuclear
capabilities and ballistic missile forces since the mid1950’s, seemingly with a view to ensure deterrence,
supplementing its conventional forces, and maintain its
voice in the international community. It is regarded that
China’s nuclear strategy is to deter a nuclear attack on its
territory by maintaining a nuclear force structure able to
conduct retaliatory nuclear attacks on a small number of
targets such as cities in the adversary’s country, should
China be subject to nuclear attack.[27] The PLA Rocket
Force was newly established with equal status as the
Army, Navy, and Air Force as part of the ongoing military
reforms, suggesting that China will continue to attach
importance to its nuclear and ballistic missile forces.
China possesses various types and ranges of ballistic
missiles: ICBM; SLBM; IRBM/medium-range ballistic
missile (MRBM); and short-range ballistic missile


(SRBM). The update of China s ballistic missile forces
from a liquid propellant system to a solid propellant
system is improving their survivability and readiness.[28]
Moreover, it is believed that China is working to increase
performance by extending ranges, improving accuracy,
employing maneuverable warheads and multiple ones,
and by other means.
China’s main ICBM strategic nuclear asset had been
the fi xed-site liquid-propellant DF-5 missile.[29] However, it
has been suggested that China has in recent years deployed
the DF-31, which is a mobile-type ICBM with a solid
propellant system mounted onto a transporter-erectorlauncher (TEL), as well as the DF-31A, a model of the
DF-31 with extended range, and that China will increase
the number of DF-31A in particular. China is also viewed
as developing a new ICBM known as DF-41. With regard
to SLBM, it is considered that Jin-class nuclear-powered
ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) to carry the JL-2,
whose range is deemed to be approximately 8,000 km,
are currently operational. If the Jin-class SSBNs begin
nuclear deterrence patrols, it is believed that China’s
strategic nuclear capabilities will improve signifi cantly.[30]
Furthermore, it has been pointed out that China is also
developing an extended-range SLBM, also called JL-3,
and a new SSBN to carry it.
As for the IRBM/MRBM covering the Asia-Pacifi c
region including Japan, China has the mobile solidpropellant DF-21 and DF-26, which can be transported
and operated on a TEL. These are capable of carrying
both conventional and nuclear warheads. China possesses
ballistic missiles carrying conventional warheads
with high targeting accuracy based on the DF-21, and
deploys the DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile (ASBM)
carrying conventional warheads, which could be used to
attack ships at sea including aircraft carrier.[31] The DF26,[32] which has a range including Guam, is considered
a “second-generation ASBM” developed on the basis of


23 The report “China’s Incomplete Military Transformation” (February 2015) by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission and the RAND Corporation identifi es the weaknesses of the
PLA as the following: (1) organizational structure (e.g., party-military relations); (2) organizational culture (e.g., corruption); (3) force structure (size of the PLA, recruitment system, veteran’s benefi ts);
(4) command structure (e.g., military regions); and (5) human capital (e.g., decline in the quality and mindset of new soldiers stemming from the one-child policy, etc.).

24 There were 11 members in both the 17th (2007-2012) and 18th (2012-2017) CMC.

25 For example, it has been noted that Miao Hua, newly elected to the CMC, has close connections to President Xi having worked under him when Xi was part of the government of Fujian Province.

26 Veterans and others held demonstrations in front of the Chinese Ministry of National Defense in October 2016 and near the building that houses the CCP Central Commission for Discipline Inspection
in February 2017. Some view that these demonstrations and dissatisfaction with the military reforms are interrelated.

27 In February 2018, in response to the announcement of the Nuclear Posture Review by the United States, the Chinese Defense Ministry stated that “China adheres to the policy of no-fi rst-use of nuclear
weapons at any time and under any circumstance. Under no circumstances will China use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free zones.”
On the other hand, the U.S. DoD’s “Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China” (June 2017) states that there is some ambiguity over the
conditions under which China’s “no fi rst use” policy would or would not apply.

28 For differences between the liquid-propellant system and solid-propellant system, see Chapter 2, Section 2-1-3 (3).

29 The DF-5B is thought to carry multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs).

30 The U.S. DoD’s “Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China” (June 2017) indicates that “China continues to produce the JIN-class SSBN,
with four commissioned and others under construction” and that the SSBNs, which are equipped with JL-2 SLBMs, “are the country’s fi rst viable sea-based nuclear deterrent.”

31 DF-21D is called the “carrier killer” (Annual Report of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission [November 2015]).

the DF-21D, and it was announced in April 2018 that it
had “formally joined the order of battle.” In addition to
IRBM/MRBM, China possesses the DH-10 (CJ-10), a
cruise missile with a range of at least 1,500 km, as well
as the H-6, a bomber that is capable of carrying this cruise
missile. It is deemed that these missiles will complement
ballistic missile forces, covering the Asia-Pacifi c region
including Japan. China is likely operating these ASBMs
and long-range cruise missiles to strengthen its “A2/
AD” capabilities. Concerning SRBM, China possesses a
large number of solid-propellant DF-16, DF-15, and DF11, and they are believed to be deployed facing Taiwan.
It is believed that their ranges also cover a part of the
Southwestern Islands including the area surrounding the
Senkaku Islands, which are inherent territories of Japan.
Furthermore, in order to acquire strike capability that
will be able to penetrate layered missile defenses, China
is considered to be rapidly developing the hypersonic
vehicle WU-14, which is launched by a ballistic missile.[33]
Moreover, it has also been pointed out that progress is
being made on the development of the DF-17 missile
capable of carrying hypersonic weapons.[34]


These weapons are said to travel at ultra-high speed
and be diffi cult to intercept by a missile.
China announced that it conducted tests on midcourse
missile interception technology in January 2010, January
2013, July 2014 and February 2018.[35] Attention is to be
paid to China’s future trends in ballistic missile defense.

**(3) Ground Forces**
China has the third largest ground forces in the world,
next to India, with approximately 980 thousand personnel.
Since 1985, China has continuously sought to modernize
its military by curtailing the number of personnel
and streamlining organizations and systems through
reforms, including those currently under way, in order
to improve the capability while pursuing the downsize,
multifunctionality, and modularization of military units.
Specifi cally, it is believed to be improving mobility using
measures such as switching from the past regional-defense
model to a full mobile model, and working to motorize
and mechanize its infantry. China is also believed to be
strengthening its airborne troops (belonging to the Air
Force), amphibious forces,[36] special operations forces,
and helicopter units. China is undertaking efforts to build
a command system for improving its joint operational
capabilities and operational effi ciency, and is carrying
out reforms to improve its logistical support capabilities.
China has annually conducted mobile exercises that
cut across multiple regions such as Stride, Firepower,
and Sharp Sword. They are aiming at verifying and
improving the capabilities necessary to deploy army
troops to remote areas, such as long-distance mobility
capabilities of the army, and logistical support capabilities
that include mobilizing militias and public transportation.
Furthermore, the Army and Air Force reportedly took
part in the joint exercise, Southern Land 2017, and since
2014, have conducted combined military branch and
service exercises under Joint Action. These suggest that
China intends to improve its joint operational capabilities
as well.

[See] Fig. I-2-3-3 (Deployment and Strength of the People’s

Liberation Army)


**(4) Naval Forces**
The naval forces consist of three fl eets: North Sea Fleet;
East Sea Fleet; and South Sea Fleet. The Chinese Navy
has approximately 750 ships (including approximately 70
submarines), with a total displacement of approximately
1.79 million tons. China’s naval forces are rapidly
modernizing, and the Chinese Navy promotes the mass
production of its indigenous Yuan-class submarines with
superior quietness, as well as surface combatant ships with
improved air defense and anti-ship attack capabilities.
The Navy is also developing Renhai-class destroyers, the
largest in the Navy, indicated to be equipped with vertical
launch systems (VLSs) capable of launching the latest
YJ-18 anti-ship cruise missile.[37] It has also been noted
that its submarines are being developed to be capable

amphibious troops belonging to the Army in the Eastern Theater have been disclosed.

of carrying anti-surface cruise missiles. In addition, the
Navy is increasing the number of large landing ships
and supply ships. In September 2017, a supply ship
was commissioned with a mission to supply the aircraft
carrier group.
With regard to aircraft carriers, following the
commissioning of the fi rst aircraft carrier Liaoning in
September 2012, it appears that China is continuing to
train carrier-based aircraft pilots using domestic J-15
carrier-based fi ghters and conducting takeoff and landing
tests mainly in the Bohai and Yellow Seas.[38] In December
2016, the Liaoning participated in its fi rst comprehensive
live action, live fi re exercise in the Bohai Sea with other
vessels, including live fi ring by carrier-based fi ghters.
Furthermore, later in the same month, it was confi rmed
that the carrier advanced, together with multiple vessels,
to the Pacifi c Ocean and the South China Sea. It was
announced that the “Liaoning” advanced to the Pacifi c
Ocean and conducted opposing trainings including carrierbased fi ghters after its participation in a naval review in
the South China Sea from March to April 2018. These
activities are believed to indicate a further expansion of
the distant deployment capability of the Chinese Navy.
In April 2017, a launching ceremony was held for an
indigenous aircraft carrier with “a conventional powergenerating facility and a displacement of 50,000 tons”
and “a ski-jump takeoff style.” The carrier conducted
initial sea trials before its commissioning in May 2018.
Furthermore, China is reportedly building its second
indigenous aircraft carrier, and it is suggested that this
carrier is possibly equipped with an electromagnetic
catapult system.[39]

In view of these developments concerning the
naval forces, China appears to be steadily building up
capabilities for conducting operations in more distant
waters in addition to near sea defense.[40]

It is pointed out that, among the militia, whose status


is China s armed force other than the military the socalled maritime militia is playing the role of the advance
guard for supporting China’s maritime interests.[41] The
maritime militia is said to operate in the South China Sea,
etc.[42] and consist of fi shermen and residents of isolated
islands. However, the details of the maritime militia
have not been revealed. Given the China’s emphasis on
the necessity of “fully exerting the overall power of the
military, police and militia” on the seas,[43] attention is to
be paid to these asymmetrical forces, too.[44]

**(5) Air Forces**
The Chinese Navy and Air force have approximately
2,850 combat capable aircraft in total. As for the fourth
generation fi ghters, China has imported from Russia the
Su-27 fi ghter and the Su-30 fi ghter having anti-surface
and anti-ship attack capabilities. In November 2015,
China reportedly signed an agreement with a Russian
state-run military company to purchase 24 Su-35 fi ghters,
considered the newest fourth generation fi ghter, and has
received the delivery of total 14 fi ghters by December
2017. China is also developing its own domestic modern

<Description>

Carrier-based aircraft on the aircraft carrier Liaoning. It has many

features in common with the J-11 and Su-33 fi ghters.


38 In November 2013, the “Liaoning” advanced to the South China Sea for the fi rst time and conducted test navigation there. The carrier is said to have advanced into the South China Sea between June
and July 2017 and January 2018.

39 It is suggested that China is conducting research on the electromagnetic aircraft launch system in order to overcome the limitations of the ski-jump confi guration, namely, few weapons and little
fuel can be carried on the carrier-based fi ghter and fi xed-wing early warning aircraft cannot be operated. Additionally, in February 2018, major Chinese conglomerate China Shipbuilding Industry
Corporation announced for the fi rst time the construction of a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier in its development strategy outline on its website, but later deleted the text.

40 China’s defense white paper “China’s Military Strategy” (May 2015) identifi es “offshore waters defense and open seas protection” as a strategy for enhancing the military capabilities of the Navy.
According to the white paper, “the traditional mentality that land outweighs sea must be abandoned” and China will aim to “develop a modern maritime military force structure.” As implied by these
references, it is deemed that China attaches importance to its maritime strategy.

41 In April 2013, when President Xi Jinping visited the maritime militia of Hainan Province to give encouragement, he reportedly gave instructions to the maritime militia to collect information on distant
seas and actively conduct island construction activities and stated, “you are playing the role of the vanguard in protecting our maritime interests.”

42 For example, when Chinese naval and other vessels obstructed the U.S. Navy surveillance ship Impeccable on the high seas on the South China Sea in March 2009, maritime militia were said to be
aboard the fi shing boat that tried to take away a sonar from Impeccable. It is also pointed out that when the deep-water drilling rig Haiyang Shiyou 981 conducted prospective drilling to the south of
the Paracel Islands from May to July 2014, steel-hull fi shing boats maned by maritime militia also arrived as an escort fl eet.

43 In August 2016, when Defense Minister Chang Wanquan (at that time) made an observation tour of the maritime militia equipment in Zhejiang Province, he gave instructions on the necessity of “fully
exerting the overall power of the military, security and militia from the perspective of ensuring the requirement to ‘win the battle’.”

44 The status of China’s maritime militia under international law is said to be unclear. In November 2015, Admiral Scott H. Swift, Commander of the U.S. Pacifi c Fleet (at that time), emphasized on the
occasion of his meeting with then Admiral Wu Shengli, the former Commander of the PLA Navy, the importance of China’s forces including maritime enforcement agencies and maritime militia acting

fi ghters. China also has started the mass production of
the J-11B fi ghter, which is allegedly a copy of the Su-27
fi ghter, and the domestic J-10 fi ghter. China’s domestic
J-16 fi ghter, thought to be a copy of Russia’s Su-30
fi ghter, has started test fl ights at operational units. China’s
domestic J-15 carrier-based fi ghter thought to be modeled
on Russia’s Su-33 carrier-based fi ghter is carried on the
aircraft carrier Liaoning. Additionally, China is considered
to have started deploying the J-20 fi ghter, said to be a
next-generation fi ghter, to operational units, and is also
developing the J-31 fi ghter.[45]

China is also continuing the modernization of its
bombers said to have ground attack capabilities, and the

Chinese Air Force has increased the number of H-6K
bombers that are considered to be able to operate antisurface cruise missiles with nuclear warheads. The
Chinese Air Force is also developing a new strategic
bomber called the H-20.
China is also making continuous efforts to improve
capabilities which are essential for operations of modern
air forces by introducing the H-6U tanker and KJ-500

and KJ-2000 Airborne Early Warning and Control System.[46]
Furthermore, in July 2016, China started the deployment
of the indigenously developed Y-20 large cargo aircraft in
order to enhance its transportation capability. China is
also rapidly developing a variety of domestic unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAV),[47] including those capable of longduration fl ights at high altitude for reconnaissance and
other purposes (high-altitude long endurance [HALE])
and those capable of carrying missiles and other weapons
for attack purposes. Some of these are deployed and are
actively exported. In fact, it is suggested that the Chinese
Air Force has created an unmanned aerial vehicle unit
with an attack role. In addition to the frequent use of UAVs
for reconnaissance and other purposes in its surrounding
sea areas and airspace, domestically, it is noted that China
is working to improve “Swarm” technology[48] to operate a
large number of low-cost UAVs.
Judging from the modernization of the Air Force, it
is believed that China is not only improving its air defense
capabilities for its national territory, but also making
steady efforts to build up capabilities for air superiority
and anti-surface and anti-ship attacks in further distant
areas and for long-range transportation.[49]

**(6) Information operations capabilities[50]**
Information gathering and command and communication
in the military sector, which are vital for swift and
effi cient exercise of military strength, increasingly
rely on satellites and computer networks. As such,
China seems to recognize the importance of taking an
information mastery in wartime, when it must protect
its own information systems and networks while
neutralizing those of its adversaries at the same time.
China is considered to be emphasizing information
operational capabilities for these operations. In fact,
China stated that “outer space and cyber space have
become new commanding heights (capture point) in


strategic competition among all parties, and established
the Strategic Support Force (PLASSF) at the end of 2015
with a mission pointed out to be responsible for outer
space, cyberspace, and electronic warfare.
China is said to have developed its space program in
the shortest time in the world. In December 2016, China
published the white paper China’s Space Activities,
which emphasizes the peaceful use of outer space but
does not deny its use for military purposes.[51] In addition,
it has been pointed out that administrative organizations
and state-owned enterprises involved in the use of space
in China have close ties with the Chinese military,
and in fact, it is considered that China is planning to
improve its military capabilities in space.[52] Examples of
projects being advanced by China include the launch of
the positioning satellites called “BeiDou,” also known
as the Chinese version GPS, to develop global satellite
positioning system by 2020. Another example is an Earth
observation satellite that is suggested to possibly have
a role as a military reconnaissance satellite. Moreover,
China is thought to be developing weapons including
laser weapons, anti-satellite weapons and anti-satellites
satellites,[53] in order to restrict and interfere with the use of
space-based assets by adversaries in wartime. China has

46 The AG-600, which China is developing indigenously with the fi rst fl ight in January 2018, will be the largest amphibious aircraft in the world. Although it is claimed that it will be used for civilian
purposes such as natural resource research, the possibility of its conversion to military use has been pointed out. It has also been reported that China and Ukraine signed an agreement for
consultations concerning the large transport aircraft An-225 for export to and production in China.

47 UAVs being developed by China include the HALE UAV “Xianglong” (Soar Dragon), considered the “Chinese Global Hawk;” the BZK-005, a UAV that can be used for multiple purposes, such as
reconnaissance, communications relay, and signals intelligence; the GJ-1 “Wingloong” attack UAV; and the CH-4 “Caihong.”

48 State-owned enterprise China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC) announced in November 2017 that it demonstrated “Swarm” technology using 119 UAVs, breaking the U.S. record. It
is said that the use of “Swarm” technology with low-cost UAVs makes attacks on aircraft carriers and fi ghters possible.

49 The defense white paper “China’s Military Strategy” (May 2015) identifi es “building airspace capabilities and conducting offensive and defensive operations” as a strategy for enhancing the military
capabilities of the Air Force.

50 While the defi nition of information operations differs depending on the country, the defi nition of “actions using comprehensive electronic war, computer and network operations, psychological
operations, and other means to attack an enemy’s behavior or counter attack with resistance” has been used internally by the Chinese military.

51 “China’s Space Activities 2016” states the objective of space exploration as utilizing outer space for peaceful purposes to promote human civilization and social progress and provide benefi ts to all
humankind. At the same time, it also includes references to the demands of national security.

52 The Worldwide Threat Assessment (May 2017) by the U.S. Director of National Intelligence pointed out that China is continuing to improve its military and intelligence capabilities in space.

Commentary Cutting-edge technologies and Chinese military **COLUMN**

“Smart technologies” are steadily taking hold in Chinese society, such as facial recognition ticket gates and unmanned stores in
urban areas. This trends include the Chinese military. At the National Congress of the Communist Party of China held in October
2017, General Secretary Xi Jinping commented, “China intends to deter and win wars...by advancing new operational and logistics
capabilities, accelerating advances in intelligentization of the military, and enhancing joint operational and inter-theater operational
capabilities based on networked information systems.” As indicated in this comment, China is deploying cutting-edge technologies
in the military fi eld under the banners of “building information capabilities” and “intelligentization of the military.”
Drone “swarm” technology is an example of cutting-edge technology being developed in China that could be used for military
purposes. China Electronics Technology Group unveiled swarm technology with 119 units in June 2017, breaking the US record.
Various observers have cited the signifi cant military implications because of the possibility of artifi cial intelligence identifying changes
in enemy behavior and battlefi eld conditions and fl exibly carrying out operations with drones when swarm technology is combined with
artifi cial intelligence. China wants to strengthen manufacturing through cultivation of the semiconductor industry and other activities
and is making large-scale investments. However, since semiconductors help bolster the performance of military technologies, the
US decided in September 2017 to block acquisition of a US-based semiconductor manufacturer by a Chinese-affi liated manufacturer
due to concerns about outfl ow of military and security technologies.
China is promoting civil and military integration in the science and technology fi eld as a national strategy. Technology
developments in non-military areas hence might be applied for military purposes.
Technology advances are changing the nature of war and every country is focusing on developing and applying cuttingedge technologies. In particular, the US and China are engaged in fi erce competition in artifi cial intelligence and other new fi elds.
Technology developments in China should be closely monitored with an awareness of the possibility of military use.


**(7) Establishment of Joint Operational Posture**
In recent years, organizational reforms have been under
way to improve joint operations capability. The CMC
Joint Operations Command Center is believed to have
been established as part of this reform for the CCP to
carry out decisionmaking at the highest strategic level.
These actions have been continuing during the current
military reforms, and fi ve new theaters, joint operation
headquarters were established in February 2016. As for
assignment of senior military offi cers, in January 2017,
Vice-Admiral Yuan Yubai became the fi rst non-army
theater commander. As only army offi cers had been
appointed commanders of military regions or theater
of operations until then, it is assumed that progress is
being made towards joint operations from the viewpoint
of human resources. As General Secretary Xi Jinping
spoke about creating “strong and effective command
institutions in theaters for joint operations” and enhancing
joint operation capabilities at the 19th Party’s National
Congress in October 2017, China is thought to continue
to prioritize the development of joint operations systems
and will make further development.
In recent years, China has been conducting exercises
with the aim of developing joint operations systems,
such as the three services’ joint exercise (July 2017) in


the Eastern Theater, and the military parade with the
90th anniversary of the PLA consisting of theater-based
structure with a strong emphasis on the practical military.
These exercises are believed to be geared toward building
the forces of each military branch for joint operations
and implementing joint operations based on the theater
command.

6 Waters and Airspace Activities


**(1) General Situation**
Recently, China is believed to be aiming to build up
capabilities to conduct operations in more distant waters
and airspace. Accordingly, China has rapidly expanded its
waters and airspace activities using its sea and air powers
both in qualitative and quantitative ways. Specifi cally in
the sea and airspace areas surrounding Japan, Chinese
naval vessels, and navy and air force aircraft have been
observed conducting training and information gathering
activities, as well as naval vessels heading for distant
waters such as Indian Ocean. A large number of Chinese
government ships that belong to maritime law enforcement
agencies and their aircraft have been observed engaging
in monitoring activities for the protection of its
maritime rights and interests.[54] These activities include:


54 Concerning the PLA, there is a view that by turning exception into normality through uniform peacetime and wartime force deployment and exceeding traditional activity spaces, China intends to

intermittent intrusions into Japan s territorial waters by
Chinese government vessels; intrusions into Japan’s
airspace; and dangerous acts that could cause unintended
consequences, including a Chinese vessel’s direction
of a fi re-control radar at an MSDF destroyer, the fl ight
of Chinese military fi ghter jets abnormally close to an
SDF aircraft, and activities that could infringe upon
the freedom of overfl ight over the high seas, such as
the establishment of the “East China Sea Air Defense
Identifi cation Zone (ADIZ).” China is urged to act on the
basis of the principle of the rule of law.

[See] Chapter 3, Section3 (Maritime Trends)

[See]


**(2) Situation of Activities in Japan’s Surrounding**
**Waters and Airspace**

Chinese Navy vessels and Air Force and Navy aviation
have recently escalated their activities in the surrounding
sea areas and airspace of Japan. For instance, they are
conducting activities based on unilateral claim on the
Senkaku Islands, and are expanding their areas of
operations including the area surrounding the Senkakus.
These raise a great concern to Japan. The number of
scrambles by the ASDF against Chinese aircraft has kept
high, reaching a new high[55] in FY2016. The Chinese
military leadership has emphasized to continue to
improve the Chinese militery’s operational capabilities,


exhibiting the results of its recent 5-year activities such
as the “struggle” against the Senkaku Island, which is an
inherent territory of Japan, the establishment of the “East
China Sea Air Defense Identifi cation Zone (ADIZ),” and
its Navy and Air Force’s “regular patrols.” At the same
time, it appears that China continues to improve the
quality of its activities, and efforts can be seen to build
joint operation capabilities to develop a practical military.
a. Military Activities in the East China Sea (including the
areas around the Senkaku Islands)
Chinese naval vessels have been conducting operations in
the East China Sea continuously and actively.[56] Stating its
own position regarding the Senkaku Islands, China alleges
that patrols by Chinese naval vessels in the sea areas
under its jurisdiction are completely justifi able and lawful.
Chinese naval vessels have recently tended to expand the
sea area of their regular activities to the south, and are
continuously operating in the area near Japan’s Senkaku
Islands. In June 2016, a Jiangkai I-class frigate of the
Chinese Navy entered Japan’s contiguous zone off around
the Senkaku Islands. This was the fi rst time a Chinese Navy
combatant vessel entered Japan’s contiguous zone around
the Senkakus. Furthermore, in January 2018, a Shang-class
submarine and a Jiangkai II-class frigate passed into the
contiguous zone around the Senkaku Islands. This was the
fi rst time a submerged Chinese submarine was identifi ed
and announced as transiting through these contiguous
waters off the Senkakus.[57]
In recent years, Chinese Navy intelligence gathering
vessels (AGIs) have also been found conducting multiple

Ministry of Agriculture, “Maritime Safety Administration (Haixun)” of

the Ministry of Transport, and the maritime anti-smuggling force of
the General Administration of Customs, all of which were under the

State Council. In March 2013, China decided to reorganize the four

agencies, excluding “Maritime Safety Administration,” into the new
“State Oceanic Administration” and that the new organization would

carry out surveillance and other activities under the name of “China

Coast Guard” (Zhongguo Haijing) under the guidance of the Ministry of

Public Security. From 2018, these maritime security units were placed

under the command of the People’s Armed Police (PAP) and ultimately
the Central Military Commission as the People’s Armed Police Coast

Guard, but maintained the original name of China Coast Guard.


55 In FY2016, the number of times that ASDF aircraft scrambled against Chinese aircraft hit a record of 851 times.

56 For example, a China Military Online article (October 21, 2015) reported that in recent years, the average number of days in a year that all major combatants in the East Sea Fleet of the Chinese Navy
conducted operations exceeded 150 days.

activities. A Chinese Navy Dongdiao-class AGI repeatedly
navigated back and forth outside of the contiguous zone
south of the Senkaku Islands in November 2015. In June
2016, the same type of AGI sailed in Japan’s territorial
waters near Kuchinoerabu Island and Yakushima Island,
and then sailed within Japan’s contiguous zone north
of Kitadaito Island. Subsequently, the vessel repeatedly
conducted east-west passages outside the contiguous
zone south of the Senkaku Islands. This was the fi rst
navigation in Japanese territorial waters by a Chinese
Navy vessel in approximately 12 years.[58]

China’s air forces are also actively conducting
activities in the East China Sea on a routine basis. Their
activities include warning and surveillance, Combat
Air Patrols (CAP), and training. The area of the activities
of PLA aircraft has tended to expand eastward and
southward in recent years. As a result of this incremental
expansion, PLA aircraft have recently been confi rmed
conducting activities actively in airspace closer to the
main island of Okinawa and the rest of the Southwestern
Islands. The intent of the expanded activities of PLA
aircraft may be to operate the “East China Sea ADIZ.”[59]
In May and June 2014, incidents occurred where two
PLA Su-27 fi ghters came abnormally close to MSDF and

two PLA J-10 fi ghters reportedly intercepted a U.S. Air
Force EP-3 electronic reconnaissance aircraft.[60] And in
April 2018, an unmanned aerial vehicle presumed to be a
Chinese BZK-005 unmanned reconnaissance vehicle was
confi rmed to have fl own over the East China Sea.
Regarding Japan’s airspace over and around the
Senkaku Islands, territorial airspace intrusion by a fi xedwing aircraft of the State Oceanic Association (SOA)
in December 2012 marked the fi rst such instance by a
Chinese aircraft. Subsequently, fi xed-wing aircraft of the
SOA were frequently observed fl ying near the airspace
up through March 2014.[61] Recently, it has been confi rmed
that the scope of the activities of PLA aircraft near the
Senkaku Islands has tended to expand in the southward
direction. In June 2016, ASDF fi ghters scrambled against
PLA aircraft that fl ew southward closer to the Senkaku
Islands. The Chinese Ministry of National Defense

58 In November 2004, a Chinese nuclear submarine conducted “submerged passage through the territorial sea of another country” in Japanese territorial waters in violation of international law.

59 In November 2016, a spokesperson of the PLA Air Force stated that the PLA Air Force had been continuously conducting patrols of the “East China Sea ADIZ” for the past three years. See Chapter 3,

destroyer Samidare, which was patrolling the waters in the central area of the East China Sea. On April 12, 2012, a Y-12 aircraft believed to belong to the SOA fl ew as close as approximately 50 m

released an offi cial announcement stating that SDF
aircraft conducted provocations against PLA aircraft.[62]
However, SDF aircraft conduct scrambles in accordance
with international law and the SDF Law, and it is never
true that SDF aircraft conducted provocations against
PLA aircraft. Chinese announcements concerning
the Japanese response have been one-sided, and it is
extremely regrettable that the Chinese side is unilaterally
making explanations contrary to the fact, as doing so
undermines the Japan-China relationship.
b. Advancements into the Pacifi c Ocean
Chinese Navy combatant vessels continue to transit the
waters near Japan to advance into the Pacifi c Ocean and
return to base with high frequency.[63] The advancement
routes are multiplying. Chinese naval vessels have
transited the sea area between the main island of Okinawa
and Miyako Island, and have been found passing through
the Osumi Strait, sea area between Yonaguni Island
and Nakanokami Island near Iriomote Island, the sea
area between Amamioshima Island and Yokoatejima
Island, Tsugaru Strait, and Soya Strait. By diversifying
routes in this manner, China appears to be aiming to
enhance its deployment capabilities to the open ocean,
and considering remarks from high-ranking government
offi cials, it is thought that China is planning to make
deployments to the Pacifi c Ocean sailing through waters
near Japan regular activities.[64] Furthermore, considering
the nature of the activities it is conducting in distant
areas, China is presumably aiming to enhance operation
execution capabilities on the open ocean. In December

Chinese submarine sailing with the national fl ag of China hoisted (January 2018).


2016, the aircraft carrier Liaoning navigated the East
China Sea together with other vessels and passed the sea
area between the main island of Okinawa and Miyako
Island to advance to the Western Pacifi c for the fi rst time.
On that occasion, a surveillance helicopter took off from
a Jiangkai II-class frigate accompanying the carrier and
fl ew in airspace approximately 10 to 30 km southeast of
the territorial airspace over Miyako Island. In April 2018,
the aircraft carrier Liaoning and a number of vessels
participated in a naval review and training in the South
China Sea, and the Chinese Ministry of National Defense
announced that they passed through the Bashi Channel
and conducted confrontation exercises that included
carrier-based fi ghters. At that time, the MSDF conducting
warning and surveillance confi rmed aircraft presumed to
be carrier-based fi ghters taking off and landing, and it
was the fi rst time what are presumed to be carrier-based
fi ghters were confi rmed fl ying over the Pacifi c Ocean. The
activities are worthy of attention as an indicators of the
enhancement of the capabilities of China’s naval forces,
including aircraft carriers, and enhancement of its force
projection capabilities to distant areas. With a Chinese
Navy Shang-class submarine passing submerged from
the Pacifi c Ocean toward the East China Sea from Japan’s
contiguous zone northeast of Miyako Island in January
2018, it is thought that submarines also conducted some
activities in the western Pacifi c. In addition, in July 2017,
a Chinese Navy Dongdiao-class AGI sailed through
Japan’s territorial waters southwest of Matsumae-kojima
Island in Matsumae, Hokkaido, and subsequently sailed
eastward through Tsugaru Strait and advanced to the
Pacifi c Ocean.
Regarding the advancement of air forces into the
Pacifi c Ocean, the advancement of a Chinese Navy Y-8
early warning aircraft into the Pacifi c Ocean, passing
between the main island of Okinawa and Miyako
Island, was confi rmed for the fi rst time in July 2013.
The advancement of Air Force aircraft into the Pacifi c
was also confi rmed in 2015. In 2017, advances into the
Pacifi c Ocean via this airspace became more active,
especially after July, with fl ights totaling 18 passages
over the course of a year.[65] This is a signifi cant increase


62 Regarding the scramble by ASDF fi ghters against PLA aircraft that fl ew southward towards the Senkaku Islands on June 17, 2016, the Chinese Ministry of National Defense released the following
announcement: “Chinese fi ghter jets were approached by two Japanese F-15 fi ghter jets in high speed. They conducted provocations and used fi re-control radars against us. The PLA responded
decisively and took measures such as tactical maneuver. Consequently, the Japanese fi ghter jets fl ew away after fi ring infrared jamming shells.”

63 The number of times Chinese Navy combatant vessels have been active in the waters around the Southwestern Islands, Soya Strait and Tsugaru Strait since 2008 is: 3 times (2008), 2 times (2009),
4 times (2010), 5 times (2011), 13 times (2012), 21 times (2013), 14 times (2014), 12 times (2015), 15 times (2016), 12 times (2017), and 4 times (as of the end of May 2018).

64 In March 2017, when Japan announced the transit of Chinese naval vessels between the main island of Okinawa and Miyako Island, a Chinese Ministry of National Defense spokesperson said, “Japan
needs to get used to the fact that we will pass through many more times in the future.”

65 In 2017, Chinese military aircraft passed between the main island of Okinawa and Miyako Island once in March, 3 times in July, 5 times in August, 3 times in November, and 6 times in December for


-----

from the fi ve fl ights confi rmed in 2016.[66] The types of
aircraft passing through the airspace are also increasing
in variety year by year. The newest H-6K bombers and
Su-30 fi ghters were confi rmed by 2016 and the fi rst Y-8
EW aircraft in July 2016 were confi rmed by sight that at
least one of the H-6K bombers that fl ew in September
2016 carried objects in the form of missiles.[67] Flight
patterns have also been changing. In November 2016,
H-6K bombers and other aircraft were confi rmed to
have fl own from the south of the Sakishima Islands to
the East China Sea, passing between the main island of
Okinawa and Miyako Island, and made frequent fl ights
toward the Bashi Channel from the East China Sea via
between the main island of Okinawa and Miyako Island.
Upon the fl ight in December 2017 being confi rmed, a
spokesperson of the PLA Air Force stated that the aircraft
were “cruising around an island (Taiwan).” In August
2017, H-6K bombers advanced to airspace off the Kii
Peninsula after advancing to the Pacifi c Ocean via passage
between the main island of Okinawa and Miyako Island.
Through the conduct of frequent long-distance fl ights of
bombers and other aircraft, and the advanced fl ight paths
and composition of military units, China is thought to
be demonstrating its presence around Japan and so on,
and planning further enhancements to more practical
operational capabilities. With regard to SDF aircraft
scrambles against PLA aircraft advancing into the Pacifi c
Ocean in October and December 2016, the Chinese
Ministry of National Defense made false announcements
that SDF aircraft shot IR fl ares, endangering the safety
of the Chinese aircraft.[68] However, there is absolutely
no truth to these announcements; SDF aircraft conducted
scrambles in accordance with international law and the
SDF Law.
Additionally, activities considered to be planned
to improve the capability to carry out joint sea and air
operation execution capabilities, such as activities like air
to-ship attack drills when entering the Pacifi c Ocean, have
also been seen in recent years,[69] and continued attention
has to be paid for related trends.
c. Activities in the Sea of Japan
It is thought that the Chinese Navy has had vessels deployed
in the Sea of Japan for training and other occasions in


the past, and air units have also started activities in the
area recently. “Confrontation exercises” in the Sea of
Japan by Chinese Navy forces were announced for the
fi rst time in August 2016, during which time three aircraft
participated in the exercise, including two H-6 bombers
that passed through the Tsushima Strait into the Sea of
Japan. In January 2017, naval vessels and aircraft were
said to have carried out joint confrontation exercises in
the same area, in which eight aircraft, including six H-6
bombers passed through the Tsushima Strait to the Sea
of Japan.
The Chinese Air Force fl ew through the Tsushima
Strait for the fi rst time in December 2017 to advance to
the Sea of Japan. This passage included the simultaneous
transit of the latest H-6K bomber and Su-30 fi ghter, and
were the fi rst Chinese fi ghter aircraft to advance into the
Sea of Japan. In addition, the Y-9 intelligence gathering
aircraft that entered the Sea of Japan in February 2018
fl ew through the Western Channel (the strait between
Tsushima in Nagasaki Prefecture and the Korean
Peninsula) of the Tsushima Strait, and was the fi rst time
for a fl ight through the channel.[70] The activities of the
Chinese military in the Sea of Japan are considered to
continue to expand and be intensifi ed futher.[71]

**(3) Activities of Chinese Government Vessels Especially**
**Around the Senkaku Islands**

In December 2008, China Maritime Surveillance vessels
hovered and drifted inside Japan’s territorial waters
around the Senkaku Islands. These are not permitted
under international law. Since then, China Maritime
Surveillance and China Fisheries Law Enforcement
Command vessels have intensifi ed their activities in the
aforementioned territorial waters. Such activities have
been intensifi ed greatly after September 2012, when
the Japanese Government acquired property rights to
and ownership of three of the Senkaku Islands (Uotsuri
Island, Kitakojima Island, and Minamikojima Island).
Since October 2013, Chinese government vessels have
repeatedly intruded into these territorial waters, and the
form of the intrusions have become more reinforced.[72]

China is seen to be steadily strengthening an
operational posture intended to use Chinese government


66 Since 2013, air forces have passed between the main island of Okinawa and Miyako Island to advance to the Pacifi c Ocean 5 times (2013), 5 times (2014), 6 times (2015), and 5 times (2016).

67 The Annual Report of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (November 2015) states that the H-6K bomber’s ability to carry the DH-10 (CJ-10) land attack cruise missile, which
allows for more long-distance attacks, allows China to target as far as the second island chain including Guam.

68 See footnote 9 of this section.

69 For example, in December 2017, when H-6 bombers advanced into the western Pacifi c Ocean, naval vessels reportedly conducted anti-aircraft and anti-missile training in the same area. It is possible
that the training between the bombers and naval vessels was to improve joint anti-ship attack abilities.

70 The ROK Joint Chiefs of Staff announced that the Chinese military aircraft carried out “unusual reconnaissance activities” within South Korea’s ADIZ.

71 In December 2017, a PLA Air Force spokesperson stated after the Air Force entered the Sea of Japan for the fi rst time, “The Sea of Japan is not Japan’s sea.”

72 While with some exceptions, Chinese government vessels often intrude into Japan’s territorial waters two to three times a month from around 10 a.m. for about two hours. The number of vessels had

since August 2014. Since February 2015, three 3,000 t
or larger-class government vessels have been confi rmed
entering Japan’s territorial waters simultaneously
multiple times. China is also presumed to operate two of
the world’s largest 10,000 t-class patrol vessels.[73]
It appears that the operation capabilities of Chinese
government vessels in the sea areas around Japan are also
improving. In early August 2016, approximately 200-300
fi shing boats advanced to the contiguous zone off the
Senkaku Islands. At that time, a maximum of 15 Chinese
government vessels navigated the contiguous zone
simultaneously, and later for fi ve days a large number of
Chinese government vessels and fi shing boats repeatedly


intruded into territorial waters. It was confi rmed that
the government vessels that advanced into those waters
included many armed vessels.[74] This case appears to
indicate that China has the capability to simultaneously
inject a large number of government vessels including
armed vessels in the sea area around the Senkaku Islands.
These activities of Chinese government vessels in
the sea area around the Senkaku Islands are an attempt
to unilaterally change the status quo by force. Japan
fi nds China’s actions which escalate the situation totally
unacceptable.
In May 2017, it was confi rmed that an object that
appeared to be a small drone was fl ying above a Chinese
government vessel intruding into Japanese territorial
waters around the Senkaku Islands. This fl ight also
represents a unilateral escalation of the situation and
constitutes an invasion of territorial airspace.
Besides the waters around the Senkaku Islands,
Chinese government vessels were confi rmed to have
passed through the territorial waters of Japan around
Tsushima (Nagasaki Prefecture), Okinoshima Island


73 “China Coast Guard 2901.” and “China Coast Guard 3901” are also reportedly conducting test navigation. These government vessels allegedly carry a 76 mm cannon.

74 Since then, from mid-August, confi rmed cases have not included the intrusion of government vessels into territorial waters following Chinese fi shing boats. The frequency of intrusions into territorial

2017. The same vessels were also confi rmed to have
sailed in Japan’s territorial waters from Sata Cape to the
Kusagakiguntou Islands (both in Kagoshima Prefecture)
in August that year.
Retired Navy vessels are believed to have been
handed over to the China Coast Guard,[75] that was formally
launched in July 2013. It was reported that the Navy
and the China Coast Guard conducted a coordinated
drill. It appears that the Navy is supporting maritime
law enforcement agencies on both the operations and
equipment fronts. In July 2018, the Chinese Coast Guard
was incorporated into the People’s Armed Police (PAP)
under the leadership and command of the Central Military
Commission. The way of the military and the Coast
Guard cooperation in the future is worthy of attention.

forces in seas and airspace around Japan)

**(4) Situation of Activities in the South China Sea**
China has also been intensifying its activities in the
South China Sea, including waters around the Spratly
Islands and the Paracel Islands, over which territorial
disputes exist with neighbors, including some ASEAN
member states.
Since 2014, on seven features in the Spratly Islands,[76]
China has pressed ahead with large-scale and rapid land
reclamation works.[77] The Philippines-China arbitration
award issued in July 2016 denied the rights claimed
by China in the waters surrounded by the “nine-dash
line” including the “historic rights” as the basis of the
“nine-dash line” claimed by China, and determined the
illegality of China’s activities such as land reclamation.
However, China has made it clear that it would not comply
with the award and is currently continuing to develop
military facilities, such as batteries, and various kinds
of infrastructure that can be used for military purposes
including runways, ports, hangars, and radar facilities.
It can be said that China is advancing the militalization


of the features.[78] During the 19th National Congress in
October 2017, General Secretary Xi Jinping reported
the progress of the land reclamation work in the South
China Sea as one of the accomplishments of economic
development.
In Fiery Cross Reef, a large harbor capable of
receiving surface combatants is being constructed. In
January 2016, China declared completion of a 3,000
m-long runway which fi ghters and bombers can take off
from and land on, and aircraft test fl ights were conducted
willfully against the protests from countries in the area.[79]
In April 2016, a Navy patrol aircraft fl ying over the
South China Sea landed at Fiery Cross Reef to evacuate
emergency patients. At Subi and Mischief Reefs, in July
of the same year, China conducted aircraft test fi ghts
willfully for two straight days on a runway where large
aircraft can take off and land.[80] In January 2018, two Y-7
transport aircraft were reported over Mischief Reef, and
Y-8 special mission aircraft were confi rmed over Sui Reef
later in April that year. It has been noted that batteries
capable of being equipped with anti-aircraft guns, missile
shelters, underground facilities which are pointed out to
be ammunition storages, are being built on these features.
It has also been noted that the construction of this
infrastructure has been completed. Additionally, in April
2018, it was reported that anti-ship cruise missiles and
anti-surface cruise missiles were deployed in each feature
as part of a military training, and that radar jamming


75 It has been suggested that three Jiangwei I-class frigates belonging to the Chinese Navy were repaired to be handed over to the China Coast Guard. Similarly, it has been suggested that two Ludaclass destroyers will be handed over from the Chinese Navy to the China Coast Guard.

76 The seven features are: Johnson South Reef; Cuarteron Reef; Gaven Reefs; Hughes Reef; Fiery Cross Reef; Mischief Reef; and Subi Reef.

77 The U.S. DoD’s “Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China” (June 2017) notes that China added over 3,200 acres of land in the Spratly
Islands by late 2015 and completed the land reclamation.

78 The international community has repeatedly suggested that China is militarizing its activities in the South China Sea. For example, in October 2017, Harry B. Harris Jr., Commander, U.S. Pacifi c
Command stated, “We also want Beijing to do more to stop provocative actions in the East China Sea and the South China Sea, where the Chinese are building up combat power and positional
advantage in an attempt to assert de facto sovereignty over disputed maritime features … where they are fundamentally altering the physical and political landscape by creating and militarizing
man-made islands...where they are using its military and economic power to erode the rules-based international order.”

79 China is believed to have conducted three test fl ights at Fiery Cross Reef on January 2, 3, and 6 of 2016. In response, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Vietnam expressed strong
opposition on January 2, and the Philippines protested in writing on January 8.

systems were deployed on Mischief Reef. On the other
four features, it is pointed out that the construction of
facilities, such as harbors, helipads, and radars, is making
progress and that what appears to be large anti-aircraft
guns and close in weapon systems (CIWS) may have
already been deployed. If these features are used for
full-scale military purposes, it could signifi cantly change
the security environment in the Asia-Pacifi c region.
In the Paracel Islands, China has similarly carried out
land reclamations and promoted their use for military
purposes. China has extended the runway on Woody
Island since 2013. In October 2015 and October 2017,
China was reported to deploy J-11 and other fi ghters,
and in February 2016 and January 2017, the existence
of equipment likely to be surface-to-air missiles was
confi rmed. It has been noted that the takeoff and landing
training of the H-6K bombers in the South China Sea
announced by the Chinese Ministry of National Defense
in May 2018 was carried out on Woody Island. In recent
years, Chinese vessels have allegedly been conducting
what are likely to be survey activities in the Scarborough
Shoal, where a standoff took place between Chinese and
Philippine government ships in April 2012. It is pointed
out that new land reclamations in the shoal might be
started in the future,[81] and that if China conducts land
reclamations and installs radar facilities, runways, and
other infrastructure in the Scarborough Shoal, it could
possibly increase its ability to track the situation and
strategic capabilities in the surrounding sea area and
ultimately enhance its capabilities in all areas of the
South China Sea. Attention must continue to be paid to
the situation going forward.
The activities of the PLA in sea areas and airspace are
expanding as well. In March 2009 and December 2013,
Chinese naval vessels and other vessels approached and
intercepted a U.S. Navy vessel navigating in the South
China Sea. In May 2016, February 2017 and May 2017,
a PLA fi ghter allegedly fl ew close to U.S. Forces aircraft,


etc. In July and August 2016, after the Philippines-China
arbitration award was rendered, a PLA Air Force H-6K
bomber conducted “combat air patrol” in the airspace
in the periphery of the Scarborough Shoal. The Chinese
Ministry of National Defense announced that this patrol
would “become normal.”[82] In September of the same
year, the China-Russia joint exercise Joint Sea 2016
was conducted for the fi rst time in the South China Sea.
A fi eld training exercise by naval vessels including the
aircraft carrier “Liaoning” and a naval review ceremony,
regarded as the largest since the founding of China, was
conducted in the same area from the end of March until
April 2018. It is also reported that Chinese government
vessels fi red warning shots at fi shing boats of neighboring
countries, and that Chinese naval vessels are active in
some waters of the South China Sea at all times.[83] In this
manner, it appears that China seeks to expand its military
presence and enhance its military operation capabilities
in the South China Sea.[84]

Such activities by China unilaterally change the
status quo and further advance its efforts to create a
fait accompli. Japan is deeply concerned about these
activities, and the concern is shared with the international
community, including the United States.[85] In response to
the growing international concerns over the development
on the features, China asserts that a number of ASEAN
member states including the Philippines and Vietnam
are illegitimately occupying features of the Spratly
Islands and carrying out large-scale construction work
to build fi xed facilities such as airstrips.[86] However,
China’s development work on the features is of a scale
incomparable to the activities carried out by other
countries and is being conducted at a rapid pace.[87]

In any case, the issues over the South China Sea
are of concern to the entire international community
due to their direct implications for peace and stability of
the Asia-Pacifi c region. Countries concerned including
China are urged to refrain from unilateral actions that


81 In March 2016, with regard to China’s activities near the Scarborough Shoal, U.S. Chief of Naval Operation John Richardson stated, “I think we see some surface ship activity and those sorts of things,
survey type of activity, going on. That’s an area of concern...a next possible area of reclamation.”

82 There are reports that Chinese H-6 bombers fl ew along the “nine-dash line” in March 2015 and December 2016. Also, in December 2017, the Chinese Ministry of National Defense announced that
the Air Force aircraft carried out “fl ight training and other activities around the islands.”

83 In November 2017, Delfi n Lorenzana, Secretary of National Defense of the Philippines was reported in a local newspaper to have said that Chinese warships were constantly active near Sandy Cay in
the Spratly Islands. In addition, in April of 2018, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI) pointed out that the Chinese Navy and Coast
Guard Ships regularly visited the artifi cial islands in the Spratly Islands.

84 China is reportedly constructing a large-scale naval base that has underground tunnels for nuclear-powered submarines in the city of Sanya located in the southern tip of Hainan island. Experts point
out that the base is in a strategically important location that secures access to the South China Sea as well as the western Pacifi c, and that China is advancing construction work in order for the base
to play a role as a major hub of the South Sea Fleet, including for the deployment of aircraft carrier.

85 As a concern from the United States, for example, in May 2018, the Pentagon canceled the Chinese military’s invitation to Rim of the Pacifi c Exercise (RIMPAC) stating, “China’s continued militarization
of disputed features in the South China Sea only serves to raise tensions and destabilize the region.” As regards the concerns of the international community, for example, at the G7 Taormina Summit
held in May 2017, the Leaders’ Communique stated that “[w]e remain concerned about the situation in the East and South China Seas and strongly opposed to any unilateral actions that could
increase tensions.”

86 Remark by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China on April 29, 2015.

87 The U.S. DoD’s “The Asia-Pacifi c Maritime Security Strategy” (August 2015) states, “As of June 2015, [China] had reclaimed more than 2,900 acres of land” and “China has now reclaimed 17 times

**(5) The State of Activities in the Indian Ocean and**
**other seas**

The Chinese Navy is thought to be shifting its naval
forces towards “offshore waters defense and open seas
protection,” and is steadily increasing its capabilities to
conduct operations in more distant seas such as the Indian
Ocean in recent years. For example, since December
2008, Chinese Navy vessels sail in the Indian Ocean to
the coast of Somalia and the Gulf of Aden to take part in
international counter-piracy efforts. Activities of Chinese
Navy submarines are also beginning to be confi rmed
continuously in the Indian Ocean. In 2014, a Song-class
submarine reportedly called at a port in Colombo, Sri
Lanka, twice in the same year. This marked the fi rst time
that a Chinese submarine entered a port overseas. It is
reported that in May 2015 and May 2016, a Yuan-class
submarine and a Shang-class submarine respectively
called at a port in Karachi, Pakistan, and in January


and September of 2017, a Song-class submarine and
Yuan-class submarine called at a port in Kota Kinabalu,
Malaysia. Besides the Indian Ocean, in September 2015,
fi ve Chinese vessels reportedly sailed in the high seas in
the Bering Sea and sailed in U.S. territorial waters near the
Aleutian Islands.[88]

Additionally, China has been remarkably trying to
secure overseas bases such as harbors, which would help

in waters and airspace as far as possible from China
in order to defend its territory, territorial waters and
territorial airspace. Behind this objective is an increase in
effectiveness of long-range attacks due to recent progress
in science and technology.
The second is to develop military capabilities to deter
and prevent Taiwan’s independence. China maintains that
it will not allow any foreign intervention in solving the
Taiwan issue and realizing the unifi cation of China. To
ensure that they can prevent foreign intervention into
Taiwan, which is surrounded by the sea in all directions,
China needs to enhance its military operational
capabilities at sea and airspace.
The third is to weaken the control of other countries
and to strengthen the claim through various surveillance
activities and use of force, at sea and in airspace
surrounding the island to which China claims territorial
sovereignty.
The fourth is to acquire, maintain, and protect its
rights and interests. China is engaged in oil and gas
drilling as well as building facilities and surveying in the
East and South China Seas. It has been confi rmed that
in addition to the existing 4 platforms, China is building
12 new offshore platforms on the Chinese side of the
Japan-China median line of the East China Sea since
June 2013.[90] In late June 2016, the installment of an
anti-surface vessel radar and a surveillance camera was
confi rmed on one of the platforms. Attention is to be paid
to developments of the platforms by China, including the
purpose of such equipment. Japan has repeatedly lodged
protests against such unilateral development by China
and demanded the termination of such work.[91]

The fi fth is to defend its sea lanes of communications.

2017, China began construction of “security facilities”
for logistics support of the Chinese military in Djibouti,
a strategic point in East Africa facing the Gulf of Aden. In
recent years, China has been promoting[89] its “Belt and Road”
Initiative whose main purpose is establishing an economic
zone centered on the Eurasian continent, with the Chinese
military possibly taking on the role of the shield behind
the concept through the defense of sea lanes. Furthermore,
while it is thought that the concept includes a strategic
intention to expand its infl uence in the region, it is possible
that the construction of infrastructure based on the same
concept will further promote the activities of the PLA in the
Indian Ocean, Pacifi c ocean and elsewhere. For example,
by supporting the construction of port infrastructure in
Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and other Indian Ocean countries,
it is possible that China attempts to secure ports to call,
strengthen the defense of sea lanes, and further improve
the operation execution capabilities of the PLA Navy in
the Indian Ocean.

**(6) Objectives of Water and Airspace Activities**
Taking into consideration such factors as the development
of Chinese naval and air forces, activities in sea areas and
airspace, statements in defense white papers, China’s
geographical location and globalizing economy, the
water and airspace activities of the Chinese Navy, Air
Force and other organizations are considered to have the
following objectives.
The fi rst is to intercept operations by adversaries



**[KEY WORD]**

“Belt and Road” Initiative

A concept for an economic sphere proposed by President Xi Jinping.
The “Silk Road Economic Belt” (“One Belt”) and the “21st Century

Maritime Silk Road” (“One Road”) were announced in September

and October 2013, respectively. Since then, the two concepts are

collectively referred to as the “Belt and Road” Initiative.


89 China is collaborating on port development projects and other programs with local governments at such ports as Gwadar Port in Pakistan, Hambantota Port in Sri Lanka, and Chittagong Port in
Bangladesh.

90 On November 1, 2016, Foreign Minister Kishida (at that time) revealed that new gas fi eld drilling was taking place in that sea area and stated that “it is extremely regrettable that [China] is continuing
with acts towards unilateral development.”

91 With regard to resource development in the East China Sea, in September 2010, China unilaterally announced postponement of the negotiation to conclude an international agreement with Japan
for implementing the so-called “June 2008 Agreement.” While the negotiation has not been resumed yet, it is pointed out that China is highly likely carrying out gas production in the Kashi gas fi eld


-----

Meanwhile, in recent years, China has shown
interest in taking steps to avoid and prevent unexpected
situations at sea areas and airspace. For example, in April
2014, China, together with other countries such as Japan
and the United States, agreed to the Code for Unplanned
Encounters at Sea (CUES), which sets forth the standards
of behavior in the case that the naval vessels or aircraft of
the Western Pacifi c Naval Symposium (WPNS) member
states have unexpected encounters. Also, in May 2018,
Japan and China signed a formal agreement to start
implementation of the Maritime and Air Communication
Mechanism between the Defence Authorities of JapanChina to prevent accidental clashes between SDF and
PLA vessels and aircraft.[92]

7 International Military Activities


In recent years, the PLA has been emphasizing
nontraditional security missions such as peacekeeping,
humanitarian assistance and disaster rescue, and
counterpiracy. In order to carry out these missions, it has
actively dispatched its units overseas. It is believed that
in the background of the PLA’s stance on international
military activities is the expansion of China’s national
interests beyond its national borders, which in turn
increased its necessity to protect and promote its national
interests overseas, as well as China’s intent to raise its
stature by demonstrating its will to fulfi l its responsibilities
to the international community.
China vows to consistently support and actively
participate in UN PKOs. According to the Ministry
of National Defense of China, it has sent more than
35,000 military personnel to them.[93] According to the
United Nations, as of the end of May 2018, China has
a total of 2,514 troops engaged in UN peacekeeping
activities, including United Nations Multidimensional
Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA).
China has also contributed civilian police and
military observers, and has dramatically increased its
budget allocation for peacekeeping.[94] In addition, in
September 2017, China announced that it registered
approximately 8,000 troops in the UN Peacekeeping
Capability Readiness System (PCRS).
In this manner, China has actively made personnel


The seventh and tenth offshore platforms (East China Sea Gas Field)

In the background is the fact that its sea lanes, including
its oil transportation routes from the Middle East, are
essential for the globalizing Chinese economy. The areas
of its sea lanes which the Chinese Navy deems it should
defend depend on such factors as the international situation
at the time. However, given the recent strengthening of
the Chinese Navy and Air Force, it is believed that they
have been developing a capacity to defend areas past
China’s near seas to more distant seas.
Given these objectives and recent trends in China’s
water and airspace activities, it is believed that China
plans to further expand the sphere of its water and
airspace activities, and further intensify its operations
in waters surrounding Japan, including the East China
Sea and the Pacifi c Ocean, the South China Sea and the
airspaces over these sea areas, and the Indian Ocean.

and fi nancial contributions and has a growing presence in
UN PKO. It is deemed that underlying China’s proactive
attitude towards UN PKOs is China’s wish to strengthen
its relations with the regions where PKOs are conducted,
particularly with African nations, by way of these activities.
Moreover, China has been actively participating in
counter-piracy activities off the coast of Somalia and
in the Gulf of Aden as well as humanitarian assistance
and disaster relief activities. In view of the deteriorating
situation in Libya, China carried out an evacuation
operation of Chinese nationals from Libya from February
to March 2011 for the fi rst time. In this operation, China
dispatched a Navy vessel and Air Force transportation
aircraft to Libya. Moreover, From March to April 2015,
based on the worsening situation in Yemen, the Chinese
Navy’s counter-piracy forces docked at the ports of Aden,
Al Hudaydah, and elsewhere for the evacuation of Chinese
nationals and foreign nationals, including one Japanese
national, living in Yemen. In May 2017, when Sri Lanka
was hit by fl ooding and landslides, the Chinese Navy
carried out disaster relief activities, such as providing
material support and medical rescue activities, while it was
on a long-range cruise. China’s humanitarian assistance
and disaster relief activities have received international
praise. It has been pointed out, however, that through such
activities, China aims to build a pacifi st and humanitarian
image of its military forces and demonstrate, both
domestically and internationally, its intent to place priority
on military operations other than war. It is also suggested
that China hopes to test its ability to promptly project its
military power to distant locations.

8 Education and Training


In recent years, the PLA has conducted practical exercises
including large-scale ones such as joint exercises led
by theaters, joint exercises of the Army, Navy, and Air
Force, confrontation exercises, landing exercises, and
exercises that cut across military regions and theaters, as
well as night-time exercises and joint exercises with other
countries in order to strengthen its operational capabilities.
The goal of “being able to fi ght and winning battles” was
repeatedly mentioned in statements by President Xi. This
is construed as evidence that the military is promoting


implementation of more practical exercises. The new
military training regulations in effect since January 2018
referred to the implementation of joint and full-spectrum
operational capabilities based on network information
systems, in addition to the implementation of practical
training as a rule.
In the education spectrum, the PLA aims to
train soldiers who have the ability to implement joint
operations. In 2003, it launched a human resource strategy
project to develop human resources capable of directing
joint and informatized operations, and of building
informatized armed forces. It was reported in 2017 that
the PLA National Defense University began training
to develop human resources capable of directing joint
operations. On the other hand, in recent years, a variety of
issues have been raised in relation to benefi ts, including
remuneration, the personnel development system, and the
treatment of veterans.[95]

China outlined the promotion of “rule of law” at
the fourth plenary session of the 18th CCP Central
Committee in 2014, and is proceeding to develop various
related laws, and it is thought that the military will also
be required to implement the “rule of law.” One specifi c
action is Chairman of the CMC Xi Jinping’s comment at
the 90th anniversary commemorating the formation of the
PLA held in August 2017 that the “military be controlled
by law.” Additionally, in October of the same year, Miao
Hua, Director of the Political Work Department, and
Zhang Shengmin, Secretary of the Central Commission
for Discipline Inspection, were selected as members
of the 19th Central Military Committee, the supreme
decision-making body in the military.
China has been developing wartime mobilizations
systems in order to effectively utilize private resources
in case of emergencies, including wars. In 2010, China
enforced the National Defense Mobilization Law, which
is the basic law for wartime mobilization into effect. In
fact, while it appears that military weapons have recently
been transported by commandeered civilian vessels,[96]
such a development is thought to be in line with the
fusion of military and civilian personnel currently being
promoted, and it is possible that this will be actively
implemented going forward.

economy, and, in turn, civilian technologies are absorbed
for a buildup of national defense. As a result, specifi cally,
the technologies of the defense industry have contributed to
the development of civilian space exploration, the aviation
industry, and the shipbuilding industry.
In recent years, the “military-civil fusion” strategy,
which is said to have been upgraded to the national
strategy, is also being promoted in the fi eld of defense
technology.[97] Furthermore, China encourages and
supports international cooperation and competition
in dual-use industries. China is thus thought to have
interest in absorbing foreign technologies through dualuse industries. By proactively introducing advanced
technologies from overseas in this way, the modernization
of the PLA can be further advanced.[98]

and stable international environment is necessary for
maintaining sustainable economic development and
enhancing China’s overall national power. Based on such
recognition, in its relationships with other countries,
China proactively carries out military exchanges
including reciprocal visits by senior military offi cials and
joint military exercises. In recent years, China has been
engaged in dynamic military exchanges not only with
major powers such as the United States and Russia and
with its neighboring countries including Southeast Asian
countries, but also with countries in Africa and Latin
America. At the same time, the objectives of China’s
promotion of military exchanges are thought to include
alleviating other countries’ concerns regarding China by
strengthening its relations with these countries, creating
a favorable security environment for China, enhancing
China’s infl uence in the international community,
securing stable supplies of natural resources and energy,
and building foreign bases. China is believed to consider
military exchanges as a strategic means to safeguard
its national interests, and as such, to position military


9 National Defense Industry Sector


While China imports highly sophisticated military
equipment and parts that it cannot produce domestically
from other countries such as Russia, China is believed to
place emphasis on their indigenous production.
In recent years, reform in the Chinese defense
industry has progressed. Under the State Administration
of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense
(SASTIND) of the Ministry of Industry and Information
Technology, a department of the State Council, China has
formed 12 group corporations to develop and produce
nuclear weapons, missiles, rockets, aircraft, vessels, and
other conventional weapons. In doing so, China promotes,
in particular, two-way technological exchanges where
military technologies are utilized for developing the national

3 Relations with Other Countries


1 General Situation

China, particularly over maritime issues where its interests
confl ict with others’, continues to act in an assertive
manner based on its own assertions incompatible with
the existing international order, including attempting to
change the status quo by coercion. China remains poised
to fulfi ll its unilateral demands without compromise,
which has included making steady efforts to turn its
acts into faits accompli. It has advocated building a
“community of shared future for mankind” and, while
referring to promoting the building of a “New Model
of Major Country Relations” based on mutual respect,
equitable justice, cooperation, and “win-win,” it has been
noted[99] that China has tried to infl uence political decisions
in other countries through efforts such as putting pressure
on foreign educational institutions and winning over
politicians.[100] There have also been movements toward
creating their own international order, including the
construction of a China-led multilateral mechanism.[101]
On the other hand, China recognizes that a peaceful


97 As a specifi c example, in the fi eld of engine development and manufacturing for military and civilian aircraft, where the progress of proprietary development is limited, when a state-owned enterprise
specializing in engines was established in August 2017, President Xi Jinping emphasized the “close fusion of military and civil development.”

98 The U.S. DoD’s “Annual foreign Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China” (June 2017) states that China uses various means including cyber
theft in order to acquire foreign military and dual-use technology.

99 The General Secretary Xi, at a Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs in June 2018, underlined “thought on socialism with Chinese characteristic for a new era,” specifi cally, the
enforcement of the building of ”a community with a shared future for humanity,” the progress of “Belt and Road Initiative,” the development of global partnerships and leading the reform of global
governance systems.

100 In submitting an amendment to national security legislation to the Parliament of Australia in December 2017, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in his speech, “Media reports have
suggested that the Chinese Communist Party has been working to covertly interfere with our media, our universities and even the decisions of elected representatives right here in this building.”

101 China seeks to implement its own initiatives in the security realm; at the Conference on Interaction and Confi dence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA), China criticized military alliances and proposed
“the security of Asia by the people of Asia.” In the international fi nance domain as well, China plays a leading role in establishment of the New Development Bank (BRICS Development Bank) and the

exchanges as an element in China s overall diplomatic
strategy. Moreover, China has set forth the “Belt and
Road” Initiative as its foreign policy. In the international
fi nance domain, China plays a leading role in the
establishment of the New Development Bank (BRICS
Development Bank) and AIIB.

administration, which explicitly referred to the application
of Article 5 of the Treaty to the Senkaku Islands. The
same interpretation is reiterated in the “Annual Report to
Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving
the People’s Republic of China” published in June 2017
by the U.S. DoD. China has shown strong protest to
these views. With regard to the issues over the South
China Sea, the United States is concerned about such
dimensions as obstruction to the freedom of navigation
in sea lanes, restrictions on the activities of U.S. Forces,
and the worsening security situation in the entire region.
The United States has requested China to comply with
international norms, and has repeatedly criticized China’s
unilateral and assertive actions.[104] And the United States
also implements the Freedom of Navigation Operation[105]
in the South China Sea to counteract excessive claims to
maritime interests by other countries such as China. In
May 2018, DoD announced that they disinvited China to
RIMPAC (Rim of the Pacifi c Exercise) that is held every
year because of “China’s continued militarization of
islands in the South China Sea.”[106]

On the other hand, a hotline between the defense
departments of the two countries was set up in April
2008. In November 2014 and September 2015, the
United States and China announced that they agreed
on confi dence-building measures aimed at reducing the
risk of unintended encounters. China has also dispatched
observers to U.S. military exercises, and joint drills have
been conducted between the Chinese and U.S. navies on
mutual port visits. For example, the U.S. and Chinese
militaries have engaged in annual humanitarian and
disaster relief exercises since November 2013. After the
inauguration of the Trump administration, both countries
frequently mentioned the importance of bilateral military
exchanges, and several new dialogue frameworks were
launched. In April 2017, it was decided at the U.S.China Summit Meeting that the U.S.-China Diplomatic
and Security Dialogue would be established as part of
the new U.S.-China Comprehensive Dialogue, and
the fi rst meeting was held in Washington, D.C. in June
of the same year.[107] Also in 2017, the U.S.-China Joint
Staff Dialogue Mechanism was established and the
fi rst dialogue was held in November of the same year.
There were instances in the past, when the DoD notifi ed

3 Relations with the United States

There are various issues between the United States and
China, such as human rights in China, the Taiwan issue,
and trade issues. However, since a stable U.S.-China
relationship is essential for China to develop its economy,
it is believed that China will continue to aspire to maintain
stable relations with the United States. China is trying to
further develop relations with the United States through
mutual respect and “win-win” cooperation, respecting its
“core interests and major concerns.”[102]

The United States has made frequent statements on
the necessity of cooperation between the United States and
China on issues such as North Korea since the start of the
Trump administration. At the same time, it also called on
China to uphold international rules and norms on global
issues, including maritime security and international
trade. Furthermore, the United States regards China as
a “revisionist state” trying to shape the world along its
own authoritarian model, and has indicated it recognizes
that China is pursuing regional hegemony in the IndoPacifi c in the near future through the modernization of its
military and other efforts, and sees the re-emergence of a
long-term strategic competition from China’s revisionist
infl uence as a central issue in the prosperity and security
of the United States.[103] China has strongly opposed such
a perspective by the United States.
Regarding the Senkaku Islands, the United States
has reiterated that the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty applies
to the islands. This was confi rmed in a document between
the Japanese and U.S. leaders for the fi rst time in February
2017, in the joint statement from the fi rst Japan-U.S.
Summit Meeting since the inauguration of the Trump


102 Then Vice President Xi Jinping fi rst used “New Model of Major-Country Relations” in talks with then President Obama when during his visit to the United States in 2012. China explains that the concept
is based on: (1) no confl ict, no-confrontation; (2) mutual respect; and (3) win-win cooperation. However, when President Xi Jinping made no mention of it when he met with U.S. President Donald

Congress of the sale of weapons to Taiwan in October
2008 and January 2010, where China notifi ed the United
States to cancel the major military exchanges with them.
However, when notice was given in December 2015 and
July 2017, although China vigorously protested, it made
no remarks about canceling military exchanges. In 2017,
it made no mention of any measures against the United
States, and took a more restrained approach than in the
past. Although both China and the United States have
their differences, progress in military exchanges seems to
be relatively stable.


purchase of the S-400 surface-to-air missile system in
2014, with delivery of the missiles beginning in 2018. At
the same time, it is pointed out that Russia, which shares
a land border with China, has a policy of not supplying
sophisticated weapons to China that would cause a threat
to Russia and of differentiating the performance of the
weapons it exports. It is also suggested that Russia has
concerns about competing with China in arms exports.[110]
China and Ukraine have deep ties in the fi eld of arms
procurement, as indicated by China’s purchase of the
Ukrainian unfi nished Kuznetsov-class aircraft carrier
“Varyag,” which was the basis of the aircraft carrier
“Liaoning.” In this regard, attention will also be paid to
the relationship with Ukraine.[111]

Military exchanges between China and Russia take
place in such forms as routine mutual visits by senior
military offi cers and joint exercises. For example, the two
countries have held the large-scale joint military exercise
of navy “Joint Sea” every year[112] since 2012, and held
it in the Sea of Japan and, for the fi rst time, the Baltic
Sea and Sea of Okhotsk in 2017. From 2016, the two
countries started “Aerospace Security,” a joint missile
defense computer-simulated exercise. These exchanges
will likely enable China to not only deepen mutual
understanding and confi dence-building between their
militaries, but also learn about the operation methods
of Russian-made weapons and the operational doctrine
of the Russian Armed Forces. Furthermore, China holds
the joint counter-terrorism exercise “Peace Mission”
China and Russia or among the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization (SCO) member countries including China
and Russia.[113]

**(1) Relations with Southeast Asian Countries**
As for its relations with countries in Southeast Asia,
reciprocal top-level visits and other activities continue
to be carried out actively. In 2017, the heads of seven


4 Relations with Russia


Ever since the China-Soviet confrontation ended in
1989, China and Russia have placed importance on
their bilateral relationship. They have emphasized the
deepening of their “strategic partnership” since its
establishment in the mid-1990s. In 2001, the ChinaRussia Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly
Cooperation[108] was concluded. In 2004, the long-standing
issue of border demarcation between the two countries
came to a settlement. The two countries have a common
view on promoting the multipolarization of the world and
the establishment of a new international order, and have
further deepened their relations.
On the military front, since the 1990s, China has
purchased modern weapons from Russia, including
fi ghters, destroyers, and submarines. Russia is currently
the largest supplier of weapons to China.[109] Meanwhile,
their trade amounts are said to be declining in recent
years due to the advancement of indigenous weapon
production in China, however, it is suggested that
China has shown strong interest in continuing to import
Russia’s advanced equipment. For example, in November
2015, China reportedly signed an agreement to purchase
24 of the newest fourth generation Su-35 fi ghters, and
received 14 aircraft at the end of 2017. It was also
reported that an agreement was reached regarding the


108 Regarding the military fi eld, this treaty mentions military confi dence building or strengthening of mutual troop reductions in border areas, military cooperation such as military technical cooperation,
and holding discussions in the event that there is awareness of any threat to peace.

109 According to SIPRI, Russia accounts for 65% of China’s arms imports from 2013 to 2017.
110 It is suggested that China is plagiarizing, copying, and reverse-engineering military science technologies, including redesigning its own J-11B fi ghter based on the Russian-made Su-27 fi ghter. Feeling
strong discontent and casting doubts over China, it is suggested that Russia is cautious about supplying state-of-the-art equipment to China, such as the Su-35 fi ghter and the S-400 surface-to-air
missile. For example, Russia has allegedly requested that the agreement regarding the supply of Su-35 fi ghters requires the payment of a vast amount of compensation if China copies and produces
the fi ghter. It has also been noted that Russia may supply only the S-400 missiles with relatively short ranges.

111 China and Ukraine agreed on the export and joint production of four Zubr-class air-cushioned landing craft for China in 2009, of which two were delivered to China between 2013 and 2014. In 2011,
the two countries entered into a contract for the sale of three IL-78 aerial refueling tankers. It was reported in 2016 that they signed an agreement to hold consultations concerning the export and
production in China of the massive cargo aircraft An-225.

112 Joint Sea was held in April 2012, July 2013, May 2014, May and August 2015, and September 2016 in the Yellow Sea, the Sea of Japan off the coast of Vladivostok, northern East China Sea, the
Mediterranean Sea, the Peter the Great Gulf, and the South China Sea, respectively.

ASEAN member countries visited China on the occasion
of the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation
in May 2017 that included State Counsellor and Foreign
Minister Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar, President
Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, and President Joko
Widodo of Indonesia. President Xi Jinping also visited
Vietnam in November later that same year. China is also
actively involved in multilateral frameworks such as
ASEAN Plus One (China), ASEAN Plus Three (Japan,
China, the ROK) and the ASEAN Regional Forum
(ARF). In November 2017, Premier Li Keqiang attended
multilateral meetings in Philippines including the ASEAN
Plus One Summit. Furthermore, China has developed
bilateral relations through infrastructure development
support, etc. under the “Belt and Road” Initiative.
On the military front, China has made efforts toward
military confi dence building, such as goodwill visits of
Southeast Asian countries between April and October
2017 by the Chinese naval fl eet. In September 2017, a
submarine identifi ed to be a Yuan-class submarine also
visited Malaysia. These efforts can also be considered to
have the objective of securing bases for the activities of
the PLA Navy in the distant sea areas of the Indian Ocean.
Some ASEAN countries are likely to have
concerns[114] about China’s advance into the South China
Sea, but in 2017, any confl icts between China and these
countries over territorial rights in the South China Sea
have not surfaced. The Philippines instituted arbitral
proceedings[115] against China regarding their disputes
over the South China Sea, including Scarborough Shoal
and Second Thomas Shoal, in accordance with the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). In
July 2016, a fi nal arbitration was made where most of the
content of the allegations were accepted. However, since
China provides the Philippines with substantial economic
support, the Philippines is said to have refrained from
referring to the ruling.[116] The statement at the 31st ASEAN
Summit in November 2017, when the Philippines held
the chair, mentioned improved relations between China
and ASEAN, and did not express any concerns about the
situation in the South China Sea. This was the fi rst time


those concerns went unmentioned since the Chairman s
statement at the ASEAN summit in May 2014. At the
same time, in July 2017 and March 2018, the Vietnamese
government reportedly made foreign companies engaged
in oil drilling in the South China Sea with the permission
of the Vietnamese government cancel the drilling under
the pressure from China. This is regarded as an example
of China fl exing its muscles with its unilateral demands.
Moreover, it is reported that in December 2017 the then
candidate for commander of Indonesia’s army referred to
the “rise of China as a superpower” as one of the threats to
Indonesia’s security. These issues will be points to watch
for in future developments of China-ASEAN relations.

**(2) Relations with Central Asian Countries**
The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, located in the
western part of China, is situated next to Central Asia.
It shares borders with the three countries of Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. It has ethnic minorities
settled in the areas straddling borders, and there are
lively exchanges between the people of those countries.
Therefore, China is deeply concerned about the political
stability and security situations, such as terrorism by
Islamic extremists in Central Asian states. Such concerns
of China appear to be refl ected in China’s engagement
in SCO, which was established in June 2001. Moreover,
China is strongly interested in the abundant energy and
natural resources of Central Asia, with a view to diversify
its supply source and procurement methods of these
resources. China promotes cooperation in the energy fi eld
with Central Asian countries, such as the construction of
oil and natural gas pipelines between China and Central
Asian nations.


**(3) Relations with South Asian Countries**
China has traditionally maintained a particularly close
relationship with Pakistan, and mutual visits by their
leaders take place frequently. Their cooperation in
the military sector, including exporting weapons and
transferring military technology, is also considered to be
deepening. As the importance of sea lanes increases for

116 It had been pointed out that over the last several years China had been dispatching maritime law enforcement vessels appearing to belong to the Chinese Coast Guard around Scarborough
Shoal to interfere with Philippine fi shing boats approaching the Shoal. According to CSIS/AMTI, it was confi rmed that Philippine fi shing boats were operating around Scarborough Shoal after the
PhilippinesChina Summit Meeting in October 2016. In November of the same year, the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that “the matter of Philippine fi shermen

China, it is believed that the importance of Pakistan is
rising for China, partly because of the geopolitical features
of Pakistan which faces the Indian Ocean.[117] The ChinaPakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a development
plan for power facilities and transportation infrastructure
in the region stretching from the Port of Gwadar, where
China is assisting construction, to Kashgar in the Xinjiang
Uyghur Autonomous Region, is a fl agship project of
Belt and Load Initiative, and progress of the project is
expected to increase China’s infl uence in Pakistan.
China and India have undemarcated border areas,[118]
and in January 2018, an Indian newspaper reported an
incident of the Chinese military “crossing the border.”
Additionally, even in the Doklam Plateau where Bhutan
has close relations to China and India both of which
ownership of the highlands, a standoff occurred between
the two countries that lasted from June to August 2017. On
the other hand, China has recently striven to improve its
relationship with India, while also paying consideration
to maintaining balance with Pakistan.[119] And because
China identifi es the relationship with India as a strategic
partnership, the leaders of the two countries actively
conduct mutual visits. As a background to progress the
relations with India, there seems to be an emphasis on
economic growth of the two countries, and a response to
closer US-India relations.
In recent years, China has also been deepening its
relations with Sri Lanka. Initially after taking offi ce,
President Maithripala Sirisena, who had campaigned
to shift from a diplomacy oriented towards China to a
diplomacy oriented towards all countries and won the
election in January 2015, suspended the Colombo Port
City development projects fi nanced by China. However,
he subsequently announced their resumption in January
2016, and new development projects with China are
also showing progress. In July 2017, an agreement
was reached to lend interests to Chinese enterprises at
the Port of Hambantota, which is being constructed
with Chinese loans. It has also been noted that India,
traditionally closer to Sri Lanka, is concerned about
these developments. Additionally, China is deepening
its relations with Bangladesh, such as by developing the
harbor in Chittagong where a naval base is located and


exporting arms.[120]

With regard to military exchanges, China has
conducted a variety of joint exercises with Pakistan and
India since 2003, including joint naval search and rescue
exercises and counter-terrorism exercises.

**(4) Relations with EU Countries**
For China, the European Union (EU) countries are
now as an important partner as Japan and the United
States, especially in the economic fi eld. China, through
diplomatic opportunities, strongly requests EU countries
to lift their arms embargo against China which has been
imposed since the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989.[121]

Regarding information technology, avionics,
and AIP systems for submarines and other areas, EU
member countries possess more advanced technologies
than China or Russia which exports weapons to China.
Therefore, if the EU arms embargo on China were lifted,
the weapons and military technologies of EU countries
would transfer to China and would be utilized as a
bargaining chip to gain the edge in weapons transactions
with Russia. Although it was explicitly stated in the EU’s
strategy against China, which was adopted for the fi rst
time in 10 years in July 2016 that the position concerning
the arms embargo against China remained unchanged
and continuous attention will need to be paid to future
discussions within the EU.

Arms embargo against China

EU countries announced the suspension of arms sales to China as a

measure against the suppression of human rights in China during the

Tiananmen Square incident in 1989. However, the actual embargoed

items are ultimately left to the interpretation of the individual member

countries. China continues to seek the lifting of the arms embargo
against China, and there are movements towards reconsideration

within the EU.


117 China identifi es CPEC, a ground transport route that starts from the port of Gwadar in Pakistan and announced that China would invest US$46 billion in CPEC.
118 They include the Kashmir region and the state of Arunachal Pradesh.
119 At the meeting with Prime Minister Mohdi of India in September 2017, President Xi Jinping is reported to have stated that China and India have an opportunity to develop together and must adhere
to the basic judgment that they will not pose a threat to each other. Including these talks, President Xi has visited with Prime Minister Modi three times between September 2017 and June 2018.

120 According to SIPRI, Bangladesh accounts for 19% of China’s arms exports from 2013 to 2017, which is the second largest share.

Eastern and African nations in the economic realm,
including providing active assistance for their
infrastructure development and investment in their
resource and energy development, and has been further
expanding its infl uence in the region. In recent years, not
only interactions among state leaders and senior military
offi cials but also arms exports and exchanges between
military forces are actively conducted. Underlying these
movements could be China’s aim to ensure a stable
supply of energy and natural resources and to secure
overseas bases in the future. China has actively dispatched
personnel to UN PKOs in Africa. In December 2016, São
Tomé and Príncipe severed diplomatic relations with
Taiwan, followed by Burkina Faso in May 2018, while
re-establishing relations with China.
As regards China-Australia relations, a Chinese
company’s agreement with the Northern Territory
Government of Australia to lease Darwin Port raised
debates over security.[122] China has also been boosting its
relations with the Pacifi c islands. It has been developing
oil, natural gas, and cobalt mines in Papua New Guinea
and has signed an agreement on military cooperation
with the country. Though proactive and continuous
economic assistance has also been implemented in other
islands, Australia and other countries have also expressed
their concerns over China’s infrastructure projects.[123]
Furthermore, military exchanges are being promoted
with Fiji and Tonga.
China has striven to further deepen its relations with
Central and South American countries. Chinese senior
military offi cials have continuously visited countries,

such as Argentina and Brazil. Since 2015, China and the
Community of Latin American and Caribbean States
(CELAC) held the ministerial meeting. In June 2017,
Panama severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan,
followed by the Dominican Republic and previously stated
in May 2018, while establishing relations with China.

6 International Transfer of Weapons


The total of China's arms exports have surpassed the total
of imports since 2013. China has expanded provision
of weapons such as small arms, tanks, aircrafts, and
Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAVs) to developing
countries in Asia, Africa, and other areas. Specifi cally,
it is reported that the main recipients are Pakistan,
Bangladesh, and Myanmar, while weapons are also
being exported to African countries such as Algeria,
Nigeria, Sudan, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya, to Central
and South American countries including Venezuela,
and to Middle Eastern countries such as Iraq and Iran.
Some experts claim that China transfers weapons in
order to strengthen its strategic relationships with allies,
enhance its infl uence in the international community,
and secure energy and natural resources. China does not
participate in some of the frameworks of international
arms export control, and some observers point out that
there is proliferation of missile-related technology.[124]
Attention will be paid to whether China will increase
the transparency of international weapons transfer in
response to the concerns of the international community.


to solve issues of Taiwanese people’s interest and to
protect their due authority. Meanwhile, China is strongly
opposed to any foreign intervention in the unifi cation of
China as well as any move towards the independence of
Taiwan, and on this basis, China has repeatedly stated
that it has not renounced the use of force. “The AntiSecession Law,” enacted in March 2005, clearly lays out
the nonrenunciation of the use of force by China.[125]

Tsai Ing-wen (Democratic Progressive Party) won


1 Relations with China


China upholds the principle that Taiwan is a part of China,
and that the Taiwan issue is therefore a domestic issue.
The country maintains that the “one-China” principle is
the underlying premise and foundation for discussions
between China and Taiwan. China also claims that it
would never abandon its efforts for peaceful unifi cation,
and expresses that it would take up policies and measures


122 In November 2015, at the U.S.-Australia Summit Meeting in Manila, then U.S. President Obama reportedly told his counterpart that the United States would have liked a “heads up” about Australia’s
lease of Darwin Port to a Chinese company and to “Let us know next time.”

123 In January 2018, Australia’s Minister for International Development and the Pacifi c, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, was reported to have said that China’s investments in infrastructure in several Pacifi c
island nations were “basically white elephants” and that “we don’t know what the consequences are when [nations] have to pay back some of these Chinese loans.”

124 For example, China does not participate in the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), and some observers point to proliferation of Chinese missile-related technology to Pakistan and
other countries.

125 The law stipulates, “[in] the event that the ‘Taiwan independence’ secessionist forces should act under any name or by any means to cause the fact of Taiwan’s secession from China, or that major
incidents entailing Taiwan’s secession from China should occur, or that possibilities for a peaceful reunifi cation should be completely exhausted, the state shall employ non-peaceful means and other

a landslide victory over Zhu Lilun (Kuomintang) in
the presidential election in January 2016, and the Tsai
administration was inaugurated on May of the same year.
President Tsai has not outlined a clear stance regarding
the “1992 Consensus,” which positions China as the
political foundation of cross-Strait relations and which
exemplifi es the “One China” policy.[126] Furtermore,
President Tsai has upheld the “maintenance of dialogue
and communication of intent” and the “maintenance of
the promotion of the peaceful and stable development of
cross-Strait relations.”[127] Furthermore, President Tsai has
upheld the “maintenance of dialogue and communication
of intent” and the “maintenance of the promotion of the
peaceful and stable development of cross-Strait relations”
since taking offi ce, though comments, “we cannot return
to past tensions but also cannot succumb to pressure.”
Under the former administration of Ma Ying-jeou
(Kuomintang) that championed policies to maintain the
status quo over independence, the relationship between
Taiwan and China developed mainly in the economic
fi eld. While they managed to hold the fi rst summit
meeting[128] after the two countries split, following the
inauguration of the Tsai administration, China announced
that it has already suspended exchanges with Taiwan.[129]
Also, before and after the inauguration of President
Tsai, Taiwanese delegates were refused attendance
to or had their invitations ignored to meetings held by
international organizations.[130] In December 2016, São
Tomé and Príncipe severed diplomatic relations with
Taiwan, followed by Panama doing so in June 2017 and
the Dominican Republic and Burkina Faso in May 2018,
while they established relations with China.[131] Taiwan
is strongly protesting, citing these actions as “Chinese
acts that shrink the international space of Taiwan.” In
addition, China announced in January 2018 that it would
begin operation of new commercial fl ight routes near the
Taiwan Strait without prior consultation with Taiwan.[132]

Under these circumstances, China’s General


Secretary Xi Jinping stated at the 19th National Congress
in October 2017 that China was “ready to share the
development opportunities on the mainland with our
Taiwan compatriots,” while emphasizing that the “oneChina principle” is the political foundation of cross-Straits
relations. In February 2018, the Taiwan Affairs Offi ce
of the Chinese State Council announced 31 preferential
treatment measures including enrollment in schools and
support of employment from Taiwan. Even after China
announced its suspension of cross-Strait exchanges with
Taiwan, President Tsai called for dialogue with China.
At the reception marking the 30th anniversary of crossStrait exchanges, President Tsai, looking for a way to
open up relations between the two countries, stated that
“governance has entered a new stage” and “the present
presents an opportunity for change,” just as the 19th
National Congress had wrapped up. As President Xi
enters his second term, China’s attitude toward Taiwanese
policy and the future of cross-Strait relations will be
issues to watch.
Both countries have put forth their own assertions
regarding the Senkaku Islands, but Taiwan has a negative
attitude toward cooperation with China.[133]


126 On May 2016, President Tsai stated in her inaugural address: “In 1992, the two institutions representing each side across the Strait (SEF & ARATS), through communication and negotiations, arrived
at various joint acknowledgements and understandings. It was done in a spirit of mutual understanding and a political attitude of seeking common ground while setting aside differences. I respect
this historical fact.”

127 In her inauguration address on May 2016, President Tsai Ing-wen stated that she would “work to maintain current mechanisms concerning dialogue and communication of intent” and that “the two
sides should maintain the peaceful and stable development of cross-Strait relations on the existing political foundations.”

128 President Xi Jinping and then President of Taiwan, Ma Ying-jeou, held the fi rst summit after the China-Taiwan split in November 2015. Both sides reaffi rmed “One China” and agreed to establish a
cross-Strait hotline.

129 In June 2016, a Taiwan Affairs Offi ce of the Chinese State Council spokesperson announced that the exchange mechanism had already been suspended.
130 Recently, in May 2018, in addition to an invitation letter to the World Health Organization (WHO) annual meeting not being delivered, the director of Taiwan’s Ministry of Environmental Protection was
also said to have been refused entry to the 23rd annual Conference of the Parties to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 23). Taiwan claims that these are due
to Chinese demands and urgings. According to an announcement by Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, after a request from China, Nigeria forcibly closed Taiwan’s mission in July 2017, and the
governments of Ecuador, Bahrain, Papua New Guinea, Jordan and other countries asked Taiwan to remove “Republic of China” and “Taiwan” from the name of its missions and replace it with “Taipei.”

131 Taiwan currently has diplomatic relations with 18 countries.
132 In January 2015, Taiwan protested China’s announcement that it had set four new fl ight routes close to the Taiwan Strait saying that it was overcrowding the airspace. Following that, China and
Taiwan agreed to negotiate some of the fl ight routes, but when both parties were about to agree to preliminary talks on the pros and cons of operating the other routes in January 2018, China began
operation of the four routes without any prior consultation with Taiwan.

amount Taiwan spent.[137] In the Nation Defense Report
2017,” Taiwan acknowledged rapid growth in China’s
military capabilities along with significant advances
in military reforms, integrated operations, weapons
development, and overseas base construction and
pointed out “threat is growing to to Taiwan.” It also
mentions that Chinese military fighters and destroyers
routinely circle Taiwan and exhibit the country’s
military capabilities to Taiwan.[138]

While the PLA proceeds to enhance its missile,
naval, and air forces, the Taiwan’s military still struggles
to modernize its equipment. The U.S. DoD has notifi ed
Congress of possible arms sales to Taiwan based on the
Taiwan Relations Act.[139] Taiwan has announced that it
will continue to purchase advanced weapons.[140]

At the same time, Taiwan is also making progress in
developing its own equipment. In the fi rst Quadrennial
Defense Review (2017QDR) released under the Tsai
administration in March 2017, the review emphasized
progress, such as in the development of its defense
industry, particularly with the domestic production of
weapons and equipment. For example, in June 2016, the
Taiwan Navy announced a policy to switch over major

Ching-kuo fi ghter


2 Military Capabilities of Taiwan


Under President Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan has put forth a
national defense development plan of “resolute defense,
multiple deterrence” “Cultivate a Professional Military,”
and “Strengthen information, communications, and
electronic warfare capabilities.”[134] In December 2017,
Taiwan published its fi rst national defense report under the
Tsai administration. The report changed the existing force
concept from “victory on beach areas,” to “preservation
of warfi ghting capability, pursuing decisive victory in
the littoral area, and annihilating the enemy in the beach
area,” and made its fi rst mention of military cooperation
with the United States and insisted that their cooperation
made a progress both qualitatively and quantitatively.
Taiwan, for improving the expertise of its military
personnel and other purposes, aims to reduce the total
forces from 215,000 personnel at the end of 2014 to
170,000-190,000 by 2019, while transforming its armed
forces consisting of drafted personnel and volunteers into
all-volunteer forces.[135]

With regard to Taiwan’s military power, at present,
ground forces, including the Navy Marine Corps, have a
total of approximately 140,000 personnel. It is believed
that approximately 1.66 million reserve personnel of the
air, naval, and ground forces would be available in case of
war. Regarding naval capabilities, in addition to Kiddclass
destroyers which were imported from the United States,
Taiwan possesses relatively modern frigates and other
vessels. Regarding air capabilities, Taiwan possesses
F-16 A/B fi ghters,[136] Mirage 2000 fi ghters, Ching-kuo
fi ghters, and other assets.

3 Military Balance between China and Taiwan


While China has continued to increase its defense budget
by a signifi cant margin, Taiwan’s defense budget has
remained mostly unchanged for nearly 20 years. China’s
offi cial military budget in 2017 was roughly 15 times the

<Description>
Taiwan’s indigenous fi ghter. Designed and developed with technical

cooperation from the United States, it conducted its maiden fl ight in 1989.


134 According to the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) that the Ministry of Defense of Taiwan released on March 2017, “resolute defense…protect the homeland” and “achieving multi-domain
deterrence, comprehensive strategy” are listed in the military strategy. In July 2017, the Taiwanese Army added a new Information, Communications and Electronic Force Command to its general staff
aimed at improving cyber warfare capabilities.

135 Originally, the Ministry of Defense had aimed to transition to all-volunteer forces by the end of 2014, but in September 2013 announced that this would be postponed until the end of 2016. Later, in
October 2017, Minister of National Defense of Taiwan announced the policy that “a draft would not be conducted in 2018 and beyond.”

136 In November 2016, the Taiwan Air Force announced that it would begin the upgrade of its F-16A/B fi ghters to F-16V fi ghters with enhanced radar performance, etc. beginning on January 2017. It
states that the project will be completed by 2023.

137 This fi gure was obtained by comparing China’s announced FY2016 defense budget of approximately 1,044.397 billion yuan and Taiwan’s announced FY2015 defense budget of approximately
319.3 billion Taiwan dollars by converting them into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate for FY2015 released by the Central Bank of Taiwan (US$1 = 6.7588 yuan = 30.439 Taiwan dollars). China’s
actual defense budget is reportedly larger than the amount announced, and therefore, the actual difference in the defense budgets of China and Taiwan could be greater.

138 At a press conference in December 2017, President Tsai Ing-wen showed caution toward China, saying that Chinese military aircraft were becoming more active around Taiwan.
139 On June 29, 2017, (Eastern Standard Time in the United States), the Trump administration announced to Congress that it would sell approximately $1.4 billion (about ¥157 billion) in weapons,
including interceptor missiles, to Taiwan. This was the fi rst time for the Trump administration to sell weapons to Taiwan. However, it is reported that this does not include the F-35 and other highperformance weapons.

140 It is said that Taiwan has sought the sale of F-16C/D fi ghters and conventional submarines from the United States but they have not been achieved. “Asia-Pacifi c Rebalance 2025” published by CSIS

ships including submarines, to an indigenous shipbuilding program. In April 2018, it was reported that the
U.S. government granted permission to U.S. companies to
negotiate with Taiwan on the construction of submarines.
The military capabilities of China and Taiwan are
generally characterized as follows:
1) Regarding ground forces, while China possesses an
overwhelming number of troops, their capability of
landing and invading the island of Taiwan is limited
at this point in time.[141] However in recent years, China
has been steadily improving its landing and invasion
capabilities, such as building large landing ships.
2) Regarding naval and air forces, China, which
overwhelms Taiwan in terms of quantity, has also been
rapidly strengthening its naval and air forces in recent
years in terms of quality, where Taiwan had superiority
over China.[142]

3) Regarding missile attack capabilities, Taiwan has been
strengthening its ballistic missile defense, including
upgrading PAC-2 to PAC-3 and newly inducting PAC3. China possesses numerous short-range ballistic
missiles and other assets with ranges covering
Taiwan. Taiwan is deemed to have few effective
countermeasures.
Comparison of military capabilities should be made
based not only on the performance and quality of the
military capability and equipments, but also on various
factors such as the purpose and aspects of the assumed
military operations, the operational status, the skill
level of the personnel, and the logistics. Nevertheless,


the overall military balance between China and Taiwan
is shifting in favor of China, and the gap appears to be
growing year by year. Going forward, attention is to be
paid to trends such as the strengthening of Chinese and
Taiwanese forces, the sale of weapons to Taiwan by the
United States, and Taiwan’s development of its own main
military equipment.

**Section 4 Russia**


1 General Situation

President Vladimir Putin, who has been seeking the
revival of Russia as a strong and infl uential power,
successfully achieved reelection to his fourth term in
March 2018. In his inaugural address in May of that same
year, President Putin stated that Russia is a strong, active
and infl uential participant in international life, and that
the country’s security and defense capability are reliably
assured. He also stated that quality of life, wellbeing,
security and health were his main goals, and that Russia
has risen like a phoenix a number of times throughout
history and would achieve a breakthrough again.
At the annual presidential address to the Federal
Assembly of Russia in March of that same year, held
prior to the presidential election, President Putin said,
“Russia ranks among the world’s leading nations with a
powerful foreign economic and defense potential.” After
it became certain he would win reelection, President
Putin also called for the further strengthening of Russia’s
defense capabilities, while on the other hand, also making
remarks to the effect that Russia has no intention of
starting an arms race, and that Russia seeks constructive
relations with other countries.[1]


At that same presidential address, President Putin
talked about modernizing Russia’s military equipment,
including its strategic nuclear forces, and emphasized
that Russia would be developing new nuclear weapons
as a measure in response to the deployment of missile
defense systems by the United States domestically and
abroad. President Putin also expressed the recognition
that Russia’s military power helped maintain strategic
parity in the world, and made remarks to the effect that
Russia is prepared to negotiate toward construction of
a new system for international security and sustainable
development of civilization.
President Putin once remarked, “The collapse of
the Soviet Union was a major geopolitical disaster of
the 20th century,” and he has been working to unify and
strengthen the sphere of the former Soviet Union through
such as the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS),
the CIS Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO),
and the creation of the Eurasian Economic Union in 2015.
With regard to the situation in Ukraine, ever since
the efforts to implement ceasefi re agreements (Minsk
Agreements)[2] in the destabilized region of eastern Ukraine
following the illegal “annexation” of Crimea by Russia,
there have been no major developments in particular. The
West has alleged that Russia attempted to change the status
quo by force by engaging in “hybrid warfare,” and it is
increasing its sense of caution toward Russia.[3]

In addition, Russia has been conducting military
intervention in Syria since September 2015. Russia has
indicated that it has the ability to continually and swiftly
deploy military assets in remote areas while acquiring
bases in Syria. At the same time, it is thought that
Russia considers the intervention as an opportunity to
test and demonstrate its equipment. In December 2016,
Syrian government troops seized Aleppo, which is a


President Putin made this statement at a meeting that he invited other presidential candidates to after it seemed certain that he would win the election (March 2018).

The Minsk Protocol of September 2014 consists of the following items: (1) ensure the immediate bilateral cessation of the use of weapons; (2) ensure monitoring and verifi cation by the Organization
for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) of the regime of non-use of weapons; (3) enact the Law of Ukraine “With respect to the temporary status of local self-government in certain areas of
the Donetsk and the Lugansk regions” (Law on Special Status); (4) ensure monitoring on the Ukrainian-Russian state border and verifi cation by the OSCE, together with the creation of a security area
in the border regions of Ukraine and the Russian Federation; (5) immediately release all hostages and unlawfully detained persons; (6) prohibit the prosecution and punishment of persons in connection
with the events that took place in certain areas of Donetsk and Lugansk regions; (7) conduct an inclusive national dialogue; (8) adopt measures aimed at improving the humanitarian situation in
Donbas; (9) ensure the holding of early local elections in Donetsk and Lugansk regions; (10) remove unlawful military formations, military hardware, as well as militants and mercenaries from the
territory of Ukraine; (11) adopt a program for the economic revival of Donbass and the recovery of economic activity in the region; and (12) provide personal security guarantees for the participants
of the consultations.
Then, the Minsk Memorandum was signed in September 2014, and the package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement was signed on February 2015. These are collectively
called the Minsk Agreements.

Government and opposition forces led by Russia and
Turkey. Since January 2017, Russia has been increasing
its presence in the Middle East, including the hosting of
Syrian peace talks brokered by Russia, Turkey, and Iran,
while continuing the fi ght against ISIL and Hay'at Tahrir
al-Sham (HTS) (formerly known as Al-Nusra Front).
Furthermore, Russia concluded an agreement with the
Government of Syria for its continued use of bases in
Syria in the future. Focus of attention will be the extent to
which Russia will expand its infl uence in the Middle East
including Syria.

[See] Chapter 3, Section 1 (Trends in Regional Confl ict and

International Terrorism)

While Russia faces severe economic conditions,
forecasts indicate that following the recovery in oil
prices, a major export product, the country will maintain
positive economic growth in 2018.[4] Even after the
collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine is believed to have
cooperated on the maintenance of Russia’s ICBMs. It is
said that the suspension of Ukraine’s technical support
following the deterioration of the bilateral relation
could impair the operations of Russian equipment that
rely highly on Ukraine.

2 Security and Defense Policies


Under these circumstances, attention is being paid
on how President Putin, while maintaining his power
base, will deal with Russia’s diplomatic isolation from
Europe and the United States, and economic situation,
as well as promote economic structural reforms and
modernization of Russia’s military forces, and its effort
to expand international infl uence. Furthermore, although
attention was focused on the improvement of Russia-U.S.
relations immediately after the inauguration of the Trump
administration, stance toward Russia in the United States
remains severe and the outlook is unclear.

level of nuclear deterrent capability and the RAF.
The Russian Federation Military Doctrine, revised
in December 2014 as a document substantiating the
principles of the National Security Strategy in the military
sphere, states the existing view that while the probability
of an outbreak of a large-scale war is decreasing, military
risks to Russia are increasing, such as the movement of
NATO’s military infrastructure closer to Russia’s borders
including the expansion of NATO, and the establishment
and deployment of strategic MD systems. In addition, the
doctrine expresses growing alarm, defi ning the following
as new military risks: NATO’s military buildup; the
realization of the U.S. Global Strike concept; rise of global
extremism (terrorism); formation of governments in
neighboring countries that carry out policies threatening
Russia’s interests; and the incitement of ethnic, social,
and religious confrontations in Russia.
The doctrine continues to regard nuclear weapons as an
essential component for preventing the outbreak of nuclear
wars and wars that use conventional weapons. It states that

The National Security Strategy construes that Russia
has an increasingly greater role in a multipolarizing
world. The Strategy perceives increased activity of NATO
and expansion of its member states as threats to national
security, and expresses its vigilance against the U.S.
deployment of missile defense (MD) systems to Europe
and the Asia-Pacifi c region for undermining global and
regional stability.
In the defense domain, the Strategy commits to
giving continued priority to the role fulfi lled by Russia’s
military force, and to ensuring strategic deterrence and
preventing military confl ict by maintaining a suffi cient

In order to replenish funds for the government budget lost due to a fall in oil prices, Russia set aside a portion (the surplus) of governmental income received from oil production and exports.

According to the Russian Federal Treasury, the initial FY2018 defense budget increased by 4.1% from the initial budget of the previous fi scal year to 2.9530 trillion rubles, marking a 3.5% increase
compared to the budget spent in the previous fi scal year.

The command structure is reorganized from the four-tiered structure of military district–army–division–regiment, to a three-tiered structure of military district–operational command–brigade. Although
this was said to be completed in December 2009, in May 2013 the Guards Tamanskaya Motorized Rifl e Division and the Guards Kantemirovskaya Tank Division, which had been reorganized into
brigades under then Minister of Defence Anatoliy Serdyukov, were reactivated and participated in a victory parade. Furthermore, in the January 25, 2016 edition of Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star), a
newspaper of the military, Gen. Oleg Salyukov, Ground Forces Commander, stated that four divisions were scheduled to be established in 2016 based on the existing brigades.

It was decided that the total military force would be one million personnel as of 2016 by an executive order of December 2008 (the strength was approximately 1.13 million as of 2008). According
to TASS, an Executive Order issued by the President of Russia in July 2016 calls for the number of military personnel to be kept at one million.

forces, in order to make the combat readiness of the
permanent readiness units effective, Russia promotes
the introduction of a contract service system (for
noncommissioned offi cers and soldiers) which selects
personnel who would serve under contracts from the
conscripted military personnel. In 2015, the number of
contract servicemen exceeded the number of conscripted
personnel for the fi rst time, and in the future the percentage

of contract servicemen is set to increase further.[10]
In the context of the gradual increase in diffi culties
in securing the defense budget due to the recent severe
economic situation, attention will be paid to the trends
related to Russian efforts to improve the capacity of
conventional forces and maintain the strategic deterrence
capability provided by nuclear weapons.

commissioned. There are plans to deploy four such vessels
each to the Northern Fleet and Pacifi c Fleet in the future.
In October 2017, fi ring training took place using an
ICBM “Topol” from Plesetsk Cosmodrome as well as
SLBMs from a SSBN in the Okhotsk Sea and a SSBN
from the Barents Sea. Cruise missile fi ring training also
took place using long-range bombers. President Putin,
at the Expanded Meeting of the Defense Ministry Board
held in December 2017, noted that the share of modern
weapons in Russia’s nuclear triad had reached nearly 80%,
and stated that Russia would increase that percentage to
90% by 2021. He also stated that Russia could overcome
both existing and future missile defense systems.


Russia’s military forces are comprised of forces such as
the RAF, the Border Guard Service of the Federal Security
Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), and the Federal
National Guard Service of the Russian Federation. The
RAF consists of three services and two independent
forces: Land Forces; Navy; Aerospace Forces; Strategic
Missile Forces; and Airborne Forces.

1 Nuclear Forces


Russia emphasizes its nuclear forces to secure its global
position, to strike a balance with the nuclear forces
of the United States and to supplement its inferiority
in conventional forces. It is thus believed that Russia
is making efforts to maintain readiness of its nuclear
forces unit.
Russia still possesses ICBMs, SLBMs, and long
range bombers (Tu-95 Bears and Tu-160 Blackjacks)
comparable to the United States in scale.
Russia is obligated to reduce strategic nuclear arms
pursuant to the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
concluded with the United States.[11] Russia is working
on accelerating the development and introduction of new
weapons under the policy to prioritize the modernization
of nuclear forces based on its GPV.
In March 2011, Russia started the deployment of
RS24, which is considered a multi-warhead version of the
“Topol-M” ICBM.[12] Since December 2012, three Boreyclass Nuclear-Powered Ballistic Missile Submarine (SSBN)
vessels, which carry the new-type SLBM “Bulava,” were

carrying ballistic missiles, the fi rst ship being commissioned in 2012.

It can carry 16 SLBMs. It has been deployed with the Pacifi c Fleet

since 2015.


10 Reasons behind the promotion of the contract service system may include a decrease in the population suitable for military service and the shortening of the conscription period (since January 2008,
the conscription period has been shortened to 12 months). At the Expanded Meeting of the Defence Ministry Board in December 2016, Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu stated that personnel
strength adequacy was around 93% and contracted soldiers totaled approximately 384,000.

11 In April 2010, Russia and the United States signed the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty to replace the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty I (START I), and the treaty came into force in February
2011. Each side is obligated to reduce deployed strategic warheads to 1,550 and their deployed delivery platforms to 700 within seven years after the entry into force of the treaty. The United States
announced that as of February 2018 Russia had 1,350 deployed strategic warheads and 562 deployed delivery platforms, while Russia announced that as of February 2018, it had 1,444 deployed
strategic warheads and 527 deployed delivery platforms.

12 In addition, it is believed that Russia is developing a new heavy ICBM “Sarmat”(RS-28) that can destroy robust ICBM launch sites and be equipped with many warheads, a light-weight mobile solid-fuel

other hand, Russia has criticized the U.S. as well, saying
that it is in effect in violation of the INF treaty, calling the
Aegis Ashore system a potential platform for the launch
of Tomahawk missiles. Different assertions about the
treaty still exist between Russia and the U.S.


2 Conventional Forces and Other Issues


Russia is considered to be developing and procuring
conventional forces in accordance with its GPV. Close
attention will need to be paid to Russia’s development,
procurement, and deployment of new equipment, such as
the “PAK FA” (Su-57)[13] currently under development as
the so-called “fi fth generation fi ghter” and the T-14 Armata



**[KEY WORD]**

Fifth generation fi ghter

While there are no clear standards for demarcating fi ghter

generations, it is pointed out that a fi fth generation fi ghter has

more advanced capabilities than those of previous generations by

combining the latest technologies, such as various types of electronic

equipment and stealth.


Commentary Modernization of Russia’s nuclear forces **COLUMN**

The Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation (announced in December 2014) asserts that Russia retains the right to strike with
nuclear weapons not only if nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction are used but also in the case of an invasion involving
conventional weapons that threatens the country’s survival. In this way, Russia is placing priority on modernization of nuclear capabilities
from the standpoint of a nuclear equilibrium with the US and supplementation of weaknesses in conventional forces.
Strategic nuclear force initiatives are promoting multiple warheads, increased nuclear output, and other improvements, including
the new Yars intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) for mobile and silo use and deployment of new Borei-class nuclear-powered
ballistic missile submarines equipped with new Bulava submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM). In non-strategic (tactical)
nuclear weapons, Russia is moving forward with deployments of the new Iskander short-range ballistic missile (land-to-land) that
can carry conventional or nuclear warheads and the Kalibr cruise (ship-to-land) missile.
Additionally, Russia has stated that it is pursuing nuclear capabilities to destroy the missile defense system being installed by
the US domestically and abroad on the basis that it undermines the balance of nuclear forces with the United States. At the State of
the Union Address given in March 2018, President Putin introduced a variety of new weapons, including the Sarmat large silo-type
ICBM, a nuclear-powered cruise missile, a nuclear-powered unmanned submarine weapon, the Kinzhal hypersonic missile for fi ghter
planes, and the Avangard strategic missile with winged aircraft in the warhead.
Japan needs to continue to closely monitor activities by the Russian military, including modernization of nuclear forces and
developments, including in light of Russia’s deployments of nuclear submarines armed with ballistic missiles and strategic bombers
in the Far East region.

tank,[14] in addition to the introduction of the Su-35 fi ghter
and the surface-to-surface missile system “Iskander.”
Along with carrying out a range of exercises,[15] since
February 2013, the RAF have been conducting surprise
inspections designed to validate the combat readiness
of the military districts, etc. for the fi rst time since
the collapse of the Soviet Union.[16] These inspections
are contributing to the improvement of long-distance
mobilization capability of the RAF.[17] Furthermore,
outside of Russia, the RAF have been deploying
vessels mainly formed of the Black Sea Fleet to the
Mediterranean Sea.[18] In addition, from October 2017 to
January of the following year, Steregushchiy-class frigates
belonging to the Baltic Fleet navigated the long distance
from the North Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean
Sea and Indian Ocean. A plan is underway to construct
or rebuild 10 airfi elds in the Arctic, and in August and
October 2017, a fl otilla mainly comprising Northern
Fleet Udaloy-class destroyers took part in a landing drill
while navigating the long distance from Severomorsk on
the Kola peninsula to the Novosibirsk islands.[19] The RAF

Su-35 fi ghter


has been intensifying its activities in the Arctic, which
include not only such deployment and exercises of naval
vessels and resumption of military facility operation, but
also strategic nuclear deterrence patrols by SSBN and
patrol fl ights by long-range bombers.
In addition, in April 2017, Russian Tu-95 longrange bombers fl ew as far as the coast off Alaska, and
in December that year, Tu-95 bombers also visited Biak
Airport in Indonesia. In addition, in January 2018, Tu160 long-range bombers fl ew to the Barents Sea, the
Norwegian Sea, and the North Sea.
The RAF has thus intensifi ed activities not only in
the Asia-Pacifi c, but also in the Arctic, Europe, areas
near the U.S., and the Middle East. In particular, Russia’s
vessels and aircraft tend to expand their area of activity.[20]
As for the future of RAF, there are uncertain
elements which may be infl uenced by Russia’s future
economic and social development and trends in Russia’s
diplomatic relations with European and other countries;
therefore, it is necessary to keep our attention on future
developments.

and wheeled infantry fi ghting vehicles, armored personnel carriers, self-propelled howitzers, and so on. A contract for 100 tanks was concluded in 2016, with the delivery of the tanks scheduled to
occur in 2020.

15 As it proceeds with its military reform, Russia has conducted large-scale exercises for verifi cation and other purposes in recent years. Among these, Zapad 2017 was held in September 2017 as a
command and staff exercise held in a round-robin format involving all military districts. Taking part in this exercise were around 12,700 troops, 70 aircraft and helicopters, and 250 tanks. The purpose
of this exercise is believed to be enhancing the mutual operating capabilities of each joint strategic command and the coordination of advanced command and control systems. (Exercises from the
previous four years included: Vostok 2014 [East Military District], Tsentr 2015 [Central Military District], Kavkaz 2016 [South Military District], and Zapad 2016 [West Military District].)

16 Surprise inspections were conducted at the Central and Southern Military Districts in February 2013, Southern Military District in March 2013, Western Military District in May 2013, Eastern and
Central Military Districts in July 2013, strategic nuclear units in October 2013, and Western and Central Military Districts from February to March 2014. In September 2014, a surprise inspection of
the Eastern Military District was conducted, which transitioned to the Vostok 2014 large-scale exercise.

17 At the Expanded Meeting of the Defence Ministry Board in December 2015, Minister of Defence Shoigu stated that the surprise inspections held fi ve times a year on average would enable the
commanders of every military district and military service as well as staff to mobilize long distances and execute tasks in unknown regions.

18 Russia’s naval fl eet in the Mediterranean which is said to have completed its formation on June 1, 2013, is considered a permanent operational force.

19 Among the military installations being developed in the Arctic, it is believed that the bases under construction on Alexandra Island in the Franz Joseph Land and Kotelny Island in the Novosibirsk Islands
will house 150 and 250 personnel each and have enough supplies to continue operations without assistance for a period of 18 months. In addition, the Northern Fleet has conducted long distance
navigation to the Novosibirsk Islands every year since 2012.

20 It is deemed that the RAF intends to maintain and enhance their combat readiness, as well as use diversionary approach towards the West and other countries in connection with the situation in

Sea of Okhotsk, and approximately 30 Tu-95 long-range
bombers are deployed in Ukrainka. Russia is prioritizing
the reinforcement of its maritime strategic deterrence
posture which had been greatly scaled-down compared
to the former Soviet Union, and as part of these efforts, it
plans on deploying four Borey-class SSBNs to the Pacifi c
Fleet by 2020.

**(2) Ground Forces**
As part of its military reforms, Russia is thought to be
reorganizing the command structure from a divisionbased to a brigade-based one, while also shifting all
of its combat forces into permanent readiness units.
The Eastern Military District now consists of eleven
brigades and one division with approximately 80,000
personnel in total as well as a marine brigade equipped
with amphibious operations capability. The Eastern
Military District has introduced new equipment, such as
the “Iskander” surface-to-surface missile system, “Bal”
and “Bastion” surface-to-ship missiles, and the “S-400”
surface-to-air missile system.


1 General Situation

Russia newly established the Eastern Military District
and the Eastern Joint Strategic Command in 2010.
Land Forces, the Pacifi c Fleet, and the Air Force and
Air Defense Units have been placed under the Military
District Commander, who conducts unifi ed operation of
these services.
The current presence of the RAF in the Far East region
is signifi cantly smaller than it was at its peak. However,
a considerable scale of military forces, including nuclear
forces, still remains in the region. Russian armed forces
in the vicinity of Japan are generally increasing activity,
including the trend related to deployment of new units
and military facility development.
Given that the RAF set their basis of operation on
maintaining the combat readiness of their strategic nuclear
units and dealing with confl icts through the intertheater
mobility of its round-the-clock readiness units, it is
necessary to keep our attention on the positioning and
trends of the RAF in the Far East region while also
keeping in mind the trends of units in other regions.


**(3) Naval Forces**
The Pacifi c Fleet is stationed or deployed at its main bases
in Vladivostok and Petropavlovsk. The fl eet is comprised
of approximately 260 ships with a total displacement
in the region of approximately 640,000 tons, including
approximately 20 major surface ships and approximately
20 submarines (approximately 15 of which are nuclear
powered submarines) with a total displacement of
approximately 320,000 tons. Additionally, it plans on
deploying four multipurpose Steregushchiy-class frigates

**(4) Air Forces**
In the Eastern Military District, Russia deploys
approximately 400 combat aircraft from its Air Force
and Navy combined. Existing models are being
modernized and new models, such as the Su-35 fi ghters
and the Su-34 fi ghter-bombers, are being introduced[21] to
improve their capabilities.


inherent territories of Japan. While the Russian troop
strength is thought to be far less than that at peak times,
one division is still stationed in Kunashiri and Etorofu
Islands. Furthermore, tanks, armored vehicles, various
types of artillery, and anti-air missiles are deployed.[22]

After then President Medvedev visited Kunashiri
Island for the fi rst time as head of state in November
2010, Russian ministers and others have made repeated
visits to the Northern Territories.[23] Between July and
September 2015, Prime Minister Medvedev and six
minister-level dignitaries also visited Etorofu Island,
among other areas. Also, Russia is proceeding with
the development of military facilities in the Northern
Territories.[24] In November 2016, Russia announced that
it deployed coastal (surface-to-ship) missiles to Etorofu
and Kunashiri Islands.[25] Although in February 2017,
Russian Minister of Defense Shoigu stated at a meeting

21 According to Military Balance 2018, in addition to 34 Su-35 fi ghters, 24 Su-34 fi ghter-bombers have been deployed to the Eastern Military District (11th Army of Air and Air Defence Force).

22 The 18th Machine Gun and Artillery Division, which is comprised of two regiments, is one of the few division units making up the RAF since most divisions were transformed into brigades due to
military reform, and is stationed on Etorofu and Kunashiri Islands. The Division aims to prevent landings, and participated in surprise inspections conducted in the Eastern Military District and elsewhere
in July 2013. The number of Russian military personnel stationed in this region in 1991 was approximately 9,500. At the Japan-Russia Defense Ministerial Meeting held in 1997, then Russian Defence
Minister Igor Rodionov revealed that the troops stationed in the Northern Territories had been reduced to 3,500 personnel by 1995. In July 2005, when then Russian Defence Minister Sergei Ivanov
visited the Northern Territories, he declared that Russia would neither increase nor decrease the troops stationed on the four islands, clarifying Russia’s intention to maintain the status quo. In February
2011, a senior offi cial of the General Staff was said to have stated that troops on the Northern Territories would be maintained at around 3,500 personnel in the process of reorganizing divisions
into brigades. In May 2014, Commander Sergey Surovikin of the Eastern Military District announced the buildup of military facilities on the Northern Territories. In August 2014, Russia opened a new
airport in Etorofu Island. Through such measures, Russia has stepped up its activities in the Northern Territories under de facto occupation.

23 After the visit, Kunashiri Island and Etorofu Island were visited by then First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov in December 2010, by then Regional Development Minister Viktor Basargin in January
to February 2011, followed by then Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov in May 2011. Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev visited Kunashiri Island and Suisho Island of the Habomai Islands
in September 2011. In addition, in January 2011, then Deputy Minister of Defence Dmitry Bulgakov, and in February 2011, then Minister of Defence Anatoliy Serdyukov visited Kunashiri Island and
Etorofu Island and inspected the units stationed there. Furthermore, Prime Minister Medvedev and three ministers visited Kunashiri Island in July 2012. In July 2015, Minister of Healthcare Veronika
Skvortsova visited Kunashiri Island and Shikotan Island, and in August 2015, Prime Minister Medvedev, Deputy Prime Minister and Presidential Plenipotentiary Envoy to the Far Eastern Federal District
Yury Trutnev, Minister for the Development of Russian Far East Galushka, and Minister of Education and Science Dmitry Livanov visited Etorofu Island. In September 2015, Minister of Agriculture
Alexander Tkachev visited Etorofu Island, and Minister of Transport Maksim Sokolov visited Kunashiri Island and Etorofu Island.

24 At a meeting held at the Ministry of Defence of Russia in December 2015, Minister of Defence Shoigu stated that a total of 392 buildings and facilities are actively being built in the military facility
areas on Etorofu and Kunashiri Islands. Subsequently, at a meeting held at the Ministry of Defence in January 2016, the Minister noted that completing infrastructure construction in the areas was
one of the priorities for 2016.

25 In March 2016, Russia’s Ministry of Defence announced that it planned to deploy surface-to-ship missiles “Bastion” and “Bal” to the Northern Territories and Chishima Islands before the end of the
year. In November 2016, Boyevaya Vakhta, a newsletter published by the Pacifi c Fleet, mentioned that a “Bastion” coastal missile unit is being rotated to Etorofu Island and a “Bal” coastal missile unit


-----

of the State Duma (lower house) that the deployment of a
division to the Northern Territories or the Chishima Islands
would be completed before the end of the year, details
such as location of the deployment and the type of service
are unknown. In January 2018, a government decree
was issued to allow for joint military and civilian use of
the new airport built in 2014 in Etorofu Island besides
Tennei military airfi eld. Concerning military exercises
and trainings, in February 2018, over 2,000 military
personnel participated in an anti-terrorism exercise in the
Northern Territories and the Chishima Islands, and it was
announced in March of that same year that a new Su-35
fi ghters jet would be redeployed to Etorofu Island from its
home base as part of a training exercise.
As described above, Russia continues to station RAF
in the Northern Territories, which are inherent territories
of Japan, and has recently been increasing the RAF’s
activities in the territories under de facto occupation.
Some point out that such developments refl ect the Russian
people’s heightened awareness of territorial integrity
due to the Ukrainian crisis, as well as the rising military
importance of the Northern Territories adjacent to the Sea
of Okhotsk, an operating area of SSBN.[26]

During the Japan-Russia Foreign and Defense
Ministerial Meeting (2+2) held in March 2017, Japan
expressed it was regrettable that Russia had deployed
surface-to-ship missiles in the Northern Territories and
that Russia may deploy a new division to the islands
including the Four Northern Islands. Closer attention
must be paid to Russian military movements in the Far
East, including the Northern Territories.

3 Operations in the Vicinity of Japan


In the vicinity of Japan, the RAF has been generally
increasing its activities, including exercises and drills
which are believed to be conducted for objectives such as
verifying the results of the military reform.


In September 2014, the strategic command and staff
exercise Vostok 2014, considered the largest and the most
important of the RAF exercises and drills conducted that
year, was carried out in the Eastern Military District.
Over 155,000 personnel, over 4,000 combat vehicles,
approximately 80 vessels, and approximately 630
aircraft participated in the exercise.[27] It is regarded
that its purpose was to verify the combat readiness and
mobilization postures of the units in the Far East strategic
front, including the Arctic. The exercise included units
from not only the Eastern Military District, but also the
Western and Central Military Districts. The various units
conducted long-distance maneuvers covering a distance
of 12,000 km at most. For Vostok 2018, which will be
held in Siberia and the Arctic sometime in August and
September 2018, there are plans for participation of units
not only in the Eastern Military District, but also the
Central Military District and the Northern Fleet.
The number of exercises carried out by the Russian
Land Forces in the areas adjacent to Japan has decreased
from the peak. However, its activities are generally
increasing.
With regard to naval vessels, their activities are
generally increasing in recent years. For example, various
exercises and long distance voyages have been carried
out by Pacifi c Fleet vessels, along with assigned missions
involving operations in Syria and patrols by nuclearpowered submarines.[28] In September 2011, 24 naval
vessels including a Slava-class guided missile cruiser
passed through the Soya Strait in succession. This was
the fi rst time since the end of the Cold War that such a
major transit of this strait by Russian naval vessels was
confi rmed.[29] In recent years, ten or more Russian naval
vessels have passed through the Soya Strait one to three
times a year. Additionally, survey activities have taken
place on Matsuwa Island located roughly in the middle
of the Chishima Islands, with the objective of studying
the feasibility of deploying Pacifi c Fleet’s forces there


26 In Soviet Military Power 1989, the U.S. DoD refers to “Bastion” as the activity area of SSBN to be protected by land, sea, and air assets while utilizing topography in the territorial waters of the former
Soviet Union. It was assumed that in the Pacifi c region, the former Soviet Union had set up a “Bastion” mainly in Okhotsk Sea. Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Navy stated that regular long-term
patrols of SSBN, which were greatly curtailed since the former Soviet Union, would be restarted in 2012.

27 The large-scale exercise Vostok 2014 was conducted over a vast area extending from the Arctic to the coastal area. In the Kamchatka Peninsula, ALCM launches were carried out from long-range
bombers, as well as launches of SLCMs from Oscar II-class nuclear-powered guided missile submarines (SSGN). In Wrangel Island in the Arctic, night-time parachute landings and survival drills
were conducted. In the Sakhalin, the Naval Infantry conducted landing drills as well as drills to prevent the landings of opposing forces. In the coastal and inland areas, drills including the launches
of short-range ballistic missiles and GLCMs using the “Iskander” surface-to-surface missile system, as well as drills that made use of private infrastructure, such as takeoff and landing drills of the
Su-25 attack aircraft using roads for motor vehicles were conducted.

28 The number of cases of the Russian naval fl eet passing through the three international straits (Soya, Tsugaru, and Tsushima) of Japan that have been identifi ed and released in FY2017 is as follows:
12 cases in the Soya Strait (18 in FY2016, 22 in FY2015, 10 in FY2014); 1 case in the Tsugaru Strait (1 in FY2016, 0 in FY2015, 1 in FY2014); and 3 cases in the Tsushima Strait (7 in FY2016, 4
in FY2015, 8 in FY2014).

in the future, and it is said that a new runway has been
completed on that island as well.[30] There are also reports
that bases will be constructed on Matsuwa Island
as well as Paramushir Island, located in the north of
Chishima Islands, and that there are plans to deploy
Bal and Bastion surface-to-air missiles there. Attention
must be paid to movement towards the construction
of a coastal defense system covering the Northern
Territories and Chishima Islands.
Regarding aircraft, since the resumption of the patrol
activities by its strategic aviation units in 2007, Russia
has been increasing fl ights by long-range bombers. Also,
there were fl ights of Tu-95 long-range bombers refueled
in mid-fl ight and supported by A-50 early warning aircraft

5  Relations with Other Countries


and Su-27 fi ghters as well as fl ights of Tu-160.[31]
Russian aircraft were particularly active in FY2014
during the height of tensions in Ukraine, and in April the
same year when eastern Ukraine began to destabilize,
unusual fl ights took place with Tu-95 long-range bombers
conducting fl ights around Japan on four occasions in one
month. On two of these occasions, a total of six Tu-95
fl ew on the same day.[32]
Russian aircraft activities continue to be active, as
shown by the higher number of scrambles against Russian
aircraft compared to the previous year, and the fl ights by
Tu-95 long-range bombers around Japan in August 2017.

based on its National Security Strategy, Russia engages
in open, rational, and pragmatic diplomacy to protect
its national interests. It aims to pursue multidirectional
diplomacy by ruling out futile confrontation and acquiring
as many partners as possible around the world.[34]


1 General Situation


Russia considers the realization of its national interests as
a guiding principle of its foreign policy, recognizing the
multipolarization of international relations, the shift of
global power to the Asia-Pacifi c region, and the growing
importance of force in international relations.[33] Moreover,

30 In May 2016, the Russian Ministry of Defence announced that under the command of Vice Admiral Andrei Ryabukhin, Deputy Commander of the Pacifi c Fleet that arrived in Matsuwa Island, an
expedition comprised of approximately 200 personnel including representatives from the Russian Ministry of Defence, the Russian Geographical Society, the Eastern Military District, and the Pacifi c
Fleet began conducting survey activities. Colonel-general Sergei Surovikin, Commander of the Eastern Military District, stated at a military meeting of the district that six Pacifi c Fleet vessels and over
200 personnel participated in an expedition by the Russian Ministry of Defence and the Russian Geographical Society to Chishima, Etorofu, and Kunashiri Islands, and that its primary objective was
to study the feasibility of establishing a Pacifi c Fleet base in the future. Furthermore, Russia’s Ministry of Defense announced that three ships of the Pacifi c Fleet and around 100 personnel arrived on
Matsuwa Island in June 2017 in order to conduct a secondary survey. Sakhalin.info reported in October 2017 that a new runway had been completed on Matsuwa Island, and that it was accepting
aircraft landings around the clock. The Russian military newspaper Red Star reported that Russia’s Pacifi c Fleet is currently developing a military airport on the island that has the capacity to receive
military light transport aircraft and rotorcraft.

31 The Russian Ministry of Defence announced in January 2014 that surveillance fl ights of two Tu-95 long-range bombers took place with the assistance of Su-27 fi ghters and A-50 airborne early
warning and control aircraft.

32 The number of times Russian military aircraft fl ew around Japan since FY2013 was: one time in FY2013; six times in FY2014; two times in FY2015; one time in FY2016; and one time in FY2017.

34 The National Security Strategy of the Russian Federation (December 2015) states that, “With a view to protecting its national interests Russia is pursuing an open, rational, and pragmatic foreign


-----

For this reason, Russia has been working
on deepening its economic partnerships with the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).[35]

Furthermore, Russia aspires to deepen its relations
with the Asia-Pacifi c countries, seen as drivers of the
global economy,[36] and in recent years, has attached
importance to China and India as countries with which to
strengthen bilateral relations. Meanwhile, Russian efforts
to strengthen its cooperative relations with the West are
still facing challenges after the Ukrainian crisis. However,
with regard to the Syrian situation, Russia is exploring the
possibility of cooperation with other countries towards
stabilizing Syria and countering international terrorist
organizations, including ISIL.
Attention will be paid to how Russia would balance its
posture of economic-centered and benefi t-focused foreign
policy with Russia’s politics and diplomacy including
security, and develop its relations with other countries.


Under this policy, Russia has participated in various
frameworks in the Asia-Pacifi c region.[41] Since 2015, the
Eastern Economic Forum has been held in Vladivostok
for accelerating the economic development of Eastern
Russia and expanding international cooperation with the
Asia-Pacifi c region.
Russia continues to advance close military
cooperation with China. Export agreements on new
armaments such as the S-400 surface-to-air missile and
Su-35 fi ghter jets were concluded in 2015, and since
2012, China and Russia have been conducting joint
naval exercise “Joint Sea.” Russia also continues broad
military cooperation with India. Export agreements
were concluded in 2016 for new armaments such as
the S-400 surface-to-air missiles and Grigorovich-class
frigates, and both countries have been conducting joint
development of the fi fth generation fi ghter and the
“BrahMos” supersonic cruise missile. Additionally,
both Russia and India continue to conduct the joint
exercise “INDRA” involving the armies and navies of
both countries.[42] Regarding the relationship with Japan,
Russia states that it will develop mutually benefi cial
cooperation and is intensifying its approach in many
fi elds including politics, economy and security.


2 Relations with Asian Countries


Russia recognizes that the signifi cance of the Asia-Pacifi c
region is increasing within its multi-pronged foreign policy,
and considers it strategically important to strengthen its
status in the region from the viewpoint of socioeconomic
development in Siberia and the Far East,[37] and security.[38]
In the executive order concerning foreign policy issued in
May 2012, President Putin upheld his policy to participate
in the integration process of the Asia-Pacifi c region in
order to accelerate socioeconomic development in the
East Siberia and Far East regions, and stated that Russia
would make efforts to develop relationships with Japan,
the ROK, and other countries, along with China,[39] India,
and Vietnam. To achieve strategic stability and equal
strategic partnerships, Russia places particular emphasis
on developing a comprehensive partnership relationship
and strategic cooperative relationship with China as a key
factor in maintaining global and regional stability, and
also intends to assign an important role for the privileged
strategic partnership with India.[40]


35 In October 2011, eight CIS countries (Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Ukraine, Moldova, and Armenia) signed the CIS Free Trade Zone Agreement.

his recognition that the importance of the entire Asia-Pacifi c region was rising.

39 See Chapter 2, Section 3-3 for the relationship with China.

40 The National Security Strategy of the Russian Federation (December 2015) states that, “The Russian Federation will develop its comprehensive partnership relationship and strategic cooperative
relationship with the People’s Republic of China as a key factor for maintaining global and regional stability. The Russian Federation will assign an important role to the privileged strategic partnership
with the Republic of India.”

open to question whether this should be assessed as the
operational capability of the aircraft carrier.
In December 2016, Syrian government troops gained
control of strategically located Aleppo, where fi ghting
has continued involving Syrian government troops,
opposition forces, Kurdistan troops, and ISIL fi ghters.
At the end of the same month, a nationwide ceasefi re
agreement brokered by Russia and Turkey took effect
between the Assad administration and opposition forces.
While Russia has continued to fi ght ISIL and Hay'at
Tahrir al-Sham (HTS; formerly the “al-Nusra Front”)
since January 2017, it has also held Syrian peace talks in
Astana, Kazakhstan together with Syria and Iran. Russia
has been increasing its presence in the Middle East by
promoting initiatives that aim for political resolutions
in the future, such as the establishment of a ceasefi re
monitoring organization and de-escalation areas.
In December 2017, President Putin visited a base in
Syria, where he announced that the fi ght against terrorism
in the country had been largely resolved, that Russia
would continue to operate two permanent bases within
Syria, and that he had decided that most of the Russian
forced in Syria would be redeployed back to Russia. It
is expected that Russia will prioritize a process towards
political resolution while reducing its military campaign
in Syria. Attention will continue to be paid to movement

3 Situation in Ukraine


As antagonism between Ukraine and Russia has continued
since 2014, Ukraine has shifted away from non-alignment
policy that Ukraine once held and is pursuing efforts to
join NATO. In March 2018, President Poroshenko stated
that Ukraine would participate in a NATO Membership
Action Plan (MAP).[43] Sporadic clashes between
Ukrainian troops and separatist armed forces continue in
the eastern part of the country, with over 10,000 people
reported to have died since April 2014. Furthermore, the
political processes set out in the Minsk agreements seem
to have stalled, including the holding of local elections
and allowing more autonomy in the areas controlled by
separatists. The unstable situation in eastern Ukraine and
the Russian “annexation” of Crimea have taken on aspects
of being entrenched. A proposal has been put forth to
establish a United Nations mission with peacekeeping
force in eastern Ukraine. Russia asserts that this force
should only work along the contact line, while the United
States and others argue that the forces work within the
entire occupied territory, including along national border
between Ukraine and Russia. Developments related to
this issue will be paid attention in the future.

4 Situation in Syria


Since September 2015, while acquiring Tartus Naval
Base and Khmeimim Air Base as bases of its operations in
Syria, the Russian military has conducted aerial bombing
using fi ghter-bombers and long-range bombers as well as
fi red cruise missiles from surface vessels and submarines
deployed to the Caspian Sea and Mediterranean.[44] Russia’s
Ministry of Defence announced in November 2016 that
the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov deployed to
the eastern part of the Mediterranean launched aircraft
and conducted airstrikes on land-based targets for the
fi rst time in Russia’s naval history. These aircraft from the
aircraft carrier are reported to have fl own 420 sorties over
a two-month period, bombing a total of 1,252 terrorist
facilities. It has been pointed out, though, that most of
these sorties were fl own from Khmeimim Air Base since
the aircraft was moved from the aircraft carrier to the
Air Base soon after the airstrike began. It is therefore

to participate in NATO in the future.

to enhance the infl uence of Russia in the Middle East,
including Syria.

[See] Chapter 3, Section 1 (Trends in Regional Confl ict and

International Terrorism)

The objectives of Russian military intervention may
include: (1) to sustain the Assad administration which
is friendly to Russia; (2) to defend Russian interests
including its military bases in Syria; (3) to address the
threat of international terrorist organizations including
ISIL; and (4) to secure infl uence in the Middle East. Thus
far, Russia seems to have contributed to the recovery of
the Assad administration’s areas of control and protecting
Russian interests. Additionally, the use of cruise missiles
and strategic bombers in the attacks has demonstrated
Russia’s long-range precision strike capabilities.
Considering the signifi cant infl uence of Russia’s military
intervention on the course of the Assad administration,
coupled with the expanding partnerships between Russia
and surrounding countries such as Turkey and Iran,
Russia’s infl uence on future stability in Syria and on the
political settlement process cannot be neglected.


5 Relations with Commonwealth of
Independent States

Russia positions the development of bilateral and
multilateral cooperation with the CIS as the top foreign
policy priority. Russia considers that its vital interests are
concentrated in the territories of the CIS,[45] and deploys
its troops in Ukraine (Crimea), Moldova (Transnistria[46]),
Armenia, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Georgia (South
Ossetia, Abkhazia), which withdrew from the CIS in
August 2009.[47] Through the conclusion of an alliance and
strategic partnership treaty with Abkhazia in November
2014, the conclusion of an alliance with South Ossetia
in 2015, and other efforts,[48] Russia has been working to
ensure its military infl uence.[49]

Due to increasing activities by Islamic armed
insurgents in Central Asia and the Caucasus, Russia
has been pursuing military cooperation primarily on
counterterrorism measures in the region, and organized
the Collective Rapid Deployment Force in May 2001
within the framework of the CIS Collective Security
Treaty Organization (CSTO).[50] Furthermore, in June 2009,
a permanent joint rapid reaction force was established
to strengthen the functions of the CIS Collective Rapid
Deployment Force.[51]


45 In August 2008, following the confl ict with Georgia, then President Medvedev indicated that one of the fi ve principles of Russia’s foreign policy was that there are regions in which Russia has privileged
interests.

46 In Transnistria, located on the eastern side of the Dniester River, ethnic Russian residents declared separation and independence from Moldova in 1990, but it was never recognized as such by the
international community. Following the “annexation” of Crimea into Russia, in March 2014 the “Parliament” of Transnistria urged Russia to also incorporate the region. Moreover, during a telephone
conference between President Putin and then President Barack Obama in March 2014, President Putin pointed out that Transnistria was experiencing a blockade. A Russian unit of approximately
1,500 troops is currently stationed in Transnistria.

47 After the confl ict with Russia in August 2008, Georgia withdrew from the CIS in August 2009, but Russia unilaterally recognized the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia in the Georgian
territory and continues to have troops stationed in the regions. In the parliamentary election in October 2012 “Georgian Dream,” an opposition alliance with a campaign promise of improving Georgia
Russia relations, defeated the ruling “United National Movement” that adopts an anti-Russian policy. In the presidential election of October 2013, Giorgi Margvelashvili, backed by “Georgian Dream,”
was elected and became president in November of the same year. In his inauguration speech, President Margvelashvili stated that he was ready to deepen the dialogue with Russia, expressing his
intention to continue with pro-Euro, pro-U.S. lines while pursuing improvement of the relationship with Russia.

48 Russia’s “Military Doctrine” revised in December 2014 states that Russia would promote cooperation with the Republic of Abkhazia and the Republic of South Ossetia aimed at shared defense and
security.

49 While some CIS countries continue to prioritize their relations with Russia, such as Belarus and Kazakhstan, others attempt to maintain a distance from Russia. In addition to Georgia which has already
withdrawn from CIS and Ukraine which is announcing plans to withdrawal, countries such as Azerbaijan and Moldova have taken mostly pro-Western policies to reduce their security and economic
dependence on Russia. In September 2012, Kyrgyzstan and Russia agreed on a 15-year extension of the period of the use of Russian military bases in Kyrgyzstan, which otherwise would end in
2017. In October 2012, Tajikistan and Russia agreed to extend the lease of the base of Russia’s 201st Motor Rifl e Division in Tajikistan until 2042. In December 2013, Su-27 fi ghters of the Russian
naval force were deployed in Belarus for the fi rst time.

50 In May 1992, leaders of six countries (Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) signed the Collective Security Treaty (CST) in Toshkent, Uzbekistan. In 1993, Azerbaijan,
Georgia and Belarus joined the treaty, which came into effect in April 1994. However, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Uzbekistan withdrew from the treaty in 1999 without renewing it. In May 2002, CST was
reorganized into the CSTO. Uzbekistan returned to CST in August 2006 but gave notice to suspend its participation in CSTO in June 2012, effectively withdrawing from the organization.

51 Learning from the fact that CSTO could not suffi ciently respond to the request by Kyrgyzstan for the peace-keeping activities at the time of the ethnic confl ict in the southern part of Kyrgyzstan in June
2010, CSTO has been discussing improvement in the effi ciency of its crisis response system. The CSTO Summit Meeting in December 2011 warned against the foreign forces’ stationing in a member
state by requiring the consent of all member states when any member state builds a base of a third country. CSTO joint exercises, Vzaimodeistvie (cooperative operation), has been implemented every

In addition, out of concern that the worsening
security in Afghanistan could lead to the destabilization of
Central Asia, Russia and Central Asian countries support
Afghanistan while considering measures to strengthen
the security of the Afghan border.[52]

6 Relations with the United States


President Putin has striven to deepen cooperative
relations with the United States in the economic domain,
while opposing the United States on any action Russia
considers as “a U.S. attempt to encroach on Russia’s
strategic interests.”
Russia strongly opposed the deployment plan of
the MD system in Europe by the United States, stating
that it would have a negative impact on Russia’s nuclear
deterrent capabilities. Following the start of operations of
a U.S. MD system in Romania in May 2016, President
Putin noted that the deployment of MD systems in
Europe was continuing despite the end of the threat posed
by Iranian nuclear weapons and missiles, and stated
that Russia would do everything necessary to maintain
strategic military force parity.
Russia feels that the deployment of the U.S. MD
system in Europe and the Asia-Pacifi c undermines global
and regional security. While expressing its concerns
over the U.S. MD system, Russia is also seeking the
enhancement of its strategic nuclear forces, including
missiles that can reliably breakthrough MD systems.
However, following Russia’s actions in connection
with the situation in Ukraine, the United States announced
suspension of the military exchanges with Russia in
March 2014.[53] In addition, the United States dispatched
a missile destroyer to the Black Sea and provided nonlethal weapons to the Ukrainian Government.[54] In March
2018, the U.S. Department of State approved the sale of
anti-tank missiles to Ukraine. The Russian Ministry of
Foreign Affairs criticized this move, stating that it would


not help to bring an end to the confl ict in Ukraine.
In regard to the situation in Syria, there were some
positive developments, including the recognition of the
importance of U.S.-Russia cooperation to eliminate ISIL, a
U.N.-led political resolution to the confl ict, and provisional
safe zones as shown in a joint statement released at the U.S.Russia Summit Meeting held in November 2017. However,
antagonism between the two countries is ongoing, with
both the U.S. and Russia criticizing each other over the
alleged use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime in
April 2017, and also the missile strikes against Syria by
the U.S., the U.K., and France in April 2018. At the U.S.Russia summit meeting held in July 2018, disarmament
issues as well as international affairs including North
Korea and Syria were discussed with the recognition to
improve the deteriorated U.S.-Russia relations; however,
its outlook on improvement remains unclear.

International Terrorism)


7 Relations with Europe and NATO


Through the framework of the NATO-Russia Council
(NRC), Russia has worked with NATO as an equal
partner in the areas of common interest, such as by
participating in certain decision-making processes.
However, following the Ukrainian crisis, NATO and
European countries suspended their practical cooperation
with Russia, including that in the military domain, except
for the NRC’s ambassador-level meetings.[55] Additionally,
NATO and European countries have maintained a severe
diplomatic stance towards Russia while working together
with the Ukrainian Government.
At the NRC summit held in Lisbon in November
2010 prior to the suspension of working level cooperation,
Russia and NATO would work towards building a true and
modernized strategic partnership. They have continued
searching for possibilities of dialogue and cooperation in


52 At the Expanded Meeting of the Russian Defence Ministry Board in December 2013, President Putin said that the withdrawal of the ISAF from Afghanistan in 2014 would be a destabilizing element
not only to Afghanistan but also to Central Asia and could pose a threat to the national interests and security of Russia.

53 Following the occupation of the Crimean Peninsula by Russia, then U.S. DoD Spokesperson Kirby announced in March 2014 that the United States would cease all military exchange with Russia,
including joint exercises with the RAF, consultations, and port calls.

54 The United States provided non-lethal weapons such as body armor, helmets, vehicles, night and thermal vision devices, heavy engineering equipment, advanced radios, patrol boats, rations, tents,
counter mortar radars, uniforms, fi rst aid equipment, and other related items to Ukraine.

55 NATO issued a statement condemning Russia over the situation in Ukraine, and has deployed additional military forces to countries in Eastern Europe and the Baltic. However, there are discrepancies

of its collective defense.[57]

Russia revealed that it has deployed two army
divisions near the border with Ukraine, and one army
division near its border with Belarus, and Russia
conducted the strategic command and staff exercise
Zapad 2017 in its Western Military District and Belarus
in September 2017.[58] That exercise was brought up at the
NATO-Russia Council meeting held in October of that
same year, where it was pointed out that the number of
actually participating soldiers and the area used for the
exercise were larger than indicated in the announcement
made by Russia prior to the exercise. However, there
were no invasions into other countries by Russia, and no
Russian units stayed in Belarus following the exercise,
which were points of concern.
Russia’s Foreign Policy Concept announced in
November 2016 states that containment policies of the
United States and its allies undermine regional and
global stability, and Russia would maintain its negative
perspective towards NATO expansion.


fi elds such as MD, Afghanistan, cooperation on counterterrorism, and anti-piracy measures. With regard to MD
cooperation, no progress was made on Russia-NATO
relations. For example, the talks at the meeting of NRC
defense ministers held in June 2011 highlighted the
difference in position between NATO advocating MD
cooperation in which only information and data would be
exchanged under the two independent systems of NATO
and Russia, and Russia aiming at “sector MD” in which
both sides operate integrally by setting zones for each
country’s responsibility under a unifi ed MD system of
NATO and Russia.
Meanwhile, there remains an unsolved issue between
Russia and NATO regarding the Conventional Armed
Forces in Europe (CFE) agreement.[56]

Furthermore, the Ukrainian crisis has represented
existing threat to NATO’s eastern border for the fi rst
time since the Cold War. Consequently, some of NATO’s
member states in Eastern Europe and the Baltic harbor
national security concerns. For this and other reasons,
NATO continues to take steps to ensure the effectiveness


8 Exportation of Arms


Russia seems to actively promote the export of arms not
only to maintain the infrastructure of its military industry
and to make economic profi t, but also to help promote
better foreign policy. The country’s export value has been
increasing in recent years.[59] In January 2007, the Russian
Government granted the exclusive authority to export
arms to the Rosoboron Export State Corporation as part
of its ongoing initiatives to improve its export system. In
addition, Russia regards its military industry as an integral
part of the nation’s military organization and is committed
to improving and further developing the military industry
by such measures as promoting the integration of aircraft


56 At the 1999 Istanbul summit of the OSCE, an agreement was reached on changing the troop ceilings set formerly by blocks to those set by country and territory and on complying with the current CFE
Treaty until the adapted CFE Treaty comes into effect. Russia was dissatisfi ed with the fact that despite its ratifi cation of the adapted CFE Treaty, NATO member states refused to ratify the Treaty on the
grounds that the RAF were not withdrawing from Georgia and Moldova. Therefore, in December 2007, Russia suspended the implementation of the CFE Treaty and halted inspections based on this
treaty. Presently, only four countries have ratifi ed the adapted CFE Treaty—Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine—and it has not yet come into effect. In addition, Russia has proposed dissolving
the existing security framework that has NATO at its center and creating a new European security treaty that would provide new fundamental principles for security in Europe and the Atlantic region.

57 See Chapter 2, Section 8 for more about NATO’s initiatives.

58 Russia’s strategic command and staff exercises are held under the command of its joint strategic commands. Management of the military exercises are handled by each military district each year in
a round robin format. In 2017, Zapad 2017 was held in the Western Military District and Belarus. According to a Russian Defense Ministry announcement, approximately 12,700 personnel, 10 ships,
70 aircraft and helicopters, and 250 tanks participated in this exercise.

59 According to SIPRI, Russian arms exports between 2013 and 2017 increased by 7% compared to that of the period between 2008 and 2012. Russia has the second largest share of arms exports

companies such as Sukhoi, MiG, and Tupolev.
Russia exports equipment such as fi ghters and vessels
to countries including India, China, Algeria, ASEAN
member states, and Venezuela.[60] Russia concluded an
agreement with China to sell new Su-35 fi ghters and the
S-400 surface-to-air missile system. Deliveries of the
Su35 fi ghters[61] have already begun at the end of 2016,
and plans call for a total of 24 of these aircraft to be


delivered to China by 2018. It has been pointed out that
this deal was made possible because the interests of China
and Russia coincided: while China promotes indigenous
weapons production, it still needs Russian technology for
state-of-the-art equipment, whereas Russia aims to avoid
diplomatic isolation caused by the Ukrainian crisis and to
gain economic profi t through arms exports.[62]


60 Russia has delivered to Indonesia 5 Su-27 fi ghters and 11 Su-30 fi ghters. Furthermore, it was reported in 2016 that Russia signed an agreement to sell 11 Su-35 fi ghters to Indonesia. To date, Russia
has delivered 18 Su-30 fi ghters to Malaysia and 12 Su-27 fi ghters and 36 Su-30 fi ghters to Vietnam. There are also reports of a sales contract with Vietnam for Kilo-class submarines. All six of these
submarines were delivered to Vietnam by January 2017. With regard to India, aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov, which had been refurbished in Severodvinsk, was delivered to India, renamed as INS
Vikramaditya in November 2013, which arrived in India in January 2014. Moreover, to date, Russia has delivered to Algeria 52 Su-30 fi ghters and to Venezuela 24 Su-30 fi ghters. Russia’s exports to
China have included Su-27 and Su-30 fi ghters, Sovremenny-class destroyers, and Kilo-class submarines. Against the backdrop of the advancement of indigenous weapon production in China, some
point out that the value of Russian exports to China has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, Russia has continued to export equipment such as aircraft engines for repair purposes. With
regard to Iran, Russia started exporting the “S-300” surface-to-air missile system in April 2016.

61 According to reports, contracts have been concluded to export 24 Su-35 fi ghter jets for approximately USD 2 billion and to export 32 S-400 missile launchers for approximately USD 30 billion. A total
of 14 Su-35 fi ghter jets were delivered by 2017.

**Section 5 Australia**


1 General Situation


Australia maintains a special strategic partnership with
Japan and shares universal values, such as strategic
interests, respect for freedom and human rights, and
democracy. It is allied with the United States, as are
Japan and the ROK.
In Australia, in September 2015, Malcolm Turnbull
was elected to lead the ruling Liberal Party. As a result,
the Turnbull administration from the conservative
coalition was formed. In July 2016, both the upper and
lower houses were dissolved simultaneously for the fi rst
time in 29 years. Turnbull continues to be prime minister
of a conservative coalition that controls the lower house.[1]
The former Abbott administration criticized the defense
spending cuts of the previous Labor Party administration,
and signaled its intention to actively make investments
which are deemed necessary for building a stronger
defense force. This policy has continued under the
Turnbull administration.
The Defence White Paper released in February 2016

2 Security and Defense Policies


states that over the next two decades, the Australian
Government will make important investments to maintain
a high level of capability of the ADF, setting out a plan to
continue to increase the troop strength and acquire high
performance equipment. The white paper states explicitly
that defense funding would be increased over the next
decade, setting a specifi c target to reach 2% of Australia’s
GDP by 2020. With regard to Australia’s international
relationships, the white paper sets forth that Australia
would aim to mature and deepen practical engagement
with partners across the Indo-Pacifi c, including Japan,
while continuing to give highest priority to its alliance
with the United States. To achieve its strategic defense
objective of contributing military capabilities to
coalition operations that support Australia’s interests in
a rules-based global order, Australia makes proactive
contributions to the peace and stability of the international
community through the deployment of ADF to overseas
operations, among other efforts.

favorable international environment. On this basis, the
Strategy outlines the following priorities for the next
fi ve years: (1) enhanced engagement in the Asia-Pacifi c
region;[3] (2) integrated cyber policy and operations;[4] and
(3) effective partnerships.[5]

The Defense White Paper released in February 2016
presents[6] an outlook of Australia’s security environment
over the next two decades. It then outlines the direction
of Australia’s defense strategy for dealing with this
environment, and the development of the defense force
pursuant to this strategy.


The Australian Government launched its fi rst National
Security Strategy (the Strategy) in January 2013.[2] The
Strategy provides a blueprint for national security
over the next decade, presenting the recognition that
responding to the economic and strategic changes in
the Asia-Pacifi c region is vital to the national security
of Australia. The Strategy defi nes four objectives for
the country’s national security: (1) to ensure a safe
and resilient population; (2) to protect and strengthen
Australia’s sovereignty; (3) to secure Australia’s assets,
infrastructure and institutions; and (4) to promote a


In this election, the conservative coalition comprised of the Liberal, National, and other parties won a majority 76 out of the 150 lower house seats, resulting in Prime Minister Turnbull continuing on
as leader, although the coalition lost a large number of seats from its initial total of 89. In the upper house, the coalition aimed to capture seats from minority parties through election reform but failed
to obtain a majority, and may continue to encounter diffi culties with government administration going forward. Actually, the Turnbull coalition briefl y fell into the minority in the Australian parliament in
November 2017 following a resignation by a parliament member due to a dual-citizenship issue. However, currently, Turnbull’s coalition holds a narrow majority.

This strategy is based on the National Security Statement, announced in December 2008, which articulated Australia’s national security agenda and set in motion reforms to strengthen the National
Security Community. The national security strategy is scheduled to be revised every fi ve years.

Specifi cally, this includes: 1) deepening the Australia-U.S. Alliance; 2) enhancing bilateral cooperation with infl uential regional countries such as China, Indonesia, Japan, the ROK, and India; and 3)
promoting the superiority and effectiveness of multilateral forums.

The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) integrates the capabilities of Australia’s Department of Defence, Attorney-General’s Department, and Federal Police and the cyber-related personnel of
the Australian Crime Commission.

This includes sharing information securely and quickly with domestic and international partners and strengthening information sharing between government and business.

The Defence White Paper of Australia presents the government’s future plan and measures for national defense. It was previously published in 1976 (Fraser Liberal Party administration), 1987 (Hawke
Labor Party administration), 1994 (Keating Labor Party administration), 2000 (Howard Liberal Party administration), 2009 (Rudd Labor Party administration), 2013 (Gillard Labor Party administration),

Specifi cally, the white paper maintains that while
there is little prospect of a military attack on Australian
territory in the period to 2035,[7] Australia will face new
complexities and challenges. Based on this understanding,
three strategic defense interests are identifi ed, namely: a
secure, resilient Australia (including the security of sea
lanes); a secure nearer region; and a stable Indo-Pacifi c
region and a rules-based global order. Additionally,
three strategic defense objectives are given, which are:
(1) Deter, deny, and defeat attacks on or threats to Australia
and its national interests; (2) Make military contributions
to support the security of maritime Southeast Asia and
support the governments of South Pacifi c countries to
build and strengthen their security; and (3) Contribute
military capabilities to coalition operations that support
Australia’s interests in a rules-based global order. To
maintain the ADF’s high level of capability needed to
achieve these objectives, the Government will make
important investments. In addition to increasing the troop
strength by approximately 4,400 personnel,[8] Australia

3 Relations with Other Countries


will acquire high performance equipment, including
12 new submarines,[9] 3 air warfare destroyers (Aegis
vessels), 72 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, and 7 MQ4C
unmanned patrol aircraft. Simultaneously, Australia will
seek to strengthen ISR capabilities, electronic warfare
capabilities, and cyber security capabilities, as well as
strengthen the functions of its bases in northern Australia
and elsewhere. To support these programs by funding, the
white paper also presents the concrete target of increasing
defense funding to reach 2% of GDP by 2020.
In addition, with North Korea continuing to make
repeated, provocative actions unlike any seen in the past,
Prime Minister Turnbull announced in October 2017 that
Australia would be equipping nine of the future frigates
of the Royal Australian Navy with a missile defense
system (the Aegis system) that can intercept long-range
ballistic missiles, stating, “A number of states, notably
of course, North Korea, are developing missiles with
advanced range and speed. We must have the capability
to meet and defeat them.”[10]

Indonesia, Japan, the ROK, New Zealand, India, and
China, while continuing to give the highest priority to
its alliance with the United States. On November 2017,
Australia published the 2017 Foreign Policy White
Paper, Australia’s fi rst such white paper in 14 years. This
document too, emphasized this policy.[11]

[See] Part III, Chapter 2, Section 1-4-1 (Japan-Australia Defense

Cooperation and Exchanges)


In the Defence White Paper 2016, Australia subscribes
to the view that Australia’s security and prosperity
are directly linked to the development of the nearer
region, the Indo-Pacifi c region, and the global strategic
environment. Based on this view, Australia will build and
maintain international security relationships to achieve
its strategic defense objectives. In particular, Australia
will aim to mature and deepen practical engagement
with partners across the Indo-Pacifi c region, including


7 The white paper identifi es six factors that will shape the security environment of Australia over the next two decades: (1) the roles of the United States and China in the Indo-Pacifi c region and the
relationship between them; (2) challenges to the stability of the rules-based global order; (3) the threat of terrorism to Australians at home and abroad; (4) state fragility caused by uneven economic
growth, crime, social, environmental and governance challenges, and climate change; (5) the pace of military modernization and the development of more capable regional military forces; and (6) the
emergence of new complex, non-geographic threats (e.g., cyber threats). With regard to (5), the white paper notes that in the Indo-Pacifi c region, half of the world’s submarines and at least half of
the world’s advanced combat aircraft will be operating and more countries may acquire ballistic missile technology.

8 According to the white paper, over the next decade, the number of active duty ADF personnel would be increased to approximately 62,400 personnel from the current approximately 58,000 personnel.
If this is realized, the ADF would return to its largest size since 1993.

9 The Defence White Paper refers to the submarines to be acquired as “regionally superior submarines.” It explains that Australia would select the submarine classifi cation by the end of 2016, and
that the fi rst submarine would begin entering service in the early 2030s. Japan, Germany, and France participated in the submarine Competitive Evaluation Process. In April 2016, the Australian
Government announced that the French company DCNS was chosen as the partner for building the submarines. In August 2016, it was found that confi dential DCNS documents on its submarine
order for the Indian Navy had leaked, resulting in rising calls in Australia for a review of the deal. Prime Minister Turnbull emphasized that the submarines being built for Australia are a different type
than the one leaked, refuting the need for a review.

10 Following statements made by Foreign Minister Bishop in April 2017 to the effect that “the United States Administration did say that all options are on the table” and suggesting that Australia supports
this. In regard to North Korea, a spokesperson for the North Korean Foreign Ministry repeated the threat of nuclear attack against Australia, saying, “If Australia persists in following the US' moves to
isolate and stifl e North Korea … this will be a suicidal act of coming within the range of the nuclear strike of the strategic force of North Korea.”

11 The 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper recognizes that it is in the national interest of China to increase its infl uence, and concludes that there are instances in which Chinese infl uence is indeed greater
than U.S. infl uence in parts of the Indo-Pacifi c. Beyond that, it points out that Australia will expand strategic relations with democratic states that share similar aspirations with Australia, while also
ensuring the deepening of the Australia-U.S. Alliance. The White Paper also emphasizes that Australia will strengthen relationships, keeping in mind the “quad” states (Japan-U.S.-India-Australia) with

rotational deployment of the U.S. Marine Corps. From
October 2014, the ADF has been participating in the
combat mission of the U.S.-led operation against ISIL.
In July 2015, the two countries conducted a training in
which B-52 strategic bombers of the U.S. Forces were
fl own from the U.S. mainland to drop bombs on an air
weapons range in Australia and then returned to the
United States.[18] Under the Turnbull administration, at
the 30th AUSMIN in October 2015, the two sides signed
a joint statement on defense cooperation to serve as a
guideline for future defense cooperation, and reaffi rmed
their strong bilateral cooperation. In October 2016, costsharing negotiations for the Force Posture Initiatives
were concluded in principle.
AUSMIN was held in June 2017 where they decided
to further expand defense and security cooperation. As
a result, the detailed progress of these efforts will be a
focus of attention in the future.


1 Relations with the United States


In the Defence White Paper 2016, Australia states that its
alliance with the United States pursuant to the Security
Treaty between Australia, New Zealand and the United
States of America (ANZUS)[12] is based on shared values
and will continue to be the centerpiece of Australia’s
defense policy. Australia notes that the United States,
which remains the pre-eminent global military power
over the next two decades, will continue to be its most
important strategic partner, and the active presence of the
United States will continue to underpin the stability of
the region. It is stated that Australia thus welcomes and
supports the critical role of the United States in ensuring
stability in the Indo-Pacifi c region.
Since 1985, the two countries have been regularly
convening the Australia-United States Ministerial
Consultations (AUSMIN) to discuss major diplomatic
and security issues. On the operational front, the two
countries have made efforts to increase interoperability
through joint exercises, including Exercise Talisman
Saber.[13] Since April 2012, the U.S. Marine Corps have
conducted rotational deployments to northern Australia.[14]
On the equipment front, the two countries have been
simplifying the export procedures associated with
equipment deals pursuant to the Australia-U.S. Defence
Trade Cooperation Treaty that entered into force in May
2013. In addition, the two countries are considering the
joint development of the F-35 JSF and missile defense
cooperation.[15] Furthermore, bilateral cooperation is being
advanced in areas such as ISR, space,[16] and cyber.[17] In
August 2014, the two sides signed the Force Posture
Agreement which provides a legal framework for the


2 Relations with China


In the Defence White Paper 2016, Australia states that
its relationship with China is crucial in different ways
from its relationship with the United States, and that
it welcomes China’s continued economic growth and
the opportunities this is bringing for Australia and
other countries in the Indo-Pacifi c. It goes on to say
Australia is committed to continuing the development of
Australia’s defense relations with China, and working to
enhance mutual understanding, facilitate transparency,
and build trust.
Based on such a policy, Australia and China
continuously hold dialogues among their defense


12 A trilateral security treaty among Australia, New Zealand, and the United States, which went into effect in 1952. Since 1986, the United States has suspended its obligation to defend New Zealand
due to its adoption of a non-nuclear policy. The treaty is thus effective only between Australia and the United States and between Australia and New Zealand.

13 Exercise Talisman Saber, started in 2005, is a biennial combined U.S.-Australia training designed to improve combat readiness and interoperability. About 33,000 U.S. Forces and ADF personnel
participated in the exercise held from June to July 2017.

14 By way of the Force Posture Initiatives of November 2011, the United States and Australia announced that the U.S. Marine Corps would conduct rotational deployments approximately every six months
to Darwin and northern Australia. Accordingly, approximately 200 U.S. Marines were deployed in 2012 and 2013, 1,150 Marines in 2014 and 2015, approximately 1,250 Marines in 2016 and 2017,
and approximately 1,600 Marines in 2018. The Defence White Paper 2016 sets out that the size would be increased to approximately 2,500 Marines by 2020. In addition, under this same initiative,
access to Australian military facilities and areas in northern Australia by U.S. Air Force aircraft was set to be expanded, together with opportunities for joint exercises and training. Accordingly, in
February 2017, 12 F-22 fi ghter aircraft were deployed to Australia.

15 While Australia considers that the threat of an ICBM attack on Australia is low, it deems there is a possible threat of an attack on Australian territory by a long-range or submarine-launched ballistic
missile or cruise missile, as well as attack on the deployed ADF by a short-range ballistic missile or cruise missile. To counter such threats, Australia and the United States have launched a working
group to study options that could contribute to missile defense in the region.

16 Since signing the Space Situational Awareness Partnership in November 2010, Australia and the United States have promoted space cooperation, including the relocation of the U.S. C-band groundbased radar system and the Space Surveillance Telescope to Australia.

17 At the AUSMIN in September 2011, the two nations signed a joint statement on cyberspace and confi rmed that, mindful of their longstanding defense relationship and the ANZUS Treaty, the two would
consult together and determine appropriate options to address threats in the event of a cyber attack that threatens the territorial integrity, political independence, or security of either Australia or the
United States.

18 The statement envisions that greater competition for resources and territorial disputes will increase the possibility of miscalculation and the potential for confl ict in the Asia-Pacifi c and Indian Ocean
regions, and states that the two countries would further deepen their defense relationship to deal with this. Specifi cally, the statement sets forth: deeper interoperability; strengthened policy and

authorities,[19] along with exchanges to develop the
cooperative relations between their defense forces,
including joint exercises and mutual visits by vessels.[20]

During the Australia-China summit meeting held
in April 2016, an announcement was made about
connecting China’s “Belt and Road” Initiative with the
development of infrastructure in northern Australia, and
similar cooperation was brought to light also during the
Australia-China Foreign and Strategic Dialogue held in
February 2017.
Meanwhile, like the previous Abbott administration,
the Turnbull administration has been showing its wariness
toward China, by, among other ways, making Australia’s
position on China very clear. The Joint Statement of the
AUSMIN in October 2015, referring to China by name,
expresses strong concerns over recent land reclamation
and construction activity in the South China Sea, and
calls on all claimant states to halt militarization. When
the United States conducted the Freedom of Navigation
Operation in the South China Sea in the same month,
Minister for Defence Marise Payne of Australia issued
a statement expressing strong support for rights to
freedom of navigation and overfl ight under international
law. In July 2016, Minister for Foreign Affairs Bishop
announced, with regard to the fi nal ruling by the Arbitral
Tribunal on the case between the Philippines and China,
that Australia would support the rights of all countries
that resolve disputes peacefully following international
law, including the UNCLOS, and that Australia would
continue to exercise its rights related to the freedom of
overfl ight and the freedom of navigation pursuant to
international law.[21] In the Defence White Paper 2016,
Australia asserts that it will be important for regional
stability that China provides reassurance to its neighbors
by being more transparent about its defense policies, and


expresses particular concern with the unprecedented pace
and scale of China’s land reclamation activities in the
South China Sea. Furthermore, the 2017 Foreign Policy
White Paper contains statements to the effect that China
is challenging the position of the United States in the
Indo Pacifi c, the most important region for Australia.
In October 2015, the Government of the Northern
Territory leased to a Chinese company the rights to
operate the commercial wharfs of the Darwin Port, also
utilized by ADF and U.S. Force vessels.[22] After it became
clear that the Australian federal government did not lodge
objections,[23] saying there were no security concerns,
people expressed uneasiness within and outside of
Australia.[24] Later, deals involving Chinese companies
seeking to acquire Australian facilities continued to
emerge. In January 2017, the federal government of
Australia announced the establishment of a dedicated
center within the Attorney General’s Department, which
will identify facilities requiring surveillance and carefully
manage the risks for advising related institutions in order
to block the sale of important infrastructure related to
national security, including specifi c ports and harbor
facilities, to companies from other countries.
With China’s perceived infl uence on Australia
growing larger,[25] in December of that year, Prime
Minister Turnbull submitted a bill to the Australian
Parliament meant to prevent interference in domestic
affairs by foreign actors. That bill was passed into law in
June 2018.[26]


3 Relations with India


In the Defence White Paper 2016, Australia states that
it welcomes India’s increasingly active role in the IndoPacifi c region, and that it sees India as a key security


19 In July 2014, Fan Changlong, Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China, visited Australia, and held talks with then Prime Minister Abbott, then Minister for
Defence David Johnston, and others. The two sides agreed to hold a U.S.-China-Australia trilateral joint exercise. In addition, Australia and China have regularly convened a Defence Strategic Dialogue
since 1997. At the 20th Dialogue held in August 2017, Australian offi cials, including Vice Admiral Raymond James Griggs of the Royal Australian Navy and Rebecca Skinner, Deputy Secretary of
Strategic Policy and Intelligence of the Department of Defense, held talks with Major General Shao Yuanming, deputy chief of the Joint Staff of the PLA.

20 In January 2016, three PLA Navy vessels visited Brisbane, Australia to take part in navigation training together with RAN vessels. In August 2017, following on the previous year, KOWARI 2017, the
fourth survival training among the United States, China, and Australia, was conducted in northern Australia, with ten personnel participating from each country. In September 2017, Exercise Pandaroo
designed to build teamwork, friendship, and trust between the Australian and Chinese forces was carried out in southeastern Australia, with ten personnel participating from each country.

21 In response to China’s announcement of the “East China Sea ADIZ” in November 2013, Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop issued a statement saying Australia has made clear its opposition to
any coercive or unilateral actions to change the status quo in the East China Sea.

22 In addition, opposition parties and think tanks raised concerns over the fact that this Chinese company is thought to have close ties with the Communist Party of China and the PLA, and over the fact
that the U.S. Forces that utilize Darwin Port were not consulted in advance. According to press reports, then President Barack Obama requested Prime Minister Turnbull to provide advance notice.
Additionally, the Chinese company in question is currently expressing interest in a port near Adelaide where future submarines are slated to be built, raising further concerns.

23 The Government of Australia has struck down the acquisition of a farming company, S. Kidman & Co., which owns land equivalent to about 1% of Australia’s landmass and the acquisition of major
power company Ausgrid by Chinese companies due to reasons of national security.

24 The newly established Critical Infrastructure Centre is viewed as supporting the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) which screens individual projects and advises the Government.

25 According to Australian media reporting, it is clear that China has meddled in domestic affairs through large-scale political contributions and bribes from at least fi ve Chinese people.

26 The law requires the registration of the representatives of foreign governments or foreign companies doing lobbying activities in the Australian parliament, and imposes imprisonment in the event that

partner. Australia notes that it aims to further mature its
defense relationship with India in support of their shared
strategic interests.
The Australia-India relationship was elevated to a
strategic partnership in November 2009, and the two
countries have regularly conducted strategic dialogues,
mutual visits by senior military offi cers, interactions
among military services, and mutual dispatches of
students to military educational organizations. More
recently, in November 2014, Prime Minister of India
Narendra Modi visited Australia, marking the fi rst visit
to Australia by an Indian Prime Minister in 28 years.
The two leaders agreed to extend defense cooperation to
cover research, development, and industry engagement,
to hold regular meetings at the level of Defense
Minister and conduct regular maritime exercises, and to
convene talks between each of their military services.
Accordingly, in June 2015, two Indian Navy vessels
made a goodwill visit to Australia, and in September
2015, the fi rst bilateral joint naval exercise AUSINDEX
15[27] was conducted off the east coast of India. Mutual
exchanges between the two countries are steadily
progressing, including the holding of AUSINDEX 17
off the west coast of Australia in June 2017.

[See] Chapter 2, Section 7-1-2 (Military Affairs of India)


the maritime security of Southeast Asia and support the
governments of South Pacifi c and other countries to build
and strengthen their security.
Australia has been deepening its relations with
Indonesia in the security and defense fi elds following
the signing of the Lombok Treaty in November
2006, the elevation of their relationship to a strategic
partnership in March 2010, and the conclusion of the
Defence Cooperation Arrangement in September 2012.[28]
However, issues have emerged, including differences
in their responses to stowaways from Indonesia, the
case of wiretapping of the Indonesian President and
others by Australia’s intelligence agency, and the issue
of the execution of Australian nationals in Indonesia.[29]
Consequently, cooperative relations in the security and
defense fi elds stalled intermittently between the two
countries. Subsequently, in the second half of 2015,
mutual visits by ministers and higher-level offi cials
resumed, including the visit to Indonesia by Prime
Minister Turnbull. The Foreign and Defense Ministerial
Meeting (2+2) was held in November 2016, and the
bilateral relationship is seeing further improvements.
With Singapore and Malaysia, Australia carries
out regular joint combined exercises in the South China
Sea and other areas under the framework of the Five
Power Defence Arrangements.[30, 31] Australia considers
that Singapore is its most advanced defense partner, and
that they share Australia’s interest in a secure maritime
trading environment. Defense cooperation is also
deepening, including the signing of a memorandum of
understanding concerning military training and training
area development in Australia under the comprehensive
strategic partnership in October 2016. As regards
Malaysia, Australia stations the ADF in Royal Malaysian
Air Force (RMAF) Base Butterworth, and contributes
to maintaining regional security and stability through
patrol activities in the South China Sea and the northern
Indian Ocean.[32]
Australia plays a leading role in assisting Papua New

4 Relations with Southeast Asia and
South Pacifi c Countries


In the Defence White Paper 2016, Australia regards a
secure nearer region encompassing maritime Southeast
Asia and South Pacifi c as its strategic interest. In
particular, Australia considers that instability and
confl icts in Southeast Asia have the potential to threaten
Australia’s security and economic relations with countries.
Furthermore, Australia depends on maritime trade with
Southeast Asian countries and maritime trade that transits
Southeast Asia. In this regard, Australia perceives that
the security of these sea lanes must be ensured alongside
freedom of navigation. Based on this understanding,
Australia seeks to make military contributions to support


27 From Australia, three RAN vessels including a submarine and one patrol aircraft participated. From India, three Indian Navy vessels and one patrol aircraft participated.

28 The Lombok Treaty is a security cooperation framework that espouses wide-ranging cooperation in the defense fi eld. It entered into force in February 2008. The Defense Cooperation Arrangement
covers strengthened cooperation in counter-terrorism and maritime security.

29 In November 2013, it was reported that an Australian intelligence agency wiretapped the telephone calls of Indonesia’s previous President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Mrs. Yudhoyono, ministers, and
others. The Indonesian Government lodged strong protests, including summoning the Australian Ambassador to Indonesia and demanding an apology to the Australian Government. The Government
also announced the suspension of military exchanges and intelligence cooperation with Australia. In April 2015, two Australians were executed in Indonesia for helping to smuggle drugs, and the
Australian Government strongly protested to Indonesia.

30 See Chapter 2, Section 6, Footnote 5.

31 In Exercise Bersama Shield held in April 2016, more than 200 personnel, vessels including a submarine, and patrol aircraft of the ADF participated. In October 2016, Exercise Bersama Lima was held
in Malaysia, Singapore and South China Sea in which approximately 400 personnel, vessels, and patrol aircraft of the ADF participated.

disasters, and maritime patrol.[33] In particular, in the fi eld
of maritime patrol, Australia still regularly deploys ADF
assets to the South Pacifi c to assist with patrol activities. In
addition, in June 2014, Australia unveiled a plan to replace
the 22 patrol vessels it provided to these countries in the
past. In May 2018, Australia announced its largest ever aid
package for Pacifi c Island countries of AUS$1.3 billion,
with the intent of further strengthening relations.
With New Zealand, Australia has an alliance
pursuant to the ANZUS Treaty. The two countries hold
regular meetings by their leaders and defense ministers,
and have maintained close cooperative relations in the
security and defense fi elds through joint exercises and
joint activities in the region.

5 Overseas Activities


In the Defence White Paper 2016, Australia identifi es
the following strategic defense objective: to contribute
military capabilities to coalition operations that support
Australia’s interests in a rules-based global order. In line
with this objective, as of late June 2018, about 2,404 of
Australia’s approximately 57,800 force strength[34] are
deployed and are conducting operations overseas.
In Iraq, to support the airstrikes conducted by the


U.S. Forces against ISIL in northern Iraq, Australia began
air-dropping humanitarian supplies in August 2014 and
participating in combat missions such as airstrikes from
October 2014. In addition, Australia has been advising
and assisting, as well as providing capacity building
assistance to the Iraqi Security Forces on the military
front since May 2015. Since August 2014, in addition
to about 780 personnel (of which, approximately 400
personnel are engaged in assistance in the United Arab
Emirates), Australia has dispatched six F/A-18 fi ghter/
attack aircraft, one E-7A early warning and control
aircraft, and one KC-30A refueling aircraft, among other
assets, for activities in Iraq. Following the Declaration
of victory over ISIL by the Prime Minister of Iraq in
December 2017, that same month, Australia announced
that it would be halting air strikes.[35]

In Afghanistan, since October 2001, approximately
1,550 ADF personnel on average have engaged annually
in reconstruction assistance activities and the training of
the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), under the
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). With the
completion of ISAF’s activities in the end of 2014, about
300 ADF personnel now train, advise, and assist NATOled Afghan forces. In July 2016, Australia announced
that it would extend its support in the region until 2020
in order to solidify the progress that has been made in
Afghanistan to date.


33 Australia has extended proactive assistance for the political and social stability of Timor-Leste since 1999, when the momentum for independence heightened in Timor-Leste. The ADF led the
International Stabilization Force (ISF) since 2006, and with the stabilization of the security situation in Timor-Leste, the withdrawal of the ADF was completed in March 2013. In the Solomon Islands,
the ADF extended assistance for their stabilization since July 2003 through the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). The ADF withdrew from the country in August 2013, when
the military activities of RAMSI were completed.

34 According to “Military Balance (2018).” The breakdown by service is as follows: approx. 29,000 Army personnel; approx. 14,400 Navy personnel; and approx. 14,400 Air Force personnel.

35 Accordingly, the Australian Government withdrew six F/A-18 fi ghter jets back to Australia on January 2018. However, the E-7A early warning and control aircraft and refueling aircraft remain stationed

**Section 6 Southeast Asia**


1 General Situation


Southeast Asia occupies a strategic position for traffi c,
linking the Pacifi c and the Indian Oceans, such as the Straits
of Malacca and the South China Sea. It is an important
region for Japan which relies on maritime transport for
many of the supplies needed for economic activities and
the lives of the Japanese people. The countries in Southeast
Asia are making efforts to achieve political stability and
steady economic growth, and lately have realized overall
economic development to varying degrees. Such economic
development has deepened interdependence within the
region and with countries outside the region. In late 2015,
the establishment of the ASEAN Community was declared
as an outcome of the strides made in ASEAN cooperation
towards its integration.
Meanwhile, this region still has destabilizing factors,
including the territorial disputes over the South China
Sea, ethnic minority issues, separatist and independence
movements, and Islamic extremist groups. Moreover,
there are incidents such as piracy by which the safe

passage of ships is obstructed. Furthermore, there is a
concern about increases in terrorism in the region as the
activities of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)
in the Middle East slow down. In May 2017, an Islamist
extremist group pledging loyalty to ISIL took over a
town in the Philippines, and Malaysian and Indonesian
nationals are said to have joined this organization. In order
to cope with these issues, the countries in Southeast Asia
are working to build military forces for national defense
and maintenance of domestic public security, as well
as for addressing new security issues such as terrorism
and piracy. Recently, against the backdrop of economic
development, the countries have been modernizing
their military forces, mainly their naval and air forces,
as well as strengthening their maritime law enforcement
capacities.

capabilities—what it calls “Minimum Essential Force
(MEF).” However, Indonesia has indicated that its
maritime defense capabilities, in particular, are still
very much inadequate.[1] Accordingly, Indonesia has
announced a defense budget increase as well as a policy
to bolster its deployment of assets to the Natuna Islands
in the South China Sea and other locations.[2] Indonesia
is concerned that the “nine-dash line” claimed by China
overlaps with its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in
the vicinity of the Natuna Islands, and in July 2017,
Indonesia announced that it was changing the name of
the northern part of its EEZ in the South China Sea to the
“North Natuna Sea.” Indonesia emphasizes cooperation
with other Southeast Asian countries, and adopts an
independent and active foreign policy. With the United
States, it is strengthening its cooperative relationship
in such fi elds as military education and training and

Indonesia is a country of importance in Southeast Asia
with the world’s largest Muslim population, vast land and
territorial waters, and strategic importance for maritime
traffi c. Although Indonesia does not confront any immediate
external military threats, it faces internal concerns, including
the activities of Islamic extremists, such as supporters of ISIL
and Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), and secession and independence
movements in Papua Province.
Under the banner of the maritime nation concept,
President Joko Widodo who took offi ce in October 2014
strives to revive maritime culture, address territorial
disputes through maritime diplomacy, and strengthen
maritime defense capabilities.
As part of its military force reform, Indonesia
aims to meet the requirements for minimum defense


In July 2015, prior to his retirement, then Commander of the National Armed Forces of Indonesia Moeldoko said that Indonesia had achieved 34% of its MEF goals.

It is believed that on December 15, 2015, Minister of Defense Ryamizard Ryacudu unveiled a plan to deploy a fi ghter squadron and small vessels to the Natuna Islands as well as increase the
number of troops stationed there from the current 800 to around 2,000, including the special operations force of the Air Force, for the purpose of “being prepared for a range of threats such as illegal

part of fi scal reconsolidation efforts. This has resulted in the
announcement of the cancellation of a long-range railway
construction project, which had started with Chinese
cooperation in August 2017. The administration has
shown a stance of seeking renegotiations with the Chinese
Government on projects supported by China that were
actively advanced by the previous Najib administration.
As for North Korea, following the murder of Kim
Jong-nam at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in
February 2017, relations between the two countries have
deteriorated. However, Prime Minister Mahathir showed
his willingness to “establish a good relation” with North
Korea and said that Malaysia will reopen its embassy
in Pyongyang, which the previous administration had
considered to permanently close.

3 Myanmar


Myanmar shares borders with China and India, which
are steering the changing balance of power in the
international community, and is located on the border
of South Asia and Southeast Asia. In light of these
factors, Myanmar is noted for its strategic signifi cance.
In Myanmar, the armed forces had control over the
government following the collapse of the socialist regime
in 1988. However, with an economic slowdown caused
by the economic sanctions imposed by the West against
the military government, coupled with isolation from the
international community, transition to civilian rule based
on the road map to democracy was completed.[6] Later, in
the general elections in November 2015, the National
League for Democracy (NLD) led by President Aung San
Suu Kyi secured a victory, and in March 2016 the new
Htin Kyaw administration was started. Having relatives
who are foreign nationals, Aung San Suu Kyi is unable to
become president under the provisions of the constitution.
Therefore, she was appointed Foreign Minister and to the
newly created post of State Counsellor, and in these roles
she is exercising leadership in the administration.
Since the previous Thein Sein administration,
the Government of Myanmar has actively taken steps
towards democratization, including the release of
political prisoners and ceasefi re agreements with ethnic
minorities.[7] The international community has shown
some level of appreciation for these steps, with the West,


2 Malaysia


Malaysia, which is located at the center of Southeast
Asia, considers itself to have common strategic interests
with its neighboring countries. Although Malaysia
does not acknowledge any imminent external threats at
present, it believes that its forces should maintain a level
of readiness for dealing with all military threats, and
therefore, places importance on “Independence,” “Total
Defence,” “Commitment to the Rule of the Five Power
Defence Arrangements (FPDA),”[5] “Cooperation to the
UN for World Peace,” “Measures against Terrorism,” and
“Defence Diplomacy” in its defense policy. On the other
hand, in connection with the recent continued anchoring
of Chinese government vessels around the South
Luconia Shoal over which Malaysia claims sovereignty,
Malaysia has announced that its Navy and maritime
law enforcement agencies would conduct around-theclock monitoring, and that Malaysia would defend its
sovereignty. Along with these strengthening its maritime
defense force, Malaysia also has striven to bolster its
defense posture in eastern Malaysia, constructing a new
naval base in April 2017 in Bintulu close to the James
Shoal and the South Luconia Shoal.
Malaysia and the United States hold joint exercises
such as CARAT and SEACAT, and promote military
cooperation including capacity-building in the maritime
security fi eld.
Despite competing claims over the sovereignty of the
South China Sea and other matters, Malaysia and China
have strong ties, especially their economic relationship,
and mutual visits by dignitaries take place frequently. In
November 2016, Prime Minister Najib visited China and
reached an agreement on economic cooperation and the
purchase of naval vessels.
Furthermore, in November 2015, when the
Commander of the Chinese Navy visited Malaysia, it is
said that the two countries agreed on making use of the
Port of Kota Kinabalu for port calls by Chinese Navy
vessels. In January 2017, a Chinese submarine made a
port call at the Kota Kinabalu naval base for the very
fi rst time, and a second port call was made by a Chinese
submarine in September of that same year.
On the other hand, the new Mahathir administration
started in May 2018, has been pushing forward
reconsiderations of large-scale infrastructure projects as a


Entered into force in 1971. This agreement states that Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom will discuss what response should be adopted in the event of aggression towards or the threat
of an attack on Malaysia or Singapore. The fi ve countries carry out various exercises based on these arrangements.

Consists of seven steps: reconvening of the National Assembly; stepwise implementation of processes necessary for democratization; drafting a new constitution; a national referendum on the

About 30% of Myanmar’s population is ethnic minorities, some of which demand secession or greater autonomy for their regions. In the 1960s, the Government of Myanmar implemented oppressive


-----

With regard to individual foreign relations, China is
thought to be an important partner to Myanmar since its
period of military rule. With economic support from China,
a gas pipeline and a port, among other infrastructure,
are being built. On the military front, China is regarded
as a major supplier of equipment. In August 2016, State
Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi visited China, where she
announced the promotion of a comprehensive strategic
cooperative partnership. Furthermore, Myanmar has
maintained a cooperative relationship with Russia in the
military fi eld, including during the military regime, and
Russia has been a destination for students from Myanmar
and a supplier of major defense equipment. As for India,
since the transition to civilian rule, Myanmar has deepened
cooperative relations in the fi elds of the economy and
military, which has developed into defense cooperation
and exchanges such as the hosting of various seminars and
friendly visits to Myanmar by Indian naval vessels.
Cooperative relations with North Korea, including
weapons trades, were maintained under Myanmar’s
military regime. Following the transition to democracy,
although Myanmar denies that it has military ties to
North Korea, there are sometimes still reports suggesting
doubt about the relationship between the military and
North Korea.

[See] Part III, Chapter 2, Section 1-4-6 ((7) Myanmar)

4 The Philippines


The Philippines perceives that it confronts new security
challenges, including non-traditional threats, such as
transnational crime. At the same time, it identifi es that
long-standing issues, such as the territorial disputes
over the South China Sea and terrorism perpetrated by
domestic anti-government armed groups, constitute major
security concerns. President Duterte has announced his
policies that emphasize combating crime, illegal drugs
and corruption, fi ghting against Abu Sayyaf Group
(ASG), and forging peace in Mindanao since the time he
took offi ce in 2016.
As regards domestic security issues, over the last
approximately 40 years, armed confl icts have repeatedly
broken out between the Government of the Philippines
and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). With the
support of the activities of the International Monitoring
Team (IMT),[8] the peace process has made progress,
including the signing of the Comprehensive Agreement


Displaced people from Myanmar to Bangladesh
(©UNHCR/Andrew McConnell)

including the United States successively easing economic
sanctions on Myanmar.
With regard to the efforts for a ceasefi re agreement
with ethnic minorities, peace consultations with ethnic
military groups started from 2011. The Government
signed the Nationwide Ceasefi re Agreement with eight
armed ethnic minority groups in October 2015 and
with two more parties in February 2018 respectively.
Furthermore, in August 2016, the inaugural 21st Century
Panglong Union Peace Conference was held for peace
and reconciliation. This was followed by the second
Peace Conference in May 2017, and the third Peace
Conference in July 2018.
On the other hand, concerns are increasing in the
international community related to the situation in western
Rakhine State. Following attacks on police posts by the
Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) in August
2017, over 600,000 mostly Muslim refugees fl ed into
neighboring Bangladesh over the course of two months
since Myanmar military and other security forces launched
large-scale operations. The international community has
expressed concern over this incident on the grounds that
there were mass killings and violations of human rights.
With regard to this issue, Myanmar does not recognize that
the Muslims living in northern Rakhine State, so-called the
Rohingya people, as its citizens, and thus, their legal status
as stateless people complicates the issue.
In terms of foreign policy, Myanmar continues to
uphold a policy of neutrality and non-alignment, while
for its national defense policy, continues to emphasize
the three national causes of Non-disintegration of the
Union, Non-disintegration of National Solidarity, and
Perpetuation of Sovereignty, as well as resolutely repelling
foreign invasions and interference in domestic matters.

had launched a trilateral maritime patrol in the region of
the Sulu sea. Air patrols were also started by each country
in October of that year.
The Philippines, with a historically close relationship
with the United States, has maintained a cooperative
relationship with the United States under their mutual
defense treaty and military assistance agreement, even
after the withdrawal of the U.S. Forces in 1992.[11] The
two countries are conducting joint exercises including the
large-scale military exercise Balikatan.
In March 2016, the two countries agreed on fi ve
locations for carrying out defense cooperation under the
Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA)[12]
they signed in April 2014 for strengthening their
cooperation on such areas as the capacity enhancement of
the Armed Forces of the Philippines and disaster relief.[13]
It is expected that concrete steps will be taken, including
the development of facilities in the Philippines for the
rotational deployment of the U.S. Forces in accordance
with the EDCA.
The Philippines and China have competing claims
over the sovereignty of the Spratly Islands and the
Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. Seeking
a settlement under international law, in January 2013,
the Philippines launched arbitral tribunal proceedings
pursuant to UNCLOS against China. In July 2016, a
fi nal award was rendered accepting nearly all of the
Philippines’ submissions. The Government of the
Philippines released a statement that it welcomed the
award by the arbitral tribunal and strongly affi rms its
respect for the decision. Also, President Duterte stated in
his State of the Nation Address held in the same month
that the Philippines would strongly affi rm and uphold the
award handed down for the arbitration case between the
Philippines and China. However, when President Duterte
visited China in October 2016, a joint statement was
announced that included infrastructure investment, drug


on the Bangsamoro and the partial decommissioning of
MILF forces and weapons.[9] On the other hand, military
clashes have occurred between the government army and
National Police, and armed forces opposing the peace
talks.[10] It is deemed that time will be required to achieve
practical peace.
In May 2017, security forces clashed with the Maute
group, an Islamic extremist organization that pledges
allegiance to ISIL, which had occupied the city of
Marawi by taking hostages. The enduring battle resulted
in fatalities and injuries, causing public safety in the city
to deteriorate. As a result, martial law was declared in
Mindanao. The military operations resulted in the killing
of core members and fi ghters of the Maute group, leading
President Duterte to declare liberation of Marawi City
from terrorists in October of that same year. On the other
hand, the declaration of martial law was extended until the
end of 2018, to quell the continuing rebellion in the region.
ASG, an Islamic extremist group, has orchestrated
a number of kidnappings for ransom in the Sulu Sea
and Celebes Sea. Given this situation, in June 2017, the
Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia announced that they


9 In October 2012, the Framework Agreement for the realization of a fi nal agreement on the Mindanao peace process was signed. In January 2014, the Government of the Philippines and MILF
signed the Annex on Normalization. The goal of the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro signed in March 2014 was to launch an autonomous government in 2016 after formulating the
Bangsamoro Basic Law, holding a referendum in order to demarcate a jurisdictional domain, abolishing the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), and establishing the Bangsamoro
Transition Authority (BTA).

10 In January 2015, in Mindanao, an exchange of fi re occurred between the Philippine National Police that were mobilized to arrest JI suspects, and the MILF and Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters
(BIFF). This incident reportedly left casualties on both sides.

11 In 1947, a military base agreement was concluded that allows the U.S. Forces to use Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Station for 99 years. A military assistance agreement was also concluded in
1947, followed by the mutual defense treaty in 1951. With the revision of the 1966 military base agreement, the time limit for the stationing of U.S. military bases in the Philippines was set for 1991.
Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Station were returned in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Subsequently, the two countries concluded the Visiting Forces Agreement in 1998, establishing the legal
status of U.S. Forces personnel visiting for joint military exercises in the Philippines.

12 The EDCA is designed to enable the U.S. Forces to utilize and develop facilities in the Philippines, preposition equipment, among other activities. It was agreed that the bases in the Philippines to
be utilized by the U.S. Forces would be decided through consultations after the EDCA was concluded and would be stated in an annex to the agreement. After the signing in 2014, the consultations
regarding the annex had been suspended as litigation procedures were instituted in the Philippines on the grounds that the EDCA was unconstitutional. However, the Supreme Court of the Philippines
handed down a ruling in January 2016 that the EDCA is indeed constitutional.

13 At the 2+2 talks held on January 12, 2016 (EST), the ministers welcomed the decision that the EDCA was constitutional, and reaffi rmed their commitment to continue strengthening their alliance in
terms of ensuring both countries’ mutual defense and security as well as jointly contributing to regional peace, stability, and economic prosperity. On March 17-18, 2016 (EST), a strategic dialogue
among foreign and defense authorities was held in Washington, D.C. The two sides agreed on the following fi ve EDCA Agreed Locations: Antonio Bautista Air Base; Basa Air Base; Fort Magsaysay;

enforcement cooperation, coastal security cooperation
and military cooperation but did not make reference to
the tribunal’s award in the case involving the Philippines
and China. Also, in May 2017, President Duterte toured
a PLA Navy vessel that made its fi rst port call at the port
in Davao, where the president grew up, and announced
an agreement concerning joint military exercises with the
PLA. In this regard, attention will be paid to developments
in the future.

6 Thailand


Thailand’s defense policy includes: strengthening defense
cooperation through ASEAN, international organizations,
and other entities; defense that makes comprehensive
use of political, economic, and other national strengths;
and effective defense aimed at increasing the readiness
of the Royal Thai Armed Forces (RTAF) and developing
the defense industry. Attacks and bombing incidents by
Islamic extremists seeking secession and independence
have become a frequent occurrence in southern Thailand.
The Government identifi es the swift restoration of peace
and security of the lives and property of the people
in southern Thailand as an urgent task. In addition,
undemarcated border issues exist between Thailand and
neighboring countries including Myanmar and Cambodia.
The submission of an amnesty bill intended to pave the
way for the pardon and return of former Prime Minister
Thaksin Shinawatra by ruling parties to the National
Assembly in 2013 exacerbated domestic disorder. In May
2014, then Commander-in-Chief Prayuth Chan-o-Cha
of the Royal Thai Army issued a declaration of martial
law nationwide, and then seized power via the National
Council for Peace and Order, which mostly comprises
the Thai military. Currently, under the administration
led by former Commander-in-Chief Prayuth, who was
selected as interim Prime Minister, the Government
is aiming to hold general elections and transition to a
new administration under a new constitution in order
to facilitate a transition to civilian rule. The new
constitution was promulgated and entered into force in
April 2017. Next general election is expected to be held
in 2019.
Under its fl exible omni-directional diplomatic
policy, Thailand pursues cooperation with other Southeast
Asian countries and coordination with major countries,
including Japan, the United States, and China. Since the
conclusion of the Military Assistance Agreement in 1950,
Thailand and its ally, the United States,[17] have maintained
a cooperative relationship. They have conducted the
lateral joint exercise Cobra Gold since 1982, as well as


5 Singapore


Given its limited land area, population, and resources,
Singapore’s existence and development depend on the
peace and stability of the region in a globalized economy.
Singapore gives high priority to national defense, with
defense spending accounting for about one-fi fth of its
national budget.
Singapore identifi es deterrence and diplomacy as
twin pillars of its national defense policy. Because it is
a very small country, Singapore’s armed forces make
use of the training facilities of other countries, including
the United States and Australia, while continually
dispatching military personnel to take part in training
exercises overseas.
Singapore emphasizes the importance of cooperative
relations with ASEAN and the FPDA,[14] and has concluded
defense cooperation agreements with countries within
and outside the region. With the aim of contributing to
peace and stability in the region, Singapore supports U.S.
presence in the Asia-Pacifi c and permits it to use military
facilities in Singapore. In 2013, U.S. littoral combat
ships (LCSs) began their rotational deployments.[15]
In December 2015, the P-8 patrol aircraft of the U.S.
Forces were deployed to Singapore for around one week
for the fi rst time. The two countries have committed to
continuing to carry out similar deployments routinely.[16]
In addition, Singapore conducted joint exercises with the
United States, such as CARAT and SEACAT.
As for China, in May 2015, the two countries
conducted their fi rst bilateral naval joint exercise ChinaSingapore Cooperation 2015. Active mutual visits by
dignitaries have also taken place, with President Xi

Vietnam perceives that it confronts diverse and complex
security challenges. It considers that the issues in the
South China Sea have serious impacts on the maritime
activities of Vietnam, and non-traditional threats, such as
piracy and terrorism, are matters of concern.
During the Cold War era, the former Soviet Union
provided the most signifi cant assistance to Vietnam. Until
2002, Russia had a naval base in Cam Ranh Bay. After
the collapse of the former Soviet Union, Vietnam rapidly
expanded its diplomatic relations with other countries,
including establishing diplomatic ties with the United
States. At present, Vietnam pursues an omnidirectional
diplomatic policy and seeks to actively participate in
international and regional cooperation in order to build
friendly relations with all countries. In March 2016, an
international port opened in the key strategic position of
Cam Ranh Bay, and since then a number of navy vessels
from not only Japan but also the United States and China
have made calls to the new port.
In January 2016, the Congress of the Communist
Party of Vietnam (CPV) was held after fi ve years since the
previous Congress.[20] The Congress decided that Nguyen
Phu Trong would remain CPV General Secretary, among
other decisions, and a new leadership was established.
General Secretary Trong in his second term identifi ed
that his focal missions for the next fi ve years would
include the following: enhance party building; carry out
political reform; accelerate national modernization; and
maintain the country’s independence, sovereignty, unity,
and territorial integrity.
Vietnam and the United States have strengthened
their military relations in recent years. This has taken
such forms as joint exercises with the U.S. Navy and port
calls by U.S. Navy vessels in Vietnam. In 2017, mutual


visits were conducted by the leaders of both countries,
and an agreement was reached on the deepening of
defense cooperation. March 2018 marked the fi rst port
call by a U.S. aircraft carrier to Vietnam since the end of
the Vietnam war.
Vietnam and Russia continue to strengthen
cooperation in the area of national defense. In March
2013, Minister of Defence Sergey Shoygu visited
Vietnam, and the two sides agreed to jointly construct
vessel replenishment facilities along Cam Ranh Bay. In
2014, Russian IL-78 aerial refueling tankers landed at
Cam Ranh International Airport for the fi rst time for the
refueling fl ights for Russia’s Tu-95MS strategic bombers.[21]
As these examples demonstrate, the two countries have
been carrying out new military cooperation. In recent
years, the two countries have also promoted cooperation
in the energy sector, such as nuclear power generation.
Vietnam is mostly on Russia for its defense equipment.

[See] Chapter 2, Section 4-5-2 (Relations with Asian Countries)

[See]

Vietnam and China, under their comprehensive
strategic cooperation partnership relations, proactively
conduct exchanges among their senior government
offi cials. However, the two countries have competing
claims concerning issues such as sovereignty over
the South China Sea. In November 2015, President Xi
Jinping visited Vietnam, and the two sides agreed that
differences in opinion regarding maritime issues would
be dealt with appropriately. They also signed a joint
statement noting that the two countries would refrain from
actions that further complicate the issue. Furthermore,
in January 2017, General Secretary of the Communist
Party of Vietnam Trong visited China, where the bilateral
agreements of past summit meetings, including the basic
principles concerning the South China Sea fi nalized in
2010, were reaffi rmed and it was agreed that they would
advance cooperation aimed at joint development.
Vietnam and India have been deepening their
cooperative relationship in a broad range of areas,
including security and economy. In the area of defense
cooperation, it is noted that the Indian Armed Forces
support the training of Vietnam’s Navy submarine
personnel and Air Force pilots, and Indian Navy vessels
make friendly visits to Vietnam. Furthermore, when then


18 In May 2014, following the coup d’état in Thailand, the United States announced it would suspend joint exercises and freeze military assistance. However, the lateral joint exercise Cobra Gold was
held in February 2015, and the bilateral joint exercise CARAT was held in August 2015.

19 From November 12 to 30, 2015, the fi rst joint exercise between Chinese and Thai air forces, Falcon Strike-2015, was held at the Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base in Thailand. From China, six J-11B
fi ghters participated, and from Thailand, fi ve JAS-39 Gripen fi ghters participated. In addition, in the air show of the closing ceremony of the exercise, from China, seven J-10 fi ghters of the August
1st Aerobatics Team participated, and from Thailand, two F-16 fi ghters participated.

20 President Truong Tan Sang, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung, Minister of National Defence Phung Quang Thanh, among others were not reelected and retired from offi ce. In April 2016, President Tran
Dai Quang, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, Minister of National Defense Ngo Xuan Lich, and others were appointed at the Vietnamese National Assembly.

21 In March 2015, it was reported that U.S. DoD authorities, while stating the relevant facts, requested Vietnam to prevent the recurrence of this activity. In addition, a senior offi cial of the U.S. Pacifi c
Command allegedly stated that the Russian military aircraft that received refueling from the aerial refueling tankers arriving from the Cam Ranh base conducted provocative fl ights. In January 2015,

the fi rst Indian prime minister to visit Vietnam in 15 years.
During the visit an agreement was reached on raising
the status of the bilateral relationship to comprehensive
strategic partnership, while an announcement was made

3 Military Modernization in the Region


concerning a loan of US$500 million for deepening
defense cooperation. Cooperation in the area of energy
between India and Vietnam is also deepening, with a joint
development program for oil and natural gas in the South
China Sea.

jets from Russia. In addition, that same year, Malaysia
introduced two Scorpène-class submarines (jointly
developed by France and Spain) as its fi rst submarines.
In November 2014, Malaysia reportedly concluded
an agreement to purchase six corvettes from the ROK.
Malaysia announced a plan to build six indigenous
littoral combat ships (LCSs). The fi rst of these vessels
was launched in August 2017. Furthermore, in November
2016, Malaysia concluded an agreement with China to
purchase four littoral mission ships (LMS).
The Philippines has taken steps in recent years to
modernize its defense equipment against the backdrop of
confl icts over territorial rights in the South China Sea.
After the F-5 fi ghters were decommissioned in 2005,
the Philippines did not have any fi ghters for some length
of time. However, between November 2015 and May
2017, the Philippines successively introduced 12 FA50PH light fi ghters purchased from the ROK.
As for naval forces, the Philippines received three
Hamilton-class frigates from the United States by 2016.
The Philippines introduced two Indonesian-made landing
dock vessels by 2017.
Singapore is actively striving to modernize its forces.
It introduced 24 U.S.-made F-15 fi ghters by 2012
and also participates in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter
(JSF) Program.
As for naval forces, Singapore introduced two
Archerclass (Västergötland-class) submarines from
Sweden by 2012. Also, in December 2013, Singapore
concluded an agreement to purchase two German
218SG-class submarines (with plans to introduce them
from 2021). With regard to Singapore’s current plans to
build eight indigenous patrol vessels, the fi rst such vessel
came into service in May 2017, and the country aims to
have all vessels in operation by 2020.


In recent years, Southeast Asian countries have increased
their defense spending against the backdrop of economic
development and other reasons, and are modernizing their
military forces focusing on inducting equipment such
as submarines and fi ghters including fourth-generation
modern fi ghters. The underlying factors noted are
increases in defense spending, the relationship between
Southeast Asian countries in the sense that they react to
neighboring states’ development of military capabilities,
response to the expansion of China’s infl uence, and the
inadequate role of regional security organizations to
nurture relationships of trust.[23] Many Southeast Asian
countries procure much of their defense equipment from
a wide range of countries. As such, there are perceived
diffi culties in achieving consistent operations and
maintenance in the respective countries.
Indonesia has introduced a total of 16 Russian
Su-27 fi ghters and Su-30 fi ghters by 2013. In 2011, an
agreement was reached regarding the U.S. provision of 24
F-16 fi ghters, and these have been successively delivered
since July 2014. In addition, in August 2017, Indonesia
announced plans for an additional procurement of 11
Su-35 fi ghters from Russia. With the ROK, Indonesia
concluded an agreement in December 2011 to purchase
three ROK-made 209-class submarines, and one was
delivered on August 2017. The two countries also
discussed joint development of the 4.5 generation KF-X/
IF-X fi ghter, and they concluded an agreement which
sets forth the details of their cost sharing and bilateral
cooperation in January 2016. In addition, Indonesia is
domestically building two frigates based on the Dutch
Sigma-class Frigate 10514 vessel. The fi rst of these
vessels was delivered in January 2017, and the second
was delivered January 2018.
As of 2009, Malaysia had purchased 18 Su-30 fi ghter


22 The statement was agreed upon in May 2015, when Minister of National Defense Phung Quang Thanh of Vietnam visited India and held talks with Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar. While the content
of the Joint Vision Statement has not been disclosed, it is said to cover the period 2015-2020, with maritime security cooperation constituting the main pillar. On the same day, the two sides also
signed an MOU on strengthening the cooperation between their coast guards.


-----

As for Thailand, in July 2014, the country established
the Submarine Squadron Headquarters, and started
evaluation work to procure submarines. In April 2017, the
Royal Thai Navy drew up a plan to purchase three Yuanclass submarines from China over the next 11 years, and
the Thai Cabinet approved the purchase of one vessel.[24]
With regard to frigates, in September 2012, the Cabinet
approved a plan to introduce two frigates, and concluded
an agreement to purchase an ROK-made frigate as the


fi rst one. In addition, by 2013, Thailand has introduced
12 Swedish-made JAS-39 Gripen fi ghters.
By January 2017, Vietnam successively introduced
six Russian-made Kilo-class submarines. By February
2018, Vietnam started the operation of four Russian-made
Gepard-class frigates. As for its air force capabilities,
Vietnam started to successively introduce Russian-made
Su-30 fi ghters in 2004, and to date, the total number of
delivered Su-30 fi ghters came to 36.


4 Trends concerning Sovereignty and Other Issues over the South China Sea


permission from the relevant departments under China’s
State Council. In January 2016, China set out a maritime
policy for the next fi ve years beginning from 2016,
which stated that China would build a “Spratly Islands
ecosystem protection zone.”
On the other hand, ASEAN countries as well have
been bolstering their claims to territory in the South China
Sea. In March 2009, the Philippines passed the so-called
Archipelagic Baselines Law, stating that the Philippines
has sovereignty over part of the Spratly Islands and the
Scarborough Shoal pursuant to UNCLOS.[28] In May
2009, Vietnam and Malaysia jointly requested to the
Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf
(CLCS) an extension of the continental shelf of the sea
area that includes part of the Spratly Islands.[29] In June
2012, Vietnam adopted the Maritime Law (effective
January 2013) that asserts its sovereignty over the Spratly
and Paracel Islands.
Some of the countries concerned in the South China
Sea have reportedly resorted to the use of force on the
opposing country’s vessels, including seizing vessels and
fi ring warning shots, and the concerned countries have
mutually lodged protests against these actions.
Between Vietnam and China, in May 2014, China’s
unilateral commencement of oil drilling in waters near
the Paracel Islands triggered confrontations between
Chinese and Vietnamese vessels. In July 2015, a
Vietnamese fi shing vessel was rammed by a Chinese


1 Background

In the South China Sea, ASEAN countries and China have
competing claims to such areas as the Spratly Islands[25]
and the Paracel Islands.[26] China is pursuing unilateral,
large-scale, and rapid land reclamation and the building
of facilities. The international community is expressing
deep concern over the unilateral changes in the status quo
and China’s creation of a fait accompli.
Since the enactment of the Act on the Territorial
Sea and the Contiguous Zone of the People’s Republic
of China in 1992, which stated that the Spratly Islands
and the Paracel Islands are the territories of China,
the country has only strengthened moves intended to
emphasize its territorial claims. For example, China
attached a map of the “nine-dash line”[27] to a verbal note
addressed to the UN in 2009, in which it made claims
to the parts of the South China Sea that purportedly
came under China’s “sovereignty, sovereign rights, and
jurisdiction.” Furthermore, in 2012, China announced the
establishment of Sansha City in Hainan Province, which
claims to have jurisdiction over the islands of the Spratly
Islands, the Paracel Islands, the Macclesfi eld Bank, and
their surrounding waters. In November 2013, Hainan
Province amended its regulation on the implementation
of China’s fi shing law, stipulating that foreign fi shing
vessels that wish to carry out fi shing activities in waters
under the jurisdiction of Hainan Province must obtain


24 The plan to purchase Chinese-made submarines for the Royal Thai Navy approved by Thailand’s cabinet on April 18, 2017 fi rst calls for purchasing one vessel in installments appropriated over the
budgets from 2017 to 2023, and then procuring a total of three vessels over the next 11-year period. On May 5, a contract was concluded on the purchase of one of these three submarines.

25 The area surrounding the Spratly Islands is expected to have offshore resources such as oil and natural gas. The area is also a maritime transport hub and is blessed with rich fi shery resources.

26 China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Brunei claim sovereignty over the Spratly Islands. China, Taiwan, and Vietnam claim sovereignty over the Paracel Islands.

27 Concerning the “nine-dash line,” although this has given rise to confl icting claims about territory in the South China Sea among Southeast Asian countries, China has not offered any concrete
explanations regarding the relationship between the “nine-dash line” and relevant international norms.

28 According to the Republic Act No. 9522. This law gives the location of the baselines of the archipelago in terms of latitude and longitude, including of Luzon Island, Palawan Island, and Mindanao
Island. However, for the Spratly Islands (Filipino name: Calayan Islands) and the Scarborough Shoal (Filipino name: Bajo de Masinloc), the law states that the baseline is based on the “Regime of
Islands” under Article 121 of UNCLOS and does not give the geographical location of the baseline.

29 The Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) is a body established under UNCLOS (Article 76 and Article 1 of Annex II). Coastal states (signatories) submit information concerning the
continental shelf to CLCS when establishing the outer limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles, and then CLCS issues a recommendation based on scientifi c and technical guidelines.
The limits of the continental shelf based on the CLCS recommendation is fi nal and binding for coastal states. CLCS consists of 21 members serving a term of fi ve years. Members must be experts in

vessel and sunk near the Paracel Islands.[30] In May 2016, a
high-speed Chinese vessel followed a Vietnamese fi shing
boat and intimidated it with its guns near Cuarteron
Reef in the Spratly Islands. Furthermore, in January
of the same year, a dispute occurred over oil resource
development in which Vietnam, alleging that China’s oil
drilling rig “Haiyang Shiyou 981” conducted activities
in an area north of the Paracel Islands where Vietnam
and China have overlapping claims to the continental
shelf, requested[31] China to suspend its operations and
withdraw the rig.
Between China and the Philippines, in November
2015, a Chinese vessel allegedly appeared several
kilometers off the coast of Thitu Island of the Spratly
Islands, an island occupied by the Philippines, and
anchored there for approximately ten days.[32] In April 2017,
Secretary of National Defense Lorenzana indicated his
intention to protest to China through diplomatic channels
concerning an incident that occurred in March 2017 in
waters near the Spratly Islands when China Coast Guard
vessels fi red warning shots across the bows of Filipino
fi shing vessels. Furthermore, the Secretary landed on
Thitu Island, effectively controlled by the Philippines, in
a military aircraft where he stated his intention to push
forward with repairs of the runway.
Between Malaysia and China, in March of that year,
in an incident occurred in which it is said that China
Coast Guard vessels and around 100 Chinese fi shing
boats together made an incursion into the area around the
Luconia Shoals within Malaysia’s EEZ.
Between Vietnam and Taiwan as well, in January
2016, a Vietnamese fi shing vessel operating near the
Spratly Islands reportedly collided with a Taiwanese
coast guard vessel.
Some of the countries concerned in the South
China Sea conduct land reclamations and build facilities
on the features they respectively occupy, including the
Spratly Islands. However, under these circumstances,
since 2014, China has pushed forward with rapid and
large-scale land reclamation activities and continued


to install military facilities such as batteries, as well
as develop various types of infrastructure that can be
used for military purposes, including runways, hangars,
harbors and radar, continuing to make the features
military bases.

2 Recent Developments


Some countries with claims on territory in the South China
Sea are making efforts to resolve the issue peacefully in
accordance with international law. In January 2013, the
Philippines instituted arbitral proceedings pursuant to
UNCLOS for the dispute over China’s assertions and
actions in the South China Sea, and in July 2016, an
arbitral tribunal rendered a fi nal ruling in which it ruled
in favor of nearly all of the Philippines’ submissions.[33] In
response, China issued a statement noting that the ruling
was invalid and had no binding force and that China
opposed and refused to accept it. Pursuant to UNCLOS
provisions, the award of the arbitral tribunal is fi nal and is
legally binding on the parties to the dispute, and therefore,
it is necessary that the parties adhere to the award.
As for ASEAN, the issues surrounding the South
China Sea have been discussed repeatedly at ASEANrelated meetings and other fora, with a view to achieving
their peaceful resolution. A Chairman’s Statement from
an ASEAN Summit in May 2014 repeated concerns over
the situation in the South China Sea. Following that,
the Chairman’s Statement from the November 2017
ASEAN Summit did not express such concerns, but
instead drew attention to the recognition that Chinese and
ASEAN relations were improving. However, within the
Chairman’s Statement from the ASEAN Summit held
in April 2018, yet again concerns were expressed by a
portion of the leaders about land reclamation activity in
the South China Sea.
Also, in 2002, ASEAN and China signed the
Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China


30 Incidents involving the collision and sinking of Vietnamese fi shing vessels by Chinese vessels near the Paracel Islands are believed to have taken place in September 2015, January, March, and July
2016, August 2017, and April 2018.

31 According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Vietnam, on January 16, 2016, China’s oil rig “Haiyang Shiyou 981” was found 21.4 nautical miles east of the assumed median line where the
Vietnamese and Chinese continental shelves overlap. It is believed that notices were sent to China about this matter on January 18. It is reported that a similar incident occurred in April of that
same year.

32 Thitu Island (Filipino name: Pag-asa Island) is a feature located near Subi Reef where China is building a runway. The mayor with jurisdiction over the island spotted the China Coast Guard vessel. This
was reportedly the fi rst time that a vessel anchored for as long as ten days.

33 With regard to the “nine-dash line” and China’s claim to historic rights, the arbitral tribunal found that China’s claims to historic rights with respect to the maritime areas encompassed by the “ninedash line” are contrary to UNCLOS and without lawful effect to the extent that they exceed the limits of China’s maritime entitlements under UNCLOS. With regard to the legal status of features, the
arbitral tribunal found that all of the features in Scarborough Shoal and the Spratly Islands (including Itu Aba Island [Taiwanese name: Taiping Dao]) have no EEZ or continental shelf. With regard to the
legality of Chinese activities, the tribunal found that China has unlawfully prevented Filipino fi shermen from engaging in traditional fi shing at Scarborough Shoal, violated its obligations to protect the
marine environment through its largescale land reclamations, artifi cial island-building, and other activities, violated its obligations pertaining to navigation safety by virtue of the dangerous navigation
by its law enforcement vessels, breached the Philippines’ sovereign rights through its land reclamations at Mischief Reef, and violated its obligations by aggravating and extending the disputes through

being made in discussions should be appreciated, care
must be taken to ensure that COC does not invalidate the
decision of the arbitral tribunal between the Philippines
and China, or is not used as a pretext for excluding the
involvement of countries outside the region.
The issues surrounding the South China Sea are a
matter of concern for the whole international community,
and are directly related to the peace and stability of the
Asia-Pacifi c region. As such, attention will continue to be
paid to trends in the countries concerned, as well as the
direction of dialogues aimed at the resolution of the issues.

ASEAN attaches importance to expanding its relations
with countries outside of the region. It holds the ASEAN

1 General Situation


With a population of more than 1.2 billion on its vast
land, India is the world’s largest democratic country. It
has achieved steady economic growth in recent years, and
has signifi cant infl uence in the South Asian region. Also,
it is located in the middle of the Indian Ocean, which is of
strategic and geopolitical importance in terms of sea lines
of communication, connecting the Asia-Pacifi c region
with the Middle East and Europe.
India shares borders with many countries, and has
non-demarcated border issues with China and Pakistan.
India has multiple ethnic groups, religions, cultures, and
languages,[1] and there are concerns about the activities of
ultra-leftists and secession and independence movements,
as well as the movements of Islamic extremists stationed
across the India-Pakistan border.
On the diplomatic front, the Modi administration
that was inaugurated in May 2014 has maintained
the neighborhood fi rst policy, which emphasizes
strengthening relations with South Asian countries, while
expanding the focus of strengthening India’s external
relations to the Asia-Pacifi c region, in accordance with
the “Act East” policy.[2] In addition, the administration has
carried out proactive foreign policy, placing priority also
on India’s relations with the United States, Russia, Europe,
among other areas. In the defense domain, maintaining
preparedness at its land borders and addressing the threat
of terrorism remain major concerns. At the same time,
the administration has also recently attached importance
to ensuring maritime security, especially in the Indian
Ocean. Furthermore, the administration has made efforts
aimed at modernizing its military by expanding foreign
companies’ direct investment in India’s defense industry


under the “Make in India” initiative and promoting the
domestic production of equipment through enhancing
technological cooperation with other countries. Moreover,
the administration has deepened collaboration with other
countries to strengthen maritime security cooperation.


2 Military Affairs


India’s security environment is directly linked to its
neighboring countries and the regions of West Asia,
Central Asia, Southeast Asia, East Asia, and the Indian
Ocean; and India recognizes that strategic-economic
factors impose upon them an increasingly larger
responsibility. In view of the multifaceted security
concerns and the global dimensions of the challenges,
India has strengthened cooperative relations with other
countries and has long been actively participating in
UN PKOs. In order to respond rapidly and effectively to
diversifi ed security issues, the Government and defense
forces remain fully prepared to tackle all challenges.
Based on the nuclear doctrine of 2003, India
adheres to the following policies: minimum nuclear
deterrence, the no-fi rst-use nuclear policy, no use against
non-nuclear weapon nations, and maintaining the
unilateral moratorium on nuclear tests that it announced
immediately after the nuclear test in 1998. India promotes
the development and deployment of various ballistic
missiles. India conducted the sixth test launch of “Agni
5” in June 2018 and reportedly started developing “Agni
6,” which is alleged to have a range of up to 10,000
km. It is deemed that the country aspires to extend the
ranges of ballistic missiles and make other performance
improvements. In regard to cruise missiles, India jointly
develops “BrahMos” with Russia and deploys them. India


The country has a Muslim population exceeding 100 million, although the majority of the country’s population is Hindu.

It is regarded that based on the progress of the “Look East” policy intended to strengthen India’s relations with ASEAN, the “Act East” policy which advocates a more practical approach has been

is also developing a ballistic missile defense system.[3]

In recent years, India has been injecting efforts
into modernizing its naval and air forces in particular.
As a part of these efforts, it is expanding procurement
of equipment from foreign countries as well as joint
development with them, and has emerged as the world’s
largest arms importer.[4]

With respect to its naval capabilities, India
decommissioned one aging British-built aircraft carrier INS
Viraat in March 2017. India introduced the Russian-built
conventional powered aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya
in November 2013, and is also building one indigenous
conventional powered aircraft carrier INS Vikrant.[5]
With regard to submarines, India acquired one Russianbuilt Akula-class nuclear-powered attack submarine
INS Chakra in April 2012 under a lease arrangement. It
reportedly placed into service its fi rst indigenous ballistic
missile and nuclear submarine INS Arihant in August
2016. Furthermore, in 2009, India concluded an agreement
with the United States to purchase eight P-8I patrol aircraft.
India has so far deployed all eight aircraft to a base in
southern India facing the Bay of Bengal, and in July 2016
it concluded a purchase agreement for an additional four
P-8I patrol aircraft.
With respect to its air force capabilities, India is
refurbishing its existing fi ghter aircraft. Moreover, it
signed an agreement to purchase 36 Rafale fi ghter aircraft
from France in September 2016 as part of India’s plan to
induct medium multi-role combat aircraft (MMRCA).[6]
With Russia, India has concluded an agreement in
December 2012 to purchase 42 additional Su-30 fi ghters.
India has also been deepening military technological
cooperation with Russia, including the joint development
of the Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft based on the PAK


FA being developed by Russia. With the United States,
India has concluded an agreement in 2010 to purchase
ten C-17 transport aircraft and has inducted all of these
aircraft by 2014.
In addition to aircraft carriers and nuclear
submarines, India undertakes the development and
indigenous production of tanks and light combat aircraft.
However, delays in their development present challenges
for India’s domestic production of equipment.

**(1) Relations with Pakistan**
India and Pakistan have disputes over the sovereignty
of Kashmir,[7] and have had three armed confl icts of
signifi cant scope. The territorial dispute over Kashmir
has long been in contention between India and Pakistan,

Regarding missiles that India possessed, the following have been indicated:
“Prithvi 2”: a mobile, single-stage liquid-fuelled ballistic missile with a range of about 250-350 km
“Agni 1”: a mobile, single-stage solid-fuelled ballistic missile with a range of about 700-1,250 km
“Agni 2”: a mobile, two-stage solid-fuelled ballistic missile with a range of about 2,000-3,500 km

“BrahMos”: a solid/Ramjet supersonic cruise missile with a range of about 300-500 km
Ballistic missile defense system: India is developing a two-stage intercept system consisting of a missile for high altitude interception (PAD) up to 80 km in altitude and a missile for low altitude
interception (AAD) up to 30 km in altitude

According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI)

The indigenous aircraft carrier INS Vikrant is 262.5 m long, has a standard displacement of 40,642 t, and is scheduled to be commissioned in 2018.

Since 2007, India has been implementing a project to induct 126 MMRCA. In 2012, India announced that it selected the French Rafale aircraft. In April 2015, during his visit to France, Prime Minister
Modi expressed India’s intention to swiftly purchase 36 Rafale aircraft. It is believed that a purchase agreement was signed in September 2016 and discussions are still ongoing regarding the model
of the remaining 90 aircraft.

India asserts the accession of Kashmir to India, based on the Instrument of Accession document by which the ruler of Kashmir acceded to India at the time of Pakistan’s independence, and contends
that this matter should be resolved through bilateral negotiations on the basis of the 1972 Simla Agreement (an agreement on the peaceful resolution of disputes and the withdrawal of their military
forces that was reached following a summit meeting held in Simla in northern India). On the other hand, Pakistan declares that this should be decided through a referendum, in line with a 1948 UN

with dialogues repeatedly resuming and suspending.[8]
More recently, then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
of Pakistan was invited to Prime Minister Modi’s
swearing-in ceremony in May 2014. In December 2015,
on his return from visiting Afghanistan, Prime Minister
Modi made a surprise informal visit to Pakistan. In this
regard, both countries have demonstrated readiness to
improve their relations. Meanwhile, it remains uncertain
whether bilateral dialogues would be sustained, with the
postponement of their vice foreign ministerial meeting
in both August 2014 and January 2016.[9] Armed clashes
between the two militaries have repeatedly taken place
in the Kashmir region. The large-scale armed clashes
in October 2014 reportedly killed and injured civilians.
Furthermore, in January 2016, armed forces intruded
into an Indian Air Force base adjacent to the Kashmir
area, killing and wounding security personnel and others,
and also in September 2016, armed insurgents attacked
an Indian military base on the Indian side of Kashmir,
reportedly killing and injuring a number of troops. In
the same month, the Indian Army announced that India’s
military crossed the Kashmir Line of Control to carry
out a localized attack on a terrorist camp located on the
Pakistani side. In this manner, the Kashmir issue remains
a concern for both countries.

**(2) Relations with the United States**
India is actively striving to strengthen bilateral relations
with the United States. The United States is also promoting
engagement with India in line with the expansion of
the relationship derived from the economic growth of
India. The two countries conduct joint exercises, such
as Malabar,[10] on a regular basis. In addition, in recent
years, the United States has become one of India’s major
equipment procurement destinations.[11]
At the Summit Meeting in January 2015, two leaders


agreed that they would expand technology cooperation
to include co-development and co-production of
equipment. The leaders also affi rmed that they would
deepen cooperation in the fi eld of maritime security,
and agreed that cooperation between their navies
would be expanded, including upgrading their bilateral
naval exercise Malabar. Furthermore, at the Defense
Ministerial Meeting in December 2015, the two sides
held talks on strengthening various defense cooperation,
and confi rmed the progress made in the technology
cooperation consultations related to aircraft carriers
and jet engines conducted by their joint working group.
In such ways, their cooperation in the fi eld of security
has expanded. In addition, when Prime Minister Modi
visited the United States in June 2016, the United States
recognized that India is a “Major Defense Partner.” In
August 2016, in a joint statement of the U.S. and Indian
defense ministers, the United States agreed to elevate
defense trade and technology sharing with India to a
level commensurate with its closest allies and partners.
Also, a memorandum was signed concerning logistics
support cooperation.
In June 2017, Prime Minister Modi visited the United
States. At his fi rst summit meeting with President Trump,
the two sides agreed to continue to strengthen their strategic
partnership. In the area of security, they underscored the
importance of Malabar, and furthermore, the United States
proposed the sale of unmanned aerial systems.

**(3) Relations with China**

[See] Chapter 2, Section 3-3-5 ((3) Relations with South Asian

Countries)


**(4) Relations with Russia**

[See] Chapter 2, Section 4-5-2 (Relations with Asian Countries)


8 Dialogue between the two countries was suspended due to the Mumbai terror attack in 2008, but it resumed following the February 2011 talks by their Vice-Ministers of Foreign Affairs. In 2011, both
countries affi rmed the importance of peacefully settling all outstanding issues between the two countries through dialogue. Pakistan then decided to grant India most-favored nation status.

9 In December 2014, Minister of State for External Affairs Vijay Kumar Singh attributed the postponement of the meeting in August that year to the meeting between Pakistan’s High Commissioner and
Kashmiri leaders of organizations which seek Kashmir’s secession from India. The meeting was ultimately held in March 2015. It is suggested that the meeting in January 2016 was postponed due
to the attack on the Indian Air Force base that occurred in the same month.

10 The Malabar was initially a bilateral naval exercise between the United States and India. Then, Japan, Australia, and Singapore joined Malabar 07-2, and Japan participated in Malabar 09, Malabar
14, Malabar 15, and Malabar 16.

2 Pakistan


1 General Situation

Wedged between the powerful South Asian nation of
India and politically-unstable Afghanistan, and sharing
borders with China and Iran, Pakistan is placed in a
geopolitically signifi cant and complex position. In
particular, Islamic extremists conduct activities across
the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, and Pakistan’s attitude
towards the war against terrorism draws much attention
from the international community.
While supporting the United States’ war against
terrorism in Afghanistan, the Government of Pakistan
has been struggling as its domestic security situation
has worsened, with issues such as growing anti-U.S.
sentiment and retaliatory terrorism by Islamic extremists.
Although then Prime Minister Sharif conducted peace
consultations maintaining a policy of dialogue with
armed forces, in June 2014, the Pakistan Armed Forces
also launched a military operation against these forces.
Following a school attack in Peshawar in the same
year, upon revising the Constitution, Pakistan developed
the National Action Plan that includes establishing a
special military tribunal to try terrorist suspects, and
announced that the Armed Forces would continue with
and step up its mop-up operation. Subsequently, it
appears that terrorist attacks have decreased considerably.
However, for example, in January 2016, an attack
targeting a university in Charsadda in northeast Peshawar
occurred, killing and injuring many students and others,
and terrorist attacks have continued to occur sporadically
since then.


2 Military Affairs

Pakistan takes the position that maintaining nuclear
deterrence against the nuclear threat posed by India is
essential to ensure national security and self-defense.
In the past, the so-called Khan network was involved
in the proliferation of nuclear-related materials and
technologies.[12]

Pakistan has been actively proceeding with the
development of ballistic missiles and cruise missiles
capable of carrying nuclear warheads, and has conducted
a number of test launches in recent years. In 2015,
Pakistan conducted two test launches of the ballistic
missile “Shaheen 3” in March and December, and a test
launch from an aircraft of the cruise missile “Raad” in
January 2016. Pakistan also conducted its fi rst test launch
of the ballistic missile “Ababeel,” which is capable of
delivering multiple warheads, using Multiple Independent
Re-entry Vehicle (MIRV) technology, in January 2017.
Same as the previous year, it conducted another test fi re
of submarine launched cruise missile “Babur” in March
2018. It is deemed that Pakistan is steadily increasing
military capabilities of its missiles.[13]

Pakistan is the world’s ninth largest importer of
weapons, and it is pointed out that 70% of its weapons are
imported from China.[14] Pakistan purchased four Swordclass frigates from China, while at the same time it has
engaged in the joint development of the JF-17 fi ghter
aircraft with China and has inducted 69 aircraft through
indigenous production. Pakistan is also considered to
have recently conducted negotiations with China to
newly purchase four frigates and eight submarines.
Although Pakistan introduced 18 F-16C/D fi ghter jets
received from the United States by 2011, due to the recent
degradation of the Pakistan-U.S. relationship, it has been
pointed out[15] that weapon imports into Pakistan seem to
be on the decline.


12 Pakistan is believed to have started its nuclear program in the 1970s and conducted its fi rst nuclear test near the Changai District of the Balochistan Province in 1998. In 2004, it came to
light that nuclear-related technologies, including uranium enrichment technology, had been transferred to North Korea, Iran, and Libya by Dr. Khan and other scientists, who had led the nuclear
program in Pakistan.

13 Regarding missiles that Pakistan possessed, the following have been indicated:
“Nasr” (Hatf 9): a mobile, single-stage solid-fuelled ballistic missile with a range of about 70 km
“Ghaznavi” (Hatf 3): a mobile, single-stage solid-fuelled ballistic missile with a range of about 290 km
“Shaheen 1” (Hatf 4): a mobile, single-stage solid-fuelled ballistic missile with a range of about 750 km
“Ghauri” (Hatf 5): a mobile, single-stage liquid-fuelled ballistic missile with a range of about 1,300-1,800 km
“Shaheen 3” (Hatf 6): a mobile, two-stage solid-fuelled ballistic missile with a range of about 2,750 km
“Ababeel”: a new ballistic missile with a range of about 2,200 km
“Raad” (Hatf 8): a cruise missile with a range of about 350 km
“Babur” (Hatf 7): a supersonic cruise missile with a range of about 750 km

14 According to SIPRI.


-----

Meanwhile, Pakistan urges the United States to
immediately end its drone attacks on Islamic extremists
in Pakistani territory, and the Pakistan Government has
protested repeatedly.[16]

The United States, on the other hand, has condemned
Pakistan for allowing Islamic extremists in Afghanistan
to have safe havens, which pose threats to the United
States. In August 2017,“No partnership can survive a
country’s harboring of militants and terrorists who target
U.S. Service members,” President Trump said. That same
month, the government announced the suspension of
$255 million in Foreign Military Assistance to Pakistan.
Following this, in January 2018, it also announced the
suspension of security assistance to Pakistan. These
measures will not be lifted until the Pakistani Government
takes decisive action against terrorist groups, including
the Afghan Taliban. Attention will be paid to further
action by the two countries moving forward.

[See]


**(2) Relations with the United States**
Besides supporting the activities of the U.S. Forces in
Afghanistan, Pakistan cooperates with the war on terror by
launching mop-up operations against Islamic extremists
in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border area. Recognizing the
efforts of Pakistan, the United States designated it as a
“major non-NATO ally” in 2004.
The two countries conducted strategic dialogues
from 2010, and the United States provided Pakistan with
military support. However, these were suspended after
U.S.-Pakistan relations deteriorated as a consequence of
the then Osama Bin Laden mop-up operation conducted
by the U.S. Forces in the territory of Pakistan in May
2011. In October 2013, dialogue was resumed after
summit meetings were held between then President
Obama and then Prime Minister Sharif of Pakistan, and
in January 2014, Pakistan and the United States held their
fi rst strategic dialogue in three years.


16 In November 2011, NATO forces conducted airstrikes on border posts in Pakistan, causing casualties to Pakistani soldiers. Pakistan strongly condemned this action and retaliated by closing the ground
supply route for ISAF. Additionally, it is reported that at an all-party conference organized by the leaders of the ruling and opposition parties in September 2013, the Government adopted a resolution

**Section 8 Europe**


1 General Situation

With the end of the Cold War, many European countries
now recognize the need to address diverse security
challenges, such as outbreaks of regional confl ict within
and around Europe, the rise of terrorism, the proliferation
of WMDs, and an increasing number of cyberspace
threats. At the same time, these countries had recognized
that the threat of large-scale invasion by other countries
had disappeared. Nevertheless, since the heightening of
tensions in Ukraine in February 2014, there is a growing
need to revisit existing strategies and plan new concepts
in order to deal with Russia’s changes to the status quo
with force in the background and “hybrid warfare.”
With regard to international terrorism, the incidents of
terrorism occurring within European nations, including
the terror attacks in Paris in November 2015 and the terror
attacks in Brussels in March 2016, has made counterterrorism efforts an urgent task.[1] In addition, the number
of refugees and migrants crossing into Europe since 2015
has soared due to turmoil in the Middle East, including
the prolonged civil war in Syria. Although there has been
a downward trend in the number recently, ensuring border
security remains a challenge.
To respond to such challenges and situations, Europe


has sought to further strengthen and expand[2] multilateral
frameworks, such as NATO and the EU. At the same time,
it is working to contribute to the security and stability of
the international community by proactively participating
in activities outside the European region. Moreover, steps
are taken at the national level by reviewing security and
defense strategies, reforming national defense systems,
and strengthening bilateral[3] and multilateral[4] defense and
security cooperation
Further, in light of changes in the security
environment, the downward trend of defense expenditure,
and the drastically expanding gap of defense expenditure
between the United States and other member states, in
2014 NATO member states agreed on the goal to allocate
2% or more of their GDP to national defense spending
until 2024.[5] On this goal, at the NATO Summit held in
May 2017, President Trump strongly urged countries that
had not yet done so to increase their national defense
spending by more than 2% of their GDP. Also, at a press
conference held after the NATO Summit of July 2018, he
said he believed their national defense spending should
rise to 4% of their GDP.

[See] Fig. I-2-8-1 (Expansion Situation of NATO/EU Member States)


Recent terrorist incidents in Europe include an ISIL sympathizer driving a truck into a crowd of people in Nice, France in July 2016, a truck being driven into a Christmas market in Berlin, Germany
in December 2016, a vehicle being driven into a crowd of pedestrians in London, United Kingdom in March 2017, a suicide bombing in Manchester in central United Kingdom that occurred in May
2017, and a vehicle being driven into a crown of pedestrians in the center of Barcelona, Spain in August 2017. European countries are now reviewing their security systems and tightening immigration
controls, among other measures. See Part I, Chapter 3, Section 1.

NATO has continued expanding towards Central and Eastern Europe with the aim of stabilizing the entire European and Atlantic regions. In December 2015, at the NATO Foreign Ministers meeting,
Montenegro was invited to begin accession talks. In June 2017, Montenegro acceded to NATO. Currently, two countries—Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina—have been approved to participate
in the Membership Action Plan (MAP), which is a program that provides support to future member states in their preparation to enter NATO (conditionally for Bosnia and Herzegovina). The participation
in the MAP of six other countries—Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Kazakhstan, and Moldova—is currently undecided, as these countries support initiatives for integration into the European
and Atlantic regions through frameworks such as the Individual Partnership Action Plan (IPAP), which is a program offered to countries that have the intent to deepen political cooperative relationships
with NATO.

For example, the United Kingdom and France signed the Treaty between the United Kingdom and the French Republic for Defence and Security Co-operation and the Treaty between the United
Kingdom and the French Republic relating to Joint Radiographic/Hydrodynamics Facilities at a summit meeting held in November 2010. In addition, at the United Kingdom-France Summit
Meeting in January 2018, the defense ministers of both countries agreed on the establishment of the United Kingdom-France Defence Ministerial Council as a permanent forum for discussions
on defense cooperation.

For example, in September 2010, the four European countries of France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium established the European Air Transport Command (EATC) to jointly deploy transport
aircraft of the respective countries such as C-130 and A-310, as well as approximately 150 aerial refueling aircraft. Luxemburg joined EATC in 2012, Spain in July 2014, and Italy in December 2014.

As of August 2018, only fi ve (the United States, Greece, Estonia, the United Kingdom, Latvia) out of 29 member states had achieved the appropriate standard. On the other hand, at a news
conference ahead of the NATO Summit in Brussels, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced the outlook that eight countries would achieve allocating 2% of GDP to national defense
spending in 2018. Furthermore, the declaration adopted at the NATO Summit held in Brussels in July 2018 cited some two-thirds of Allies have national plans in place to spend 2% of theirs

2 Enhancement of Multinational Security Frameworks


arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation.
Following Russia’s “hybrid warfare” over Ukraine
as well as the frequent “unusual fi ghts” of Russian Armed
Force aircraft over the European front, including three
Baltic states, NATO and member states reaffi rmed the
threat posed by Russia. In April 2014, they suspended
practical cooperation with Russia and took other steps,
including expanding its Baltic air policing mission, which
had taken place from 2004 when the three Baltic nations
joined NATO.[7] Additionally, at the NATO Summit held
in Wales in September 2014, leaders adopted a joint
declaration demanding Russia to retract its “annexation”
of Crimea and adopted the Readiness Action Plan (RAP)
for enhancing existing readiness forces.[8] This plan was
created in order to deal with the infl uence of Russia and
threats from the Middle East and North Africa. Based on
this plan, NATO has continued to maintain its presence in
eastern allies, while steps have been taken to signifi cantly
improve the readiness of the existing multinational


1 NATO


Founded for the core task of collective defense among
member states, NATO has expanded the scope of its
activities to confl ict prevention and crisis management
since the end of the Cold War.
In the NATO Summit held in Lisbon in November
2010, NATO adopted a new Strategic Concept[6] for the
fi rst time in 11 years to propose a guideline for the next
decade for the creation of a more effi cient and fl exible
alliance. The document cites major threats such as
proliferation of WMDs and ballistic missiles, terrorism,
confl ict or instability beyond NATO borders, and cyberattacks, and prescribes three core tasks as follows:
(1) collective defense in accordance with Article 5 of
the NATO Treaty, the basic treaty of NATO; (2) crisis
management including confl ict prevention and postconfl ict stabilization and reconstruction assistance; and
(3) cooperative security including active contribution to


The Strategic Concept is an offi cial document defi ning the objectives, characteristics, and basic national security responsibilities of NATO. The document has so far been formulated seven times (1949,
1952, 1957, 1968, 1991, 1999, and 2010).

NATO has conducted air policing on a rotational basis since 2004. The missions involved patrolling the skies of a single country with four aircraft, but since the crisis in Ukraine, the missions were
enhanced, shifting to patrolling the skies of four countries with 16 aircraft. In September 2015, the missions were reduced to patrols above two countries with eight aircraft. Similar air policing by
NATO has been conducted over Slovenia, Iceland, Albania, and Bulgaria in addition to the three Baltic nations.

RAP was approved as one of the concrete efforts of the Connected Forces Initiative (CFI). CFI is intended to provide a framework for conducting joint exercises and drills among member states.

NATO Response Force (NRF) and create the Very High
Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) that can be mobilized
within two to three days.[9] Furthermore, the declaration
adopted at the NATO Summit held in Warsaw in July
2016 cited Russia’s aggressive actions and terrorism by
ISIL as threats. At the meeting, a decision was reached
to deploy four battalions to the three Baltic nations and
Poland on a rotational basis. Specifi cally, at the defense
ministers meeting held in October 2016, it was decided
that the battalions would be multinational in nature
with more than 20 countries participating, including the
United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and Canada,
which would be leading the battalions, and became fully
operational in 2017. Member states view Russia in varying
ways due to differences in their geographic distance from
Russia and other factors. While measures are being taken
to counter Russia’s infl uence, member states are also
maintaining opportunities for dialogue with Russia.[10]
The declaration adopted at the NATO Summit in Brussels
in July 2018 cited as follows: (1) establishment of the
Joint Force Command Norfolk in the United States, the
headquarters aimed at strengthening defense of Atlantic
Ocean sea lanes that link the United States and Europe,
(2) establishment of the Joint Support and Enabling
Command in Ulm, Germany, the headquarters aimed
at expediting transport of troops and equipment within
or outside Europe (3) arrangement of the Readiness
Initiative called the “Four Thirties” by 2020 to maintain
a situation in which 30 mechanized battalions, 30 air
squadrons, and 30 combat vessels can be ready to use
within 30 days or less.
In the Mediterranean, a permanent maritime force
has been deployed to the Aegean Sea since February
2016 due to the infl ux of illegal immigrants transiting the
Mediterranean. This force monitors the infl ux of illegal
immigrants and shares information with Turkey, Greece,
and other countries. Also, in November 2016, Operation
Active Endeavor, focused on collective defense held
since 2001, was succeeded by Operation Sea Guardian,
focused on crisis management, resulting in a wider array


of missions including counter-terrorism and capacitybuilding assistance, among others.
Since August 2003, NATO had been leading ISAF in
Afghanistan. Its mission was completed in December 2014.
In place of this mission, since January 2015, NATO has
been leading the Resolute Support Mission (RSM), whose
primary tasks are to provide training, advice, and assistance
to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces
(ANDSF). At the NATO Defense Ministers Meeting held
in November 2017, it was decided to strengthen support in
Afghanistan, including reinforcements of 3,000 personnel,
and the number of essential personnel in Afghanistan
expanded to 16,000 personnel.
Besides Afghanistan, NATO is also carrying out
missions in Kosovo, Somalia, and other countries.[11] Since
October 2008, NATO had dispatched ships from the
permanent maritime forces to the Gulf of Aden and Indian
Ocean to take part in Operation Ocean Shield to combat
piracy, but these activities ended in December 2016.
With regard to ISIL, NATO has taken the stance of
emphasizing prevention over intervention. In addition,
in the fi ght against ISIL, the Wales Summit Declaration
of September 2014 strongly condemned ISIL’s violent
acts and affi rmed that NATO would activate its
collective defense if any member state were attacked by
ISIL. Furthermore, the Warsaw Summit Communiqué
of July 2016 set forth the decision to dispatch early
warning and control forces to fi ght against ISIL, with
surveillance and reconnaissance missions taking place
since October 2016.

2 EU


The EU seeks to enhance its security initiatives under
the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP)
and Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP),[12]
and in June 2016, Global Strategy for the European
Union’s Foreign and Security Policy detailing the EU’s
fundamental approach to foreign and security policy
was adopted by the European Council for the fi rst time


9 The NRF consists of 40,000 personnel, and the VJTF is a multinational force consisting of approximately 20,000 personnel from the NRF (including 5,000 land force personnel).

10 For example, France held talks with President Putin of Russia following the terror attacks in November 2015, and the two sides agreed to exchange intelligence between their military forces. The
United Kingdom, in its strategy document SDSR2015, states that the issues of Ukraine would signifi cantly change the rules-based international order, while it also states that the country would seek
ways to cooperate with Russia on the issues of ISIL topping the list. Germany, too, has stated the need for deterrence and dialogue with Russia in its white paper on national defense published in
July 2016. Additionally, in April 2016, NATO held the dialogue framework of the NATO-Russia Council in Brussels for the fi rst time in almost two years, which was followed by meetings in July and
December 2016, March, July, and October 2017, and again in May in 2018.

11 In Kosovo, NATO has carried out its mission within the framework of the Kosovo International Security Force since 1996. Today, NATO provides recommendations, training, and capacity-building
assistance to the Kosovo Security Force. In Somalia, NATO takes part in transport operations and dispatches expert personnel to tactical divisions as support for the AU Somalia Mission.

12 The EU, although it has a property of non-binding multilateral cooperation, introduced the CFSP, which covers all areas of foreign and security policy based on the Treaty of Maastricht, which took
effect in 1993. In June 1999, the European Council decided to implement the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) to offer peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance activities in confl ict


-----

in approximately 10 years. This document calls for
initiatives towards enhancing the EU’s internal and
external resilience against threats to order in Eastern
Europe, and the threat of terrorism or other events in the
Middle East and Africa, in accordance with the principles
of rules-based order and democracy. In November 2016,
an agreement was reached on the execution of this
strategy, with priority given to responding to confl ict and
crises outside of the EU, capacity building of partners, and
protecting EU citizens from terrorism and other threats. It
also required assigning priority to necessary capabilities
and deepening relations among member states. In the same
month, the European Commission released an action plan
for reinforcing defense cooperation in Europe, including
the establishment of the European Defence Fund. In
addition, in December 2017 Permanent Structured
Cooperation (PESCO) was launched as a defense
cooperation framework participated by 25 countries
among the member countries. Under this framework, the
participating countries fi nance joint projects including
joint development of equipment and infrastructure that
will contribute to developing readiness. It is expected that
the framework would strengthen the EU’s defense, so its
future movements will be the subject of attention.
In response to the crisis in Ukraine, the EU has
condemned the military measures of Russia and
implemented economic sanctions against Russia.[13] In
addition, to support the economic and political reforms
in Ukraine, the EU continues its engagement in nonmilitary affairs, including the provision of large-scale
fi nancial assistance to Ukraine.
To deal with the threat of ISIL, the EU extends funds
to carry out humanitarian assistance for Syria and Iraq.
Additionally, the EU works with countries in regions such
as the Middle East and North Africa to provide capacitybuilding assistance in counter-terrorism measures, among
other activities. In November 2015, in accordance with a
request from France after the terror attacks in Paris, the
EU, for the fi rst time, activated the “mutual assistance
clause”[14] stipulating a mutual defense obligation, and EU


member states expressed their support to France.[15]
In May 2015, the EU started Operation Sophia
conducted by European Union Naval Force Mediterranean
(EUNAVFORMed) due to the surge of refugees and
migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea into Europe.
The fi rst phase focusing on the monitoring of smuggling
and human traffi cking networks was completed in
October 2015. The operation has entered the second phase
involving the search, seizure, and diversion on the high
seas of vessels suspected of being used for smuggling and
human traffi cking. Furthermore, at the Foreign Affairs
Council meeting held in June 2016, agreement was
reached to add two tasks to Operation Sophia: training
of the Libyan Navy Coast Guard; and providing support
for implementing the UN arms embargo on the high seas.
Also, in October 2016, the European Border and Coast
Guard was established, with its own equipment and at
least 1,500 personnel ready at any time for emergency
deployment in order to crack down on the infl ow of
refugees and immigrants.
In June 2016, the United Kingdom conducted a
national referendum to decide whether or not the country
should leave the EU. Following the victory of the proBrexit camp, the United Kingdom gave offi cial notice in
March 2017 to the EU of its intention to exit the EU. In
December 2017, the EU and the United Kingdom reached
a basic agreement on the terms of the United Kingdom’s
exit from the EU, and the negotiations moved into the
“second phase,” including trade negotiations. In March
2018, the EU and the United Kingdom tentatively agreed
on the introduction of a “transition period” of about one
year and nine months to avoid an upheaval because of the
economic environment following the United Kingdom’s
exit from the EU.
In 2003, the EU led peacekeeping operations for the
fi rst time in Macedonia by using NATO’s equipment and
capabilities. Since then, it has been actively committed
to the operations in crisis management and maintenance
of peace and order[16] by, for example, sending troops to
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Democratic Republic of the


13 The EU takes measures, such as capital regulations and ban on exports of equipment and dual use goods, along with asset freezes and travel bans, and extends its expiry date every six months.

14 Article 42, Paragraph 7 of the Treaty on European Union provides for a mutual defense obligation, where if a EU member state is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other member
states shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter.

15 On November 17, 2015 after the terror attacks, then Minister for Defence Jean-Yves Le Drian of France requested the application of the “mutual assistance clause” at the EU Foreign Affairs Council
meeting. The application was agreed upon unanimously. Based on the application of the clause, France requested other EU member states to: (1) contribute to counter-ISIL operations in Iraq and
Syria; and (2) help reduce the military burden of France by contributing to France’s counter-terrorism operations in Mali, Central Africa, and other areas. Nevertheless, the extent of cooperation has
remained relatively small, except for that from the United Kingdom and Germany.

Congo, Chad, Mali, and Central Africa. For example, in
January 2014, the EU decided to dispatch security forces
to Central Africa, where the situation had been of constant
tumult. The forces commenced operations in April 2014
and completed its mission by March 2015. In the same
month, the EU launched the European Union’s Military
Advisory Mission (EUMAM) to support preparations
for security sector reform in Central Africa. Since July
2016, the European Union’s Training Mission (EUTM)
has succeeded the mission, which continues to modernize
military forces in Central Africa. Also, the EU has been
conducting Operation Atalanta, the fi rst maritime mission
to combat piracy off the Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden
since December 2008. Under this mission, vessels and
aircraft dispatched from each country protect ships in the
area and conduct surveillance in these waters.[17]

3 Security / Defense Policies of European Countries


3 Cooperation between NATO and the EU


Advancements have been seen in cooperation between
NATO and the EU. At the NATO Summit held in July
2016, a joint declaration was released citing fi elds which
NATO and the EU should prioritize cooperation, and at
the NATO Foreign Ministers Meeting and the EU Council
meeting in December 2016, 42 recommendations in
seven fi elds were adopted for implementing the joint
declaration. At the NATO Foreign Ministers Meeting
in December 2017, 32 cooperation items in three fi elds
were added. Based on these recommendations, NATO’s
Operation Sea Guardian and the EU’s Operation Sophia
are now mutually collaborating in the Mediterranean,
and NATO and the EU are also advancing cooperation
in fi elds of responding to hybrid threats, cybersecurity,
and capacity development.

1 The United Kingdom

After the end of the Cold War, the United Kingdom,
perceiving that there is no direct military threat
against the country, has advanced national defense
reform with particular focus on improving its overseas
deployment capability and readiness, in order to deal
with new threats such as international terrorism and
proliferation of WMDs.
Against this backdrop, in November 2015, the
Cameron administration released the National Security
Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review (NSSSDSR2015) in the face of destabilization in the Middle
East, including the rise of ISIL, the crisis in Ukraine,
and the threat posed by cyber-attacks. Recognizing that
the United Kingdom confronts threats from both states
and non-state actors, the NSS-SDSR2015 sets out the
challenges that the United Kingdom should address in
the coming decade as follows: terrorism and extremism;
resurgence of state-based threats; technological
developments including cyber threats; and the erosion of


the rules-based international order. While the previous
SDSR2010 committed to cutting the troop strength,
reducing key equipment, and reviewing procurement
plans due to pressure to decrease defense spending,[18] the
NSS-SDSR2015 calls for ending the defense spending


17 To tackle piracy in this area, the EU has undertaken “European Union Training Mission-Somalia” and “European Union Maritime Security Capacity Building Mission in Somalia,” in addition to Operation
Atalanta. Based on a comprehensive approach, the EU not only implements piracy countermeasures, but is also working to develop and strengthen its coastal policing and judicial system capabilities.

18 The SDSR2010 committed to decreasing defense spending by 8% by FY2014, including at least 4.3 billion pounds in non-front line savings, excluding spending for operations such as in Afghanistan.
The SDSR2010 decided to decrease, by 2015, Royal Navy personnel by 5,000, Army personnel by 7,000, and Royal Air Force personnel by 5,000, along with reduction of the holdings of main battle
tanks by 40%. In the Army realignment plan “Army 2020” released later in July 2013, the United Kingdom was to reduce the Army’s active military personnel from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020, while


-----

cuts and explicitly proposes to increase the defense force
in order to develop capacities to address the entire list of
expanded threats.[19] The NSS-SDSR2015 lays out that the
United Kingdom would continue to be a key player in the
international community, and promote procurement of
equipment and formation of units with high readiness and
mobility, in view of dealing with threats such as terrorism
and cyber security.[20] In December 2017, the aircraft
carrier Queen Elizabeth was put into commission.
Since September 2014, the United Kingdom has
conducted airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq. In addition, it
carries out ISR activities using unmanned aerial vehicles,
provides education and training to forces engaged in
ground warfare such as the Iraqi Security Forces and
Peshmerga, a military organization of the Kurdistan
Regional Government, as well as extends humanitarian
assistance to refugees. Furthermore, following the
terror attacks in Paris, the United Kingdom decided in
December 2015 to extend the scope of the airstrikes from
Iraq to Syria, and commenced airstrikes in Syria on the
day after the Parliament gave its approval.[21]
With regard to the Asia-Pacifi c region, the NSSSDSR2015 presents the view that the region offers
signifi cant economic opportunities for the United
Kingdom, and has considerable infl uence on the future
integrity and credibility of the rules-based international
order. It then expresses commitment to attaching
importance to working with the United Kingdom’s
security partners including Japan. In particular, it
considers Japan as the United Kingdom’s closest security
partner in Asia. In the National Security Capability
Review (NSCR) issued in March 2018 as well, Japan
and the ROK are considered to be strong partners for
security, prosperity, and working on global issues. Based
on this view, in this region, the United Kingdom conducts
Operation Patwin, a natural disaster assistance mission
to the Philippines, participates in the multilateral joint
exercise RIMPAC, and conducts goodwill trainings
with Japan.[22] In addition, in February 2018, the Rt Hon
Gavin Williamson, Secretary of State for Defense of the
United Kingdom clearly referenced that the British Royal
Navy Frigate HMS Sutherland would be sailing through


the South China Sea and making it clear that the Royal
Navy has a right to do that. In early May 2018, in order
to contribute to international efforts to monitor prohibited
trading at sea by North Korea, the HMS Sutherland
conducted information gathering activities regarding
ships suspected of conducting “ship-to-ship transfers” in
the waters surrounding Japan. Further, in April 2018, the
Ministry of Defence of the United Kingdom announced
that the Royal Navy’s landing ship HMS Albion, along
with the Royal Navy frigate HMS Argyll in the latter half
of 2018, would be dispatched to the Asia-Pacifi c region.
The deployment of these three ships means that the Royal
Navy would have an almost unbroken presence in the
Asia-Pacifi c region throughout 2018.
In March 2017, the United Kingdom offi cially
informed the EU of its intention to leave the union. While
the United Kingdom will continue to be a NATO member
state, some have noted that the United Kingdom’s exit
from the EU would reduce the EU’s military capacity by
around one-fourth. Therefore, attention will be given to
various trends, including the EU’s security initiatives and
relations with NATO.

2 France


Since the end of the Cold War, France has focused on
maintaining independence of its defense policies, while
having led initiatives to enhance the defense structure and
capability in Europe. It has worked on the development
of its military capacity by streamlining and integrating
military bases, dealing with operational requirements to
strengthen its defense capability, as well as enhancing
its intelligence capabilities and modernizing equipment
required in the future.
The Defence and National Security Strategic
Review announced by the Macron administration in
October 2017 states that the threats that France faces,
including domestic terrorism, the refugee issue, and
the Ukraine crisis, are diversifying, increasing in
complexity, and rapidly becoming more violent, and
amidst the increasingly multipolar international system,
competition is intensifying among major military powers


19 The “NSS-SDSR2015” will maintain the size of the Armed Forces personnel and increase the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force by 700 personnel combined. It also decided to build two aircraft carriers,
introduce nine new maritime patrol aircraft, and maintain a fl eet of four strategic nuclear submarines. Underpinned by a stable economy, the NSS-SDSR2015 is to maintain defense expenditure
amounting to 2% of GDP which is the NATO’s target and to further increase defense spending, especially equipment procurement spending.

20 The NSS-SDSR2015 is to add two Typhoon squadrons, establish a F-35 squadron capable of operating from new aircraft carriers, create two strike brigades of up to 5,000 personnel, and have a
system that can deploy an expeditionary force of around 50,000 personnel overseas by 2025.

21 Since 2014 and as of February 2018, the United Kingdom has conducted over 1,600 aerial bombings, held training for over 60,000 Iraqi military soldiers, and dispatched over 1,400 United Kingdom
military personnel.

22 From October to November 2016, Typhoon fi ghters visited Japan to take part in Japan-U.K. joint exercises. See Part I, Chapter 3, Section 3-4 regarding the maritime security strategy of the United


-----

and the danger of escalation is growing. Under these
conditions, France will continue to fulfi ll its duties within
NATO including for collective defense and contributing
to security, and will take a leading role in efforts to
strengthen the EU’s defense. In addition, in the Military
Planning Law for 2019-2025 announced in February
2018, a total of approximately 300 billion euros will be
allocated for defense expenditure by 2025, and there was
confi rmation of President Macron’s commitment to the
goal of allocating 2% of France’s GDP to its defense
budget by 2025.
France has been conducting airstrikes against
ISIL in Iraq since September 2014 and in Syria since
September 2015.[23] Following the terror attacks in Paris
in November 2015, France declared a state of emergency
domestically, and decided to deploy 10,000 military
personnel to maintain domestic security and suspend
troop reductions. Outside of France, the country enhanced
its airstrikes against ISIL in Syria and deployed mobile
units including the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle
to the Mediterranean Sea. Furthermore, France has
continued to provide education and training to the Iraqi
Security Forces and Peshmerga, as well as humanitarian
assistance for refugees.
Since France has territories in the Indo-Pacifi c region,
it places importance on its commitment to the region. The
Strategic Review issued in October 2017 points out the
potential for a threat to benefi ts, such as the freedom of
navigation, due to the worsening strategic situation in the
Asia-Pacifi c region, and clearly states that France will
maintain its stance of protecting its sovereignty of its
overseas prefectures and territories in the Pacifi c Ocean
and the Indian Ocean. Further, France has indicated its
policy to continue strengthening its worldwide partnership
network, from Africa to the Middle East to the AsiaPacifi c region. In May 2018, during his visit to Australia,
President Macron stated that the Paris-Delhi-Canberra
axis is absolutely key for the Indian-Pacifi c region. In
addition, in February 2018, France had the Floréal class


frigate Vendémiaire make a port call in Japan and conduct
joint exercises with the MSDF, and has proactively
organized the multilateral exercises Exercise Croix du
Sud and Equateur in the South Pacifi c.


3 Germany


While Germany has been implementing a large-scale
reduction of its military personnel since the end of the
Cold War, it has been gradually expanding the dispatch
of its federal forces overseas. At the same time, Germany
has advanced the reform of its armed forces to enable
them to execute multiple responsibilities encompassing
confl ict prevention and risk management in the context of
multilateral organizations, including NATO, the EU, and
the UN. However, following a worsening in the security
environment, in May 2016 Germany changed policy and
announced that it would increase military personnel by
around 7,000 by 2023.[24]
The country’s defense white paper released in July
2016 for the fi rst time in about 10 years explains that
Germany’s security environment has grown more complex
and unstable, causing gradually rising uncertainty, citing
specifi c threats such as international terrorism, cyberattacks, interstate confl ict, and the infl ux of refugees and
immigrants. The white paper also states that Germany
would continue to emphasize multilateral cooperation
and cross-government approaches, while striving to
realize rules-based international order. Furthermore,
with regard to the number of military personnel, the
white paper notes that although an upper limit was in
place following the end of the Cold War and Germany
has continually worked to reduce personnel, it would
shift to a policy with no upper limit and perform regular
reviews of its military force plan to adjust the number of
personnel fl exibly.
In Iraq, Germany has thus far provided education
and training to the Iraqi Security Forces and Peshmerga,
supplied equipment and ammunition, extended fi nancial


23 As of January 2018, France has mobilized 1,100 personnel, 10 Rafale fi ghters, 1 frigate, among other assets.

24 Germany decreased its military personnel strength which was once more than 500,000 at the time of its reunifi cation to 250,000 by 2010. In 2016, personnel were cut further back to 177,000.
However, since July 1994, when the Federal Constitutional Court judged that dispatching the federal forces to international missions under multilateral frameworks such as the United Nations and
NATO was constitutional, Germany has gradually expanded dispatch of its federal forces to participate in various international operations, including security maintenance and reconstruction activities

assistance for humanitarian assistance, as well as
conducted training of Kurdish troops in Germany. In
December 2015, following the terror attacks in Paris in
November 2015, the Cabinet approved plans to provide
logistics support to the Coalition that is conducting
counter-ISIL military operations. This expanded German
engagement in counter-ISIL military operations, albeit
the commitment is limited to logistics support missions,
such as reconnaissance and aerial refueling.[25]


With regard to the Asia-Pacifi c region, Germany
considers it to be important from the standpoint of its
large population and economic strength, and expresses the
view that the region plays a central role in international
politics, while on the other hand, the region faces issues
such as being home to two-thirds of the world’s poor.
Germany’s military engagement in the region is limited
to disaster relief missions and goodwill visits, and does
not include joint training.


25 The decision was made on the following commitment during the 12-month period from early January to end of December 2016: (1) dispatch the frigate Augsburg to escort the French aircraft carrier
Charles de Gaulle; (2) deploy Tornado fi ghters (up to six fi ghters) and aerial refueling aircraft to Incirlik Air Base in Turkey; and (3) deploy up to 1,200 personnel to areas of ISIL’s operations in Syria,
their airspace, the eastern Mediterranean Sea, Persian Gulf, and Red Sea to collect intelligence using reconnaissance satellites and share this intelligence with relevant countries. This decision also
added the dispatch of personnel to NATO’s AWACS (airborne warning and control system) unit to the mission. Furthermore, Germany strives to reduce the operational burden of France by increasing

**Section 1 Trend in International Terrorism and Regional Confl icts**


1 General Situation

In a global security environment, there is a growing risk
that unrest or a security problem in a single country or
region could immediately develop into a destabilizing
factor that could affect the entire international community.
The confl icts occurring in recent years in various
parts of the world are not necessarily of the same nature.
In addition to an array of problems, which is at the root
of confl icts, including ethnicity, religion, territory, and
resources, the impacts of climate change and other global
issues have also been suggested as causes of confl icts.[1]

There are also cases where the political turmoil
accompanying regime change leads to confl icts between
ethnic groups, religious sects, or political factions that
can become prolonged against a background of public
dissatisfaction over economic and social disparities and/
or high unemployment rates. The human rights violations,
refugees, hunger, poverty, and other consequences of
confl icts can have impacts on not only the parties of
the confl icts but also a wider area. States with weak
governance are also fi nding it diffi cult to tackle risks such
as the explosive outbreak and spread of infectious diseases.
Furthermore, in the Middle East and Africa, there
are prominent cases where power vacuums in some
states with political instability and weak governance
have become hotbeds of the activities of international
terrorist organizations such as Al Qaeda and ISIL.
These organizations are leveraging inadequate border
controls to expand and step up their operations
across national borders while securing the personnel,
weapons, and drugs that serve as a source of funding.
There also exists organizations that have the ability to
carry out terrorist acts in places far from their bases,
continuing to pose imminent security challenges to the
international community.


Furthermore, in developed countries, such as
the United States and European countries, there has
been an increasing number of cases of young people
who are inspired by the extreme ideology spread by
international terrorist organizations against the backdrop
of dissatisfaction over estrangement from society,
discrimination, poverty, and disparities, resulting in
joining the international terrorist organizations as fi ghters
or conducting “homegrown” terrorism activities in their
home countries.
Regarding Japan, during the terrorist incident
regarding the murder of Japanese nationals in Syria in
early 2015, ISIL explicitly announced that Japanese
nationals would be the targets of terrorist attacks. ISIL
also issued a statement claiming responsibility for the
murder of Japanese in Bangladesh in October of the
same year, and later referred to the incident in its offi cial



**[KEY WORD]**

“Homegrown” and “lone-wolf” terrorism

“Homegrown” terrorism in which residents are inspired by the

extremism espoused by Al Qaeda or ISIL and conduct terrorist attacks

at home has become a threat in European countries and the United

States. In particular, there are concerns that their nationals would

accumulate combat training and combat experience in confl ict-torn

regions such as Iraq and Syria, become indoctrinated into extremism,
and then return to their countries and conduct terrorist attacks.

In recent years, “lone-wolf” terrorism is also seen as a threat

because it is diffi cult to detect signs in advance and prevent it. “Lonewolf” terrorism is planned and committed by individuals or groups who

become infl uenced by extremist ideology through information found on

the Internet and elsewhere, without having any offi cial relations with

terrorist organizations such as Al Qaeda and ISIL.


The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) released by the U.S. Department of Defense in March 2014 regards climate change as one of key factors that will shape the future security environment. It
claims that climate change may accelerate instability and conflict by causing water scarcity sharp increases in food costs and other effects

bulletin when it listed Japanese nationals as their targets.
Bearing in mind the terror attack at a restaurant in Dhaka,
Bangladesh in July 2016, we Japanese must face up to
the threat of international terrorism as our own problem.[2]

It has become increasingly important that the
international community should examine the shape
of tailored international frameworks and involvement
measures, and seek out appropriate responses to these
complicated and diverse destabilizing factors.
Amid these situations, in recent years, mandates
of the UN PKO[3] have come to include a wide range
of areas, including not only traditional roles like the
monitoring of a ceasefi re or military withdrawal but also
activities by civilians and police such as the monitoring
of disarmament, security sector reform, the monitoring of
elections and administrative activities, and humanitarian
assistance (e.g., return of refugees to their homeland).
This also suggest that the importance of the roles related
to the protection of civilians and peace-building, in
particular, has been growing.

[See] Fig. I-3-1-1 (List of Peacekeeping Operations)

[See]


2 Trends surrounding International Terrorism


In addition to the UN PKO framework, multinational
forces and regional organizations authorized by the UN
Security Council have engaged in confl ict prevention,
peacekeeping, and peacebuilding. In Africa, regional
organizations such as the African Union (AU)[4] undertake
their activities based on UN Security Council resolutions,
and their activities are sometimes handed over to UN
PKOs later. The international community also offers
recommendations and training assistance and supplies
equipment, from a long-term perspective, prompting
African nations self-help efforts to enhance local
government organizations and improve the capabilities
of their military and security organizations.
Concerning international counterterrorism measures,
the proliferation of the threat of terrorism has gained
momentum while its perpetrators are increasingly diversifi ed,
making it even more diffi cult to prevent terrorist attacks. For
this reason, international cooperation on counterterrorism
measures has become even more important. Currently, the
international community as a whole is taking various steps,
including military means as well as measures to cut off the
funding sources for terrorist organizations and prevent the
international movement of terrorists.[5]

destabilized the situation there. Beginning in January
2014, they invaded northern Iraq and in June took control
of Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq. Following
this, ISIL unilaterally declared the establishment of the
“Islamic State” with its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi
as “caliph,”[6] and effectively controlled certain areas
spanning Iraq and Syria through its well-developed
organizational structure and the issue of its own currency.
Participating in ISIL are members from the former
Iraqi regime and former Iraqi military offi cers and soldiers,
as well as foreign fi ghters who migrated to Iraq and Syria
in response to calls from ISIL. ISIL used social media


1 Trends in ISIL-related International Terrorist
Organizations

**(1) Activities in Iraq and Syria**
The objective of ISIL as an organization is to outright
reject the conventional system of national governance in
the region and claim the establishment of the caliphate
based on its own interpretation of Sharia law and the
protection of Sunni Muslims.
ISIL gained strength in Syria from 2013 on by
seizing the opportunity in Syria when clashes between
the government and rebel forces occurred in 2011 and


The seventh issue of the ISIL propaganda magazine Dabiq published in February 2015 included descriptions of the murder of two Japanese nationals in Syria and renewed a call for terror attacks on
Japanese nationals and interests. Furthermore, the 11th issue (published in September 2015) called for terror attacks on Japanese diplomatic missions in Bosnia, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The 12th issue
(published in November 2015) described the murder of a Japanese national in Bangladesh and warned again that Japanese nationals and Japanese interests would be the targets of terror attacks.

As of the end of April 2018, 14 UN PKOs were operating globally, including about 89,905 military and police personnel and about 15,000 civilian personnel (as of the end of August 2017) from 124
countries. Out of these UN PKOs, there were 10 operations in the Middle East and Africa. (See Fig. I -3-1-1)

The world’s largest regional organization comprised of 55 countries and regions in Africa. It was established in July 2002 by reorganizing the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) (established in May
1963). Its objectives include achieving the integration and solidarity of African nations and people, accelerating political, economic, and social integration of Africa, and promoting peace, security, and
stability in Africa. In January 2017, the AU General Assembly approved the accession of Morocco, the only non-member in Africa.

In September 2014, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2178 on the issue of foreign terrorist fi ghters. The resolution requested member states to make exits from their countries for the
purpose of executing acts of terrorism punishable under domestic laws. The resolution also includes measures obligating member states to prevent entry or transit through their territories of any
individual about whom that state has credible information that demonstrates reasonable grounds for believing that the individual is attempting to enter or transit through its territory for the purpose of
participating in acts of terrorism. In addition, at the G7 Summit held in Germany in June 2015, the leaders reaffi rmed their commitment to effectively implement the established international framework
for the freezing of terrorists’ assets.

The term means “successor” in Arabic. After Prophet Muhammad died, the term has been used to refer to those who led the Islamic community. Since then, a number of the heads of hereditary

**(2) Progress in Military Operations against ISIL and the**
**Current Situations of ISIL**

In response to the expansion of ISIL’s reach since January
2014, the Coalition forces led by the United States
have been conducting air strikes in Iraq and Syria since
August and September of the same year respectively.[10]
The coalition forces have also engaged in education and
training of local forces, supply of weapons, and rescue of
hostages by the special forces.
In Iraq, the Iraqi Security Forces (including
paramilitary troops and the police, in addition to Iraqi
government forces) and the Peshmerga, the military
organ of the KRG, cooperated with the Coalition to
recapture key cities in Iraq including Kirkuk,[11] Ramadi,[12]
and Fallujah. In particular, in July 2017, the Iraqi Security
Forces recaptured Mosul which is important as the symbol
of the expansion of ISIL’s infl uence. Subsequently, the
ISIL strongholds remaining in northern and western
Iraq such as Tal Afar, Hawija, Al-Qaim and Rawa were
also recaptured, and the Iraqi Government announced in
December 2017 that all Iraqi territory had been liberated
from ISIL.
In Syria, meanwhile, in addition to air strikes by
the Coalition, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF),
composed mainly of local Kurd and Arab forces, have
conducted operations against ISIL in northern Syria with
support from the United States and others. As the result,
in October 2017, they recaptured Raqqa, the putative
capital of “Islamic State,” and also conquered Syria’s
largest oil fi eld, situated in Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria.
Russia launched its military operation in Syria
in September 2015 with the purpose of the survival of
the Assad administration and protection of Russian
bases in Syria.[13] It carried out air strikes and launched
cruise missiles from the sea, dropped precision satelliteguided bombs from strategic bombers, and temporarily
deployed the aircraft career Admiral Kuznetsov to
conduct air strikes.[14] With this support from Russia,
the Assad administration conquered ISIL strongholds,

and other elements of cyberspace under a sophisticated
public relations strategy to issue propaganda for the
organization, recruit fi ghters and call for terrorist acts. As
a result, they appear to have gained many supporters, and
it has been noted that more than 40,000 foreign fi ghters
actually travelled to Iraq and Syria.
As for obtaining weapons and ammunition, ISIL
is believed to engage in looting in addition to utilizing
illegal traffi cking networks. In particular, when they
invaded northern Iraq in the fi rst half of 2014, they
managed to pillage a variety of equipment from the Iraqi
military facilities that they occupied. Furthermore, it
has been noted that ISIL has also begun producing and
modifying weapons. It has been pointed out that they are
manufacturing IEDs from chemicals obtained through
legal channels and using them in suicide bombings.[7] It
has also been confi rmed that they are using tactics such
as modifying small commercial drones so that they can
carry hand grenades and the like and attacking enemy
vehicles by dropping bombs loaded on them.[8] Regarding
the use of drones, it has been noted that ISIL attempted to
expand the damage by using camera-equipped drones to
skillfully guide suicide-attack vehicles.[9] It is believed that
ISIL is using these new tactics in recent fi ghting.


7 It has been noted regarding the IEDs that ISIL used between July 2014 and February 2016 that parts and components manufactured and/or exported by approximately 50 fi rms in 20 countries fell
into the hands of ISIL, who used them within a year after it acquired them.

8 ISIL has published videos in which it attacks tanks and the like with explosives dropped from drones. It has been noted that the purpose is to destroy some vehicles and force them out of the frontlines
through such attacks.

9 It has been noted that ISIL has been amplifying the effect of its attacks by using drones to fi nd targets from the air and providing instructions to suicide bombers at the ready on the ground and
instructing optimal paths for them.

10 As of August 2017, the Coalition had conducted 13,331 and 11,235 air raids in Iraq and Syria respectively.

11 The Peshmerga remained stationed in Kirkuk after recapturing it from ISIL and effectively controlled it. However, when the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) implemented a referendum on
independence in September 2017, the Iraqi Government dispatched security forces and subdued the city the following month.

12 After the recapture, new problems have emerged, including confrontation between Shiites and Sunnis.

13 Tartus is the only Russian naval base facing the Mediterranean Sea in Syria, reportedly having a dockyard that can provide fuel and food to and repair military ships.

citizens in Baghdad and Damascus, respective capitals of
Iraq and Syria, and elsewhere in both countries. In other
words, the threat of ISIL in Iraq and Syria has not been
eliminated completely. It is important for the international
community to continue to engage towards the stability
of the two states in order to prevent ISIL forces from
expanding again.

**(3) Dispersion beyond Iraq and Syria**
After ISIL declared the establishment of the “Islamic
State,” multiple “provinces” have been established
outside of Iraq and Syria as the “Islamic State” territories
(see fi gure), and these “provinces” have been conducting
terrorist acts in each place. On the Sinai Peninsula in
Egypt, an organization claiming to be the Islamic StateSinai Province has been conducting a series of terrorist
acts against the military and police as well as Christians.[16]
In Afghanistan, the Islamic State-Khorasan Province has
conducted sporadic terrorist acts in its capital Kabul and
elsewhere.[17] Terrorist attacks claimed by ISIL “provinces”
have also been confi rmed in Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Libya
and elsewhere. It is believed that the threat of terrorist


mainly in southern and eastern Syria such as Palmyra
and Deir Ezzor. In December 2017, Russia declared
that Syria’s entire territory had been liberated from ISIL
and announced that it would pull out some of its troops
deployed in Syria while maintaining its bases there.
It is believed that the number of ISIL fi ghters and
ISIL revenue have declined signifi cantly as a result of the
progress in these operations against ISIL. At the same
time, it is believed that approximately 3,000 ISIL fi ghters
remain in hiding, mainly near the Iraq-Syria border,[15] who
are conducting terrorist acts against security forces and

15 In a December 2017 tweet, the spokesperson for the Coalition expressed the understanding that the number of ISIL’s foreign fi ghters remaining in Iraq and Syria was under 3,000.

16 For example, suicide bombing and shooting attacks aimed at police vehicles occurred in September 2017 on the Sinai Peninsula, for which ISIL-Sinai Province claimed responsibility.

**(4) Foreign Fighters**
Many foreign fi ghters fl owed into Iraq and Syria with the
rise of ISIL since 2014. However, as the strength of ISIL
ebbed, it is believed that that number of foreign fi ghters
travelling to Iraq and Syria is declining.[19]

Meanwhile, a major concern has been raised that
foreign fi ghters acquiring combat training and combat
experience in Iraq and Syria would return to their
countries and conduct terrorist attacks there. It is believed
that at least 5,600 foreign fi ghters had returned from Iraq
and Syria to their home countries by October 2017.[20]

Amid such circumstances, it has been pointed out that
the terrorists who carried out the simultaneous attacks in
Paris in November 2015 included ones who mingled with
refugees and immigrants in entering Europe.[21]

Like the terrorist act that occurred in Belgium in
August of the same year, there is also the possibility
that ISIL has made foreign fi ghters return to their home
countries where they are ordered to conduct terrorist
attacks.[22] The international community is required to
continue to take various initiatives going forward in order
to prevent such terrorist acts by foreign fi ghters.


acts by such organizations will continue in the future.
Furthermore, organizations claiming to be ISIL in
countries where no “provinces” have been established
exist and have conducted terrorist attacks targeting
security forces and citizens. Particularly in the
Philippines, in May 2017, an Abu Sayyaf Group (ASF)
faction and the Maute group pleading allegiance to ISIL
occupied part of the city of Marawi on the island of
Mindanao. The Philippine Government declared martial
law and launched military operations, and the fi ghting
continued for around fi ve months. In October of the
same year, the Philippine Government took control of
Marawi and declared an end of the fi ghting. However,
the search for individuals connected to the organizations
supporting ISIL continues and security has yet to be
fi rmly established. Elsewhere, there is concern that
the threat posed by ISIL is permeating Southeast Asia
with the existence of organizations supporting ISIL in
Indonesia for one.[18]


Commentary Diffusion of the ISIL threat **COLUMN**

While ISIL, which rapidly emerged in Iraq and Syria from 2014, has considerably lost infl uence in these countries recently, related
organizations operating in the Middle East, Africa, and other regions continue to actively engage in terrorist efforts and there are also
organizations in Southeast Asia that claim allegiance to ISIL.
Furthermore, ISIL continues to encourage terrorism in areas outside of Iraq and Syria with propaganda over the Internet and
other efforts. Individuals and groups inspired by ISIL’s thinking have recently conducted terrorist attacks in Western countries. ISIL
supporters in various regions worldwide might carry out terrorist attacks considering encouragement by ISIL in its journals and other
materials to target large-scale outdoor gathering and other venues with large numbers of people using vehicles, knives, and other
readily available means. More than 5,600 fi ghters with battle experience in Iraq and Syria have returned to their home countries,
and it is thought that these fi ghters returned to 33 countries. Terrorist threats have been diffused worldwide via returning fi ghters.
The international community hence needs to closely cooperate and promptly implement effective countermeasures of the
ongoing threat of terrorism by ISIL-related organizations and ISIL supporters in various regions around the world.

18 In Indonesia, a series of bombing and shooting attacks occurred in Jakarta in January 2016, and an organization supporting ISIL claimed responsibility. It is also believed that Indonesians and
Malaysians participated in an organization supporting ISIL in the fi ghting in the city of Marawi.

19 In an October 2017 press conference, the spokesperson for the Coalition expressed the understanding that there were virtually no foreign fi ghters fl owing into Iraq and Syria at the time.

20 According to the Soufan Center, the number of foreign fi ghters returning to their home countries are approximately 800 in Tunisia, 760 in Saudi Arabia, 425 in the United Kingdom, approximately 300
in Germany, 271 in France, and so on.

21 Since the series of terror attacks in Paris, the French forces deployed 10,000 troops in France to guard domestic transportation systems, tourist spots, and the like. Although the number of troops
was reduced to 7,000, they continue security activities domestically and otherwise engage in protecting the public.

**(4) Al-Shabaab**
“Al-Shabaab,” a Sunni extremist organization based in
Somalia, mainly conducts terrorist acts against Somali
military forces and police as well as the African Union
Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), the peacekeeping forces
stationed for the purpose of stabilizing the situation
in Somalia after the civil war. In September 2017,
suicide bombing and shooting attacks against Somali
military bases occurred, for which Al-Shabaab claimed
responsibility. The Somali authorities concluded that the
car-bomb attacks in December of the same year in which
more than 500 people were reportedly killed was carried
out by Al-Shabaab, although no one claimed responsibility
for it. Furthermore, Al-Shabaab has conducted terrorist
acts in Kenya and Djibouti, posing threat not only to
Somalia but also to its neighboring countries.

3 Trends of Other International Terrorist Organizations


**(1) Taliban**
The Taliban is an organization based in Afghanistan
with the objective of establishing a state governed by
Sharia law. Its forces were diminished signifi cantly
for a while by the mop-up operations launched by the
United States following the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the
United States. However, with the end of the mission of
the U.S.-led International Security Assistance Force
(ISAF) in December 2014, the Taliban has been stepping
up its offensive again and expanding the control areas
within Afghanistan.[26] It also continues suicide attacks
and shootings as well as rocket attacks targeting the
government and foreigners.
The Taliban held its fi rst peace talks with the Afghan
Government in July 2015. However, it has hardened its
confrontational posture since then and has not shown a
willingness to take part in peace talks even after a new
supreme leader was appointed in May 2016.[27]


2 Trends in Al Qaeda-related International Terrorist
Organizations

**(1) Al Qaeda**
With regard to Al Qaeda, which is believed to have
directed the 9/11 attacks in 2001, it is believed to have
been weakened as the group’s previous leader Osama
Bin Laden as well as many executives were killed in U.S.
operations. However, it is considered that it continues
its activities as a core organization such as issuing
instructions and recommendations to its affi liates in
North Africa and the Middle East. In addition, its current
leader Zawahiri has repeatedly issued statements calling
for terrorist acts against the West.[23] The possibility of Al
Qaeda attacks has not disappeared.


**(2) Al Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP)**
Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), a Sunni
extremist organization based in Yemen, is mainly active
in south Yemen, continuing their fi ght against the Yemeni
security forces and the opposition insurgent group Houthis.
The United States has continued air strikes using UAVs[24]
and killed many AQAP leaders. However, AQAP has taken
advantage of the instability in Yemen to maintain a certain
level of force there. It also spreads extreme ideology
utilizing propaganda videos and magazines.

**(3) Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM)**
Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM),[25] a Sunni
extremist organization based in Algeria and also active in
Mali, Tunisia, and Libya has mainly conducted terrorist
attacks and kidnapping against Algerian security forces
and Europeans and U.S. nationals. Although the strength
of AQIM has declined due to the French-led military
intervention that started in 2013, the group is still
continuing its terror attacks in Algeria and Mali, while
organizations under the AQIM umbrella are instigating
terrorist attacks in states such as Burkina Faso and Mali.


23 Recently, it published a statement criticizing the Trump administration in the United States for its recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and calling on Muslims to attack the interests of the
United States and its allies.

24 In 2017, the U.S. Central Command announced that it conducted more than 120 air raids in Yemen in one year.

25 The January 2013 terrorist attack in Algeria resulting in victims of Japanese nationals is believed to have been executed by the “Masked Brigade,” which had broken away from AQIM. In 2015, the
Brigade merged with other organizations to form “Al-Murabitoun” and returned to the AQIM fold. Furthermore, in 2017, this merged with yet other organizations to form Jama Nusrat al-Islam walMuslimin (JNIM; literally, protector of Islam and Muslims).

26 After occupying Kunduz in the northeast for several days in September 2015, the Taliban has been expanding its area of control, mainly in the north and south.

27 In July 2015, the death of Mullah Mohammad Omar, founder of the Taliban and its former supreme leader, was confi rmed. Akhtar Mansour was elected as supreme leader but died in in May 2016


-----

**(2) Boko Haram**
In Nigeria, Boko Haram, a Sunni extremist organization,
has repeatedly carried out terror attacks targeting mainly
citizens. It is believed that its infl uence is declining due
to the mop-up operations that the Nigerian military is
mounting together with neighboring countries. However,
it continues its activities, mainly in northeast Nigeria,
and a suicide bomb attack that is believed to have been
conducted by Boko Haram occurred at a mosque in the
northeast in January 2018.


have occurred. The terrorist act in November 2017 when a
truck ran through a bicycle path in New York is considered
a “lone-wolf” terrorist act. ISIL and Al Qaeda have been
using propaganda magazines and other means to introduce
specifi c methods for terrorist acts to supporters who want
to conduct such “lone-wolf” terrorist acts. For example,
ISIL gives detailed examples of specifi c methods and
targets for terrorist acts using knives and vehicles in its
magazine Rumiyah. Al Qaeda also has used its magazine
to publish how to make a bomb using material close at
hand. “Lone-wolf” terrorism is also seen as a threat to the
international community because it is diffi cult to detect
signs in advance and prevent it.
More recently, terrorist acts have been confi rmed
that are conducted in an organized manner by fi ghters
sent in by terrorist organizations or by local individuals
or organizations under instructions from terrorist
organizations. These incidents indicate that the forms
of terrorist acts are becoming diversifi ed and that the
capacity of terrorist organizations to execute operations
is improving, raising concern that the threat of terrorism
is growing.


4 The Threat of “Home-grown” Terrorism


As Al Qaeda and ISIL call for terrorism attacks around
the world, “home-grown” terrorism, in which residents
are inspired by the extremism espoused by these
organizations and conduct terrorist attacks at home,
continues to be a threat.
In recent years, “lone-wolf” terrorism, planned and
committed by individuals or small groups who do not
have any offi cial relations with international terrorist
organizations but have become infl uenced in some way,

same year, an agreement was reached on the creation of
“safe zones” in four locations within Syria where fi ghting
and air strikes would be forbidden while Russia, Turkey,
and Iran would dispatch troops to Syria to monitor the
ceasefi re. Later, in January 2018, the Syrian National
Dialogue Congress was held in Sochi, Russia, where
it was agreed to establish a constitutional committee
towards the enactment of a new constitution. However,
the main opposition forces and Kurdish forces did not
participate in the congress. It will draw attention whether
talks towards the enactment of a new constitution will
make progress.
In this manner, various efforts towards peace and
stability are being made. However, large-scale clashes
occurred in what are supposed to be “safe zones” in
Idlib province in northern Syria and in Eastern Ghouta
on the outskirts of the capital Damascus.[29] Particularly in
Eastern Ghouta, Syrian forces intensifi ed their offensive
with support from Russian forces, resulting in many


1 Situation in Syria


The violent clashes in Syria since March 2011 pits four
parties, the Syrian government forces, opposition forces,
Islamic extremist forces, and Kurdish forces against each
other. However, government forces have gained the upper
hand overall, as they recaptured Aleppo, which was once
a stronghold of rebel forces, in December 2016 with
support from Russia.
Against this backdrop, UN Security Council
Resolution 2254[28] adopted in December 2015 established
a road map for the peace process, and peace talks have
been taking place since January 2016 between the
government and opposition forces under UN auspices.
However, fi ghting did not abate on either side and there
was no progress to be seen in the initiative towards peace.
Under these circumstances, peace talks sponsored
by Russia, Turkey, and Iran began in Astana, Kazakhstan
in January 2017. In the fourth meeting held in May of the


28 UN Security Council Resolution 2254 calls for establishing an inclusive and non-sectarian government and setting a schedule and process for drafting a new constitution within six months, and
expresses support for the holding of free and fair elections within 18 months pursuant to the new constitution.

casualties among citizens.
Under these circumstances, the United States, the
United Kingdom, and France determined that the Assad
administration had used chemical weapons in eastern
Ghouta and showed the determination not to allow the
proliferation and use of chemical weapons, conducting
missile attacks on Syrian facilities related to chemical
weapons in April 2018. Russia and Iran, who support the
Assad administration, are pushing back at the attack by
the three states.
Furthermore, as the infl uence of ISIL wanes in Syria,
a confrontation over the status of Kurds is emerging.
The Kurds exhibited movement towards the expansion
of autonomy such as the unilateral announcement in
March 2016 led by Democratic Union Party (PYD), the
Kurdish political party, to introduce a federative system
in northern Syria, and implementation of their own local
elections in September 2017[30] and the like. Turkey, which
deems PYD to be a terrorist organization, invaded Afrin
in northeastern Syria in January 2018 and announced in
March of the same year that it had taken control of the
city center of Afrin.
In this manner, the military clashes between the
forces within Syria still do not show signs of ending,
and peace talks are also stalling. Further initiatives from
the international community towards the stabilization of
Syria is required.


In September 2017, Hamas announced its intent to
accept the administrative control of the Gaza Strip by Fatah.
In October of the same year, direct consultations were held
through the mediation of Egypt, in which the two parties
agreed on the handover of administrative authority by
December. However, subsequent negotiations encountered
diffi culties, while the Trump administration announced
on December 6 of the same year that the United States
would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. After
that, the security situation deteriorated temporarily as
demonstrations and other protest activities took place
day after day in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and
people were injured or killed in clashes with the Israeli
security forces. Tensions rose as rockets were fi red from
the Gaza Strip at Israeli territory and as a response to that,
Israel intercepted rockets fi red from the Gaza Strip and
conducted air strikes on the Gaza Strip. In May 2018,
immediately after the relocation of the U.S. Embassy in
Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, protest activities in
the Palestinian Autonomous Area were activated again,
which resulted in many casualties particularly in the
Gaza Strip. Future movements in the Middle East peace
process including engagement by the United States
and the future direction of negotiations towards the
transfer of administrative authority over the Gaza Strip
bears watching.

3 Situation in Yemen


In Yemen, anti-government protests occurred from
February 2011 and international pressure led to a
transition from then President Ali Abdullah Saleh to new
President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi through election.
Meanwhile, the confrontation between the government
and the opposition insurgent group Houthis,[32] based in
northern Yemen, intensifi ed. In September 2011, the
Houthis occupied the capital Sana and President Hadi
evacuated to the city of Aden in the south.
Later, as the Houthis invaded the city of Aden,


2 The Situation Surrounding Middle East Peace


Since the foundation of Israel in 1948, there have been
four wars between Israel and Arab countries. The 1993
Oslo Agreement was signed between Israel and Palestine
and a peace process made temporary progress but has
fallen short of achieving peace.[31] In the Palestinian
territories, the moderate Fatah, which governs the West
Bank of the Jordan River, and the Islamic fundamentalist
Hamas, which effectively controls the Gaza district, are
in confl ict, splitting the area.


30 In September 2017, elections were held in the areas controlled by Kurdish forces in which each commune, the smallest administrative district, elected two representatives, one man, one woman,
each. In December, assembly elections were held at the municipal level. However, the election for the equivalent of a parliament that was scheduled to be held in January 2018 was postponed in the
wake of the attack on Afrin by Turkish forces that month.

31 Between Israel and Palestine, a peace process through full-fl edged negotiations started through the 1993 Oslo Agreement. In 2003, both Israel and Palestine accepted a roadmap for realizing a peace
initiative featuring the peaceful coexistence of two countries. However, its implementation has made little progress. Later, following rocket attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip, Israeli forces launched
large-scale military actions from late 2008 to early 2009 that included airstrikes on the Gaza Strip and the mobilization of ground forces. In November 2012, Israeli forces again conducted airstrikes
on the Gaza Strip. By 2012, Israel thus conducted two major military operations against the Gaza Strip. In both cases, fi ghting ceased under mediation by Egypt and others.

32 The Houthis are followers of the Zaydi branch of Shiite Islam and are based in Saada governorate in northern Yemen. From 2004 to 2010, the Houthis staged an armed uprising as an anti-government


-----

President Hadi sought assistance from Arab countries. In
response, in March 2015, coalition forces led by Saudi
Arabia began air strikes against the Houthis.
A series of peace talks intermediated by the United
Nations took place between April and August of the same
year, but a fi nal peace agreement has yet to be reached.[33]
Military operations by Saudi-led coalition forces against
the Houthis and the launching ballistic missiles into
Saudi Arabia and other attacks by the Houthis continue.[34]
The coalition launched operations to recapture Houthicontrolled Hodeidah, Yemen’s second-largest port city,
and announced that they had occupied the airport there.
Meanwhile, regarding the ballistic missile attacks by the
Houthis, which have mainly targeted the Saudi south, the
Houthis have announced that they have launched ballistic
missiles at Riyad, the Saudi capital, since November
2017. In response, Saudi Arabia is claiming that it has
intercepted the ballistic missiles launched by the Houthis.
The United States and Saudi Arabia also claim that the
missiles launched at Riyad were provided by Iran.
Under these circumstances, in December 2017,
former President Saleh, who had joined forces with the
Houthis to fi ght against the Saudi-led coalition forces,
extended an offer for a ceasefi re and talks with the Saudiled coalition forces. The Houthis rejected this and killed
the former president. Meanwhile, inside the governmentaligned forces, the Southern Transitional Council, which
seeks independence for south Yemen, clashed with the
Hadi administration and overran a military base and
government buildings in Aden. These situations have
added further confusions in Yemen.

4 Situation in Afghanistan


In Afghanistan, following the 9/11 terrorist attacks
in the United States, the U.S. Forces launched mopup operations against the Taliban and other groups in
November 2001. Furthermore, the security duties by the
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and the


Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF)
among other efforts have reportedly been reducing the
Taliban’s assault capabilities to a certain degree. However,
around the time that ISAF withdrew in December 2014
after completing its mission and the NATO-led “Resolute
Support Mission (RSM)” started to train, advise and assist
the ANDSF as its core mission, the Taliban intensifi ed
their offensive resulting in security deterioration.
Meanwhile, the ANDSF faces challenges with logistics,
morale, air capabilities, and troop-commander leadership,
and the Taliban is expanding its own areas of control in
Afghanistan amidst these circumstances. According to a
report released by the U.S. Special Inspector General for
Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) in October 2017,
the areas controlled by or under the infl uence of the
Afghan Government was approximately 57% of Afghan
territory, the lowest since December 2015, when the
survey started.
Furthermore, in addition to the Taliban, ISIL has
established “Khorasan Province” in eastern Afghanistan
and expanded its activities. Suicide bomb attacks and
rocket attacks that the Taliban and ISIL are believed to
be involved have occurred one after another around the
country. When U.S. Secretary of Defense Mattis visited
Afghanistan in September 2017, several rockets hit
Kabul International Airport and the surrounding area,
and both the Taliban and ISIL claimed responsibility.
In January 2018, a suicide bomb attack occurred in the
center of Kabul killing more than a hundred people with
the Taliban claiming responsibility while ISIL attacked
an NGO offi ce in Jalalabad in the east in the same month.
Instability continues in the security situation nationwide.
In June 2018, Afghanistan and the Taliban both announced
a ceasefi re unilaterally. However, the Taliban abandoned
the ceasefi re after three days and reopened its attacks. It
is unclear whether the security situation may stabilize.
The fi rst peace talks between the Afghan Government
and the Taliban were held in May 2015 but has not been
resumed since after the subsequent change in the supreme


33 The fi rst round of peace talks under the mediation by the UN took place in Geneva. Both the Yemeni Government and anti-government forces participated in the talks and had indirect consultations
but fell short of reaching any fi nal agreement. In Switzerland in December 2015, the Yemeni Government and anti-government forces held the second round of peace talks, realizing their fi rst direct
negotiations. Although a ceasefi re was put into force before the second round, repeated ceasefi re violations occurred, leading the second round to be suspended without any major achievement.

34 In June 2015, the Houthis and Yemeni forces units supporting former President Saleh red a Scud missile at Khamis Mushait in southern Saudi Arabia. Saudi forces red two Patriot missiles to intercept
the Scud and identifi ed and destroyed the Scud launching site in southern Saada governorate. Since then, multiple similar incidents have occurred. It has been suggested that the Yemeni Scud missile

leadership. Although the Afghan Government called out
to the Taliban for dialogue, the Taliban has been silent
on peace talks, and there are yet to be prospects for
reopening the talks.


6 Situation in Egypt


In Egypt, where then-President Mubarak, who had
been serving as the president for approximately three
decades, resigned in 2011, and then-President Mursi,
who had been a member of the Muslim Brotherhood,[35]
was inaugurated. However, in June 2013, large-scale
protests of the people occurred amidst the poor economic
situation and the deterioration of security. The military
intervened in response and dismissed the president. In
May 2014, former Defense Minister Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi
was inaugurated as president. In the three years since
its inauguration, the el-Sisi administration undertook
economic reforms including a shift to a fl oating exchange
rate system and the abolition of subsidies. However,
enhancing domestic security measures is still a major
challenge. In November 2017, an armed group assaulted
a mosque in the northern Sinai Peninsula leaving more
than 300 people dead. Countermeasures against terrorism
are urgently required.[36]

President el-Sisi was reelected in presidential
election held in March 2018 with approximately 97% of
the votes. In the election, a former prime minister, a former
parliament member, and former military chief of staff
who were seen as strong candidates declined one after
another to run or were detained by the authorities, leaving
only one opponent for the president. Approximately 41%
voted, a fi gure lower than in the previous election.


5 Situation in Libya


In Libya, following the collapse of the Gaddafi regime
in 2011, elections for a General National Congress were
held in July 2012, establishing a congress consisting
mainly of Islamists. In June 2014, elections for a
Council of Representatives were held to establish a
new congress to replace the General National Congress.
However, since secularists became the majority, the
confrontation between Islamic and secular groups
intensifi ed, and consequently, Libya became fragmented
between east and west with two assemblies existing
in parallel – the Islamic groups’ General National
Congress based in the capital city of Tripoli and the
secular groups’ Council of Representatives based in
Tobruk in eastern Libya. In December 2015, the UN
mediated a political agreement for Libya and a national
consensus government was established in March 2016.
However, as Islamic groups took control of the new
government, secular groups turned their back and
refused to join the national consensus government. As
a result, Libya remains divided between the East and
the West. In addition, militias supporting the east and
west respectively continue sporadic military clashes.
Under these circumstances, there are no prospects for
establishing domestic governance and security yet.
In addition, ISIL, Al Qaeda, and other terrorist
organizations are gaining ground in these unstable
circumstances and clashing with militias around the
country. ISIL in particular is believed to be divided into
small groups and in hiding, mainly in the desert regions
in southern Libya. In October 2017, car bomb attacks
targeting the militias occurred for which ISIL claimed
responsibility. Further terrorist acts will likely occur in
the future.


7 Situation in South Sudan


**(1) Political Turmoil**
The North-South civil war that had continued since 1983
between the Sudanese Government consisting mainly
of Arab Muslims in the north and the anti-government
group consisting mainly of African Christians in the
south came to an end in 2005 with the entry into force of
the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) brokered by
neighboring countries, the United States, and others. In
July 2011, the Republic of South Sudan was separated and
gained independence from the Republic of the Sudan as the


35 A Sunni political organization established in Egypt in 1928 as an organization targeting the general public to “revive Islam.” In the 1950s, it became a target of a clampdown for plotting the
assassination of President Gamal Abdel Nasser. However, by the 1970s, the organization became moderate to the extent of conducting political activities through parliament. Meanwhile, extremist
organizations were derived, with Muslim Brotherhood serving as the parent organization.


-----

result of the referendum held in January 2011 according
to the provisions of the CPA. On the same day, the UN
Mission in the Republic of South Sudan (UNMISS) was
established as the result of the independence.[37] Salva Kiir
Mayardit, a Dinka, became president while Riek Machar,
a Nuer, became vice president. However, political turmoil
continued even after the independence.
The political confl ict between the pro-Kiir faction
(mainstream) and the pro-Machar faction (anti-mainstream
group)[38] was brought to the surface after President Kiir had
dismissed Vice President Machar and all the other cabinet
ministers in July 2013. Following this, in December of the
same year, clashes that broke out between the government
and the pro-Machar faction in the capital city of Juba
and violent acts targeting specifi c ethnic groups spread
to different areas of the country in a short span of time,
resulting in a large number of casualties, refugees, and
internally displaced persons (IDPs).

**(2) Beginning of Peace Building**
With the establishment of UNMISS in July 2011, the
“Intergovernmental Authority on Development” (IGAD)[39]
assisted by the UN and the AU initiated efforts to start
dialogues among South Sudanese leaders and enable
their reconciliation. In January 2014, the IGAD helped
the government and the pro-Machar faction to sign an
agreement on ceasing hostile activities in South Sudan.
Having partly boosted by these initiatives, in August
2015, the government, the pro-Machar faction and others
reached the Agreement on the Resolution of the Confl ict
in the Republic of South Sudan (ARCSS), including the
establishment of a transitional government. In response
to the agreement, the UN Security Council also added
support for the implementation of the agreement to
the UNMISS mandate. Later, efforts to implement the
agreement were made, and on April 29, 2016, Transitional
Government of National Unity was established in which
Mr. Kiir and Mr. Machar were the president and the fi rst
vice-president respectively.


**(3) Recent Trends**
In July, 2016, a shooting occurred in Juba between
the security forces of President Kiir and First Vice
President Machar. Following this, Machar left Juba
and fled the country, and President Kiir dismissed
Machar from the office.
Given this harsh situation, the international
community has joined forces for peace and stability. The
nation-building process for South Sudan is now entering
a new stage.
In August 2016, the UN Security Council created
the Regional Protection Force (RPF)[40] for the purpose of
maintaining security in Juba and surrounding areas. In
April 2017, an advance party of Bangladesh’s construction
engineering company arrived in South Sudan as the fi rst
unit of the RPF.
More troops continue to be dispatched. In December
of the same year, the fi rst High-Level Revitalization
Forum[41] was held under the leadership of IGAD,
where cessation of hostilities was agreed between the
government, the pro-Machar faction and others.
In December 2016, the South Sudanese Government
announced the initiation of the national dialogue[42] in
order to promote national reconciliation and advance
the progress of consensus. In May 2017, a swearing-in
ceremony of the national dialogue steering committee


37 The initial mandate period was one year, with UNMISS comprised of up to 7,000 military personnel and up to 900 police personnel. UNMISS was designed to fulfi ll the roles of: (1) supporting peace
consolidation and thereby fostering long-term state building and economic development; (2) supporting the Government of the Republic of South Sudan in exercising its responsibilities for confl ict
prevention, mitigation, and resolution and protection of civilians; and (3) supporting the Government of the Republic of South Sudan in developing its capacity to provide security, to establish the rule
of law, and to strengthen the security and justice sectors.

38 From here on, the anti-mainstream faction formed around Machar is referred to as the pro-Machar faction.

39 IGAD was established in 1996. Its members are the eight East African nations of Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, Uganda, Eritrea, and South Sudan.

40 According to UN Security Council Resolutions 2304 and 2406, the Regional Protection Force (RPF) is responsible for providing a stable environment for Juba and neighboring areas, and also in other
areas in South Sudan, as necessary. The RPF is authorized to use all necessary means to achieve the following three mandates: (1) facilitation of conditions for safe and free movement both in and
outside of Juba; (2) Protection of the airport and key facilities; (3) Engaging to any actor that is credibly found to be preparing attacks on UN protection-of-civilians sites or civilians, etc.

was held to launch the national dialogue. Since then, some
progress in the initiatives towards domestic stability,
including the commencement of grass-roots level
dialogues nationwide, has been confi rmed. In June 2018,
President Kiir, former First Vice President Machar and
others signed “Khartoum Declaration of Agreement on
South Sudan,” under which a permanent ceasefi re came
into force. However, the details of the political system
and security arrangements have not been specifi cally
determined, so the situation bears watching.

the central south which had served as the bases of AlShabaab. In the following month, Al- Shabaab‘s leader
was killed by the attacks of the U.S. Forces.
Al-Shabaab has been weakened to some degree as
a result of these operations, but it still exists as a threat.
It frequently stages attacks against the bases of Somali
and AMISOM forces and terrorist attacks within Somalia
and in AMISOM member countries.[46] It has been pointed
out that ISIL fi ghters have been fl owing into Somalia in
recent years.[47] In these circumstances, counterterrorism
operations by U.S. forces have been intensifi ed since
March 2017, when President Trump approved the
intensifi cation of the operations in certain areas by U.S.
forces deployed in Somalia.
Additionally, in Somalia, especially in the north
eastern part, there are believed to be outposts of pirates
who are active off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf
of Aden. The international community implements a
series of initiatives to enhance the security capabilities
of Somalia based on the perception that instability
of Somalia triggers piracy issues. The international
community has continued to implement initiatives off the
coast of Somalia, which have contributed to steadily low
level of the reported number of pirates attacks.

9 Situation in Mali


**(1) Anti-government Insurgents**
In Mali, an anti-government Tuareg[48] insurgent group,
the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad
(MNLA), raised a rebellion in January 2012. Other
groups, including “Ansar Dine,” an Islamic extremist
group joined the rebellion. The MNLA conquered some
northern cities and declared the independence of the
northern region in April 2012. Subsequently, Islamic
extremist groups, including Ansar Dine that expelled the
MNLA, “Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa”
(MUJAO), and “Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb”
(AQIM),[49] started to govern the northern region based on
the Sharia law, aggravating the humanitarian and security
situations in northern Mali.


8 Situation in Somalia


**(1) Establishment of an Integrated Government**
Somalia has been in a state of anarchy since its
government collapsed in 1991.[43] It continues to face a
serious humanitarian crisis to this day as a large number
of refugees are generated. After 14 years, in 2005, the
Transitional Federal Government (TFG) was inaugurated
through the intermediation of the neighboring countries.
In 2012, when the period for provisional governance by
TFG ended, a new cabinet was inaugurated, and a unifi ed
government was established for the fi rst time in 21 years. In
February 2017, a presidential election was held, in which
Mohamed Abdullah Mohamed Farmajo, a former prime
minister in the TFG defeated then-incumbent President
Hassan Sheikh Mohamud to become president. President
Farmajo is currently rebuilding the Somali National
Armed Forces with support from other countries.[44]

**(2) The Rise of Al-Shabaab and the Piracy Issue**
Somalia faces two issues, terrorism and piracy. AlShabaab, a Sunni extremist organization based in the
central south, has repeatedly conducted terrorist attacks
against the government and other targets. In 2007, the
African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM)[45] was
established with the approval of the UN Security Council
to stabilize the situation.
In August 2014, AMISOM, jointly with the Somali
National Armed Forces, launched “Operation Indian
Ocean” and successfully recaptured some of the cities in


43 “Somaliland” located in the Northwest declared its independence in 1991. “Puntland” located in the Northeast declared the establishment of an autonomous government in 1998.

44 In May 2017, the United Kingdom hosted the “London Somalia Conference,” where cooperation by the international community towards strengthening Somali National Armed Forces was confi rmed.

45 Uganda, Burundi, Djibouti, Kenya, and Ethiopia supply most of the troops. Security Council Resolution 2372 (August 2017) determined that the troops would be reduced from 22,126 members to
21,626 by December 31, 2017 and further reduced to 20,626 by October 31, 2018.

46 In October 2017, a terrorist attack using Vehicle-Borne IEDs (VBIED) occurred in Mogadishu, killing more than 500 people.

47 In November 2017, U.S. forces conducted air strikes in Somalia targeting ISIL.

48 The Tuareg Tribe is a nomadic ethnic minority in the Sahara Desert. It is pointed out that the tribe has been in confl ict with the Government of Mali seeking for autonomy in northern Mali.

**(2) Initiatives to Build Peace**
In response to this situation, in December 2012, the
UN Security Council approved the deployment of the
African-led International Support Mission to Mali
(AFISMA),[50] whose tasks included revitalizing the
capabilities of Malian troops and security organizations
and supporting the Malian authorities. The Malian
provisional government recaptured major cities in the
northern part of the country, assisted by the sending
of troops by France and the deployment of AFISMA.
In April 2013, the UN Security Council decided to
establish the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated
Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), whose tasks
included the stabilization of densely-populated areas
and support for the reconstruction of national functions
throughout Mali. In July 2013, MINUSMA, which had
its authority delegated by AFISMA, became operational.
With the support of MINUSMA, a presidential election
was held in a peaceful manner, and a new government
was established in September of the same year.[51]
In May and June 2015, the Mali Government
signed the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation
with the armed groups “Platform” and “Coordination


des Mouvements de l Azawad (CMA) respectively.
In February 2017, the Mali Government and the armed
groups began joint patrols based on the Agreement.
However, little progress has been seen on the execution
of the Agreement and there is concern over the delay in
its implementation. Thus, in September of the same year,
a UN Security Council resolution was adopted for the
fi rst time to impose sanctions on individuals and others
who obstruct progress on the Agreement.
The UN Security Council decided in June 2016 to
increase the strength of MINUSMA by approximately
2,500 members and adopted a resolution in June 2017 to
give the political support of the UN Security Council to
the deployment of the G5 Sahel Joint Force[52] consisting
of up to 5,000 members. In addition, in December of
the same year, the UN Security Council requested the
Secretary-General to provide specifi ed support for the G5
Sahel Force through MINUSMA in support of initiatives
to counter terrorism by the countries in the region. At the
same time, 42 MINUSMA personnel died[53] as the result
of terrorist attacks and other causes in 2017 alone. The
unstable security situation continues and there is a need
for further progress in the peace process.


50 AFISMA receives troops from member states of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), including Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Niger, and Nigeria.

51 In June 2013, the provisional government and MNLA reached an agreement on such issues as allowing the northern area to participate in the presidential election and approving the dispatch of Mali
troops to northern cities.

52 The Joint Force consists of the following fi ve countries: Burkina Faso, Chad, Mari, Mauritania, and Niger.

**Section 2 Transfer and Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction**


The transfer and proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction (WMDs), such as nuclear, biological and
chemical (NBC) weapons, and ballistic missiles that
deliver such weapons, have been recognized as a signifi cant

threat since the end of the Cold War. In particular, there
still remain strong concerns that non-state actors, including
terrorists, against which traditional deterrence works less
effectively, could acquire and use WMDs.

Additionally, regarding the New Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty which was signed by the presidents of
the United States and Russia in April 2010, and took effect
in February 2011, the Trump administration expressed its
intention to continue to implement this Treaty. Similarly,
the United Kingdom also stated in the Strategic Defence
and Security Review (SDSR) in October 2010 that
the country would decrease the number of its nuclear
warheads, and the NSS-SDSR 2015 released in November
2015 confi rmed that there is no change in this policy to
reduce the number of nuclear warheads.[6]
In the area of “nuclear security” which addresses
terrorist activities that utilize nuclear and other radioactive
materials, the Nuclear Security Summit that commenced
at the proposal of then President Obama has been held
on four occasions. The fourth Nuclear Security Summit
that was held in Washington, D.C. in March-April 2016
adopted a Communiqué, which shared the recognition
that the threat of nuclear terrorism remains an imminent
challenge to the international community, and which
outlined the need for continuous efforts to prevent nuclear
materials from getting into the hands of non-state actors
even after the summit.[7] The Trump administration has
indicated it will promote cooperation with allies, partners
and international institutions to combat nuclear terrorism.
The Trump administration indicates concerns in
the 2018 NPR that Russia is improving its delivery
capabilities, including ground-launched cruise missiles
in violation of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
(INF) Treaty. It also criticizes Russia for rebuffi ng United


During the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962
raised awareness of the danger of a full-scale nuclear
war between the United States and the Soviet Union.
The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
(NPT) that took effect in 1970 prohibited countries other
than those that exploded a nuclear weapon or other
nuclear explosive device in or before 1966[1] from having
nuclear weapons, and provided that arms control and
disarmament of nuclear forces would be pursued through
two-way negotiations.[2]
The NPT is currently signed by 191 countries
and regions.[3] While some countries that had previously
possessed nuclear weapons became signatories of this
treaty as non-nuclear weapon states by abandoning
these weapons,[4] India, Israel, and Pakistan still refuse to
accede to this treaty as non-nuclear weapon states. There
are other countries that have declared the development
and possession of nuclear weapons, such as North Korea,
which announced that it conducted nuclear tests in
October 2006, May 2009, February 2013, January 2016,
September 2016, and September 2017.[5]

The Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) released by
the Trump administration in February 2018 states that
the United States “remains committed to its efforts in
support of the ultimate global elimination of nuclear,
biological and chemical weapons.” It also confi rms that
NPT is a cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation
regime and that the United States continues to abide by
its obligations under the NPT and will work to strengthen
the NPT regime.


The United States, the then Soviet Union (now Russia), the United Kingdom, France, and China. France and China acceded to the NPT in 1992.

Article 6 of the NPT sets out the obligation of signatory countries to negotiate nuclear disarmament in good faith.

As of June 2018

South Africa, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus

After North Korea announced its withdrawal from the NPT in 1993, it pledged that it would remain a contracting state to the NPT. However, North Korea again declared its withdrawal from the NPT in
January 2003. In the Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks adopted in September 2005, North Korea pledged to return to the NPT at an early date. Nonetheless, North Korea subsequently announced
the implementation of six nuclear tests. North Korea’s nuclear tests constitute a major challenge to the NPT.

The treaty stipulates that both countries would reduce the number of deployed strategic warheads to 1,550 and the number of deployed delivery vehicles to 700 by seven years following the treaty’s
entry into force. The United States reported that it had 1,350 deployed strategic nuclear warheads and 652 deployed delivery vehicles, while Russia reported that it had 1,444 deployed strategic
nuclear warheads and 527 deployed delivery vehicles. These numbers are as of February 5, 2018.

At the Nuclear Security Summit, it was confi rmed that the IAEA would play a central role in international nuclear security initiatives. Accordingly, the IAEA hosted the International Conference on Nuclear

management of pathogens and toxins.[14]
As for chemical weapons, Iraq repeatedly used
mustard gas, tabun, and sarin[15] in the Iran-Iraq War. In
the late 1980s, Iraq used chemical weapons to suppress
Iraqi Kurds.[16] It is believed that other chemical weapons[17]
that were used included VX, a highly toxic nerve agent,
and easy-to-manage binary rounds.[18] In August 2013,
sarin was used in the suburbs of Damascus, Syria, where
Syrian troops clashed with anti-government groups.[19] The
Syrian Government denied using chemical weapons, but
entered into the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)
in line with an agreement between the United States
and Russia. Subsequently, international efforts were
undertaken for the overseas transfer of chemical agents
and other measures based on the decisions made by the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons
(OPCW)[20] and a UN Security Council resolution.[21] In
August 2014, the operation to destroy Syria’s sarin,
VX gas, and other chemical weapons on the U.S. Navy
transport vessel Cape Ray was completed.[22]
In August 2015, in order to identify users of chemical
weapons in Syrian civil war, the UN Security Council
adopted a resolution that establishes a Joint Investigative
Mechanism of the UN and OPCW, and investigations
under this mechanism have been carried out. In November
2016, the term of this investigative mechanism was


Biological and chemical weapons are easy to manufacture
at relatively low cost and are easy to disguise as most
materials, equipment, and technology needed to
manufacture these weapons can be used for both military
and civilian purposes. For example, water purifi cation
equipment used to desalinate sea water can be exploited to
extract bacteria for the production of biological weapons,
and sodium cyanide used for the process of metal coating
can be abused for the production of chemical weapons.[10]
Biological and chemical weapons are attractive to
states and non-state actors, such as terrorists, seeking
asymmetric means of attack.[11]
Biological weapons have the following characteristics:
(1) manufacturing is easy and inexpensive; (2) there
is usually an incubation period of a few days between
exposure and onset; (3) their use is hard to detect; (4) even
the threat of use can create great psychological effects; and
(5) they can cause mass casualties and injuries depending
on the circumstances of use and the type of weapon.[12]
As has been pointed out, advancements in life
science could be misused or abused for the development
of biological weapons. In view of these concerns, in
November 2009, the United States established guidelines[13]
on responding to the proliferation of biological weapons
and their use by terrorists. The guidelines set out that the
United States would take measures to ensure the thorough


8 With regard to negotiations for reducing the number of nuclear weapons, in December 2017 Russian Foreign Ministry Director of Nonproliferation and Arms Control Mikhail Ulyanov indicated his intent
to discuss with the United States the possibility of extending the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty by fi ve years and stated Russia’s position that all countries with nuclear weapons, not just the
United States and Russia, should participate in future treaties on reducing or restricting nuclear weapons.

extended for one more year, and efforts have continued
to be made to ensure that chemical weapons would not
be used ever again by identifying those responsible for
the use of chemical weapons. This joint investigation
mechanism has specifi ed persons responsible for six
incidents of chemical weapons use in Syria. It has been
reported that four of these are attributed to the Syrian
Army, while the remaining two incidents were initiated
by ISIL.[23, 24]

In particular, the report published in October 2017
fi nds that the Syrian government was responsible for the
use of sarin once again in Khan Sheikhun, Syria in April
2017. This investigative mechanism ended its activities
after the UN Security Council failed to adopt a resolution
to renew its mandate.
Meanwhile, even after this, there continues to be
incidents where chemical weapons were used in Syria, as
suspicions have been pointed out that chemical weapons
were used in Eastern Ghouta in April 2018.[25] In the same
month, the United States, United Kingdom and France
launched missile strikes on chemical weapons related
facilities in Syria after they determined the Assad regime

3 Ballistic Missiles and other missiles


had used chemical weapons.[26]
North Korea is an example of a country that is still
presumed to possess these chemical weapons and which
has not entered into the CWC. In addition, the Tokyo
subway sarin attack in 1995, as well as incidents of
bacillus anthracis being contained in mail items in the
United States in 2001 and that of ricin being contained
in a mail item in February 2004, showed that the threat
of the use of WMDs by terrorists is real and that these
weapons could cause serious damage if used in cities.
Furthermore, the Malaysian police announced that a VX
nerve agent whose production and use are banned by the
CWC was found on the body of Kim Jong-nam who was
assassinated in February 2017.
The United Kingdom criticized Russia over its
highly likely involvement in the use of Novichok, a
military-grade chemical weapon developed by Russia,
in the attack on a former Russian intelligence agent that
occurred in the United Kingdom in March 2018. As
punishment, countries including European countries and
the United States expelled Russian diplomats.

In recent years, along with the threat of ballistic
missiles, analysts have pointed to the threat of cruise
missiles as a weapon which is comparatively easy for
terrorists and other non-state actors to acquire and which
has the potential for proliferation.[27] Because cruise missiles
are cheaper to produce compared to ballistic missiles and
are easy to maintain and train with, many countries either
produce or modify cruise missiles. At the same time, it
is said that cruise missiles have a higher degree of target
accuracy and that they are diffi cult to detect while in
fl ight.[28] Moreover, because they are smaller than ballistic
missiles, cruise missiles can be concealed on a ship to
secretly approach a target, and present a serious threat if
they carry WMDs in their warheads.[29]


Ballistic missiles enable the projection of heavy payloads
over long distances and can be used as a means of
delivering WMDs, such as nuclear, biological, and
chemical weapons. Once launched, ballistic missiles
follow an orbital fl ight trajectory and fall at a steep angle
at high speed. As such, effectively countering them
requires a highly accurate interceptor missile system.
The deployment of ballistic missiles in a region where
armed confl ict is under way runs the risk of intensifying
or expanding the confl ict. Additionally, it has the risk of
further heightening tension in a region where military
confrontation is ongoing, leading to the destabilization of
that region. Furthermore, ballistic missiles are used as a
means of attacking from a distance or threatening another
country that has superior conventional forces.


23 See Part I, Chapter 3, Section 1 for ISIL.

24 In a report by the joint investigation mechanism (JIM) involving the UN and OPCW, it was determined that the Syrian Government used chlorine gas in Talmenes (April 2014), in Sarmin (March 2015),
and in Qmenas (March 2015), and also used sarin in Khan Sheikhun (April 2017). The report also found that ISIL used mustard gas in Marea (August 2015) and in Umm Hawsh (September 2016).
The U.S. Director of National Intelligence’s “Worldwide Threat Assessment” of February 2016 referred to ISIL’s contribution to this incident, and assessed that non-state actors are using chemicals in
warfare in Syria.

25 The draft Security Council resolution to establish a UN independent investigative mechanism for identifying users of chemical weapons, proposed by the United States on April 10, 2018, was vetoed
by Russia.

26 See Part I, Chapter 3, Section 1-3 for general information about the Syria situation, including military actions taken by the United States, United Kingdom and France.

27 In the July 2006 confl ict between Israel and Lebanon, it is believed that Hezbollah used a cruise missile to attack an Israeli naval vessel. Israel announced in March 2011 that it had uncovered six
anti-ship cruise missiles among other items on cargo ships subject to inspection.

4 Growing Concerns about Transfer and Proliferation of WMDs and Other Technologies


Even weapons that were purchased or developed for
self-defense purposes could easily be exported or
transferred once domestic manufacturing becomes
successful. For example, certain states that do not heed
political risks have transferred WMDs and related
technologies to other states that cannot afford to invest
resources in conventional forces and attempt to offset
this with WMDs. Some of these states that seek WMDs
do not hesitate to put their land and people at risk, and
furthermore, due to their weak governance, terrorist
organizations are active in their countries. Therefore, it
is conceivable that in general, the possibility of actual
use of WMDs would increase.
Moreover, since it is uncertain whether such states can
effectively manage the related technology and materials,
there is a concern that chemical or nuclear substances
will be transferred or smuggled out from these states with
high likelihood. For example, there is a danger that even
terrorists who do not possess related technologies would
use a dirty bomb[30] as a means of terrorist attack so long as
they gain access to radioactive materials. Nations across
the world share concerns regarding the acquisition and
use of WMDs by terrorists and other non-state actors.[31]
The proliferation of WMDs and other related
technologies has been noted in numerous instances.
For example, in February 2004, it came to light that
nuclear-related technologies, mainly uranium enrichment
technology, had been transferred to North Korea, Iran, and
Libya by Dr. A.Q. Khan and other scientists in Pakistan.
It has also been suggested that North Korea supported
Syria’s secret nuclear activities.[32]
Furthermore, there has been signifi cant transfer and
proliferation of ballistic missiles that serve as the means
of delivery of WMDs. The former Soviet Union and


other countries exported Scud-Bs to many countries and
regions, including Iraq, North Korea, and Afghanistan.
China and North Korea also exported DF-3 (CSS-2) and
Scud missiles, respectively. As a result, a considerable
number of countries now possess ballistic missiles. In
addition, Pakistan’s Ghauri and Iran’s Shahab-3 missiles
are believed to be based on North Korea’s Nodong
missiles. Further still, it has been suggested that North
Korea conducted ballistic missile-related trade with Syria
and Myanmar.[33]
North Korea has made rapid strides in the
development of its ballistic missiles with only a few
test launches. It is believed that an underlying factor of
this fact was North Korea’s imports of various materials
and technologies from outside of the country. It is also
noted that North Korea transfers and proliferates ballistic
missile airframes and related technologies, and that it
promotes the further development of missiles using funds
procured by such transfer and proliferation.[34] Some also
point out that North Korea conducts ballistic missile tests
at its export destination and make use of its results.
The international community’s uncompromising and
decisive stance against the transfer and proliferation of
WMDs and other technologies has put signifi cant pressure
on countries engaged in related activities, leading some of
them to accept inspections by international organizations
or abandon their WMD and other programs altogether.[35]
Meanwhile, it is pointed out that, in recent years, states
of proliferation concern have sustained their proliferation
activities by averting international monitoring, through
illicitly exporting WMDs and other technologies
overseas by falsifying documentation, diversifying
transport routes, and utilizing multiple front companies
and intermediaries. Additionally, intangible transfer of


30 Dirty bombs are intended to cause radioactive contamination by spreading radioactive materials.

31 Based on these concerns, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1540 in April 2004, which sets forth the decision that all UN member states would refrain from providing support to non-state
actors that attempt to develop, acquire, manufacture, possess, transport, transfer, or use WMDs and their means of delivery, as well as adopt and enforce laws that are appropriate and effective for
prohibiting these activities. The International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism also entered into force in July 2007.

32 DNI “Worldwide Threat Assessment” from January 2014 states, “North Korea’s assistance to Syria in the construction of a nuclear reactor (destroyed in 2007) illustrates the reach of the North’s
proliferation activities.” The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report of May 2011 states that the destroyed reactor was very likely a nuclear reactor that Syria should have declared to
the IAEA.

33 The March 2018 report of the Panel of Experts of the UN Security Council Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) Sanctions Committee points out the activities of North Korean ballistic missile
technicians in Syria and the transfer to Syria of special tiles used at chemical weapons manufacturing facilities. It also discusses North Korea’s ongoing military relationship with Myanmar, including
ballistic missile systems.

34 In addition, concerning the proliferation of WMDs and ballistic missiles by North Korea, the “Worldwide Threat Assessment” of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence of January 2014 pointed out
that “North Korea’s export of ballistic missiles and associated materials to several countries, including Iran and Syria, and its assistance to Syria’s construction of a nuclear reactor, destroyed in 2007,
illustrate the reach of its proliferation activities.” Moreover, in the report entitled “Military and Security Developments Involving the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,” which was published by
the U.S. DoD in March 2014, it was pointed out that North Korea uses various techniques to circumvent measures taken by each country on the basis of UN Security Council resolutions, including
sending cargo through multiple front companies and intermediaries.

35 Extensive behind-the-scenes negotiations began in March 2003 among Libya, the United States and the United Kingdom. In December 2003, Libya agreed to dismantle all of its WMDs and to accept
inspections by an international organization. Later, in August 2006, Libya ratifi ed the IAEA Additional Protocol. Meanwhile, after the military campaign against Libya by a multinational force, in March

other measures, in exchange for ending the sanctions of
previous UN Security Council resolutions and the U.S.
and EU’s nuclear-related sanctions.[38]
The JCPOA reached its adoption date on October
18, 2015, 90 days after the Security Council resolution
was adopted. On January 16, 2016, the IAEA released
a report confi rming Iran’s completion of the necessary
preparatory steps to start the implementation of the
JCPOA. Accordingly, the United States suspended
its nuclear-related sanctions against Iran. In addition,
the EU terminated some of its sanctions, and the
sanctions imposed by previous UN Security Council
resolutions concerning the nuclear issues of Iran ended,
in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution
2231. Subsequently, the IAEA has repeatedly confi rmed
that Iran is complying with the agreement. However in
May 2018 President Trump stated that with the current
agreement, Iran can still be on the verge of a nuclear
breakout in a short period of time even if Iran fully
complies with the agreement, and also the agreement
fails to address Iran’s development of ballistic missiles.
He then announced that the United States will withdraw
from the agreement and start work aimed at re-imposing
sanctions. President Trump has said he will work with
allies to fi nd a real, comprehensive and lasting solution
to Iran’s nuclear threat. Thus, the future moves of the
United States will be closely monitored.


The nuclear issues of Iran are a serious challenge to
the international non-proliferation regime. In 2002, it
was revealed that Iran, without notifying the IAEA, had
been engaged for a long time in uranium enrichment and
other activities potentially leading to the development of
nuclear weapons. Since 2003, Iran has continued with its
uranium enrichment activities despite resolutions adopted
by the IAEA Board and the UN Security Council urging
Iran to stop its uranium enrichment and other activities.
However, with Hassan Rouhani winning the
presidential election in Iran in June 2013, the discussions
with the E3+3 (U.K., France, Germany, U.S., China, and
Russia) were advanced, resulting in the announcement
of the Joint Plan of Action (JPOA) towards the
comprehensive resolution of nuclear issues in November
2013. The execution of the fi rst step measures of the
JPOA commenced in January 2014.[37]
On April 2, 2015, consultations held in Lausanne,
Switzerland resulted in an agreement regarding the key
parameters of the fi nal agreement. On July 14, 2015, the
fi nal agreement concerning the nuclear issues of Iran,
the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was
announced in Vienna. Following this, on July 20, 2015,
UN Security Council Resolution 2231 approving the
JCPOA was adopted. In the agreement, it was decided
that Iran would reduce its enriched uranium stockpile and
number of centrifuges, ban the production of weapons
grade plutonium, and accept IAEA inspections, among


36 The February 2016 report of the Panel of Experts of the UN Security Council DPRK Sanctions Committee states that over the past 20 years since 1996, North Korea has dispatched more than 30
engineers to the Centre for Space Science and Technology Education in Asia and the Pacifi c, which receives technical support from the UN Offi ce for Outer Space Affairs. These engineers participate
in research programs concerning topics such as satellite communications, space science and atmospheric chemistry, and satellite navigation systems. The report notes that such knowhow regarding
space science and satellite systems contributes to improving North Korea’s ballistic missile technology.

37 First step measures include the limited relaxation of sanctions by the E3+3, provided that for six months, Iran: (1) retains half of its existing uranium enriched to approximately 20% as oxide and dilutes
the remaining half to less than 5%; (2) does not enrich uranium over 5%; (3) does not advance activities at uranium enrichment facilities and heavy water reactors; (4) accepts enhanced monitoring
by the IAEA.

38 The major nuclear-related restrictions on Iran in the JCPOA include the following: with regard to uranium enrichment, limiting the number of centrifuges for uranium enrichment to 5,060 or less,
keeping the level of uranium enrichment at up to 3.67%, and restricting Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile to 300 kg; and with regard to plutonium production, redesigning and rebuilding the Arak
heavy water reactor to not produce weapons grade plutonium and shipping spent fuel out of Iran, and not engaging in reprocessing spent fuel including R&D and not constructing reprocessing
facilities. According to then U.S. Secretary of State Kerry, with this agreement Iran’s breakout time (the time it takes to manufacture nuclear fuel for a single nuclear weapon) will be extended from
90 days or less before the JCPOA to a year or more. Furthermore, the JCPOA is an agreement pertaining to nuclear issues and does not suspend or lift sanctions related to international terrorism,
missiles, human rights, among other issues. In response, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, in his address to the UN General Assembly in October 2015, strongly criticized the Iranian
nuclear agreement for making war more likely. In the United States, while the Republican Party that makes up the majority of Congress had been opposed to the agreement, the motion of disapproval

**Section 3 Maritime Trends**


Maritime security is of critical importance to Japan,
a maritime nation surrounded by sea. For example,
Japan relies on sea transport to import energy resources.
Accordingly, ensuring secure sea lanes is vital for the
survival of the nation. Securing the stable use of one


of the global commons, the “maritime domain,” is a
key security issue for the international community. In
recent years, maritime trends in the countries concerned
are drawing attention, including their compliance with
relevant international norms.


1 Trends Related to the “Principle of the Freedom of the High Seas” in the East and South China Seas


The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)[1]
provides for the principles of freedom of navigation in the high
seas and freedom of over fl ight. Nevertheless, in the waters
and airspace in the periphery of Japan, especially the East
and South China Seas, it has become increasingly common
for countries to unilaterally assert their rights or take actions,
based on their unique assertions which are incompatible with
the existing international order. This has caused situations of
undue infringement upon such principles.
Numerous cases of acts which go against the
principles of freedom of navigation and freedom of
overfl ight have been recently seen in the East China Sea.
For example, there was the case in January 2013,when a
Chinese naval vessel directed its fi re-control radar at an
MSDF destroyer navigating on the high seas (30th), and
another case in which a Chinese naval vessel is suspected
to have directed its fi re-control radar at a helicopter
carried onboard an MSDF destroyer (19th). The directing
of a fi re-control radar is generally an act carried out prior
to using fi rearms, and directing it at an opponent is a
dangerous act that may have unintended consequences.[2]

On November 23, 2013, the Chinese Government
declared “the East China Sea Air Defense Identifi cation
Zone (ADIZ)” including the Senkaku Islands as if they
were a part of China’s “territory.” China’s Ministry of
National Defense announced that it would enforce rules
it set on any aircraft fl ying in the ADIZ and that the PLA
would take “defensive emergency measures” if aircraft


does not follow the instructed procedures. Japan is deeply
concerned about such measures, which are profoundly
dangerous acts that unilaterally change the status quo in
the East China Sea, escalating the situation, and that may
cause unintended consequences in the East China Sea.
Furthermore, the measures unduly infringe the freedom
of over fl ight. Japan is demanding China to revoke any
measures that could go against the principle of freedom
of over fl ight. The United States, the Republic of Korea
(ROK), Australia, and the EU, too, have expressed
concern about China’s establishment of such zone.
Increased activities by Chinese military aircraft have
been confi rmed in recent years in the airspace close to the
various southwestern islands of Japan, including the main
island of Okinawa, and the expansion of these activities
may be an attempt to enforce “the East China Sea Air
Defense Identifi cation Zone (ADIZ).” Moreover, in May
and June of 2014, fi ghters of the People’s Liberation
Army (PLA) of China fl ew abnormally close to aircraft
of the MSDF and Japan Air Self-Defense Force, which
were fl ying over the East China Sea.[3]

Such actions have also been seen frequently in the
South China Sea. Chinese naval vessels have obstructed
the navigation of U.S. naval vessels[4] and Chinese aircraft
have also obstructed the fl ight of U.S. military aircraft.[5]
In December 2016, an unmanned underwater vehicle
belonging to the U.S. Navy was momentarily seized in
the South China Sea by a vessel of the PLA Navy. These


The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) was adopted as a comprehensive treaty on the law and order of the seas in 1982 and entered into force in 1994 (Japan concluded it in 1996).

Regarding this issue, the U.S. issued statements saying “actions such as this escalate tensions and increase the risk of an incident or a miscalculation, and they could undermine peace, stability, and
economic growth in this vital region (February 5, 2013, Department of State Daily Press Briefi ng)” and that “we were briefed by our Japanese allies on the incident and we’ve satisfi ed ourselves that
it does appear to have happened (February 11, 2013, Department of State Daily Press Briefi ng).”

Other than that, there were multiple incidents in March 2011 of Chinese helicopters and other aircraft apparently of the State Oceanic Administration fl ying close to Japan Maritime Self-Defense
Force destroyers which were engaged in monitoring and surveillance in the East China Sea. Moreover, in June 2016, a Chinese fi ghter is speculated to have conducted a dangerous act by
approaching a U.S. Air Force reconnaissance aircraft at a high speed over the East China Sea, and in May 2017 an incident allegedly occurred where Chinese fi ghters obstructed the route of an
aircraft of the U.S. Forces.

In March 2009, Chinese ships, including a naval vessel, a maritime research ship of the SOA, a Bureau of Maritime Fisheries’ patrol ship, and fi shing vessels, approached a U.S. Navy acoustic research
ship operating in the South China Sea to obstruct its operations, while in December 2013, a Chinese naval vessel cut across the bow of a U.S. Navy cruiser operating in the South China Sea at point
blank range.

In August 2014, a Chinese fi ghter is speculated to have fl own abnormally close to and obstructed a U.S. Navy patrol aircraft over the South China Sea. Furthermore, in May 2016, Chinese fi ghters

cases are dangerous acts that could cause unintended
consequences.
Additionally, China has gone ahead with land
reclamation on seven features on a massive and rapid
scale on the Spratly Islands since 2014. In July 2016,
the rights asserted by China in the sea area enclosed
by the “nine-dash line,” including “historical rights”
as the basis of the “nine dash line” were denied in the
arbitration award between the Philippines and China,
and the illegality of China’s reclamation activities was
acknowledged. However, China has clearly stated its
intention not to comply with the award, and continues
militarization of the features by developing batteries
and other military facilities and various infrastructure
that can be used for military purposes, such as runways,
harbors, hangars and radar facilities. Moreover, in July
and August 2016 after the arbitration award between the
Philippines and China was rendered, an H-6 bomber of
the PLAAF conducted combat air patrols in the airspace
around Scarborough Shoal, with China’s Ministry of
National Defense announcing that it would conduct these
patrols regularly from now on. This shows the PLA has
been intensifying its operation in the South China Sea.
Under these circumstances, a further increase in China’s
aerial presence in the area could lead to the establishment
of a “South China Sea Air Defense Identifi cation Zone”
in the future.
Furthermore, Chinese government vessels have
obstructed fi shing and other vessels of countries
approaching the features, etc. by ring warning shots and
water cannons at the vessels. Claimants as well as the
international community including the United States have
repeatedly said they are deeply concerned about China’s
unilateral changes of the status quo, further advancement
of efforts to create a fait accompli, and assertive and
dangerous acts that could cause unintended consequences.
Despite these numerous acts that could pose risks to
securing the stable use of oceans and airspace, in recent
years progress has been made on efforts to avert and

2 Trends in the Arctic Ocean


prevent unintended consequences in the seas and skies.
First, at the Japan-China Summit Meeting held on May 9,
2018, Japan and China agreed to establish a “Maritime and
Aerial Communication Mechanism between Japan-China
Defense Authorities” with the aim of avoiding unintended
confrontations between the naval vessels and aircraft
of the SDF and PLA. As for multi-national initiatives,
in April 2014, navies of participating countries of the
Western Pacifi c Naval Symposium (WPNS), including
Japan, the United States, and China, reached agreement
on the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES).[6]
CUES sets forth a code of conduct such as procedures and
communication method to ensure safety for unexpected
encounters by vessels or aircraft of the navies of each
country. In November 2014, the United States and China
agreed on measures pertaining to mutual notifi cation
of military activities, together with rules of behavior to
avert collisions in waters and airspace in accordance with
CUES and other frameworks. In September 2015, the two
countries announced an agreement concerning an additional
annex stipulating rules of behavior to avert air encounters.
Between ASEAN and China, offi cial discussions have
been held between on the establishment of the Code of the
Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (COC).
It is strongly hoped that these initiatives designed
to avert and prevent unintended consequences in the
seas and skies will supplement the existing international
order, and that the countries concerned, including China,
refrain from unilateral actions that heighten tension and
act on the basis of the principle of the rule of law.
Moreover, to ensure the effectiveness of the UN
Security Council Resolution regarding the North Korea
issue, the international community has been cooperating
in the bolstering of measures to prevent the evasion of
sanctions by North Korea, including ship-to-ship transfers
of goods (the offshore transfer of goods from or to ships
registered to North Korea), which has been prohibited by
the UN Security Council Resolution.[7]

For these reasons, the Arctic states have been more

See Part III, Chapter 1, Section 2-1-1

The Arctic Region is the area north of the latitude line of 66 degrees 33 minutes north latitude. There are eight countries in the Arctic Region – the fi ve countries that border the Arctic Ocean and
Finland, Sweden, and Iceland that do not border it. In 1996, the Arctic Council was established, which aims to promote cooperation, coordination, and interaction among the Arctic states, with the

proactively promoting efforts to secure their interests in
resource development and use of the sea route. From the
perspective of security, the Arctic Ocean has traditionally
been used for the deployment of strategic nuclear forces
and as their transit route. With the decrease in sea ice
in recent years, ships have been able to navigate for a
longer period of time and more extensively than before.
It is therefore considered that the region could be used
for deploying maritime forces or maneuvering military
forces in the future, increasing its strategic importance.
In this situation, there are unresolved issues among
the Arctic states over the demarcation of maritime
boundaries based on UNCLOS and extension of the
continental shelf. Some of these Arctic states including
Russia are promoting efforts to deploy new military
capabilities for the purpose of securing their interests and
defending their territories.
In the Russian Federation’s National Security Strategy
revised in December 2015, Russia continues to maintain
that it would secure its interests in resource development
and use of the sea route. Russia has been actively involved
with the Arctic, underpinned by Russia’s possession of
the largest exclusive economic zone (EEZ) among the
coastal states, the potential abundance of resources in the
waters of the Arctic Ocean, the geographic and security
importance of the Northern Sea Route located off the
coast of Russia, and Russia’s military superiority ensured
by the deployment of military forces directly facing the
Arctic Ocean.[9]

3 Maritime Security Efforts of Countries


In the Arctic Strategy released by the U.S. DoD in
2013, the United States expresses its desire for the Arctic
to become a secure and stable region where U.S. national
interests are safeguarded, the U.S. homeland is protected,
and nations work cooperatively to address challenges.
In December 2016, then U.S. President Obama decided
to ban new drilling for oil and natural gas in a majority
of U.S. territorial waters in the Arctic to protect marine
resources, showing a negative stance towards resource
development. However, the U.S. President Trump signed
an executive order repealing this decision of then U.S.
President Obama in April 2017.[10]
Aside from coastal states in the Arctic Ocean, 13
countries including Japan and China have observer status
in the Arctic Council. Notably, China has shown active
involvement in the Arctic Ocean, deploying the polar
research vessel Xue Long to the Arctic Ocean for eight
times since 1999.[11] In January 2018, they published a
white paper titled “China’s Arctic Policy ” in which
they claimed to be one of the geographically closest
states to the Arctic Circle with rights pertaining to the
development of resources. They also announced their
intention to build a “Polar Silk Road.” In September 2015,
it was reported for the fi rst time that fi ve Chinese naval
vessels sailed in the Bering Sea between the Arctic Ocean
and the Pacifi c and sailed in the U.S. territorial waters near
the Alewtian Islands. Focus will be on whether or not such
activities would have any relation to the PLA Navy’s future
advancements into the Arctic Ocean.

prosperity of the international community as a whole. In
this regard, each state has been tackling on its own or with
others various issues including piracy, unidentifi ed vessels,
illegal dumping, contraband, human smuggling, maritime
disasters, and the removal of hazardous substances, for
maintaining the stability of sea lanes of communication.


With regard to oceans, not only for economic development
but also for the national security of each country, it has
become even more important to promote appropriate
rulemaking and to make concerted efforts by the
international community to address risks and ensure
freedom of navigation while respecting such rules.
“Open and Stable Seas” constitute the basis for peace and


9 Russia is said to have a fl eet of around 40 icebreakers, while an additional three nuclear-powered icebreakers and two multipurpose icebreaker patrol ships are currently under construction. See
Chapter 2, Section 4 (Russia) regarding the Northern Joint Strategic Command in charge of the Arctic, the deployment and training of the Northern Fleet vessels, the development of military facilities,
strategic patrols by strategic nuclear submarines, and patrol fl ights by long-range bombers.

10 As regards activities of other coastal nations, Canada states that the Arctic is a priority region under its policies in Canada’s Northern Strategy (released in 2009), and similar to the United States,
in December 2016 Canada announced a moratorium on the development of oil and natural gas in its territorial waters in the Arctic Ocean. Denmark and Norway have also developed the Kingdom
of Denmark Strategy for the Arctic 2011-2020 (released in 2011) and the Norwegian Government’s High North Strategy (released in 2006), respectively, which outline their stances of attaching
importance to the Arctic, including the perspective of security.

11 In 2012, Xue Long became the fi rst polar research vessel to sail across the Arctic Ocean. In 2013, a cargo vessel Yong Sheng became the fi rst Chinese commercial ship to cross the Arctic Ocean.
Canadian scientists took part in Xue Long’s voyage to the Arctic Ocean in 2017, and they succeeded for the fi rst time in trial navigation of the Arctic Northwest Passage (along the north coast of

1 United States


Regarding China’s maritime advances, U.S. Secretary of
Defense Mattis declared at the Shangri-La Dialog, held
in June 2017, that the United States cannot and will not
accept unilateral coercive changes to the status quo due
to the scope and scale of China’s construction activities
in the South China Sea, which differ from those of other
countries in several key ways. They include the nature of
its militarization, China’s disregard for international law,
its contempt for other nations’ interests, and its efforts to
dismiss non-adversarial resolution of the issues. In stating
this, he also stated that the U.S. remains committed to
protecting the rights, freedom and lawful uses of the sea,
and the ability of countries to exercise those rights in
the strategically important East and South China Seas.
Moreover, he stated that the U.S. will continue to fl y,
sail and operate wherever international law allows, and
demonstrate resolve through operational presence in
the South China Sea and beyond. In May, July, August
and October of 2017, and January, March and May
of 2018, it has been reported that the U.S. military
actually conducted Freedom of Navigation operations,
navigating vessels in surrounding waters and within 12
nautical miles of maritime features in the South China
Sea claimed by China.[12] Japan supports these Freedom
of Navigation operations conducted in the South China
Sea by the United States, and believes in the importance
of cooperation within the international community to
protect the free, open and peaceful seas.
The United States deems that its safety and economic
security depend upon the secure use of the world’s
oceans, and that the United States has a vital interest in
maritime security. Based on this recognition, the United
States leads the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF)[13] to
counter piracy and advance maritime safety, including
tackling terrorism in waters surrounding the Middle
East and Africa, such as the Gulf of Aden, the Persian
Gulf, and the Indian Ocean. In waters surrounding
Central America, the United States conducts operations
to counter illicit traffi cking, primarily drug traffi cking
with European and Western Hemisphere countries.[14] The
United States thus dispatches vessels to the various sea


2 NATO • EU


NATO, which identifi es acts of terrorism as a threat to
its member countries, has conducted Operation Active
Endeavour as a maritime initiative since October 2001
following the terrorist attacks in the United States of the
same year. Regarding this operation, a decision was made
to transition to Operation Sea Guardian, whose mission
is crisis management, and a wide range of operations
has been carried out since November 2016, including
counter-terrorism and capacity building assistance,
among others, while collaborating with Operation Sophia
of the European Union (EU).
To deal with the pending issue of the large infl ux
of refugees and migrants, NATO decided to deploy the
Standing NATO Maritime Groups, which is multinational,
integrated force made up of vessels from member
countries that provide offshore deterrence for member
countries through routine exercises and maintenance
of rapid deployment capabilities, to the Aegean Sea in
February 2016, and notify Greek and Turkish authorities
as well as the European Agency for the Management
of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of
the Member States of the EU of information regarding
refugee boats.
In response to the threat of piracy, NATO was
deploying vessels of the Standing NATO Maritime
Groups to off the coast of Somalia and the Gulf of
Aden. NATO was carrying out Operation Ocean Shield
since August 2009, and it engaged in counter-piracy
activities by vessels as well as helped countries build
up their capacities to counter piracy if requested. NATO
ended these activities in December 2016. With many
of its member states facing the ocean, the EU has high
maritime traffi c and economic activity in the sea, and
since December 2008, it has conducted the counterpiracy operation known as Operation Atalanta in this
area, which became the EU’s fi rst maritime mission. This
operation aims to monitor the waters around the area and


12 The Freedom of Navigation Operations are operational activities conducted by the U.S. Forces for countering excessive claims over maritime interests asserted by coastal states to protect the rights,

5 Australia


Australia’s Defence White Paper unveiled in 2016 considers
the security of sea lanes as a strategic defense interest, along
with the security and resilience of Australia. Especially as
Australia depends on maritime trade with Southeast Asia
and maritime trade transiting Southeast Asia, Australia sees
a need to ensure the security of trade routes in the country’s
proximate waters and in Southeast Asia.
Based on this policy, the Australian Defence Force
(ADF) has a outpost in Royal Malaysian Air Force
(RMAF) Base Butterworth and conducts patrol and
surveillance activities called “Operation Gateway” using
patrol aircraft in the North Indian Ocean and the South
China Sea.[17] The ADF also engages in expanding naval
cooperation with India, providing patrol vessels to South
Pacifi c countries,[18] and conducting coastal patrols by
mobilizing ADF assets.
In relation to China, there were reports of Australian
patrol aircraft operating in the area around the South
China Sea being subjected to PLA aircraft interference
on a regular basis. Moreover, there were reports in April
2018 of three Australian naval vessels heading toward
Vietnam being provoked by the PLA Navy. In response
to this, the Ministry of National Defense of The People’s
Republic of China stated that the “reports were not true,”
while Australian Prime Minister Turnbull declared that
Australia will exert and practice its right of freedom of
navigation throughout the world’s oceans, including
South China Sea.

6 China


China relies on sea transport for over 90% of its trade
cargo.[19] Accordingly, ensuring the security of China’s sea
lanes constitutes a critical part of the “basic safeguards for
ensuring sustainable economic and social development,”[20]
one of China’s “core interests.”
With regard to counter-piracy activities, as a member
of the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating
Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia
(ReCAAP),[21] China shares information and participates


3 United Kingdom


The United Kingdom is an island nation surrounded by
sea, and has a heritage of engaging actively in maritime
activities, including maritime trade. Furthermore, the
United Kingdom has many overseas territories and
has an EEZ which extends about 25 times the U.K.
terrestrial extent. Due to these factors, the United
Kingdom proactively contributes to NATO-and EU-led
multinational forces and the U.S. led CMF in order to
ensure the maritime security of the sea areas surrounding
the United Kingdom, including its overseas territories,
and by extension, the seas of its neighboring countries.
Specifi cally, the headquarters of Operation Atalanta,
the EU-led counter-piracy operation is located at the
Northwood Maritime Command Headquarters in the
U.K. In addition, the U.K. navy engages in initiatives to
maintain a presence in the Asia-Pacifi c region, in order to
ensure freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.[15]

4 France


France, with its many overseas territories, possesses one
of the largest EEZs in the world. The strategic review
announced in October 2017, pointed out the possibility
of the benefi ts of freedom of navigation being threatened
as the result of deterioration in the strategic situation in
the Asia-Pacifi c region, and simultaneously clarifi ed the
country’s intention to continue protecting its overseas
sovereignty and overseas territories in the Pacifi c and
Indian Oceans. As such, France has deployed forces
in French Polynesia and New Caledonia, including the
deployment of frigates and patrol boats. Moreover, the
Floréal-class frigate, Vendémiaire, made a port call in
Japan in February 2018 to hold joint exercises with the
Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF). France has also
been hosting multilateral exercises such as Croix du Sud
and Equateur in the South Pacifi c.[16]


15 See Chapter 2, Section 8-3-1

16 See Chapter 2, Section 8-3-2 for more information about French ships calling on ports and France’s involvement in exercises. As for humanitarian assistance activities, France carried out activities
in the Philippines, Vanuatu, and Fiji following the damaging typhoons and cyclones that struck these countries in November 2013, March 2015, and February 2016.

17 In December 2015, the Australian Department of Defence admitted that as part of these activities, Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) aircraft conducted patrol activities in the South China Sea from
November to December. This was preceded by BBC’s release of the content of the radio communications that allegedly took place between RAAF aircraft and the PLA Navy, claiming that Australia
was carrying out “freedom of navigation” fl ights in the South China Sea.

18 See chapter 2, Section 5-3-4

19 According to the website of the Central People’s Government of China, over 90% of China’s export and import cargo, such as crude oil, iron ore, food, and container, are transported by sea.

in cooperative arrangements related to piracy in Southeast
Asia. Since December 2008, China has deployed naval
vessels to off the coast of Somalia and the Gulf of Aden
and has been involved in international efforts to repress
piracy. Through such activities, China has contributed to
ensuring maritime security. Commitment to ensuring the
security of its sea lanes is also considered to be connected
to the PLA Navy’s objective of building up capacity for
continuous operations in more distant waters. In this
respect, since August 2017, China has begun operating
a security base for providing support for the activities
of the PLA in Djibouti, a strategic key point in East
Africa facing the Gulf of Aden, where the PLA Navy’s
vessels involved in counter-piracy activities return to.
The objective of these overseas bases, including ports, is
believed to be to build up China’s capacity for continuous
operations in more distant waters.
Meanwhile, in the South China Sea, China and
ASEAN member states have confl icting assertions over
the sovereignty of such areas as the Spratly Islands and the
Paracel Islands. In recent years, the countries concerned,
including China, have stepped up their activities to assert
their sovereignty. Developments associated with the
freedom of navigation in the sea have been subject to
increasing international concern.

7 Southeast Asia


Southeast Asia is located at the crossroads of traffi c,
linking the Pacifi c and the Indian Oceans, such as the
Straits of Malacca and the South China Sea. This region,
however, has maritime security issues, including disputes
over the sovereignty of the South China Sea and piracy.
In 2002, ASEAN and China signed the Declaration


on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC)
aimed at peacefully settling the issues over the South
China Sea. Currently, offi cial consultations have been
held with a view to establishing the COC, which is
deemed to contain more specifi c content than the DOC
and to be legally binding.
Furthermore, there have been developments related
to settling issues through arbitral proceedings set out in
UNCLOS. In January 2013, the Philippines instituted
arbitral proceedings pursuant to UNCLOS for the dispute
between the Philippines and China over its assertions
and actions in the South China Sea. In July 2016, a fi nal
award was rendered in which nearly all of the Philippines’
submissions were ruled in favor of the Philippines. This
award will be fi nal and legally binding on both parties.
Moreover, Vietnam, another claimant, has requested the
tribunal to take into consideration Vietnam’s assertions
over the South China Sea. In this regard, there has been a
trend among some countries concerned to work towards
a peaceful solution of the issue in accordance with
international law.
With regard to counter-piracy measures, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand conduct the Malacca
Strait Patrols.[22] Efforts have also been under way to share
information related to piracy and build a cooperation
arrangement in accordance with ReCAAP. Additionally,
in recent years, the cases of abduction for ransom has
been confi rmed in the Sulu Sea and the Celebes Sea.
In order to respond to this, Indonesia, Malaysia and the
Philippines began sea patrols in the area in June 2017,
and air patrols in October of the same year.

[See] Chapter 2, Section 6- 4 (Trends concerning Sovereignty and

Other Issues over the South China Sea)


22 The Malacca Strait Patrols are comprised of: the Malacca Strait Sea Patrols which commenced in 2004; aircraft patrol activities which commenced in 2005; and information sharing activities which

**Section 4 Outer Space and Security**


1 Outer Space and Security

Nearly 60 years have passed since a satellite was launched
into outer space for the fi rst time in the history of mankind.
In recent years, technology leveraging outer space has
been applied to various areas. No state is allowed to own
outer space, and it is freely available to all nations. Major
countries thus make proactive efforts to use outer space.[1]
For example, observation satellites such as meteorological
satellites are used to observe weather as well as land and
waters; communication and broadcasting satellites are
used for the Internet and broadcasting; and positioning
satellites are used to navigate aircraft and ships. These
satellites have widely prevailed in social, economic,
scientifi c, and other areas as essential infrastructure for
the public and private sectors.
In the security fi eld, military forces in major countries
are actively involved in outer space activities and utilize
a variety of satellites. There is no concept of national
borders in outer space, meaning that the utilization of
satellites enables the observation of, communication
at, and positioning on any area on Earth. Thus, major
countries make efforts to enhance the capabilities of
a variety of satellites and launch them for the purpose
of enhancing C4ISR functions.[2] Such satellites include
imagery reconnaissance satellites reconnoitering military
facilities and targets, early warning satellites that detect
the launch of ballistic missiles, satellites gathering
radio wave information for military communications,
communication satellites for military communication,
and positioning satellites for navigating naval vessels and
aircraft and enhancing the precision of weapons systems.
In outer space, the various countries are also rapidly
developing their capabilities to ensure their military
superiority. As various countries launch military satellites,
China conducted a test to destroy its aging satellite with
a ground-launched missile. The resulting space debris[3]


spread across the satellite’s orbit, and came to be seen as
a threat against space assets such as satellites owned by
countries.[4] Furthermore, countries including China and
Russia are thought to be also developing anti-satellite
weapons (ASAT) that do not directly hit and destroy a
satellite by a missile, thus creating less space debris.
For example, it has been noted that ASATs under
development include an ASAT that brings a “killer
satellite” to maneuver itself close to target and utilize a
robot arm to capture it to disable its functions. In this area,
China has carried out experiments in outer space in which
they have mobilized satellites close to other satellites to
simulate the movements of a killer satellite. It has been
noted that Russia too, has launched killer satellites.[5]
Furthermore, it has been pointed out that both China and
Russia are developing ASATs that disable the functions
of the target satellite by using a jammer to interfere with
communications between the target satellite and the
ground station.
As the above illustrates, the risk to the stable use
of outer space has become one of the critical security
challenges for countries, thus it has become necessary
to deal with this risk effectively in an effort to ensure
stability in the use of outer space.
Against this backdrop, the existing framework such
as the Outer Space Treaty (The Treaty on Principles
Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration
and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other
Celestial Bodies) that prescribes the exploration and use
of outer space, do not have provisions on prohibiting the
destruction of space objects and refraining from actions
triggering space debris. International efforts have been
under way recently for the creation of the International
Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities and the
guidelines for “Long-term Sustainability of Outer Space


The Outer Space Treaty (The Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies) that came into force in
October 1967 defi nes such matters as the use of the Moon and other celestial bodies for peaceful purposes, the freedom in principle of exploration and use of outer space, and the prohibition of
ownership. However, no clear international agreement has been reached on the defi nition of outer space, though according to one of the concepts, outer space is considered space located 100 km
or further away from the Earth’s surface.

The term “C4ISR” stands for command, control, communication, computer, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. The 1991 Gulf War is considered “the fi rst high-tech war conducted in outer
space in the history of mankind.”

Unnecessary artifacts orbiting around the Earth, including satellites no longer in use, upper stages parts, and fragments of launch vehicles.

According to an April 2018 issue of the Washington Times (National Digital Edition) of the U.S., Russia carried out an experimental launch of an anti-satellite missile in March 2018. Moreover, it was
noted that China also carried out an experimental launch of an anti-satellite missile in February 2018.

solar activity with a potential impact on satellites and
electronic equipment on Earth, and threats caused by


meteors reaching Earth, in addition to threats posed by
anti-satellite weapons and space debris to space assets.

2 Trends in the Use of Space by Countries for Security Objectives


that the United States needs to prepare for the possibility
of confl ict extending into outer space.
From an organizational perspective, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is
responsible for non-military space development in
the United States, while the U.S. DoD works on space
development from national security perspective, and
the Joint Force Space Component Command under the
control of the U.S. Strategic Command oversees the
activities in space from a military perspective.
Major satellites used for military purposes include
satellites for imagery reconnaissance, early warning,
electronic / signals intelligence, communication, and
global positioning, and their operations are wide-ranging.

2 Russia


Russia’s space activities have been continuing since
the former Soviet Union era. The former Soviet Union
successively launched multiple satellites after it launched
the fi rst satellite in the history of mankind, Sputnik 1, in
October 1957, and had the largest number of launched
satellites in the world until the collapse of the former
Soviet Union. The satellites included many military
satellites, and progress was made in the use of space
for military purposes by the U.S. and the former Soviet
Union during the Cold War era. Russia’s space activities
have declined since the former Soviet Union collapsed
in 1991. However, the country has recently started to
expand its activities once again.
Regarding the country’s trends in security, the
National Security Strategy of the Russian Federation,
approved in December 2015, states that the U.S.
deployment of weapons into outer space constitutes one of
the factors undermining global and regional stability. The
Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation, a document


1 United States


The United States launched its fi rst satellite, Explorer
1, in January 1958, following the satellite launches by
the former Soviet Union. The country has since then
proceeded with a variety of space activities in fi elds
including military, science, and resource exploration,
such as launching the world’s fi rst reconnaissance satellite
and landing on the Moon. Today, the United States is the
world’s leading space power. The U.S. Forces clearly
recognize the importance of outer space for their actions,
and in this regard, actively utilize outer space for security
purposes. In June 2010, the United States released the
National Space Policy that presents the country’s basic
guidelines for space policy.[7]
The National Security Strategy (NSS) revealed in
December 2017 points out that many countries are said
to have purchased satellites to back up their strategic
military activities, and some countries even pursuing a
variety of ASATs on the basis of belief that the capability
to attack assets in outer space will give them asymmetrical
advantages. But having noted that, the United States
indicated that unlimited access to and freedom in activities
in outer space were vital interests of the United States,
and that the long-term goals in outer space were given
consideration by the newly established National Space
Council (NSpC) in an effort to develop strategies. The
National Space Strategy was announced in March 2018,
which demonstrated its recognition that their adversaries
had turned space into a warfi ghting domain, and that the
United States would seek to deter, counter, and defeat
threats in the space domain that are hostile to the national
interest of the United States and its allies. Based on these
strategic guidelines, the U.S. Department of Defense
(DoD) has set the goal of maintaining and strengthening
U.S. space superiority for security purposes, recognizing


In 2007, the chairperson of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UN COPUOS) proposed to discuss “the long-term sustainability of outer space activities” in relation to civil
space activities, for the purpose of defi ning risk reduction for long-term sustainable activities and equal access to outer space. Based on this proposal, the Scientifi c and Technical Subcommittee of UN
COPUOS set up a working group, which carries out discussions every year for establishing the guidelines. In June 2016, an agreement was reached on a part of the guidelines that included details on the
promotion of gathering and sharing of data information on space debris monitoring. Negotiations are currently being continued with the aim of arriving at an overall agreement within 2018.

In December 2017, a signing ceremony was held for the Space Policy Directive 1, which was the fi rst policy on space to be announced after President Trump’s inauguration. In his speech, he


-----

created in April 2014 to specifi cally defi ne the principles
of the National Security Strategy in the military fi eld,
mentions the development and maintenance of a group of
orbiting spacecraft to support Russia’s military activities
in space as being one of the main missions.
From an organizational perspective, the Roscosmos
State Corporation for Space Activities is in charge
of space activities related to Russia’s scientifi c and
economic areas, while the Russian Ministry of Defence
is involved in space activities for security purposes.
The Russian Aerospace Forces[8] conducts actual space
activities for military purposes, manages facilities for
launching satellites, among other activities.
Major satellites launched by Russia are satellites
for imagery reconnaissance, early warning, radio wave
information gathering, communication, positioning, and
others, all of which are presumed to be used for security
purposes. Currently, Russia is developing a new Angara
carrier launch vehicle,[9] along with building a new launch
site in Vostochny in the Far East.[10]


established the ESA, which launched a satellite in 1979.
In Europe, the EU, the ESA, and European countries
are promoting their own unique space activities and
are cooperating with each other to implement space
activities.[12] The ESA signed a “framework agreement”
with the EU in May 2004 to prescribe that they will
coordinate on proceeding with space development and
hold regular minister-level council meetings. The joint
council meeting held by the ESA and the EU in May
2007 approved the “European Space Policy.”[13] This
“European Space Policy” mentions improving synergy
effects between space activities for civil and defense
purposes, and the importance of implementing space
activities based on coordinated efforts among member
states and ensuring an internationally competitive space
industry. The Policy identifi es security as one of its areas
of priority.
It is thought that in the future, “Galileo,” a satellite
positioning system planned by the EU and the ESA;[14]
“Copernicus,” an Earth observation program;[15] and the
Multinational Space-based Imaging System (MUSIS),[16]
a reconnaissance satellite project implemented by the
European Defence Agency (EDA),[17] will be utilized for
security in Europe.

4 China


China began working on space development in the 1950s,
and in April 1970, the county launched its fi rst satellite
“Dong Fang Hong I,” mounted on the transportation
launch vehicle “Long March 1,”[18] using technology
enhanced through its missile development.


3 Europe


Regarding European outer space activities, France
succeeded in launching its own satellite for the fi rst
time in 1965, following the former Soviet Union and
the United States, and the United Kingdom succeeded
in launching its own satellite for the fi rst time in 1971.
Italy and Germany used launch vehicles developed by
the United States to own satellites in December 1964
and July 1965, respectively. Meanwhile, the European
Space Agency (ESA)[11] Convention signed in May 1975


8 According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, the Aerospace Forces were created by merging the Air Force and the Aerospace Defence Forces, and started performing its tasks in August 2015. The
tasks of the Aerospace Forces include: (1) providing focused combat command to the air force; (2) conducting aerial and missile defense; (3) launching and controlling satellites; (4) warning about
missile attack; and (5) monitoring outer space.

9 In July 2014, the fi rst launch of “Angara-1.2PP” was conducted successfully. In December 2014, “Angara-A5” successfully put a dummy satellite into orbit for the fi rst time. The Angara launch vehicle
is considered as the fi rst large launch vehicle that Russia developed after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It is expected that the vehicle will be launching commercial as well as military satellites.

10 The new launch site is being built to replace the Russian-leased Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, and Russia aims to have the site fully operational by 2020.

11 The ESA was established in May 1975 based on the ESA Convention targeting to establish a single European space organization focusing on the peaceful use of space research, technology, and
application areas. The organization was formally established in October 1980.

12 In September 2000, the European Commission (EC) and the ESA created the European Strategy for Space that committed to pursuing Europe’s coherent and effective space activities. The strategy
envisioned that the EC would make political and strategic decisions on space policies and that ESA would function as the implementing organization. For the satellite positioning system “Galileo”
currently in operation and the environmental and security monitoring program “Copernicus,” the EU and ESA are complementing each other in carrying these projects forward, with the former mainly
taking charge of the policy dimension and the latter the technical dimension.

13 The EC released the European Strategy for Space in October 2016.

14 In December 2016, initial services were launched with 18 satellites. Galileo is set to offer the services in conjunction with GPS because of the insuffi cient number of satellites. The system is expected
to be fully operational by 2020 when all 30 satellites are in place.

15 New observation satellites called “Sentinels” are being launched to collect imagery necessary for conducting Earth observations. Sentinels are classifi ed according to their purpose into: 1) all-weather
satellite that takes images of land and ocean; 2) all-weather satellite capable of high-resolution land monitoring to provide imagery of vegetation, inland waterways, and coastal areas; and 3) satellite
measuring land-and sea-surface temperature and topography. Six Sentinels are said to be in orbit as of January 2018.

16 The European Defence Agency (EDA) was established in 2004 to improve Europe’s defense capabilities for crisis management purposes and to execute and maintain security and defense policies.

17 The MUSIS was started by Belgium, Germany, Greece, France, Italy, and Spain. The organization was joined later by Poland in December 2010. This is a joint project succeeding such projects as
“Helios 2” (a French military reconnaissance satellite), “Pleiades” (a French Earth imaging satellite used for military and civilian purposes), “SAR-Lupe” (a German group of military radar satellites),
“COSMO-SkyMed” (an Italian constellation of Earth observation satellites), and “Ingenio” (a Spanish optical satellite).

18 The number of cargo rocket launches in 2016 was 22 in the United States, 22 in China, 17 in Russia, 11 in Europe, 7 in India, 4 in Japan, and 1 in Israel. In terms of the number of rocket
launches, China overtook Russia for the fi rst time to equal the U.S. Moreover, the number of rocket launches in 2017 were 29 in the U.S., 19 in Russia, 18 in China, 11 in Europe (France), 7 in

China has thus far conducted activities such as
manned space fl ight and lunar rover launches. It is
speculated that China’s space development is intended to
enhance national prestige and develop space resources.
With regard to the organizational setup, the State
Administration for Science, Technology and Industry
for National Defense, under the Ministry of Industry
and Information Technology of the State Council,
oversees industries related to space, nuclear technology,
aviation, ships, and weapons. The China National Space
Administration enforces the administrative control of
the space area for civil and commercial purposes and
represents the Chinese Government externally.
China’s defense white paper “China’s Military
Strategy” (May 2015) states that outer space is a
commanding height in strategic competition among all
nations. Meanwhile, China asserts that its activities in
outer space constitute “peaceful use of outer space,” and
underscores that China is “opposed [to] the weaponization
of and arms race in outer space, and [will take] an active
part in international space cooperation.” China also
commits to “[keeping] abreast of the dynamics of outer
space, deal with security threats and challenges in that
domain, and secure its space assets.” In addition, “China’s
Space Activities in 2016,” China’s white paper on space
activities released in December 2016, presents a vision to
“build China into a space power” and for “the realization
of the Chinese Dream.” It also presents a schedule of
launches[19] up to 2020, and emphasizes international
cooperation and the peaceful use of space. On the other
hand, the white paper also notes that China will satisfy
its needs for security, which does not deny the country’s
military use of space.
China is indeed actively using space for information
collection, communications,[20] and positioning for
military purposes.[21] While the details of the tasks and
organization of the Strategic Support Force, established
in January 2016, have not been revealed, it is pointed out


as being in charge of outer space, cyber, and electronic
warfare. Also, in addition to the continuation of the
launch of Long March series cargo rockets,[22] China has
announced the plan for developing a cargo rocket capable
of carrying extra heavy payloads. Carrier launch vehicles
are developed and manufactured by Chinese state-owned
enterprises, which are thought to be also developing
and manufacturing ballistic missiles. It is expected that
China will pursue space development through close
collaboration between the public sector, military, and
private sector. Moreover, it is regarded that China is
focusing also on the development of satellite ground
stations and opened China’s fi rst satellite data receiving
station outside of China, near Kiruna in Sweden in
December 2016.[23] Furthermore, the country has launched
a manned space program with the aim of constructing its
own space station.[24] The fi rst unmanned cargo spacecraft,
Tianzhou 1, was launched in April 2017 from Wenchang
Space Launch Center on the carrier rocket, Long March-7
Y2. After that, Tianzhou 1 succeeded in being docked
with Tiangong-2, a space laboratory. Other than that, the
Hainan Sheng Institute of Remote Sensing is planning to
launch a series of 10 satellites between 2019 and 2021.
Also, China is considered to have become one of the space
powers through investments, research and development,


19 In addition to lunar exploration, it also cites the launch of worldwide services for the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, Mars exploration, asteroid exploration, and Jupiter exploration.

20 In August 2016, China launched the world’s fi rst quantum science satellite called Mozi that will be carrying out a proof-of-concept mission for quantum communication between space and a
ground station

21 By December 2012, the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System offi cially started its services covering most of the Asia-Pacifi c region. It is reported that the BeiDou system has already started to be
mounted on navy vessels, government vessels belonging to maritime law enforcement agencies, fi shing boats, among other vessels. BeiDou offers not only positioning services but also interactive
short message features. It is suggested that these features make it possible to centrally capture and share, in real time, the position and other data related to vessels of other countries that Chinese
navy vessels have detected, and improve information gathering capabilities on the ocean and other areas.

22 In September 2015, China succeeded in its fi rst launch of Long March-6 (for launching small satellites) and Long March-11 (solid-fuel propellant, for instantaneous launching of small satellites). China
also succeeded in launching Long March-7 (for launching “Shenzhou” manned spacecraft) in June 2016 and Long March-5 (for launching large satellites) in November 2016. On the other hand, the
launch of their Long March 5 rocket in July 2017 ended in failure. It also announced plans to launch Long March-9 (for launching ultra-large satellites), which aims to achieve capability to launch
100-ton payload into low orbit, by around 2030.

23 It is noted that this receiving station located in the Arctic Circle offers many security advantages, such as ease of receiving data obtained by Earth observation satellites in sun-synchronous orbits
(including photo reconnaissance satellites).

24 The National Medium and Long-Term Program for Science and Technology Development published by the State Council of China in February 2006 positions space station construction, lunar

and introduction of technologies from the United States
and other countries. It has been suggested that China
could threaten U.S. information superiority in outer space
in the future.[25] Furthermore, as described earlier, China
continues to develop ASATs. In January 2007, China
conducted a test using a ground-launched missile that
destroyed its own satellite. In July 2014, China tested
an anti-satellite missile not involving the destruction of
a satellite.[26] It is also suggested that China is developing
directed-energy weapons,[27] including “killer satellites,”
jammers, and laser beams.


an Earth observation satellite, which are supposedly
used also for security purposes. In February 2017, India
successfully launched a satellite launch vehicle loaded
with 104 satellites,[30] marking the largest number ever
carried on a single rocket in the world. In the future, the
country plans to implement planetary explorations and
conduct manned space fl ight.[31]

6 Republic of Korea


The Republic of Korea (ROK) is considered to have
started full-scale space development from the latter
half of the 1990s. The ROK carries out space activities
based on the three key plans it established in November
2013, namely: the “Mid- and Long-Term Plan for Space
Development (2014-2040),”[32] which plans to move up the
fi rst launch of launch vehicles manufactured by the ROK[33]
to June 2020;[34] the “Space Technology Industrialization
Strategy,” which prompts the private sector to lead space
development; and the “Revision of the Korean Rocket
Development Plan,” which outlines the use of ROKmade launch vehicles and the ROK’s own development
of planetary and space exploration satellites and high
orbit satellites.
On the organizational front, the Korea Aerospace
Research Institute leads research and development as an
implementation agency. Furthermore, the Korea Agency
for Defense Development is engaged in the development
and use of various satellites.
Major satellites used by the country include imagery
reconnaissance and communication satellites. The ROK
relies on other countries to launch its satellites.


5 India


India’s space development promotes space programs
aimed at social and economic development in line with
the fi ve-year national plan. The country’s 12th FiveYear Plan[28] focuses on non-military projects including
communication, positioning, Earth observation (e.g.,
disaster monitoring, resource exploration, and weather
observation), transportation systems, space science, and
spinoff promotions.
The Space Commission (SC) determines the country’s
space policy under the leadership of the Prime Minister
and assumes responsibility for securing space development
budgets and implementing space development programs.
The Space Agency, managed by the SC, oversees the Indian
Space Research Organisation (ISRO), which implements
space development policy following the country’s space
policy, develops and launches launch vehicles, and
develops and manufactures satellites.
In April 2016, India operated a positioning satellite
that can position itself around India[29] as well as launched


25 According to the annual report of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission of November 2015.

26 The February 2015 “Worldwide Threat Assessment” of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence notes that in July 2014, China tested an anti-satellite missile not involving the destruction of a satellite.
In addition, it states that China has satellite jamming capabilities and is making progress on an anti-satellite system.

27 According to the “Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China” published by the U.S. DoD in June 2017, China continues to develop
directed-energy weapons, electronic countermeasure systems (jammers), and a variety of capabilities including capability to counter satellite, designed to limit or block the use of space assets by
adversaries during a crisis or confl ict.

28 The 12th Five-Year Plan covers the period between April 2012 and March 2017. The 13th Five-Year Plan has yet to be announced.

29 In April 2016, India succeeded in launching the seventh satellite constituting the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS), which completed the deployment of the constellation.

30 All 104 satellites were launched and placed into polar orbit at the same time. They comprised India’s roughly 700 kg Cartosat-2D Earth observation satellite and 103 small satellites weighing less
than about 10 kg each (1 each from Israel, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the UAE, 2 from India, and 96 from the United States).

31 In December 2014, the ISRO succeeded in the test launch of a large launch vehicle carrying an unmanned capsule.

32 In January 2013, for the fi rst time on its third attempt, the ROK successfully launched the space launch vehicle “Naro (KSLV-1)” that was developed based on the fi rst stage of the Russian Angara rocket.

33 The ROK had planned to launch a test space rocket in December 2017, but has postponed this launch until October 2018 due to technical issues.

**Section 5 Trends in Cyberspace**


1 Cyberspace and Security


Owing to the advancement of information and
communications technology (ICT) in recent years,
information and communications networks such as the
Internet have become essential components across all
facets of life. Meanwhile, cyber attacks[1] against critical
infrastructures, namely, information and communications
networks, have the potential to seriously impact the lives
of individuals.
Types of cyber attacks include functional disruption,
data falsifi cation and data theft caused by unauthorized
access to information and communications networks or
through the transmission of viruses via e-mail, functional
impairment of the networks through simultaneous
transmission of large quantities of data, as well as attacks
intending to shut down or take over a system belonging
to critical infrastructure, such as power systems. Also,
Internet-related technologies are constantly evolving,
with cyber attacks[2] becoming more and more advanced
and sophisticated by the day.
For military forces, information and communication
capability form the foundation of command and control,
which extend from central command to ground-level
forces. In this regard, ICT advancements are further
enhancing the dependence of units on information

2 Threats in Cyberspace


and communications networks. Furthermore, military
forces rely on various critical infrastructures, including
electricity, to execute their missions. Accordingly, cyber
attacks against such critical infrastructures could become
a major impediment to their missions. For this reason,
cyber attacks are regarded as an asymmetrical strategy
capable of mitigating the strengths of adversaries by
exploiting the weaknesses of an adversary’s forces. It is
believed that many foreign military forces are developing
offensive capabilities in cyberspace. It has been pointed
out that China and Russia in particular are bolstering
the cyber attacking capabilities of their militaries for
the purpose of obstructing the networking of military
forces and destroying infrastructure.[3] In addition, actors
(including non-state actors) attempting to cause harm
to nations, etc. are likely to have realized that attacking
through cyberspace is often easier than attacking directly
using physical means.[4] Moreover, it is said that the
information and communications networks of countries
are being compromised for the purpose of gathering
intelligence. As more confi dential information becoming
to be stored in cyberspace, cyber espionage through cyber
attacks is causing more serious damage.

forces of various countries.[5]

Some of these cyber attacks are said to involve
a range of organizations including China’s PLA,[6]


Under such circumstances, cyber attacks have frequently
been carried out against information and communications
networks of government organizations and military


The targets of cyber attacks are wide-ranging. Beginning with large targets, they range from global-level targets, including interstate targets, as well as nations and government institutions, local
communities, business communities and infrastructures, companies, and individuals. As such, it is said that measures to counter cyber attacks need to be optimal relative to the size of the target.

In the Japanese MOD’s “Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace” of September 2012, cyber attacks are characterized as follows: (1) diversity: cyber attacks involve diverse actors, methods,
objectives, and context; (2) anonymity: actors can easily conceal and disguise their identity; (3) stealth: some cyber attacks are diffi cult to identify and can take place without causing any realization
of damage; (4) offensive dominance: attack tools are easy to acquire depending on the tool, and it is diffi cult to completely eliminate software vulnerabilities; and (5) the diffi culties of deterrence:
retaliatory strikes and defensive measures have minimal deterrence effect.

According to the Worldwide Threat Assessment of the Director of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (March 2018).

According to the “Cybersecurity National Action Plan” unveiled by then U.S. President Obama in February 2016.

According to the annual report presented to Congress by the U.S. Offi ce of Management and Budget based on the Federal Information Security Management Act, the number of cybersecurity incidents
reported to federal offi ces in FY2017 in the U.S. was 35,277. Moreover, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence’s “Worldwide Threat Assessment” of February 2018 names Russia, China, Iran, and
North Korea as being the main countries that pose the greatest cyber threat to the U.S. It also indicates that (1) Russia is continuing its spying on critical infrastructure of the U.S. as well as that of
its allies, while also targeting the U.S., NATO and allies in trying to obtain information on U.S. policies, (2) China is continuing its engagement in cyber espionage while also enhancing its cyber attack
capabilities to address its priority issues in national security, (3) Iran is continuing infi ltration efforts in countries allied to the U.S and the West for the purpose of espionage and in preparing for future
cyber attacks, and (4) North Korea is engaging in cyber activities to acquire funds, gather information and launch attacks against the ROK and the U.S. See Part 1, Chapter 3, Section 1 regarding ISIL’s
use of cyberspace.

“APT 1: Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units,” released in February 2013 by Mandiant, a U.S. information security company, concludes that the most active cyber attack group targeting the
United States and other countries is Unit 61398 under then Third Department of the PLA General Staff Department. The report also states that then Third Department of the General Staff Department,

intelligence agencies, security agencies, private hacker
groups, and companies.[7] According to the defense white
paper “China’s Military Strategy” (May 2015),[8] China
will expedite the development of a cyber force and
enhance its cyber capabilities. Furthermore, it has been
pointed out that cyber warfare units have been formed
under the Strategic Support Force that was created as
part of China’s military reforms[9] in late December 2015.
In June 2015, the U.S. Offi ce of Personnel Management
(OPM) became a target of a cyber attack in which, as
it later came to light, personal information of about
22 million people including U.S. federal employees
and U.S. Forces personnel were stolen. While Chinese
involvement in this attack has been suggested,[10] China
denies its involvement and explains that it was a “crime”
involving Chinese hackers.
Moreover, it was pointed out that in April 2017, two
groups of hackers associated with Chinese governmental
organizations carried out cyber attacks on the government,
military and defense companies of the ROK.[11] It has been
pointed out that China is using cyber attacks to obtain
sensitive information concerning critical infrastructure,
national security decision-making processes, and plans
of military tactics of other countries.[12]

Russia’s involvement has been pointed out in the
cyber attack that caused a large-scale power outage in
Ukraine in December 2015.[13] As for the cyber attack
caused by ransomware in many countries centered on
Ukraine in June 2017, both the U.S. and U.K. governments
announced in February 2018 that it was initiated by the
Russian military.
Government has also criticized Russian intelligence


agencies for carrying out cyber attacks to affect the
outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[14] In
March 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice announced
that it indicted four hackers, including two offi cers of the
Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), for computer
hacking in order to steal information from at least 500
million user accounts of a major U.S. Internet company.
It is believed that the Russian military, intelligence and
security agencies, and other organizations engage in
cyber attacks. Furthermore, it is clear that the Russian
military has its own cyber command.[15] This cyber
command is believed to be responsible for conducting
offensive cyber activities,[16] including inserting malware
into command and control systems of adversaries.[17] It
has been indicated that such Russian activities refl ect
objectives including intelligence gathering to support
Russian decision-making, operations to support military
and political objectives, and continuing preparation of the
cyberspace environment for future contingencies.[18]
It was reported in May 2017 that the ROK Ministry
of National Defense had concluded that the September
2016 cyber attack on the internal network of the ROK
Armed Forces was conducted by an entity which was
believed to be a North Korean hacker group.[19] Moreover,
it has been pointed out that documents containing military
secrets were stolen as the result of this cyber attack. In
the Wannacry Malware cyber attack in May 2017, the
malware encrypted and rendered unusable hundreds of
thousands of computers in hospitals, schools, businesses
in over 150 countries. Regarding this incident, the United
States announced that it has publicly attributed the cyber
attack to North Korea in December of that same year.[20]


7 The Annual Report of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (November 2016) notes that China carries out cyber espionage led by the Ministry of State Security and military
organizations as well as cyber espionage led by China’s many non-state actors targeting the United States. These actors include hackers contracted by the government, civilian “patriotic hackers,”
and criminal organizations.

8 The defense white paper notes that, “Cyberspace has become a new pillar of economic and social development, and a new domain of national security,” “As international strategic competition in
cyberspace has been turning increasingly fi ercer, quite a few countries are developing their cyber military forces,” and China is “one of the major victims of hacker attacks.”

9 Since September 2015, China has publicized a series of its decisions on military reforms, and in January 2016, announced the establishment of the Strategic Support Force and other units. While
the details of the Force’s tasks and organization have not been revealed, it is suggested that it is in charge of outer space, cyber, and electronic warfare.

10 See the Annual Report of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (November 2015). In addition to this attack, the report states that a U.S. airline company was attacked by the
same method used in the attack against the U.S. Offi ce of Personnel Management (OPM).

11 According to the report of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission of July 2017.

12 According to the Annual Report of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission released in November 2017.

13 In February 2016, the New York Times reported that there were doubts about the involvement of the Russian military with which Ukraine is in a standoff over the annexation of Crimea and other matters.

14 According to the joint statement issued in October 2016 by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the director of National Intelligence of the United States, and the joint report issued in
December of the same year by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the FBI concerning Russian cyber attacks on the U.S., as well as the U.S. intelligence community report on Russia’s cyber
attacks on the U.S. presidential election released in January 2017. Moreover, during the 2017 presidential campaign in France, Macron, known as a hardliner on Russia, was reportedly a target of a
cyber attack, as well as a widespread fake news story about having hidden assets in a tax haven. After being appointed president, in a joint press conference of the French and Russian presidents,
Macron criticized Russian media outlets by name, referring to them as organs of lying propaganda.

15 The incident occurred in 2014. Other than that, there was another cyber attack on this Internet company in 2013, resulting in leaking of information on 3 billion people.

16 According to a statement made by Russian Minister of Defence Shoigu during a briefi ng for lower house members in February 2017. According to this statement, the Russian military has a cyber
command. Minister Shoigu emphasized that the command was “for opposing political propaganda activities” since there was an information war taking place between Russia and the West, indicating
the purpose of the command was for defense. Also, it is pointed out that the number of Russia's cyber troops comes to approximately 1,000.

17 According to then U.S. Director of National Intelligence Clapper’s written testimony on “Worldwide Cyber Threats” at the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in September 2015.

18 According to the U.S. Director of National Intelligence’s “Worldwide Threat Assessment” (May 2017).

19 According to the digital ROK National Defense Report in May 2017. Furthermore, the report revealed that IP addresses (Internet addresses) used in the attacks were traced back to the Shenyang
region of China, known to have been used by existing North Korean hackers.

It has been pointed out that this cyber attack succeeded
in collecting 140,000 dollars in Bitcoins. In addition,
according to the ROK National Intelligence Service,
North Korea has repeatedly hacked the ROK exchanges
for the purpose of stealing cryptocurrency, and it has
succeeded in acquiring the equivalent of several dozen
billion won (several billion yen). These cyber attacks
were believed to be for raising money.
It has been pointed out that North Korean government
institutions are involved in such cyber attacks,[21] and as a
national project, the North Korea is training hackers for
cyber attacks.[22]
Meanwhile, in Japan, the Japan Pension Service was
hacked in May 2015, which led to the theft of the personal
information of pension recipients and policyholders.
Other than this incident, there are many reports about
cyber attacks on governmental agencies and businesses in

3 Initiatives against Cyber Attacks


defense and aerospace industries, allegedly conducted by
state-sponsored hacker groups. In addition, supply chain
risks, including products embedded with deliberately
and fraudulently altered programs, and the existence
of advanced malware designed to attack industrial
control systems are cause for concern.[23] Cyber attacks
exploiting insecure IoT devices, including the massive
cyber attack by the Mirai malware in 2016, are becoming
conspicuous, and this kind of threat is expected to grow
in the future.[24] Cyber attacks on telecommunication
networks of a government and military forces, or on
critical infrastructure[25] could have a serious effect on the
security of states, and it has been pointed out that statesponsored cyber attacks have been on the rise in recent
years. Given this situation, there is a need for continuous
monitoring of trends in the threats in cyberspace.

and Japan calling for maintaining a free cyberspace,[27]
while Russia, China, and most emerging countries call
for strengthening national control of cyberspace. Against
this backdrop, there has been a movement to promote the
rule of law in cyberspace in the international community.
The Fifth UN Group of Governmental Experts failed to
submit a conclusive report, however, discussions are being
held on the establishment of international rules within the
framework of global conferences on cyberspace.[28]

[See] Part III, Chapter 1, Section 2-7 (Response to Cyber Attacks)


Given these growing threats in cyberspace, various
initiatives are under way at the whole of government level
and the ministry level, including defense ministries.[26]
A number of issues have been raised that need to be
dealt with to enable an effective response to be taken to
cyber attacks, which have become a new security challenge
in recent years. For instance, it is regarded that the
international community has diverging views concerning
the fundamental matters of cyberspace, including how
international law applies. It is suggested that countries
have clashing claims, with the United States, Europe,


21 In November 2013, ROK media outlets reported that the ROK National Intelligence Service made revelations about North Korean cyber warfare capabilities in the national audit of the Information
Committee of the National Assembly, and that Kim Jong-un, First Secretary of the Korean Workers’ Party of North Korea, stated that, “Cyber attacks are omnipotent swords with their power paralleled
with nuclear power and missiles.” In the U.S. Department of Defense’s “Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,”
introduced in Congress in February 2016, it is stated that North Korea has an offensive cyber operations capability. The 2016 Defense White Paper published by the ROK in January 2017 notes that
North Korea has concentrated on boosting its cyber units to nearly 7,000 personnel.

22 For example, “NK Intellectual Solidarity,” a North Korean defector association in the ROK, held a seminar entitled “Emergency seminar on cyber terrorism by North Korea 2011” in June 2011, and
presented material entitled “North Korea’s cyber terrorism capabilities,” explaining that North Korean organizations conducting cyber attacks were supported by government agencies employing
superior human resources from all over the country, giving them special training to develop their cyber attack capabilities.

23 In October 2012, the U.S. House Information Special Committee published an investigation report, entitled “Investigative Report on the U.S. National Security Issues Posed by Chinese Telecommunications
Companies Huawei and ZTE.” The report advised that products manufactured by Huawei Technologies and Zhong Xing Telecommunication Equipment (ZTE) (major Chinese communications equipment
manufacturers) should not be used, due to their threats to national security based on strong concerns over China’s cyber attack capabilities and intentions targeting critical U.S. infrastructure, as well
as opaque relations between Chinese major IT companies and the central government, the Chinese Communist Party, and the PLA augmenting supply chain risks. A similar move has been taken by
other countries, including France, Australia, Canada, India, and Taiwan. Some countries, including the United Kingdom and the ROK, have issued warnings.

24 According to the “Cybersecurity Strategic Mid-Term Review: What Is Expected of Cybersecurity in 2020 and Beyond” prepared by the Cybersecurity Strategic Headquarters in July 2017.

25 In “North Korean Actors Spear Phish U.S. Electric Companies” published in October 2017 by FireEye, the U.S. cybersecurity company, multiple U.S. electric companies are said to have been attacked
through spear phishing emails from cyber threat actors likely affi liated with the North Korean government, in September 2017.

26 Generally, the trends at the governmental level are thought to include the following: (1) organizations related to cybersecurity that are spread over multiple departments and agencies are being
integrated, and their operational units are being centralized; (2) policy and research units are being enhanced by establishing specialized posts, creating new research divisions and enhancing such
functions; (3) the roles of intelligence agencies in responding to cyber attacks are being expanded; and (4) more emphasis is being given to international cooperation. At the level of the defense
ministry, various measures have been taken, such as establishing a new agency to supervise cyberspace military operations and positioning the effort to deal with cyber attacks as an important
strategic objective.

27 These countries have called for the free fl ow of information and multi-stake holder approach including business and civil society as well as governments.

28 Global conferences on cyberspace have been held since being proposed by the then U.K. Foreign Secretary Hague in 2011, and the series of conferences has been called the “London Process.”
The conferences have been attended by the governments, international organizations, groups from the private sector, NGOs, etc., of over 100 countries, and comprehensive discussions are held on

military operations. Additionally, the DoD states that
the aforementioned cyber capabilities include cyber
operations to disrupt an adversary’s military-related
systems.
U.S. Cyber Command's mission is to “direct,
synchronize, and coordinate cyberspace planning
and operations.” The Command consists of the Cyber
Protection Teams that manages the cyber forces of the
U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, and
operates and defends the information infrastructure of
the DoD, the National Mission Teams that support U.S.
defense against national-level threats, and the Combat
Mission Teams that supports the operations conducted by
unifi ed combatant commands on the cyber front (these
three Teams are collectively referred to as the Cyber
Mission Force).[32] U.S. Cyber Command,which had been
a subunifi ed command under U.S. Strategic Command,
was elevated to a unifi ed combatant command in May
2018, allowing the Cybercom commander to report
directly to the U.S. Secretary of Defense as is the case
with other unifi ed combatant command commanders.[33]

The United States deems that China continues to
conduct cyber-enabled theft targeting a broad set of U.S.
interests ranging from information related to national
security, to sensitive economic information and U.S.
intellectual property.
In September 2015, then U.S. President Obama and
Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed at their summit
meeting that the two countries will not conduct cyberespionage of intellectual property.[34] Then in November
2017, President Trump and President Xi Jinping agreed
to continue upholding the terms of the agreement at
the summit meeting in 2015. Nevertheless, it has been
pointed out[35] that cyber espionage by China continues
unimpeded as before.


1 The United States


In the United States, the Department of Homeland
Security is responsible for protecting Federal government
networks and critical infrastructure against cyber attacks,
and the Department’s Offi ce of Cybersecurity and
Communications (CS&C) works to protect the networks
of government agencies.[29]
According to the National Security Strategy
announced by the United States in December 2017,
many countries regard cyber capabilities as being a
measure to infl uence other countries, and cyber attacks
have become a crucial aspect of modern-day warfare. As
such, the United States intends to deter, defend, and if
necessary, defeat other countries with cyber capabilities.
To ensure this, the United States came up with a strategic
policy to streamline integration of the U.S. government’s
authorities and procedures to (1) improve its capabilities
in identifying cyber attacks and responding quickly to
them, (2) improve cyber measures for protecting the
assets, critical infrastructure, information, etc., of the
U.S. government, and boosting expertise, and (3) enable
the launching of cyber operations against adversaries
when necessary. In January 2018, the U.S. Department
of Defense (DoD) announced the 2018 National Defense
Strategy, which props up the National Security Strategy.
It described a policy of investments in cyber defense,
resilience, and the continued integration of cyber
capabilities into the full spectrum of military operations.
Moreover, the DoD Cyber Strategy[30] released in April
2015 under the Obama administration states that the
DoD has set out the following three primary missions[31]
in cyberspace: (1) defend DoD networks, systems, and
information; (2) defend the United States and its interests
against cyber attacks of signifi cant consequence; and
(3) provide integrated cyber capabilities to support


29 The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a cybersecurity strategy in May 2018. More than 20 billion devices are expected to become connected to the Internet by 2020, and this is also
said to increase the risks.

30 The DoD Cyber Strategy states that Russia and China have acquired advanced cyber capabilities and strategies. It goes on to say that Russian activities are carried out stealthily and their intentions are
diffi cult to discern. The Strategy notes that China steals intellectual property to benefi t Chinese companies. Furthermore, it states that while Iran and North Korea have less developed cyber capabilities,
they have displayed an overt level of hostile intent towards the United States and U.S. interests.

31 In order to execute these missions in cyberspace, the DoD presents the following fi ve strategic goals: (1) Build and maintain ready forces and capabilities to conduct cyberspace operations; (2) Defend
the DoD information network, secure DoD data, and mitigate risks to DoD missions; (3) Establish arrangements to defend the United States and its interests from cyber attacks of signifi cant
consequence through collaboration with relevant departments and companies; (4) Use cyber options to control confl ict; and (5) Build close cooperative relations with allies and partners.

32 According to a statement made in April 2015 by the commander of U.S. Cyber Command to the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services, and other sources, the three forces are made up of several
teams, and dozens of them are currently operating. Employing the National Guard and reserve units, the Cyber Mission Force is set to have 133 teams (National Mission Teams [13 teams], Cyber
Protection Teams [68 teams], Combat Mission Teams [27 teams], Support Teams [25 teams]) and 6,200 personnel by September 2018.

33 In announcing the elevation of U.S. Cyber Command to a combatant command, the U.S. DoD has stated that the domain of cyberspace is just as important for military operations as land, sea and air,
and that operational capabilities in cyberspace are indispensable for military success. They indicated that the future issues will be the bolstering of cyber weapons, cyber defense, and the scale and
capabilities of cyber personnel.

34 During the summit meeting, then President Obama allegedly expressed deep concerns over China’s cyber attacks and stated that the United States would exercise all possible tools, hinting at the
application of economic sanctions. Meanwhile, the two sides agreed that they would hold U.S.-China ministerial dialogues on fi ghting cybercrime. Moreover, Australia has agreed for both countries
not to engage in cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property at the high-level security dialog with China in April 2017.

2 NATO

The NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) Policy
on Cyber Defence, and its action plan, which were
adopted in June 2011: (1) clarify the political and
operational mechanisms of NATO’s response to cyber
attacks; (2) clarify that NATO would provide assistance
to member states to develop their cyber defense, and
provide assistance to member states if they are subject to
cyber attacks; and (3) set out principles on cooperation
with partners. Furthermore, at the NATO Summit in
September 2014, agreement was reached that NATO’s
collective defense applies to cyber attacks against
member states.
As for its organization, the North Atlantic Council
(NAC) provides political oversight on policies and
operations concerned with NATO’s cyber defense. In
addition, the Emerging Security Challenges Division
formulates policy and action plans concerning cyber
defense.Furthermore, in November 2017, an agreement
was reached on creation of a new Cyber Operations
Center to help integrate cyber into NATO planning and
operations.[36] Furthermore, NATO has conducted cyber
defense training exercises annually since 2008 to heighten
the defense capabilities of its servers. In addition, NATO
has expanded cooperation with EU in the fi elds of
cybersecurity and cyber defense.[37]
In 2008, the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence
Centre of Excellence (CCD COE) was authorized to
serve as NATO’s cyber defense-related research and
training institution,[38] and was established in Estonia’s
capital of Tallinn. CCD COE carries out research on the
relationship between cyber activities and international
law, and created the “Tallinn Manual.”[39] In February
2017, “Tallinn Manual 2.0” was published as the second
edition of the previous manual based on a review of broad
discussion points, from peacetime legal regimes, such
as laws on state responsibility, human rights, aviation,
space, and maritime affairs, to contingency legal regimes,
such as the use of force and laws on armed confl ict.


3 The United Kingdom


The United Kingdom, in its “NSS- SDSR2015” released
in November 2015, committed to investing £1.9 billion
over the next fi ve years in increasing its cyber defense
capabilities to strengthen the functions for identifying
and analyzing cyberspace threats. In November 2016,
the country announced a new “Cyber Security Strategy”
that presented a vision for the United Kingdom, which
is to be secure and resilient to cyber threats, prosperous
and con dent in the digital world. To achieve this vision,
the Strategy requires the United Kingdom to possess
the means to effectively “defend” from cyber threats,
to “deter” through having the means for offensive cyber
action, and to “develop” cutting-edge technologies.
In terms of the Government’s overall cybersecurity
policy, the Offi ce of Cyber Security and Information
Assurance (OCSIA) has been set up to present strategic
policies and to coordinate cybersecurity planning for the
overall government. In October 2016, the National Cyber
Security Centre (NCSC) was newly established under the
Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ)
to promote public-private partnerships for responses to
national cyber incidents.

4 Australia


In its fi rst “National Security Strategy” published In
January 2013, Australia positions integrated cyber
policies and operations as one of the top national
security priorities. In April 2016, a new “Cyber Security
Strategy” through 2020 was released, which provides
that Australia will ensure the safety of the people, that
private companies will participate in cybersecurity, and
that threat information will be shared.
In terms of organization, the Australian Cyber
Security Centre (ACSC) that brings cybersecurity
capabilities from across the government into a single
location was established in November 2014 to respond
to major cybersecurity issues related to government


36 According to the press conference after the NATO Defense Ministers’ Meeting in November 2017.

37 In July 2016, NATO and the EU signed a Joint Declaration with the aim of expanding cooperation in dealing with new issues, such as those in terrorism, refugees and immigrants, including the
cybersecurity issues. They have been strengthening cooperation, for example, by exchanging information on cyber defense.

38 In June 2013, the NATO Defense Ministers’ Meeting placed cyber attacks at the top of the agenda for the fi rst time. They agreed to establish an emergency response team and to implement a cyber
defense mechanism on a full scale by October 2013.

39 The “Tallinn Manual” and the “Tallinn Manual 2.0” are both considered independent outputs of the members that participated in the project (Professor Michael N. Schmitt of the U.S. Naval War College

agencies and critical infrastructures.[40] In July 2015, the
ACSC issued its fi rst report on cybersecurity,[41] which
contended that the number, type, and sophistication of
cyber threats to Australia are all increasing. Moreover
cyber forces were established within the military in July
2017 to strengthen the Department of Defence’s cyber
capabilities and systems.[42]

5 Republic of Korea


The ROK formulated the “National Cyber Security Master
Plan” in August 2011, which clarifi es the supervisory
functions of the National Intelligence Service[43] in
responding to cyber attacks. It places particular emphasis


on strengthening the following fi ve areas: prevention,
detection, response,[44] systems, and security base. In the
national defense sector, the Cyber Measures Technology
Team was established by the Ministry of National Defense
to respond to cyber and hacking threats.[45] It also created
the “National Cybersecurity Crisis Response Manual”
that stipulates rapid response procedures to cybersecurity
crises after drawing up the “National Cyber Security
Strategy.” In 2015, the Joint Chiefs of Staff centralized
the cyber attack tactical system mainly around the Joint
Chiefs of Staff by newly establishing the Cyber Tactics
Department, assigning control authority concerning
cyber tactics to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
and publishing a fi eld manual on “joint cyber tactics.”


40 The ACSC, comprised of staff from the Australian Crime Commission, the Australian Federal Computer Emergency Response Team, and the Defence Intelligence Organisation, analyzes cyber threats
and responds incidents in both private and public sector.

41 According to the report, malicious actors in cyberspace targeting Australia are: (1) foreign government-sponsored adversaries; (2) serious and organized criminals; and (3) groups motivated by certain
issues and individuals with personal grievances.

42 According to Australia’s International Cyber Engagement Strategy announced in October 2017, the country’s offensive cyber capability in support of military operations will be deployed through the

**Section 6** **[Trends Concerning Military Science and Technology ]**
**as well as Defense Production and Technological Bases**


1 Military Science and Technological Trends

Recent developments in science and technology,
as represented by the dramatic advancement of
Information and Communications Technology (ICT),
has impacted a variety of areas, triggering significant
and revolutionary changes in many areas such as
economy, society, and lifestyle.
The military sphere is no exception. Developed
countries, including the United States, consider that
transformations driven by advances in ICT can dramatically
improve combat and other capabilities, and therefore,
continue to pursue a variety of ICT research and policies.
For example, if information on enemy forces collected
by using information-gathering systems, including
reconnaissance satellites and unmanned aircraft, is
shared on a network, command and control can be
exercised immediately, even from remote headquarters,
and offensive power can be directed swiftly, precisely,
and fl exibly against targets.
Additionally, new ICT technology has been developed
in recent years. For instance, in August 2016, China
launched a satellite called “Mozi” to perform the world’s
fi rst quantum cryptographic communications[1] testing.
Then in January 2017, it was said that they succeeded
in using Mozi for long-distance quantum cryptographic
communication between China and Australia. Going
forward, new technologies such as quantum cryptography
communications could potentially be applied to the
military fi eld in various countries in the future.


Furthermore, there is the possibility that a revolution
in military logistics will occur due to the 3D printing
technology, for example by allowing the procurement
of parts that does not rely on inventory. For instance, in
August 2017, the U.S. Navy announced that they carried
out a demonstration experiment on mobile 3D printer
equipment capable of manufacturing replacement parts[2]
in forward-deployed regions.
Major countries with sophisticated and modernized
military forces, place emphasis on improving the
destructive capabilities of weapons, precision guidance
technology, information- related technology including
C4ISR, unmanned technology (e.g., drones),[3] artifi cial
intelligence (AI) and big data analysis,[4] and hypersonic
technology[5] to be able to carry out more precise and
effective attacks. Recently, reports have been published
of successful tests of railguns[6] and high energy laser
weapons[7] that are expected to provide effective repower
compared to existing weapons, such as artillery, in terms
of their cost per ring, range, precision, promptness, and
other aspects. Furthermore, there have been reports about
the development of high speed strike weapons (HSSW)
that can strike even long-range targets with conventional
weapons, quickly and with pinpoint accuracy.[8]
Recent research of the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency (DARPA) of the U.S. Department of
Defense (DoD) has pointed out a variety of advanced
research and development in small unmanned aircraft


Quantum cryptographic communication is a method of communication that relies on quantum cryptographic technology, an encryption technology that makes use of quantum properties, and it is said
that third parties cannot decode it.

Associated equipment that includes 3D printers is stored in a container, allowing some parts to be manufactured immediately and on the spot.

Drones for military use such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), and unmanned maritime vehicle (UMV) have been developed (UMVs may be classifi ed into unmanned
surface vehicle (USV) and unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV)). It is suggested that these drones could shift from human-operated types to fully autonomous types, as known as Lethal Autonomous
Weapons Systems (LAWS). Furthermore, within the framework of the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW), discussions are taking place on the operation of systems
that automatically kill enemies without human judgment from the perspectives of their characteristics, human intervention and international law.

In the “Third Offset Strategy,” the United States has given the example of “deep-learning machine” technology using AI, which can analyze big data to detect signs of cyber attacks, issue alerts, etc.

For example, in the United States, DARPA and the Air Force are engaged in joint research and development of the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC), aiming to apply the
technology to hypersonic missiles, etc. in the future. HAWC uses the technology of scramjet engine, which enables hypersonic fl ight by taking in air at hypersonic speed and burning it without
reducing the speed to below the speed of sound. Furthermore, Russia is developing Zircon, an anti-ship hypersonic cruise missile, which has been attracting attention for its performance and
naval vessel it will be deployed on.

A railgun is a weapon that shoots bullets by using the magnetic fi eld generated from electric energy instead of gunpowder. The U.S. Forces are developing a railgun with a range of about 370 km, or
about ten times that of the existing 5-inch (127 mm) ammunition. A single railgun shot reportedly costs 1/20th to 1/60th the price of a missile.

The U.S. Forces are developing laser weapons to strengthen low-altitude air defense capabilities against small ships and drones, and fi ring tests have been carried out. It is considered that these high
energy laser weapons systems will be miniaturized, with a possibility for placing the weapons on light mobility vehicles. In addition, tests have been conducted on integrating the high energy liquid
laser area defense system (HELLADS) with the ground-based laser weapons system, since 2017. Tests have also been carried out to bring down unmanned aircraft by using lasers in efforts to put
the technology to practical use.

capable of airborne launch, recovery, and reuse,[9]
unmanned vessels to detect submarines,[10] long-range
anti-ship missiles available under electronic warfare
environment, spacecraft capable of rapidly launching
satellites,[11] and space monitoring telescopes capable of
discovering even small objects.
Recent advances in military science and technology
are also largely attributed to the advancement of civil
technology. In recent years, as the capabilities of existing
equipment are improved and new equipment is developed,
dual-use technology has been leveraged frequently.
In general, it is expected that countries which have


diffi culty possessing advanced technologies and nonstate actors including terrorist organizations will carry
out research and development on weapons and other
equipment that will enable them to gain superiority in
fi ghting against countries with state-of-the-art technology,
and illegitimately obtain technology through ICT or other
means.[12] For instance, ISIL seemed to have started using
unmanned aircraft for both reconnoitering and attacking,
therefore research and development of technology
for countering these threats[13] is also recognized as an
important challenge in the future.


2 Trends Concerning Defense Production and Technological Bases


Recently, Western countries in particular have continued
to face diffi culties when they try to increase defense
budgets signifi cantly. On the other hand, the sophistication
of military science and technology and the greater
complexity of equipment have escalated development
and production costs and have raised unit prices for
equipment procurement. Under these circumstances,
many countries are taking on a variety of initiatives in
order to maintain and enhance their national defense
production and technological bases.
Western countries have set a target to increase
competitiveness through realignment of their defense
industry, based on the aforementioned situation related
to national defense budgets. The United States has
experienced repeated mergers and integrations among
domestic corporations, while Europe has experienced
cross-border mergers and integrations of the defense
industry, especially in Germany, France, the United
Kingdom, and Italy.
In response to the escalation of development and
production costs, Western countries are promoting
joint development and production and technological
cooperation related to equipment among their allies and
partners. This move aims for (1) splitting development
and production costs, (2) expanding demands in


all countries participating in joint development and
production, (3) mutual complement of technologies, and
(4) raising domestic technology levels by obtaining the
latest technology.
For example, the joint development and production
of the F-35 fi ghter jet led by the United States is the largest
joint program. At present, there is anticipated demand for
around 3,200 aircraft.[14] This project will have impacts
on the defense production and technological bases of the
countries involved, through the operation, sustainment
and maintenance stages of the aircraft.
Additionally, there is an increasing number of
cases where governments are providing funding for
national defense-related research and development
conducted by the private sector. In the United States,
for example, approximately US$3.17 billion in research
and development funding was requested for FY 2018
to DARPA[15] whose mission is to make investments in
breakthrough technologies that will contribute to national
security. The defense authorities have long provided
substantial funding for the research conducted by
companies and universities. The EU has also promoted
a gradual process on the framework to fund research
related to defense technology, against the backdrop of the
consistent decline in national defense research expenditure


9 DARPA has announced plans to carry out fl ight tests in 2019 with the aim of testing the airborne launch and recovery of unmanned aircraft.

10 The Anti-Submarine Warfare Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV) (“Sea Hunter”) is capable of navigating several thousand kilometers for months without crewmembers on board through
constant remote supervision by humans. In August 2016, this vessel allegedly completed its initial sea trials ahead of its deployment by the U.S. Navy slated before the end of 2018.

11 In May 2017, DARPA announced the development of the spaceplane, “XS-1,” capable of launching satellites quickly and at low cost.

12 It has been reported in the media that the report released by the Combating Terrorism Center of the United States Military Academy has pointed out the possibility of improved performance in
unmanned aircraft used by terrorist organizations, including increased loading capacity and boosted fl ight range.

13 It has been reported that the DoD launched a 700 million dollar project as a measure against drone attacks by terrorist organizations such as ISIL.

14 There are nine countries involved in the joint development and production of the F-35 Fighter jets, which are Australia, Canada, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey, the United Kingdom,
and the United States. Countries acquiring them include Israel, the ROK, and Japan, and the defense production and technological base of these countries is involved in their production and
sustainment.

15 DARPA is the DoD agency. Approximately 100 program managers, who are hired for limited stints, generally three to fi ve years, oversee around 250 research and development programs. It does not

ROK have expanded exports of affordable equipment
due to the development of the infrastructure required
for production of equipment with the past imports of
equipment and the improvement of capabilities in science
and technology.
Importing countries adopt offset policies[17] in order
to keep a good balance between improving defense
capabilities through imports and developing domestic
defense production and technological bases, including
setting requirements that domestic companies would
be involved in parts manufacturing as a condition for
procurement of equipment and services from abroad.

by member states over the past 10 years. In 2017, the
EU commenced Preparatory Action on Common Security
and Defence Policy (CSDP) - related research in which it
will provide €90 million over three years to more than 12
national defense research programs, with the European
Defense Agency as the implementing body of this
framework.[16]
Countries have exported equipment overseas since the
Cold War era, and even today, many countries are taking
measures to promote exports.
Exports of equipment to the Asia-Pacifi c region have
increased in recent years. This has been underpinned by
economic growth in the region as well as the growing
infl uence of China, the existence of territorial disputes,
and responses to the enhancement of military buildup in
neighboring countries. Countries such as China and the


16 The EU has launched a funding program called “Horizon 2020” for research and innovation to which it has committed 80 billion Euros over the seven-year period from 2014 to 2020. However, the
provision of funds is limited to research for civilian or dual-use technology. In the United Kingdom, the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) has a budget of £6 million in FY2017 and
regularly solicits conceptual demonstration research topics in order to fund research with a novel, high risk and high potential earning rate to develop capabilities for U.K. defense and security.

**Section 2 Constitution and the Basis of Defense Policy**


1 Constitution and the Right of Self-Defense

Since the end of World War II, Japan made a decision not
to repeat the ravages of war and has worked hard to build
a peace-loving nation. The Japanese people desire lasting
peace, and the principle of pacifi sm is enshrined in the
Constitution, Article 9 of which prescribes the renunciation
of war, the prohibition of war potential, and the denial
of the right of belligerency of the state. Of course, since
Japan is an independent nation, these provisions do not


deny Japan’s inherent right of self-defense as a sovereign
state. Thus, the Japanese Government interprets this as a
constitutional right to possess the minimum armed forces
needed to exercise that right. Therefore, Japan, under the
Constitution, maintains the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) as
an armed organization, holding its exclusively defenseoriented policy as its basic strategy of defense, and
continues to keep it equipped and ready for operations.


2 The Government’s View on Article 9 of the Constitution


an imminent and illegitimate act of aggression against
Japan; (2) When there are no appropriate means to deal
with such aggression other than by resorting to the right
of self-defense; and (3) When the use of armed force is
confi ned to be the minimum necessary level. However,
it has been concluded in the Cabinet’s decision made
on July 1, 2014, “Development of Seamless Security
Legislation to Ensure Japan’s Survival and Protect its
People,”[1] that “the use of force” should be interpreted
to be permitted under the Constitution as measures for
self-defense when the following “three new conditions”
are met: (1) When an armed attack against Japan has
occurred, or when an armed attack against a foreign
country that is in a close relationship with Japan occurs
and as a result threatens Japan’s survival and poses a
clear danger to fundamentally overturn people’s right to
life, liberty and pursuit of happiness; (2) When there is
no appropriate means available to repel the attack and
ensure Japan’s survival and protect its people; (3) Use
of force to the minimum extent necessary. The following
is the interpretation of the measures for self-defense
permitted under Article 9 of the Constitution defi ned in
the abovementioned Cabinet decision.
The language of Article 9 of the Constitution appears
to prohibit “use of force” in international relations in
all forms. However, when considered in light of “the
right (of the people) to live in peace” as recognized in
the Preamble of the Constitution and the purpose of
Article 13 of the Constitution which stipulates, “their
(all the people’s) right to life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness” shall be the supreme consideration in


1 Permitted Self-Defense Capability


Under the Constitution, Japan is permitted to possess the
required minimum self-defense capability. The specifi c
limit is subject to change according to the prevailing
international situation, the level of military technologies,
and various other factors, and it is discussed and decided
through annual budget and other deliberations by the
Diet on behalf of the people. Whether such capability
constitutes a “war potential” that is prohibited by
Article 9, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution must be
considered within the context of Japan’s overall military
strength. Therefore, whether the SDF should be allowed
to possess certain armaments depends on whether
such possession would cause its total military strength
to exceed the constitutional limit. The possession of
armaments deemed to be offensive weapons designed
to be used only for the mass destruction of another
country is not permissible under any circumstance as
it would, by defi nition, exceed the minimum necessary
level. For example, the SDF is not allowed to possess
intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), long-range
strategic bombers, or attack aircraft carriers.


2 Measures for Self-Defense Permitted under
Article 9 of the Constitution


In the past, the Government had interpreted Article 9
of the Constitution to mean that armed force could be
used to exercise the right of self-defense only when the
following three conditions were met: (1) When there is


-----

governmental affairs, Article 9 of the Constitution cannot
possibly be interpreted to prohibit Japan from taking
measures of self-defense necessary to maintain its peace
and security and to ensure its survival. Such measures
for self-defense are permitted only when they are
inevitable for dealing with imminent unlawful situations
where the people’s right to life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness is fundamentally overturned due to an
armed attack by a foreign country, and for safeguarding
these rights of the people. Hence, “use of force” to the
minimum extent necessary to that end is permitted. This
is the basis, or the so-called basic logic, of the view
consistently expressed by the government to date with
regard to “use of force” exceptionally permitted under
Article 9 of the Constitution, and clearly shown in the
document “Relationship between the Right of Collective
Self-Defense and the Constitution” submitted by the
Government to the Committee on Audit of the House of
Councillors on October 14, 1972. This basic logic must
be maintained under Article 9 of the Constitution.
To date, the Government has considered that “use
of force” under this basic logic is permitted only when
an “armed attack” against Japan occurs. However, in
light of the situation in which the security environment
surrounding Japan has been fundamentally transformed
and continuously evolving by shifts in the global power
balance, the rapid progress of technological innovation,
and threats such as weapons of mass destruction, etc.,
in the future, even an armed attack occurring against a
foreign country could actually threaten Japan’s survival,
depending on its purpose, scale and manner, etc.
Japan, as a matter of course, will make the utmost
diplomatic efforts, should a dispute occur, for its peaceful
settlement and take all necessary responses in accordance
with the existing domestic laws and regulations developed
based upon the constitutional interpretation to date. It is
still required, however, to make all necessary preparations
in order to ensure Japan’s survival and protect its people.
Under such recognition and as a result of careful
examination in light of the current security environment,
it has been concluded that not only when an armed attack
against Japan occurs but also when an armed attack against
a foreign country that is in a close relationship with Japan
occurs and as a result threatens Japan’s survival and
poses a clear danger to fundamentally overturn people’s
right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, and when
there is no other appropriate means available to repel the
attack and ensure Japan’s survival and protect its people,
use of force to the minimum extent necessary should
be interpreted to be permitted under the Constitution as
f lf d f i d ith th b i


logic of the Government s view to date.
As a matter of course, Japan’s “use of force” must be
carried out while observing international law. At the same
time, a legal basis in international law and constitutional
interpretation need to be understood separately. In
certain situations, the aforementioned “use of force”
permitted under the Constitution is, under international
law, based on the right of collective self-defense. The
Government has reached a conclusion that although this
“use of force” includes those which are triggered by an
armed attack occurring against a foreign country, they
are permitted under the Constitution, only when they are
taken as measures for self-defense which are inevitable
for ensuring Japan’s survival and protecting its people, in
other words, for defending Japan.


3 Geographic Boundaries within which the Right
of Self-Defense may be Exercised


The use of the minimum necessary force to defend Japan
under the right of self-defense is not necessarily confi ned
to the geographic boundaries of Japanese territory,
territorial waters, and airspace. However, it is diffi cult to
give a general defi nition of the actual extent to which it
may be used, as this would vary with the situation.
Nevertheless, the Government interprets that, as
a general rule, the Constitution does not permit armed
troops to be dispatched to the land, sea, or airspace of
other countries with the aim of using force; such overseas
deployment of troops would exceed the defi nition of the
minimum necessary level of self-defense.

4 Right of Belligerency


Article 9, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution prescribes
that “the right of belligerency of the state will not be
recognized.” However, the “right of belligerency” does
not mean the right to engage in battle; rather, it is a
general term for various rights that a belligerent nation has
under international law, including the authority to infl ict
casualties and damage upon the enemy’s military force
and to occupy enemy territory. On the other hand, Japan
may of course use the minimum level of force necessary
to defend itself. For example, if Japan infl icts casualties
and damage upon the enemy’s military force in exercising
its right of self-defense, this is conceptually distinguished
from the exercise of the right of belligerency, even though
those actions do not appear to be different. Occupation
of enemy territory, however, would exceed the minimum
necessary level of self-defense and is not permissible.


-----

3 Basic Policy

Under the Constitution, Japan has effi ciently built a
highly effective and joint defense force in line with the
basic principles of maintaining an exclusively defenseoriented policy and not becoming a military power that
poses a threat to other countries, while fi rmly maintaining
the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements and adhering to
the principle of civilian control of the military, observing
the Three Non-Nuclear Principles.


4 Securing Civilian Control

Civilian control refers to the priority of politics to the
military in a democratic state or democratic political
control of military strength. Japan has, by giving serious
refl ection to the regrettable state of affairs that happened
until the end of World War II, adopted the following strict
civilian control system that is entirely different from the
one under the former Constitution. Civilian control aims
to ensure that the SDF is maintained and operated in
accordance with the will of the people.[4]

The Diet, which represents Japanese nationals,
makes legislative and budgetary decisions on such
matters as the allotted number of the SDF personnel and
main organizations of the Ministry of Defense (MOD) /
the SDF. It also issues approval for defense operations of
the SDF. The function of national defense, as a general
administrative function, entirely falls under the executive
power of the Cabinet. The Constitution requires that the
Prime Minister and other Ministers of State who constitute
the Cabinet be civilians. The Prime Minister, on behalf
of the whole Cabinet, holds the authority of supreme
command and supervision of the SDF. The Minister of
Defense, who is exclusively in charge of national defense,
exercises general control and supervision over the SDF
duties. In addition, the National Security Council of
Japan under the Cabinet deliberates important matters on
national security.
At the MOD, the Minister of Defense is responsible
for issues concerning national defense, and as the head
of the MOD also controls and manages the SDF. The
Minister of Defense is assisted in policy planning and
political affairs by the State Minister of Defense, the
Parliamentary Vice-Ministers of Defense (two) and the
Senior Adviser to the Minister of Defense.[5]

In addition, the Special Advisers to the Minister of
Defense provide the Minister of Defense with advice on
important issues under the jurisdiction of the MOD based
on their expertise and experience. The Defense Council
consisting of political appointees, civilian offi cials and
uniformed SDF personnel of the MOD deliberates on
basic principles concerning administrative affairs under
the Ministry’s jurisdiction.
Through these ways, the MOD aims to further


1 Exclusively Defense-Oriented Policy

The exclusively defense-oriented policy means that
defensive force is used only in the event of an attack,
that the extent of the use of defensive force is kept to the
minimum necessary for self-defense, and that the defense
capabilities to be possessed and maintained by Japan are
limited to the minimum necessary for self-defense. The
policy including these matters refers to the posture of a
passive defense strategy in accordance with the spirit of
the Constitution.


2 Not Becoming a Military Power


There is no established defi nition for the concept of a
military power. For Japan, however, not becoming a
military power that could threaten other countries means
that Japan will not possess and maintain a military
capability strong enough to pose a threat to other countries,
beyond the minimum necessary for self-defense.

3 Non-Nuclear Principles


The Three Non-Nuclear Principles refers to those of
not possessing nuclear weapons, not producing them,
and not allowing them to be brought into Japan. Japan
adheres to the Three Non-Nuclear Principles as a fixed
line of national policy. Japan is also prohibited from
manufacturing and possessing nuclear weapons under
the Atomic Energy Basic Law.[2] In addition, Japan
ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons (NPT), and as a non-nuclear weapons state,
has an obligation not to manufacture and acquire
nuclear weapons.[3]


Article 2 of the Atomic Energy Basic Law states that “The research, development and utilization of atomic energy shall be limited to peaceful purposes, aimed at ensuring safety and performed
independently under democratic management.”

Article 2 of the NPT states that “Each non-nuclear weapon State Party to the Treaty undertakes....not to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices...”

The Cabinet’s control over military matters was limited.

enhance the operation of the civilian control system.
As mentioned above, the civilian control system
is well established. However, in order to ensure that
the system achieves good results, it is necessary to
continue making practical efforts in both political and
administrative aspects, along with a deep interest in
national defense taken by the people.

**Section 3 Outline of the National Security Strategy**


1 National Security Council

As the security environment surrounding Japan grows
increasingly severe, Japan faces mounting security
challenges it needs to address. Under such circumstances,
it is necessary to carry forward the policies pertaining to
national security from a strategic perspective under strong
political leadership with the Prime Minister at its core. For
this reason, the National Security Council was established
in the Cabinet in December 2013 to provide a platform to
discuss important matters with regard to Japan’s security.
Since its establishment, the Council has met 179 times (as
of the end of June 2018) and has been serving as a control
tower for foreign and defense policies. The National
Security Strategy (NSS) and the National Defense Program
Guidelines (NDPG) are also deliberated and approved in
this National Security Council.
The National Security Secretariat established
within the Cabinet Secretariat provides constant support
to the National Security Council as its secretariat. The
Secretariat is also tasked with planning and designing,
and overall coordination of basic guidelines and


important matters with regard to foreign and defense
policies pertaining to national security. Administrative
organs that are deeply involved in policies support the
Secretariat with both personnel and information. The
Secretariat has many civilians and uniformed personnel
of the MOD with concurrent posts, who are engaged
in the planning and designing of policies, as well as
the utilization of respective specialized knowledge. In
addition, information such as global military trends are
shared in a timely manner.
The enhanced ability to plan and design national
security policies has led to systematic alignment of
Japan’s national security, and to providing a direction
for policies with regard to new security challenges.
Furthermore, individual defense policies are formulated
and efforts to expedite decision-making are made based
on the basic guidelines discussed at the National Security
Council, and this is contributing signifi cantly to improved
planning and execution of policies within the MOD.

2 National Security Strategy


1 Japan’s National Security Policy Framework

The NSS approved by the National Security Council and
the Cabinet in December of 2013 represents Japan’s fi rst
ever basic policy on national security with a focus on
diplomatic affairs and defense policy. The NSS defi nes
approaches that Japan should follow based on a long-term
view of its national interests. It replaces the Basic Policy
on National Defense, which had served as the basis for
Japan’s defense policies theretofore.
The NDPG, which was established based on the NSS,
defi nes basic policies for Japan’s future defense, the role
of its defense capabilities, and objectives for specifi c SDF
equipment. The NDPG was formulated with a mediumto-long-term outlook because the acquisition of defense
equipment and the establishment of troop operational
systems cannot be accomplished overnight and requires
many years of planning. The NSS and NDPG are mainly
designed for the next decade or so.
The Medium Term Defense Program (MTDP)
specifi es a maximum budget and the amount of mainstay
defense equipment to be acquired over the subsequent
fi ve-year period in order to achieve the defense capability
targets defi ned in the NDPG. The fi scal year budget
is drawn on the MTDP substantiated as projects, and
the necessary expenses for each fi scal year will be
appropriated based on relevant situations.
To date, the NDPG has contained mention of
nationwide basic security policies focusing on defense
policy to a certain extent. The NSS carries it with great


meaning as the defi nitive statement of the Government’s
basic policy on national security, with a focus on
diplomatic affairs and defense policy.

Outline of the National Security Strategy:

the Principle of International Cooperation


2 Proactive Contribution to Peace based on


Japan is committed to continuing the path it has followed
to date as a peace-loving nation and, as a major player in
international politics and business, it also seeks its own
security as well as peace and security in the Asia-Pacifi c
region from its stance as a Proactive Contribution to Peace
based on the principle of international cooperation. Japan will
contribute more proactively than ever before to the peace,
security and prosperity of the international community.
In achieving the aforementioned fundamental
principle of national security, the NSS stipulates national
interests and goals, and presents a strategic approach that
needs to be employed.

Since it was fi rst developed in 1976, the National Defense
Program Guidelines (NDPG) has been established fi ve
times. The current National Defense Program Guidelines
FY2014 and beyond was introduced in 2013.[1] The NDPG
is a “grand design” to ensure peace and security of Japan,
which establishes the posture of Japan’s defense forces

and the level to achieve based on the security environment
and the changes in military situation surrounding Japan.
Therefore, the NDGP must squarely face the reality of
security environment all the time and set forth the defense
forces which are truly needed to protect the Japanese people.

security in light of Japan s geographical characteristics[2]
under the new security environment.[3]

Amid the increasingly severe security environment
surrounding Japan, the number and the duration of
situations, including so-called “gray-zone” situations
(see Part 1, Chapter 1, Section1), which require the Self
Defense Forces (SDF)’ commitment are both increasing.
Among these situations, the qualitative and
quantitative capabilities of the defense force underpinning
the SDF activities were not necessarily suffi cient. The
NDPG, being fully mindful of these needs, calls for the
enhancement of deterrence and response capability by
pursuing further joint operations, improving the missioncapable rate of equipment and its employment to conduct
activities, as well as developing defense capabilities

2 Japan’s Basic Defense Policy


adequate both in quality and quantity that underpin
various activities. To this end, Japan has conducted
capability assessments based on joint operations in
relation to the SDF’s total functions and capabilities, in
order to identify the functions and capabilities that should
be comprehensively prioritized. The NDPG carries great
signifi cance as it has made it possible to adapt to an everchanging security environment surrounding Japan, and
realize a more prioritized and effi cient defense capability
build-up, based on the results of these capability
assessments. Additionally, it requires the build-up of the
most effective operational posture, by further strengthening
a wide-ranging logistics support foundation.[4]

[See] Reference 6 (NATIONAL DEFENSE PROGRAM GUIDELINES for

[See]

FY2014 and beyond)


1 Basic Policy

In light of the NSS, Japan will build a comprehensive
defense architecture, and actively promote bilateral and
multilateral security cooperation with other countries
while strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance, thereby
seeking to establish an infrastructure necessary for fully
exercising its defense capabilities.
Under the Constitution, Japan will effi ciently build
a highly effective and joint defense force in line with the
basic principles of maintaining an exclusively defenseoriented policy, not becoming a military power that poses
a threat to other countries, while adhering to the principle
of civilian control of the military and observing the Three
Non-Nuclear Principles.
Additionally, with regard to the threat of nuclear
weapons, the extended deterrence provided by the United
States is indispensable. Japan will closely cooperate with
the United States, and take appropriate responses through
its own efforts. In addition, Japan will play a constructive
and active role in international nuclear disarmament and
non-proliferation efforts.


2 Japan’s Own Efforts


Given the increasingly severe security environment, Japan
will effi ciently develop a highly effective joint defense
force and make efforts to employ it with a high level of
fl exibility and readiness based on joint operations. In
the event of various situations, Japan will appropriately
and promptly make decisions and seamlessly respond to
situations as they unfold, in a whole-of-the-government
approach, in coordination with local governments, private
sectors, and others.
Furthermore, Japan will continue to develop various
systems to respond to a variety of disasters and protect
its people, and will enhance the capability to ensure the
safety of Japanese nationals in foreign countries in an
emergency situation.
In order to take such approaches appropriately, Japan
will increase the effectiveness of its situation and disaster
response posture by systemizing various related plans
and expanding the use of simulations, comprehensive
training, and exercises.
Furthermore, Japan will make efforts to build up
a Dynamic Joint Defense Force as mentioned above,
in addition to the establishment of a comprehensive
defense architecture.


The NDPG discusses that Japan’s geographical characteristics make it a maritime state, therefore, securing the safety of maritime and air traffi c constitutes the basis of peace and prosperity. It also
states that Japan faces security vulnerabilities such as frequent natural disasters, concentration of population, and a large number of nuclear power plants in coastal areas.

The NDPG describes new trends in the global security environment and the security environment of the Asia-Pacifi c region. With regard to the new trends in the global security environment, it
mentions: 1) expanded and deepened interdependence among countries; 2) increase in the number of gray-zone situations; 3) change in the power balance; 4) undue infringement upon freedom of
the high seas; and 5) securing the stable use of outer space and cyberspace. With regard to the trends in the security environment of the Asia-Pacifi c region, it lists general situations, including that
gray-zone situations tend to linger and could develop into more serious situations. In addition, the NDPG discusses military trends in North Korea, China, Russia and the United States.

Specifi cally, the NDPG calls for the strengthening of various fi elds as the basic foundation for the SDF in areas such as training and exercise, operational infrastructure, personnel and education,
medical care, defense production, technological bases, effi cient acquisition of equipment, research and development, collaboration with local communities, communication capabilities, intellectual

expand the range of countries receiving support as well
as its scope.
Furthermore, in multilateral security cooperation
and dialogue, Japan, in cooperation with the United
States and Australia, will proactively contribute to
building cooperative relationships in the region, and
Japan will actively participate in multilateral joint
training and exercises.

**(2) Cooperation with the International Community**
It is very diffi cult for a single country to respond to
global security challenges on its own. Moreover, as the
roles of military forces have diversifi ed, such forces
play an important role in building peace and promoting
confi dence-building. Therefore, Japan will continue
and strengthen various initiatives concerning arms
control, disarmament, non-proliferation and capacity
building assistance on a regular basis in cooperation
with the international community. Specifi cally, Japan
will strengthen its cooperation with the European Union
(EU), North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe
(OSCE), along with the United Kingdom, France and
other European countries. Furthermore, Japan will
actively promote various international peace cooperation
activities in a multi-layered manner, and in particular,
will continue to actively conduct activities utilizing the
SDF’s capabilities.


3 Strengthening of the Japan-U.S. Alliance


The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, together with
Japan’s own efforts, constitute the cornerstone for Japan’s
national security. Also, the Japan-U.S. Alliance functions
as public goods that contribute to the stability and
prosperity not only of Japan, but also of the Asia-Pacifi c
region and the world at large. From this perspective,
Japan will place emphasis on: strengthening deterrence
and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S. Alliance;
strengthening and expanding of cooperation in a broad
range of fi elds; and steady implementation of measures
relating to the stationing of the U.S. Forces in Japan.

4 Active Promotion of Security Cooperation


**(1) Cooperation in the Asia-Pacifi c Region**
Japan will promote a variety of cooperative initiatives
in a multi-layered manner to ease the atmosphere of
confrontation and the sense of curiosity towards one
another in the Asia-Pacifi c region. In particular, with
regard to the Republic of Korea (ROK), Australia and
India, Japan will make efforts to improve cooperation
and interoperability. Japan will also endeavor to promote
dialogue and exchanges with China and Russia.
Additionally, with regard to capacity building
assistance, Japan will promote and carry it out in full
coordination with diplomatic policy initiatives, including
Offi cial Development Assistance (ODA), and Japan will


3 Future Defense Force Japan Should Achieve

1 Roles of the Defense Forces


**(1) Effective Deterrent of and Response to Various**
**Situations**

Japan will achieve intelligence superiority[5] through
persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
(ISR) activities in an extensive surrounding area to detect
any signs of development at an early stage. Through such
activities, Japan will clearly express its resolve not to
tolerate any change of the status quo by force, thereby
preventing various situations from occurring.
At the same time, Japan will swiftly and seamlessly
respond to situations from an early stage, including grayzone situations, and establish the necessary posture to
continuously address a protracted situation. Moreover,


Japan will implement an effective response tailored to
each situation, even in cases when multiple events occur
in a consecutive or concurrent manner.
In particular, the following points will be emphasized:
(1) ensuring security of the sea and airspace surrounding
Japan; (2) response to an attack on remote islands;
(3) response to ballistic missile attacks; (4) responses in outer
space and cyberspace; and (5) responses to major disasters.

**(2) Stabilization of the Asia-Pacifi c Region and**
**Improvement of the Global Security Environment**

Through persistent ISR in the area surrounding
Japan, and the timely and appropriate implementation
of training, exercises, and various other activities, Japan
will ensure the stability of the security environment in


-----

the region. Moreover, by working in partnership with
its allies and partners, Japan will promote multi-tiered
initiatives, including bilateral and multilateral defense
cooperation and exchange, joint training and exercises,
and capacity building assistance.
In order to respond appropriately to global security
issues, Japan will strengthen various initiatives focused
on arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation, as
well as actively promote international peace cooperation
activities, anti-piracy initiatives and capacity building
assistance. Japan will attach importance to the following in
particular: (1) holding training and exercises; (2) promoting
defense cooperation and exchange; (3) promoting capacity
building assistance; (4) ensuring maritime security;
(5) implementing international peace cooperation
activities; and (6) cooperating with efforts to promote arms
control, disarmament, and non-proliferation.


in relation to various potential contingencies, the SDF
will prioritize the development of capacities to ensure
maritime superiority and air superiority, which is the
prerequisite for effective deterrence and response in
various situations, including defense posture buildup
in the southwestern region. Furthermore, the SDF
will emphasize the establishment of rapid deployment
capabilities with a consideration to establishing a wideranging logistics support foundation.
At the same time, in terms of preparation for an
invasion such as the landing of large-scale ground forces,
the SDF will possess the minimum necessary level of
expertise and skills, and thereby further promote efforts
to achieve even greater effi ciency and rationalization.

**(2) Functions and Capabilities to be Emphasized**
The SDF will selectively strengthen the following
functions and capabilities in particular, paying attention
to enhance joint functions with interoperability with the
U.S. Forces.

As for Fighter Units, the 13th squadron will be
newly established, and Air Reconnaissance Unit will be
abolished. In addition, one squadron will be added to
the Aerial Refueling/Transport Unit, making it a twosquadron architecture.
Furthermore, the ASDF will maintain surface-to-air
guided missile units providing multi-layered defense for
Japan against ballistic missile attacks, together with the
Aegis destroyers, as well as protecting key areas in tandem
with the surface-to-air guided missile units of the GSDF.

[See] Fig. II-2-1-3 (NDPG Comparison Tables)


3 Architecture of Each Service of
the Self-Defense Forces

**(1) Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF)**
In order to respond swiftly to an attack on remote islands
and various other situations, the GSDF will maintain
rapidly deployable basic operational units furnished
with advanced mobility and ISR capabilities (rapid
deployment divisions, rapid deployment brigades, and an
armored division). In addition, the GSDF will maintain
mobile operating units capable of effectively performing
amphibious and other operations. The GSDF will maintain
half of these rapidly deployable basic operational units in
Hokkaido, given its excellent training environment.
The GSDF will implement rationalization and
streamlining with a particular focus on tanks/howitzers
and rockets, and review the organization and equipment
of units.
The number of GSDF personnel will be maintained at
around 159,000, which was the same level as at the end of
FY2013, in order to ensure suffi cient personnel availability
to respond to major disasters or other situations.

4 Basic Foundation for the SDF


To ensure that the defense force can function as
effectively as possible, it is also imperative to strengthen
the foundations underpinning the defense force.

[See] Fig. II-2-1-4 (Basic Structure to Maximize defense Capability)



[See]


5 Additional Points


The NDPG sets out the form of Japan’s defense
capabilities over the next decade or so. The National
Security Council will conduct regular, systematic
review over the course of implementation of the various
measures and programs. In addition, smooth, swift and
accurate transition to the future defense capabilities
will be facilitated through validations based on joint
operational capability assessment. When major changes
in the situation are anticipated during the review and
verifi cation process, necessary examination considering
the security environment at that time will be implemented
and these guidelines will be revised adequately. In light
of the increasingly severe fi scal conditions, Japan will
strive to achieve greater effi ciency and streamlining in the
defense capability buildup while ensuring harmony with
other national initiatives.


**(2) Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF)**
The MSDF will increase the number of destroyers to 54
(14 escort divisions) by using new destroyers that offer
improved response capabilities for various missions
and have more compact designs, and will maintain
ship-based patrol helicopter units in order to secure the
defense of surrounding waters and ensure the safety of
maritime traffi c. Furthermore, two Destroyers equipped
with the Aegis Weapon System will be added, bringing
the fl eet to eight.
Furthermore, in order to effectively carry out regular
information gathering, and warning and surveillance
activities, as well as patrolling of surrounding waters[6]
and defense operations, the MSDF will maintain an
augmented submarine fl eet and patrol aircraft units.

**(3) Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF)**
The ASDF will maintain air warning and control units
in order to provide persistent ISR in most air space
over Japan and the surrounding areas. By consolidating
warning and control operations at air defense command
centers, the ASDF will gradually change warning groups
into warning squadrons as well as establish one new
squadron in the air warning unit.

4 Future Considerations


The security environment surrounding Japan is becoming
increasingly severe at a pace much faster than when the
current NDPG was set forth. As exemplifi ed by North
Korea’s nuclear and missile development, China’s
military build-up lacking transparency as well as forceful
and unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the
East and South China Sea, the proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction, and escalating terrorism throughout

Fig. II-2-1-3 NDPG Comparison Tables


the world, the international community today faces broad
and diverse security challenges. Of all these challenges,
new areas of activities such as cyberspace and outer
space require particular attention. With that being said,
Japan’s security policy rests on our own effort, and it is
required of Japan to boost its defense capabilities and try
to expand its roles.

to the 196th Session of the Diet in January 2018 that the
Government would, while maintaining the exclusively
defense-oriented policy as given, revise the NDPG. In
the background is the imperative to identify defense
capabilities that are truly needed to protect the Japanese
people, and in doing so, the Government must squarely
face the harsh reality in Japan’s surroundings rather than
simply extending the existing capabilities.
As the current Mid-Term Defense Program (MTDP)
ends in FY2018, the Government is reviewing the NDPG

In reviewing the current NDPG, it is critical to
secure necessary and suffi cient “quality” and “quantity”
of defense capability. Given that the utilization of new
domains, such as cyberspace and outer space is especially
vital, the conventional method of categorization, namely
land, sea, and airspace is no longer relevant, and Japan
must fully commit itself to improve capabilities in these
new areas.

|Category|Main measures|
|---|---|
|Training and Exercises|● Expand the use of the good training environment in Hokkaido; enhance and strengthen training and exercises that also involve relevant agencies and the civilian sector. ● Promote the joint/shared use of U.S. Forces facilities in the southwestern region with the SDF for the purpose of securing a good training environment while paying close attention to the relationship with local communities.|

**Section 2 Outline of the Medium Term Defense Program**


1 Program Guidelines

Based on the NDPG, the Mid-Term Defense Program
(FY2014-FY2018) (MTDP) states that an appropriate
defense buildup is to be achieved under the following six
basic program guidelines.

[See] Fig. II-2-2-1 (6 Basic Guidelines of the Mid-Term Defense

[See]

Program)


In reinforcing the structure of the SDF, Japan
will prioritize the improvement of the 9 functions and
capabilities which the NDPG specifi es as those that
should be emphasized, and aim to build highly effective
integrated defense forces in an effi cient manner.

and airspace surrounding Japan; response to attacks on
remote islands; response to ballistic missile attacks, while
also focusing on ensuring technological superiority, and
the maintenance and enhancement of defense production
and technological bases to steadily build-up defense
capabilities for a dynamic joint defense force.
Furthermore, considering the increasingly severe
situation in Japan’s public fi nance, Japan will strive to
achieve greater effi ciencies and streamlining through
efforts such as longer-term contracts, while harmonizing
these efforts with other measures taken by the Government.
In light of the outcome of the U.S.-North Korea
Summit Meeting held in June 2018, Japan believes it
is important for the international community to stay


united and make efforts to ensure the complete, verifi able
and irreversible dismantlement of all weapons of mass
destruction and ballistic missiles of all ranges by North
Korea, and we must watch North Korea’s future concrete
actions closely. It is no surprise that the MOD, whose
responsibility is to protect the lives and property of the
nationals, needs to be fully ready to be able to respond to
any contingencies or situations. The MOD will continue
to carry forward various programs, including the initiative
to introduce Aegis Ashore, which is allocated in the
FY2018 budget.

Commentary Deployment of stand-off missiles **COLUMN**

Japan introduces stand-off missiles to effectively defend our country ensuring the safety of Self Defense Forces (SDF) personnel and
in light of the increasingly severe national security environment.
Given signifi cant expansion of radar coverage and anti-aircraft missile range due to signifi cant advances in military technologies
in various countries, S D F jets are currently compelled to respond within the range of these threats. Deployment of stand-off missiles
enables SDF to respond from outside the range. As a result, SDF will be able to respond to invading forces while protecting the safety
of SDF personnel.
Stand-off missile, which is vital to Japan’s defense while protecting the safety of SDF personnel, is necessary to take out hostile
forces when Japan is armed-attacked by the forces and is minimum necessary equipment for self defense.

**Section 4 Defense-Related Expenditures**


1 Overview of Defense-Related Expenditures


Defense-related expenditures include expenses for
improving defense capabilities and maintaining and
managing the SDF, as well as expenses necessary for
the implementation of measures against neighborhood
affairs in the vicinity of defense facilities. Defenserelated expenditures have been on a hike for 6 years
in a row since FY2014, including the duration of the
current MTDP under which defense expenditures are set
to increase by 0.8% in real average over the course of
fi ve years.
In comparison with the previous fi scal year, defenserelated expenditures for FY2018 were increased by
39.2 billion yen to 4.9388 trillion yen. When including
expenses related to Special Action Committee on

Okinawa (SACO) and the U.S. Forces realignmentrelated expenses (the portion allocated for mitigating
the impact on local communities) and expense for the
introduction of new government aircraft, defense-related
expenditures were increased by 66 billion yen from the
previous fi scal year to 5.1911 trillion yen.
Additionally, the supplementary budget for FY2018
contains an appropriation of 234.5 billion yen as necessary
expenses for securing stable operations of the SDF, which
includes responding to ballistic missile attacks.

expenses are further classifi ed into “obligatory outlay
expenses,”[1] which are paid based on contracts concluded
in previous fi scal years, and “general material expenses,”
which are paid under current-year contracts. Material
expenses are also referred to as “program expenses,” and
since general material expenses include repair costs for
equipment, education and training expenses for personal,


Defense-related expenditures are broadly classifi ed into
“personnel and food provision expenses,” which covers
items such as wages and meals for SDF personnel,
and “material expenses,” which fi nance the repair
and maintenance of equipment, the purchase of fuel,
the education and training of SDF personnel and the
procurement of equipment and the others. Material

Note: Does not include SACO-related expenses, U.S. Forces realignment-related expenses (the portion allocated for mitigating the impact on local communities), and expense for the
introduction of new government aircraft based on “The Policy Concerning Government Aircraft” (August 7, 2013 decision by the Review Committee on Government Aircraft). If these
are included, the fi gures are 5,125.1 billion yen for FY2017 and 5,191.1 billion yen for FY2018; and for future obligation, 4,872.6 billion yen for FY2017 and 5,076.8 billion yen for
FY2018. Figures may not add up to the total due to rounding.


In the build-up of defense capabilities, there are things that span multiple years. In these cases, the fi scal year in which the contract is concluded is different from the fi scal year in which the payment to
the contractor is made. Therefore, the future maximum obligation is allocated to the budget as a contract resulting in Treasury obligation (type of budget that only grant an authority to incur obligations.
The contracts can be concluded, although the payment cannot be made). Based on such budgeting, in principle in the fi scal year the construction is completed or the equipment is procured, expenses
necessary for payment are allocated as budget expenditure (type of budget that grant authorities to incur obligations and make payment. The contracts can be concluded and the payment can be
made). Budget expenditure for payments incurred under contracts concluded in previous fi scal years is called “obligatory outlay expenses,” while expenditure for the future fi scal years is termed

Amount of future obligation

When improving defense capabilities, it is common for work in areas like the procurement
of equipment and the upgrading of facilities to be carried out over several years.
Consequently, a procedure is undertaken whereby a contract that extends for multiple
years is arranged (five years in principle), and the government promises in advance at the
time of the agreement to make the payment at a fixed time in the future.
Future obligation refers to the sum of money to be paid in the following year and beyond
under such contracts, which extend for multiple years. Example: A case in which 10 billion
yen of equipment is procured under a contract that runs for four years

For this reason, the breakdown of the defense-related
expenditures cannot be easily altered in a signifi cant

[See] Fig. II-2-4-3 (Relationship between Annual Expenditure and

Future Obligation Concerning New Contracts)

Personnel and food provision expenses were
increased by 18.7 billion yen from the previous fi scal year,
while obligatory outlay expenses for the year increased
by 22.6 billion yen. General material expenses decreased
by 2.1 billion yen from the previous fi scal year.[2]

[See] Fig. II-2-4-4 (Breakdown of Defense-Related Expenditures

FY2018)
Reference 14 (Changes in Composition of Defense-Related
Expenditures (Original Budget Basis)

In addition to the annual budget expenditure, the
amount of future obligations concerning new contracts
also indicates payments for the following year and beyond
(the amount of future obligation arising in the applicable
fi scal year). In the build-up of defense capabilities, it is


common to take multiple years from contract to delivery
or completion, in areas such as the procurement of
vessels, aircraft, and other primary equipment, as well
as the construction of buildings such as aircraft hangars
and barracks. Consequently, for such items, a procedure
is undertaken whereby a multi-year contract is arranged,
and it is promised in advance at the time of the contract
that payments will be made in the following fi scal year
and beyond (within fi ve years, in principle). The sum of
money to be paid in the following fi scal year and beyond,
based on such a multi-year contract, is called the “future
obligation.” The amount of future obligation concerning
new contracts arising in FY2018 increased from the
previous fi scal year by 23.8 billion yen (1.2%).
Furthermore, if looked at on a contract basis,[3] which
shows the scale of operations, there is an increase from
the previous fi scal year of 21.7 billion yen (0.7%).

Notes: 1. The 61.6 billion yen reduction from introducing the Patriot system capable of carrying and operating PAC-3MSE missiles, which was appropriated in the third supplementary budget
for FY2016, is included in the reduction amount for FY2017.
2. The reduction from projects that were moved up to be appropriated in the fi rst supplementary budget for FY2017 is included in the reduction amount for FY2018.
3. Figures may not add up to the total due to rounding.


For this purpose, the MOD is currently carrying out
reviews to achieve effi ciency, and has sought a reduction
of approximately 573 billion yen from FY2014 to
FY2017 through the following measures: 1) utilize longterm contracts (Part III, Chapter 4, Section 3); 2) review
maintenance methods; 3) use of civilian goods and
review of specifi cations; 4) bulk purchase of equipment;
5) scrutiny of the prime cost. Furthermore, approximately
197 billion yen of cost reduction is expected in the
FY2018 budget. Concrete initiatives introduced in the
FY2018 budget are as follows.
-  A reduction of approximately 5 billion yen by making
an over fi ve-years long-term contract of Performance
Based Logistics (PBL) (Part III, Chap.) for maintenance
equipment of the F110 engine (fi ghter (F-2)).

-  A reduction of approximately 68.5 billion yen through
a review of maintenance methods including extending
regular maintenance intervals for the engine of F7-10
(fi xed-wing patrol aircraft {P-1}).

-  A reduction of approximately 16.6 billion yen by
pursuing cost savings through the use of civilian goods
and review of specifi cations of equipment such as the
maintenance of the tactical network control system
(TNCS).

-  A reduction of approximately 37.1 yen through bulk
procurement of equipment in a single fi scal year that
could lead to a reduction in expenses.

**and Security and the SDF Activities**
**since Legislation’s Enforcement**


**Section 1** **[Background to the Development of Legislation ]**
**for Peace and Security**


1 Background to the Development of Legislation

The security environment surrounding Japan is increasingly
severe, and we are now in an era where threats could
easily spread beyond national borders, and no country can
maintain its own security only by itself any longer.
Against this background, it is fi rst and foremost
important to advance vibrant diplomacy in order to
maintain peace and security of Japan, and ensure its
survival, as well as to secure its people’s lives. However,
at the same time, it is also necessary to prepare for the
worst-case scenario.
Specifi cally, it is essential to avoid armed confl icts
beforehand and prevent threats from reaching Japan by
appropriately developing, maintaining and operating
Japan’s own defense capability, strengthening mutual
cooperation with the United States which is Japan’s ally,
and other partner countries, and in particular, further
elevating the effectiveness of the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements and enhancing the deterrence of the JapanU.S. Alliance for the peace and stability of Japan and the
Asia-Pacifi c region.
On that basis, in order to resolutely secure the lives


and peaceful livelihood of its people under any situation
and contribute even more proactively to the peace and
stability of the international community under the policy of
“Proactive Contribution to Peace” based on the principle
of international cooperation, it is necessary to develop
domestic legislation that enables seamless responses.
In May 2014, following a report submitted by the
Advisory Panel on the Reconstruction of the Legal Basis
for Security and in accordance with the basic orientation
for the way that further deliberations would take place as
presented by Prime Minister Abe, discussions were held
in the ruling parties and studies were also conducted by
the Government.[1] Following this, in July 2014, a Cabinet
Decision was made on “Development of Seamless
Security Legislation to Ensure Japan’s Survival and
Protect its People,” which set forth the basic policy for
the development of legislation that enables seamless
responses to any situations.

[See] Reference 16 (Development of Seamless Security Legislation

to Ensure Japan’s Survival and Protect its People)


2 Background and Signifi cance of the Development of Legislature


Following the aforementioned Cabinet Decision, a
legislation drafting team was launched under the National
Security Secretariat in the Cabinet Secretariat. In
addition, the Ministry of Defense established “The Study
Committee on the Development of Security Legislation”
with the Minister of Defense as its Chairman, and
conducted the deliberations towards the development of
security legislation. The deliberations in the Government
were conducted based on the discussions at a total of 25
meetings in the ruling parties, and, on May 14, 2015,


the Government made Cabinet Decisions on two bills,
the Bill for the Development of Legislation for Peace
and Security[2] and the International Peace Support Bill.[3]
The two bills were then submitted to the 189th ordinary
session of the Diet on May 15, 2015.
These two bills enable seamless responses to
any situations, from the protection of assets including
weapons of units of the U.S. Forces and armed forces
of foreign countries during peacetime, support activities
to armed forces of foreign countries, etc., in situations


In February 2013, Prime Minister Abe resumed the Advisory Panel on Reconstruction of the Legal Basis for Security, which had been held during the fi rst Abe Cabinet. Following a total of seven
meetings, the Advisory Panel submitted its report to Prime Minister Abe in May 2014.

Bill for Partial Amendments to the Self-Defense Forces Law and Other Existing Laws for Ensuring Peace and Security of Japan and the International Community.

that have an important infl uence on Japan s peace and
security and situations that the international community
is collectively addressing for peace and security (to
be discussed later), to the limited use of the right of
collective self-defense as a measure for self-defense to
the minimum extent necessary to defend Japan when the
“Three New Conditions”[4] are satisfi ed.
Following the longest extension of a Diet session in
the postwar, the longest Diet debate of security-related
bills in the postwar period was conducted, constituting
about 116 hours of debate in the House of Representatives
and about 100 hours of debate in the House of Councillors,
totaling about 216 hours. As a result, the two bills were
passed at a plenary session of the House of Councillors
and enacted on September 19, 2015, upon formation of
a broad consensus, with approval of not only the Liberal
Democratic Party of Japan and Komeito but also the
three opposition parties of the then Assembly to Energize
Japan, the then Party for Future Generations and the then
New Renaissance Party (altogether fi ve parties out of the
ten political parties).
Just before the passage, these fi ve parties reached the
“Agreement Concerning the Legislation for Peace and
Security” (the “Five-Party Agreement”), which include
matters that should be taken into consideration in judging
the applicability of the Three New Conditions related


to the recognition of a survival-threatening situation,
and committed them to obtaining a conclusion on the
shape of a Diet organization for the constant surveillance
and post—verifi cation of SDF activities based on the
Legislation for Peace and Security, and the strengthening
of the Diet’s involvement. The Government also made
a Cabinet Decision to the effect that the Government
will respect the Five-Party Agreement and handle these
matters appropriately. The Legislation for Peace and
Security was put into force on March 29, 2016.
With the security environment surrounding Japan
becoming increasingly severe, the enforcement of the
Legislation for Peace and Security has a historical
signifi cance. The legislation, which enables the SDF to
provide protection and logistic support to U.S. naval vessels
engaged in ballistic missile defense, helps strengthen
the deterrence and response capability of the Japan-U.S.
Alliance as a whole, thereby further ensuring the peace
and security of Japan through making more proactive
contributions to the peace and stability of the region and
the international community. The Legislation has been
highly appraised around the world. This fact clearly shows
that the Legislation contributes to the peace and stability of
the region and the international community.[5]

Commentary Enhanced deterrent through peace and security legislation **COLUMN**

Peace and security legislation implemented two years ago improved content that enables broader cooperating with the United States
and other related countries than previously, such as expanding the scope of activities for which supplies and services can be provided
to US troops operating in the same theater as Self Defense Forces.
In 2017, Japan delivered supplies and services to US troops collecting intelligence and provided protection to forces from other
countries collaborating with Self Defense Force troops in activities that benefi t Japan’s defense.
These activities reinforced the Japan-US alliance and bolstered Japan’s deterrence. The peace and security legislation hence
has clearly brought increased certainty to Japan’s national security. The government intends to continue to put utmost efforts into
protecting the lives and peaceful existence of the Japanese people.



Commentary The Relationship between the Legislation for Peace and Security **COLUMN**

and the Constitution

The “use of force” is permitted under the Constitution

-  **When an armed attack against Japan occurs or when an armed attack against a foreign country that**
**is in a close relationship with Japan occurs and as a result threatens Japan’s survival and poses a clear**
**danger to fundamentally overturn people’s right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness;**

-  **When there is no other appropriate means available to repel the attack and ensure Japan’s survival and**
**protect its people; and**

-  **Use of force is limited to the minimum extent necessary,**

only when the Three New Conditions above are satisfi ed. Even for the “use of force” permitted under the Three New Conditions, the
basic logic of the constitutional interpretation presented in the Governmental view of 1972 (below) has not changed:

-  **The language of Article 9 of the Constitution appears to prohibit the “use of force” in international**
**relations in all forms. However, when considered in light of “the right (of all peoples of the world)**
**to live in peace” as recognized in the Preamble of the Constitution and the purpose of Article 13 of**
**the Constitution which stipulates, “their (all of the people’s) right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of**
**happiness” shall be the supreme consideration in governmental affairs, Article 9 of the Constitution**
**cannot possibly be interpreted to prohibit Japan from taking measures of self-defense necessary to**
**maintain its peace and security and to ensure its survival.**

-  **Such measures for self-defense are permitted only when they are inevitable for dealing with imminent**
**unlawful situations where the people’s right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is fundamentally**
**overturned due to an armed attack by a foreign country, and for safeguarding these rights of the people.**
**Hence, the “use of force” to the minimum extent necessary to that end is permitted.**

Furthermore, the “use of force” permitted under the Three New Conditions remains within the scope of the Supreme Court
decision on the Sunagawa Case. The Supreme Court decision states that

-  **“it must be pointed out that it is natural for Japan, in the exercise of powers inherent in a state, to take**
**measures for self-defense that may be necessary to maintain its peace and security, and to ensure its survival.”**

In other words, the decision can be interpreted as recognizing that Japan should be able to take “measures for self-defense”
to maintain its peace and security and ensure its survival after stating that Japan has the right to self-defense, without making a
distinction between the right to individual self-defense and the right to collective self-defense.
As the Legislation for Peace and Security, which refl ects the Three New Conditions described above in just proportion, maintains
the basic logic of the constitutional interpretation hitherto presented by the Government and remains within the scope of the
Sunagawa Case decision by the Supreme Court, the only institution endowed with the power to fi nally determine the constitutional
interpretation, it is consistent with the Constitution.

1 Responses to Armed Attack Situations, etc., and Survival-Threatening Situations


The Act on the Peace and Independence of Japan and
Maintenance of the Nation and the People’s Security
in Armed Attack Situations, etc., and a SurvivalThreatening Situation[2] specifi es items that should be
stipulated as basic principles and basic policies (the
Basic Response Plan) regarding responses to Armed
Attack Situation and Anticipated Armed Attack Situation,
etc., and Survival-Threatening Situations as well as the
responsibilities of national and local governments in the
event of an armed attack.
Previously, the aforementioned legislation stipulated
responses to Armed Attack Situations, etc. However,
considering the changes in the security environment
surrounding Japan, a “Survival-Threatening Situation”
was newly added to the situations to which Japan is to
respond as an armed attack since even if it occurs against a
foreign country it could threaten Japan’s survival as well,
depending on its purpose, scale and manner. Following
this, the SDF Law was also amended to defi ne responses
to such a situation as one of the SDF’s primary duties


as unavoidable self-defense measures for Japan’s defense
along with some other changes.


1 Armed Attack Situations, etc. and SurvivalThreatening Situations


**(1) Basic Response Plan etc.**
In situations such as an Armed Attack Situations, etc.,
or a Survival-Threatening Situation, the Government is
required to adopt the Basic Response Plan, which includes
the following items, and ask for approval by the Diet.
In addition, once the Basic Response Plan is adopted, a
temporary Task Force for Armed Attack Situations, etc.,
(the Task Force) is to be established within the Cabinet,
to implement these measures.
(1) The following items concerning situations that need
to be dealt with:
a. Sequence of the event the situation, the confi rmation
of occurrence of an Armed Attack Situation, etc.,
or a Survival-Threatening Situation, and the facts
that support this confi rmation
b. When the situation is confi rmed as an Armed Attack
Situation, etc., or a Survival-Threatening Situation,



**[KEY WORD]**

Survival-Threatening Situation

A Survival-Threatening Situation means a situation where an armed

attack against a foreign country that is in a close relationship with

Japan occurs, which in turn poses a clear risk of threatening Japan’s
survival and of overturning people’s rights to life, liberty and pursuit of

happiness fundamentally.



**[KEY WORD]**

Armed Attack Situation and
Anticipated Armed Attack Situation

-  An armed attack situation means a situation where an armed attack

against Japan from outside has occurred or an imminent and clear

danger of the armed attack against Japan is acknowledged.

-  An anticipated armed attack situation means a situation where

an armed attack has yet to occur, but circumstances are growing
increasingly strained and an armed attack is anticipated.

(These situations are referred to as “Armed Attack Situation, etc.”

collectively.)


In addition to the ones explained in this section, see Reference 18 for the other conditions in which infl icting injury on a person is permitted.

Following the addition of a Survival-Threatening Situation, the title of the Act was revised from the “Act on the Peace and Independence of Japan and Maintenance of the Nation and the People’s
Security in Armed Attack Situations, etc.” to the “Act on the Peace and Independence of Japan and Maintenance of the Nation and the People’s Security in Armed Attack Situations, etc., and a Survival

b. Maritime Transportation Restriction Act[4]

The previous Maritime Transportation Restriction Act
had provided procedures for stopped ship inspections and
taking ship measures conducted by the MSDF to control
maritime transportation of weapons, ammunition and
military personnel, etc., to armed forces, etc., of foreign
countries making armed attacks against Japan in Armed
Attack Situations. The revision Act added the provisions
to control maritime transportation in Survival-Threatening
Situations. Furthermore, the waters in which the MSDF
can take these measures. According to the revised law
the MSDF can control maritime transportation in Japan’s
territorial waters, territorial waters of foreign countries
(only when their consent is obtained) and the high seas,
although it was previously restricted to Japan’s territorial
waters and the high seas surrounding Japan.
c. Prisoners of War Act[5]

The Prisoners of War Act previously specifi ed items
necessary for the detention, internment and other forms
of treatment of prisoners of war, etc., in Armed Attack
Situations in order to ensure the appropriate practice
of the International Humanitarian Law regarding the
treatment of prisoners of war, etc. The provisions were
added for the application of the Prisoners of War Act in
Survival-Threatening Situations as well.
d. Act Regarding the Use of Specifi c Public Facilities[6]

To ensure the appropriate and rapid operations of the
SDF and the U.S. Forces and measures vital to the
protection of the people, the Act Regarding the Use of
Specifi c Public Facilities provides for procedures to
be taken for comprehensive coordination of the use of
specifi c public facilities (ports, airports, roads, waters, air
zones and radio waves) in Armed Attack Situations, etc.
The operations of the armed forces of foreign countries
other than the U.S. Forces in Armed Attack Situations,
etc., were added to the scope of coordination of the use of
specifi c public facilities.



Emergency Situations other than Armed Attack

Situations, etc., and Survival-Threatening Situations


The Act on the Peace and Independence of Japan and
Maintenance of the Nation and the People’s Security in
Armed Attack Situations, etc., and Survival-Threatening
Situations provides for appropriate and rapid response
measures to be implemented in emergency situations
other than an Armed Attack Situation and SurvivalThreatening Situations in order for the Government to
ensure the peace and independence of the country, and
to maintain the security of the country and its people.[7]


3 Responses of the SDF


**(1) Positioning as the Mission of the SDF**
The primary duty of the SDF had been to “defend Japan
against direct or indirect aggression.” Now since the purpose
of the SDF’s operation in Survival-Threatening Situations
stemming from an armed attack on a foreign country is also
to defend japan as well, the revised legislation stipulates
this is one of the SDF’s primary duties.

**(2) Defense Operation**
Although an Armed Attack Situation, had been the only
situation in which a Defense Operation order may be
issued, the revised legislation newly added SurvivalThreatening Situations to this category. Following this
revision, the Prime Minister can now issue a Defense
Operation order to the whole or part of the SDF when it
is deemed necessary for the defense of Japan in Armed
Attack Situations and Survival-Threatening Situations. As
it had been before the law revision, prior Diet approval is
required for a Defense Operation order in principle. The
SDF under Defense Operation duty is allowed to exercise
the use of force only when the “New Three Conditions”
are satisfi ed.[8]


**(3) Others**
Among the provisions setting forth a variety of authorities
and special measures, etc., necessary for SDF operations


Following the addition of Survival-Threatening Situations, the title of the Act was revised from “Law Concerning the Restrictions of Maritime Transportation of Foreign Military Supplies, and Others in Armed
Attack Situations, etc.” to “Law Concerning the Restrictions of Maritime Transportation of Foreign Military Supplies, and Others in Armed Attack Situations, etc., and Survival-Threatening Situations.”

Following the addition of Survival-Threatening Situations, the title of the Act was revised from “Law Concerning the Treatment of Prisoners of War and Other Detainees in Armed Attack Situations, etc.”
to “Law Concerning the Treatment of Prisoners of War and Other Detainees in Armed Attack Situations, etc., and Survival-Threatening Situations.”

The offi cial title of the Act is the “Law Concerning the Use of Specifi c Public Facilities and Others in Armed Attack Situations, etc.”

A contingency situation other than an Armed Attack Situation and a situation where an armed attack against a foreign country resulting in a threat to Japan’s survival that may have a signifi cant impact
on the security of the nation and its people, including an emergency response situation (a situation where actions that may kill or injure many people by using methods equivalent to those used in an
armed attack, or a situation where it is recognized that the relevant actions represent a clear and present threat that necessitate an emergency response by the state).

In general, the “use of force” in Paragraph 1, Article 9 of the Constitution means the act of combat by Japanese physical and personnel organizations as part of an international armed confl ict. In
contrast to this, the “use of weapons” as referred to in the Self-Defense Forces Act, etc., means the use of equipment and machinery, etc., designed to directly kill or harm people, or to destroy things
as a means of armed fi ghting, in accordance with their original usages. While the “use of force” in Paragraph 1, Article 9 of the Constitution is the idea related to resorting to force, including the “use
of weapons,” all types of the “use of weapons” do not necessarily fall under the category of the “use of force” prohibited under Article 9 of the Constitution. The “use of force” is permitted under the

If the Minister of Defense fi nds it unavoidable
after receiving a request from prefectural governors,[11]
or receives a request from the Task Force Chief, upon
approval by the Prime Minister, the Minister of Defense
can issue civil Protection Dispatch Order to the SDF units,
etc. to civil protection dispatch to conduct civil protection
measures or emergency response protection measures
(including assisting the evacuation of residents, providing
relief to the evacuees and immediate restoration).

Part III, Chapter 1, Section 2-11 (Initiatives for Civil Protection)

**(2) Relationship between Survival-Threatening**
**Situations and Civil Protection Measures**

The Civil Protection Act, stipulates necessary measures,
including issuance of warnings and measures for the
evacuation and relief of residents from the perspective of
protection of the people and their livelihood from a direct
attack against Japan and physical damage. A situation in
which the rules of Survival Threatening Situations are
applicable and warning issuance and evacuation and relief
of residents are required is nothing less than a situation
where an armed attack against Japan is anticipated or
imminent. In such a case, it is recognized as Armed
Attack Situations, etc., and necessary measures are to be
implemented under the Civil Protection Act.[12]

2 Responses to Situations that will Have an Important Infl uence


Previously, the Law Concerning Measures to Ensure
the Peace and Security of Japan in Situations in Areas
Surrounding Japan had stipulated rear area support,[13] rear
area search and rescue operations[14] and ship inspection
operations (those set forth in the Ship Inspection
Operations Law) conducted by Japan as measures to
respond to situations that will have an important infl uence
on Japan’s peace and security in areas surrounding Japan.
In accordance with the changes in the security
environment surrounding Japan, the law revision deleted
“in areas surrounding Japan” from “situations that will
have an important infl uence on Japan’s peace and security
in areas surrounding Japan” and changed the name of
situations from “situations in areas surrounding Japan” to
“situations that will have an important infl uence,”[15] and also
extended the scope of militaries that the SDF can support
and add new types of response measures as follows.


and security as (1) logistics support activities, (2) search
and rescue activities, (3) ship inspection operations, and
(4) other measures necessary to respond to situations that
will have an important infl uence on Japan’s peace and
security, and added “lodging, storage, use of facilities
and training services” as the types of goods and services
provided by the SDF in (1) logistics support activities, on
top of the “supply, transportation, repair and maintenance,
medical activities, communications, airport and seaport
services, and base services” previously. While the
provision of weapons is not included, as before, the
revised law allows the “provision of ammunition” and
“refueling and maintenance of aircraft ready to take off
for combat operations.”
The revised law made it possible to implement
response measures in foreign territories, but only when
the foreign country concerned consents.


1 Militaries that the SDF supports


3 Measures to Avoid Integration with the Use of Force


On top of the existing “U.S. Armed Forces engaged
in activities contributing to the achievement of the
objectives of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty,” the revised
law added “armed forces of other foreign countries
engaged in activities contributing to the achievement
of the objectives of the UN Charter” and “other similar
organizations” on the armed forces, etc., responding to
situations that will have an important infl uence on Japan’s
peace and security, which the SDF is allowed to support.


The revised law sets forth the following measures in order
to avoid integration with the use of force by a foreign
country and also to ensure the safety of SDF personnel:

-  The SDF does not conduct activities in “the scene
where a combat is actually taking place.” Regarding
search and rescue operations, however, when stranded
personnel have been located and rescue operations have
commenced, the SDF units are allowed to continue
search and rescue activities as long as the safety of
these units is ensured.

-  The commanding offi cers, etc., of the SDF units order
the temporary suspension of activities, etc., if combat
operations occur or are expected to occur at the site of
their activities or in the vicinity.

-  The Minister of Defense designates the area for
implementing activities, and if it is deemed diffi cult to
implement operations smoothly and safely in the whole
or part of that area, the Minister must promptly change
the designation of the area or order the cessation of the
activities being implemented there.

13 Rear area support under the Law Concerning Measures to Ensure the Peace and Security of Japan in Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan means support measures, including the provision of goods,
services, and conveniences, given by Japan in rear areas to the U.S. Forces conducting activities that contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty in situations in
areas surrounding Japan.

14 Rear area search and rescue operations under the Law Concerning Measures to Ensure the Peace and Security of Japan in Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan mean operations conducted by the
SDF in situations in areas surrounding Japan to search and rescue those who were engaged in combat and were stranded in rear areas (including transportation of those rescued).

15 Previously, “situations in areas surrounding Japan” was understood to be an idea that focuses on the nature of situations, not a geographical idea. In light of the changes in the security environment in
recent years, however, the defi nition was revised since it is not appropriate to use an expression that could be interpreted as geographically limiting areas where situations that will have an important
infl uence on Japan’s peace and security may arise. In association with this, the title of the Law was amended from the “Law Concerning Measures to Ensure the Peace and Security of Japan in

allowed in emergency.

5 Authority for the Use of Weapons


When engaged in logistics support activities or search
and rescue activities in the event of a situation that will
have an important infl uence on Japan, SDF personnel are
permitted to use weapons if necessary in order to protect
oneself or other SDF members who are at the same scene,
or those under the supervision of oneself (so-called “the
use of weapons of self-preservation type”). In addition,
SDF personnel are permitted to use weapons jointly with
members of the armed forces or other organizations of
foreign countries in order to protect the lives and bodies
of those stationed at the camps (however, infl icting injury


6 Ship Inspection Operations[16]


**(1) Outline**
Ship inspection operations mean operations to inspect

warships and others) and to request, if necessary, a
change of sea route, or destination port or place, for the
purpose of strictly enforcing the regulatory measures
concerning trade or other economic activities to which
Japan is a party, conducted based on the UN Security
Council resolutions or with the consent of the fl ag state.[17]

**(2) Authority for the Use of Weapons**
The so-called “the use of weapons of self-preservation
type” is permitted.


3 Maintenance of Public Order and Responses to Aggression that Do Not Amount to an Armed Attack


**(3) Authority for the Use of Weapons**
Article 7 of the Police Duties Execution Act applies
_mutatis mutandis to the execution of duties of SDF_
personnel, permitting SDF personnel the use of weapons.[18]
Moreover, SDF personnel are permitted to use weapons
to the extent judged to be reasonable depending on the
situation when certain conditions are met.[19, 20]

[See] Part III, Chapter 1, Section 2-4 (Response to Attacks by

Guerillas, Special Operations Forces and Others)

2 Maritime Security Operations


**(1) Outline**
When there is a special need to protect lives or property
or maintain public security at sea, the Minister of Defense
can order SDF units to take necessary actions at sea upon
approval by the Prime Minister.


1 Public Security Operations


**(1) Public Security Operations by Order**
In the event of an indirect aggression or another emergency
situation, the Prime Minister can order the whole or
part of the SDF to deploy if it is deemed impossible to
maintain public security with the general police force. In
principle, the Prime Minister must bring the order to the
Diet for deliberation, and request for its approval within
twenty days from the day the order has been given.

**(2) Public Security Operations by Request**
Upon consulting with the Public Safety Commission of
the prefecture concerned, the governor of that prefecture
can request the Prime Minister to dispatch units, etc., of
the SDF if it is deemed unavoidable as the situation will
have a serious infl uence on public security. Following
such a request, the Prime Minister can order the SDF to
mobilize when a situation calls for such action.


**(2) Authority for the Use of Weapons**
The provisions of Article 7 of the Police Duties
Execution Act apply mutatis mutandis to the execution


16 Inspection of ships in the case of a situation that will have an important infl uence on Japan’s Peace and Security is conducted based on the “Law Concerning Ship Inspection Operations in Situations
that Will Have an Important Infl uence on Japan’s Peace and Security and Other Situations (Ship Inspection Operations Act).” See Article 5 of this section (Framework for Contributing to the Peace and
Stability of the International Community) for ship inspection operations in situations threatening the international peace and security that the international community is collectively addressing.

18 Article 7 of the Police Duties Execution Act (Use of Weapons) permits the use of weapons if deemed reasonably necessary in accordance with the situation. However, causing harm to people is
permitted only in cases of legitimate self-defense or evasion of clear and present danger.

19 The “certain conditions” defi ned herein apply to cases such as when SDF personnel reasonably consider that persons to be guarded in the line of duty and others may suffer violence or infringement,
or are apparently exposed to such danger and no appropriate means of overcoming it other than the use of weapons exist.

Commentary Acceleration of Procedures to Issue Orders for Public Security **COLUMN**

Operations and Maritime Security Operation

Considering the increasingly severe security environment surrounding Japan, situations that are neither pure peacetime nor
contingencies (the so-called gray zone situations) are liable to occur, posing risks which could develop into more serious situations.
In order to respond promptly to such situations of infringement that do not amount to an armed attack, and ensure seamless and
suffi cient responses to any unlawful acts, the Government made cabinet decisions regarding the acceleration of procedures to issue
orders for public security operations and maritime security operations, etc., in May 2015, particularly in the following three cases:

-  Responses to foreign naval vessels making maritime navigation through the territorial sea or the internal
**waters of Japan that does not fall under the category of innocent passage under international law**

-  Responses to the unlawful landing on a remote island or its surrounding seas by an armed group

-  Responses to acts of infringement when SDF ships or aircraft detect foreign ships committing said acts
**against Japanese private ships on the high seas**

Specifi cally, when an urgent decision is necessary concerning the issuance of orders for public security operations, etc., but it
is diffi cult to promptly convene an extraordinary cabinet meeting, the Prime Minister can preside over a cabinet meeting to make the
decision by obtaining the consent of the Ministers of State by telephone and other means. Any Minister of State who could not be
contacted in advance shall be notifi ed of the cabinet decision ex post facto.

weapons. In addition, partial application of the Japan
Coast Guard Law allows SDF personnel to exercise
authority such as requesting nearby persons or ships to
cooperate or boarding on other ships for inspection. The
use of weapons is also permitted in order to stop a ship
when certain conditions are met.

3 Counter-Piracy Operations


**(1) Outline**
When there is a special need to respond to acts of piracy,
the Minister of Defense may order SDF units to conduct


operations at sea against such acts upon approval by the
Prime Minister. In order to obtain approval, the Minister
of Defense shall create a response guideline and submit it
to the Prime Minister.

**(2) Authority for the Use of Weapons**
SDF personnel may use weapons in executing duties under
Article 7 of the Police Duties Execution Act. When there
are reasonable grounds to believe that no other means
are available to stop the passage of a ship perpetrating
acts of piracy,[21] including approaching excessively close
to a non-military ship, the use of weapons is permitted
to the extent that is considered reasonably necessary in
accordance with the situation.

may create an emergency response guideline and get
approval by the Prime Minister in peacetime. Based
on this emergency response guideline, the Minister
of Defense can order the SDF units to take measures
to destroy ballistic missiles or other objects in the
airspace over Japan’s territory or high seas in advance
for a certain period of time once they have actually
been launched towards Japan.

Objects), Part III, Chapter 1, Section 2-3 (Response to Ballistic
Missile Attacks, etc.)


4 Destruction Measures Against Ballistic Missiles


In case ballistic missiles[22] or other objects launched at
Japan as an armed attack against Japan or a SurvivalThreatening Situation, and the New Three Conditions
are simultaneously met, the SDF would cope with the
situation by a Defense Operation order. On the other
hand, if ballistic missiles are fl ying towards Japan, but
the situation cannot be acknowledged as an armed attack,
the Minister of Defense can take the following measures:
(1) When it is anticipated that ballistic missiles or other
objects are fl ying towards Japan and it is deemed
necessary to take measures to protect lives and
properties in Japan’s territory if they fall to the ground,
upon approval by the Prime Minister, the Minister of
Defense may order the SDF units to take measures to
destroy the ballistic missiles in airspace over Japan’s
territory or high seas once they have actually been
launched towards Japan.
(2) Also, besides the case of (1), the Minister of Defense
may not have enough time to get approval by the Prime
Minister when the situation unfolds rapidly such as the
cases when there was no warning prior to the launch.
In preparation for such case, the Minister of Defense


5 Measures Against Intrusion of Territorial Airspace

The Minister of Defense may order SDF units to take
necessary measures to make intruding aircraft land or
withdraw from the territorial airspace of Japan (guiding
intruders away, issuing radio transmission warnings,
use of weapons,[23] etc.) when a foreign aircraft intrudes
Japan’s territorial airspace in violation of international
law, the provisions of the Aviation Law or other relevant
laws and regulations.

Concept of ensuring civilian control of the military

❍ Response against ballistic missiles requires the government to assess the possibility of missiles fl ying toward Japan by comprehensively analyzing and evaluating the specifi c
situation and international circumstances. In addition to the SDF destroying the missile, interagency actions are required, for example, measures for civil protection such as alert and
evacuation, diplomatic activities, information gathering by related agencies, and enhancement of readiness for emergencies.
❍ In view of the importance of the matter and the necessity of action by the Japanese government as a whole, the Cabinet and Minister of Defense can suffi ciently fulfi ll their
responsibilities upon the Prime Minister’s approval (Cabinet decision) and orders by the Minister of Defense. Furthermore, the supervision of the Diet is also defi ned with a provision
in the law stipulating reporting to the Diet.

Overseas

Previously, operations to protect Japanese nationals,
etc. overseas in emergency situations were limited to
transporting to safe places those who need protection of
their lives or bodies, and rescue of Japanese nationals,
etc. overseas involving the use of weapons was not
allowed even in cases of terrorist attacks. In light of
these circumstances, the newly established provisions
enable the units of the SDF to take “rescue” that go
beyond transportation and include guarding and rescue
of Japanese nationals, etc. overseas whose lives or bodies
could be harmed in emergency situations when the
following requirements are satisfi ed:

The newly added provisions, Article 95-2 of the SDF
Law, enable SDF personnel to protect the weapons and
other equipment of the units of the United States Forces
and the armed forces of other foreign countries that are
in cooperation with the SDF and are currently engaged
in activities that contribute to the defense of Japan. In
December 2016, the National Security Council approved
“The Implementation Guidelines for Article 95-2 of
the Self-Defense Forces Law,” which sets out the basic
principles of the article and the Cabinet’s involvement in
the operationalization of the article, etc.

**(1) Coverage**
Weapons, etc. of the units of the United States Forces,
armed forces of other foreign countries and other similar
organizations, that are, in cooperation with the SDF and
are, currently engaged in activities that contribute to the
defense of Japan (including joint exercises but excluding
activities in the scene where the combat activities are
actually being conducted).


**(1) Procedures**
Upon a request from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and
after subsequent consultations between the Minister for
Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Defense, the Minister
of Defense issues an order following approval by the
Prime Minister.

**(2) Requirements for Implementation**
When all of the following conditions are satisfi ed, the
rescue measures may be implemented:
a. It needs to be confi rmed that in the areas where the
rescue measures are taken, the competent authorities
of the country concerned are maintaining public
safety and order at the time, and no act of combat
will be conducted;
b. The country concerned[24] consents to the SDF taking the
rescue measures (including the use of weapons); and
c. It is expected that coordination and cooperation can
be ensured between the units of the SDF and the
competent authority of the country concerned in order
to carry out the rescue measures as smoothly and
safely as possible in response to anticipated dangers.


**(2) Procedures, etc.**
When a request is made by the United States Forces,
etc., and only when the Minister of Defense deems it
necessary, SDF personnel provide asset protection.

**(3) Authority for the Use of Weapons**
In protecting weapons and other equipment described
in (1) above as part of their duties, SDF personnel
are permitted to use weapons to the extent judged to
be reasonably necessary depending on the situation
when there are adequate grounds to recognize the
need to use weapons to protect persons, weapons, and
other equipment (however, causing harm to people is
permitted only in cases of legitimate self-protection or
evasion from present danger).


**(3) Authority for the Use of Weapons**
In carrying out their duties to implement the rescue
measures, SDF personnel are permitted to use weapons to
the extent judged to be reasonably necessary, depending on
the situation when there are adequate grounds to recognize
the compelling need to use weapons to protect the lives
and bodies of Japanese nationals and others or themselves,
or to eliminate actions that obstruct their duties (including

a. The scope extended to the United States Armed Forces
that are on fi eld sites along with the units of the SDF
carrying out the following actions or activities and
engaged in activities similar to those of the SDF units:

4 Disaster Relief Dispatches and Others


2 Earthquake Prevention Dispatch and Nuclear
Disaster Relief Dispatch

When a warning declaration is issued based on the Act
on Special Measures Concerning Countermeasures for
Large-Scale Earthquakes[27] or a declaration of a nuclear
emergency situation is issued based on the Act on Special
Measures Concerning Nuclear Emergency Preparedness,
the Minister of Defense is authorized to order dispatching
units upon a request of the Director of the Seismic
Disaster Warning Headquarters or the Director of the
Nuclear Disaster Countermeasures Headquarters (the
Prime Minister).

[See] Fig. II-3-2-6 (Flow of Events from the Point of Request to

Dispatch and Withdrawal)
Part III, Chapter 1, Section 2-8 (Response to Large-Scale
Disasters)


1 Disaster Relief Dispatches


In principle, Disaster Relief Dispatch is conducted as
follows: prefectural governors or other offi cials ask the
Minister of Defense, or an offi cer designated by the
Minister, to dispatch the SDF units, etc., in the event of a
natural disaster; the Minister or the designated offi cer will
dispatch the units if it is deemed necessary for the SDF to
respond to the disaster.[26] This procedure is based on the
idea that prefectural governors and other offi cials should
grasp the overall conditions of the disaster and their own
disaster relief capabilities fi rst, and then decide whether
to make a request for the SDF disaster relief dispatch.


26 The Commandant of the Japan Coast Guard, the Director General of the Regional Coast Guard Headquarters, and the Director of the Airport Administrative Offi ce may request a disaster relief dispatch.
With regard to disaster relief dispatch, earthquake prevention dispatch, and nuclear disaster relief dispatch, (1) SDF personnel ordered for the dispatch may take measures (Article 4 of the Police
Duties Execution Law) such as evacuation based on Article 94 of the SDF Law (Authority in Disaster Relief Dispatch, etc.); (2) SDF Reserve Personnel and SDF Ready Reserve Personnel may be
called up for service in the event of disaster relief dispatch, and SDF Ready Personnel in the event of earthquake prevention dispatch or nuclear disaster relief dispatch; and (3) special units may be
temporarily formed as necessary

5 Framework for Contributing to the Peace and Stability of the International Community


than developing new legislation in response to every
emergence of a specifi c need in the future, the International
Peace Support Law, enacted as general law, enables
Japan to conduct support operations more expeditiously
and effectively for the military forces of foreign countries
operating for international peace and security, making it
possible to proactively contribute to international peace
and security on Japan’s own initiative.


is Collectively Addressing

1 Peace and Security that the International Community


The International Peace Support Act was newly enacted
in the recent legal revision in order to ensure peace and
security of the international community, enabling Japan to
conduct cooperation and support operations for the armed
forces of foreign countries engaged in operations for
international peace and security in situations threatening
the international peace and security that the international
community is collectively addressing. Previously, the
Japanese Government has enacted special measures laws,
such as the Act on Special Measures against terrorism /
Replenishment Support Special Measures Law,[28] and the
Law Concerning Special Measures on Humanitarian and
Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq,[29] in order to conduct
operations such as at-sea replenishment activities in
the Indian Ocean, and humanitarian and reconstruction
support activities in Iraq. However, from the perspective
of enabling seamless responses to any situation, rather



**[KEY WORD]**

Situations Threatening the International Peace
and Security that the International Community
is Collectively Addressing

These refer to situations that threaten peace and security of
the international community, and the international community
is collectively addressing the situations in accordance with the
objectives of the UN Charter to remove the threat; Japan, as a
member of the international community, needs to independently and
proactively contribute to these activities


28 The offi cial title of the former Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Act is the “Special Measures Law Concerning Measures Taken by Japan in Support of the Activities of Foreign Countries Aiming to
Achieve the Purposes of the Charter of the United Nations in Response to the Terrorist Attacks Which Took Place on 11 September 2001 in the United States of America as well as Concerning
Humanitarian Measures Based on Relevant Resolutions of the United Nations,” and the offi cial title of the Replenishment Support Special Measures Act is the “Special Measures law Concerning
Implementation of Replenishment Support Activities towards the Anti-Terrorism Maritime Interdiction Operation.”


-----

**(1) Requirements**
The requirement for Japan to offer cooperation and
support to the operations of foreign armed forces is the
issuance of one of the following UN resolutions (by the
General Assembly or the Security Council).
a. Resolutions that decide, call upon, recommend or
authorize the country, which is subject to Japan’s
support operations to respond to situations that threaten
the peace and security of the international community
b. Other than (a), resolutions that regard the situations as
a threat to peace or a breach of peace and call on UN
member states to respond to the situations concerned

**(2) Response Measures**
The following response measures can be implemented in
situations threatening the international peace and security
that the international community is collectively addressing.
a. Cooperation and support activities
Supplies and services to armed forces of foreign countries
(supply, transportation, repair and maintenance, medical
services, communications, airport and seaport services,
base services, lodging, storage, use of facilities, training
services and construction) are to be provided.
While the provision of weapons is not included as
in the Law Concerning Measures to Ensure the Peace
and Security of Japan in Situations that Will Have an
Important Infl uence on Japan’s Peace and Security, the
revised law now allows the “provision of ammunition”
and “refueling and maintenance of aircraft ready to take
off for combat operations.”
b. Search and rescue activities
c. Ship inspection operations (those set forth in the Ship
Inspection Operations Law)
Ship inspection operations were only permitted to be
performed in situations in areas surrounding Japan.[30]
However, in light of the increased cases of maritime
inspection as countermeasures against global threat
such as the transnational transfer of weapons of mass
destruction and weapons for international terrorism
organizations in the international community since 2000,
which is when the Ship Inspection Operations Act was
enacted, the SDF can carry out ship inspection operations
in situations threatening the international peace and
security that the international community is collectively
addressing as defi ned in the International Peace Act.


**(3) Measures to Avoid Integration with the Use of Force**
The following measures are set forth in order to avoid
integration with the use of force by a foreign country and
also to ensure the safety of SDF personnel:

-  Japan does not implement support activities in
the scene where a combat is actually taking place.
However, when the personnel having been stranded
have already been found and rescue operations have
commenced, the SDF units are allowed to continue
search and rescue activities concerning them as long
as the safety of these units is ensured.

-  The commanding offi cers of the SDF units, etc., order
a temporary suspension of support activities if combat
operations occur or are expected to occur at the site of
their activities or in the vicinity.

-  The Minister of Defense designates the area for
implementing activities, and if it is deemed diffi cult
to implement operations smoothly and safely in the
whole or part of that area, must promptly change the
designation of the area or order the cessation of the
activities being implemented there.

**(4) Diet Approval**
Prior Diet approval required without exception, and
each house of the Diet has an obligation to make efforts
towards decisions within 7 days (excluding any period
when the Diet is in recess). In addition, re-approval is
required in the case of a lapse of more than two years
since the commencement of the response measures.


**(5) Authority for the Use of Weapons**
SDF personnel engaged in cooperation support activities
or search and rescue activities in a situation threatening
the international peace and security that the international
community is collectively addressing are permitted the
so-called “right to use weapons of self-preservation
type.” In addition, SDF personnel are permitted to use
weapons with members of the armed forces and other
organizations of foreign countries in order to protect the
lives and bodies of those stationed in the camps.

2 International Peace Cooperation Activities


The International Peace Cooperation Act, enacted in 1992,
set forth a framework to operate appropriately and quickly
in the following three operation categories namely UN
PKOs, International Humanitarian Relief Operations, and
International Election Observation Operations, and urged


30 At the time when the Ship Inspection Operations Law was enacted, the conduct of ship inspection operations in situations other than situations in areas surrounding Japan was positioned as a separate


-----

the Japanese government to take measures to provide
contributions in kind for those operations, thereby enabling
Japan to actively contribute to international peace efforts
centering upon the UN. The law also stipulates a set of
basic guidelines, or the so-called “Five Principles for PKO
Participation” for Japan’s participation in these activities.
At the time of the enactment of the Act, it was
assumed that Japan was to cooperate with the ceasefi re
monitoring in conventional confl icts between states
within the framework of UN PKOs under the control
of the UN. However, the nature of confl icts that the
international community faces has transformed into
intra-state confl icts or a combination of inter-state and
intra-state confl icts. Therefore, support for the nation
building of state parties to confl ict and the creation
of a safe environment necessary to achieve this end
have become important tasks in international peace
cooperation activities. Furthermore, there is a wide range
of international peace cooperation activities that have
come to be implemented outside of the UN frameworks.[31]

Given the diversifi cation and qualitative change of
the international peace cooperation activities, through
the recent legal revision, Japan, in order to contribute
further to peace and stability of international community
under the policy of “Proactive Contribution to Peace”
based on the principle of international cooperation, has
expanded the scope of tasks that can be implemented in
UN PKOs and reviewed the authority to use weapons,
and also introduced new provisions to allow for active
participation in humanitarian and reconstruction
assistance, safety-ensuring, and other non-UN-led
operations (“Internationally Coordinated Operations for
Peace and Security”).

**(1) Requirements for Participation**
a. UN Peace Keeping Operations
While maintaining the framework of the Five Principles
for Participation, the new law stipulates that the consent
of acceptance of countries to which the areas where
these operations are conducted belong needs to be stably
maintained throughout the period of the operations if the
SDF conducts so-called “safety-ensuring” operations or
so-called “kaketsuke-keigo” operations.
b. Internationally Coordinated Operations for Peace and
Security
Besides the existing three types of operations (UN PKOs,
International Humanitarian Relief Operations, and
International Election Observation Operations), Japan


is now able to participate in Internationally Coordinated
Operations for Peace and Security, when any of the
following conditions is satisfi ed, in addition to the
fulfi llment of the Five Principles for Participation.
1. Based on resolutions of the General Assembly, the Security
Council, or the Economic and Social Council of the UN
2. At the requests of any of the following international
organizations:

-  The UN

-  Organs established by the UN General Assembly
or Specialized Agencies, Funds and Programmes
of the UN such as the Offi ce of the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees or otherwise specifi ed
by a Cabinet Order

-  Regional organizations, as prescribed in Article
52 of the UN Charter or organs established by
multilateral treaties, acknowledged as having the
actual achievements or expertise pertaining to the
activities of Internationally Coordinated Operations
for Peace and Security such as the European Union
or otherwise specifi ed by a Cabinet Order
3. At the requests of the countries to which the areas
where those operations are to be conducted belong
(limited to only those cases that are supported by any
of the principal organs of the UN as prescribed in
Article 7 (1) of the UN Charter).



**[KEY WORD]**

So-called “Five Principles for Participation”
in PKO

(1) Agreements on a ceasefi re shall have been reached among the Parties
to Armed Confl ict; (2) Consent for the conduct of UN Peacekeeping
Operations as well as Japan’s participation in such operations shall
have been obtained from the countries to which the areas where those
operations are to be conducted belongs as well as from the Parties to
Armed Confl ict; (3) The operations shall strictly maintain impartiality, and
not favor any of the parties to the armed confl ict; (4) Should any of the
requirements in the above-mentioned guideline cease to be satisfi ed, the
International Peace Cooperation Corps may terminate the International
Peace Cooperation Assignments; and (5) The use of weapons shall
be limited to the minimum necessity for the protection of the lives of
personnel dispatched, in principle. Following the latest amendment
of the Act, additional condition, “when the consent for acceptance is
deemed to be consistently maintained, the use of weapons in defense of
the mission mandate is allowed for implementation of so-called ’safetyensuring’ operations and the so-called ‘kaketsuke-keigo’ (coming to
protection of individuals related to operations in response to urgent
request) operations as the use of weapons beyond self-preservation and
Article 95 of the SDF Law (the use of force for protection of weapons,
etc.)” has been added to (5) of the Five Principles for Participation.


31 These activities include the Aceh Monitoring Mission (AMM), implemented at the request of the European Union, and the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), implemented at the


-----

**(2) Description of Tasks**
In addition to ceasefi re monitoring and humanitarian
relief operations for affl icted persons, the following tasks
have been added and expanded to tasks in UN PKOs, etc.

-  Addition of monitoring, stationing, patrol, inspections
at checkpoints and security escort for the protection
of safety of specifi ed areas including prevention and
suppression of injury or harm against lives, bodies
and property of local population, affl icted persons
and other populations requiring protection (so-called
“safety-ensuring” operations)

-  Addition of protection of lives and bodies of individuals
engaging in international peace cooperation operations
or providing support for those operations, in response
to urgent requests when unexpected dangers to lives
or bodies of such individuals related to operations
occur or are imminent (so-called “kaketsuke-keigo”
operations)

-  Expansion of tasks such as provision of advice or
guidance related to works for the purpose of assisting
in establishing or re-establishing organizations of
the Government relating to national defense or other
organizations

-  Expansion of tasks conducted at organizations for
supervision and coordination of tasks to include
planning, drafting, coordination or collection and
updating of information in Headquarters Offi ce
or coordination offi ces conducting UN PKOs and
Internationally Coordinated Operations for Peace and
Security, for the implementation of tasks (of mission
headquarters’ operations)

**(3) Authority to Use Weapons**
a. Expansion of the Authority to Use Weapons for Selfpreservation (Joint Protection of Camps)
Camps of UN peacekeeping operations (PKOs), etc., are
the bases where personnel of participating countries spend
their time when not conducting operations outside camps,
and the last bastion, so to speak, to secure the safety of lives
and bodies of those inside. Thus, in the case of unexpected
situations, such as attacks against camps, it is essential for
SDF personnel stationed in the camps, even if they are
not the direct target of such attacks, to coordinate with the
personnel of other countries and protect each other and
deal with the common danger. In light of this, the use of
weapons for the purpose of protecting individuals jointly


stationed in the camps are allowed as the use of weapons
for self-preservation according to the revised legislation.[32]

b. The Authority to Use Weapons in the So-Called
“Kaketsuke-Keigo” Operations
In carrying out so-called “kaketsuke-keigo” operations,
uniformed SDF personnel are permitted to use weapons
to the extent judged reasonably necessary according to
the circumstances, when reasonable grounds are found
for the unavoidable necessity to protect the lives or
bodies of themselves or individuals related to operations
that they intend to protect (however, infl icting injury on
a person is permitted only in the cases of legitimate selfdefense or aversion of clear and present danger).
c. The Authority to Use Weapons for So-Called “SafetyEnsuring” Operations
In carrying out so-called “safety-ensuring” operations,
uniformed SDF personnel are permitted to use weapons
within the limits judged reasonably necessary according
to the circumstances, when reasonable grounds are found
for the unavoidable necessity to protect the lives, bodies or
properties of themselves or other individuals, or to eliminate
obstructive behavior for their duties (however, infl icting
injury on a person is permitted only in the cases of legitimate
self-defense or aversion of clear and present danger).

**(4) Diet Approval**
Diet approval is necessary prior to the commencement
of so-called “safety-ensuring” operations, in addition to
ceasefi re monitoring, in principle (ex-post facto approval
is permitted when the Diet is in recess or the House of
Representatives is dissolved).


**(5) Ensuring the Safety of SDF Personnel**
The provision for ensuring the safety of the personnel of
the International Peace Cooperation Corps was added,
while the measures for ensuring the safety of the personnel
were incorporated into the matters to be stipulated in the
Implementation Procedures.

**(6) Other Key Points of Amendment**

-  Dispatch of uniformed SDF personnel to the UN
(dispatch of Force Commanders of UN PKOs)
The Act was amended to make it possible to dispatch
uniformed SDF personnel and have them engage
in the tasks of the UN and those concerning overall
management of tasks implemented by units of the

with the consent of the Prime Minister.[33]

-  Provision of supplies and services to the Armed Forces
of the United States, etc., for their operations to cope
with large-scale disaster[34]

The Act was amended to make it possible for the SDF
to provide the U.S. Forces or the Australian Defence
Force with supplies or services when they request the
provision and are located in the area together with the
units of the SDF, etc., and is undertaking operations to
cope with large-scale disasters, so far as it does not hinder
the performance of International Peace Cooperation
Assignments, etc., of the SDF.[35]


3 International Disaster Relief Operations


When large-scale disasters occur in regions overseas,
especially in less-developed regions, and the governments
of the affected countries or international organizations
request assistance, the Minister of Foreign Affairs shall
consult with the chief of relevant administrative agencies
including the Ministry of Defense as well as the National
Public Safety Commission regarding the details of such
request if dispatch is deemed appropriate.
Following such consultation, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs may consult with the Minister of Defense to ask for
cooperation with regard to operations of SDF units if there
is a special need.
The Minister of Defense can order units of the
SDF to carry out rescue and medical activities as well as
transportation of personnel and supplies based on the
consultation above.[36]


6 Other Amendments in the Development of the Legislation for Peace and Security


for deliberation, and items for deliberation regarding
“situations in areas surrounding Japan” were changed to
items for deliberation regarding “situations that will have

Commentary Risk of Being Dragged into a War **COLUMN**

The “use of force” permitted as a measure for self-defense under Article 9 of the Constitution of Japan must meet the very strict
requirements of the Three New Conditions. They are extremely stringent requirements not seen anywhere else in the world and serve
as a clear constitutional restraint. Furthermore, when the Minister of Defense issues a defense operation order to actually conduct
the “use of force,” the Government must seek Diet approval in advance, in principle. As such, since the SDF conducts its activities in
compliance with the Constitution and laws enacted by the Diet, it will never be the case that the “use of force” by the SDF expands
endlessly, resulting in Japan being dragged against its intention into a war of another country.
In addition, under the Legislation for Peace and Security, the Japan-U.S. Alliance will function more for Japan’s peace and
security. By sending this message out to the world, Japan’s capability to prevent a confl ict from occurring, in other words its
deterrence capability, will be further enhanced, and the risk of Japan coming under an attack will be further reduced. Furthermore, it
will enable Japan to cooperate further with the international community for the maintenance of peace and development of the region
and the world, making the world more peaceful.

33 The dispatch of uniformed SDF personnel is limited to cases where the consent of the countries hosting the UN PKOs for which the dispatched uniformed SDF personnel will conduct operations and
of state parties to the confl ict regarding the implementation of the UN PKO (when the state parties to the confl ict are nonexistent, the consent of the countries where the UN PKOs are to be conducted)
is deemed to be stably maintained throughout the duration of the dispatch and where circumstances that lead to the suspension of the dispatch are deemed unlikely to occur

34 The MOD/SDF participated in the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) following the major earthquake that struck Haiti in 2010, but was unable to provide supplies and services
to the U.S. Forces engaged in disaster relief operations in Haiti outside the framework of UN PKOs, due to the absence of necessary domestic legislation.

35 The revision of the International Peace Cooperation Act in June 2017 added the Armed Forces of the U.K. to the scope as well.

36 The Japan Disaster Relief Team is not to be dispatched if the use of weapons is recognized to be necessary in order to protect the lives and bodies of people engaged in international disaster relief operations
or transport, and equipment necessary for such operations due to apparent danger in accordance with the level of security in the disaster-affected country. Therefore, members of the team will not carry

Commentary Duties of the Self Defense Forces **COLUMN**

The Ministry of Defense and Self Defense Forces are national administrative entities and obviously require a legal basis in carrying
out their respective duties. The Act for Establishment of the Ministry of Defense defi nes the administrative scope of the Ministry of
Defense, and Article 5 of the Act states that the Self Defense Forces Act determines the duties, actions, and authority of the Self
Defense Forces. The Self Defense Forces Act hence provides a list) similar to an index) of what the Self Defense Forces are allowed
to do in accordance with specifi ed procedures to address various situations.
Article 3 in the Self Defense Forces Act divides the duties of the Self Defense Forces into main duties (Item 1 of the same article)
and secondary duties (items 1 and 2 of the same article). Defense actions to defend Japan correspond to main duties, and only the
Self Defense Forces carry out these duties.
Secondary duties consist of “duties for maintaining public order as necessary” (secondary duties under item 1) and duties
defi ned by other laws “to an extent that does not interfere with performance of the main duties” (secondary duties under item 2).
The former includes public order actions that police entities cannot handle alone, maritime guarding actions, measures to destroy
ballistic missiles and other weapons, and measures to deal with airspace intrusions. The latter covers actions conducted in response
to important impact situations (logistical assistance), international peacekeeping activities (international peacekeeping tasks and
international emergency assistance), and activities related to international peace joint action situations (cooperative assistance, etc.).
These main and secondary duties are jointly known as “inherent duties.”
Activities handled by the Self Defense Forces on the basis that it is appropriate to utilize skills, experience, and organizational
functions cultivated by the Self Defense Forces over many years are known as “additional duties” (separate from inherent duties).
These include transportation for national guests, education and training consignments, and cooperation with athletic events.

1 Promotion of Various Preparations


Since the enforcement of the Legislation for Peace
and Security on March 29, 2016, the MOD/SDF has
undertaken various preparations for a variety of new
missions based on the Legislation for Peace and Security,
such as activities to raise awareness of legal systems
and intra-unit rules that were established, education of
SDF personnel, as well as development of educational
materials necessary for the actual training of various
units and the nurturing of instructors. In August 2016,
as these preparations were all but completed, each unit
of the SDF sets out to implement necessary training in
connection with the Legislation for Peace and Security.
Between Japan and the United States, and other bilateral
and multilateral joint training, Japan started to conduct
necessary training related to the Legislation for Peace and
Security after coordinating with the countries concerned.

2 Implementation of Training


In July 2017, the SDF conducted the fi rst exercise related to the
protection of U.S. vessels based on SDF Act Article 95-2 with
the intention to enhance the relationship with the U.S. Navy.
In the same year from July to August, the SDF took
part in multilateral exercise, Khaan Quest 2017, to elevate
various capabilities through conducting UN PKO-related
exercise based on International Peace Cooperation Act.



VOICE Participation in Training (Overseas) of Rescue **COLUMN**

of Japanese Nationals Overseas in FY2017 (domestic)

Central Readiness Regiment (Utsunomiya City, Tochigi),
S3, Lieutenant Colonel, Masachiyo Hirose

Rescue of Japanese Nationals Overseas require close collaboration with related agencies, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
in charge of protecting overseas Japanese people as a main duty and combined units from Ground, Maritime, and Air Self Defense
Forces. I participated in rescue training that brings together related parties as a staff offi cer for the destination dispatch team with
responsibility for all activities in the dispatch country.
The training begins from the point after which team members have already deployed at an overseas location. A Ground Self
Defense Forces vehicle handles ground transportation of Japanese people and others temporarily assembled at the temporary
assembly site (Soumagahara Camp, Gunma Prefecture) to the assembly location airport (Iruma Base, Saitama Prefecture). Boarding
procedures, such as confi rming identities and carry-on baggage checks, are conducted at the airport. The Japanese people and
others are then escorted onto the Air Self Defense Forces’ transport plane (C-130H) and Ground Self Defense Forces’ transport
helicopter (CH-47JA) for evacuation outside the country.
The training exercise, which consists of securing the safety of Japanese people and others jointly with the Foreign Ministry and
responding to continuously changing circumstances, provided an opportunity
to come into contact with the enthusiastic efforts of Foreign Ministry personnel
who are working for the same purpose of safely rescuing and transporting
Japanese people and others, clarifi ed the mutual capabilities and strengths of
the Foreign Ministry and Self Defense Forces, and reinforced the importance
of close collaboration.
I hope to continue improving my capabilities to carry out this duty through
enhancement of my profi ciency in regular regiment training in order to be ready
to implement the mission of immediately acting to rescue Japanese people and
others at any time and deeper mutual understanding and closer cooperation
with the Foreign Ministry and other agencies achieved through joint exercises.

Between September and October in Djibouti, and in
Japan in December 2017, the SDF conducted a training on
rescue of Japanese nationals overseas provided in SDF Act
Article 84-3 to improve its joint operation capabilities and
to strengthen cooperation with the relevant organizations.
Furthermore, between January and February 2018,
the SDF participated in a multilateral joint exercise
(Cobra Gold 18). In the command point exercise, the SDF
conducted training related to cooperation and support


operations under the International Peace Support Act as
well as training for rescue of Japanese nationals overseas
to improve its joint operation capabilities.
Moreover, in June 2018, the SDF took part in the
multilateral joint exercise “Khaan Quest 18” and improved
various capabilities through conducting training related to
the “joint protection of camps” and so-called “kaketsukekeigo” as well as “safety-ensuring operations” based on
the International Peace Cooperation Act.


2 Assignment of New Mission for the South Sudan PKO


**(2) So-Called “Kaketsuke-Keigo”**
“Kaketsuke-keigo” is to be conducted in very limited
situations, such as when those engaged in NGO activities,
etc. are attacked in locations close to the SDF engineering
unit and there are no UN units or others around to take
prompt actions. It is conducted in response to urgent
requests as a quick and temporary measure, within the
abilities of the unit in light of the humanitarian and urgent
nature of such measures. In the past, when SDF units
were dispatched to Timor-Leste and then Zaire (now the
Democratic Republic of the Congo), Japanese nationals
facing contingent circumstances in those countries asked
for protection by SDF units. On those occasions, the SDF
units, while they were not adequately trained for such
protection operations and their duties and authorities under
law were limited, made every effort to protect Japanese
nationals within the limits of their means, rushing to the
scene and transporting them to safe locations.[2]

“Kaketsuke-keigo” is a mission entailing risks. As
long as Japanese nationals overseas have the possibility
of facing contingent situations, however, the Government
believes that (1) the offi cial assignment of the solid duty of
“kaketsuke-keigo” and the necessary authority and (2) the
establishment of a steady structure with adequate training
beforehand, are conducive to not only contributing to the
safety of Japanese nationals overseas but also to reducing
risks to the SDF units.
Since SDF units have only self-protection
capabilities, “kaketsuke-keigo” represents only responses
that are feasible within their capabilities.
The military personnel of other countries usually possess
self-protection capabilities. Even then, if they are in a crisis
situation that they cannot handle by themselves, it is basically



1 Background


Japan deployed engineering units to the UN Mission in the
Republic of South Sudan (UNMISS) from January 2012
to the end of May 2017. Following the enforcement of the
Legislation for Peace and Security, after a comprehensive
consideration in light of the local situation and the training
for the new additional mission, the Government decided to
assign the duty of so-called “kaketsuke-keigo” starting with
the 11th Engineering Unit to be deployed to UNMISS, as
well as the duty of joint protection of camps. Following the
approval obtained at the 9-Minister Meeting of the National
Security Council, the Cabinet approved the revision of the
Implementation Plans for the International Peace Cooperation
Assignment for UNMISS on November 15, 2016.


Fundamental Concept regarding the Assignment

[2] of New Duties


In making the Cabinet Decision above, the Government
indicated its basic concept regarding the so-called
“kaketsuke-keigo” and joint protection of camps.[1] The
outline of the basic concept is as follows:

**(1) Premise**
The maintenance of security in South Sudan is, in
principle, the responsibility of the South Sudan public
security authorities and the South Sudan government
forces, complemented by troops of UNMISS. This
responsibility should be exclusively borne by the infantry
unit of UNMISS. What Japan deploys to South Sudan is
the SDF engineering unit, and thus the maintenance of
security there is not the duty of the unit.


“Fundamental Concept regarding the Assignment of New Duties” (announced by the Cabinet Secretariat, the Cabinet Offi ce, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Defense on November 15, 2016)

At the Diet, Prime Minister Abe has responded as follows: “In the past, when SDF units were dispatched to Timor-Leste and then Zaire, Japanese nationals facing contingent circumstances in those
countries asked for protection by SDF units. The SDF units, while they were not adequately trained and their duties and authorities were limited, made every effort to protect Japanese nationals. If the
SDF unit is near the scene, the unit cannot just stand by and do nothing even though it has the ability to help them. (Abridged) Previously, however, a legal framework to deal with such a situation did
not exist, and as a result, the SDF personnel at the scene managed to deal with the situation by themselves. This should not happen essentially.” (Prime Minister Abe’s response, Plenary Session of

infantry troops that are mobilized for their protection. The
Government considers that the SDF engineering unit that
does not possess the capability needed for the maintenance
of security is not assumed to conduct “kaketsuke-keigo” of
the military personnel of other countries.
In view of the track record of past activities, the area
of activities in South Sudan is limited to “Juba and its
surrounding area” starting with the 11th Engineering Unit
deployed in that country. The implementation of “kaketsukekeigo” is also limited to within this area of activities.

**(3) Joint Protection of Camps**
In the fi eld of UN PKOs, etc., it is usual practice for
personnel of multiple countries to cooperate in their
activities. In South Sudan as well, the SDF unit and units
of Rwanda and some other countries share one camp as
their base of activities.
Even if such a camp is attacked by an armed group,
the SDF unit previously could not respond to the situation
in cooperation with other units and could not participate


even in the daily training.
However, as long as the SDF unit shares the same
camp with the military personnel of other countries, an
injury to the personnel of other countries could lead to
SDF personnel being attacked. The military personnel of
other countries and the SDF personnel share a common
destiny so to speak. If they coordinate their responses,
they can better enhance the security of both of them.
Furthermore, it is believed that as SDF personnel and the
military personnel of other countries would be able to
constantly engage in joint training, this would lead to the
enhanced security of the camp as a whole.
As seen above, the joint protection of camps is
intended to enhance the personnel’s own safety in a
severe security situation. The Government considers
that the SDF unit is able to conduct its activities more
smoothly and safely, which would contribute to reducing
the risks posed to the SDF unit.

[See]

Operations), Part III, Chapter 2, Section 3, Article 2-2 (UN
Mission in the Republic of South Sudan)


3  The Operationalization of the Protection of Weapons and Other Equipment of the Units of the Armed
Forces of the United States and Other Countries (SDF Law Article 95-2)


**(1) Basic Principles of Implementing Article 95-2**
a. Purpose of Article 95-2
This Article is to enable SDF personnel to carry out very
passive and limited use of weapons to the minimum
extent necessary to protect weapons and other equipment
(“the weapons, etc.”) of units of the U.S. Forces, armed
forces of other countries or other similar organizations
(“the U.S. Forces, etc.”), that are concurrently engaged in
activities that contribute to the defense of Japan (including
joint exercises but excluding activities conducted in
places where combat activities are actually occurring) in
cooperation with the SDF, from infringements which do
not amount to an armed attack, because the weapons, etc.
can be regarded as an important material means which
constitute the defense capability of Japan.
Through the provision of Paragraph 1 of the Article
that “excluding activities conducted in places where
combat activities are actually occurring,” it is ensured that
asset protection is not to be, nor to be legally regarded
as being integrated (“ittaika”) with the use of force of
the U.S. Forces, etc. and that the SDF personnel never
respond to any combat activities by the use of weapons
pursuant to the Article. The SDF personnel thus never
conduct use of force and this prevents the situation from
evolving into combat activities as a result of the use of
d th i i f th A ti l


1 Background


Since the enactment of the Legislation for Peace and
Security, the MOD/SDF have been explaining to and
coordinating with the United States and also engaged in the
work to develop necessary rules and regulations in order to
ensure appropriate operation of the system for the protection
of weapons, etc., of the units of the U.S. Forces and the
armed forces of other foreign countries (SDF Law Article
95-2). Upon completion of these works, in December 2016,
at the National Security Council the Government decided
on the Implementation Guidelines concerning Article 95-2
of the SDF Law, and started applying the article to the U.S.
Forces operations. This operationalization helps to further
strengthen coordinated surveillance between the SDF and
the U.S. Forces and also to further enhance deterrence
and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S. Alliance.


The Implementation Guidelines for Article 95-2

The Implementation Guidelines for Article 95-2 of the SDF
Law set forth the Government’s basic understanding on the
article as well as basic principles on the involvement of the
Cabinet and disclosure of information in implementing the

This use of weapons does not fall under use of
force” which is banned in Article 9 of the Constitution.
b. Activities that Contribute to the Defense of Japan
“Activities that contribute to the defense of Japan” in the
Article may include mainly the following ones, while the
Government of Japan is to examine each activity on a
case-by-case basis: (1) ISR activities including ballistic
missile alert; (2) transportation and replenishment
activities in “situations that will have an important
infl uence”; and (3) joint exercises to enhance capabilities
required for defending Japan
c. Judgment on Whether or Not to Conduct Asset Protection
When the Minister of Defense receives a request from the
U.S. Forces, etc., the Minister subjectively should judge
whether the activities conducted by the units of the U.S.
Forces, etc. in cooperation with the SDF are “activities
that contribute to the defense of Japan” and whether
asset protection by the SDF personnel is necessary, by
considering the objective and content of the activities,
capability of the unit, types of weapons, etc. of the unit
and surrounding circumstances including possibility of
combat activity as well as the impacts on performance of
the SDF’s regular operations.

**(2) Involvement of the Cabinet**
Requests from the U.S. Forces, etc. based on Paragraph 2
of the Article should be deliberated in the National Security
Council (NSC) before the Minister of Defense judges on
conducting asset protection if the Minister receives requests
in the following cases. However, in case there is no time
for dealing with an urgent request by the U.S. Forces, etc.,
the Minister should promptly report to the NSC regarding
judgment of providing asset protection. (1) The U.S.
Forces, etc. makes a request for the fi rst time after the
operationalization of asset protection. (2) The request is
made for asset protection in the territory of a third country.


(3) The request is recognized as peculiarly important,
although not falling under the above two categories. In
addition, in case asset protection under the situations that
will have an important infl uence (*) is requested, the Prime
Minister should clearly state it in the Basic Plan and should
ask for a Cabinet decision on it after deliberations in the
NSC. (*) “Situations that will have an important infl uence”
is provided in Article 1 of the Law Concerning Measures to
Ensure Peace and Security of Japan in Situations that Will
Have an Important Infl uence on Japan’s Peace and Security,
Act No. 11 of 1999. The National Security Council Board
is to be held fl exibly and support the full National Security
Council. In addition, the relevant ministries and agencies
are to share information on requests for protection and
closely cooperate with each other.

**(3) Disclosure of Information**
In the implementation of Article 95-2, if an unusual event occurs
in conducting asset protection operation, the Government
promptly discloses such an event, and releases a basic plan
that specifi es matters concerning the implementation of asset
protection operations in a situation that will have an important
infl uence on Japan’s peace and security. The Government
also strives for appropriate disclosure of information in light
of the Act on Access to Information Held by Administrative
Organs (Act No. 42 of 1999).


3 Track Record of Asset Protection Operations


In 2017, during a joint exercises to improve the capabilities
necessary to defend Japan, the SDF conducted asset
protections for US military vessels and aircraft once
individually in 2017.

Other Equipment of the Units of the United States Forces and
Other Foreign Countries)


4 Conclusion of the New Japan-U.S. Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA)


In September, 2016, the Minister for Foreign Affairs
and U.S. Ambassador to Japan signed the Japan-U.S.
Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA).
ACSA was approved by the Diet and took effect in 2017.
The ACSA was prepared as a new agreement to
replace the previous Japan-U.S. ACSA to enable the
application of existing settlement procedures to the
provision of supplies and services from the SDF to
the U.S. Forces that become possible under the newly
enacted Legislation for Peace and Security. The new
ACSA bl th th d diti i i f


a broad range of supplies and services between the SDF
and the U.S. Forces, thereby raising the levels of specifi c
on-site cooperation between them.
Japan also signed ACSA with the U.K and Australia
other than the United States in light of the Legislation for
Peace and Security, etc., which obtained Diet approval along
with the Japan-U.S. ACSA and took effect in the same year.

**Strengthening of**

**4**

**the Japan-U.S. Alliance**


Based on the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, the JapanU.S. Security Arrangements, together with Japan’s own
efforts, constitute the cornerstone for Japan’s security.
The Japan-U.S. Alliance centered on bilateral security
arrangements functions as public goods that contribute to
the stability and prosperity, not only of Japan but also of
the Asia-Pacifi c region and the world at large.
As the security environment surrounding Japan
becomes increasingly severe, it has become more
important than ever to strengthen the Japan-U.S. Alliance
for the security of Japan with the United States that
maintains and strengthens its engagement and presence
in the Asia-Pacifi c region.
The military presence of U.S. Forces Japan (USFJ)

**Section 1 Signifi cance of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements**


1 Maintenance of Japan’s Peace and Security


not only contributes to the defense of Japan, but also
functions as deterrence and response capabilities to address
contingencies in the Asia-Pacifi c region, and serves as a
core element of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.
In this manner, the stationing of USFJ based on the
Japan-U.S. Security Treaty not only contributes to the
interests of Japan but also to the interests of the United
States, which has an interest in this region.
On the other hand, since the stationing of USFJ
impacts the living environment of local residents,
efforts that correspond to the actual situation of each
region must be made to mitigate the impact on regions
such as Okinawa.

**Signifi cance of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements**

Japan, based on Article 5 of the Japan-U.S. Security
Treaty, and Japan will provide facilities and areas for the
U.S. Forces, based on Article 6 of the treaty. If a nation
plans to attack Japan, the attacker must be prepared to
confront not only the defense capability of the SelfDefense Forces (SDF), but also the overwhelming military


In the current international community, a robust defense
system capable of responding to every contingency,
ranging from all types of armed attacks including the
use of nuclear weapons to coercion or intimidation by
military power, is necessary to secure the peace, security,
and sovereignty of the nation.
However, it is diffi cult even for the United States to
guarantee its security on its own. Much more than that, it
would be diffi cult for Japan to ensure its national security
solely through its unilateral efforts given its population,
land, and economy. Moreover, such a strategy would not
necessarily contribute to regional stability.
Consequently, Japan has maintained its peace and
security, centered on the Security Arrangements with the
world’s dominant military power, the United States, with
which it shares basic values such as democracy, the rule of
law, respect for human rights, and a capitalist economy as
well as an interest in maintaining the peace and security
of the world, and has strong economic ties.
Specifi cally, Japan and the United States will take

strength of the United States, due to the U.S. obligation to
defend Japan in the event of an armed attack. As a result,
the opposing nation clearly recognizes that it will suffer
grievously if it carries out an invasion, and such desires
will be abandoned at the planning stage. In other words,


this serves as deterrence against attacks.
Japan intends to create a seamless posture and
secure its peace and security by effectively utilizing the
deterrence capabilities of the U.S. military as well as
maintaining its own adequate defense capability.


2 Maintenance of Peace and Stability in the Region Surrounding Japan


Article 6 of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty states that
contributing to the security of Japan and the maintenance
of international peace and security in the Far East is the
purpose of the use of facilities and areas by USFJ. This
provision is based on the recognition that the security of
Japan is closely tied to the peace and security of the Far
East region to which Japan belongs.
In the regions surrounding Japan, there are many
states and the like with massive military power, including
some states that retain nuclear weapons or continue
nuclear development. In addition to issues or tension
caused by changes in the balance of power, situations that
we call “gray zones” over sovereignty of the territory or
vested interests are likely to arise, and this risks further
aggravation of the situation.
In such a security environment, the military
presence of USFJ provides deterrence against unexpected


contingencies caused by various security issues or
destabilizing factors, not only protecting the interests of
Japan and the United States but also providing a great
sense of security to the nations in the region and thus
fulfi lling a role as public goods.
Also, the close bonds of cooperation based on
the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements constitute the
foundation of the United States’ commitment to the peace
and stability of the region surrounding Japan. These
arrangements, complemented by the alliances established
between the United States and other countries in the
region such as the Republic of Korea, Australia, Thailand
and the Philippines and also by the friendly relations
developed with other countries, play an indispensable
role in maintaining the peace and stability of the AsiaPacifi c region.


3 Further Stabilization of the International Security Environment


The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements are the foundation
for a comprehensive and friendly cooperative relationship
between Japan and the United States, not only in defense
but also in a wide range of areas, including politics,
economy, and society.
The Japan-U.S. Alliance, with these security
arrangements at its core, also forms the axis of Japan’s
foreign policy. It contributes to Japan’s ability to
implement positive efforts to maintain the peace and
security of the international community, including
promotion of multinational security dialogue and
cooperation, and cooperation with the United Nations.
Currently, we are confronted with global security
challenges that are extremely diffi cult for any single
country to tackle alone, including the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles,
international terrorism, and acts of piracy, as well as
new risks concerning stable use of the seas, outer space
and cyberspace, and it is important for countries to


work together from peacetime. The strong bonds forged
between Japan and the United States are also playing an
important role in the efforts implemented by Japan to
effectively respond to such challenges.
In particular, under the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements, the SDF and the U.S. Forces are working
together in peacetime in a variety of areas to strengthen
their cooperation. This close coordination lays the
foundation for various forms of global collaboration such
as antipiracy, undertaken by the SDF and the U.S. Forces,
and leads to enhancement of the operational effectiveness
of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.
The peace and prosperity of the international
community are closely linked to those of Japan.
Accordingly, by cooperating with the United States,
Japan is able to advance measures to further stabilize the
global security environment. This in turn is enhancing the
security and prosperity of Japan.

**Section 2** **[Initiatives to Build the Foundation for Strengthening ]**
**the Alliance**


1 Background to the Strengthening of the Alliance

Since the conclusion of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty
in 1960, Japan and the United States have built a robust
alliance based on democratic ideals, respect for human
rights, the rule of law and common interests. During the
Cold War era, the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements
ensured the safety of Japan as a country with a liberal
ideology and also contributed to the peace and stability in
the region, including the formulation of the Guidelines for
Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation (“Guidelines”) in 1978
with a focus on responses to an armed attack on Japan.
Following the end of the Cold War, the leaders of
Japan and the United States announced the Japan-U.S.
Joint Declaration on Security in 1996, reaffi rming the
importance of the Japan-U.S. Alliance in light of the
state of affairs in the Asia-Pacifi c region following the
Cold War. Upon the Declaration, the fi nal report was
compiled at the Special Action Committee on Okinawa
(SACO) at the end of that year. As part of the promotion
of cooperative relations presented in the Declaration, the
Japan-United States Security Consultative Committee
(SCC) (“2+2” Meeting) held in the following year (1997)
approved the aforementioned 1997 Guidelines[1] and
expanded cooperation to responses in situations in areas
surrounding Japan in light of changes in the security
environment, such as the end of the Cold War.
In light of further changes to the security environment
due to the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 and the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, following
the “2+2” Meeting in December 2002, Japan and the
United States held working-level and other consultations
as part of bilateral strategic dialogue on security from the
perspective of how to make the Japan-U.S. Alliance’s
capacity more effective to adapt to the changing times.
As a result of a number of these Japan-U.S. consultations,
the direction of the Japan-U.S. Alliance was arranged in
three stages. These stages are: confi rmation of common
strategic objectives to both countries, including enhancing
peace and stability in the Asia-Pacifi c region (fi rst stage)
in February 2005; the announcement of the results of
the examination of the roles, missions, and capabilities
of Japan and the United States for accomplishing the
common strategic objectives (second stage) in October


2005; and the formulation of the United States-Japan
Roadmap for Realignment Implementation, a program
for implementing specifi c measures for the realignment of
USFJ, (third stage) in May 2006.

[See] Reference 20 (United States-Japan Roadmap for Realignment

[See]

Implementation [tentative translation])

Japan and the United States at the “2+2” Meeting
in May 2007 reconfi rmed and updated their common
strategic objectives. In February 2009, the two countries
signed the Agreement between the Government of Japan
and the Government of the United States of America
Concerning the Implementation of the Relocation
of III Marine Expeditionary Force Personnel and
Their Dependents from Okinawa to Guam (the Guam
International Agreement), which entered into force in
May 2009.
At the “2+2” Meeting in June 2011, the two countries
reviewed and revalidated their common strategic
objectives set forth in the Joint Statements of the previous
“2+2” Meetings, including maintenance of maritime
security domain by defending the principle of freedom
of navigation and maintenance of bilateral cooperation
with respect to protection of and access to outer space
and cyberspace, and discussed a diverse range of areas,
including an expansion of information sharing and joint
ISR activities.
In the Joint Statement of the “2+2” Meeting in
April 2012, Japan and the United States announced that
they decided to adjust the plans outlined in the United
States-Japan Roadmap for Realignment Implementation
(Realignment Roadmap) of May 2006, considering
signifi cant progress on the realignment of the U.S. Forces
stationed in Japan since the “2+2” Meeting in June 2011 as
well as the security environment in the Asia-Pacifi c region.

[See] Reference 21 (Joint Statement of the Security Consultative

Committee (2+2) (tentative translation) (April 27, 2012)

Since the formulation of the 1997 Guidelines,
the security environment surrounding Japan has
become increasingly severe, and as the activities and
responsibilities of the SDF have expanded, it had
become necessary for the nature of the Japan-U.S.
defense cooperation to adapt to those changes. Against

environment surrounding Japan; such as more active
military activities of neighboring countries, new threats
including international terrorist organizations and risks
against the stable use of global commons such as oceans,
outer space and cyberspace. In addition, the activities of
the SDF have expanded to a global scale, as exemplifi ed
by anti-piracy activities, PKO, and international disaster
relief activities.
As a result, it had become necessary for the manner
of Japan-U.S. defense cooperation to be adapted to these
changes in the security environment and the expansion of
the SDF’s activities and missions.
Against the backdrop of these changes in the security
environment, Prime Minister Abe directed then Minister
of Defense Onodera at the end of 2012 to work on the
revision of the Guidelines and other matters. In addition,
at the Japan-U.S. Summit Meeting held in February 2013,
P i Mi i t Ab t t d t th U S P id t Ob


It is necessary for both Japan and the United States to
discuss and decide the roles each will fulfi ll in case of an
armed attack against Japan or other situation in advance,
with a view to responding rapidly to such an event.
The Guidelines and the various policies for ensuring
their effectiveness provide a framework pertaining to rolesharing between Japan and the United States. Based on
that framework and the changing security environment
surrounding Japan, both Japan and the United States have
continuously studied bilateral cooperation plans for the two
countries, held consultations on them, and worked on the
revision of the Guidelines to adapt to the current situations.


1 Background to the Revision of the Guidelines


Since the formulation of the 1997 Guidelines, various
issues and destabilizing factors have emerged, and
b i ibl d t d i th it

that, in response to the changing security environment,
Japan would like to start reviewing the Guidelines
through discussions on the two countries’ views of the
roles, missions and capabilities (RMC).”
Against the background described above, at the
Japan-U.S. SCC or “2+2” Meeting in October 2013,
the Ministers directed the Subcommittee for Defense
Cooperation (SDC) to draft recommended changes to the
1997 Guidelines, and this task was to be completed by
the end of 2014.
The Joint Statement of the “2+2” Meeting at that
time identifi ed several objectives for the revision of
the 1997 Guidelines, including ensuring the Alliance’s
capacity to respond to an armed attack against Japan,
as a core aspect of Japan-U.S. defense cooperation;
expanding the scope of cooperation, to refl ect the global
nature of the Japan-U.S. Alliance, encompassing such
areas as counter-terrorism and counter-piracy; evaluating
the concepts that guide bilateral defense cooperation in
contingencies to ensure effective, effi cient, and seamless
Alliance response in a dynamic security environment that
includes challenges in emerging strategic domains such
as space and cyberspace; and exploring additional ways
in which we can strengthen the Alliance in the future to
meet shared objectives.
Based on the Joint Statement of the “2+2” Meeting in
October 2013 and in line with approaches indicated in the
2013 National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG) and
the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) of the United
States, Japan and the United States conducted extensive
work on the revision of the 1997 Guidelines.
In October 2014, based on the agreement reached at
the Japan-U.S. Defense Ministerial Meeting held in July
2014, the two governments announced “The Interim Report
on the Revision of the Guidelines for Japan- U.S. Defense
Cooperation.” In addition, in December 2014, the SCC
(“2+2” Meeting), recognizing the signifi cance of ensuring
consistency between the revision of the Guidelines and
Japan’s legislative process, decided to further deepen the
discussions to work towards fi nalizing the revision of the
Guidelines during the fi rst half of 2015, taking into account
the progress of Japan’s legislative process.
The Japan-U.S. SCC approved the new Guidelines
recommended by the SDC at the “2+2” Meeting in April
2015, thereby accomplishing the objective of revising the
Guidelines as outlined by the Ministers in October 2013.

[See] Reference 19 (The Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense

Cooperation (April27, 2015))


2 Content of the Guidelines


The Guidelines, which replace the 1997 Guidelines,
update the general framework and policy direction for
the roles and missions of the two countries and manifest
a strategic vision for a more robust Alliance and greater
shared responsibilities by modernizing the Alliance and
enhancing its deterrence and response capabilities in all
phases, from peacetime to contingencies.

**(1) Defense Cooperation and the Aim of the Guidelines**
The Guidelines newly specifi ed the matters to be
emphasized in security and defense cooperation. The
objectives of the new Guidelines are retained in line with
the approach of the 1997 Guidelines.

-  In order to ensure Japan’s peace and security under
any circumstances, from peacetime to contingencies,
and to promote a stable, peaceful, and prosperous
Asia-Pacifi c region and beyond, bilateral security and
defense cooperation will emphasize:

-  seamless, robust, fl exible, and effective bilateral
responses;

-  synergy across the two governments’ national
security policies;

-  a whole-of-government Alliance approach;

-  cooperation with regional and other partners, as
well as international organizations; and

-  the global nature of the Japan-U.S. Alliance

-  The two governments will maintain their individual
defense postures based on their national security
policies. The United States will continue to extend
deterrence to Japan through the full range of
capabilities, including U.S. nuclear forces. The United
States also will continue to forward deploy combatready forces in the Asia-Pacifi c region and maintain
the ability to reinforce those forces rapidly.

-  The Guidelines provide the general framework and
policy direction for the roles and missions of Japan and
the United States, as well as ways of cooperation and
coordination.

-  The Guidelines promote domestic and international
understanding of the signifi cance of the Japan-U.S.
Alliance.


**(2) Basic Premises and Principles**
The basic premises and principles maintain the approaches
of the 1997 Guidelines as described below:

-  The rights and obligations under the Japan-U.S.
Security Treaty and its related arrangements will
remain unchanged.

|III. S trengthened Alliance Coordination|Effective bilateral cooperation under the Guidelines will require the two governments to conduct close, consultative dialogue and sound policy and operational coordination from peacetime to contingencies. For this purpose, the two governments will establish a new, standing Alliance Coordination Mechanism, enhance operational coordination, and strengthen bilateral planning. A. Alliance Coordination Mechanism In order to address issues seamlessly and effectively any situation that affects Japan’s peace and security or any other situation that may require an Alliance response, the two governments will utilize the Alliance Coordination Mechanism, and will strengthen policy and operational coordination related to activities conducted by the SDF and the United States Armed Forces in all phases from peacetime to contingencies. The two governments will establish necessary procedures and infrastructure (including facilities as well as information and communication systems) and conduct regular training and exercises. B. Enhanced Operational Coordination The two governments recognize the importance of collocating operational coordination functions. The SDF and the United States Armed Forces will exchange personnel to ensure robust information sharing, to facilitate coordination and to support international activities. C. Bilateral Planning In peacetime, the two governments will develop and update bilateral plans through the Bilateral Planning Mechanism. Bilateral plans are to be ref lected appropriately in the plans of both governments.|||
|IV. S eamlessly Ensuring Japan’s Peace and Security|● The two governments will take measures to seamlessly ensure Japan’s peace and security in all phases from peacetime to contingencies, including situations when an armed attack against Japan is not involved. In this context, the two governments also will promote further cooperation with partners. ● The two governments will utilize the Alliance Coordination Mechanism as appropriate, for assessment of the situation, sharing of information, as well as f lexible deterrent options and actions aimed at de-escalation. The two governments also will coordinate strategic messaging through appropriate channels. A. Cooperative Measures during Peacetime • The two governments will promote cooperation across a wide range of areas, to strengthen the deterrence and capabilities of the Japan- U.S. Alliance. • The SDF and the United States Armed Forces will enhance interoperability, readiness, and vigilance. To these ends, the two governments will take measures, including, but not limited to: (1) Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance; (2) Air and Missile Defense; (3) Maritime Security; (4) Asset Protection; (5) Training and Exercises; (6) Logistic Support; and (7) Use of Facilities. B. Responses to Emerging Threats to Japan’s Peace and Security • The Alliance will respond to situations that will have an important inf luence on Japan’s peace and security. Such situations cannot be def ined geographically. The measures described in this section include those that may be taken, in accordance with the two countries’ respective laws and regulations, in circumstances that have not yet amounted to such a situation. • In addition to continuing cooperative measures during peacetime, the two governments will pursue all avenues. Utilizing the Alliance Coordination Mechanism, the two governments will take additional measures, based on their own decisions, including, but not limited to: (1) Noncombatant Evacuation Operations; (2) Maritime Security; (3) Measures to Deal with Refugees; (4) Search and Rescue; (5) Protection of Facilities and Areas; (6) Logistic Support; and (7) Use of Facilities. C. Actions in Response to an Armed Attack against Japan Bilateral actions remain a core aspect of Japan-U.S. security and defense cooperation. 1. When an Armed Attack against Japan is Anticipated The two governments will take measures to deter an armed attack and to de-escalate the situation, while making preparations necessary for the defense of Japan. 2. When an Armed Attack against Japan Occurs • Principles for Coordinated Actions The two governments will take appropriate and coordinated actions to promptly repel the attack and deter any further attacks. The SDF will have primary responsibility to conduct defensive operations, and the United States Armed Forces will support and supplement the SDF. • Concept of Operations Self-Defense Forces (SDF) United States Armed Forces Conduct bilateral operations to defend airspace above and surrounding Japan Operations to Defend Have primary responsibility for conducting air Conduct operations to support and supplement SDF Airspace defense operations while ensuring air superiority operations Conduct bilateral operations to counter ballistic missile attacks against Japan Operations to Counter Have primary responsibility for conducting ballistic Conduct operations to support and supplement SDF Ballistic Missile Attacks missile defense operations to defend Japan operations Conduct bilateral operations to defend waters surrounding Japan and to secure the safety of sea lines of communication Operations to Defend Have primary responsibility for the protection of Maritime Areas major ports and straits in Japan and of ships and Conduct operations to support and supplement SDF vessels in waters surrounding Japan and for other operations associated operations Conduct bilateral operations to counter ground attacks against Japan by ground, air, maritime, or amphibious forces Operations to Counter Have primary responsibility to prevent and repel Ground Attacks ground attacks, including those against islands, Conduct operations to support and supplement SDF and have primary responsibility for conducting air operations defense operations while ensuring air superiority|||

-----

Guidelines will be consistent with international law.

-  All actions and activities undertaken by Japan and
the United States will be in accordance with their
respective constitutions, laws and regulations then in
effect, and basic positions on national security policy.
Japan will conduct actions and activities in accordance
with its basic positions, such as the maintenance of its
exclusively national defense-oriented policy and its
three non-nuclear principles.

-  The Guidelines do not obligate either government to
take legislative, budgetary, administrative, or other

3 Major Initiatives for Strengthening the Alliance


measures, nor do the Guidelines create legal rights
or obligations for either government. Since the
objective of the Guidelines, however, is to establish an
effective framework for bilateral cooperation, the two
governments are expected to refl ect in an appropriate
way the results of these efforts, based on their own
judgment, in their specifi c policies and measures.

[See] Reference 19 (The Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense

[See]

Cooperation (April 27, 2015))
Fig. II-4-2-2 (Outline of the Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense
Cooperation)

that (1) it is the standing mechanism utilizable from
peacetime; (2) it can be utilized for large-scale natural
disasters in Japan as well as for cooperation in the AsiaPacifi c region and globally; and (3) it enables whole-ofgovernment coordination while ensuring the involvement
of relevant Japanese and U.S. organizations. These
characteristics enable the Japanese and U.S. Governments
to respond appropriately and promptly when the need for
coordination arises. For example, in the event of a largescale natural disaster in Japan, it would require a diversity
of coordination in the policy and operational aspects
related to activities of the SDF and the U.S. Forces. The
utilization of this mechanism makes it possible to conduct
close and appropriate coordination with the involvement of
relevant Japanese and U.S. organizations at various levels.
Since the establishment of the mechanism, Japan
and the United States have been utilizing the mechanism
to coordinate closely, including in response to the 2016
Kumamoto Earthquake, the ballistic missile launches by
North Korea, and Chinese activities in the waters and
airspace around the Senkaku Islands.

[See] Fig. II-4-2-3 (The Framework of Alliance Coordination

Mechanism (ACM))


The Guidelines defi ne that the two countries will work
on a variety of measures, including ISR activities, air and
missile defense, maritime security, and bilateral training
and exercises, and cooperate in response to a large-scale
disaster in Japan in order to “seamlessly ensure Japan’s
peace and security.” The Guidelines also require both
countries to work on “Cooperation for Regional and Global
Peace and Security,” through cooperation in international
activities and trilateral and multilateral cooperation; to
cooperate for Space and Cyberspace Cooperation which
are emerging as new strategic domains; and to develop
and enhance “Bilateral Enterprise” through defense
equipment and technology cooperation for further
improving the effectiveness of bilateral cooperation.
Many of these items are incorporated into the NDPG
to “strengthen the Alliance’s deterrence and response
capabilities” and to “strengthen and expand cooperation
in a variety of areas.”

1 Strengthened Coordination within the Alliance


**(1) Establishment of the Alliance Coordination**
**Mechanism**

In November 2015, the Japanese and U.S. Governments
established the ACM in order to address seamlessly
and effectively any situation that affects Japan’s peace
and security or any other situation that may require an
Alliance response.
Based on the framework shown in Fig. II-4-2-4, this
mechanism coordinates policy and operational aspects
related to activities conducted by the SDF and the U.S.
Forces in all phases from peacetime to contingencies.
This mechanism also contributes to timely information
sharing as well as to the development and maintenance of
common situational awareness.
Th h t i ti f th h i i l d


**(2) Enhanced Operational Coordination**
Based on the Guidelines, the Japanese and U.S.
Governments recognize the importance of collocating
operational coordination functions. The SDF and the
U.S. Forces will exchange personnel to ensure robust
information sharing, to facilitate coordination and to
support international activities.

**(3) Establishment of the Bilateral Planning Mechanism**

of implementing the development of bilateral plans in
peacetime in line with the Guidelines in order to enable
effective bilateral responses to contingencies relevant to
Japan’s peace and security.
In the development of bilateral plans, this mechanism
performs the functions of ensuring Ministerial-level
directions and supervision and the involvement of
relevant government ministries and agencies, as well as
conducting coordination for various forms of Japan-U.S.
cooperation conducive to the development of bilateral
plans. The two governments will conduct bilateral
planning through this mechanism.

of the activities of both countries, the two countries set
up the Defense ISR Working Group in February 2013
consisting of director-level defense offi cials from Japan
and the United States, which is further deepening the
cooperation between the two countries.
The expansion of these ISR activities will
function as deterrence capabilities, and will also ensure
information superiority over other nations and enable the
establishment of a seamless cooperation structure in all
phases from peacetime to contingencies.

**(2) Missile Defense**
Regarding the response to ballistic missiles, Japan-U.S.
bilateral response capabilities have been enhanced by
sharing operation information and establishing response
procedures. For the repeated ballistic missile launches
by North Korea, Japan and the United States have
conducted coordinated responses utilizing the ACM.
Also, in the systems and technology fi eld, the cooperative
development of a new ballistic missile defense (BMD)
interceptor with enhanced capabilities (SM-3 Block IIA)
is steadily in progress.

**(3) Maritime Security**
The Guidelines allow Japan and the United States to
develop and enhance the system for sharing maritime
surveillance information from peacetime and to
cooperate where appropriate for the maintenance and
enhancement of the presence of Japan and the United
States through ISR as well as training and exercises.
The Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) and the U.S.
Navy plan to maintain and enhance both countries’
presence in the Western Pacifi c through multiple joint
training and exercises.

**(4) Bilateral Training and Exercises**
Bilateral training in peacetime not only contribute greatly
to maintaining and enhancing the Japan-U.S. bilateral

the deepening of mutual understanding of tactics and other
aspects and the enhancement of mutual communication,
but also are useful in improving tactical skills on each
side. In particular, the knowledge and techniques that
the Japanese side can learn from the U.S. Forces, which
have vast experience in actual fi ghting, are invaluable and
greatly contribute to improving SDF capabilities.
In addition, conducting bilateral training at effective
times, places, and scales demonstrates the unifi ed
commitment and capabilities of Japan and the United
States, which has a deterrent effect. In light of these
perspectives, the MOD/SDF is continuing its initiatives
to enrich the contents of bilateral training and exercises.
Bilateral training have been expanded not only within
Japan but also to the United States by dispatching SDF

VOICE Participation in the exercise with the U.S. Marines Corps **COLUMN**

in the United States (Iron Fist 18)

Western Army Infantry Regiment (Sasebo, Nagasaki),
2nd Company Commander, Major, Yasuyuki Takamura

The Western Army Infantry Regiment was formed at the end of FY2017 as a central unit of the Amphibious Rapid Deployment
Brigade prior to its creation and engages in training throughout the year to be ready for immediate action.
Over roughly a month and a half from January 2018, it had the opportunity to participate in military training with the U.S.
Marines Corps in California (Iron Fist 18).
This training was very important in preparing the regiment before creation of the Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade and
improved profi ciency beyond existing levels through bilateral joint operation by Japanese and U.S. forces and combined training of a
variety of groups. The Regiment aimed to make the fullest use of U.S. military training facilities by engaging in amphibious operations
that are diffi cult to carry out in Japan. It set training goals for collaboration with an Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV) unit in landing
and subsequent ground battle and improvement of battle shooting profi ciency on a Company scale. I believe Regiment members
were exuding confi dence and returned to Japan as a more powerful unit after the training.
Leveraging this experience and confi dence, I intend to put even more effort into improving my skills as a member of the Infantry
Regiment that is a core component of the Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade and hope to contribute to the unit defending
Japanese islands.

Since FY1985, mostly on an annual basis,
command post exercises and field training exercises
have been conducted alternately as the Japan-U.S.

2018, command post exercises were conducted at the
Ministry of Defense in Ichigaya.
Also, in May and June 2017 Japanese and U.S. vessels,
including the destroyer JS Izumo conducted bilateral
maritime exercise in the South China Sea. Furthermore, as

the same year, the MSDF conducted bilateral exercise
in the Sea of Japan with a strike force comprising three
aircraft carriers the USS Ronald Reagan, the USS Nimitz,
and the USS Theodore Roosevelt and other vessels of the
U.S. Navy for the fi rst time. In conjunction with this, the
MSDF conducted Japan-U.S. bilateral crusing exercise
with the strike force from October to November 2017 in the
waters and air of the Sea of Japan, the East China Sea and

The Agreement is designed to positively contribute to
the smooth and effective operation under the Japan-U.S.
Security Treaty and to initiatives for international peace
taken under the leadership of the United Nations. Its scope
of application includes various occasions such as bilateral
training and exercises in peacetime, disaster relief
activities, UN peacekeeping operations, international
disaster relief activities, situations in areas surrounding
Japan, and armed attack situations. If either the SDF or the
U.S. Forces request the other party to provide supplies or
services, the Agreement, in principle, allows the requested
party to do so.[3] In addition, at the “2+2” Meeting in
April 2015, the two countries confi rmed that they would
expeditiously work on the negotiations on the ACSA to
operationalize the mutual logistics cooperation envisioned
by the new Guidelines. Subsequently, following the
passage of the Legislation for Peace and Security in
September 2015, the new Japan-U.S. ACSA was signed
in September 2016, ratifi ed by the Diet on April 14, 2017,
and entered into force on April 25. This has enabled the
same framework as the existing Japan-U.S. ACSA, such
as settlement procedures, to be applied to the provision of
supplies and services that had become possible under the
Legislation for Peace and Security, so that by December
2017 food and fuel has been provided to U.S. Forces
engaged in information collection and other activities.

[See] Chapter 3, Section 2-3-8 (Expansion of the Provisions of

Supplies and Services to the United States Armed Forces)
Chapter 3, Section 3-2 (Conclusion of the New Japan-U.S.
Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA))
Fig. II-4-2-5 (Japan-U.S. Acquisition and Cross-Servicing
Agreement (ACSA))

**(6) Joint/Shared Use**
The expansion of joint/shared use of facilities and areas
increases bases for the SDF’s activities such as maneuver
areas, ports, and airfi elds, which in turn enhances the
diversity and effi ciency of Japan-U.S. bilateral training
and exercises and expands the scope and raises the
frequency of such activities as ISR. The SDF has only
a limited number of facilities in Okinawa, including
Naha Air Base, and most of them are located in urban
areas, which results in operational limitations. The joint/
shared use of facilities and areas of USFJ in Okinawa
will greatly improve the SDF’s training environment in
Okinawa, and facilitate implementation of joint training
and exercises and increased interoperability between the


ASDF personnel attending a meeting for a Japan-U.S. joint training (Red Flag Alaska)

exercises with the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson and
other vessels of the U.S. Navy in the waters and air from
the northern part of the South China Sea to the area
around Okinawa. The ASDF also conducted multiple
training with U.S. Air Force B-1B, B-52 and U.S. Marine
F-35B in the airspace around western Kyushu and
around Okinawa.
The Japan-U.S. bilateral training were conducted
with the aim of enhancing the tactical skills of the SDF
and bolstering collaboration with the U.S. Forces. It
is believed that bolstering Japan-U.S. collaboration
and demonstrating bilateral ties as an outcome of
implementing these Japan-U.S. bilateral training have the
effect of further enhancing the deterrence and response
capabilities of the overall Japan-U.S. Alliance and
demonstrating Japan’s determination and high capacity
towards stabilizing the region in an increasingly severe
security environment for Japan.
In recent years, USFJ have also participated in
disaster drills organized by local governments, thereby
deepening cooperation with relevant institutions and
local governments.

in FY2017)


**(5) Logistics Support**
Japan-U.S. cooperation is also being steadily promoted
through logistics support based on the Acquisition and
Cross-Servicing Agreement[2] (ACSA) signed in 1996
and revised in 1999 and 2004, as a result of increased
opportunities for cooperation between the two countries.


The offi cial title is the Agreement between the Government of Japan and the Government of the United States of America Concerning Reciprocal Provision of Logistic Support, Supplies and Services
between the Self-Defense Forces of Japan and the Armed Forces of the United States of America.

The categories of supplies and services as provided under the Agreement include: food; water; billeting; transportation (including airlift); petroleum, oils, and lubricants; clothing; communications;
medical services; base support; storage; use of facilities; training services; spare parts and components; repair and maintenance; airport and seaport services; and ammunition (only in armed attack

Significance of reciprocal provision of supplies and services


In general, supplies and services necessary for unit operations are replenished by the units themselves. However, in such cases where
units of allied nations are operating together, the reciprocal provision of supplies and services on site would enhance the flexibility of
the operations.

SDF and the U.S. Forces. It will also improve readiness
and contribute to ensuring the safety of local people in
the case of a disaster.
Thus, while taking into account the SDF defense
posture in the regions, including the Southwestern Islands,
and relations with local communities, Japan and the
United States are proactively engaged in consultations,
and specifi c initiatives are steadily progressing. For
example, the GSDF has been using Camp Hansen since
March 2008 for exercises. Moreover, the relocation of the
ASDF Air Defense Command to Yokota in April 2012
and the relocation of the GSDF Central Readiness Force
Headquarters to Zama in March 2013 were carried out. In
addition, in December 2013 and between June and July
2014, the MSDF conducted the training on the sea and
training utilizing facilities in Guam and its surrounding
area in cooperation with the U.S. Navy. The development
of training ranges in Guam and the Northern Mariana
Islands (Tinian Island, Pagan Island, etc.) for shared use
by the SDF and the U.S. Forces is under consideration.


Cooperation in Response to a large-Scale

[3] Disaster in Japan

In the aftermath of the Great East Japan Earthquake in
2011, the SDF and the U.S. Forces demonstrated their
high-level joint response capabilities based on the strong
ties they had developed. The success of the joint response
between the U.S. Forces and the SDF through Operation
Tomodachi was the result of Japan-U.S. Bilateral Training
and Exercises over many years, and will lead to the
Alliance being deepened further in the future. Operation
Tomodachi involved the deployment of a large-scale force
at its peak, including troops of approximately 16,000
personnel, around 15 ships, and around 140 aircraft,
resulting in relief activities that were unprecedented in
scale and contributing greatly to Japan’s restoration and
reconstruction. Not only those affected but numerous
Japanese at large were fi lled with a deepened sense of
appreciation and trust for USFJ.
On the other hand, some issues have emerged,
such as clarifying the roles, missions and capabilities
of Japan and the United States in the event of a disaster
within Japan, as well as stipulating more concrete joint
id li t f ilit t t ti i ti b th U S

Forces in disaster prevention drills, and examining
mechanisms for the sharing of information and more
effective coordination mechanism.
In light of these issues, the December 2013 Response
Plan for a Massive Earthquake in the Nankai Trough listed
the Japan-U.S. Joint Response Plan, and the two countries
conducted a bilateral joint comprehensive disaster
prevention training in Kochi Prefecture in February 2014
based on the scenario of an earthquake occurring in the
Nankai Trough. USFJ also participated in the Wakayama
Prefecture Tsunami Disaster Readiness Practical Training
(October 2014) and Michinoku ALERT 2014 (November
2014), a disaster relief exercise by the GSDF Northeastern
Army. In this manner, the SDF and USFJ have been
enhancing their cooperation for disaster readiness.
In response to the Kumamoto Earthquake in 2016,
Japan-U.S. cooperation was manifested in the form of the
transportation of daily necessities by the Osprey (MV-22)
of the U.S. Marine Corps and the transportation of SDF
personnel by C-130 transport aircraft. The ACM was
utilized on that occasion, including the Japan-U.S. Joint
Coordination Offi ce locally established by the joint task
force organized for the earthquake response.


resolution based on international law. The two countries
have been working closely together on various multilateral
maritime security cooperation initiatives supported by
countries along the sea lanes, including participation in
the Combined Task Force (CTF) 151 for countering piracy
since December 2013, and the Proliferation Security
Initiative (PSI)[4] exercise Pacifi c Protector 17, hosted by
Australia in September 2017.

[See] Part III, Chapter 2, Section 2 (Ensuring Maritime Security)

[See]

Part III, Chapter 2, Section 4-2 (Proliferation Security Initiative)

**(2) Trilateral and Multilateral Training and Exercises**
The Guidelines enable Japan and the Unites States to
promote and enhance trilateral and multilateral security
and defense cooperation. Thus, the SDF is participating
in trilateral (e.g., Japan-U.S.-Australia, Japan-U.S.India, and Japan-U.S.-ROK) and multilateral training, in
addition to bilateral training and exercises between Japan
and the United States.


5 Space and Cyberspace Cooperation

**(1) Cooperation on Space**
With regard to cooperation on space, based on the
agreement at the Japan-U.S. Summit Meeting in
November 2009 to promote cooperation in the area of
space security as part of initiatives to deepen the JapanU.S. Alliance, the two countries have periodically been
working together to discuss how they should cooperate
in the future, such as the holding of the 1st Japan-U.S.
Space Security Dialogue in September 2010 with the
participation of relevant ministries and agencies.
Furthermore, the Japan-U.S. Summit Meeting in
April 2012 decided to deepen the space-based partnership
for civil and security purposes and to create a whole-of
government comprehensive dialogue on space, enabling
relevant ministries and agencies to hold the 1st whole
of- government Japan-U.S. Comprehensive Dialogue
on Space in March 2013. The two countries have been
sharing information on their respective space policies and
discussing plans for future cooperation on a regular basis.
Moreover, based on the instructions given by the
Japan-U.S. Defense Ministerial Meeting of April 2015,
the two countries established the Space Cooperation
Working Group (SCWG) to further promote the
cooperation among bilateral defense authorities in the
area of space. The SCWG has held four meetings in total
since its establishment in October 2015 (the most recent


Cooperation for Regional and Global Peace

[4] and Security


**(1) Cooperation in International Activities**
The SDF has conducted activities in close cooperation
with the United States and other participating countries
through activities pursuant to the former Anti-Terrorism
Special Measures Act, international disaster relief
activities and international peacekeeping operations in the
Philippines and Haiti, and anti-piracy operations off the
coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden. Japan and the
United States worked closely together at local multilateral
coordination centers to respond to the typhoon disaster
that hit the Philippines in November 2013. To respond
to the outbreak of the Ebola virus disease, Japan started
to dispatch liaison offi cers to the U.S. Africa Command
in October 2014, coordinating efforts and collecting
information with relevant countries including the United
States, for close cooperation.
As for maritime security, both Japan and the
United States have made efforts as maritime nations to
maintain and develop “open and stable seas” according to
fundamental rules such as securing the freedom and safety
of navigation, and the rule of law including peaceful dispute

meeting was in February 2018). Going forward, Japan
and the United States will leverage this working group to
deepen discussions in a wide variety of areas, including
(1) promoting space policy dialogue, (2) reinforcing
information sharing, (3) working together to develop
and secure experts, and (4) continued participation to
tabletop exercises.

**(2) Cooperation on Cyberspace**
Concerning cooperation on cyberspace, the Cyber Defense
Policy Working Group (CDPWG) was established in
October 2013 as a framework between the MOD and the
Department of Defense (DoD) to discuss a broad range
of professional and concrete issues, including the sharing
of information at the policy level, human resources
development, and technical cooperation.
The Guidelines released in April 2015 and the
CDPWG Joint Statement published in May 2015
cited the prompt and appropriate development of an
information sharing structure and the protection of
the critical infrastructure upon which the SDF and the
U.S. Forces depend to accomplish their missions as
examples of cooperation between the Japanese and
U.S. Governments. In addition, as part of cooperation
between the SDF and the U.S. Forces, the securing of
the resiliency of their respective networks and systems
and the implementation of educational exchanges and
bilateral exercises were also cited. Japan and the United
States will further accelerate bilateral cyber defense
cooperation in line with the direction presented by the
Guidelines and the CDPWG Joint Statement.


regardless of the Three Principles on Arms Exports
and related guidelines. In 1983, Japan established the
Exchange of Notes concerning the Transfer of Military
Technologies to the United States of America.[5] In 2006,
the Exchange of Notes concerning the Transfer of Arms
and Military Technologies to the United States of America[6]
was established to replace the foregoing Exchange of
Notes. Under these frameworks, Japan decided to provide
the United States with 20 items of arms and military
technologies, including military technologies related
to joint technological research on BMD. Japan and the
United States consult with each other at forums such as
the Systems and Technology Forum (S&TF) and conduct
cooperative research and development regarding the
specifi c projects agreed upon at these forums.
At the Japan-U.S. Defense Ministerial Meeting in
June 2016, the Ministers signed a Reciprocal Defense
Procurement Memorandum of Understanding (RDP
MOU).[7] The MOU promotes measures concerning the
procurement of equipment by Japanese and U.S. defense
authorities based on reciprocity (providing information
necessary to submit bids to businesses of the other
country, protecting submitted corporate information,
waiving restrictions on participation by businesses of the
other country, etc.).
Part III, Chapter 4, Section 4-2 (Deepening
Relationships with the United States regarding Defense
Equipment and Technology Cooperation) explains
initiatives for the common maintenance infrastructure
for the 24 MV-22 Ospreys[8] deployed by the U.S. Marine
Corps at MCAS Futenma and the Osprey planned to be
deployed by the GSDF7 as well as initiatives for the
onsite maintenance locations (regional depots) in the
Asia-Pacifi c region for F-35 fi ghter aircraft.

[See] Reference 23 (Japan-U.S. Joint Research and Development

Projects)

**(2) Education and Research Exchange**
The Guidelines recognize the importance of intellectual
cooperation relating to security and defense, and the
two governments will deepen exchanges between
members of relevant organizations, and strengthen
communication between each side’s research and
educational institutions. To this end, the MOD/SDF has
been working on education and research exchanges by
accepting students from abroad and holding Japan-U.S.


Initiatives to Further Improve the Effectiveness

[6] of Bilateral Cooperation

**(1) Defense Equipment and Technology Cooperation**
Japan proactively promotes cooperation in defense
equipment and technology while bearing in mind the
maintenance of the technological and production bases
and the mutual cooperation principle based on the JapanU.S. Security Treaty and the Mutual Defense Assistance
Agreement between Japan and the United States of America.
In view of the progress in technology cooperation
between Japan and the United States, the improvement
of technological level, and other factors, Japan decided
to transfer its military technology to the United States

related to Japan-U.S. cooperation in the area of security.
In addition, the MOD organizes Japan-U.S. defense
ministerial meetings between the Japanese Minister of
Defense and the U.S. Secretary of Defense as necessary
where discussions are made with a focus on the defense
policies of the respective governments and defense
cooperation. Furthermore, the Japanese State Minister of
Defense and the U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense work
together, and MOD offi cials, including the Administrative
Vice-Minister of Defense, the Chief of Staff of the Joint
Staff, the Vice-Minister of Defense for International
Affairs, and the Chiefs of Staff of the SDF, have workinglevel meetings when necessary and exchange information
with the U.S. DoD and others under the Japan-U.S.
Security Arrangements.
The sharing of information and views at every
opportunity and level between Japan and the United States
is undoubtedly conducive to the increased credibility of
the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, and results in
the further enhancement of close collaboration between


1 Various Policy Consultations


Japan and the United States have maintained close
coordination at multiple levels, including the summit level
and ministerial level, and have continually strengthened
and expanded cooperative relations for the peace,
stability and prosperity of not only the two countries but
also the entire international community, including the
Asia-Pacifi c region.
Close policy consultations on security are conducted
through diplomatic channels as well as between offi cials
in charge of defense and foreign affairs at multiple levels
in the Governments of Japan and the United States
through meetings such as the Japan-United States SCC
(“2+2” Meeting), the Security Subcommittee (SSC) and
the SDC. As the framework for ministerial consultations
among the top offi cials in charge of defense and foreign
affairs of the two countries, the SCC (“2+2” Meeting)
represents such policy consultations. The SCC functions
as an important consultative panel to discuss issues

**Section 3 Stationing of the U.S. Forces in Japan**


Measures such as realignment of U.S. Forces in Japan
are extremely important in mitigating the impact on
local communities, such as those in Okinawa, while
maintaining the deterrent capability of the U.S. Forces.

1 Stationing of the U.S. Forces in Japan


The MOD will advance the U.S. Forces realignment and
other initiatives while making continuous efforts to gain
the understanding and cooperation of local communities
hosting USFJ facilities and areas.

Treaty stipulates the obligation of the United States to
defend Japan, Article 6 allows the United States to use
facilities and areas in Japan for maintaining the security of
Japan and international peace and security in the Far East,
and overall Japan-U.S. obligations are kept in balance.


1 Signifi cance of the Presence of the U.S. Forces
in Japan

As the security environment surrounding Japan is
becoming increasingly severe, for the Japan-U.S.
Alliance, which is based on the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements, to adequately function as a deterrence
that contributes to Japan’s defense as well as the peace
and stability in the Asia-Pacifi c region, it is necessary to
secure the presence of the U.S. military in Japan and to
maintain a posture in Japan and the surrounding areas
from peacetime that enables USFJ to respond swiftly and
expeditiously to emergencies.
For this purpose, based on the Japan-U.S. Security
Treaty, Japan allows the stationing of USFJ, which is a
core part of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.
Further, the realization of a stable U.S. military
presence is necessary for a swift Japan-U.S. joint response
based on Article 5 of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty in
the event of an armed attack on Japan. Additionally, the
actions of USFJ in the defense of Japan will be assisted
by the timely reinforcement of other U.S. Forces, and
USFJ will serve as the basis of such support.
In order for USFJ to carry out the abovementioned
role, it is essential that all the services of the U.S. Forces,
including those in Japan, are functionally integrated. For
instance, when responding to armed aggression against
Japan in cooperation with the SDF, the U.S. Forces
primarily serve the role of “spear” through its offensive
power. When the U.S. Forces function as an offensive
power, it can be expected that the U.S. Navy, Air Force,
and Marine Corps stationed in Japan work in an integrated
manner to fully exert their functions.
In addition, while Article 5 of the Japan-U.S. Security


2 Measures to Ensure the Smooth Stationing of
the U.S. Forces in Japan

The Status of Forces Agreement[1] (SOFA) stipulates
matters pertaining to USFJ facilities and areas and the
status of USFJ, including furnishing of facilities and areas
for use by the U.S. Forces (USFJ facilities and areas), and
satisfying the labor requirements of USFJ.


**(1) Furnishing of JSDF Facilities and Areas**
Japan furnishes USFJ facilities and areas for the U.S.
Forces under the provisions of the SOFA, in accordance
with agreements reached through the Joint Committee
between the Governments of Japan and the United States.
The Government of Japan has entered into agreements
and concluded lease contracts with owners of private and
public lands on which USFJ facilities and areas exist in
order to ensure the stable use of these facilities and areas.
However, should the Government be unable to obtain the
approval of landowners, it will acquire title[3] under the
Act on Special Measures for USFJ Land Release,[2] while
compensating the landowners for any loss they may have
suffered in the process.

**(2) Satisfying labor Requirements of USFJ**
USFJ require manpower (labor) to maintain its forces, and
the SOFA stipulates that the requirements of USFJ shall be
satisfi ed with the assistance of the Government of Japan.


The offi cial title is the Agreement Under Article VI of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between Japan and the United States of America, Regarding Facilities and Areas and the Status of
United States Armed Forces in Japan.

The offi cial title is the Act on Special Measures for USFJ Land Release, Incidental to the Agreement Under Article VI of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between Japan and the United
States of America, Regarding Facilities and Areas and the Status of United States Armed Forces in Japan


-----

As of the end of FY2017, 25,803 USFJ local
employees (hereinafter referred to as the “employees”)
at USFJ facilities and areas throughout Japan, working as
offi ce workers at headquarters, engineers at maintenance/
supply facilities, members of security guards and fi re
departments on base, and sales staff at welfare/recreational
facilities. They perform functions essential for the smooth
operations of USFJ, and support its activities.
The Government of Japan hires these employees
in accordance with the provisions of the SOFA. The
MOD supports the stationing of USFJ by performing
administrative work for personnel management, payment
of wages, health care, and welfare, etc.

4 Host Nation Support (HNS)

Host Nation Support (HNS) plays an important role to
ensure the smooth and effective implementation of the
Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements. Due to soaring prices
and wages in Japan since the mid-1970s, and changes in
the international economic situation, the Government of
Japan began to bear labor costs such as welfare costs in
FY1978. Then in FY1979, Japan began to bear costs for
the Facilities Improvement Program (FIP).
Furthermore, as labor costs soared due to changes
in economic conditions that affected both countries, the
employment stability of the employees was adversely
infl uenced, and there was even concern that it would
affect the activities of USFJ. Therefore, in 1987, the
Governments of Japan and the United States concluded
an agreement that sets forth special measures regarding
Article 24 of the SOFA (the Special Measures Agreement)[4]
as exceptional, limited and provisional measures under
the cost principle in the SOFA.
Based on this agreement, the Government of Japan


3 Costs Associated with the U.S. Forces Stationed
in Japan


Various costs associated with USFJ include the costs of
stationing USFJ, costs for implementing the stipulations of
the Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) Final
Report for mitigating the impact on the people of Okinawa, as
well as costs for implementing measures that will contribute
to mitigating the impact on local communities associated with
the initiatives for the realignment of the U.S. Forces.

Notes: 1. Training relocation costs under the Special Measures Agreement extend either into the cost sharing for the stationing of USFJ or the SACO-related costs and the

realignment-related costs.

2. The SACO-related costs refer to the cost for implementing the contents of the SACO Final Report to reduce the impact on people in Okinawa, while the

realignment-related costs refer to the cost relating to a step to contribute to reducing the impact on local communities as part of the realignment initiatives. Since the
cost-sharing for the stationing of USFJ is Japan’s voluntary effort to bear some costs in light of the importance of ensuring the smooth and effective implementation of the
Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, its nature is different from the SACO-related costs and the realignment-related costs, and is categorized separately.

3. The costs related to the stationing of USFJ include the MOD-related budget, other ministry-related budgets (base subsidy, etc.: ¥38.2 billion, FY2017 Budget) and the

estimated costs of government-owned land provided for use as USFJ facilities (¥164.1 billion, FY2017 Estimated Costs).

started to bear labor costs of eight categories such as the
adjustment allowance (currently replaced by the regional
allowance). As the Special Measures Agreement (SMA)
was revised later on, the costs borne by the Government of
Japan expanded to cover labor costs for base pay, etc., and
utilities costs from FY1991. The fi nancial responsibility
of the Japanese Government was further expanded to
cover training relocation costs from FY1996.
The Government of Japan has been reviewing
HNS while paying full attention to its tight fiscal
conditions, and as a result, HNS has been on a steady
decline after peaking out in the FY1999 budget on an
expenditure basis.

5 Current Special Measures Agreement


As the former SMA was effective up until March 2016,
the current SMA was intended to “open discussions
pertaining to future arrangements for an appropriate
level for sharing of the costs of U.S. Forces stationed
in Japan” based on the “2+2” agreement of April 2015.
Following this agreement, Japan and the United States
held consultations on a new SMA, and in December 2015,
the Governments of Japan and the United States reached
agreement as follows: Subsequently, after the new SMA
was signed in January 2016 and approval by the Diet, the
new agreement took effect in April of the same year.
The key points of the new SMA are as follows:
(1) Effective period: Five years (from FY2016 through
FY2020).
(2) Cost sharing: Japan shall bear all or part of the labor
costs, utilities costs, and the costs incurred in training
relocation.
❍ Labor costs
The upper limit of the number of workers at welfare,
recreation, and morale facilities to be funded by Japan
will be reduced from 4,408 to 3,893, while the upper
limit of the number of workers engaged in activities such
as maintenance of assets and administrative works to be
funded by Japan, will be increased from 18,217 to 19,285.
As a result, the upper limit of the number of workers to
be funded by Japan will be increased from the current
22,625 to 23,178. These adjustments will be phased in
over the new SMA period from FY2016 to FY2020.


❍ Utilities costs
Over the new SMA period, the share of utilities costs to
be borne by Japan for each fi scal year is reduced from the
current 72% to 61%, with the upper limit for utilities costs
to be funded by Japan set at approximately 24.9 billion yen.
❍ Costs for Facilities Improvement Program
The amount of costs for the FIP will not fall below 20.6
billion yen in each fi scal year during the new SMA
period. For the period of the previous SMA, any amount
of reductions in the labor costs and the utilities costs was
to be appropriated for an increase in costs for the FIP.
But such appropriation will not be made during the new
SMA period.
(3) Scale of Host Nation Support
The amount of HNS in FY2020, the fi nal fi scal year of
the new SMA period, will be approximately 189.9 billion
yen, with the average amount for each fi scal year during
the same period coming to approximately 189.3 billion
yen (any change in wages based on recommendations
by the National Personnel Authority will be refl ected
appropriately in labor costs for each fi scal year).
(4) Cost-saving efforts: It is clearly stipulated that the
United States will make further efforts to economize
the above-mentioned expenditures.


6 USFJ Facilities and Areas and the Local
Communities


The social conditions surrounding USFJ facilities and
areas have changed signifi cantly, including, for example,
through urbanization over the past several decades. For
USFJ facilities and areas to fully exert their capabilities and
be genuinely accepted by the Japanese people, it is vital
to reduce the impact of the facilities and areas as much as
possible and secure the understanding and cooperation of the
local communities in light of such changes. Japan’s national
land is narrow with limited plains, and there are many cases
where USFJ facilities and areas are located close to urban and
business areas. In such areas, factors including the existence
of those facilities and areas, and the takeoffs and landings
of the U.S. Forces aircraft have considerable impact on the
residents’ living environment and local development. It is
therefore necessary to make efforts to mitigate the impact in
a way that is responsive to the circumstances of each area.

announcement in October 2013 that the deployment of
the F-35B fi ghter to Japan would begin in 2017 as its
fi rst forward deployment outside of the United States. In
January 2017, 10 F-35B fi ghters arrived in Iwakuni Air
Base to replace F/A-18 fi ghters. In November, the AV8B
fi ghters were replaced by six F-35B fi ghters.
As the security environment surrounding Japan
is becoming increasingly severe, the Government of
Japan believes that the deployment of the F-35B, the
most up-to-date and high-performance fi ghter, to Japan
is a manifestation of the iron-clad commitment of the
United States to the Japan-U.S. Alliance, strengthens the
deterrent of the Alliance, and contributes to the security
of Japan and the Asia-Pacifi c region.

As for the realignment of USFJ, “the United States-Japan
Roadmap for Realignment Implementation” (Roadmap)
was set forth in May 2006. Subsequently, the Governments
of Japan and the United States have conducted full-fl edged
bilateral discussions concerning coordination of the plan for
the realignment, in view of factors including the following:
1) The necessity of implementing measures to promptly
and steadily enable the visible mitigation of the impact
on Okinawa; 2) The necessity of coordinating strategic
rebalance to the Asia-Pacifi c region and the realignment
package, which was set out in the U.S. Defense Strategic
Guidance released in January 2012; and 3) The fact that
a reduction in the cost associated with the relocation of
the U.S. Marine Corps to Guam has been demanded by
the U.S. Congress. The achievements thereof have been
announced as part of the Joint Statements of the “2+2”
Meeting and through other means.


(MAGTF)—consisting of command, ground, aviation
and logistics support elements—in Japan, Guam, and
Hawaii, as well as in Australia as a rotational unit. In
addition, the Governments of Japan and the United States
decided to delink both the relocation of U.S. Marine
Corps personnel from Okinawa to Guam and the resulting
land returns south of Kadena Air Base from the progress
on the Futenma Replacement Facility (FRF).


2 Achievements at the “2+2” Meeting
(August 17, 2017)


The two Governments agree that, “in view of maintaining
a robust U.S. Force presence in Japan, the Governments
of Japan and the United States reaffi rmed their
commitments to implement the existing arrangements
for the realignment of USFJ. These arrangements aim
to maintain operational and deterrence capability in an
increasingly severe security environment, while also
mitigating the impact on local communities and enhancing
support from local communities for the presence and
operations of USFJ.”

in 1990 that both sides would proceed with the required
adjustments and procedures for the return of land.
Moreover, it was agreed in 1995 that initiatives would
also be made to resolve the so-called Three Okinawa
Issues,[5] including the return of Naha Port (Naha City).
Subsequently, in response to an unfortunate incident
that occurred in 1995, as well as the refusal of the
then Governor of Okinawa to sign land lease renewal
documents under the Act on Special Measures for
USFJ Land Release, the Government of Japan decided
to devote even greater initiatives towards realignment,
consolidation, and reduction, believing that the impact
should be shared by the whole nation. In order to hold
consultations on issues related to USFJ facilities and areas
in Okinawa, the Government of Japan established the
Okinawa Action Council between the central government
and Okinawa Prefecture, and SACO between Japan and
the United States, and the so-called SACO Final Report
was compiled in 1996.

Reduction of USFJ Facilities and Areas in Okinawa


When Okinawa was returned to Japan in 1972, the
Government of Japan provided 83 facilities and areas
covering approximately 278 km2 for exclusive use by
the U.S. Forces under the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty.
However, their concentration in Okinawa has led to
strong calls for their realignment, consolidation and
reduction on the grounds that they seriously affect the
lives of people in Okinawa Prefecture.
Both countries have continued their initiatives to
realign, consolidate, and reduce USFJ facilities and areas,
centering on those subject to the strong local requests,
and, in relation to the so-called 23 issues, it was agreed

2 Outline of SACO Final Report


The SACO Final Report stipulates the return of land, the
adjustment of training and operational procedures, the
implementation of noise abatement initiatives, and the
improvement of operational procedures regarding the
SOFA, and also refers to the related facilities and areas
covered. The land to be returned based on the SACO
Final Report represents approximately 21% (about
50 km[2]) of USFJ facilities and areas in Okinawa at that
time, exceeding the amount of land returned during
the period between the reversion of Okinawa and the
implementation of the SACO Final Report, which is
roughly 43 km[2].

[See] Reference 28 (The SACO Final Report (tentative translation));

(Facilities and Areas Related to the SACO Final Report); Fig. II4-3-5 (Changes in Number and Area of the USFJ Facilities and
Areas (Exclusive Use) in Okinawa)


Government of Japan exerted its full efforts to achieve
the earliest possible return as a way of contributing to the
mitigation of the impact on Okinawa.
On the day before the return, Prime Minister Abe and
then U.S. Ambassador Kennedy made a Japan-U.S. Joint
Announcement. On the day of the return, a ceremony was
held in Okinawa, which was attended by many offi cials
including Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga, then Defense
Minister Inada, then U.S. Ambassador Kennedy, and
Kunigami Village Mayor Miyagi and Higashi Village
Mayor Iju.
Based on the Act on Special Measures Concerning
Promotion of Effective and Appropriate Use of the Lands
in Okinawa Prefecture Previously Provided for Use by
the Stationed Forces, the MOD took measures to remove
obstacles (such as soil contamination survey, etc.) so that
the landowners, etc. can use returned lands effectively and
appropriately, and transferred the land to the landowners
on December 25, 2017.

The returned land accounts for approximately

Okinawa. The return is the largest one since the reversion
of Okinawa to the mainland, and had been an issue for 20
years since the SACO Final Report in 1996.

of Japan reached an agreement with the U.S. side to make
considerations for the natural environment and to relocate
not all but six helipads, which is the minimum necessary,
and has steadily made progress with the construction work.
Some protesters impeded the expeditious execution
of the construction work for the relocation of the
helipads, through repeated obstruction such as parking
cars and setting up tents in front of the entrance of the
Northern Training Area. Thus, not only the Okinawa
Defense Bureau but also the MOD headquarters and
other regional defense bureaus dispatched personnel to
support the relocation construction work.
Despite such efforts, the continuous obstruction
made it diffi cult to bring in material and equipment by
land, leading to a decision to transport them by helicopter.
However, some of the equipment was too heavy for
civilian helicopters to transport. For this reason, the
Ground Self-Defense Force’s CH-47JA helicopter was
used for their transportation in September 2016. In such
ways, utmost efforts were made towards the achievement
of the early return. As a result, the relocation of the
helipads was completed in December 2016.


(approximately 481 ha with a land area 100 times larger
than Tokyo Dome).
a. Relocation of MCAS Futenma and Mitigation of the
Impact on Okinawa
The relocation of MCAS Futenma holds more signifi cance
than merely moving the facility from one location to
another. Rather, it also contributes greatly to mitigating
the impact on Okinawa. As such, the Government will
work as one to implement this initiative.
(a) Distribution of Functions Offered by MCAS Futenma
MCAS Futenma fulfi lls the following functions
relating to the aviation capabilities of the U.S.
Marine Corps stationed in Okinawa: (1) Operation
of the Osprey and other aircraft; (2) Operation of air
refueling aircraft; and (3) Accepting a large number
of transient aircraft in contingencies. Of these three
functions, only (1) “operation of the Osprey and
other aircraft” will be relocated to Camp Schwab. As
for (2) “operation of air refueling aircraft,” all 15 KC130 air refueling aircraft were relocated to MCAS
Iwakuni (in Iwakuni City, Yamaguchi Prefecture) in
August 2014.
This marked the completion of a task that has
remained unresolved for 18 years since the SACO
Final Report in 1996, enabling a vast majority of
fi xed-wing aircraft located in MCAS Futenma to be
moved outside Okinawa Prefecture. This move also
led to the relocation of approximately 870 USFJ
personnel, civilian employees, and dependents.
Moreover, the function of (3) “accepting a large
number of transient aircraft in contingencies” will
also be transferred to Tsuiki Air Base and Nyutabaru
Air Base.
(b) Landfi ll Area The area required for the land
reclamation to build the FRF is approximately 160
ha, less than one-third of the approximately 481 ha of
MCAS Futenma, and the new facility will be equipped
with a signifi cantly shorter runway at approximately
1,200 m (approximately 1,800 m including the
overruns) compared to the current runway length of
2,740 m at MCAS Futenma.
(c) Flight Routes
Two runways will be constructed in a V-shape, which
enables the fl ight path for both takeoff and landing to
be located over the sea, in line with the requests of
the local community. In MCAS Futenma, fl ight paths
used daily for training and other purposes are located
over residential areas, whereas fl ight paths in the FRF
will be changed to over the sea, thereby reducing
noise and risks.

4 History and Progress of the U.S. Forces
Realignment in Okinawa


Along with the initiatives set forth in the roadmap
related to the realignment of the U.S. Forces, measures
were implemented to alleviate the impact on the local
communities while maintaining the deterrence capabilities.

**(1) Relocation and Return of MCAS Futenma**
The Government of Japan believes that it is imperative
not to allow MCAS Futenma to remain indefi nitely at
its current location, which is in the vicinity of houses
and schools in the center of Ginowan City, Okinawa
Prefecture. This is a fundamental idea shared between the
Government of Japan and the people of Okinawa.
As for the relocation of MCAS Futenma, the
Government of Japan has not changed its stance that
the current plan to construct the FRF at the Camp
Schwab Henokosaki area (Nago City) and adjacent
waters is the only solution to avoid the continued use of
MCAS Futenma.
The Government of Japan plans to make further
efforts to achieve the relocation and return of MCAS
Futenma as early as possible and to mitigate the impact
on Okinawa in a speedy manner. The return of MCAS
Futenma is expected to eliminate danger in the area
and to contribute to the further growth of Okinawa,
i l di Gi Cit th h th f th

are located in areas requiring housing noise insulation
near MCAS Futenma, there will be zero households
requiring such insulation around the FRF. This means
that the noise levels experienced by all households
will comply with the environment criteria applied to
exclusive housing areas. In the case that an aircraft
encounters any contingency, safety on the ground can
be ensured by diverting the aircraft offshore.
b. The Necessity of Constructing the Futenma
Replacement Facility within Okinawa Prefecture
The U.S. Marine Corps in Okinawa consists of air,
ground, logistics, and command elements. The interaction
of those elements is indispensable for U.S. Marine Corps
operations characterized by great mobility and readiness,
so it has been determined that the FRF needs to be
located within Okinawa Prefecture so that rotary-wing
aircraft stationed at MCAS Futenma will be located near
the elements with which they train, operate, or otherwise
work on a regular basis.
c. Background Concerning the Futenma Replacement Facility
Considering the occurrence of the U.S. Forces helicopter
crash in Ginowan City in August 2004, bilateral
discussions on the realignment have been made towards
realizing the relocation and return of MCAS Futenma at
the earliest possible date in order to resolve the concern
of the residents living in the vicinity.
In the SCC (“2+2”) document compiled in October
2005, the initiative to “locate the FRF in an ‘L’-shaped
confi guration that combines the shoreline areas of Camp
Schwab and adjacent water areas of Oura Bay” was
approved. However, since this L-shape meant that U.S.
military aircraft would fl y over settlements in Nago City
and Ginoza Village, a request was submitted to avoid
fl ights over these settlements. In light of this, based on
negotiation and agreement with the local municipalities
including Nago City, it was decided to stipulate in
the Roadmap that the FRF be located in a V-shape
confi guration that “combines Henokosaki and adjacent
water areas of Oura and Henoko Bays.” With regard to
construction of this replacement facility, “a Memorandum
of Basic Understanding” was exchanged between the
Governor of Okinawa Prefecture Inamine and the then
Minister of State for Defense Nukaga in May 2006.
After the change of government in September 2009,
the Exploratory Committee for Okinawa Base Issues was
established. After reviews conducted by the Committee,
both governments, at the “2+2” Meeting held in May
2010, confi rmed the intention to locate the FRF in the
Camp Schwab Henokosaki area and the adjacent waters,
and also agreed to take concrete measures to mitigate the
i t Oki


Subsequently, at the 2+2 Meeting held in June
2011, it was decided that the runway would take a “V”
shape, and the Ministers confirmed their commitment
to complete the relocation project at the earliest
possible date after 2014 in order to avoid the indefinite
use of MCAS Futenma and to remove the risks as early
as possible.
During the deliberation process which led to these
conclusions, fi rst of all, it was determined that, from a
security perspective, the deterrence of the U.S. Forces,
including that of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in
Okinawa that is located in a crucial area for the security of
Japan, cannot be lessened while there remains instability
and uncertainty in the security environment in East Asia.
Furthermore, concern was expressed that the functions
of the U.S. Marine Corps such as mobility and readiness
would be weakened if the helicopter units stationed
at MCAS Futenma were to be detached from the other
Marine units stationed in Okinawa and moved abroad or
out of the prefecture. Therefore, it was concluded that the
FRF had to be located within Okinawa Prefecture.
At the “2+2” Meetings in October 2013 and April
2015, which followed the “2+2” Meeting of April
2012, and the joint statement issued at the fi rst JapanU.S. Summit Meeting during the Trump administration
in February 2017, the Governments of Japan and the
United States also confi rmed that the plan to construct
the FRF at Camp Schwab Henokosaki area and adjacent
waters is the only solution that avoids the continued use
of MCAS Futenma.

d. Completion of Environmental Impact Assessment
Procedures
After the MOD sent the environmental impact assessment
scoping document in 2007 to the Governor of Okinawa
Prefecture and other parties, the MOD worked on revising
the document based on the opinions provided by the
governor. Finally, the MOD completed the environmental
impact assessment procedures by sending the revised
assessment document to related parties including the
governor in December 2012, while making the assessment
document available for public review. Throughout these
procedures, the MOD received a total of 1,561 opinions
from the Governor of Okinawa Prefecture on six
occasions, made all the required revisions, and refl ected
them in the content of the environmental assessment.
In this way, the MOD had taken steps to comply with

e. Promotion of the Futenma Replacement facility
Construction Project
The Director General of the Okinawa Defense Bureau
submitted the land-fi ll permit request on public waters to
Okinawa Prefecture in March 2013, and then Governor
of Okinawa Nakaima approved this in December 2013.
However, Governor of Okinawa Onaga revoked the landfi ll permit by then Governor of Okinawa Nakaima in
October 2015, leading to the fi ling of three suits over the
revocation of the land-fi ll permit between the Government
of Japan and Okinawa Prefecture.
Under these circumstances, the court came up with
a settlement recommendation, and the Government of
Japan and Okinawa Prefecture reached a court-mediated
settlement agreement in March 2016. In the settlement,
the Government of Japan and Okinawa mutually affi rmed
that after the fi nal judicial ruling is handed down by the
Supreme Court, they would abide by the ruling and take
steps in line with the spirit of the text of the ruling and
the reasons conducive to the text, and continue to take
responses in good faith by cooperating with each other in
accordance with the purpose of the ruling.[6]

Pursuant to the provisions of the settlement


agreement, the Director General of the Okinawa Defense
Bureau immediately suspended the land-fi ll work while
the Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and
Tourism issued an instruction for correction based on the
Local Autonomy Act to current Governor Onaga to repeal
the revocation of the land-fi ll permit. Subsequently, in
December 2016, after examination by the Central and
Local Government Dispute Management Council and
deliberation by the Fukuoka High Court Naha Branch, the
Supreme Court set forth the decision that the revocation
of the land-fi ll permit by Governor Onaga was illegal.
In the judgment, the Supreme Court ruled that then
Governor Nakaima’s decision was not illegal. The court
stated that no circumstances could be found indicating
that then Governor Nakaima’s decision that the landfi ll
was in compliance with the condition in Article 4
(1) (i) of the Act on Reclamation of Publicly-owned
Water Surface, “that it is appropriate and reasonable
as the use of national land,” had no foundation in fact,
or clearly lacked reasoning under socially accepted
conventions. The reasons given by the court include:
(1) the area of the replacement facilities and the landfi ll
area will be signifi cantly reduced from the area of the
MCAS Futenma facilities, and (2) aircraft fl ying over
residential areas can be avoided by the land-fi ll in the


(1) The suit, fi led by the Government of Japan as plaintiff based on Article 245-8 of the Local Autonomy Act, seeking a court ruling instructing a retraction of the revocation of the land-fi ll permit by
current Governor Onaga (the so-called subrogation suit); (2) the suit, fi led by Okinawa Prefecture based on Article 251-5 of the Local Autonomy Act, seeking to invalidate the decision to suspend the
validity of the revocation of the land-fi ll permit (the decision to suspend execution) by the Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism as the illegal “involvement of the state”; and (3) the
suit, fi led by Okinawa Prefecture based on Article 3 of the Administrative Case Litigation Act, seeking to invalidate the decision to suspend execution by the Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport

a. Timing and Size of Relocation
The 2006 Roadmap stated that approximately 8,000
personnel of the III Marine Expeditionary Force (III
MEF) and approximately 9,000 dependents will be
relocated from Okinawa to Guam by 2014, but the “2+2”
Meeting in June 2011 and other agreements set the timing
of the relocation for the earliest possible date after 2014.
Subsequently, at the “2+2” Meeting held in April
2012, the Governments of Japan and the United States
decided to delink both the relocation of III MEF
personnel from Okinawa to Guam and the resulting land
return south of Kadena Air Base from the progress on
the FRF and the United States reviewed the composition
of the units and the number of personnel to be relocated
to Guam. As a result, Marine Air-Ground Task Force
(MAGTF) is to be stationed and deployed in Guam,
Japan, and Hawaii, approximately 9,000 personnel are to
be relocated to locations outside of Japan (about 4,000
of whom are to be relocated to Guam), the authorized
strength of the U.S. Marine Corps forces in Guam is to
be approximately 5,000 personnel, and the end-state for
the presence of the U.S. Marine Corps in Okinawa is
to be consistent with the level of approximately 10,000
personnel envisioned in the Roadmap.
Accordingly, the “2+2” Meeting held in October
2013 agreed that, under the relocation plan described at
the 2012 “2+2” Meeting, the relocation of U.S. Marine
Corps units from Okinawa to Guam is to begin in the
fi rst half of the 2020s. The plan is expected to promote
the implementation of the consolidation plan for facilities
and areas in Okinawa of April 2013.
b. Costs of the Relocation
Under the Roadmap, the two sides reached an
agreement that, of the estimated US$10.27 billion (in
U.S. fi scal year 2008 dollars) cost of the facilities and
infrastructure development costs, Japan would provide
US$6.09 billion, including US$2.8 billion in direct
cash contribution, while the United States would fund
the remaining US$4.18 billion. In February 2009, the
Japanese Government and the U.S. Government signed
“the Agreement Between the Government of Japan
and the Government of the United States of America
Concerning the Implementation of the Relocation of the
III MEF Personnel and Their Dependents from Okinawa
to Guam” (the Guam International Agreement). The
Agreement legally guarantees and ensures actions taken
by Japan and the United States, such as Japan’s longterm funding for projects to which Japan provides direct
cash contributions. As part of measures based on this
Agreement, the Japanese Government has been providing
h t ib ti t th U S G t i l ti


coastal area that puts the runway extension out to the
sea, and the replacement facilities will be installed
using part of Camp Schwab, which is already provided
to the U.S. Forces.
Moreover, regarding whether the construction of
replacement facilities takes environmental protection and
other considerations into adequate account, the Supreme
Court, fi nding that construction methods, environmental
protection measures and countermeasures that can
conceivably be taken at this point in time have been taken
and that there is suffi cient consideration for disaster
prevention, determined that it cannot be said that then
Governor Nakaima’s decision was illegal. The court did
not fi nd that there was anything particularly unreasonable
in then Governor Nakaima’s decision-making process
and the content of the decision that the construction
met the condition of Article 4 (1) (ii) of the Act on
Reclamation of Publicly-owned Water Surface, “the
land-fi ll gives suffi cient consideration to the protection of
the environment and prevention of disasters.”
Following this Supreme Court ruling, on December
26, Governor Onaga retracted the revocation of the landfi ll
permit and the Okinawa Defense Bureau resumed the
replacement facilities construction project the following
day. On April 25, 2017, it started the construction of the
seawall, the main part of the public waters reclamation.
On July 24 of the same year, Okinawa Prefecture fi led suit
in the Naha District Court, requesting that this seawall
construction not be allowed to damage the reefs on the
seafl oor, etc., without permission from the Governor
of Okinawa based on the laws of Okinawa Prefecture.
Subsequently, that Court dismissed Okinawa Prefecture’s
claim on March 31, 2018, and on July 23, Okinawa
Prefecture objected to that decision, and fi led an appeal
with the Fukuoka High Court Naha Branch.
The Government of Japan views that both the national
government and Okinawa Prefecture will cooperate with
each other and act in good faith, according to the purpose
of the ruling of the Supreme Court and the settlement to
which the two parties agreed. The Government intends to
go forward with the project, while being fully mindful of
the safety of the work and taking the natural environment
and the living environment of the residents into utmost
consideration based on the relevant laws and regulations.

**(2) Force Reduction and Relocation to Guam**
Since the Roadmap was announced in May 2006, the
Governments of Japan and the United States held a series
of consultations on the reduction of the U.S. Forces in
Okinawa.

to the projects for which Japan has provided fi nancial
support since FY2009.[7]

Subsequently, at the “2+2” Meeting held in April
2012, the unit composition and the number of personnel
to be relocated to Guam were revised and it was agreed
that the preliminary cost estimate by the U.S. Government
for the relocation was US$8.6 billion (in U.S. fi scal
year 2012 dollars). With regard to Japan’s fi nancial
commitment, it was reaffi rmed that it was to be the direct
cash contribution of up to US$2.8 billion (in U.S. fi scal
year 2008 dollars) as stipulated in Article 1 of the Guam
International Agreement.[8] It was also confi rmed that
Japan’s equity investment and loans for family housing
projects and infrastructure projects would not be utilized.
Moreover, it was stipulated that any funds that had already
been provided to the U.S. Government under the Guam
International Agreement would be counted as part of the
Japanese contribution. Furthermore, as a new initiative, a
portion of the direct cash contribution of US$2.8 billion
mentioned above would be used to develop training areas
in Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
Islands as shared use facilities for Japan and the United
States. In addition, it was agreed that the remaining costs
and any additional costs would be borne by the United
States, and that the two governments were to complete a
bilateral cost breakdown.
At the “2+2” Meeting in October 2013, a Protocol
Amending the Guam International Agreement was signed
to add the stipulations concerning the development of
training areas in Guam and the Commonwealth of the
Northern Mariana Islands, and the use of these training
areas by the SDF. The limit on Japanese cash contributions
remains unchanged at US$2.8 billion (in U.S. fi scal year
2008 dollars). Both countries also completed the process of
creating a detailed breakdown of required costs. Furthermore,
the National Defense Authorization Act for U.S. Fiscal Year
2015 was enacted in December 2014, which lifted the freeze
on the use of funds for the relocation to Guam imposed by
the U.S. Congress in U.S. Fiscal Year 2012.
c. Completion of Environmental Impact Assessment
Procedures
As for the environmental impact assessment for Guam,
the required procedures were conducted to refl ect the
revisions to the project made by the adjustments to the
plan for realignment, and the assessment was completed
in August 2015.
Furthermore, the Commonwealth of the Northern


Mariana Islands Joint Military Training Environmental
Impact Statement (CJMT-EIS), is now being implemented.
d. Progress of the Guam Relocation Project
While the environmental impact assessment for Guam
was being conducted, the Government of the United States
implemented infrastructure development projects at the
Andersen Air Force Base and the Apra area of the Naval
Base Guam as projects unaffected by the assessment. The
U.S. Government is currently implementing relocation
construction work in all project areas, following the lifting
of the freeze on the Guam relocation funds pursuant to the
National Defense Authorization Act and the completion
of the environmental impact assessment for Guam.

**(3) Return of Land Areas South of Kadena Air base**
The Roadmap stated that following the relocation to the
FRF, the return of MCAS Futenma, and the transfer of
III MEF personnel to Guam, the remaining facilities and
areas on Okinawa will be consolidated, thereby enabling
the return of signifi cant land areas south of Kadena Air
Base. However, at the “2+2” Meeting in April 2012, it
was decided to delink the progress on the FRF from both
the relocation of the III MEF personnel from Okinawa
to Guam and the resulting land returns south of Kadena.
In addition, with regard to the land to be returned, it
was agreed to conduct consultations focusing on three
categories, namely (1) land eligible for immediate
return; (2) land eligible for return once the relocation of
functions is completed; and (3) land eligible for return
after the relocation abroad.
Since the change of administration at the end of 2012,
Japan and the United States have continued consultation
under the basic policy of the Abe administration to dedicate
all its strength to mitigate the impact of the U.S. Forces
on Okinawa communities. Japan strongly requested an
early return of land areas south of Kadena, including
Makiminato Service Area (Camp Kinser) in Urasoe City
of which Okinawa has particularly made a strong request
for the return. As a result, both countries announced the
Consolidation Plan for Facilities and Areas in Okinawa
(Consolidation Plan) in April 2013, which stipulated the
return schedule, including the specifi c years of return.
The return of all land according to the plan will enable
the return of approximately 70% (approximately 1,048 ha,
the equivalent of 220 Tokyo Domes) of USFJ facilities and
areas located in densely populated areas in the central and


As for projects for which Japan provides fi nancial support, cash contributions of approximately 124.2 billion yen have been provided to the U.S. side using the budgets from FY2009 to FY2016.

In line with this, the special provisions for the operations of the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (investment and loan) that had been prescribed by the Act on Special Measures on Smooth

southern parts of the main island of Okinawa.
In the consolidation plan, both sides confi rmed that
they would implement the plan as early as possible. The
Government of Japan will continue to work with all its
strength so that land areas south of Kadena would be
returned at the earliest possible date.
Furthermore, following the announcement of the
consolidation plan, consultations have been held since
April 2013, involving Ginowan City, Ginowan City
Military Land Owners Association, Okinawa Prefecture,
Okinawa Defense Bureau, and Okinawa General Bureau
in a bid to contribute to the promotion of the effective and
appropriate use of West Futenma Housing Area within
Camp Zukeran, and the MOD has also been providing
necessary cooperation.[9]

Efforts have been made to enable the early return of


land areas, including the land areas that are to be returned
as soon as required procedures are completed (shown
in red in Fig. II-4-3-8), since the announcement of the
consolidation plan in April 2013. These efforts resulted
in the realization of the return of the north entrance of
Makiminato Service Area (approximately 1 ha) in August
2013 and West Futenma Housing Area within Camp
Zukeran (approximately 51 ha) at the end of March 2015.
Furthermore, such measures as relocation to Kadena
Ammunition Storage Area and Torii Communication
Station have been implemented to advance the land
return. Additionally, in December 2015, Japan and the
U.S. agreed to such measures as the early return of partial
land at MCAS Futenma for a municipal road, and the
early return of partial land at Makiminato Service Area
for the purpose of widening National Road to relieve

Commentary Land return and site utilization in Okinawa **COLUMN**

The Japanese and U.S. governments have been continuously promoting realignment, consolidation and reduction of U.S. military
facilities and areas in Okinawa prefecture since the return of Okinawa to Japan for the purpose of mitigating the impact of military
bases on Okinawan residents while maintaining Japan’s deterrence capabilities. The two governments accelerated progress in
recent years and there are a number of examples of land utilization after returns that contribute to local vitalization.
Based on the SACO fi nal report, roughly 4,000 ha of the Northern Training Area, a majority of this facility and the largest return
of land since the repatriation of Okinawa, was returned to landowners after a period of just over 70 years from the end of the war in
December 2017. Effective use of the returned land is expected since it became part of the Yanbaru National Park, and a goal is to
register the land as a World Natural Heritage site.
Additionally, the West Futenma Housing Area on Camp Zukeran returned in March 2015 under the Consolidation Plan for
Facilities and Areas in Okinawa was transferred to landowners in March 2018 after obstacle removal work such as soil pollution
surveys for utilization of the land. Plans for this land include use for the Okinawa Health Medical Center, including transfer of the
University of the Ryukyus’ Medical Department and Hospital.
Japan and the United States agreed to the following actions as partial acceleration of the Consolidation Plan in December 2015
– 1) joint use of a portion of land at Camp Zukeran in order to construct a road that connects Route 58 to the former West Futenma
Housing Area, 2) return of a portion of land at MCAS Futenma , and 3) return of a portion of land at Makiminato Service Area.
This agreement resulted initially in the return of approximately 4 ha of land at MCAS Futenma in July 2017. While the return
came more than 30 years after it was requested by local communities, it is likely to alleviate traffi c congestion in the surrounding
area and improve the local living environment through advances in municipal road development suspended for over a quarter century.
The next step was the return of approximately 3 ha of land at Makiminato Service Area adjacent to Route 58 in March 2018.
While Route 58, which runs alongside Makiminato Service Area, experienced the prefecture’s worst traffi c congestion at more than
70,000 cars a day, it is expected that the completion of the land return will help alleviate traffi c congestion through use of this land
to widen the road from six lanes to eight lanes.
Japanese and U.S. people involved gathered for a ceremony commemorating the above-mentioned return of a portion of land at
Makiminato Service Area and transfer of the West Futenma Housing Area on May 20, 2018, including Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga,
Minister of State for Okinawa and Northern Territories Affairs Fukui, State Minister of Defense Yamamoto, Vice Governor of Okinawa
Jahana, Ginowan Mayor Sakima, Urasoe Mayor Matsumoto, and Deputy Commander of the U.S. Forces in Japan. It was confi rmed
that this land return and transfer will lead to realization of effective and appropriate land use.
The Japanese and U.S. governments intend to continue promoting local vitalization through utilization of returned land sites
and advancement of Okinawa as a whole by moving forward with such land returns especially in highly populated areas south of
Kadena Air Base.

Furthermore, the timing and fiscal year in parentheses do not take into account the length of time necessary for relocation to outside of Japan because, though the conditions
for returning the areas include relocation to outside of Japan, its plan is yet to be decided. Consequently, the timing and year may be subject to change according to the
progress of the relocation to outside of Japan.

the landowners, and at the end of March 2018, partial land
at Makiminato Service Area (approximately 3 ha) were
returned to the landowners and West Futenma Housing
Area within Camp Zukeran (approximately 51 ha) was
transferred to the landowners.
All-out initiatives are being continuously made to
steadily implement the return of land areas south of Kadena
Air Base under the consolidation plan and mitigate the
impact on Okinawa as early as possible, and also to realize
the respective returns of land in the shortest possible time
for more visible mitigation of the impact on Okinawa.

5 Osprey Deployment by the U.S. Forces in Japan

**(1) U.S. Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey Deployment in**
**Okinawa**

The Osprey is an aircraft that combines the vertical
takeoff/landing and hovering functions of rotary-wing
aircraft on the one hand and the speed and range of
fi xed-wing aircraft on the other. As the primary air unit
of the U.S. Marine Corps, the MV-22 that has been
developed for the U.S. Marine Corps plays an important
role in engaging in a broad range of activities, including
transportation of personnel and goods.
The U.S. Marine Corps was replacing aged rotarywing aircrafts (CH-46) with MV-22s, which have superior
basic performance. In September 2013, all the 24 CH-46s
deployed at MCAS Futenma were replaced by MV-22s.
The MV-22 is a highly capable aircraft compared
with the CH-46; it can fl y faster, can carry more payload,
and has a longer range. Its deployment to Okinawa will
strengthen the deterrence of USFJ as a whole and greatly
contribute to the peace and stability of the region.


-----

**(2) CV-22 Osprey Deployment by U.S. Air Force to**
**Yokota Air Base**

In May 2015, the Government of the United States
announced that CV-22 aircraft, tailored to meet the
requirements of the U.S. Air Force, would be deployed
to Yokota Air Base (which encompasses Fussa City,
Tachikawa City, Akishima City, Musashi Murayama City,
Hamura City and Mizuho Town of Tokyo Prefecture),
with the fi rst three aircraft to be deployed in the latter half
of 2017 for completion of the deployment of a total of 10
aircraft by 2021. However, the Government of the United
States announced in March 2017 that it would delay the
arrival of the CV-22s to the U.S. fi scal year 2020.
In April 2018, the Government of the United States
announced 5 aircraft were scheduled to be deployed around
the summer of 2018 to address regional security concerns
in the Pacifi c region, adjusting the previously announced
timeline in 2017. The total of 10 aircraft are expected to be
deployed in stages over the next several years.
The CV-22 aircraft to be deployed to Yokota Air Base
will handle tasks for transporting personnel and supplies
for Special Operation Forces of the U.S. Forces to deal
with crises and emergencies in the Asia-Pacifi c region,
including humanitarian assistance and natural disasters.
As Japan faces an increasingly tougher security
environment, the deployment of high-performance CV-22
from the perspective of the U.S. commitment to the AsiaPacifi c region and enhancing the readiness posture of the
United States will enhance the deterrence and response
capabilities of the Japan-U.S. Alliance and contribute to the
defense of Japan and the stability of the Asia-Pacifi c region.
The Government of Japan will continue to take
responses in a careful and sincere manner in order
to obtain the understanding and cooperation of local
communities.

**(3) Safety of the Osprey**
Prior to the deployment of the MV-22s to MCAS
Futenma in 2012, the Government of Japan conducted its
own confi rmation of the aircraft’s safety by establishing
an analysis and assessment team composed of experts
from inside and outside the Government and aircraft
pilots, etc., In addition, when our country itself decided
to introduce Ospreys (V-22s) in 2014, the Government
reconfi rmed the safety of the aircraft by collecting and
analyzing all kinds of technical information.
Regarding recent accidents involving the MV22, there has been no change in the recognition of the
Government of Japan that there is no problem with the
safety of the MV-22 aircraft, as the U.S. side has not given
l ti th t th i t t l bl ith


the aircraft. For example, the cause of the MV-22 mishap
off the coast of Okinawa in December 2016 was pilot
error during the mishap pilot’s attempts to conduct aerial
refueling training under challenging weather conditions.
Additionally, the CV-22 has the same propulsion
system with the MV-22 and the structure of both aircraft
is basically in common; therefore, the Government of
Japan considers the safety of both aircraft to be at the
same level.
In any event, the Government of Japan considers that
ensuring safety is of prime importance in operations of
the U.S. Forces, and on various occasions, including the
Japan-U.S. “2+2” Meeting in August 2017, Minister of
Defense Onodera requested Secretary of Defense Mattis
and other high-ranking offi cials to give consideration to
local communities and ensure safety. The Government of
Japan will continue to ask for the maximum consideration
for safety.

MV22 aircraft, deployed in Okinawa, were dispatched
for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief activities to
support Operation Damayan. The MV-22s were deployed
promptly to affected areas that were diffi cult to access,
and transported several hundred isolated victims and
about six tons of relief materials in a day. In April 2014,
the MV-22, deployed in Okinawa, was dispatched for
search and rescue activities in the wake of an accidental
sinking of a passenger ship off the coast of Jindo in the
Republic of Korea. Furthermore, in response to the large
earthquake that hit Nepal in April 2015, four MV-22s
deployed in Okinawa were dispatched to the country to
transport personnel and supplies.
In Japan, when the Kumamoto Earthquake occurred
in 2016, MV-22s were dispatched to deliver daily
necessities to the disaster stricken areas.
In this manner, the MV-22 is capable of conducting
humanitarian assistance and disaster relief activities
immediately and over a large range when large-scale
disasters occur because of its high performance and
multi-functionality. It has also been used for disaster
prevention drills since 2014. In September 2016, two
MV22s participated in the comprehensive disaster
prevention drills of Sasebo City, Nagasaki Prefecture and
conducted delivery drills for isolated islands.

6 Consultation Structures for Mitigating
the Impact on Okinawa

Today, a number of USFJ facilities and areas still remain
in Okinawa because of the U.S. occupation of Okinawa
and the slower progress of return of USFJ facilities and
areas compared to other areas of Japan even after the
occupation ended. In order to mitigate the concentrated
impact on Okinawa, the Government of Japan has been
implementing initiatives towards the realization of the


-----

SACO Final Report and the Roadmap. The MOD is
committed to further mitigating the impact on Okinawa
through the Okinawa Policy Council, its subcommittee
and other means, while listening to the opinions of the
local residents.[10]

At the Okinawa Policy Council Meeting in December
2013, then Governor of Okinawa Nakaima presented
several requests, including cessation of the operation of
MCAS Futenma within fi ve years and its early return, the
re-deployment of about twelve MV-22s to bases outside
of Okinawa, and the total return of Makiminato Service
Area within seven years.
The Japanese Government as a whole is addressing
the mitigation of the impact on Okinawa by establishing
the Council for Promoting the Mitigation of the Impact
of MCAS Futenma on Okinawa, consisting of the Chief
Cabinet Secretary, the Minister of State for Okinawa, the
Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Defense,
the Governor of Okinawa and the Mayor of Ginowan.
The MOD also created the Committee for Promoting the
Mitigation of the Impact of Bases on Okinawa headed
by the State Minister of Defense in January 2014 to
continually work on the reduction of the impact on
Okinawa.
The Consultation between the Central Government
and Okinawa Prefecture, consisting of the Chief Cabinet
Secretary, the Minister of State for Okinawa, the Minister
for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Defense, the Deputy
Chief Cabinet Secretary (administrative) and the Governor
and Vice Governor of Okinawa, was established with
the purpose of holding consultations on measures for
the mitigation of the impact on Okinawa and measures
for Okinawa’s development. In the three meetings that


have been held since January 2016, discussion took place
on issues such as the relocation of MCAS Futenma and
the suspension of its operation within fi ve years and the
return of more than half of the Northern Training Area.

Facilities and Areas)


7 Initiatives for the Use of Lands Previously
Provided for Use by the Stationed Forces


For the return of lands in Okinawa provided for use by
the USFJ (“USFJ Land”), the Act on Special Measures
Concerning Promotion of Effective and Appropriate Use
of the Lands in Okinawa Prefecture Previously Provided
for Use by the Stationed Forces stipulates various measures
concerning the USFJ Land agreed to be returned. The MOD
mainly conducts the following initiatives, and will continue
its initiatives to promote the effective and appropriate use
of returned lands by coordinating and cooperating with
related ministries, the prefectural government and local
municipalities. The MOD:
(1) conducts mediation in relation to access for surveys,
etc., to be implemented by the prefectural government
and local municipalities on the USFJ Land which are
agreed to be returned;
(2) conducts measures applying to all the returned lands
to remove obstacles for use such as soil contamination
and unexploded ordnance, not only those caused by
the activities of the stationed forces, before handing
over the land to the owners and
(3) provides fi nancial benefi ts to alleviate the impact on
the owners of the returned lands and to promote use
of the land.


5 Stationing of the U.S. Forces in Regions Other than Okinawa


In regions other than Okinawa, the MOD is implementing
measures to secure the stable presence of the U.S. Forces
by maintaining its deterrence and trying to mitigate the
impact on local communities.


on the return of six facilities and areas in Yokohama
City and on the construction of housing units for
dependents of members of the U.S. Forces in the
Yokohama area of the “Ikego Housing Area and
Navy Annex.” Of the area of approximately 419
ha to be returned, approximately 375 ha consisting
of four facilities and areas, including Kami Seya
Communication Station, have to date been returned.

the headquarters of the Ground Component Command.
In addition, for more effective and effi cient use
of Camp Zama and the Sagami General Depot (SGD),
measures were taken for the partial return of respective
facilities and areas. In February 2016, the partial release
of land (approximately 5.4 ha) at Camp Zama was realized
and Zama General Hospital was established on the
returned site in April 2016. In addition, in December 2015,
the shared use of a portion of land at SGD (approximately
35ha) with Sagamihara City was realized. In other areas,
the realignment projects associated with the improvement
of U.S. Army Japan command and control capability have
been undertaken as shown in Fig. II-4-3-11.

**(1) Improvement of U.S. Army Japan Command and**
**Control capability**

To have enhanced mobility and readiness as well as to
enable joint missions, the headquarters of U.S. Army Japan
(USARJ) at Camp Zama (Sagamihara City and Zama City in
Kanagawa Prefecture) was reorganized into the headquarters
of the USARJ&I Corps (Forward) in December 2007 and
the reorganization took place at the end of September 2008.
With the aim of strengthening coordination with the
reorganized USARJ headquarters so as to enable rapid
responses to various contingencies, the GSDF Central
Readiness Force Headquarters (then) was relocated from
GSDF Camp Asaka (Asaka City, Wako City and Niiza
City in Saitama Prefecture and Nerima Ward, Tokyo) to
Camp Zama, where the headquarters of U.S. Army Japan

**(2) Yokota Air Base and Airspace**
a. Commencement of the Operation of the Bilateral
Joint Operations Coordination Center (BJOCC) and the
Relocation of ASDF Air Defense Command HQ
Enhancement of coordination between the headquarters
of both countries, combined with the transition to joint
operational posture, is highly important to ensure a
response with fl exibility and readiness of the SDF and
the U.S. Forces. Therefore, at the end of FY2011, the
Bilateral Joint Operations Coordination Center (BJOCC)
commenced its operations at Yokota Air Base and the
ASDF Air Defense Command HQ and its relevant units
were relocated to Yokota Air Base.[11] These arrangements
have made it possible to enhance coordination between
the headquarters of the SDF and the U.S. Forces,
including the sharing of information concerning air
defense and BMD.
b. Yokota Airspace
To facilitate the operations of civilian airplanes in
Yokota airspace, where the U.S. Forces conduct radar
approach control, measures have been taken since 2006
to temporarily transfer the responsibility for air traffi c
control of portions of Yokota airspace to Japanese
authorities, to deploy ASDF offi cers at the Yokota Radar
Approach Control (Yokota RAPCON), and to reduce
the airspace by about 40% (i.e., the release of air traffi c
control from USFJ).
c. Civilian-Military Dual Use of Yokota Air Base
At the Japan-U.S. Summit Meeting held in May 2003, it
was agreed that the joint civilian-military use of Yokota
Air Base would be studied, and a Liaison Conference
was then established as a working panel attended by
relevant government ministries and agencies and the
Tokyo Metropolitan Government. The Governments
of Japan and the United States are also conducting a
study on the specifi c conditions and modalities, with the
understanding that both countries will not compromise
the military operations and safety of Yokota Air Base.

**(3) Deployment of U.S. Aircraft Carrier to Commander**
**Fleet Activities, Yokosuka**

The presence of the U.S. Pacifi c Fleet plays an important
role in ensuring maritime security in the Asia-Pacifi c
region as well as regional peace and stability. The U.S.
aircraft carrier[12] provides the core capability of the
Fleet. The U.S. Navy affi rms that it will continue to


ensure that all of its forward-deployed nuclear-powered
vessels, including USS Ronald Reagan, while anchored
at Commander Fleet Activities, Yokosuka (Yokosuka
City, Kanagawa Prefecture), adhere to the relevant safety
policies. For example, the nuclear reactor will normally
be shut down while the aircraft carrier is anchored, and
repairing and refueling will not be carried out in Japan.
The Government of Japan intends to continue taking all
possible measures to ensure safety.

**(4) Measures relating to Naval Air Facility Atsugi and**
**MCAS Iwakuni**

a. Relocation of Carrier-Based Aircraft
Naval Air Facility Atsugi (Ayase City, Yamato City and
Ebina City in Kanagawa Prefecture) was used as a base
for carrier-based aircraft. Since Naval Air Facility Atsugi
is located at the center of an urban district, the noise of
carrier jets taking off and landing in particular had been a
problem for a long time. It was necessary to resolve such
problems as soon as possible in order to stably maintain
the operations of aircraft carriers.
Thus, after the completion of the runway relocation
project at MCAS Iwakuni (Iwakuni City, Yamaguchi
Prefecture), which made aircraft operations possible with
less impact on the living environment of the surrounding
communities, it was decided that CVW-5 squadrons
would be relocated from Naval Air Facility Atsugi to
MCAS Iwakuni. The relocation began in August 2017
and completed in March 2018.[13]

As the security environment in the Asia-Pacifi c
region grows increasingly severe, while this relocation
allows the long-term forward deployment of a U.S. aircraft
carrier and carrier-based aircraft, ensuring deterrence, it
also alleviates issues regarding the noise to a signifi cant
extent. This would not have been possible without the
understanding of residents of Yamaguchi Prefecture and
Iwakuni City.
In order to mitigate impacts of the increased
operations at MCAS Iwakuni due to the relocation,
the related measures listed in Fig. II-4-3-13 are to be
taken. As a result, the noise problems are expected to
be mitigated from the current situation, with the area
requiring residential noise-abatement work, or the socalled fi rst category area, decreasing from approximately
1,600 ha to approximately 650 ha.


11 The BJOCC functions to contribute to providing a joint response for Japan’s defense. To that end, it works to enhance information sharing, close coordination, and interoperability between the Japanese
and U.S. headquarters.

12 Nuclear-powered aircraft carriers do not need to replenish their fuel and they are able to maintain the high speeds necessary for the operation of aircraft, giving them excellent combat and operational
capabilities.

VOICE Message from the Iwakuni Mayor (Yamaguchi) **COLUMN**

Iwakuni City is located in the eastern part of Yamaguchi Prefecture facing the Seto Inland Sea and has various regional characteristics
and resources, including magnifi cent mountains, clear streams, a beautiful sea, and historical and cultural resources.
One of such unique features is the presence of MCAS Iwakuni jointly used by the U.S. Marines and Maritime Self-Defense
Force. In accordance with the Realignment Roadmap bilaterally agreed in May 2006, 15 KC-130 air refueling aircraft relocated from
MCAS Futenma in Okinawa. In addition, approximately 60 U.S. Navy carrier-based aircraft relocated from NAF Atsugi in Kanagawa
Prefecture at the end of March 2018. As a result, approximately 120 U.S. military aircraft as well as the U.S. Navy Unit now station
at MCAS Iwakuni.
The City’s comprehensive plan formulated in December 2014 calls for “co-existence with the base.” It outlines measures to
mitigate various impacts attributed to the base, such as aircraft noise and incidents/accidents. At the same time, it outlines measures
for community development, taking advantage of the adjacency to the base, in the fi elds of education, disaster prevention, tourism,
industrial development, and Japan-U.S. exchanges.
We expect to promote exchanges through sports and cultural events at the Atagoyama Sports Facility (baseball fi eld, athletic
stadium, cultural interaction center, etc.) developed by the Ministry of Defense as carrier-based aircraft were relocated.
About 3,800 people (military personnel, civilian personnel, and their dependents) moved from NAF Atsugi along with the
relocation, and the total number of people is more than 10,000 (including those already here). Iwakuni City seeks to deepen
the mutual understanding and friendship between Japan and the U.S. through various opportunities, while maintaining a good
relationship between U.S. personnel and local residents as “good neighbors.”
Iwakuni Kintaikyo Airport, which uses the runway of the U.S. military base, opened in December 2012. The Okinawa route was
established in March 2016 in addition to the Haneda route. The boarding rate since its opening has been 68.0% (as of end of April
2018), which exceeds the expectation and stays high.
Iwakuni has evolved together with the base and has been cooperative for the stable operations of the base.
It is true that we have faced various challenges as a city hosting the base, but I believe that our efforts contribute to
maintenance of the USFJ deterrence capabilities, Japan’s national defense/security policy, and mitigation of the impact on
Okinawa. Iwakuni City will continue to carry out its duty to realize the long-term development of the city as well as to maintain
local residents’ peace and security.

to a variety of situations including large-scale disasters as
well as regular exercises and other activities, including
use by the U.S. Forces as a permanent site for FCLP. In
addition, the 2005 SCC document confi rmed that the
U.S. Forces will continue to conduct FCLP at Iwo-To in

: Implemented : Currently under implementation or scheduled for implementation


**(6) Training Relocation**
a. Aviation Training Relocation (ATR)
Based on the decision that U.S. aircraft from three USFJ
facilities and areas—Kadena, Misawa (Misawa City
and Tohoku Town in Aomori Prefecture) and MCAS
Iwakuni—would participate for the time being in
bilateral training with ASDF at ASDF facilities, training
relocation has been underway since 2007. The MOD has
been improving its infrastructure, as required, for the
training relocation.[15]
In January 2011, at the Joint Committee, based on
the achievements at the “2+2” Meeting in 2010, both
governments agreed to include Guam as a new training
relocation site and to expand the scale of training.
Moreover, at the Joint Committee in October 2011, they
agreed on details for training sites. After that, training was
relocated to Guam and other locations for the fi rst time,
leading to a series of training conducted at relocation sites.

Yamaguchi Prefecture and Iwakuni City, had been
working together to request the resumption of civil
aviation operations, it was agreed in the Roadmap
that “portions of the future civilian air facility will
be accommodated at MCAS Iwakuni.” Based on this
agreement, Iwakuni Kintaikyo Airport was opened in
December 2012, resuming regular fl ights of civil aviation
aircraft for the fi rst time in 48 years.

**(5) Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD)**
Japan and the United States are set to continue close
coordination on BMD as the two countries improve their
respective BMD capabilities. In June 2006, an AN/TPY-2
radar (so-called “X-Band Radar”) system was deployed
to the U.S. Shariki Communication Site (Tsugaru City,
Aomori Prefecture).[14] Also in October 2006, U.S. Army
Patriot PAC-3 units (Patriot Advanced Capability) were
deployed to Kadena Air Base (Kadena Town, Okinawa
City and Chatan Town in Okinawa Prefecture) and
Kadena Ammunition Storage Area (Yomitan Village,
Okinawa City, Kadena Town, Onna Village and Uruma
City in Okinawa Prefecture). In December 2014, the
second TPY-2 radar in Japan was deployed to the U.S.
Kyogamisaki Communication Site (Kyotango City in
Kyoto Prefecture).
In addition, the United States deployed Aegis
destroyers with BMD capabilities to Commander Fleet
Activities, Yokosuka (Yokosuka City in Kanagawa
Prefecture) in October 2015 and March 2016. Another
Aegis destroyer with BMD capabilities, USS Milius, was
also added to the fl eet in May 2018. [P]

[See] Part III, Chapter 1, Section 2-3 (Response to Ballistic Missiles, etc.)


14 The radar was deployed to ASDF Shariki Sub Base (in Aomori Prefecture) in June 2006, but was thereafter transferred to the neighboring U.S. Shariki Communication Site.


-----

Furthermore, in March 2014, both governments at
the Joint Committee agreed to add air-to-ground training
using the Misawa Air-to-Ground Range (Misawa City and
Rokkasho Village in Aomori Prefecture). This agreement
resulted in air-to-ground training using the Misawa Airto-Ground Range in June 2014.
The training relocation contributes to enhancing
interoperability between the two countries, and also to
relocating part of air-to-ground training conducted by
using Kadena Air Base. Thus, this training relocation will
help noise abatement around Kadena Air Base, thereby
contributing to the mitigation of the impact on Okinawa.
In addition to assisting USFJ, the MOD/SDF is
conducting efforts to ensure the safety and security
of the local community, such as the establishment of a
liaison offi ce, facilitating communication with related
government agencies, and response to requirements from
the local community. These efforts have been contributing
to successful training relocation.
b. Relocation of Training for MV-22, etc.
Having decided in the “2+2” joint statement of October
3, 2013 to reduce the MV-22’s amount of time located
and training in Okinawa and to utilize opportunities to
participate in various operations in mainland Japan and
across the region in order to increase training outside


of Okinawa Prefecture, including mainland Japan,
while maintaining the deterrent of the Alliance, the
Governments of Japan and the United States have been
moving forward with the implementation of training,
etc. for the MV-22 at MCAS Futenma outside of
Okinawa Prefecture.
On September 1, 2016, it was agreed at the Japan-U.S.
Joint Committee to relocate the training activities of TiltRotar / Rotary wing aircraft, such as the AH-1 and CH53,
and the MV-22 that are currently stationed at MCAS
Futenma out of Okinawa Prefecture at Japan’s expense in
order to further promote training outside of Okinawa and
mitigate the impact of training activities on Okinawa.
Three training relocation programs were scheduled
for FY2017. The training was held in Hokkaido in
August 2017, in Kumamoto Prefecture in December, and
in Miyagi Prefecture between February and March 2018
as Japan-U.S. joint training (fi eld training between the
GSDF and the U.S. Marine Corps).
The MV-22’s amount of time located and training
in Okinawa will continue to be reduced by relocating
exercises participated by the MV-22 to places such as
mainland Japan and Guam, and the Government will
continue to promote initiatives that contribute to further
mitigating the impact on Okinawa.


6 Initiatives for Smooth Implementation of the Realignment of the U.S. Forces in Japan


In order to smoothly implement the realignment of USFJ
based on the Roadmap, the Act on Special Measures on
Smooth Implementation of the Realignment of United
States Forces in Japan (USFJ Realignment Special
Measures Act) was enacted in August 2007. Realignment
grants, Special Subsidy Rates for Public Projects, etc.
and other systems were established based on the law.
During a period of time before and after the
implementation of realignment (10 years in principle),[16]
realignment grants will be awarded to help cover the
expenses of projects[17] which contribute to increasing the
convenience of the lives of residents of local municipalities
affected by the realignment,[18] and to stimulate local
industries. To this end, they will be awarded in accordance
with progress made in the steps of U.S. Forces realignment,
after the Defense Minister designates the specifi ed defense
facilities and neighboring municipalities affected by


realignment. As of April 2018, 9 defense facilities in 15
municipalities are eligible to receive the grant.
In addition, under the U.S. Forces realignment, some
USFJ facilities and areas will be returned, and the U.S.
Marine Corps in Okinawa will be relocated to Guam.
Since these developments may affect the employment
of USFJ local employees, the Government of Japan will
take measures to include education and skills training,
which is to help retain their employment.
The Realignment Special Measures Act was
supposed to cease to be effective as of March 31, 2017.
However, since there remain realignment projects that
require implementation, an act revising part of the Act
including a ten-year extension of the time limit of the Act
to March 31, 2027 was enacted.

7 Measures to Mitigate the Impacts of USFJ Facilities and Areas


2 Ensuring Safety of Operations of USFJ

Ensuring the safety of local residents is of prime
importance in USFJ operations, and an accident or
incident must not occur. Both Japan and the U.S.
cooperate with a prime focus on ensuring the safety.
Despite such circumstances, a CH-53E helicopter
assigned to MCAS Futenma made an emergency landing
at Higashi Village in Kunigami District and burned into
fl ames in October 2017, and a window of another CH53E assigned to MCAS Futenma fell onto the playground
of Futenma Daini Elementary School in December 2017.
Then in 2018, an F-16 fi ghter assigned to Misawa Air
Base jettisoned fuel tanks in Lake Ogawara in February,
and there have been precautionary and emergency
landings on civilian airports, etc.
Regarding these accidents and incidents, Japan
has clearly conveyed its position to the U.S. side and
requested preventive measures to avoid reoccurrence
especially at summit and ministerial levels, in light of
anxieties and concerns of local communities.
Causes of these accidents and incidents may vary
depending on the case, but the Government of Japan has
determined the rationality of results of investigations and
preventive measures on the U.S. side through not only
hearing explanations from the U.S. side but also confi rming
with SDF expertise. Additionally, the MOD has strongly
requested the U.S. side to provide information regarding
the accidents and incidents, and taken appropriate steps,
including explaining to the local authorities in a timely
manner, when the relevant information was provided by
the U.S. side.


1 Initiatives to Conserve the Environments around
USFJ Facilities and Areas

At the “2+2” Meeting in September 2000, based on the
recognition that environmental conservation is important,
the governments of both nations agreed to make it a
common objective to ensure the health and safety of
residents in the vicinity of USFJ facilities and areas,
U.S. Forces personnel, their families and other such
parties, and made the “Joint Statement of Environmental
Principles.”[19] To follow up on this announcement, JapanU.S. consultations have been enhanced. Specifi cally, the
MOD has been working with relevant ministries and
agencies to enhance cooperation for regular reviews of
the Japan Environmental Governing Standards (JEGS),[20]
exchange information on the environment, and deal with
environmental pollution.
Additionally, at the “2+2” Meeting in May 2010,
Japan and the United States discussed the possibility
of taking a “Green Alliance” approach and studied the
adoption of renewable energy for the U.S. Forces facilities
and areas under development in Japan.
Furthermore, the Governments of Japan and the
United States engaged in discussions aimed at the creation
of a framework for increased initiatives in managing the
environment associated with USFJ facilities and areas.
The Government of Japan then commenced negotiations
with the United States on an agreement that supplements
the SOFA on an environmental front, and they reached
substantive accord in October 2014, before signing and
effectuating the supplementary agreement in September
2015. This supplemental agreement represents an
international commitment with legal binding force and
sets forth provisions concerning environmental standards
and access to USFJ facilities and areas.
This supplemental agreement is part of a more
comprehensive framework for recognizing the
signifi cance of environmental protection. This agreement
is the fi rst one to be created to supplement the SOFA
since the SOFA entered into force and has a historical
signifi cance that differs in nature from conventional
improvements in the operations of the SOFA.


3 Other Measures


The Government of Japan has been taking measures for
the improvement of the living environment in regions
surrounding USFJ facilities and areas. The Ministry
of Internal Affairs and Communications also provides
municipalities with base grants, which have alternate
features in terms of municipal tax on real estate.
Moreover, in the vicinity of USFJ facilities and areas,
incidents and accidents caused by U.S. Forces personnel
and others have affected local areas and their residents,
so the Government of Japan has requested USFJ to take
effective measures for the prevention of recurrence, such

Commentary Exchanges between Local Residents and the U.S. Forces **COLUMN**

For the stationing of the U.S. Forces in Japan (USFJ), it is imperative to gain understanding and cooperation from citizens who live
near USFJ facilities and areas.
The Ministry of Defense (MOD) has been arranging the Japan-U.S. friendship programs through sports, music, culture, and other
events for residents living near USFJ facilities and areas, and USFJ-related personnel based on the understanding and cooperation
of local residents and the USFJ as an initiative to deepen Japan-U.S. mutual understanding. In addition, the USFJ conducts various
exchange programs in collaboration with the local communities.
For example, the MOD arranged a “scarecrow-making activity” in FY2017 as a new initiative for elementary school students
living near Shariki Communications Site (Tsugaru City, Aomori) and military personnel working at the site where TPY-2 radar (X-band
radar) is deployed to improve BMD capabilities. The USFJ also interacted with the community by attending the graduation ceremony
of elementary school.
The MOD held the Japanese-American Friendship Music Festival with local residents and military personnel at Kyogamisaki
Communications Site (Kyotango City, Kyoto) where the same radar has been deployed since 2014 as a new initiative. The USFJ also
interacted with local residents through English conversation lessons.
The MOD believes that maintaining these exchanges over the years would foster trust relationships between local residents and
the USFJ, and will continue to host Japan-U.S. friendship programs with the understanding and cooperation of local residents and
the USFJ.

as educating military personnel and others, and enforcing
strict discipline among them. The Government of Japan
is cooperating with USFJ in these prevention measures;
at the same time it has taken measures for prompt and
appropriate compensation for the damage caused by the
incidents and accidents.
The United States has also taken measures for its
part, putting in place its guidelines for off-duty action
(liberty policy), including measures such as nighttime
alcohol restrictions as well as curfews applying to U.S.
Forces personnel ranked below a certain rank.
Following the case which occurred in Okinawa in
April 2016 where a member of the U.S. Forces civilian
component became a suspect of murder, the Governments
of Japan and the United States engaged in discussions
to develop effective prevention measures, and released
the Japan-United States Joint Statement in July 2016 on
clarifying the scope of the civilian component, among
other matters.[21]

The Governments of Japan and the United States


conducted intensive discussions to establish a legally
binding document based on the joint statement, and
in January 2017 signed the Agreement between the
Government of Japan and the Government of the
United States of America on Cooperation with regard
to Implementation Practices Relating to the Civilian
Component of United States Armed Forces in Japan,
Supplementary to the Agreement under Article VI of
the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between
Japan and the United States of America, Regarding
Facilities and Areas and the Status of United States Armed
Forces in Japan, which immediately went into force. This
supplementary agreement supplements and clarifi es the
content of the “civilian component” prescribed by the
SOFA and it is the second such supplementary agreement,
following the Supplementary Agreement on Cooperation
in the Field of Environmental Stewardship, which was
concluded in 2015. It is hoped that the recurrence of
incidents and accidents by the civilian component of
USFJ will be prevented by further promoting cooperation

the Directors-General of each Bureau within the Internal
Bureaus shall, along with the Commissioner of ATLA who
is in charge of defense equipment administration, support
the Minister of Defense in accordance with their respective
responsibilities, by providing the Minister of Defense
assistance from a policy perspective – namely, to ensure that
the affairs under the jurisdiction of the MOD are properly
carried out in accordance with laws and regulations in order
to accomplish the mission of the MOD. The Joint Staff is
a staff organization for the Minister of Defense concerning
the operation of the SDF. The Chief of Joint Staff provides
centralized support for the operations of the SDF for the
Minister of Defense from a military expert’s perspective.
The Ground Staff, Maritime Staff and Air Staff are the
staff organizations for the Minister of Defense concerning
their respective services except operations of the SDF,
with the Chiefs of Staff for the Ground Self-Defense Force
(GSDF), the Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) and the
Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF) acting as the top ranking
expert advisers to the Minister of Defense regarding
these services. In this manner, the MOD has ensured that
the support for the Minister from a policy perspective
and the support for the Minister from a military expert’s
perspective shall be provided in a well-balanced manner
like the two wheels of a vehicle, so to speak, in order for
the Minister of Defense to appropriately make decisions.
This existing concept regarding the support system for the

2 Systems to Support the Minister of Defense


The Minister of Defense is responsible for issues related
to the defense of Japan as the head of the MOD, and is
in overall charge of the SDF duties in accordance with
the provisions of the SDF Law. The Minister is supported
by the State Minister of Defense, the Parliamentary ViceMinisters of Defense (two) and the Senior Adviser to the
Minister of Defense. There are also the Special Advisers
to the Minister of Defense, who advise the Minister of
Defense, and the Defense Council, which deliberates on
basic principles concerning administrative affairs under
the Ministry’s jurisdiction. Furthermore, there are the
Administrative Vice-Minister of Defense, who organizes
and supervises the administrative affairs of each bureau
and organization to support the Minister of Defense, and
the Vice-Minister of Defense for International Affairs,
who is responsible for the overall coordination of duties
such as those related to international affairs.
Moreover, the Internal Bureaus of the MOD, Joint
Staff, Ground Staff Offi ce, Maritime Staff Offi ce, Air
Staff Offi ce, and the Acquisition, Technology & Logistics
Agency (ATLA) as an external bureau have been
established in the MOD. The Internal Bureaus of the MOD

control within the MOD. Control within the MOD means that the Minister of Defense, a civilian, manages, operates, and controls the SDF. In addition to support from political appointees such as the
State Minister of Defense and Parliamentary Vice-Ministers of Defense, support from civilian offi cials in the Internal Bureaus also plays an important role in aiding the exercise of civilian control by
the Minister of Defense. The role of civilian offi cials in the Internal Bureaus in civilian control is to support the Minister of Defense, and there is no relationship in which civilian offi cials of the Internal

2 Strengthening integrated Operational Functions


In order to ensure the accuracy of decision-making
relating to the operations of the SDF and to make
the process swifter, in October 2015, the Bureau of
Operational Policy was abolished and some of this
Bureau’s functions such as the planning and drafting
of laws and regulations relating to unit operations were
transferred to the Bureau of Defense Policy in order to
unite affairs concerning actual operations of the units
into the Joint Staff. This change has made the Joint Staff

The MOD reform started in response to the frequent
incidence of scandals within the MOD/SDF, and the
“Council for Reforming the MInistry of Defense,”
which was held at the Prime minister’s offi ce in 2007,
put together the report containing measures against the
incidence of scandals and central organization reform.

the Deliberations on the MOD Reform, established in
the MOD in the same year, it was determined that the fullfl edged reform based on following four main points would
be undertaken: (1) mutual posting of civilian offi cials
and uniformed personnel; (2) total optimization of the
building-up of defense capability and the strengthening
of equipment acquisition functions; (3) strengthening of
integrated operational functions, and (4) strengthening of
policymaking functions and public relations capability.


3 Main Initiatives in FY2018


A certain level of achievement has been realized
regarding the reorganization of the MOD central
organization based on the “Direction of the MOD
Reform.” Meanwhile, the MOD has implemented the
following initiatives, considering the increasingly
severe security environment surrounding Japan and
the increasing need to advance various measures more
effectively and effi ciently.

-  Enhancement of policy making function by establishing
the position of the Director-General for Evidencebased Policymaking
For the building and strengthening of the function that
plays the central role of promoting the Evidence-Based
Policy Making (EBPM), the position of Director-General
for Evidence-based Policymaking responsible for the
overall coordination of the initiatives concerning the
promotion of the EBPM, such as conducting high-level
and fl exible adjustment of complex policy issues across
various agencies within the MOD, has been established.

-  Enhancement of the function of the Joint Staff Councilor
Considering the increasingly severe security environment
surrounding Japan, the position of the Joint Staff
Councilor has been upgraded from one councilor to
two councilors, and one of whom is called the Principal
Joint Staff Councilor, in order to enhance and strengthen
functions at the Joint Staff of external briefi ngs and
the communication and coordination with relevant
departments and divisions inside and outside the MOD.


2 Specifi c Initiatives on the Reform of the Ministry
of Defense


In accordance with the “Direction of the MOD Reform,”
the MOD has fostered a greater sense of unity by
promoting mutual posting of civilian offi cials and
uniformed personnel. In October 2015, in addition to
the previously mentioned reorganization at the Joint
Staff, a large-scale reorganization was implemented,
which included the establishment of the Acquisition,
Technology and Logistics Agency (ATLA) by bringing
together and consolidating the departments of the MOD
that had been related to procurement in order to accurately
respond to the extending equipment administration.
By conducting duties at these new organizations, the
MOD/SDF needs to ensure that this reform will be fi rmly
established, while assisting the Minister of Defense both
from a policy perspective of the Internal Bureaus and
from a military expert’s perspective of the each Staff
Offi ce, with each of them playing the role as the two
wheels of a vehicle.

**Section 2 Effective Deterrence and Response**


In order to respond to a variety of contingencies in a timely
and appropriate manner, and to assure the protection of the
lives and property of the people as well as territorial land,
water and airspace, it is necessary to make efforts to deter
the occurrence of a variety of contingencies before they
happen by building a comprehensive defense architecture.
If a contingency does occur, it is required to respond
seamlessly to the situations as they unfold. Therefore, it
is important to ensure information superiority[1] through


continuous surveillance over a wide region around Japan
during peacetime. If a contingency does arise, ensuring
maritime superiority[2] and air superiority[3] in our sea and
airspace in a timely manner is important to respond
effectively and minimize the damage.

[See] Reference 17 (Main Operations of the Self-Defense Forces);

[See]

Reference 18 (Statutory Provisions about Use of Force and Use
of Weapons by SDF Personnel or SDF Units)


1 Ensuring Security of Sea and Airspace Surrounding Japan


**(2) Response by the MOD/SDF**
The MSDF patrols the areas such as the waters
surrounding Hokkaido, the Sea of Japan, and the East
China Sea from peacetime, using patrol aircraft and
other aircraft. The ASDF uses radar sites at 28 locations
nationwide, and early warning and control aircraft
amongst others, to carry out warning and surveillance
activities over Japan and its surrounding airspace. These
activities of the MSDF and ASDF are done 24 hours
a day. Warning and surveillance activities in major
channels are also conducted 24 hours a day by MSDF
guard posts, GSDF coastal surveillance units, and other
assets.[5] Furthermore, warning and surveillance activities
are carried out with the fl exible use of destroyers,
aircraft, and so on as required. The information obtained
through such surveillance activities is shared with the
relevant ministries and agencies, including the Japan
Coast Guard, in order to strengthen coordination.


Japan is comprised of a little over 6,800 islands, and is
surrounded by wide sea space, which includes the sixth
largest[4] territorial waters (including inland waters) and
Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the world. The
SDF is engaged in persistent intelligence collection and
warning and surveillance during peacetime over Japan’s
territorial waters and airspace, as well as the surrounding
sea and airspace.


1 Warning and Surveillance in Waters and Airspace
Surrounding Japan


**(1) Basic Concept**
The SDF persistently engages in warning and surveillance
activities in the waters and airspace surrounding Japan
during peacetime so that it can respond to various
contingencies immediately and seamlessly.

To have an advantage over the opponent in terms of quickly and correctly identifying, collecting, processing, and conveying information.

Maritime superiority refers to the condition in which one side has a tactical advantage over the opposing force at sea and can carry out maritime operations without suffering substantial damages by
the opposing force.

Air superiority refers to the condition in which one side can carry out airborne operations without suffering a signifi cant level of obstruction by the opposing force.

Excluding overseas territories. The EEZ is the eighth largest in the world if overseas territories are included.

Article 4(1)18 of the Act for Establishment of the MOD (Investigation and research required for the performance of duties within jurisdiction) provides the legal basis for early warning surveillance


-----

Thus, the SDF maintains a defense and security
posture so that it can respond quickly to various
contingencies in areas surrounding Japan. The Ministry
of Defense and the SDF are working to share the
information collected by this type of early warning
surveillance activities and to reinforce our cooperation
with relevant ministries and agencies.
To show an example of the events that were reported
from SDF’s surveillance, following September 2012
when the Government of Japan acquired property rights
to and ownership of three of the Senkaku Islands (Uotsuri
Island, Minamikojima Island, and Kitakojima Island),
Chinese government vessels have carried out intermittent
intrusions into Japan’s territorial waters surrounding
the Senkaku Islands.[6] In June 2016, a Chinese Navy
combatant vessel entered Japan’s contiguous zone
to the north of the Senkaku Islands for the fi rst time.
Chinese Navy vessels continue their activities in the
sea areas surrounding Japan, and six vessels including
the Kuznetsov-class aircraft carrier “Liaoning” passed
through the sea area between the main island of Okinawa
and Miyako Island, and entered the western Pacifi c in
December 2016. This was the fi rst time that the entry of
this aircraft carrier into the Pacifi c Ocean was confi rmed.[7]
In July 2017, a Chinese naval intelligence collection ship
entered Japanese territorial waters southwest of Kojima
(Matsumae, Hokkaido) passing east through the Tsugaru
Strait to the Pacifi c Ocean for the fi rst time. In January
2018, the JSDF confi rmed that a Chinese submarine
and warship had been navigating through the Japanese
contiguous waters of the Senkaku Islands at the same
time (more about the submarine below). Furthermore, in
April, in waters some 350 km south of Yonaguni Island,
a number of (presumed) fi ghter jets were observed taking
off from the aircraft carrier Liaoning for the fi rst time.
It has been pointed out that North Korea is attempting
to evade United Nations Security Council sanctions
through smuggling. As part of its regular warning and
surveillance activities in Japanese territorial waters, the
Self Defense Force is carrying out information gathering
on vessels suspected of violating the UN Security
Council sanctions. In 2018, Self Defense Force patrol
aircraft have confi rmed nine observations[8] of seaborne

rendezvous between North Korean tankers and foreignfl agged tankers in the East China Sea to the end of June.
The information was shared with relevant agencies and
ministries. In a comprehensive judgment across the
government, the vessels concerned are strongly suspected
of engaging in transshipment of cargo with the North
Korean vessels, which is prohibited by UN Security
Council resolution. Japan reported this to the UN Security
Council Sanctions Committee on North Korea, shared the
information with relevant countries, sent letters of intent
to the relevant countries regarding the tankers concerned
and made public announcements on the subject.[9]

In response to these illicit maritime activities
including transshipments with North Korean vessels
prohibited under the UN Security Council resolution, the
United States and other concerned countries are carrying
out early warning surveillance activities using aircraft
based at the United States Kadena Air Base in Japan.
Australian and Canadian aircraft made patrol fl ights over
a one-month period starting in late April. In the same
month, the United Kingdom also announced that it would
contribute to the international operation to monitor illicit
transactions in North Korean waters and in early May, the
naval frigate HMS Sutherland conducted an information
gathering operation in the international waters around
Japan. The Ministry of Defense and the Self Defense
Force intend to continue their close cooperation with
concerned countries to ensure compliance with the UN
Security Council resolution.


Since December 26, 2015, Chinese government vessels equipped with weapons, which appear to be machine guns, have intruded into the territorial waters of Japan.

Activity associated with the passage of Chinese naval vessels through the Ryukyu Islands between Okinawa Hondo and Miyakojima Islands was confi rmed seven times in 2017.

Specifi cally, P-3C patrol planes of MSDF Air Patrol Squadron 1 observed rendezvous in the East China Sea on January 20, 2018 between North Korean tanker Rye Song Gang 1 and Dominican
Republic-fl agged tanker Yuk Tung, on February 13 between North Korean tanker Rye Song Gang 1 and Belize-fl agged tanker Wan Heng 11, on February 16 between North Korean tanker Yu Jong
2and a small vessel of unknown origin, on February 24 between North Korean tanker Chon Ma San and Maldives-fl agged tanker Xin Yuan 18, on May 19 between North Korean tanker Ji Song 6 and
a small vessel of unknown origin, on May 24 between North Korean tanker Sam Jong 2 and a vessel of unknown origin, on June 21 between North Korean tanker Yu Phyong 5 and a small vessel of
unknown origin, and the next day between North Korean tanker Yu Phyong 5 and a small vessel of unknown origin, believed to be the same boat, and on June 29 between North Korean tanker An
San 1 and a small vessel of unknown origin.

The initiative of the Japanese government to counter this type of transshipment was lauded by President Donald Trump at the U.S.-Japan summit meeting and by Secretary of Defense James Mattis

Those of us assigned to destroyers and other vessels work 24 hours in shifts on surveillance of foreign ships in the East China Sea.
As Master Chief Petty Offi cer, I strive to maintain discipline and morale on the ship and strengthen cohesion.
It is not easy to sustain motivation, reduce stress, and preserve mental health when working in the closed space of a ship
over a lengthy period. I am always making efforts in greetings and engaging in conversations. Greetings are the “lubricant of human
relationships” and serve to accelerate mutual understanding and trust building. Engaging in conversations is important to stay abreast of
changes in team spirit and health. In particular, I try to interact with younger members as much as I can. I learn about their personalities,
hobbies, concerns, and family members so that I can make conversation with them at any time. These conversations with younger
people often help me discover things about myself that I did not know. I refl ect on myself and learn every day.
Although it is a tough environment on the sea, I will continue to work hard while fostering communication among shipmates from
offi cers to young members through various events as well as taking rest in between duties.

airspace are detected, fi ghters and other aircraft scramble
to approach them in order to confi rm the situation and
monitor the aircraft as necessary. Furthermore, in the
event that this suspicious aircraft has actually intruded
into territorial airspace, a warning to leave the airspace
would be issued, among other responses.
In FY2016, ASDF aircraft scrambled 904 times,
which was a decrease by 264 times compared with the
previous fi scal year. However, this is the 6th highest
number of times since 1958 when scrambles commenced
and the number continues to be kept relatively high.
Breaking this fi gure down, planes were scrambled
500 times in response to Chinese aircraft. This is 351
fewer incidents than the previous year, which was a
record, but it is clear that Chinese aircraft continue to
be highly active, as this is the third highest fi gure since
the number of scrambles by country or territory was fi rst
made public in 2001.
A distinctive example arose in May 2017 when
a drone caused an airspace violation as it fl ew above a
Chinese naval vessel entering Japanese territorial waters
near the Senkaku Islands. In August last year, six Chinese
military bombers were observed in an unprecedented
fl ight from the East China Sea over Okinawa Hondo

an area off the Kii Peninsula before returning. Then in
December, fi ve aircraft including two fi ghter jets fl ew
over the Tsushima Strait and entered the Japan Sea
airspace. This was the fi rst time that a Chinese fi ghter has
been confi rmed entering the Japan Sea airspace. Then in
April 2018, a (presumed) unmanned Chinese aircraft fl ew
across the East China Sea.
With these kinds of acts, China is expanding the
scope of activities of its air force and escalating its actions
inside Japanese airspace. It is a troubling situation.
Planes were scrambled 390 times in response to
Russian aircraft, an increase of 89 events compared to
the year before. Russian aircraft remain active, including
unusual long-distance fl ights by two bombers through
Japanese airspace in August 2017 and February 2018.
Even after the establishment of the “East China Sea
Air Defense Identifi cation Zone” by China in November
2013, the MOD/SDF has implemented warning and
surveillance activities as before in the East China Sea,
including the zone in question, and has continued to
take all initiatives necessary to engage in warning and
surveillance in both the sea and airspace around Japan.

3 Response to Submarines Submerged in Japan’s
Territorial Waters

**(1) Basic Concept**
With respect to foreign submarines navigating underwater
in Japan’s territorial waters,[10] an order for maritime
security operations will be issued. The submarine will
be requested to navigate on the surface of the water and
show its fl ag, in accordance with international law, and
in the event that the submarine does not comply with
the request, the SDF will request it to leave Japanese
territorial waters.

The number of air sovereignty alert scrambles is on the sharp rise in the southwestern region. The number reached 803 in FY2016,
the highest on record. In such a situation, 9th Air Wing activated two fi ghter squadrons on January 31, 2016, followed by the
Southwestern Air Defense Force on July 1, 2017. The new structure ensures the air defense of the southwestern region.
As maintenance personnel, we have a sense of urgency all the time to carry out air alert missions. Upon receipt of a scramble
order, we rush from the nearby facility to the alert aircraft and conduct fi nal preparations so that the aircraft can take off as soon as
possible. I focus not only on swiftness, but also ensuring takeoff without a fl aw in maintenance. Maintaining an alert aircraft means
bearing responsibility for pilots’ lives. Pilots must carry out their missions safely and surely, and more importantly, return safely. With
that in mind, I commit myself to air alert missions.

**(2) Response by the MOD/SDF**
The MSDF is maintaining and enhancing capabilities
for: expressing its intention not to permit any navigation
that violates international law; and responding in shallow
water areas by detecting, identifying, and tracking
foreign submarines navigating under the territorial
waters of Japan. In November 2004, the MSDF observed
a submerged Chinese nuclear-powered submarine
navigating under Japanese territorial waters around
the Sakishima Islands. In response to this incident, the
MSDF issued an order for maritime security operations,
and continued to track the submarine with MSDF vessels
until it entered the high seas.
Maritime Self-Defense Force P-3C patrol aircraft
and others also confi rmed observation of submerged
submarines navigating through the Japanese contiguous
zones in May 2013 in waters south of Kumejima Island,
in March 2014 off the east coast of Miyakojima Island
and in February 2016 in waters southeast of Tsushima
Island. Further, in January 2018, a submerged submarine
was spotted by Maritime SDF assets including a
destroyer moving through Japanese contiguous zones of
the Senkaku Islands. The submarine was then observed
surfacing in international waters of the East China Sea
fl i th Chi fl Thi th fi t ti th t


Chinese naval submarine has been observed operating in
the Japanese contiguous zones of the Senkaku Islands.
Although international law does not forbid foreign
submarines navigating underwater in the contiguous
zone of coastal states, Japan maintains a posture to
appropriately deal with such activities.

4 Response to Armed Special Operations Vessels


**(1) Basic Concept**
The Japan Coast Guard, as a police organization, is
primarily responsible for responding to suspicious
armed special operations vessels (unidentifi ed vessels).
However, in the event that it is deemed extremely diffi cult
or impossible for the Japan Coast Guard to respond to a
situation, an order for maritime security operations will
be issued and the situation will be handled by the SDF in
cooperation with the Japan Coast Guard.

[See] Part II, Chapter 3, Section 2-3-2 (Maritime Security Operations)


**(2) Response by the MOD/SDF**

for the Vessel Boarding Inspection Team.
Furthermore, based on the “Manual on Joint
Strategies concerning Unidentifi ed Vessels” jointly
prepared by the then Japan Defense Agency and the Japan
Coast Guard in 1999, the MSDF also makes an effort to
strengthen cooperation between these two organizations,
conducting activities such as joint exercises periodically.

If signs of attack are detected in advance, troops
will be deployed and concentrated in an area expected
to be invaded ahead of the deployment of enemy units,
and, through the joint operation involving all the SDF
forces (the GSDF, MSDF, and ASDF), deter and remove
enemy attacks. If there is an invasion of the islands, the
enemy will be brought under control by ground fi re from
aircraft and vessels, and then tactical operations will
be implemented to regain the islands by the landing of


1 Basic Concept

Japan has a number of remote islands. In order to respond
to attacks on these islands, it is important to position units
and so forth in accordance with the security environment,
and also to obtain and secure maritime and air superiority
by detecting signs at an early stage through persistent
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR)
conducted by the SDF in peacetime.

of contingencies.
Also, in order to secure capabilities for swift and largescale transportation and deployment of units, initiatives
are underway to enhance rapid deployment capabilities
through: the improvement of Osumi class LST (Landing
Ship, Tank); a review of the role of multipurpose vessels;
and the introduction of V-22 Ospreys and C-2 transport
aircraft.
In particular, for the operation of V-22 Ospreys,
the MOD determined that the KYUSHU-SAGA
International AIRPORT was the best airfi eld to be used
as the deployment site for V-22 Ospreys due to positional
relationships with relevant units in joint operations, the
length of the runway, and the geographic environment that
can reduce burdens borne by the local community. The
MOD/SDF hopes to gain understanding from the local
community through providing in-depth explanations.[13]

Moreover, in addition to the acquisition of six fi ghter
aircraft (F-35A), one aerial refuelling and transport
aircraft (KC-46A) and four tilt-rotor aircraft (V-22) to
serve in responding to attacks on remote islands, the
FY2018 budget includes funds for research into the
technologies required for high-speed glide bombs and

2  Initiatives of the MOD/SDF


For defense posture buildup in the southwestern region,
the ASDF established the 9th Air Wing in January 2016
and newly formed the Southwestern Air Defense Force
in July 2017. The GSDF, in addition to the Yonaguni
coast observation unit formed in March 2016 and other
newly-formed units, established the Amphibious Rapid
Deployment Brigade with full-fl edged amphibious
operation capabilities in March 2018. Moreover, the
GSDF will deploy some units including an area security
unit in charge of the initial responses in Amami Oshima,
Miyako Island, and Ishigaki Island.
In addition, the MSDF will acquire P-1 fixed wing
patrol aircraft, SH-60K rotary wing patrol helicopters,
and other equipment. Through these initiatives, the
MOD/SDF will continue persistent ISR operations,
and develop an immediate response posture in the case

the introduction of Aegis Ashore).
In case ballistic missiles or other objects are launched
against Japan as an armed attack, it will be dealt with
by issuing a defense operation order for armed attack
situations. On the other hand, when such situation is not
yet acknowledged as an armed attack, Japan will take
measures to destroy the ballistic missiles.
As a response against ballistic missiles or other
objects, the Joint Task Force-BMD is formed, with the
Commander of the Air Defense Command serving as its
Commander, and various postures for effective defense
are to be taken under a unifi ed command through
JADGE. Furthermore, the GSDF will play a leading role
in dealing with damage caused by the impact of a fallen
ballistic missile.

[See] Fig. III-1-2-8 (Build-up and Operational Concept of BMD

(image)); Part II, Chapter 3, Section 2-3-4 (Destruction
Measures Against Ballistic Missiles)

**(2) Response by the MOD/SDF**
Since 2016, North Korea has conducted three nuclear
tests and 40 ballistic missile launches. These military
actions by North Korea are a severe and imminent threat
to the safety of Japan. Meanwhile, we believe that the
clear commitment made by Chairman Kim Jong-un at the
historic North Korea-United States summit held in June
2018 to fully denuclearize the Korean Peninsula, and


Japan began developing the Ballistic Missile Defense
(BMD) system in FY2004 to be fully prepared for the
response against ballistic missile attacks. Necessary
amendments were subsequently made to the SDF Law in
July 2005, and in December of the same year, the thenSecurity Council and Cabinet decided to begin Japan-U.S.
cooperative development of an advanced ballistic missile
interceptor. To date, Japan has steadily built up its own
defense system against ballistic missile attacks, by such
means as installing ballistic missile defense capability to
the Aegis-equipped destroyers and deploying the Patriot
Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3).[15]

[See] Reference 35 (History of Efforts for BMD Development in Japan)

1 Japan’s Ballistic Missile Defense


**(1) Basic Concept**
Currently, Japan’s BMD is an effective multi-layered
defense system with the upper tier interception by Aegisequipped destroyers and the lower tier by Patriot PAC3, both interconnected and coordinated by the Japan
Aerospace Defense Ground Environment (JADGE).[16]
The upcoming introduction of the land-based Aegis
system, Aegis Ashore, will enable our forces to
intercept missiles in the upper tier not just from Aegis
destroyers but from land (see below for more details on


14 In FY2017, it was conducted from November 6 to 24 at Numazu Beach Training Area, at Tanegashima/Tsushima and the surrounding areas, and at SDF facilities and related waters and airspace.
Approximately 15,000 personnel from the GSDF, MSDF and ASDF, approximately 1,500 vehicles, approximately 6 vessels, and approximately 170 aircraft participated in this exercise. They conducted
various exercises aimed at the maintenance and enhancement of their joint operational capabilities.

15 The Patriot PAC-3 system is one of the air defense systems for countering airborne threats. Unlike the conventional type of anti-aircraft PAC-2 missiles, which mainly intercepts aircraft and other
targets, the PAC-3 missiles are designed primarily to intercept ballistic missiles.

16 JADGE is a core system for the command and control as well as communication functions. It centrally processes the information regarding aircraft captured by radars installed nationwide, and it
provides fi ghters instructions required for scrambling against aircraft intruding into Japanese territorial airspace and air defense combat operations. In addition, it controls Patriot and radar, etc. in

repeated in writing, is highly signifi cant. We must now
carefully monitor the concrete actions of North Korea
toward the elimination of nuclear weapons and missiles.
North Korea probably possesses and has deployed
hundreds of Nodong missiles, which have almost all of
Japan within their range. Based on the progress of North
Korea’s nuclear and missile development gained through
successive nuclear tests and ballistic missile fi rings and
improved operational capability, our fundamental stance
on the threat posed by North Korean nuclear weapons
and missiles is unchanged.
Considering such a situation, the MOD/SDF, whose
mission is to protect the lives and assets of the people, are
not changing their intent to do everything necessary to be
sure that it is able to respond to any situation or state of
affairs, and continue to conduct the necessary intelligence
collection, warning and surveillance activities, and other
necessary activities while closely cooperating with the
United States and the Republic of Korea (ROK).
Further cooperation with the U.S. Government
including the U.S. Forces in Japan is essential for effi cient
and effective operation of the BMD system. Thus, related
measures including constant real-time sharing of BMD

operational and relevant information, and the expansion
of BMD cooperation have been agreed upon at the JapanU.S. Security Consultative Committee (2+2 Meeting).
Furthermore, Japan has closely cooperated with
the United States in responding to ballistic missiles, by
means such as receiving Shared Early Warning (SEW)[17]
from the U.S. Forces, and sharing intelligence gathered
by assets including transportable BMD radar (TPY-2
radar) and Aegis-equipped destroyers deployed in Japan
by the U.S. Forces.

**(3) Strengthening of the BMD System**
In light of the severe security environment, the MOD/
SDF have been taking necessary measures for improving
its capabilities for responding to ballistic missile attacks
based on the National Defense Program Guidelines
and the Mid-term Defense Program. For example, of
the six MSDF Aegis-equipped destroyers, the MOD is
currently refurbishing two without BMD capabilities,
Atago and Ashigara, to give them BMD capabilities
and this refurbishment of Atago was already completed
in December 2017. The MOD also decided to acquire
additional two Aegis-equipped destroyers with BMD
capabilities using the FY2015 and FY2016 budgets. These
projects will increase the number of Aegis-equipped
destroyers with BMD capabilities from the present fi ve
(including refurbished Atago) to eight by FY2020.
Meanwhile, Japan and the United States are jointly
developing advanced interceptor missiles for BMD (SM3 Block IIA), which will be the successor of SM-3 Block
IA to be mounted on Aegis-equipped destroyers, and
promoting the project to its deployment, in order to deal
with future threats posed by increasingly advanced and
diverse ballistic missile attacks.
At the National Security Council 9-Minister Meeting
in December 2016, a decision was made to transition to
joint production and the deployment phase. Following
the FY2017 budget, the expenses to acquire SM-3
Block IIA were budgeted in the FY2018. Acquisition
and deployment of SM-3 Block IIA are planned to be
implemented in FY2021.
In comparison with the previous SM-3 Block IA,
SM-3 Block IIA will have not only extended interceptable
altitude and coverage of protection, but also have enhanced
defeating capability and simultaneous engagement
capability. In addition, it is expected that the interception
capabilities of SM-3 Block IIA will be enhanced against
ballistic missiles equipped with interception avoidance
measures such as a decoy and ballistic missiles launched
with an intention to avoid being intercepted by taking a
higher than nominal trajectory (lofted trajectory).[19]

There will be eight Aegis-equipped destroyers with
BMD capabilities, and SM-3 Block IIA will also be
deployed. It is planned that there will be a strengthened
protection system by around FY2021.
With regard to Patriot PAC-3, necessary expenses
have been appropriated in the supplementary budget
for FY2017, which continued from the supplementary


Maintenance, enhancement and validation of JapanU.S. bilateral response capabilities have been actively
conducted through training and other activities. Since
2010, BMD exercise has been held between the MSDF and
the U.S. Navy, connecting their ships and other equipment
via a network and conducting a simulation of response
to ballistic missiles, to improve tactical capabilities and
strengthen bilateral coordination. In February 2018, the
Japan Air Self-Defense Force took part in this exercise
as a joint Japan-U.S. air defense/missile defense exercise
with the goal of improving strategic and tactical skills
and strengthening cooperation.
Beyond Japan-U.S. cooperation, there is also a
need to bolster cooperation between the United States,
Japan and the Republic of Korea. In October and again in
December 2017, trilateral ballistic missile informationsharing exercises were held in waters off Japan with the
objective of strengthening coordination.
With respect to the handling of fi nely detailed
information related to ballistic missiles, the passage
of the Specially Designated Secrets Act in December
2014 (Law no. 108, 2013) has established the basis for
protection of highly confi dential information related to
national security. This has promoted increased sharing of
information not just within the government but with the
United States and other relevant countries.
In addition, the General Security of Military
Information Agreement (GSOMIA)[18] entered into effect
on November, 2016. As GSOMIA serves as a framework
for protecting various confi dential information including
information regarding North Korea’s nuclear and missile
threat shared between Japan and the ROK, which will be
required for practical and effective responses to various
situations, further strengthening of the Japan-U.S.-ROK
relationship will be expected.
The SDF engages in various training on a daily basis
to improve its capability to counter ballistic missiles. It has
been conducting PAC- 3 maneuver deployment training
nationwide sequentially from June 2017 in an effort
to strengthen the SDF’s capability to counter ballistic
missiles and generate a sense of safety and security
among the public. It had conducted 20 training sessions
as of the end of June 2018 including deployments to U.S.
Forces Japan’s facilities.

will realize the extension of interception altitude from

with the current PAC-3.
With North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missiles
posing an unprecedentedly severe and imminent threat to
the safety of Japan, the country must work to drastically
upgrade its ballistic missile defense capabilities in
order to ensure constant and sustained protection. At
meetings of the National Security Council and Cabinet
in December 2017, a decision was made to purchase two
Aegis Ashore units, to be retained by the Ground Self
Defense Force. The aim is to improve the capability for
multi-layered defense of Japan against ballistic missile


attacks in addition to existing Aegis-equipped destroyers
and Patriot batteries.[20]

Commentary Land-based Aegis system (Aegis Ashore) **COLUMN**

Aegis Ashore is a land-based missile defense system (Aegis system) that consists of radar, a command communication system, an
interceptor missile launcher, and other equipment, which essentially constitutes the BMD part of an Aegis-equipped destroyer for
BMD, and is capable of intercepting ballistic missiles fl ying in the exosphere from the ground.
As North Korea still holds multiple and various types of ballistic missiles that include Japan within its fi ring range, this makes it
an imminent challenge for Japan to improve its BMD capability, the deployment of Aegis Ashore would fundamentally boost Japan’s
capabilities to protect itself seamlessly 24 hours a day and 365 days a year.
Generally speaking, it takes a long time to acquire new defense equipment. This does not change even in the event of an
emergency. Securing the lives and the peaceful livelihood of the Japanese people is the most important duty of the Government,
and the MOD considers it a matter of course to be prepared fully so that Japan can respond to any contingencies. Furthermore,
the working environment for crew onboard Aegis-equipped destroyer is extremely severe. These ships must make port calls for
maintenance and replenishment, creating gaps in defense posture. This means frequent long-term deployments for the crew to
eliminate those undesired intervals. This burden on personnel is anticipated to be lifted signifi cantly once Aegis Ashore is deployed.
Moreover, Aegis-equipped destroyer would be able to go back to their core duty of ensuring maritime security, and strengthening
Japan’s deterrence capability as a whole.
GSDF Araya Maneuver Area in Akita Prefecture and Mutsumi Maneuver Area in Yamaguchi Prefecture have been selected
as possible areas for the deployment of two Aegis Ashore sites after studies within the MOD. In light of this, Parliamentary ViceMinister of Defense Fukuda and Ono visited Akita and Yamaguchi prefectures on June 1, 2018. Defense Minister Onodera also
visited both prefectures on June 22 and gave a briefi ng on the necessity of the deployment. Not only will the MOD conduct a
thorough investigation and implement measures so that the deployment will not affect the livelihood of people in the communities,
but it will also continue to give sincere and detailed briefi ngs with the hope that doing so will resolve any questions and anxiety the
communities may have.


FY1999. As the result showed good prospects for resolving
initial technical challenges, in December 2005, the thenSecurity Council and the Cabinet decided to start JapanU.S. cooperative development of an advanced ballistic
missile interceptor by using the results of the project as a
technical basis. The joint development started in June 2006
with a view to expanding the coverage of protection[25] and
dealing with future threats posed by increasingly advanced
and diverse ballistic missiles attacks.
In February and June 2017, Japan and the United
States conducted tests of the SM-3 Block IIA interceptor
in waters off Hawaii. Analysis of the test data confi rmed
that it meets all performance requirements.
Currently, as part of development work, the United
States is carrying out validation of the data connection
between the Aegis system and the SM-3 Block IIA, and
between radars. Japan continues to cooperate as required.


Missile Defense of the United States and

[2]
Japan- U.S. BMD Technical Cooperation

**(1) Missile Defense of the United States**
The United States is developing a multi-tier missile
defense system that combines defense systems suited for
each of the following phases of the ballistic missile fl ight
path to provide a mutually complementary response:
(1) the boost phase, (2) the mid-course phase, and
(3) the terminal phase. Japan and the United States have
developed close coordination concerning ballistic missile
defense, and a part of the missile defense system of the
United States has been deployed in our country in a stepby-step manner.[24]


**(2) Japan-U.S. BMD Technology Cooperation, etc.**
The Government commenced a Japan-U.S. cooperative
research project on a sea-based upper-tier system in


24 Specifi cally, a TPY-2 radar (so-called “X-band radar”) for BMD has been deployed at the U.S. Shariki Communication Site in 2006, and BMD-capable Aegis ships have been forward deployed in Japan
and surrounding areas. In October 2006, Patriot PAC-3 units were deployed in Okinawa Prefecture, and in October 2007, a Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS) was deployed in Aomori Prefecture.
Furthermore, the 2nd TPY-2 radar was deployed at the U.S. Kyogamisaki Communication Site in December 2014.

25 With regard to the Japan-U.S. cooperative development, it is necessary to export BMD related arms from Japan to the United States. In accordance with the Chief Cabinet Secretary’s statement issued
in December 2004, it was determined that the Three Principles on Arms Exports would not apply to the BMD system and related matters under the condition that strict controls are maintained. Based
on these circumstances, it was decided that the prior consent of Japan could be given to the third party transfer of the SM-3 Block IIA under certain conditions. This decision was formally announced
in the Joint Statement of the Japan-U.S. Security Consultative Committee (2+2 Meeting) in June 2011.
The Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology (Three Principles) received Cabinet approval in April 2014. However, with regard to exceptional measures instigated before the

In Japan where most of the towns and cities are highly
urbanized, even small-scale infi ltrations and attacks can
pose a serious threat against the country’s peace and
security. These cases refer to various mode and forms
including illegal activities by infi ltrated foreign armed
agents[26] etc., and sabotage carried out by foreign guerillas
or special forces, which can be deemed as an armed attack
against Japan.


force, then public security operations by the SDF will be
implemented. Furthermore, if it has been confi rmed that
an armed attack is being carried out against Japan, the
SDF will respond under a defense operation order.


Responses to Attacks by Guerillas and Special

[2]
Operations Forces


Typical forms of attacks by guerrillas or special forces
include the destruction of critical private infrastructure and
other facilities, attacks against people, and assassinations
of dignitaries.
In dealing with attacks by guerrillas or special forces,
the MOD/SDF responds with a particular emphasis on
the establishment of a relevant information gathering
posture, warning and surveillance to prevent invasions in
coastal areas, protection of key facilities, and search and
destroy of invading guerrillas or special forces. Efforts
will be made for early detection of attacks and indications
through warning and surveillance, and, as required, the


1 Basic Concept


In the stage where the actual situation of intruders and
the details of the ongoing case are not clear, the police
primarily respond to the situation, while the MOD/SDF
will collect relevant information and reinforce the security
of the SDF facilities. When the situation is clearer and can
be dealt with by the general police force, various forms
of assistance such as transportation of police offi cers and
provision of equipment to the police force will be carried
out. If the case cannot be dealt with by the general police


-----

SDF units will be deployed to protect key facilities such as
nuclear power plants and necessary posture for protection
will be established at an early stage. Based on this, in
the event of an infi ltration of our territory by guerrillas
or special operations forces, they will be searched for
and detected by reconnaissance units, aviation units and
others and combat units will be promptly deployed to
besiege and capture or to destroy them.

with suspicious vessels are also continuously conducted
between the MSDF and the Japan Coast Guard.


4 Response to Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical
Weapons


In recent years, there has been strong recognition of the
danger of NBC (Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical)
weapon proliferation, which can cause indiscriminate
mass casualties and contamination of an extensive area,
and the means for transporting such weapons, as well
as related equipment and materials, to terrorists and
countries under suspicion of proliferating such weapons.
The sarin gas attack[30] on the Tokyo subway in March
1995 is one of the examples of an incident in which these
weapons were used.

**(1) Basic Concept**
In the event of the use of NBC weapons in Japan in a
way that corresponds to an armed attack, the SDF will
conduct defense operations to repel the armed attack and
rescue victims. Furthermore, in the event of the use of
NBC weapons in a way that does not correspond to an
armed attack but against which the general police alone
cannot maintain public security, the SDF will conduct
public security operations to suppress the armed group
and rescue victims in cooperation with related agencies.
Furthermore, when the incident does not fall under
the category of defense operations or public security
operations, the chemical protection units of the GSDF
and medical units of the ASDF, GSDF and MSDF will
cooperate with relevant organizations in information
gathering concerning the extent of the damage,
decontamination activities, transportation of the sick and
injured, and medical activities through disaster relief and
civil protection dispatches.


3 Response to Armed Agents


**(1) Basic Concept**
While the police assumes primary responsibility
for responding to illegal activities of armed agents,
the SDF will respond in accordance with situational
developments. When this happens, the SDF cooperates
with the police force. Accordingly, with regard to public
security operations of the SDF, the Basic Agreement[27]
concerning cooperation procedures between the SDF and
the police, as well as local agreements between GSDF
divisions/brigades and prefectural police forces, have
been concluded.[28]

[See] Part II, Chapter 3, Section 2-3-1, (Public Security Operations)

[See]


**(2) The MOD/SDF Initiatives**
The GSDF continues to conduct exercises nationwide with
the police of each prefecture and has been strengthening
such collaboration by, for example, conducting fi eld
exercises at nuclear power plants throughout the country
since 2012.[29] Furthermore, joint exercises in dealing

approval in 2013. Taking a broad view of ocean policy
from the perspective of security on the ocean, the Plan
states that the government will act as one in undertaking
“comprehensive maritime security” and promote a “free
and open Indo-Pacifi c Strategy” in collaboration and
cooperation with related countries.


1 Basic Approach by the Government


Based on the National Security Strategy (NSS), Japan
will play a leading role in maintaining and developing
“Open and Stable Seas,” and will take necessary measures
to address various threats in sea lanes of communication,
including counter-piracy operations, ensuring safe
maritime transport and promoting cooperation with other
countries by promoting necessary cooperation related
to maritime security. In addition, it is stated in NSS
that Japan will provide assistance to those coastal states
alongside the sea lanes of communication and other states
in enhancing their maritime law enforcement capabilities.
The new Basic Plan on Ocean Policy[31] was given
Cabinet approval in May 2018 after a review of the
Basic Plan on Ocean Policy that was given Cabinet

2 Initiatives of the MOD/SDF


In order to maintain the order of “Open and Stable
Seas” and to ensure the safety of maritime transport, the
MOD/SDF promotes various kinds of initiatives such
as implementing counter-piracy activities, providing
capacity building assistance to coastal countries, and
enhancing joint training using a variety of opportunities.

Utilization of satellites enables the remote sensing of,
communication at, and positioning on any area on Earth.
Thus, countries around the world actively use outer space
and make efforts to enhance the capabilities of a variety
of satellites such as imagery satellites, communication
satellites, and positioning satellites to enhance
information gathering capabilities as well as command
and control, and information and communications
capabilities. Under such circumstances, for Japan whose
defense force is built in line with the basic principles of
exclusively defense oriented policy, the use of space,
which does not belong to any territories of any nations
and is not constrained by such factors as the surface of
the terrain, is extremely important when: collecting
information to detect indications of various incidents in
advance and strengthening the surveillance activities in
its surrounding seas and airspace; and ensuring means of
communication by the SDF in their international peace
cooperation activities and other activities.

1 The Whole-of-Government Approach

The Offi ce of National Space Policy[32] established in the
Cabinet Offi ce in July 2012 engages in the planning,
drafting, coordinating, and other policy matters relating to
the Government’s development and use of space. In light
of the environmental changes surrounding space policy
and the new security policies stated in the NSS that was
approved by the Cabinet in 2013, the Basic Plan on Space
Policy[33] was decided upon in the Strategic Headquarters
for Space Development established within the Cabinet in
January 2015. This Basic Plan was prepared as a 10-year
development plan focusing on the next approximately 20
years to improve predictability of industries’ investments,
and strengthen the industrial base, and has the following
goals: (1) Ensuring space security; (2) Promoting the
use of space in the civilian sector; and (3) Maintaining


31 In addition to “Comprehensive Maritime Security,” given recent changes in the oceanic environment, basic principles are being established for key policies on oceans with respect to 1) promoting the
industrial use of the oceans, 2) sustaining and preserving the oceanic environment, 3) improving scientifi c knowledge, 4) deepening polar policies, 5) international collaboration and cooperation and
6) promoting the fostering of human resources for oceanic profession and the understanding of citizens.

32 In April 2016, the Offi ce of National Space Policy was reorganized into the National Space Policy Secretariat.

and strengthening of space industry and scientifi c/
technological bases. Amid rising dependence on space
systems and increasing threats and risks in space,
“mission assurance” initiatives are underway to ensure
stable space operations including detection and avoidance
of threats and risks, increased survivability of the systems
themselves and early recovery of functionality.
Responding to Japan’s progress in development and
use of outer space, the Diet approved two laws—the Act
on Ensuring Appropriate Handling of Satellite Remote
Sensing Data (Remote Sensing Data Act) and Act on
Launch of Artifi cial Satellites and Launch Vehicles and
Control of Artifi cial Satellites (Space Activities Act) in
November 2016, and Remote Sensing Data Act and part
of Space Activities Act went into effect in November 2017.
The Space Activities Act stipulates matters
necessary to secure public safety and provide prompt
protection of the victims from damages in Japan’s space
development and use, such as a permission system for
launching, obligation for compensation, and government
compensation. The government began accepting
applications for permission after the enforcement of
part of the Act. In addition, the Remote Sensing Data
Act established (1) a license pertaining to use of satellite
remote sensing instruments, (2) a certifi cation of persons
h dli t llit t i d t d (3) t


that enables the Prime Minister to issue an order to a
satellite remote sensing data holder to prohibit provision
of data under certain occasions.


2 Initiatives of the MOD/SDF


The use of space is extremely important for the MOD/
SDF to conduct a range of tasks effectively and effi ciently.
Thus, it is critically important for the MOD/SDF to be
able to continuously utilize space capabilities even in
contingencies. In order to do so, NDPG stipulates the MOD/
SDF to strengthen information gathering, C2 (command
& control) and satellite communication capabilities by
using multiple types of satellites with various sensors
and by enhancing the survivability of satellites through
such initiatives as Space Situational Awareness (SSA). In
implementing these initiatives, the MOD/SDF will form
partnerships with relevant institutions and organizations
both in Japan and the United States. As part of this
initiative, the MOD is advancing deliberations toward
Japan’s inaugural participation in the Schriever Wargame,
a multinational tabletop exercise hosted by the US Air
Force Space Command. This is meaningful for Japan in
terms of enhancing collaboration with partner countries
and drafting the national space policy in the future.

Strategy (NSS) and the NDPG, the MOD revised the
“Basic Policy Relating to the Development and Use of
Space” in August 2014. Also, from the perspective of
further promoting cooperation in the space fi eld between
the defense authorities of Japan and the United States,
the two countries established the “Japan-US Space
Cooperation Working Group (SCWG)” in April 2015
and so far held four meetings. The SCWG continues
to promote consideration in broader fi elds such as:
(1) promotion of policy-related consultation regarding
space, (2) closer information sharing, (3) cooperation
for nurturing and securing experts, and (4) continued
participation to tabletop exercises.
Furthermore, the MOD/SDF launched an X-band
defense communications satellite called Kirameki-2 in
January 2017 and Kirameki-1 in April 2018, owned and
operated by the MOD for the fi rst time, to be used for
the information communications of extremely important
command and control in unit operations. Going forward,
in light of the future increase in required communication,
the MOD will conduct steady development of Kirameki-3
to realize integrated communications as well as highspeed and large capacity communications, thereby aiming
for the early realization of a three-satellite system with all
of the three X-band defense communications satellites.


Development of the Space Situational Awareness

(SSA) System

When using outer space, it is necessary to ensure its
stable use. However, there has been a rapid increase in
the volume of space debris in outer space, raising the
risk of signifi cant damage to satellite functions caused
by collision between debris and satellite. In addition, it
is speculated that the development and verifi cation test
of a killer satellite, which approaches the target artifi cial
satellite to disturb, attack, and capture it, is underway,
increasing the threat to the stable use of outer space.
That is why the MOD, based on the Basic Plan on Space
Policy and through cooperation with relevant domestic
institutions such as the Japan Aerospace Exploration
Agency (JAXA) and the U.S., aims to establish Space
Situational Awareness (SSA) by 2022 to monitor and
maintain an accurate picture of conditions in space. It
is also working to deploy a radar and operating system
to monitor threats to Japanese satellites such as space
debris. For this to happen, the government agencies and
ministries concerned need to work together to build an
effective operating system. On this point, JAXA is devising
a plan to deploy radar able to monitor low orbit satellites
(at altitudes of up to 1,000 km) and a ground-based
optical telescope to monitor geostationary orbit satellites

(at altitudes of around 36,000km). Combined with the
radar of the MOD that will principally be dedicated to
the function of geostationary orbit monitoring, Japan is
planning an effective SSA program.
As the project to establish the system gets underway,
the preparation of the new radar and operating system
will build on the knowledge acquired by the ASDF in
establishing defense capabilities. A new unit to operate
the system is also being considered.
To establish SSA, it will be vital to continuously
exchange views and share information with foreign
allies, and to carry out discussions about the nature of

future cooperation. The MOD has taken part in the
annual SSA multinational tabletop exercise hosted by
the U.S. Strategic Command since 2016 with the purpose
of acquiring knowledge related to the operation of SSA
as well as of strengthening cooperation with the United
States. Such initiatives to upgrade our SSA capability
also contribute to the strengthening of deterrence against
new threats in space.

and serves as the control tower in taking measures and
responding to signifi cant cyber security incidents in
government organizations and agencies, as well as critical
infrastructures.
Furthermore, in September 2015, the Cyber Security
Strategy was formulated for the comprehensive and
effective promotion of measures pertaining to cyber
security, with the aims: to create and develop free, fair and
safe cyber space; to enhance the vitality of the economy
and society and realize their sustainable development; to
realize society in which citizens can live safely and with
peace of mind; to contribute to peace and stability of the
international community as well as the security of Japan.


Information and communications technology has
developed and been rapidly and widely adopted.
As a result, it is now an essential infrastructure for
socioeconomic activities. On the other hand, there is a
possibility that people’s life and economic activities will
be severely affected if the computer systems or networks
fail. The same is true of both the MOD/SDF. If the critical
functions of the SDF are intercepted by a cyber attack,
there is a possibility that problems that threaten the core
of Japan’s defense may arise.


The Whole-of-Government Approach and Other

[1]
Initiatives


With regard to cyber attacks, the number of cases recognized
as threats to Japanese governmental organizations and
agencies in FY2016 reached approximately 7,110,000,
and these threats have become increasingly serious.[34]

In order to deal with the increasing threat to cyber
security, in November 2014, the Cyber Security Basic
Act was enacted. The Act aims to contribute to the
security of Japan by clarifying the basic principles of
Japan’s cyber security measures and the responsibilities
of local governments, as well as by comprehensively
and effectively promoting the measures regarding cyber
security. In response to this, in January 2015, the Cyber
Security Strategic Headquarters was established in the
Cabinet and the National center of Incident readiness
and Strategy for Cyber Security (NISC)[35] was established
in the Cabinet Secretariat. The NISC is responsible for
planning and promotion of cyber security-related policies


2 Initiatives of the MOD/SDF

**(1) Contribution to the Whole-of-Government Approach**
Along with the National Police Agency, the Ministry
of Internal Affairs and Communications, the Ministry
of Economy, Trade and Industry, and the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, the MOD, as one of the fi ve government
agencies that cooperate particularly closely with the
NISC, participates in cyber attack response training and
personnel exchanges, and provides information about
cyber attacks, etc. to the cross-sector initiatives led by the
NISC as well as sending personnel to the Cyber incident
Mobile Assistant Team (CYMAT).
The MOD is considering applying the knowledge
and experience of the SDF to penetration tests of the IT
systems of government ministries and agencies conducted
by NISC.


34 Cybersecurity Annual Report 2016 (submitted at the “Information Security Policy Council” on July 13, 2017).

35 With the enactment of the Cyber Security Basic Act in January 2015, the National Information Security Center (NISC) was reorganized as the National center of Incident readiness and Strategy for
Cybersecurity (NISC). The NISC is responsible for the planning and promotion of cybersecurity-related policies and serves as the control tower in taking measures and responding to signifi cant

**(2) Unique Initiatives by the MOD/SDF**
As unique initiatives by the MOD/SDF, the SDF C4
(Command, Control, Communication & Computers)
Systems Command and other systems are monitoring
MOD/SDF communications networks around the clock.
In March 2014, a “Cyber Defense Group” was established
under the SDF C4 Systems Command to enhance and
strengthen the system.
In addition, the MOD/SDF is engaged in holistic
measures including the introduction of intrusion
prevention systems in order to increase the safety of
information and communication systems, development of
defense systems such as the security and analysis device
for cyber defense, enactment of regulations,[36] stipulating
postures and procedures for responding to cyber attacks,
and development of human resources and technological
bases, as well as research on cutting-edge technology.
In order to appropriately deal with cyber attacks
that are becoming more sophisticated and skilful by the
day, the Cyber Defense Group expands from 110 to 150
personnel, approximately, by the end of FY2018 and the
cyber protection units of the three services of SDF forces
are also to be increased. As a result, the total number


of units responsible for responding to cyber attacks is
increasing from 350 to 430 personnel.

[See] Fig. III-1-2-13 (MOD/SDF Comprehensive Measures to Deal

with Cyber Attacks); Reference 37 (Efforts in Recent Years by
the Ministry of Defense)

**(3) Cooperation with the United States**
Since comprehensive defense cooperation, including
joint response, between Japan and its ally the United
States is vital, the two countries set up the Cyber
Defense Policy Working Group (CDPWG) as a
framework between the defense authorities of Japan
and the United States. Under this framework, meetings
have been held five times to discuss the following
topics: (1) promotion of policy discussions regarding
cyber issues, (2) closer sharing of information,
(3) promotion of joint exercises incorporating response
to cyber attacks, and (4) matters such as cooperation
for training and maintaining experts. Moreover, in May
2015, the two countries announced a joint statement on
the specific future direction of the cooperation.
In addition, Japan’s cooperation with the United
States is to be further strengthened by such means as
participation in the “Japan-U.S. Cyber Dialogue,” a

of the “Japan-U.S. IT Forum,” a framework between the
defense authorities since 2002, and dispatching liaison
offi cers to the U.S. Army’s cyber educational institution.

**(4) Cooperation with Other Countries etc.**
Japan has held cyber dialogues with the respective defense
authorities of Australia, the United Kingdom, Estonia,
and others to exchange views on threat awareness and
relevant initiatives taken by each country. With NATO
(North Atlantic Treaty Organization), Japan carries
out initiatives looking at possible future operational
cooperation, such as establishing a cyber dialogue between
defense authorities called the Japan-NATO Expert Staff
Talks on Cyber Defense and participating in the cyber
defense exercise (Cyber Coalition) hosted by NATO as
an observer. Furthermore, Japan has participated in the
International Conference on Cyber Confl ict (CyCon),
and as an observer in a cyber defense exercise (Locked
Shields) organized by the Cooperative Cyber Defence
Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) based in Estonia. As
Japan received approval to join the CCDCOE in January


2018, the MOD is further developing collaborative
relationships in the cyber area through the dispatch of
personnel to the Centre.
In addition, the IT Forum has been held between the
defense authorities of Singapore, Vietnam, and Indonesia
to exchange views on initiatives in the information
communications area including cybersecurity and current
trends in technology.
Considering the fact that cyber attacks occur beyond
national borders, it is important to continue to strengthen
international cooperation in the cyber fi eld through
exchanges of views with defense authorities of other
countries and relevant organizations such as the Cooperative
Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE), and
active participation in cyber defense exercises.
In Japan, in July 2013, the “Cyber Defense Council”
(CDC) was set up, and its core members consist of
around ten companies in the defense industry with a
strong interest in cyber security. Efforts are being made
to improve capabilities to deal with cyber attacks by
the MOD/SDF, and the defense industry, through joint
exercise and other initiatives.


8 Response to Large-Scale Disasters

euthanization of poultries. Approximately 410 personnel
and 75 vehicles from SDF were dispatched to cope with
this situation.
c. Disaster Relief in Response to Forest Fire
Over the period from June 2017 to the end of May
2018, local authorities conducted fi refi ghting operations
against fi ghting forest fi res in Iwate Prefecture, Gunma
Prefecture, Tokyo, Nagano Prefecture (twice), Yamanashi
Prefecture, Hyogo Prefecture, Shimane Prefecture, Oita
Prefecture and Miyazaki Prefecture but were unable to
settle the situation despite their efforts. Based on requests
issued by the governors of these prefectures, the SDF
contributed to aerial fi refi ghting and other resources. SDF
dispatches were conducted 10 times in total, including
a total of some 110 personnel, around 37 vehicles and
some 110 aircraft. Approximately 1,778 tons of water
was applied on 414 occasions.
d. Disaster Relief in Response to Volcanic Eruption
In January 2018, a number of people were injured by falling
rocks at a ski resort in Kusatsu, Agatsuma District due to
the eruption of Mt. Kusatsu-Shirane. The SDF received
a request from the Governor of Gunma for disaster relief
and conducted a lifesaving mission. The mission was
composed of dispatches of around 280 personnel, around
75 vehicles and nine aircraft.
e. Disaster Relief in Response to Water Supply Relief
Since January 2018, water supply failures have occurred
in Sado, Niigata Prefecture, Uwajima, Ishikawa
Prefecture, Oda, Shimane Prefecture and Miyako,
Okinawa Prefecture, due to water pipe breakage, etc. In
response to disaster relief requests from the governors of
the prefectures affected, the SDF provided relief supplies
of water. These missions engaged around 765 personnel,
some 450 vehicles including water tank trailers, and
supplied approximately 349 tons of water in total.

f. Disaster Relief in Response to Heavy Snow
In February 2018, Awara City, Echizen City and Eiheiji
Town, Yoshida District in Fukui Prefecture were hit by
a blizzard that caused a large number of vehicles to be
stranded on roads. In response to a disaster relief request
from the Governor of Fukui Prefecture, a lifesaving
and snow-clearing mission was conducted. Some 4,960
personnel were dispatched along with some 820 vehicles,
rescuing some 1,190 trapped vehicles, providing 6,750
meals, clearing around 31.8 km of road and supplying
some 15,320 liters of fuel.
g. Disaster Relief to Save Lives after Landslide
In April 2018, Yabakei-cho in Nakatsu City, Oita
Prefecture was struck by a landslide. Houses were buried
in mud and residents were missing, feared dead. In
response to a disaster relief request from the Governor
of Oita Prefecture, a lifesaving mission was dispatched.
Some 3,250 personnel were deployed, along with some
845 vehicles and two aircraft.
h. Disaster Relief for Northern Osaka Prefecture Earthquake
In June 2018, an earthquake (magnitude 6.1) hit
northern Osaka Prefecture, resulting in water supply
interruptions in Suita, Mino, Takatsuki and Ibaraki,
Osaka Prefecture. In response to a disaster relief request
from the Governor of Osaka Prefecture, relief water
supply and showering facilities were provided. The
mission involved some 1,145 personnel, around 280
water trailers and 12 aircraft.
i. Disaster Relief in Response to July 2018 Flooding
Disaster
In July 2018, record levels of rain fell across a wide swath
of Japan from east to west, causing rivers to breach their
banks and multiple large scale fl ooding and landslide
events. In response to disaster relief requests from
the governors of Kyoto Prefecture, Hyogo Prefecture,
Okayama Prefecture, Hiroshima Prefecture, Yamaguchi
Prefecture, Kochi Prefecture, Ehime Prefecture and
Fukuoka Prefecture, around 300 liaison offi cers were


sent to coordinate closely with local governments in up
to 74 locations to save lives, rescuing stranded residents,
supplying water, providing bathing facilities, distributing
goods, preventing water intrusion and clearing roads.
In the wake of the fl ooding disaster, in order to take all
possible measures for disaster relief operations, SDF
Ready Reserve Personnel were called up for the third
time following the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake
and the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake with approximately
300 SDF Ready Reserve Personnel engaging in daily
support of survivors at its peak. This mission involved
approximately 31,500 personnel, 25 boats and 38 aircraft.
In total, 2,265 people were rescued, 3,035 tons of water
were supplied and 13,008 people were provided with

**(2) Transportation of Emergency Patients**
The SDF uses its aircraft to transport emergency patients
from isolated islands and remote areas with insuffi cient
medical facilities (transportation of emergency patients).
In FY2017, out of a total of 501 cases of disaster relief,
401 cases involved the transportation of emergency
patients, with dispatches to remote islands such as
the Southwestern Islands (Okinawa and Kagoshima
Prefectures), the Ogasawara Islands (Tokyo), and remote
islands of Nagasaki Prefecture representing the majority
of such cases.
In addition, the SDF carries out sea rescues upon
requests by the Japan Coast Guard on such occasions as
transport of emergency patients from vessels navigating
areas of ocean far from the mainland where the aircraft of
other organizations are unable to respond, due to reasons
including a short fl ight range; emergencies of vessels due
to incidents such as fi re, fl ooding or capsizing.
Furthermore, the SDF conducts wide-area medical
transport operations for serious-case patients, by the

Our 9th Engineer Group (Construction) handles disaster relief in
Asakura City and Toho Village in Fukuoka Prefecture. This area is
located on the Chikugo River, which is known for its extensive water
volume, and has Mount Sangun in the background. While it is rich in
natural beauty, water damage has often occurred.
A heavy rainfall and fl ood warning had been issued for the area
because of concentrated rain from the morning hours on July 5,
2017 (Wednesday). The Governor of Fukuoka Prefecture submitted
a disaster relief request to the 4th Division Commander at about
7 pm. I proceeded to Haki Branch Offi ce of Asakura City with police
guidance and dispatched a company to rescue people at Matsumoto Activity in Toho Village (Asakura, Fukuoka) (July 2017)
Elementary School and other isolated facilities following coordination
with local personnel.
In Toho Village, meanwhile, lack of road access prevented the liaison team from arriving at the Toho Village Offi ce. Without any
related information, I led the main body of the group in advancing to the area. We cleared the road using the group’s own construction
equipment while moving forward and arrived at Toho Village Offi ce early in the morning on July 6 (Thursday).
Our fi rst action was saving the lives of people trapped in homes destroyed by debris fl ow in the Iwaya area. I still remember my
exuberance in hearing the report of having saved parents and children trapped in debris with the guidance of employees at Toho
Village Offi ce. Throughout this disaster relief, I was alongside the village mayor, reviewing requests and sending orders to the various
units based on damage information.
We achieved our mission thanks to a spirit of putting victims fi rst and conducting activities in an integrated manner with local
public offi cials, police offi cers, and fi refi ghters. I am hoping for a prompt recovery by the area.

responding to fi re in the areas near SDF facilities.


**(5) Exercises Involving the SDF**
In order to respond to large-scale and various other
disasters in a speedy and appropriate manner, the SDF
carries out various disaster prevention drills, and also
actively participates in disaster prevention drills organized
by the Japanese Government or local governments and is
seeking to ensure cooperation with various ministries and
agencies, and local governments.
a. Joint Exercise for Rescue (JXR)
From June to July 2016, the SDF conducted a command
post exercise and a tabletop exercise in preparation for
the predicted Nankai Trough earthquake to enhance the
SDF’s earthquake response capability.
b. Tomodachi Rescue Exercise (TREX) Joint Disaster
Response Exercise with U.S. Forces
In November 2017, joint exercises were held with U.S.
Forces stationed in Japan in the scenario of a Nankai
Trench earthquake. The purpose of the exercise was
to maintain and enhance earthquake disaster handling
capabilities in collaboration between the SDF and U.S.
forces and to strengthen cooperation with relevant
local authorities.
c. Remote Island Disaster Relief Exercise (RIDEX)
In September 2017, the SDF participated in a general
disaster prevention training planned and organized
by Okinawa Prefecture and conducted a fi eld training
exercise to deal with sudden large-scale disasters in a
remote island to maintain as well as enhance the SDF’s
ability to respond to disasters in remote islands and
strengthen collaboration with relevant local authorities.
d. Other
The SDF worked to enhance their earthquake response
capability, for example, by conducting the Nankai Rescue
29 i i ti f th di t d th k


**(3) The MOD/SDF Response to Nuclear Disaster**
In order to respond to nuclear disasters, the MOD/SDF has
formulated “The SDF Nuclear Disaster Response Plan.”
The SDF also participates in general nuclear disaster
prevention drills jointly implemented by the government,
local governments, and nuclear operators, to confi rm the
effectiveness of municipal governments’ evacuation plan
and to strengthen cooperation with relevant agencies in
a nuclear disaster emergency. Moreover, since October
2014, SDF personnel (5 personnel as of April 1, 2018)
were transferred (on temporary assignment) to a section
in charge of nuclear disaster prevention within the Cabinet
Offi ce as part of an effort to enhance the effectiveness of
nuclear disaster response capabilities.

**(4) Formulating Plans for Responding to Various Disasters**
Formulating Plans for Responding to Various Disasters
in the event of the occurrence of various disasters, the
MOD/SDF will take all possible measures such as swift
transportation and deployment of suffi ciently sized units
in their initial response. By establishing a rotating staffi ng
posture based on a joint operational approach, the MOD/
SDF will ensure that it is able to sustain a well-prepared
condition for a long-term response. In doing so, the MOD/
SDF will fully take into account the lessons learned from
the Great East Japan Earthquake and other disasters.
The MOD/SDF is in the process of formulating
various contingency plans for responses to large-scale
earthquakes, which are under consideration at the

They also took part in the Ministry of Defense
Disaster Management Headquarters drill, drills held by
the Government Disaster Management Headquarters on
Disaster Prevention Day, and more.[37]

**(6) Collaboration with Local Governments and Other**
**Relevant Organizations**

It is important for the SDF to strengthen collaboration
with local governments and other relevant organizations
under normal circumstances for the purpose of conducting
disaster relief operations smoothly. For this reason, the SDF
implements various measures including: (1) Establishment
of the post of Liaison Offi cer for Civil Protection and
Disaster Management (administrative offi cial) at the SDF
Provincial Cooperation Offi ces; (2) Temporary assignment
of SDF offi cers to the department in charge of disaster
prevention at the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, and


mutual exchange between administrative offi cials of
both the GSDF Middle Army and Hyogo Prefectural
Government; and (3) Recommendation of retired SDF
personnel with knowledge in disaster prevention in
accordance with requests from local governments. As of the
end of March 2018, as many as 432 retired SDF personnel
are working in disaster prevention and other sections in
291 local governments in 45 prefectures throughout the
country. Such cooperation in human resources is a very
effective way of strengthening collaboration between
the MOD/SDF and local governments, and its effi cacy
was confi rmed through the experiences of the Great East
Japan Earthquake and other disasters. In particular, each
GSDF regional Army establishes a forum for interaction
with senior directors for crisis management and other
offi cials from local governments and share information
and exchange opinions to strengthen collaboration with
those local governments.

9 Response to Rescue and Transport of Japanese Nationals Overseas, etc.


In the event of natural disasters, insurgencies, and other
emergencies overseas, the Minister of Defense can order
SDF units to rescue or transport Japanese nationals and
other people overseas upon request from the Minister
for Foreign Affairs to guard, rescue or transport
Japanese nationals overseas, etc. and upon subsequent
consultations with the Minister, on the basis of Article
84-3 (rescue Japanese nationals overseas, etc.) or Article
84-4 (transport of Japanese nationals overseas, etc.) of the
SDF Law. For prompt and, appropriate implementation
of these activities regarding Japanese nationals overseas,
the SDF is prepared to dispatch its units swiftly.
Specifi cally, the SDF maintains operational readiness,
with the GSDF designating a helicopter unit and leading
transport unit personnel, the MSDF designating vessels
such as transport ships (including ship-based aircraft),
and the ASDF designating airlift units and personnel
for dispatch.
Since the rescue and transport of Japanese nationals
overseas require close coordination among the GSDF,
MSDF and ASDF, exercises for this operation are carried


out constantly. From September to October 2017, the
exercise for the transport of Japanese nationals overseas
was conducted in Djibouti with the aim of enhancing
overseas deployment and activity capabilities and
strengthening cooperation between the SDF and the
U.S. Forces. Furthermore, in December 2017, the SDF
carried out an exercise in Japan for the rescue of Japanese
nationals overseas to practice the whole process of the

ASDF personnel carrying out confi rmation tasks during training for the rescue Japanese
nationals overseas (Thailand) (February 2018)


37 In addition, the following drills were conducted and participated in, in 2017: 1) government tabletop drills, 2) the Nuclear Energy Disaster Prevention Drill, 3) the large tsunami disaster prevention
drill, 4) the drill for medical treatment activities following a large-scale earthquake, 5) a drill related to the Comprehensive Disaster Prevention Drill of Nine Prefectural and City Governments, 6)
a drill related to the joint disaster drill among the Kinki prefectures, 7) a drill related to the Nankai Trough Massive Earthquake Countermeasure Tokai Block Council Joint Disaster Simulation Drill,
8) a drill related to the Nankai Trough Massive Earthquake Countermeasure Kyushu Block Council Joint Disaster Simulation Drill, and 9) comprehensive disaster prevention drills conducted by

actions and coordination with related organizations for
the rescue in order to enhance integrated operational
capabilities and strengthen coordination with related
organizations. In January and February 2018, the MOD/
SDF also took the opportunity of the annual multilateral
joint exercise “Cobra Gold” taking place in Thailand
to conduct an exercise for the series of activities to
protect Japanese nationals overseas in cooperation
with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Japanese
Embassy in Thailand. The staff of the embassy and their
family members participated in the exercise as well the
collaboration between the MOD/SDF and the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs was strengthened through this exercise.
The MOD/SDF have conducted the transportation
of Japanese nationals in four cases. Responding to

plane in April 2004. In January 2013, a government
aircraft was deployed to bring seven Japanese nationals
and the remains of a further nine nationals back to Japan
following the kidnapping in Algeria.
With respect to the terrorist attack in Dhaka,
Bangladesh, which occurred in July 2016, the bodies of
Japanese victims (seven nationals), their families, and
other involved parties were transported to Japan. In relation
to the deterioration of the situation in South Sudan in July
of the same year, the ASDF transport aircraft C-130H
transported four embassy staff from Juba to Djibouti.

the GSDF, MSDF or ASDF for their bases or troops.
Comprehensive aerial defense aims to deal with enemy
aerial attacks at the farthest point from our territory,
prohibiting enemies from gaining air superiority and
preventing harm to the people and the sovereign territory
of Japan. At the same time, efforts will be made to
infl ict signifi cant damage on the enemy thus making the
continuation of their aerial attack diffi cult.

[See] Fig. III-1-2-16 (Example of Air Defense Operations)


The NDPG states that only the necessary level of readiness
against land invasions involving the mobilization of large
ground forces, which was expected primarily during the
Cold War, will be retained.
In the event of a military attack on Japan, the
SDF will respond with defensive mobilization. Their
operations are categorized into (1) operations for aerial
air defense operations, (2) defense operations protecting
waters around Japan, (3) operations protecting the
land, and (4) operations ensuring security in maritime
communication, based on the characteristic of their
purposes. In executing these operations, the U.S. Forces
will assist the operations implemented by the SDF and
deploy operations to complement the capabilities of the
SDF, including the use of striking power, in line with the
Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation.


Defense Operations Protecting Waters

[2]
Surrounding Japan

If an armed attack is carried out against Japan, which is an
island country, aerial attacks are expected to be combined with
attacks against our ships and territory by enemy destroyers.
In addition, transport vessels could be deployed to enable
massive enemy ground forces to invade our territory. Our
defense operations protecting the waters surrounding Japan
are composed of measures at sea, measures in waters around
our coasts, measures in major straits, and aerial defense
above waters around Japan. We need to protect the waters
around our country by combining these multiple operations,
blocking the invasion of our enemies, and attacking and
depleting their combat capabilities.

[See] Fig. III-1-2-17 (Example of the Strategy for Defending Sea

Areas Surrounding Japan)


1 Air Defense Operations


Based on the geographic features of Japan, in that it is
surrounded by the sea, and the features of modern wars,[38]
it is expected that Japan will be repeatedly hit by rapid
and surprise aerial attacks by aircraft and missiles in the
case where a full-scale invasion against Japan occurs.
Operations for aerial defense[39] can be categorized into
comprehensive aerial defense mainly conducted by
the ASDF and individual aerial defense conducted by


38 Aerial attacks are important elements infl uencing the results of modern wars. It is vital to obtain air superiority before or at the same time as implementing ground or maritime operations.

39 A special characteristic of aerial defense operations is that initial response is critical and can infl uence the entirety of operations. Thus, Japan needs to maintain its readiness for a quick initial response

Operations Ensuring Security in Maritime

[4] Transportation

Japan depends upon other countries for the supply of much
of its resources and food, making maritime transportation
routes the lifeblood for securing the foundation of our
existence and prosperity. Furthermore, if our country
comes under armed attack, etc., maritime transportation
routes will be the foundation to maintain continuous
warfare capabilities and enable the U.S. Forces to come
and assist in the defense of Japan.
In operations to ensure the safety of our maritime
transportation, the SDF combines various operations
such as anti-sea, anti-submarine, anti-air and anti-mine
operations to patrol,[40] defend SDF ships, and protect
straits and ports, as well as setting up sea lanes[41] to directly
defend Japanese ships, etc. Aerial defense (anti-air
operations) for Japanese ships on maritime transportation
routes is conducted by destroyers, and support from
fi ghter jets and other aircraft is provided as required.


3 Operations Protecting the Land


In order to invade the islands of Japan, invading countries
are expected to gain sea and air superiority, followed by
the landing of ground troops from the sea and airborne
troops from the air.
For invading ground and airborne troops, it tends to
be diffi cult to exert systematic combat capabilities while
they are moving on their vessels or aircraft or right before
or after they land in our territory. As we protect our land,
we need to make best use of this weakness to deal with our
enemies between coastal and sea areas or at landing points
as much as possible and attack them at an early stage.

Landing of Invading Forces)

ministries and agencies and with the participation of
local governments and others. They also participate
and cooperate in civilian protection exercises held
by other ministries, agencies and local governments.
As an example, in November 2017, the central
government (the Cabinet Offi ce and the Fire and
Disaster Management Agency) and local governments
(Nagasaki Prefecture and Unzen City) held a civilian
protection exercise in Unzen, Nagasaki Prefecture with
the scenario of a ballistic missile launch and landing,
one of the anticipated types of armed attack. The GSDF
and MSDF as well as Provincial Cooperation Offi ce
Nagasaki JSDF participated in the training.

[See] Document 39 (Participation of the Ministry of Defense and the

[See]

SDF in Civilian Protection Joint Training Exercises with Central
and Local Government Bodies (2017)

**(2) Ongoing Collaboration with Local Governments**
The Ministry of Defense and the SDF are establishing
liaison departments in Regional Armies and Provincial
Cooperation Offi ces to ensure ongoing and close
collaboration with local governments and other bodies.
Civilian protection councils are also being established
in local governments for comprehensive implementation
of measures to protect civilians. Representatives of each
branch of the SDF and Regional Defense Bureau offi cials
have been appointed to the councils.
Moreover, local governments are recruiting retired
SDF offi cers to serve as crisis managers. For example,
they act as coordinators with the Ministry of Defense and
the SDF, as well as developing and implementing joint
action plans and exercises.

Some examples of intelligence collection methods used
by the MOD/SDF include: (1) collecting, processing and
analyzing signals emanating from military communications
and electronic weapons in the air over Japanese territory;
(2) collecting, interpreting, and analyzing data from various
imagery satellites (including Information Gathering
Satellite);[42] (3) warning and surveillance activities by ships,
aircraft and other vehicles; (4) collecting and organizing
a variety of open source information; (5) information
exchanges with defense organizations of other nations; and
(6) intelligence collection conducted by defense attachés


Basic Policy on the Protection of Civilians and

[1]
the Role of the Ministry of Defense and the SDF

In March 2005, based on Article 32 of the Civil Protection
Act, the government established the Basic Guidelines for
the Protection of the People. It anticipates four types of
armed attack: 1) a land invasion, 2) an attack by guerrillas
or special forces, 3) a ballistic missile attack, 4) an air
attack and points to consider in taking measures to protect
civilians depending on the type of attack.
The MOD/SDF, based on the Civil Protection Act and
the Basic Guidelines, have developed a Civil Protection
Plan of the MOD and the Acquisition, Technology and
Logistics Agency. This plan stipulates that in a situation
where Japan is under attack, the SDF would make utmost
efforts to fulfi l its basic task of repelling the attack It also
states that, within the scope of no hindrance to the task,
the SDF would do as much as possible to protect civilians
through support on evacuation and disaster relief.

2 Initiatives by the Ministry of Defense and the
SDF to Facilitate Measures for Civilian Protection


**(1) Civilian Protection Training**

12 Response to Other Events


1 Military Intelligence Collection

For formulating defense policy accurately in response
to the changes in the situation and for operating
defense capabilities effectively in dealing with various
contingencies, it is necessary to grasp mid- to long-term
military trends in the neighboring countries of Japan and
to detect the indications of those situations at an early
stage. To this end, the MOD/SDF always makes efforts
to collect information swiftly and accurately by using
various methods.


42 Information Gathering Satellite (IGS) of the Japanese government is operated by the Cabinet Satellite Intelligence Center. The MOD, along with other ministries and agencies, utilizes the imagery

and other offi cials.
As the security environment surrounding Japan has
become increasingly severe, strengthening intelligence
capabilities is considered to be an increasingly important
issue. For this reason, the MOD is currently promoting
comprehensive enhancement of its intelligence capabilities
at all stages, including collecting, analyzing, sharing, and
securing intelligence. Specifi cally, the MOD will move
forward with the high-level use of geospatial data such as
visualization of situations by fusing various information,
securing highly competent analysts by such means as
integrating and strengthening educational curricula, and
enhancing the dispatch posture of defense attachés.
In light of the changing situation in Europe, the
dispatch of defense attachés to Finland, which was
suspended in 2014, was resumed in February 2018.
In March, additional offi cers were dispatched to the
Philippines and Viet Nam, countries located on sea lanes
vital to Japan. By the end of 2018, a new dispatch is
planned for Chile in view of the importance of collecting
strategic information in Pacifi c Rim countries. Additional
attachés are also anticipated to be dispatched to Malaysia,
a country located on key sea lanes and with which Japan is
increasingly engaged across a range of fi elds from military
exchange to capacity building support, defense equipment


and technology cooperation, and to Belgium, where NATO
and the EU are headquartered, in view of the importance of
ensuring continued robust collaboration, cooperation and
mutual security arrangements with Europe.

2 Initiative against Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP)
Attacks


Electromagnetic pulse attacks place an extreme burden
on electronics by generating instantaneous powerful
electromagnetic waves through nuclear explosions and
other means leading to their malfunctioning or destruction.
This type of attack would impact not just the defense fi eld
but Japanese people’s lives in general. Led by the Cabinet
Secretariat, the MOD, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport
and Tourism, and others are deliberating the necessary
cross-governmental countermeasures.
The MOD and the SDF will advance the multiplication
of the communications network required for information
sharing among the services, and conduct research on the
protection of components against EMP attacks. The FY2018
budget includes funding for research on a component of
EMP warhead and EMP protection technology.

**Chapter**

**Active Promotion**

**2**

**of Security Cooperation**


In situations where the need and potential for international
cooperation in the security and defense areas are increasing
unprecedentedly, the MOD/SDF is required to actively
contribute to ensuring the security of Japan, the peace
and stability of the region and the peace, stability, and
prosperity of the entire international community from the
perspective of “Proactive Contribution to Peace” based


on the principle of international cooperation. Specifi cally,
the MOD/SDF plans to enhance bilateral and multilateral
defense cooperation and exchanges, and more actively
promote the United Nations Peace Keeping Operations
(UNPKO), counter-piracy operations, international peace
cooperation activities, and other relevant missions as
avenues to address global security issues.


**Section 1 Towards Strategic International Defense Cooperation**


1 Signifi cance and Evolution of Security Cooperation and Dialogue, and Defense Cooperation and Exchanges


The peace and stability of the Asia-Pacifi c region are
closely linked to the security of Japan and growing more
important for the international community amid global
balance of power changes. While nations with large-scale
military power concentrate in the region, any framework
for regional security cooperation has not been suffi ciently
institutionalized. As national political, economic and
social systems differ widely in the region, visions of
security vary from country to country. Furthermore, there
have been an increasing number of unilateral actions
attempting to change the status quo by coercion without
paying respect to existing international law. The issues
involving the South China Sea, in particular, cause
concerns over the maintenance of the rule of law at sea,
freedom of navigation and overfl ight, and the stability
of the Southeast Asian region. Thus, responses to these
issues have become an important challenge to ensure the
regional stability.
Under such circumstances, strategic international
cooperation to promote bilateral and multilateral
security cooperation[1] and exchanges more effectively
in consideration of the international situation and
security challenges has been growingly required for
building confi dence between the relevant countries and
establishing a foundation for their cooperation to resolve
regional security issues.


Regarding the form of defense cooperation and
exchanges, Japan has long strived to alleviate any
conditions of confrontation and tension and foster a
collaborative and cooperative atmosphere by building
face-to-face relationships through bilateral dialogues
and exchanges. In addition, recognizing the increasing
need for international cooperation, Japan has recently
enhanced bilateral defense relationships from traditional
exchanges to deeper cooperation in a phased manner
by appropriately combining various means including
joint exercises and capacity building assistance,
defense equipment and technology cooperation, and
the development of institutional frameworks such as the
Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreements (ACSA).
In addition, multilateral regional security cooperation
and dialogue are in the process of evolving from those
that focus on dialogue to cooperation that seeks to build
regional order. It is important to promote bilateral and
multilateral defense cooperation and exchanges in a multilayered, practical manner for improving the regional and
global security environment.

2 Multilateral Security Framework and Dialogue Initiatives


Multilateral framework initiatives such as the ASEAN
Defence Ministers’ Meeting (ADMM)-Plus and the
ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF),[2] a security cooperation
framework in the Asia-Pacifi c region, have made steady
progress and serve as an important foundation for
cooperation and exchange in the areas of security and
defense. Japan has contributed to the enhancement of
multilateral cooperation in the region by holding the
Japan-ASEAN Defense Vice-Ministerial Forum and the
Tokyo Defense Forum annually.

1 Initiatives under the ASEAN Defence Ministers’
Meeting-Plus (ADMM-Plus) Framework

The ASEAN countries hold the ASEAN Defence
Ministers’ Meeting (ADMM), a ministerial level meeting
between defense authorities in the ASEAN region, and
the ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting-Plus (ADMMPlus) comprising the ASEAN members and eight nonASEAN countries including Japan.[3]

The ADMM-Plus is the only offi cial meeting of the
defense ministers in the Asia-Pacifi c region including
the countries outside the ASEAN region. Thus, the
ADMM-Plus is highly signifi cant from the perspective of
encouraging the development and deepening of security
and defense cooperation in the region. The MOD/SDF
has been participating in and providing support for the
meeting. Established under the ministerial meeting in


The ARF, a forum aimed at improving the security environment in the Asia-Pacifi c region through dialogue and cooperation on political and security issues, has been held since 1994. The ARF currently
comprises 26 countries and one organization as members and holds various inter-governmental meetings that are attended by both foreign affairs and defense offi cials to exchange opinions on the
regional situation and the security area. The 26 countries are the 10 ASEAN members (Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia (since 1995) and
Myanmar (since 1996)), Japan, Australia, Canada, China and India (since 1996), New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Republic of Korea (ROK), Russia, the United States and Mongolia (since 1998),
North Korea (since 2000), Pakistan (since 2004), Timor-Leste (since 2005), Bangladesh (since 2006), and Sri Lanka (since 2007). The organization member is the European Union (EU).

the ADMM-Plus are (1) the ASEAN Defence Senior
Offi cials’ Meeting (ADSOM)-Plus, (2) ADSOM-Plus
Working Group (ADSOM-Plus WG), and (3) Experts’
Working Groups (EWGs).[4]

In October 2017, Defense Minister Onodera
participated in the fourth ADMM-Plus, emphasizing that
the international community should be united to exert
maximum pressure on North Korea to change its policy
to dismantle all nuclear and ballistic missile problems,
noting that Japan was implementing joint drills with the
U.S. Navy in the South China Sea and other activities


contributing to free and open seas.
The joint declaration released by the ADMM, which
was held before the ADMM-Plus, included the promotion
of procedures for the Standard Operating procedure
(SOP) on the Multi-National Cooperation Centre
(MNCC) to be adopted as part of an ASEAN’s SOP.
MNCCs aim at maximizing the effectiveness of activities
of assisting states’ militaries, and SOP on MNCC was
prepared by the EWG on Humanitarian Assistance and
Disaster Relief, in which Japan and Laos served as cochairs from 2014 to 2017.

Regarding the ARF, in which mainly by diplomatic
authorities are engaged, concrete efforts[5] have been made
in recent years for specifi c initiatives in non-traditional
security areas such as disaster relief, maritime security,
and peacekeeping and peace building. The MOD/SDF
has been making active contributions to this forum. At
an Inter-Sessional Meeting on Maritime Security (ISM
on MS) that has been held since 2009,[6] for example,
Japan has taken leadership in formulating a collection of
best practices concerning support for capacity building
in the fi eld of maritime security. In the fi eld of disaster
relief, the MOD/SDF has dispatched SDF personnel and
aircraft to ARF Disaster Relief Exercises (ARF-DiREx)
conducted since 2009.

**(1) ASEAN-Japan Defence Ministers’ Informal Meeting**
**and Vientiane Vision**

Based on the proposal by Prime Minister Abe at the
ASEAN-Japan Commemorative Summit in December
2013, the fi rst ASEAN-Japan Defence Ministers’ Informal
Meeting took place in Bagan, Myanmar, in November
2014. This meeting, in which opinions were exchanged
on cooperation in non-traditional security areas such
as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR)
and maritime security, was a breakthrough opportunity
bringing defense ministers from Japan and the ASEAN
member states together for the fi rst time in the history of
nearly 50 years of friendship and cooperation between
Japan and ASEAN. This marked an important fi rst step
towards strengthening bilateral defense cooperation in
the future.
In November 2016, the second ASEAN-Japan
Defence Ministers’ Informal Meeting was held in
Vientiane, Laos. At that meeting, then Defense
Minister Inada proposed Japan’s own initiative called
the “Vientiane Vision: Japan’s Defense Cooperation
Initiative with ASEAN” as a guideline for JapanASEAN defense cooperation, which was welcomed by
all ASEAN member states. At the third ASEAN-Japan

and complex security issues.
Based on the vision, Japan has promoted practical
defense cooperation with ASEAN by combining diverse
measures including: (1) promotion of international
law to share understanding and experience regarding
international law, (2) capacity building assistance,
(3) defense equipment and technology cooperation,
(4) joint training and exercises, and (5) human resource
development and academic exchange. In June 2017, as
the fi rst Japan-ASEAN defense cooperation programs,
Japan implemented the Japan-ASEAN Ship Rider
Cooperation Program[7] on Destroyers Izumo and
Sazanami combining on-board training and seminars on
maritime security, humanitarian assistance, and disaster
relief (HA/DR) and the Japan-ASEAN Joint Exercise for
Rescue (JXR) Observation Program, inviting participants
from all ASEAN countries and the ASEAN Secretariat.
In August and September 2017, Japan conducted a
program which included a briefi ng at the Cabinet Offi ce,
a visit to the sight of the joint disaster prevention drills
by the nine municipalities in the Kanto region,[8] and a
tour in disaster prevention facilities in Tokyo for ASEAN
embassy offi cials in Tokyo. In February 2018, Japan
invited ASEAN countries to an observer program for the
Japan-U.S.-Australia Cope North Guam 2018 HA/DR
Exercise in Guam. In the same month, Japan conducted
the Japan-ASEAN Invitation Program on Humanitarian
Assistance and Disaster Relief, inviting participants
from all ASEAN countries and the ASEAN Secretariat
to promote capacity building, mutual understanding,


Defence Ministers’ Informal Meeting that took place
on the sidelines of the fourth ADMM-Plus meeting in
October 2017, Japan and ASEAN shared the recognition
that Japan-ASEAN defense cooperation has become
even more important as regional security has become
diverse and complex. ASEAN welcomed and supported
the “Vientiane Vision,” and Japan and ASEAN agreed
to further promote Japan-ASEAN defense cooperation
based on the vision.
The “Vientiane Vision” is the fi rst of its kind to
present an overall picture of the priority areas of the
future direction of ASEAN-wide defense cooperation in
a transparent manner. Specifi cally, the vision that urges
that cooperation contributing to capacity building in each
ASEAN country and the entire ASEAN give priority to
three points: (1) Consolidating the order based on the
principles of international law; (2) Promoting maritime

**(2) Japan-ASEAN Defense Vice-Ministerial Forum**
Since 2009, the MOD has annually held the JapanASEAN Defense Vice-Ministerial Forum for the purpose
of strengthening bilateral and multilateral relationships
through the development of human networks between
Japanese and ASEAN vice-ministerial level offi cials.
In September 2017, the MOD held the ninth JapanASEAN Defense Vice-Ministerial Forum in Fukuoka, in
which vice-ministerial level offi cials from all ASEAN
countries and the ASEAN Secretariat participated to
exchange their views on three themes: (1) ASEAN
at its 50th Anniversary: Achievements and Further
Enhancement of Unity, (2) Regional Security Situations,
and (3) The "Vientiane Vision": Current Status and
Prospects. The Japanese and ASEAN participants
recognized various regional common issues such as the
situation of the Korean Peninsula and the situation in the
East and South China Sea, and agreed that it is important
for Japan and ASEAN to respond to these challenges in
the closest cooperation


In addition, since 2001, the MOD has invited to
Japan key fi gures who are primarily involved in security
policy from countries in the Asia-Pacifi c region, with the
objective of promoting their understanding of Japan’s
security and defense policy as well as the current status
of the SDF.

and confi rming the measures for strengthening future
cooperation with those countries.

**(3) Service-to-Service Exchange Initiatives**
In October 2017, the Chief of Joint Staff participated
in a Japan-U.S.-ROK chief of defense conference,
agreeing with his counterparts to continue cooperation in
addressing common security issues to enhance regional
peace and stability.
The GSDF Chief of Staff participated in the 10th
Pacifi c Armies Chiefs Conference (PACC) sponsored by
the U.S. Army and the ROK Army in September 2017.
Through the conference, the GSDF Chief of Staff held
talks with his counterparts in other Pacifi c countries to
enhance confi dential relations at high levels. At JapanROK and Japan-U.S.-ROK talks, particularly, the
GSDF Chief of Staff confi rmed the need for enhancing
cooperation between Japanese and ROK army branches
to secure regional peace and stability.


The MSDF Chief of Staff attended the Regional
Seapower Symposium sponsored by the Italian Navy
in October 2017. Along with the U.S. Chief of Naval
Operations and the First Sea Lord of the British Royal
Navy, the MSDF Chief of Staff publicized the importance
of cooperation through capacity-building support and
Japan’s maritime security initiatives. As naval chiefs

confi dential relationship. The ASDF Chief of Staff also
participated in the Singapore Air Show in February 2018
and the Air Power Conference, a symposium sponsored
by the Australian Air Force, in March 2018, holding talks
with his counterparts from other participating countries
to enhance bilateral relations.


3 Promoting Capacity Building Assistance and Other Practical Multilateral Security Cooperation Initiatives


The security environment surrounding Japan has become
increasingly severe. As any country cannot maintain its
peace and stability on its own, it is indispensable for
the international community to unite to resolve global
issues. Under such a circumstance, capacity building
assistance especially in the security and defense-related
areas is increasingly becoming important. For this
reason, defense authorities of Southeast Asian and other
countries request the MOD to provide capacity building
assistance and express expectation for cooperation at
various opportunities such as international conferences
and bilateral meetings. The MOD/SDF is working to
further strengthen and deepen defense cooperation and
exchanges by combining capacity building assistance and
other diverse practical means.


1 Proactive and Strategic Initiatives for Capacity
Building Assistance

**(1) Objectives of Implementing Capacity Building**
**Assistance**

Providing assistance for capacity building has the
following objectives: (1) enabling recipient countries to
contribute to improving the global security environment;
(2) strengthening bilateral relationships with recipient
countries; (3) strengthening the relationships with other
donor countries such as the United States and Australia;
and (4) promoting Japan’s efforts to work proactively
and independently to realize regional peace and stability
to gain trust in the MOD/SDF and Japan as a whole.
Capacity building assistance initiatives also facilitate the
improvement of SDF capabilities.


-----

Capacity building assistance

Capacity building assistance is designed to proactively create regional

stability and improve the global security environment by enhancing the

capacity of recipient countries through continuous human resource

development and technical assistance in security and defense

fi elds on a regular basis. In the security and defense fi elds such as

humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, the disposal of landmines

and unexploded ordnances, military medicine, maritime security, and

UN peacekeeping operations, particularly, the MOD/SDF provides

support to armed forces and military-related organizations of other

countries by utilizing its own capabilities.


ASDF personnel providing capacity building assistance (in the area of cyber security) in Vietnam
(December 2017)

maintenance, training of Papua New Guinea personnel
for a military band, training of Uzbekistani personnel
for military medicine, and training of personnel from all
ASEAN countries and the ASEAN Secretariat for the
HA/DR area.
From January to March and from October to
December in 2017, the MOD/SDF implemented a program
for supporting the enhancement of disaster response
capacity for Djibouti forces, including education on
how to operate engineering equipment such as hydraulic
shovels, graders, and dozers, in order to strengthen the
bilateral relationship.


**(2) Specifi c Activities**
Japan launched capacity building assistance programs in
2012 to provide assistance in various areas such as HA/
DR, peacekeeping operations, maritime security, and
international law to 15 countries and one organization
mainly in the Asia-Pacifi c region.

[See] See Fig. III-2-1-4 (Recent Capacity Building Assistance

[See]

Initiatives) and Fig. III-2-1-5 (Past Capacity Building Assistance
Activities)

MOD/SDF capacity building assistance activities
include the dispatch of MOD/SDF offi cials to foreign
countries for long- to short-term programs. Long-term
dispatches include lectures and practical training for
large-scale systematic human resources development.
Short-term dispatches include seminar lectures by SDF
personnel with relevant knowledge. In addition, the
MOD/SDF invites foreign offi cials to Japan to observe
and experience SDF education and training operations.
Under long-term dispatch programs, the MOD/SDF
has provided technical assistance regarding engineering
activities such as road construction in Mongolia, which
builds on previous assistance, engineering assistance
for the Harii Hamutuk training program sponsored by
Australian forces in Timor-Leste, and support for a
military band from January to March 2018 in Papua New
Guinea, which is serving as the chair of the Asia-Pacifi c
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in 2018.
Short-term dispatch programs included human
resource development seminars on air rescue, aviation
medicine and cyber security areas in Vietnam, land
survey in Cambodia, seminars and practical trainings
for HA/DR and aviation meteorology areas in Myanmar,
support for the military band in Papua New Guinea, HA/
DR in Malaysia, and in Laos, and seminars for search and
rescue in Sri Lanka.
Under the invitation program, the MOD/SDF

**(3) Cooperation with Partner Countries**
In efforts to stabilize the regional security environment,
Japan’s cooperation with other donor countries is essential.
In particular, Japan’s capacity building cooperation with
the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom is
considered a priority.
The joint statement of the Japan-U.S. Security
Consultative Committee (SCC) in April 2015 states that
the two countries would strengthen their continued close
coordination on cooperation including capacity building
assistance to realize peace, stability, and prosperity in the
region. Furthermore, at a Japan-U.S. Defense Ministerial
Meeting in October 2017, Defense Minister Onodera
expressed that Japan would proceed with capacity
building initiatives for ASEAN based on the Vientiane
Vision. The two ministers then agreed to promote defense
cooperation with Southeast Asian countries, including
capacity building assistance.
Under a Japan-Australia personnel exchange
program, the MOD has accepted an offi cial from the
Australian Department of Defense to its International
Policy Division’s Capacity Building Offi ce each for three
i d f J l t S t b 2013 f F b

2018. In exchange, the MOD dispatched an official to
the Australian Department of Defense each for three
periods: three months from July 2015, one year from
August 2016, and an ongoing period from April 2016.
In November 2017, Japan and Australia held the fi rst
working group on capacity building assistance.
Japan has also cooperated with the United States and
Australia in capacity building assistance to Timor-Leste.
The SDF and the U.S. forces participated in the Harii
Hamutuk capacity building assistance program sponsored
by the Australian forces in Timor-Leste in October in
2015, 2016 and 2017, providing technical guidance on
engineering including construction for engineering units
of the Timor-Leste forces.
In the joint statement issued for the third Japan-UK
Foreign and Defense Ministerial Meeting in December
2017, Japan and the United Kingdom welcomed progress
of coordination of capacity building in developing
countries in Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Middle East
and Africa, and shared the view to use a coordination
mechanism for future joint capacity building in strategic
i iti h iti it d f t t


terrorism, cyber security, humanitarian assistance and
disaster relief, promotion of quality infrastructure, gender
equality, and demining.
It is important for Japan and other countries providing
capacity building assistance to conduct such assistance
effectively and effi ciently by closely coordinating with
and mutually complementing each other.


2 Pacifi c Partnership


The Pacifi c Partnership (PP), which started in 2007, is
an initiative in which naval vessels, primarily those from
the U.S. Navy, visit countries in the Asia-Pacifi c region
to provide medical care, conduct facility repair activities,
and engage in cultural exchange to strengthen cooperation
between countries participating in the initiative and
facilitate international peace cooperation activities
through cooperation with governments, military forces,
international organizations, and NGOs in those countries.
Japan has sent SDF medical personnel and units
under the Pacifi c Partnership since 2007. In 2018, Japan
dispatched medical personnel to Micronesia, Palau

**(2) Initiatives for Multilateral Joint Exercises**
a. Participation in and Hosting of Multilateral Joint
Exercises
The GSDF participated in the Khaan Quest multilateral
exercise in Mongolia in July 2017 and the Kamandag 2017
U.S.-Philippine joint exercise implemented the U.S. and
Philippine marines in the Philippines in September 2017.
In June 2017, the MSDF implemented the fi rst Pacifi c
Guardian multilateral joint exercise with the Canadian and
New Zealand navies in waters south of Japan’s Shikoku
Island. In July 2017, the MSDF implemented the JapanU.S.-India Malabar 2017 exercise in waters east of India,
sponsoring the annual trilateral naval drill for the fi rst time.
In November 2017, the MSDF conducted a joint exercise
with the U.S. and Indian navies in the Sea of Japan.
In December 2017, the ASDF took part in the
Christmas Drop Japan-U.S.-Australia joint humanitarian
assistance and disaster relief exercise in the Federal
States of Micronesia.


Security (WPS) international engagement conference

medical personnel to Vietnam for search and rescue
training and cultural exchange.


3 Multilateral Joint Training


**(1) Signifi cance of Multilateral Joint Training in the**
**Asia-Pacifi c Region**

In the Asia-Pacifi c region, the MOD/SDF has actively
participated in multilateral joint training in non-traditional
security fi elds, such as HA/DR and Non-combatant
Evacuation Operation (NEO), in addition to traditional
training conducted in preparation for combat situations.
It is important to participate in such multilateral training
so as not only to raise the skill level of the SDF, but also
to create a cooperative platform with relevant countries.
In light of this perspective, the MOD/SDF intends to
continue to actively engage in such training.

Offi cial in the Japan Ministry of Defence

Daniel Golding, Exchange Offi cial, Capacity Building Assistance Offi ce, International Policy Division

Since August 2016, I have been working as the Australian Department of Defence Exchange Offi cial within International Policy
Division in the Japan Ministry of Defense. I have been contributing to the planning and implementation of the JMOD’s regional capacity
building programs and engagement with security partners such as the United States and Australia. For example, I implemented a
new capacity building program to assist ASEAN member states improve their humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR)
capability. I also took part in coordinating the Australian Prime Minister’s visit to JGSDF Narashino Training Area and I joined the
Prime Minister’s offi ce call with Defense Minister Onodera in January 2018. I greatly appreciate the opportunities provided through
this exchange program to contribute to the continued enhancement of the Japan-Australia Special Strategic Partnership and to work
with and learn from my JMOD and JSDF colleagues.

Briefi ng participants of the Japan-ASEAN Invitation Program on HA/DR (February 2018)

b. Multilateral Tabletop Exercises, etc.
In September 2017, the SDF participated in Exercise
Equateur 2017, a multilateral exercise led by French
Armed forces stationed on New Caledonia, implementing
a multilateral command post exercise for island disaster
relief operations.
The GSDF has hosted the Multinational Cooperation
Program in the Asia Pacifi c (MCAP) every year since 2002
as part of its multilateral cooperation, inviting offi cers from
relevant countries. In November 2017, participants from
11 countries and the United Nations World Food Program
reviewed the past MCAP results to share knowledge about
humanitarian assistance and disaster relief and conducted
training for the Japan-U.S. Tomodachi Rescue Exercise
(TREX) for disaster prevention.

4 Promotion of Defense Cooperation and Exchanges


U.S. and Indian liaison offi cers on board of JA Izumo that participated in the Exercises Malabar 2017

have built up cooperation since then through the United
Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT),
Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq, and
various international disaster relief operations. When the
Great East Japan Earthquake occurred in March 2011,
the Australian Defense Force (ADF) dispatched three
out of its four transport aircraft to Japan to engage in
a disaster relief mission. Cooperation between the two
countries has deepened and is becoming more practical.
In the United Nations Mission in the Republic of South
Sudan (UNMISS), for example, Japan accepted two ADF
offi cers dispatched to engage in UNMISS operations
from January to May 2017 into the Japanese camp.
Against the background of the deepening defense
cooperation between Japan and Australia, the two countries
in March 2007 announced the Japan-Australia Joint
Declaration on Security Cooperation, Japan’s fi rst such joint
declaration focusing on security with a country other than
the United States. Japan and Australia have also developed
the foundation for cooperation such as the Japan-Australia
Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement ACSA, the
Japan-Australia Information Security Agreement, and
the Agreement between the Government of Japan and
the Government of Australia concerning the Transfer of
Defense Equipment and Technology.


In promoting cooperation and exchanges in the area of
security, it is necessary to strengthen them based on a
combination of the most optimal means while taking into
account the situations of cooperation partner countries
and their relationship with Japan. Therefore, not only
comprehensive efforts within multilateral frameworks
but also bilateral defense cooperation and exchanges
are important.


1 Japan-Australia Defense Cooperation and
Exchanges


**(1) Signifi cance of Defense Cooperation and Exchanges**
**with Australia**

Australia is a “Special Strategic Partner” for Japan in
the Asia-Pacifi c region as both Japan and Australia are
allied with the United States and share not only universal
values[11] but also strategic stakes and interests. In recent
years, particularly, Japan and Australia as responsible
countries in the Asia-Pacifi c region are strengthening
mutual cooperation focused on areas such as HA/DR
activities and cooperation in capacity building assistance.
Defense cooperation between Japan and Australia
started with cooperation in the United Nations Transitional
Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). The two countries


-----

Regarding the Japan-Australia ACSA,[12] a new
agreement for expanding the situations in which the
provision of goods and services is possible was signed
by the two countries in January 2017, followed by the
establishment of relevant laws and regulations. The new
agreement was concluded in light of the expansion of
cases in which the SDF and the ADF conduct operations
together due to the further advances in their defense
cooperation and exchanges, and the development of
the Legislation for Peace and Security in Japan. The
agreement was approved by the National Diet in April
2017 and put into force in September 2017. Relevant
domestic laws were developed then.
Japan will continue deepening its cooperative
relationship with Australia, a “Special Strategic Partner”
that has both intention and ability to contribute to the
maintenance of peace and stability in the region jointly
with Japan.

**(2) Recent Major Achievements in Defense Cooperation**
**and Exchanges**

In October 2017, Defense Minister Onodera held a
defense ministerial meeting with Australian Defense
Minister Payne on the occasion of the Fourth ADMMPlus meeting. The two ministers then agreed that Japan
and Australia would closely cooperate in deterring
provocative actions by North Korea and enhance
cooperation with relevant countries in regard to the South
China Sea situation through capacity building assistance
and joint exercises while securing their regional presence
along with the United States. They also agreed to
further develop Japan-Australia defense cooperation
and continue coordination on a bilateral agreement to
reciprocally improve procedures to facilitate the two
countries’ joint actions.
At a Japan-Australia Summit Meeting in January
2018, the two countries’ top leaders ordered their
respective defense ministers to pursue deeper and
wider bilateral defense cooperation including further
cooperation regarding exercises, operations, capacity
building, the exchange of visits between maritime/
ground/air force units, defense equipment, and science
and technology.


Regarding bilateral service-to-service cooperation
and exchanges, the MSDF dispatched P-3C anti-submarine
patrol aircraft to the Townsville Base in September
2017 to participate in Exercise Pacifi c Protector 2017
that Australia hosted under the Proliferation Security
Initiative (PSI). In the same month, Air Marshal Gavin
Davies, Chief of Air Force, Royal Australian Air Force,
visited Japan and agreed with the ASDF Chief of Staff
to form a sister squadron relationship between the two
countries’ aerial refueling and transport squadrons. In
October 2017, the MSDF conducted the Japan-Australia
Trident joint exercise with the Australian Navy. In the
same month, an Australian Air Force C-130J transport
squadron visited Japan for interaction with its ASDF
counterpart squadron. In November 2017, C-2 transport
aircraft of the ASDF called at Australia’s Richmond Air
Force Base for a service-to-service exchange. Through
such service-to-service cooperation and exchanges,
the two countries have tried to further promote mutual
understanding and confi dential relations.

with Australia (Past Three Years))

**(3) Cooperative Relationship between Japan, the United**
**States, and Australia**

Japan and Australia are both allied with the United States
and share universal values. They cooperate closely to
resolve various challenges the Asia-Pacifi c region and
the international community are facing. In order to ensure
the effectiveness and effi ciency of such cooperation, it is
important Japan and Australia to proactively promote
trilateral cooperation with the United States, whose
presence is indispensable for regional peace and stability.
The Security and Defense Cooperation Forum

Commentary Operation Christmas Drop **COLUMN**

Training names are often attached to joint training with other countries. The names are fundamentally based on the training
purpose and content. As the name suggests, the “Operation Christmas Drop” (offi cial name: Japan-U.S.-Australia joint training for
humanitarian assistance and disaster rescue in the Federated States of Micronesia and other countries) is a training for dropping
supplies around Christmas (in December). Supplies (daily goods, etc.) dropped in the training are given to people living in the
Federated States of Micronesia as assistance. These goods are donations mainly gathered by the U.S. Air Force and the philanthropic
organizations in the U.S. Good providers and training participants package the items together ahead of the drop. Participating aircraft
from the various countries are named “Santa No. ???” during the training period and embark toward the destination. Additionally,
the aircraft fl y at a low altitude of about 100m for the actual drop and this lets training participants see people waiting for the goods
waving from the ground. The drop hence feels like more than a simple provision of goods and truly a mission to “deliver gifts.”
Unlike training conducted at training grounds, the Operation Christmas Drop requires a decision on the drop point based on local
circumstances through watching resident movements on genuine outlying islands. It is a valuable opportunity that provides training
very similar to actual mission conditions. The “Santa” mission also raises the motivation of members and contributes to signifi cant
training results.

**and Exchanges**

While Japan and the Republic of Korea (ROK) have
diffi cult bilateral issues, it is important for them to
advance their relations in future oriented manner,
Both Japan and the ROK confront wide-ranging
complex security challenges including not only the
nuclear and missile issue of North Korea, but also counterterrorism measures, peacekeeping operations, responses
to large-scale natural disasters, counter-piracy measures,
and maritime security. In order to effectively address such
security challenges, the two countries should carry out
not just exchanges for increasing mutual understanding
and confi dence building but also more broad-ranging
concrete defense cooperation.

a. Overview
Since 2015, Japan’s defense cooperation and exchanges
with the ROK have been implemented at various levels
including ministerial and other high levels and unit levels.
In dealing with North Korea’s nuclear and missile
issue, particularly, Japan should strengthen cooperation
with the ROK in the security and defense areas. Following
North Korea’s ballistic missile launches in July and
September 2017, Japan-ROK Defense Ministerial
teleconferences were carried out swiftly on July 6 and
September 6. The Japanese and ROK Defense Ministers
then agreed that the two countries should be united to
address the North Korean nuclear and missile issue. In
this respect, they gave high ratings to past Japan-ROK
and Japan-U.S.-ROK cooperation and agreed to continue
close cooperation.

nuclear and ballistic missile tests from July 2017. They
then reaffi rmed that they should continuously enhance
their security cooperation and coordination to deter and
respond to North Korean threats and agreed to cooperate
with other countries in continuing to exert pressure on
North Korea to take concrete actions to terminate the
nuclear and ballistic missile program.
At the chief of staff level, the Chief of Joint Staff

continues defense exchanges to improve the transparency
of Chinese military and security policies and promote
measures such as the development of a framework to
avert or prevent unexpected incidents.

**(2) Recent Major Achievements in Defense Exchanges**
Japan-China defense exchanges stagnated following the
Japanese government’s acquisition of ownership of the
three Senkaku Islands (Uotsuri Island, Kitakojima Island,
and Minamikojima Island) in September 2012, but have
gradually resumed since the latter half of 2014.
In November 2015, Japan-China Defense Ministerial
Meeting was held for the fi rst time in four years and fi ve
months on the margins of the ADMM-Plus meeting. Then
Japanese Defense Minister Nakatani and Chinese Defense
Minister Chang Wanquan held a frank exchange of views
regarding various issues between the two countries and
shared the recognition that it would be important for Japan
and China to develop their defense exchanges. On the
occasion of the ADMM-Plus meeting in October 2017,
Defense Minister Onodera exchanged opinions with then
Chinese Defense Minister Chang Wan Quan as well.
In March 2015, the 13th Japan-China Security
Dialogue took place in Tokyo, with the two countries’
diplomatic and defense authorities participating. It was
the fi rst such meeting in four years. The 14th one came
in Beijing in November 2016 and the 15th in Tokyo in
October 2017.
Japanese and Chinese defense authorities have also
participated in the Japan-China High-Level Consultation
on Maritime Affairs. The latest meetings of the
consultation included the seventh one in Fukuoka in June
2017, the eighth one in Shanghai in December 2017 and
the ninth one in Sendai in April 2018.
In February 2018, Japan’s Sasakawa Peace
Foundation and China’s Ministry of National Defense
agreed to resume the Japan-China fi eld-grade offi cer
exchange program for the fi rst time in six years. In
April 2018, a Chinese delegation led by Major General
Ci Guowei, Deputy Chief of the Offi ce for International
Military Cooperation of the Ministry of National Defense,
paid a courtesy call on Defense Minister Onodera.
In efforts to build a “Mutually Benefi cial Relationship
Based on Common Strategic Interests,” Japan and


China must strive to promote confi dential relations and
mutual understanding through dialogue at various levels
in various areas and must proactively step up concrete
cooperation in non-traditional security areas, such as
counter-piracy measures.

**(3) “Maritime and Aerial Communication Mechanism**
**between the Defense Authorities of Japan and China”**

At Japan-China Summit Meetings in January and April
2007, then Japanese Prime Minister Abe and Chinese
Premier Wen Jiabao agreed to develop a mechanism for
communications, particularly maritime communications,
between the two countries’ defense authorities. Based
on the agreement, their defense authorities held the fi rst
Joint Working Group Meeting on the mechanism in April
2008 and accumulated talks. At the third Joint Working
Group Meeting in June 2012, they agreed on the basic
objectives and composition of the mechanism.
From the fourth Joint Working Group Meeting in
January 2015, diplomatic authorities of both countries
joined the negotiations.
After the eighth meeting of the Japan-China HighLevel Consultation on Maritime Affairs in December
2017 and the seventh Joint Working Group Meeting in
April 2018, Japanese and Chinese defense authorities
signed the memorandum[13] on the mechanism in the
presence of Japanese Prime Minister Abe and Chinese
Premier Li Keqiang on the occasion of the Japan-China
Summit Meeting in Tokyo in May 2018, and the operation
of this mechanizm commenced on June 8, 2018.
The “Maritime and Aerial Communication
Mechanism between the Defense Authorities of Japan
and China” has been developed (1) to promote mutual
understanding and confi dence between Japan and China
and to enhance bilateral defense cooperation, (2) to avoid
unexpected collision, and (3) to prevent unforeseen
circumstances in the sea and air from developing into
military clashes or political or diplomatic issues. The
mechanism’s main components include (1) annual and
expert meetings between the two countries’ defense
authorities, (2) a hotline between Japanese and Chinese
defense authorities, and (3) on scene communication
measures between vessels and aircrafts of the SDF and
the People’s Liberation Army.


-----

The signing of the memorandum after a decade of
negotiations is an important step for promoting mutual
understanding and confi dence between Japan and China
and very signifi cant for avoiding unexpected collision.
It is important for the mechanism to be operated in a
manner to contribute to building confi dential relations
between Japanese and Chinese defense authorities.

the activities of the Russian Armed Forces to enhance
armaments in the Far East, including the deployment of
surface-to-ship missiles on the Northern Territories and
the deployment of divisions on islands that may contain
the Four Northern Islands, expressing that these activities
confl icted with Japan’s stance that the Northern territory
is an inherent part of the territory of Japan and were
regrettable.
In part of recent major Japan-Russia military
exchanges, Valery Gerasimov, Chief of the General Staff
of the Russian Armed Forces, visited Japan and met with
the SDF Chief of Joint Staff in December 2017. They
exchanged opinions on matters of interest to the two
countries regarding security and agreed on the need for

5 Japan-Russia Defense Exchanges
and Cooperation


**(1) Signifi cance of Defense Exchanges and Cooperation**
**with Russia**

Given that Russia is a key security player in the AsiaPacifi c region and an important country neighboring
Japan, it is very important for Japan to promote
confi dential relations with Russia through bilateral
defense exchanges. As Japan-Russia relations have
continuously been developing in a wide range of areas,
the MOD/SDF has continuously conducted various
dialogues with Russian defense authorities according to
the Memorandum on Japan-Russia Defense Exchanges
signed in 1999 (revised in 2006), annual meetings
based on the Japan-Russia Agreement on Prevention of
Incidents on and over the High Seas,[14] and joint search
and rescue exercises.
The Government of Japan deals with the relationships
with Russia appropriately while emphasizing the
solidarity of the G7 (Group of Seven), taking the Ukrainian
situation and other factors into account. At the same time,
it is important to maintain constant contacts with Russia,
as one of Japan’s neighbors, at the working level to avoid
unforeseen circumstances or unnecessary confl icts. The
MOD considers these points in a comprehensive manner
and advances defense exchanges with Russia accordingly.

6 Defense Cooperation and Exchanges with
ASEAN Member States

ASEAN member states continue to experience rapid
economic growth and are garnering international attention
for their potential as a growth center that is open to the
world. Such ASEAN member states and Japan have been
traditional partners with a history of exchanges and a
close economic relationship over the past nearly 50 years.
ASEAN member states, located in geopolitically
important areas occupying strategic points on Japanese
sea lanes, are also playing an important role in ensuring
the peace and prosperity of Japan as well as the entire
region. Therefore, it is important for Japan to strengthen
cooperation in the security and defense areas and enhance
confi dential relations with ASEAN member states.
Based on this principle, Japan and ASEAN member
states have been working to foster trust and deepen
mutual understanding through high-level and workinglevel exchanges and promoting effective cooperation
such as capacity building cooperation, joint exercises,
and defense equipment and technology cooperation. In
addition to these bilateral cooperation efforts, Japan has
strengthened cooperation under multilateral frameworks
such as the ADMM-Plus and ARF. At the second ASEANJapan Defense Ministers’ Informal Meeting in Laos in
November 2016, Defense Minister Inada announced
the “Vientiane Vision” as a guideline for the JapanASEAN defense cooperation going forward. The vision
provided an overall picture of the priority areas of the
future direction of ASEAN-wide defense cooperation in
a transparent manner for the fi rst time and was welcomed
by all ASEAN member states.
From the viewpoint of actively promoting such
bilateral and multilateral cooperation and stabilizing the
security environment of the Asia-Pacifi c region, Japan
strives to strengthen defense cooperation and exchanges
with ASEAN member states.

VOICE Participation in the International Fleet Review **COLUMN**

for the ASEAN 50th Anniversary

Destroyer Oonami (Yokosuka),
Commanding Offi cer, Commander Hirotaka Okumura

I participated in the International Fleet Review for the ASEAN 50th Anniversary held in Pattaya (Kingdom of Thailand) in November
2017 along with about 180 crew members and one on-board aircraft as the commanding offi cer of Destroyer Oonami. The
participation in the International Fleet Review and related events held with a unifi ed crew under a slogan of “representing our country
despite being small” that showed the strength of Japan Maritime Self Defense Force to other participating countries.
The event that stood out the most to me was the city parade that took placein poor conditions with roads fl ooded to just
below the knee due to a sudden squall, though November is the dry season in Thailand. While the rain had stopped and water in
front of the viewing stand had pulled back when the parade began, conditions in starting point were not good and many countries
proceeded carefully while closely watching their footsteps. Japan’s Oonami crew members advanced in an orderly manner and
proudly salutedthe inspector. We received praise from Thai people and other countries.
By publicly demonstrating the strength of the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force at the city parade, rail manning in the fl eet
review, and other unit actions as representatives of Japan, Japan obtained the trust of ASEAN countries and the US, Australia, and
other friendly countries. I am very proud and appreciative of our members.

8 Defense Cooperation and Exchanges with
European Countries

Europe shares universal values with Japan and plays a
central role in working to address common challenges
to global security, focusing primarily on non-traditional
security areas such as counter-terrorism and combating
piracy, as well as international peace cooperation
activities. In this regard, promoting defense cooperation
and exchanges with European countries provides the
foundations for Japan to become actively involved in
dealing with these challenges and is important for both
Japan and Europe.

Exchanges (June 2017-June 2018)); Reference 54 (Recent
Defense Cooperation and Exchanges with European Countries
(Past Three Years))

**(1) The United Kingdom**
The United Kingdom, being a major power that has
infl uence not only in Europe but also in the rest of the
world, has historically maintained close relations with
Japan. On the security front, Japan shares the same
strategic interests as the United Kingdom, as both
countries are important allies of the United States. Given
this relationship, it is extremely important for Japan
to promote cooperation with the United Kingdom by
working together on global issues such as international
peace cooperation activities, counter-terrorism and
counter-piracy operations and by exchanging information
on regional situations.
With regard to Japan’s relationship with the United
Kingdom, the Memorandum on Defense Cooperation
was signed in June 2012. Following this, Agreement on
the Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology came
into effect in July 2013 and the Japan-U.K. Information
Security Agreement entered into force in January 2014,
leading to the development of a foundation for defense
equipment and technology cooperation as well as
information sharing between the two countries.
At the Japan-U.K. Summit Meeting in May 2014,
prime ministers of both countries agreed to hold a JapanU.K. “2+2” Foreign and Defense Ministerial Meeting
and begin negotiations on the ACSA in order to enhance
bilateral cooperation in the security fi eld. Following
this, the fi rst “2+2” Meeting was held in January 2015.
At the meeting, the two countries agreed to strengthen
cooperation in the security and defense fi elds and shared
strategic situational awareness. During the second “2+2”
Meeting in January 2016, the two countries agreed to
promote joint exercise, cooperate in defense equipment

two countries to implement the mutual provision of goods
and services such as water, food, fuel and transportation
between the SDF and the British Armed Forces through
unifi ed procedures in joint exercises and large-scale
disaster relief operations, further facilitating and
strengthening the Japan-U.K. strategic partnership. The
Japan-U.K. Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation,
issued during the Japan-U.K. Summit Meeting in August
2017, stipulated that the two countries agreed to develop
an action plan with specifi c measures relating to bilateral
security cooperation between the relevant authorities. At
the third Japan-U.K. “2+2” Meeting in December 2017,
the two countries included the bilateral ground exercises,
British naval ships’ deployment to the Asia-Pacifi c region
and joint exercises with the SDF, and prototyping of new
air-to-air missiles as a joint research into a joint statement,
demonstrating that bilateral security cooperation was
steadily deepening.
In June 2018, Defense Minister Onodera conducted
the Japan-U.K. Defense Ministerial Meeting with
Defense Minister Williamson on the occasion of the
Shangri-La Dialogue. Based on the joint statement at the
Japan-U.K. “2+2” Meeting in December 2017, the two
ministers agreed to continuously promote Japan-U.K.
defense cooperation including the expansion of British
warships into the Asia-Pacifi c region, the joint exercise
between Japanese and British ground services planned for
autumn 2018, and other service-to-service exchanges and
joint exercises. They also exchanged views on defense
equipment and technology and agreed to continue defense
equipment and technology cooperation, including a
Japan-U.K. joint study on potential cooperation regarding

future fi ghter aircraft. On the North Korea issue, Defense
Minister Onodera stated that cooperation between the
British Navy and the MSDF in warning and surveillance
activities against offshore North Korean ship-to-ship
cargo transfers of goods were signifi cant for securing
the effectiveness of relevant United Nations Security
Council resolutions, and that such activities had come to
lead North Korea to change policies. As Defense Minister
Onodera mentioned the need for continuing sanctions
on North Korea, Defense Minister Williamson said the
United Kingdom would support the Japanese stance.
In part of recent working-level exchanges, the
Administrative Vice-Minister of Defense visited the
United Kingdom in February 2018 and paid a courtesy
call to Frederick Curzon, Minister of State for Defense
and Deputy Leader of the House of Lords. In part of recent

I took part in the Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT) at RAF Fairford, United Kingdom, as a KC-767 crew member. RIAT is the
world’s largest airshow and 246 military and commercial aircraft from 26 countries participated in the event. The Air Self-Defense
Force KC-767 on static display attracted many visitors both civil and military and there was a long queue to catch a glimpse of it.
We could see high interest in the Air Self-Defense Force by the visitors’ enthusiastic look on their faces staring at on-board panel
description. In addition, the Air Self-Defense Force taiko drummers performed beside the tanker every day. The taiko performance
was a huge success with the audience gathering around the drummers. Some came to see our performance several times and
called for encores. What surprised me most was that more visitors than I had imagined visited the UK all the way from Japan just
to see the airshow. It was a precious and worthwhile experience that I was involved in the event of a global attention to promote the
Air-Self Defense Force and to help deepen the understanding of its roles. I am proud and honored to have this opportunity and hope
to join the airshow again in the future.

VOICE My Experience from Japan-ASEAN Ship-Rider Cooperation Program **[COLUMN]**

Indonesia Navy
Lieutenant Junior Grade, Muhammad Alfa Desdianto

As the representative of Indonesia Navy, getting the chance to board on JS Izumo was an invaluable experience for me because it
was a grand opportunity to take a tour on the ship and meet with other participants from different parts of ASEAN countries, while
having discussions and exchanging ideas that would help broaden the networks and strengthen our friendships.
Throughout the week of the program, I was fortunate enough to get the chance to participate in various attractive activities such
as Search and Rescue exercise and Ship Handling on board. There were also many advanced weapons systems provided in the ship
which I was glad I had the opportunity to see. I have learned another valuable experience during the visits. The ship crews provided
excellent technical services and hospitality to the participants, this has given me the insight into the roles and responsibilities I have to
apply later when having guests to visit our ships. Also, even though there were cultural differences among the participants, everyone
was very considerate and respected each other well. They were very open to any suggestions and ideas, therefore created a good
atmosphere in the environment.
Overall, I was very happy with the amount of things I have learned and experiences from being the participant in the Japan-
ASEAN Ship-Rider Cooperation Program on JS Izumo. I hope to be able to get another chance to participate in other international
events like this as the representative of Indonesia.

**Section 2 Ensuring Maritime Security**


For Japan, a major maritime state, strengthening order
on the seas based on such fundamental principles as the
rule of law and the freedom of navigation, as well as
ensuring safe maritime transport, is a foundation of its
peace and prosperity, which is extremely important. In
cooperation with the relevant countries, the MOD/SDF
engages in anti-piracy operations, as well as promotes

various initiatives including assistance for capacity
building in this fi eld for coastal states, and making the

and exercises in waters other than those in the immediate
vicinity of Japan.

of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden.
To date, approximately 30 countries, including the
United States, have dispatched their warships to the waters
off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden. As part
of its counter-piracy initiatives, the European Union (EU)
has been conducting Operation Atalanta since December
2008, in addition to the counter-piracy operations
conducted by the Combined Task Force 151 (CTF 151)[2]
that was established in January 2009. Meanwhile, other
countries have been dispatching their assets to the area.
The international community continues to have a critical
interest in and take actions to tackle the acts of piracy off
the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden.
As these initiatives by the international community
have proved to be effective, the number of acts of piracy


Piracy is a grave threat to public safety and order on the
seas. In particular, for Japan, which depends on maritime
transportation to import most of the resources and food
necessary for its survival and prosperity as a maritime
nation, it is an important issue that cannot be ignored.


1 Basic Approach


The Japan Coast Guard (JCG), one of the law enforcement
agencies in Japan, is primarily responsible for coping with
piracy. However, in cases where it is deemed extremely
diffi cult or impossible for the JCG to cope with piracy by
itself, the SDF is to take action as well.

occurring in the waters off the coast of Somalia and in
the Gulf of Aden has currently hovered at a low level.
However, the assumed root causes of piracy such as
terrorism and poverty in Somalia have still remained
unsolved. In addition, considering the fact that Somalia’s
capability to crack down on piracy is also still insuffi cient,
if the international community reduces its counter-piracy
efforts, the situation could be easily reversed. Therefore,
there is no great change in the situation in which Japan
must carry out its counter-piracy operations.

nations from acts of piracy, regardless of their fl ag
states. Moreover, it also enabled the use of weapons to
a reasonable extent, if no other means were available, in
order to halt vessels engaging in acts of piracy, such as
approaching civilian vessels.
Furthermore, the Act on Special Measures
concerning the Security of Japanese Flagged Vessels in
Areas that Are Highly Susceptible to Acts of Piracy came
into force on November 2013, which made it possible to
have security guards on board a Japanese ship provided
certain requirements are met, enabling them to carry
small arms for the purpose of security operations.

**(2) Activities by the Self-Defense Forces**

[See] Fig. III-2-2-2 (SDF’s Counter-Piracy Operations)

Fig. III-2-2-3 (Structure of the Deployed Forces)

a. Deployment Surface Force for Counter Piracy
Enforcement
The Deployment Surface Force for Counter Piracy
Enforcement (DSPE) is a unit that conducts counterpiracy measures using MSDF destroyers. The DSPE
strives to ensure the safety of ships navigating in the area
in two different manners – direct escort of private vessels
across the Gulf of Aden, and zone defense in allocated


areas in the Gulf of Aden. In addition, there are JCG
offi cers aboard the MSDF destroyer.[4]
In recent years, while there are still ongoing requests
for escort from vessels that are vulnerable to piracy such
as tankers with relatively low speed and low broadside,
the demand for direct escort has been decreasing. This
is partly due to the existence of other initiatives for selfdefense of private vessels involving the boarding of
private armed security guards.
As this trend was expected to continue, the
Government of Japan determined that the SDF would
decrease the planned number of direct escorts and carry
out zone defense during the period when direct escort is
not conducted. Accordingly the Government of Japan
changed the number of the deployed MSDF destroyers
from two to one for operations off the coast of Somalia
and in the Gulf of Aden from December 2016: (1) based
on the number of destroyers in recent years, the planned
number of direct escorts in a month would be decreased,
and at the same time, (2) during the period when direct
escort is not conducted, zone defense would be carried
out instead.
b. Deployment Air Force for Counter Piracy Enforcement
The Deployment Air Force for Counter Piracy
Enforcement (DAPE) is a unit conducting counterpiracy activities using the MSDF P-3C patrol aircraft
(two aircraft dispatched). The unit conducts warning and


-----

surveillance operations in the fl ight zone that is determined
in coordination with the CTF 151 headquarters[5] and
confi rms any suspicious boats. At the same time, the
unit also provides information to the MSDF destroyers,
the naval vessels of other countries and civilian vessels,
responding by such means as confi rming the safety
of the surrounding area immediately, if requested.
The information gathered by SDF P-3Cs is constantly
shared with other related organizations, and contributes
signifi cantly to deterring acts of piracy and disarming
vessels suspected of being pirate ships.
c. Deployment Support Group for Counter Piracy
Enforcement
In order to improve the operational effi ciency and
effectiveness of the DAPE, the Deployment Support
Group for Counter Piracy Enforcement (DGPE) carries
out activities such as maintenance of the facility set up
in the northwest district of Djibouti International Airport.
The Ministry decided to lease adjacent land on the eastern
side of the site that does not have a structure and is empty,
in addition to the site itself, from November 2017 from a
standpoint of strengthening security.
d. Transport Unit
The Airlift Squadron regularly operates ASDF transport
aircraft to carry out air transport of materials required by
the DAPE and the DGPE.
e. Combined Task Force 151 (CTF 151) Deployed unit at
the Headquarters
In order to strengthen coordination with the units of
other countries engaged in counter-piracy operations and
enhance the effectiveness of the SDF’s counter- piracy
operations, the MOD decided to dispatch SDF personnel
serving as the CTF 151 commander and the headquarter
staff in July 2014, and has dispatched SDF personnel to
the CTF 151 Headquarters where an offi cer from other
countries serves as the commander since August 2014.
During the period from May to August 2015, the SDF
also dispatched a CTF 151 commander for the fi rst time,[6]


while between March and June 2017 and March and June
2018 a CTF 151 commander as well as staff were also
dispatched to the Headquarters.
f. Achievements
As of May 31, 2018, the DSPE has escorted 3,826
vessels. Under the protection of the SDF destroyers, not a
single vessel has come to any harm from pirates and these
vessels have all passed safely across the Gulf of Aden.
As for the DAPE, it commenced the counter-piracy
operations in June 2009. As of May 31, 2018, the DAPE
has conducted the following activities: aircraft have fl own
1,951 missions with their fl ying hours totaling 14,910
hours; and information was provided to vessels navigating
the area and other countries engaging in counter-piracy
operations on around 13,160 occasions. The activities
conducted by the DAPE account for approximately 7080% of the warning and surveillance operations carried
out in the Gulf of Aden by the international community.


4 Praise for Japan’s Endeavors


The counter-piracy operations by the SDF have been
highly praised by the international community. For
example, national leaders and others have expressed
their gratitude and the SDF has also been repeatedly
well-received by the United Nations Security Council
Resolution. Moreover, the MSDF destroyers, which
are engaging in counter-piracy operations off the coast
of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden, has received many
messages from the captains and ship owners of the vessels
that its units have escorted, expressing their gratitude that
the ships were able to cross the Gulf of Aden with peace
of mind and asking them to continue escorting ships there.
Additionally, The Japanese Shipowners' Association
and other groups expressed appreciation for protection
of Japan-related vessels and asked for continuation of
efforts in fi ghting against piracy.


In addition, DAPE has been participating in CTF 151 since February 2014. This participation enabled the force to acquire information that was previously not accessible. Moreover, it became possible
to conduct more fl exible warning and surveillance activities. For example, aircraft can be deployed as needed even to areas that are highly susceptible to acts of piracy, and as a result, coordination
between other countries’ units was further enhanced.

Meanwhile, the SDF is enhancing informationgathering abilities and protection abilities, which are
required for the SDF units to carry out their missions while
ensuring the safety of personnel and unit in international
peacekeeping activities, etc. In addition, in order to
respond to various environments and prolonged missions,
the SDF is improving its capabilities for transport,
deployment, and information communication, as well as
developing a structure of logistic and medical support for
conducting smooth and continuous operations.
With regard to the education necessary for
engaging in international peace cooperation activities,
the GSDF International Peace Cooperation Activities
Training Unit, which belongs to the Ground Component
Command, provides training for GSDF personnel to be
deployed to international peace cooperation activities,
as well as supports their training. In addition, the Japan
Peacekeeping Training and Research Center (JPC) of
the Joint Staff College offers not only a basic education
courses on international peace cooperation activities, but
also specialized education to train personnel who can
be appointed as contingent commanders of UN PKO
missions and staff offi cers of mission headquarters.
These specialized courses are conducted by using UN
standard training materials and foreign instructors.
Furthermore, since FY2014, the JPC has also provided
education for personnel from foreign militaries and
other Japanese ministries and agencies. This initiative
represents the approach taken by the MOD/ SDF, which
emphasize the necessity of collaboration and cooperation
with other related ministries and foreign countries, based
on the current situation of more multi-dimensional and


complicated international peace cooperation activities.
The initiative aims to contribute to more effective
international peace cooperation activities by enhancing
the collaboration in the fi eld of education.

SDF personnel are expected to fulfi ll their assigned duty
under severe working conditions while being far away
from their home country and their families. Therefore, it
is extremely important to make necessary arrangements
so that dispatched SDF personnel can effectively carry out
their assigned duty while maintaining both their physical
and mental health. For this reason, the MOD/SDF has
implemented various measures to support families to
reduce anxiety for the dispatched SDF personnel and
their families.
In addition, the SDF also provides the following
mental health checkups on an ongoing basis for all the
personnel to be sent: (1) a pre-dispatch course to acquire
necessary knowledge on stress reduction; (2) mental
health assessment conducted several times during the
pre-dispatch to post-dispatch period; (3) counseling on
anxiety, trouble and other matters among the dispatched
personnel provided by mental health personnel being
dispatched; (4) dispatch of mental healthcare support
teams from Japan consisting mainly of medical offi cers
with specialized knowledge; (5) education before
returning to Japan for reducing stress upon return;
(6) temporary health checkups after returning to Japan.


2 Initiatives to Support UN Peacekeeping Operations, etc.


As a means to promote peace and stability in confl ict
regions around the world, UN Peacekeeping Operations
(PKO) have expanded their missions in recent years to
include such duties as the Protection of Civilians (POC),
the promotion of political processes, providing assistance
in Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration
(DDR) into society of former soldiers, Security Sector
Reform (SSR), the rule of law, elections, human rights,
and other fi elds, in addition to such traditional missions
as ceasefi re monitoring. To date, there are 14 UN PKO
missions ongoing (as of the end of May 2018).

more deeply about how the SDF should contribute
to the international community. Therefore, regarding
international peace cooperation operations and other
relevant missions, the SDF will continue to proactively
take part in peacekeeping activities by utilizing their
accumulated experiences and advanced skills in fi elds
such as engineering, as well as by expanding the dispatch
of SDF personnel to further responsible positions,
such as mission headquarters and the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations in the UN. As such, the SDF
places more emphasis on taking more of a leading role,
and the MOD/SDF will be proactively involved in Japan’s
initiatives for international contribution.


United Nations Mission in the Republic of South

Sudan (UNMISS)


**(1) Background to the Decision to Dispatch Personnel**
**to UNMISS**

The UN Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) was established
following the signing of the Comprehensive Peace
Agreement (CPA) between the Government of Sudan
and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/ Army in
January 2005.
Beginning in October 2008, Japan dispatched
two GSDF offi cers to UNMIS headquarters as staff
offi cers (logistics and database offi cers), but UNMIS
ended its mission in July 2011 following South
Sudan’s independence. Meanwhile, with the objective
of consolidating peace and security as well as helping
establish necessary conditions for the development
of South Sudan, the UN Mission in the Republic of
South Sudan (UNMISS) was established. The Japanese
Government was requested by the UN to cooperate with
UNMISS, particularly through the dispatch of GSDF
engineering units. The Cabinet approved the dispatch
of two staff offi cers (logistics and database offi cers) to
UNMISS in November 2011, and in December it decided
to dispatch an SDF engineering unit, Coordination Center,
and an additional staff offi cer (engineering offi cer). In
addition, the Cabinet also approved the dispatch of one
staff offi cer (air operations offi cer) in October 2014.
South Sudan shares borders with six countries and
is positioned in a highly important location, connecting
the African continent on all four points of the compass.
The peace and stability of South Sudan is not only
essential for the country itself; but also for the peace and
stability in its neighboring countries, and by extension,

**(2) Activities by the SDF**
In January 2012, a then Coordination Center of the SDF
was established for the fi rst time in the SDF’s participation
in UN PKO, both in the South Sudan capital city of Juba
and in Uganda, in order for coordination of the activities
conducted by the dispatched engineering unit. Since
the commencement of its engineering activities within
UN facilities in Juba in March 2012, the dispatched
engineering unit has steadily expanded its activities.
The SDF has continued to dispatch over 300 personnel
after the second unit took over in June of the same year,
and carried out activities with great signifi cance such as
repairing roads and constructing facilities for displaced
people while ensuring the safety of the personnel.


On November 15, 2016, the Cabinet approved
the changes to the International Peace Cooperation
Assignment Implementation Plan for South Sudan
after the deliberations by the National Security Council
(9-minister meeting). After the 11th rotation took over
in December 2016, the dispatched unit was assigned the
task of so-called “kaketsuke-keigo” operations, which
was approved by the Legislation for Peace and Security,
as well as the task to carry out joint protection of camps.
The deployment of SDF engineering units marked a
milestone of fi ve years in January 2017 since the dispatch
of the fi rst engineering rotation. In all of the PKOs
conducted by Japan, the unit has made a record number
of achievements. The major achievements include a total
of approximately 260 km of road repair and a total of
approximately 500,000 m[2] of development.
Japan could move on to a new phase regarding
engineering activities in Juba that the SDF was in
charge of. Considering the above-mentioned issues
in a comprehensive manner, on March 10, 2017, the
Government of Japan came to the conclusion that the
SDF engineering unit would withdraw from Juba around

provided training on the operation and maintenance of
heavy machinery to UNMISS personnel, so that UNMISS
would be able to conduct engineering activities in a
smooth manner using these heavy machinery and other
equipment even after the withdrawal of the Japanese unit.
These dedicated activities by the dispatched
engineering unit were highly appreciated and valued
by the UN and South Sudan. Personnel dispatches to

During December 2-8, 2017, I was dispatched to Peace Assistance Training Center located in the Federal Democratic Republic of
Ethiopia as the instructor on gender in a “confl ict prevention courses” with participation of about 30 trainees (military and civilian)
from African countries who are future PKO member candidates. I lectured to the trainees on “Introduction to Gender” and taught
them about the need to protect vulnerable gender groups during and after confl icts and have them participate in the policy decision
process in order to realize the PKO duty of civilian protection and the effi cacy of including a gender perspective in various activities
as a method.
This was Japan’s fi rst dispatch to a PKO Center in another country of someone from the Self Defense Forces as a gender
instructor. Despite feeling considerable pressure and uncertainty ahead of the course, I enjoyed the instruction, including laughter,
after coming into contact with enthusiastic trainees.
Gender mainstreaming is one of the issues in security situations receiving the most attention in the United Nations and globally.
It is also a topic that should be covered in participation of Self Defense Forces in international peace cooperation activities and other
initiatives. I believe it should be actively promoted to ensure that PKO members from various countries effectively carry out their
duties with a gender perspective.

3 International Disaster Relief Operations


In recent years, the role of military affairs has become
more diverse, and opportunities for military to use their
capabilities in humanitarian assistance and disaster
relief are growing. To contribute to the advancement
of international cooperation, the SDF has also engaged
in international disaster relief operations proactively
from the viewpoint of humanitarian contributions and
improvement of the global security environment.
To this end, the SDF maintains their readiness to
take any necessary action based on prepared disaster
relief operation plans. In consultation with the Minister
of Foreign Affairs, the SDF has been proactively
conducting international disaster relief operations,
which fully utilize their functions and capabilities, while
taking into consideration specifi c relief requests by the
governments of affected countries and disaster situations
in these countries.

SDF and SDF’s Posture


Responding to specifi c relief requests by the governments
of affected countries and the scale of disaster situations
in these countries, the SDF’s capabilities in international
disaster relief operations encompass (1) medical services,
such as fi rst-aid medical treatment and epidemic
prevention; (2) transport of relief items, patients and
personnel by helicopter and other means; and (3) water
supply activities using water-purifying devices. In
addition, the SDF uses transport aircraft and ships to
carry disaster relief personnel and equipment to the
affected area.
The Ground Component Command and regional
units of the GSDF and other relevant GSDF units
maintain their readiness to ensure that they can carry out
international disaster relief operations in an independent
manner anytime when needed. The Self Defense Fleet of
the MSDF and Air Support Command of the ASDF also
constantly maintain their readiness to transport personnel
and their supplies to disaster affected areas. Furthermore,
in April 2015, the MOD/SDF also improved its readiness
to be able to swiftly respond to a request for search
activities using P-3C patrol aircraft.

**Section 4** **[Initiatives for Arms Control, Disarmament and ]**
**Non-Proliferation**


The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs)
and missiles, which serve as their means of delivery, pose a
pressing challenge to peace and stability of the international
community. Moreover, many countries are working on the
regulation of certain conventional weapons, considering
the need to maintain a balance between humanitarian
perspectives and defensive requirements.


One of the initiatives to deal with these issues is
the development of an international framework for arms
control, disarmament, and non-proliferation, and Japan is
playing an active role in this effort.

[See] Fig. III-2-4-1 (Framework for Arms Control, Disarmament and

[See]

Non- Proliferation Relating to Conventional Weapons, Weapons
of Mass Destruction, Missiles and Related Materials, etc.)


1 Initiatives Focused on Treaties Relating to Arms Control, Disarmament, and Non-Proliferation


Japan actively participates in international initiatives
for arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation in
regard to WMDs, in the form of nuclear, chemical, and
biological weapons, as well as missiles as a means of
delivery and associated technologies and materials.
Japan has contributed to the Chemical Weapons
Convention (CWC) by offering its knowledge in the
fi eld of chemical protection since the negotiating stage
and dispatching GSDF personnel who are experts on
protection against chemical weapons to the Organization
for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which
was established to continuously implement verifi cation
measures following the entry of the CWC into force. In
addition, small quantities of the chemical substances under
the regulation of the CWC are synthesized at the GSDF
Chemical School (Saitama City), in order to conduct
protection research. Thus, the school has undergone
inspections ten times in total since its establishment, in
accordance with the CWC regulations.
Moreover, the whole of the Japanese Government is


also working on projects aimed at disposing of abandoned
chemical weapons in China, in accordance with the CWC.
The MOD/SDF has seconded eleven personnel, including
GSDF personnel, to the Cabinet Offi ce to work on this
project, and since 2000, GSDF personnel with expertise
in chemicals and ammunitions have been dispatched to
conduct excavation and recovery projects on a total of 17
occasions. In addition, the MOD has been cooperating
in endeavors aimed at increasing the effectiveness of
regulations and decisions, by dispatching MOD offi cials
to major meetings such as those of the Biological Weapons
Convention (BWC), as well as international export control
regimes in the form of the Australia Group (AG) and the
Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). At the
same time, SDF personnel were dispatched to training to
foster substitute inspectors[1] provided by the Preparatory
Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban
Treaty Organization (CTBTO).

Japan has signed various conventions on the
regulation of conventional weapons such as the
Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of
Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed
to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate
Effects (CCW),[2] based on humanitarian perspectives
and security needs. In addition, Japan has signed the
Convention on Cluster Munitions (Oslo Convention),[3]
which was adopted outside the framework of the CCW.
With the entry of this Convention, the disposal of all
cluster munitions possessed by the SDF was completed
in February 2015.
The Ministry dispatches personnel to government
expert meetings related to Lethal Autonomous
Weapon Systems (LAWS) and other events under the


CCW framework.
Furthermore, the MOD has actively cooperated in
the initiatives of the international community that focus
on the problem of anti-personnel mines by submitting
annual reports that include data on Japan’s exceptional
stocks to the UN.
In addition, the MOD/SDF participates in the UN
Register of Conventional Arms, the UN Report on
Military Expenditures and other meetings related to
Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) with the purpose of increasing
the transparency of military preparedness and military
expenditure, and provides the requisite reports. It also
dispatches personnel as needed to governmental expert
meetings and other meetings for reviewing and improving
these systems.


2 International Initiatives Aimed at Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction


Deeply concerned about the development of WMDs
and missiles by countries such as North Korea and Iran,
the United States announced its Proliferation Security
Initiative (PSI)[4] in May 2003, and sought the participation
of other countries therein. Various initiatives are being
undertaken based on PSI; PSI interdiction exercises
aimed at improving the ability to thwart the proliferation
of WMDs and related items and meetings to consider
issues on policies and legislations.
Since the 3rd PSI Meeting in Paris (September 2003),
the MOD/SDF has collaborated with relevant organizations
and countries, dispatching MOD offi cials and SDF
personnel to various meetings, as well as engaging in
ongoing participation in these exercises since 2004.
The MOD/SDF has participated in PSI maritime
interdiction exercises, hosted by Japan, twice, working in
partnership with relevant organizations such as the Ministry


of Foreign Affairs, the National Police Agency, the Ministry
of Finance and the Japan Coast Guard, and also participated
in the PSI air interdiction exercise in July 2012, which
Japan hosted for the fi rst time. Recently, Japan participated
in Pacifi c Protector 17, a PSI maritime prevention exercise
organized by Australia, in September 2017 and trained
in activities to prevent the spread of weapons of mass
destruction with other participating countries.
Based on the proliferation cases in the areas
surrounding Japan, and from the perspectives of
preventing the proliferation of WMDs and improving the
response capability of the SDF, the MOD/SDF strives
to strengthen non-proliferation frameworks including
PSI, as well as holding various relevant exercises and
meetings and participating in the same kind of activities
which other countries hold.

the SDF)

For this reason, the MOD/SDF holds recruiting
meetings at schools and also maintains Provincial
Cooperation Offi ces in 50 locations throughout Japan
to respond to the individual needs of applicants, with
the understanding of educators and support from
recruitment counselors. Moreover, local governments
are also carrying out some of the administrative activities
regarding the recruitment of uniformed SDF personnel
and candidates for uniformed SDF personnel, such as
announcing the recruitment period and promoting the
SDF as a workplace, for which the MOD allocates them
the requisite budget.


1 Recruitment


It is vital to secure highly qualifi ed personnel for the
MOD/SDF to carry out various missions appropriately.
Expectations from the public for the MOD/SDF have
continued to rise. In Japan, however, due to the recent
economic and employment upturn, as well as the
advancement of declining birthrate and popularization
of higher education, the environment surrounding the
recruitment of uniformed SDF personnel is severe. In
such a situation, it is necessary for the MOD/SDF to
recruit excellent human resources with a strong desire
to enlist, by explaining suffi ciently to them the missions,
roles, duties, and working conditions of the SDF.

Notes: 1. Staff candidates for the medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy faculties will be promoted to the position of First Lieutenant if they pass the national examinations in medicine.
2. Student candidates for enlistment (upper) refers to a candidate who has been appointed as an officer with the premise that he/she will be promoted to a fixed-term position of “Enlisted (upper).”

Until FY2006, there were two programs consisting of “Student candidates for enlistment (upper)” and “Enlisted (upper) candidates.” However, these two programs were reorganized and combined,
and since 2007, candidates have been appointed as “General candidates for enlistment (upper).”

3. As for the SDF candidates, in order to enhance the initial education of SDF personnel in short-term service, in July 2010, it was decided that their status for the first three months of their

enlistment would be as non-SDF personnel, and they would engage exclusively in fundamental education and practice as non-regular Ministry of Defense personnel.

4. GSDF High Technical School trains people to be SDF personnel who will be capable not only of operating and making full use of equipment in the GSDF but also of conducting missions in the

international community. For SDF students, starting from FY2010 appointments, their status was changed from SDF officer to “students,” which is a new non-regular status. New students receive a
high school diploma at the conclusion of a student course (three years) through distance learning. From the FY2011 appointments, a new recommendation system was introduced in which those
who are considered appropriate to be a GSDF High Technical School student are selected from among the candidates based on the recommendation of the principal of their junior high school etc.,
in addition to the conventional general examination.

5. A three-year program ended in FY2013. A new four-year program was established at the National Defense Medical College, Faculty of Nursing in 2014.
6. For student airmen, the Maritime Self-Defense Force selects from persons 18 or above and under 23 in age and the Air Defense Force 18 or above and under 21 in age.


2 Employment

**(1) Uniformed SDF personnel**
Based on a voluntary system that respects individuals’
free will, uniformed SDF personnel are recruited under
various categories.

[See] Fig. III-3-1-2 (Overview of Appointment System for SDF Personnel)

Due to the uniqueness of their duties, personnel
management of uniformed SDF personnel differs from
that of general civilian government employees,[1] including
“Early Retirement System” and “Fixed Term System” to
maintain the SDF’s strength.
After employment, uniformed SDF personnel are
assigned their branch of service and duties at units all
around Japan, in accordance with their choice or aptitude,
following basic education and training at respective
training units or schools of respective SDF services.

**(2) SDF Reserve Personnel, SDF Ready Reserve**
**Personnel, and Candidates for SDF Reserve Personnel**

It is essential to secure the required number of uniformed
SDF personnel promptly depending on situational
changes in the event of a crisis. To secure the required
number promptly and systematically, the MOD maintains
the following three systems: the SDF Reserve Personnel
system, the SDF Ready Reserve Personnel system, and
the Candidates for SDF Reserve Personnel system.[2]

[See] Fig. III-3-1-4 (Overview of Systems Related to SDF Reserve

[See]

Personnel)

SDF Reserve Personnel become uniformed SDF
personnel upon the issuance of a defense call-up order
or other orders, and carry out logistical support and base
guard duties. SDF Ready Reserve Personnel become
uniformed SDF personnel and are assigned to carry out
their mission together with incumbent uniformed SDF
personnel as part of frontline units following the issuance
of a defense call-up order or other orders. SDF Reserve
Personnel candidates, some of whom are recruited
among those with no prior experience as uniformed SDF

VOICE Companies Supporting Self Defense Force Reserve Personnel

and Others (Cooperating Site for SDF Reserve Personnel and Others)[COLUMN]

Muneo Taniguchi, Representative Director & Chairman, Nara Kotsu Bus Lines Co., Ltd.
(Chairman of the SDF Ready Reserve Personnel Employment Cooperating Company Association

Our company has built a variety of businesses around the mainstay bus operation primarily in Nara Prefecture, including restaurants,
real estate, and other related businesses, with a theme of “safe and reliable Nara Kotsu” since its establishment through a merger
during the war years in 1943.
It has actively hired retiring uniformed Self Defense Force personnel for many years, totaling over 100 people thus far. The
company currently has two SDF Ready Reserve Personnel and nine SDF Reserve Personnel.
Uniformed SDF personnel join our company with a solid sense of responsibility, enthusiasm, and strong psychological wherewithal.
Many are both serious-minded and disciplined. They provide a model for other employees and help invigorate the workplace.
Furthermore, uniformed SDF personnel play a major role in social contribution, such as international peace cooperation operation
and disaster responses. I believe that hiring many retiring uniformed SDF personnel enhances enterprise value as well.
The company is honored to have received Minister of Defense certifi cation as a “cooperating site for Self Defense Force Reserve
Personnel and others.” We intend to pursue hiring of retired uniformed SDF personnel even more actively than in past years and hope to
serve as a bridge between the Self Defense Forces and local society and contribute to advances in society through our business efforts.

personnel, are appointed as SDF Reserve Personnel after
completing the necessary education and training.
Previously, it was stipulated that SDF Reserve
Personnel and SDF Ready Reserve Personnel who
received a disaster and other call-up orders[3] would begin
their service as SDF personnel fi ve days or later (ten days
in the case of a defense call-up order for SDF Reserve
Personnel) after the issuance of the order. However, based
on the performance of calling up the SDF Ready Reserve
Personnel in response to the Kumamoto Earthquake in
2016,[4] the Order for Enforcement of the SDF Law was
partially revised in August 2016 to make it possible to
shorten the number of days, provided that those personnel
have no objection.
As SDF Reserve Personnel and others work in their
civilian jobs under normal circumstances, they need to
adjust their work schedule to participate in periodic training
exercises. Therefore, understanding and cooperation from
the companies that employ these personnel are essential
for the smooth operation of the systems.
For this purpose, the MOD provides a special
subsidy to the companies that employ SDF Ready


SDF Ready Reserve Personnel engaging in their tasks, responding to the call-up order for
the heavy rainfall disaster in July 2018

Reserve Personnel and take necessary measures to allow
such employees to attend training sessions for 30 days
a year, by taking into consideration the burden on such
companies. Also, the MOD issues special certifi cates[5] to
companies that create an environment for SDF Reserve
Personnel they employ to participate in training sessions.
Moreover, the MOD takes various measures to gain
understanding and cooperation from the companies that


The call-up orders refer to the defense call-up order, civil protection call-up order, and disaster call-up order for SDF Reserve Personnel as well as the defense call-up order, civil protection call-up
order, security call-up order, and disaster call-up order for SDF Ready Reserve Personnel; they do not include the training call-up orders for SDF Reserve Personnel and SDF Ready Reserve Personnel.

In response to the Kumamoto Earthquake in 2016, a call-up order for SDF Ready Reserve Personnel was issued for the second time in the SDF’s history, and 162 Ready Reserve Personnel engaged
in activities such as livelihood support to the affected people. In this case, a considerable number of the SDF Ready Reserve Personnel who had received the call-up order arrived at their respective
SDF units prior to the date they were supposed to appear.

A system for recognizing companies that cooperate with the SDF Reserve Personnel program was introduced in FY2015. In that fi scal year, the directors of Provincial Cooperation Offi ces gave out
certifi cations and issued special certifi cates to those companies. In FY2016, the Minister of Defense gave out certifi cations. The certifi ed companies are listed on the websites of the MOD and the

employ SDF Reserve Personnel. For example, the MOD
has been developing a framework that allows the MOD/
SDF to provide such information as the scheduled term of
a training call-up and scheduled term that SDF Reserve
Personnel are called up to perform actual operations
and are appointed as uniformed SDF personnel, when
requested by their employers. In addition, the MOD
has established a new system where the employers are
provided with a subsidy if (1) SDF Reserve Personnel
or SDF Ready Reserve Personnel respond to a defense
operation call-up order, civil protection dispatch call-up
order, or disaster relief call-up order, etc. or (2) if they
have no choice but to leave their regular occupations due
to injuries during their duties, etc. in order to contribute
to securing understanding and cooperation of the duties.
Also, the MOD promotes the use of SDF Reserve
Personnel in a wide range of fi elds, such as the appointment
of retired SDF pilots, who are to be reemployed in the
private sector, to SDF Reserve Personnel through the
reemployment system.[6]

**(3) Administrative Offi cials, Technical and Engineering**
**Offi cials, Instructors, and Other Civilian Personnel**

There are approximately 21,000 civilian personnel
— administrative offi cials, technical and engineering
offi cials, instructors, and others[7] — in addition to
uniformed SDF personnel in the MOD/SDF. Civilian
personnel are mainly recruited from those who have
passed the Recruitment Examination for Comprehensive


and General Service National Public Employees
conducted by the National Personnel Authority (NPA),
and those who have passed the Recruitment Examination
for Ministry of Defense Specialists conducted by the
MOD. After participating in the common training course,
civilian personnel recruited in this process work in a wide
range of fi elds.
Administrative offi cials are engaged in defenserelated policy planning in the Internal Bureaus of the
MOD and at the Acquisition, Technology and Logistics
Agency (ATLA); analysis and evaluation at the Defense
Intelligence Headquarters; and administrative works at
the SDF bases, the Regional Defense Bureaus, and other
locations throughout the country.
Technical and engineering offi cials are working in the
Internal Bureaus of the MOD, ATLA, the SDF bases, the
Regional Defense Bureaus, and other locations throughout
the country. They are engaged in constructing various
defense facilities (headquarters, runways, magazines, etc.),
carrying out R&D, effi cient procurement, maintenance and
improvement of a range of equipment, as well as providing
mental health care for SDF personnel.
Instructors conduct advanced research on defense
and provide high-quality education to SDF personnel at
the National Institute for Defense Studies, the National
Defense Academy, the National Defense Medical
College, and other organizations.

[See] Reference 61 (Breakdown of Ministry of Defense Personnel, etc.)

professional knowledge and skills, or that it is diffi cult
for them to acquire such knowledge and skills within the
SDF, the MOD/SDF commissions education to external
institutions, including those abroad, as well as domestic
companies and research institutes.


2 Daily Education and Training


1 Education of Uniformed SDF Personnel

Enhancing the ability of the individual uniformed
SDF personnel who comprise SDF units is essential
for the execution of the units’ duties. For this purpose,
the respective SDF training units and schools provide
opportunities for phased and systematic education
according to rank and duties to nurture necessary qualities
and instill knowledge and skills.
A considerable extent of human, temporal, and
economic efforts such as securing instructors with
special skills, and improving equipment and educational
facilities, are necessary for providing education. In
the event that personnel need to further improve their


2 SDF Training

**(1) Training by Each SDF**
Training conducted by units in each service can be
broadly divided into training for individual SDF
personnel to improve the necessary profi ciency for
their respective fi elds, and training for units to enhance
their systematic capabilities. Training for individuals is


The reemployment system for SDF pilots aims to prevent the outfl ow of active young SDF pilots to civil aviation companies in an unregulated manner. This system is also designed to utilize SDF pilots
over a certain age as pilots of commercial airlines, and is also signifi cant from the perspective of the development of the airline industry in Japan as a whole.

Among the employees of the MOD, special national government employees are called” SDF personnel,” which include administrative offi cials, technical and engineering offi cials, instructors, and others


-----

Newly joined members of the GSDF, MSDF, and ASDF conducting basic training


conducted one-on-one in stages based on occupational
classifi cation and individual ability. Training for units
is conducted depending on the size of unit, from small
to large; meanwhile, large-scale comprehensive training
including coordination between units is also conducted.
In addition to training for national defense, the
MOD is endeavoring to improve training corresponding
to the diversifi ed SDF roles required in recent years,
such as peacekeeping operations and large-scale disaster
relief operations. Moreover, in order to strengthen
joint operational capabilities and to respond to various
situations, the MOD is making efforts to widen the scope
of joint exercises and bilateral and multilateral exercises
participated by the individual SDF services.[8]

[See] Reference 62 (Major Exercises Conducted in FY2017)

[See]


**(2) Training Environment**
SDF training has been planned and conducted under
conditions that are as close as possible to actual combat
situations, yet many restrictions remain. Therefore, the SDF
makes maximum use of its limited domestic training areas,
including further use of the prime training environment
of Hokkaido stated in the National Defense Program
Guidelines (NDPG) and other guidelines. They also strive
to carry out more practical combat training by conducting


joint exercises and other training and exercises in the United
States and surrounding sea and airspace where they can
secure training conditions not available in Japan.

[See] Reference 63 (Results of Firing Training and Related Training

[See]

by Dispatch of Each of the Self-Defense Forces to the United
States (FY2017))


3 Initiatives to Prevent Accidents, etc.


Any accident that can cause injury to the public, damage
to its property, or the loss of life of SDF personnel,
must be avoided at all costs. Therefore, the MOD/SDF
constantly strive as one for safety management such as
implementing the highest level of safety measures and
precautions during routine training. Despite these efforts,
in August 2017, an SH-60J helicopter, assigned to the
MSDF destroyer Setogiri, fell into the sea to the west of
Tappizaki, Aomori Prefecture during a training fl ight and
three members lost their lives on duty. Furthermore, in
October 2017, a UH-60J helicopter, which belongs to the
ASDF Hamamatsu Air Base (Shizuoka Prefecture) fell
into the Pacifi c Ocean to the south of Hamamatsu City,
Shizuoka Prefecture during a training fl ight and four
members lost their lives on duty.
In February 2018, an AH-64D helicopter belonging
to the GSDF Camp Metabaru (Saga Prefecture) fell
and crashed into a civilian house in Kanzaki City, Saga
Prefecture, doing major damage to the local community
including injury of one resident, fi re on three buildings and
damages to the buildings surrounding the crash site, as
well as losing two SDF personnel on duty. Following the
incident, the MOD/SDF has been committed to providing
psychological care and compensation for damages for the
people affected by it so they can return to their daily life
as soon as possible. The Aircraft Accident Investigation
Committee established in the GSDF has been taking special
measures by allowing civilian experts in aeronautical
engineering etc. to participate in this investigation and an
interim report[9] was released in May 2018.

includes International Peace Cooperation Exercises that assumes SDF’s international peace cooperation activities and Joint International Humanitarian Operation Training, in which the treatment of
prisoners of war and other detainees is practiced.


-----

It is greatly regretted that incidents such as these
have occurred as they compromise safety of the residents
in the regions, cause anxiety to the wide public regarding
the SDF’s operation and trainings and puts the lives of
SDF personnel at risk. The MOD/SDF as a whole is


making its utmost effort to prevent recurrence of such
accidents by thoroughly investigating the causes of
them and making sure each member has recognized the
importance of safety management once again.


3 Measures Aimed at Ensuring Effective Use of Human Resources


is also actively working to develop a family support system
to be implemented in the event of large-scale natural
disasters and other events, which will include receiving
cooperation in confi rming the safety of the family members
of SDF personnel. All of these are conducted as routine
initiatives. Furthermore, specifi c welfare services for SDF
personnel deployed overseas include facilitating direct
communication with their families in Japan by means
such as e-mail and video conference systems. Support for
sending comfort items from their families at a later date
is also provided. Moreover, briefi ng sessions for families
of the dispatched SDF personnel are held to provide them
with a variety of information, and a consultation desk
exclusively for families of the dispatched SDF personnel
(family support centers), a website for the families of the
dispatched SDF personnel and similar facilities have been
established to provide consolation for the various questions
and concerns raised by the families.


Measures for Personnel System Reform and for
1
the Improvement of Pay and Conditions

With regard to the personnel structure of the SDF, the
fi xed number of SDF personnel has been constantly
reduced. On the other hand, there has been the need
for further skilled and professional personnel in order
to respond to the advancement of equipment as well as
diversifi cation and internationalization of SDF missions.
In light of such circumstances, it is stated in the
NDPG that measures are to be implemented with regard to
personnel system reform in order to ensure the robustness
of the SDF and to make effective use of human resources
under the constrained budget.
Furthermore, due to the harsh environmental
circumstances under which uniformed SDF personnel
have to perform their duties, the MOD/SDF strives to
provide salaries, allowances, welfare and other benefi ts
that refl ect the special nature of their duties in order to let
uniformed SDF personnel concentrate on their duties with
pride, relieved of anxiety. The MOD/SDF also promotes
measures relating to awards and honors, beginning with the
expansion of the system of Defense Meritorious Badges.


Dealing with Retirement and Re-Employment of
3
SDF Personnel


In order to maintain the strength of the SDF, many
uniformed SDF personnel retire in their mid-50s
(personnel serving under the early retirement system)
or in their 20s (most uniformed SDF personnel serving
under the fi xed-term service system). Therefore, many of
them need to fi nd another job after retirement in order to
secure their livelihoods.


2 Initiatives to Support Families

In addition to exchanges between units and personnel’s
families, as well as between the families, the MOD in
cooperation with relevant external groups and organizations

Since supporting re-employment is the responsibility
of the Japanese Government (the MOD) as the employer,
and is crucially important both for resolving any concerns
that uniformed SDF personnel may have about their future
as well as for securing qualifi ed human resources, the MOD
conducts support measures such as occupational training
useful for their re-employment. The measures to support
the re-employment of retired uniformed SDF personnel
is also important from the perspective of enabling them
to give back to society with their various skills, thereby
reinforcing human resources infrastructure.
As the MOD does not have the authority to provide
them with employment placement, the Foundation for
the SDF Personnel Support Association provides free job
consultation services with permission from the Minister
of Health, Labor and Welfare and the Minister of Land,
Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.
Retired uniformed SDF personnel have excellent
abilities in planning, leadership, faculty, cooperativeness
and responsibility gained through their work performance,
education, and training. Furthermore, they have various
qualifi cations and licenses acquired through their duties
and vocational training. Therefore, they are making
positive contributions in a broad range of sectors,
including manufacturing and service industries, as
well as fi nance, insurance, real estate, and construction
industries, in addition to the areas of disaster prevention
and risk management at local governments. Based on
the NDPG, the MOD has promoted further utilization of
retired uniformed SDF personnel in the areas of disaster
prevention and crisis management at local governments,
and has provided supports for these retired personnel’s
re-employment in the sectors that lack suffi cient human
resources in collaboration with relevant ministries and
agencies. The MOD will make further efforts to improve
the re-employment environment for retired SDF personnel.

Personnel in Disaster Prevention-related Bureaus in Local Government)

For the purpose of ensuring an environment where

duties without any concerns, the MOD allows uniformed
SDF personnel after mandatory retirement to be reappointed
for fi xed terms within three years before the age of 60 (one
year for SDF administration offi cials and others). The MidTerm Defense Program (MTDP) states that the SDF will
actively reappoint retiring personnel possessing advanced
knowledge, skills and experience where such personnel
prove benefi cial to the SDF’s strength.
Meanwhile, with regard to the re-employment of
SDF personnel, new regulations about re-employment
were introduced in October 2015 replacing the former
prior approval system. As are the cases in other national
government employees, the following three regulations
were put in place in order to ensure the trust of the public
regarding the fairness of offi cial duties: 1) regulation on
requesting re-employment of other personnel and retired
personnel and requesting information; 2) regulation
on seeking employment opportunities at companies
in which retired personnel had a stake whilst in offi ce;
and 3) regulation on re-employed personnel making
requests.[10] In order to ensure strict observation of these
regulations, bodies comprised of academic experts with
no history serving as SDF members (Defense Personnel
Review Board’s Separate Meeting for Monitoring
Reemployment and Cabinet Offi ce’s Reemployment
Surveillance Commission) monitor the situation and
any violation will be met with penalties. Additionally,
for the purpose of appropriate implementation of
unifi ed management and disclosure of re-employment
information by institutionalizing notifi cation and
announcement of such information by the Cabinet, it
has been decided that information on the re-employment
status of retired SDF personnel who were in managerial
positions (equivalent to the position of Senior Coordinator
in the MOD or higher) is to be published every fi scal year
by the Cabinet. In response to the introduction of this
system in FY2015, notifi cations of re-employment of the
retired SDF personnel who were in managerial positions
submitted during FY2016 were compiled, and a total of
203 cases were offi cially announced in September 2017.

ability on duty, it is essential to achieve support and trust
from the public. To this end, the SDF is required to always
maintain strong discipline.
The MOD/SDF has so far strived to foster well

1 Initiatives to Maintain Strong Discipline

The MOD/SDF has gained great expectations from the
public and in order for the SDF to perform its maximum

disciplined personnel by impressing in them an
awareness of compliance with the law through setting up
such campaign periods as the “MOD Anti-Drug Abuse
Month,” “Self-Defense Forces Personnel Ethics Week,”
“Self-Defense Personnel Sexual Harassment Prevention
Week,” and “Self-Defense Personnel Power Harassment
Prevention Week” and implemented various measures
such as thorough instructions on service discipline.
However, the number of personnel subjected
to disciplinary action has remained high and taking
measures to eradicate violation of the law has become
a pressing issue in order to achieve support and trust
from the public. Based on this situation, in October 2017,
Minister of Defense Onodera issued the “Instructions of
the Minister of Defense toward Eradication of Violation
of the Law,” which included strengthening disciplinary
action and expediting the administrative process of
disciplinary action as the pillars. Thus, the MOD is
proceeding with its effort to eradicate violation of the law.
Over the last few years, in addition to the daily report
issues related to the South Sudan PKO[11] and the daily
report issues related to Iraq,[12] the MOD/SDF has faced
issues such as uniformed SDF personnel’s inappropriate
remarks toward diet members.[13] Amid a situation
where the security environment surrounding Japan is
extremely severe, it is necessary to gain understanding
and cooperation from the public, perform its duty and
respond to the expectations from the public in order to
maintain the nation’s peace and security. The MOD/SDF
will make its utmost effort to prevent recurrence of such
issues with the aim of recovering trust from the public.


the MOD/SDF in terms of the loss of capable personnel,
and the MOD/SDF is taking ongoing measures to prevent
suicides, including the following initiatives: (1) Expansion
and enhancement of the counseling system (internal/
external counselors, a 24-hour telephone counseling
hotline, assignment of clinical psychotherapists at camps
and bases, etc.); (2) Strengthening of education to raise
awareness about mental health for commanders as well as
enlisted personnel; and (3) Establishment of a campaign
period for enhancing mental health care, close monitoring
by commanders of the mental health condition of their
subordinates whose working environment has been
changed due to personnel transfers, etc., and distribution
of various reference materials.


Commemorating Personnel who Perished in
3
the Line of Duty


Since the establishment of the National Police Reserve
in 1950 and through its evolution via the National Safety
Force and the Coastal Safety Force into the SDF today,
SDF personnel have been striving to accomplish the noble
mission of protecting the peace and independence of
Japan. They have been devoting themselves unstintingly
to training, day and night, to live up to the expectations
and trust of Japanese citizens, regardless of danger, and
with a strong sense of responsibility. During this time
period, however, more than 1,900 personnel have lost
their lives in the line of duty.
In the MOD/SDF, funeral ceremonies in order
to express condolences are carried out by each unit to
which the personnel who perished in the line of duty
belonged. Moreover, in order to eternally recognize the
achievements of the SDF personnel who perished in the
line of duty, and to express deep honor and condolences,
memorial ceremonies are carried out in various forms,
such as the Memorial Service for members of the SDF
personal who lost their lives in the line of duty conducted
with the participation of the Prime Minister.[14]


2 Initiatives to Prevent Suicide among SDF Personnel


SDF personnel suicides was a record 101 in FY2005,
and have subsequently increased and decreased, with 90
suicides in FY2017. The suicide of SDF members is truly
a great tragedy for both the individuals themselves and
their bereaved families. It also represents a great loss to

with other monuments located in the same area. The MOD holds an annual memorial ceremony for SDF personnel who perished in the line of duty with the attendance of surviving family members,
the Prime Minister, high-ranking offi cials of the MOD/SDF including the Minister of Defense, former Defense Ministers, and others. At the Monument for SDF Personnel who Perished in the Line of

**Section 2** **[Promotion of Work-Life Balance and More Active ]**
**Participation of Female Personnel**


The security environment surrounding Japan has become
increasingly severe, and both the number and the duration
of situations requiring the MOD/SDF’s commitment are
increasing. On the other hand, it is anticipated that a
rising number of MOD staff, both male and female, who
deal with such situations will face time constraints due to
childcare, nursing care and other reasons.
Amid such challenging circumstances, ensuring
preparedness to consistently respond to various situations
requires creating an environment that enables staff to
be sound both mentally and physically, maintain high
morale, and fully demonstrate their abilities. On the
basis of this view, the MOD/SDF promotes initiatives to

1 Working Style Reform


achieve work-life balance of its staff members.
Also, the MOD/SDF has been proactively encouraging
the active participation of female personnel, and the
number of female personnel is on the rise.
The MOD/SDF has been conducting a variety of
initiatives in order to promote work-life balance and the
further expansion of the recruitment and promotion of
female personnel in a unifi ed manner, such as formulating
various plans[1] that include three reforms: (1) working
style reform; (2) reform to combine a successful career
with childrearing and nursing care; and (3) reform for
promoting active engagement of female personnel.

of Defense respectively honored particularly excellent
initiatives, out of the applications received from various
organizations, and used them to help achieve work
reform of each workplace.


**(1) Value and Mentality Reform**
In order to implement working style reform, a focus
needs to be placed especially on reforming the values
and mentality of staff in managerial positions regarding
working style. In FY2017, the MOD/SDF carried out
educational initiatives such as seminars and lecture
meetings for raising awareness concerning working style
reform and the concept of work-life balance. The MOD/
SDF also implements the “Take more annual leave”
promotional campaign to encourage staff to take a longer
leave during holiday seasons, with an intention to reform
values related to working style.

**(2) Work Reform in the Workplace**
It is important that initiatives for the promotion of worklife balance are appropriate for the actual circumstances
of individual workplaces, and that staff members
themselves consider specifi c measures for improving
their workplace environment. This approach will lead to
developing effective initiatives and workplace climate.
Based on this perspective, during the campaign period
for enhancing work-life balance from June to September
2017, the “Competition for initiatives to promote
Working Style Reform at the Ministry of Defense” was
held. The Minister of Defense and the State Minister


**(3) Flexible Working Hours and Location**
Realizing more fl exible working hours and work locations
is necessary in light of factors such as operational
fl uctuations and time constraints faced by individuals.
For this reason, the MOD/SDF introduced the fl extime
system in 2016 and enabled its staff to choose fl exible
working hours by dividing early/late shifts into multiple

periods. In addition, telework, a work style that allows
working at home has become available in the Internal
Bureau of the MOD in FY2017 after two years of test
introduction from FY2015. Organizations other than


the Internal Bureau of the MOD aim to begin adopting
this work system from FY2019 and are steadily making
preparation by beginning to pilot the system.


2 Reform to Combine a Successful Career with Childrearing and Nursing Care


In order for MOD/SDF staff, both male and female, to
be successful in their careers while realizing work-life
balance, it is necessary to establish a system that enables
balancing work with childrearing/nursing care, and to
ensure childcare services tailored to the irregular working
patterns unique to the SDF.

**(1) Development of an Environment that Enables Staff**
**to Realize a Successful Career While Engaging in**
**Childrearing and Nursing Care**

The MOD/SDF has developed various schemes, which
enable staff to balance work with childrearing/nursing
care, such as ensuring substitute personnel for staff who
take childcare leave and other leaves. In particular, the


ministry is encouraging its male staff to take childcare
leave to promote their participation in family life.
The MOD/SDF is also developing an environment
that enables staff to balance work life with their family life
by distributing e-mail newsletters to help its staff to return
to work smoothly after childcare leave and encouraging
staff to use a “childcare form” to facilitate managers’ and
the human resources department’s thorough and detailed
understanding of the situation regarding childcare.
The MOD/SDF has a system to rehire SDF personnel
who have previously resigned mid-career. It reassessed the
system so that former SDF personnels who had resigned
in their mid-career due to childrearing and nursing care
could be reemployed from January 2017. Based on this


VOICE Feelings about working again as a Ground Self Defense Force member **[COLUMN]**

Western Army Medical Unit, First Lieutenant, Tomomi Ikezaki

I joined the Ground Self Defense Force(GSDF) in 1993 as an offi cer candidate and worked as a treatment platoon leader in the
medical division, but in 1999, in my mid-career, I quitted in order to take care of my fi rst daughter. After it, I raised my three children
and worked as a care welfare specialist at the same time. My husband, an active member of the Self Defense Forces(SDF), told
me about the renewed hiring program for former SDF members. I had not been thinking about coming back to the GSDF at all.
Nevertheless, the enthusiasm from my youthful years rekindled my motivation and I immediately decided to volunteer again. Receipt
of my appointment certifi cate after the interviews fi lled me with the same inspiration as when I fi rst joined the GSDF.
I began working as a GSDF offi cer again on the 1st January, 2018. There have been many things to learn and remember given
signifi cant changes in the environment surrounding the GSDF and its role since I left. While everyday was challenging, I felt that I
could be useful even after a blank of 18 years and was happy to be rehired. I greatly appreciate the support from my superiors, peers
and family, and will strive to become even more effective for my unit.

system, some previous Ground Seld Defense Force
personnels were recruited in January 2018.

**(2) Ensuring Childcare Services**
To allow SDF personnel who are rearing children to
concentrate on their duties, it is important to ensure
childcare services tailored to the irregular working
patterns unique to the SDF. Since April 2007, the MOD/
SDF has set up workplace nurseries at GSDF Camp
Mishuku, GSDF Camp Kumamoto, GSDF Camp
Makomanai, GSDF Asaka Camp dormitory district,


MSDF Yokosuka Naval Base district, and ASDF Iruma
Air Base, respectively. Additionally, in April 2017, a
workplace nursery was newly opened at Ichigaya district
where the MOD is located in April within National
Defense Medical College in October 2017.
In addition, in the event of emergency operations
such as disaster relief, the MOD promotes measures to
provide temporary care within SDF camps and bases for
children of SDF personnel who have no alternative but to
attend to duties with their children.


3 Reform for Promoting the Careers of Female Personnel


For the further expansion of the recruitment and promotion
of female personnel in a unifi ed manner, the MOD/SDF
has been making various efforts to advance the careers of
motivated and qualifi ed female personnel by setting up
specifi c goals with regard to the recruitment and promotion
of female personnel based on the “Action Plan for
Promoting the Active Participation of Female Employees
and Work-Life Balance.” Moreover, the MOD formulated
the “Initiative to Promote Active Engagement of Female
SDF Personnel – Aiming for Attractive SDF that Adapts
to the Times and Environment” (the “Initiative”) in April
2017 to specify its conceptual policy for promoting the
active participation of female SDF personnel.

**(1) Signifi cance of Promoting Active Engagement of Female**
**SDF Personnel and Personnel Management Policy**

The “Initiative” outlines the signifi cance of promoting the
active engagement of female personnel and the MOD/SDF
personnel management policy. Specifi cally, with SDF
duties becoming increasingly diverse and complex, SDF
personnel are required to have multifaceted capabilities
including higher levels of knowledge, decision-making
ability, and skills than before. In addition, under a severe
recruitment environment due to the declining birthrate
and greater advancement into higher education, it is
anticipated that the number of SDF personnel with time
restraint including those involved in childcare, nursing
care, and other responsibilities will signifi cantly increase.
In light of these changes, the SDF is required to evolve
from a conventional organization with an emphasis on


homogeneity among the members, into an organization
that is capable of incorporating diverse human resources
in a fl exible manner.
At the present moment, the largest human resource
that the SDF has not been able to fully utilize is women,
who account for half of the population targeted for
recruitment. Promoting the active engagement of female
SDF personnel has the following signifi cance: (1)
securing useful human resources; (2) utilizing diverse
perspectives; and (3) refl ecting values of the nation.
For this reason, the MOD/SDF has decided to open up
a path for female personnel with motivation, ability,
and aptitude to have opportunities to demonstrate their
abilities in various fi elds, and aim for doubling the ratio
of female SDF personnel.
In terms of employing and promoting female SDF
personnel, the MOD/SDF sets out a personnel management
policy to ensure equal opportunity between men and
women and assign the right person to the right place based
on the person’s motivation and ability/aptitude.

**(2) Removal of the Assignment Restriction of Female**
**SDF Personnel**

While the SDF has been accepting female SDF personnel
since its establishment in 1954, assignment of female
personnel had been restricted in some units, such as the
GSDF infantry companies and tank companies. However,
the Initiative, formulated in April 2017, virtually removed
the restriction on the assignment of female personnel
across the SDF.[2]


With regard to part of the GSDF NBC Weapon Defense Unit, the GSDF Tunnel Company, and MSDF submarines, the assignment restriction has not been removed due to reasons in relation to protecting
motherhood and the characteristics of the equipment.
Also, certain units such as GSDF rifl e platoons and tank platoons from which the assignment restriction has been removed, personnel will be assigned successively to the units whose preparation has

Note: As of the end of March 2018, the total number of female SDF personnel is 14,686 (approximately 6.5% of the total number of the current SDF personnel)


**(3) Expansion of the Recruitment of Female Personnel**
a. Female SDF Personnel
As of the end of March 2018, the number of female
SDF personnel is about 15,000 (about 6.5% of total SDF
personnel). Compared with ten years ago (end of March
2008, about 4.9% of total SDF personnel), this is a rise of
1.6 percentage point, indicating that the ratio of female
SDF personnel has been on the rise in recent years.
In order to increase the proportion of female SDF
personnel among total SDF personnel to over 9%
by 2030, the MOD/SDF plans to ensure that women
account for more than 10% of total newly employed SDF
personnel in and after FY2017. Specifi cally, the increase
in the number of female recruits will be realized by
measures such as the elimination of the gender quota and
the increase in the scheduled number of female recruits.
In addition, with regard to promotion, the proportion of
women among SDF personnel with a rank of fi eld offi cer
or higher will be increased from 3.1%. As for the careers
of the personnel anticipated to reach a rank of fi eld offi cer
or higher in the future, an emphasis is given on assigning
them to a commander or assistant commander post at the
rank of company offi cer, with the hope of allowing them
to gain experience.
Furthermore, in addition to these specifi c numerical
targets, the “Initiative” formulated in April 2017 indicates

personnel in the overall SDF personnel and halve the
mid-career retirement rate.

[See] Fig. III-3-2-1 (Trends in Incumbent Female SDF Personnel)

b. Female Administrative Offi cials, Technical and
Engineering Offi cials, Instructors, and Others
As of the end of March 2018, the number of female
civilian personnel - administrative offi cials, technical
and engineering offi cials, and instructors, and others

-  is approximately 3,200 (about 24.0% of total civilian
personnel). Compared with ten years ago (end of March
2008 when females made up 22.8% of the total civilian
personnel), this is a rise of 1.2 percentage point, indicating
that the ratio of female civilian personnel is on a rising
trend in recent years.
With regard to recruitment, in line with the overall
government target, the MOD has set up its goal of
ensuring that women account for over 30% of recruits in
and after FY2016. Regarding promotion, as a goal to be
achieved by the end of FY2020, the proportion of women
of the Division-Director level at local organizations and
Assistant-Division-Director level at the ministry proper
or equivalent should be approximately 5%, and the
proportion of women of the Division-Director level at the
ministry proper or equivalent should be approximately
2%, and the proportion of women of the Unit-Chief
level at the ministry proper or equivalent should be

**Section 3 Enhancement of Medical Functions**


For the SDF to perform its mission, SDF personnel must
remain in good health through appropriate management of
their health. Also, it is important that the SDF always seeks
to enhance its capabilities in military medicine, such as
fi rst aid capabilities for protecting the lives of the personnel
engaging in a variety of services as much as possible.
Under the circumstance where the SDF’s missions
are becoming more diverse and internationalized, it


is important to appropriately and accurately carry out
medical activities such as medical care in disaster relief
and international peace cooperation activities.
The MOD/SDF, therefore, is enhancing and
strengthening its capabilities in military medicine to be
able to appropriately carry out a variety of its missions,
including in response to various emergency events and
international peace cooperation activities.


1 SDF Hospitals as Hub Hospitals with Enhanced Functions


The role of SDF hospitals is to admit and treat injured SDF
personnel and other persons transported from their area of
activity in various emergency situations, while in normal
circumstances these hospitals provide medical care to
SDF personnel and their families, etc. These hospitals also
play the role of educational institutions that train medical
personnel and maintain and enhance their skills.
Based on the NDPG, etc., the MOD currently
aspires to establish a high-quality medical care system


through measures such as promoting the consolidation
of SDF hospitals with increased performance levels, by
reorganizing 16 SDF hospitals located nationwide into
roughly 10 locations to develop more effi cient and higherquality hospitals. For instance, MOD/SDF is promoting
enhancement of medical care by making some SDF
hospitals designated as secondary emergency medical
institutions by the local municipalities to welcome
emergency patients, etc.


2 Strengthening the Function of the National Defense Medical College


As the only educational institution for the training of
physicians as well as public health and registered nurses
under the jurisdiction of the MOD/SDF, the National
Defense Medical College plays the role of training and
producing the primary medical staff for the medical
activities of the SDF as well as maintaining and improving
their skills.
In such a situation, the NDPG, etc. states not only that
the MOD/SDF will establish an effi cient and high-quality
medical care system, including improved management
of the National Defense Medical College Hospital, but
also that the function of the National Defense Medical


College would be strengthened as the training and
research center for defense medicine. Based on these, the
MOD is strengthening the organizational structure of the
National Defense Medical College, enhancing its training
and research functions, and strengthening its cooperation
with all three branches of the SDF. Furthermore, the
National Defense Medical College conducts advanced
research on defense medicine by incorporating advanced
medical technology in order to utilize specialized medical
technology and to contribute to operation of SDF units as
well as education and research of the National Defense
Medical College.


3 Enhancement of Education of Medical Offi cers and Nurses


While greater abilities are required of personnel engaged
in medical care, such as medical offi cers, due to the
diversifi cation of missions, only 80% of the positions
have been fi lled in the case of medical offi cers in
particular. Such low suffi ciency is caused by medical
ffi l i th SDF f th j f


which is the lack of opportunity to engage in medical
training and practice. The MOD/SDF continues efforts to
implement various measures to prevent medical offi cers
from leaving the SDF by enhancing clinical education
after graduation from the National Defense Medical
C ll d th i tit ti ti i


-----

initiatives for ensuring more opportunities for medical
offi cers to engage in medical practice, helping them
acquire and improve specialized knowledge and skills in
areas such as infectious diseases, as well as increasing
their motivation for work.
Furthermore, with the aim of training and securing
high-quality public health/registered nurses, a fouryear “nursing course”[1] was established in the School of
Medicine at the National Defense Medical College in April


2014, which is training public health/registered nurses
who are capable of fully responding to the diversifi cation
of missions and the sophistication of medical technology.
The fi rst batch of students (109 students) graduated from
the College in March 2018.
Moreover, medical personnel and medical staff are
educated and trained at SDF hospitals, schools and other
relevant institutions so that the SDF can perform diverse
missions and missions under special circumstances.


4 Enhancement of First Aid Capabilities on the Frontline


Based on the NDPG and other guidelines stating that
the MOD “conducts a review on emergency medical
treatment on situational responses and improves fi rst aid
capabilities on the frontline,” the MOD/SDF has conducted
research on relevant initiatives taken by the U.S. Forces
and carried out reviews for appropriate and accurate
life-saving activities. For the purpose of deepening this
review, the “Committee on accurate life-saving for the
MOD/SDF fi rst aid activities on the frontline” comprised
of external experts, was held at the MOD in April 2015,
and a report[2] was prepared in September 2016 based on
the discussions in the Committee. The MOD/SDF is
working to develop a framework for providing maximum
protection for the lives of the personnel injured on the


frontline. Specifi cally, since 2017, the MOD commenced
specifi c education and training for SDF personnel who
are certifi ed as both Licensed Practical Nurses and
Emergency Life-Saving Technicians to acquire necessary
knowledge and skills, so that the SDF personnel with
these qualifi cations will be able to provide specialized
relief treatments[3] on the spot to SDF personnel who were
injured on the frontline, prior to their transfer to SDF
hospitals and other medical facilities. Those who have
completed this education and training curriculum have
been allocated to units as “Frontline Medics.”[4] The SDF
is also improving medical materials to be carried by the
“Frontline Medics.”


5 Improving the Capabilities to Deal With Infectious Diseases


In light of the response to the Ebola virus disease
outbreak in West Africa in 2014, the Ministerial Meeting
on Measures on Emerging Infectious Diseases was
established in September 2015 under close cooperation
among relevant administrative bodies, for the entire
government to advance effective and comprehensive
measures on infectious diseases that could be a global
threat. In the same month of the same year, a decision was
made on the Basic Guidelines for Strengthening Measures
on Emerging Infectious Diseases. This basic guideline
stipulates that, “The Government of Japan will promote
the improvement of the ability to address emerging
infectious diseases at the Ministry of Defense and the
Japan Self-Defense Forces by training human resources


who have expertise that is necessary to contribute to the
Japan Self-Defense Forces’ overseas activities and by
accelerating the establishment of a framework including
the National Defense Medical College.” In response to
this, the MOD/SDF conducts various reviews on the
enhancement of capabilities to respond to infectious
diseases, a potential global threat. Based on these reviews
as well as other factors, the MOD/SDF is currently
improving the necessary facility equipment at the National
Defense Medical College Hospital and the SDF Central
Hospital. The aims of this improvement are to provide
personnel training for the enhancement of capabilities
to deal with infectious diseases and develop readiness
for offering medical treatment to patients affected by


The nursing course consists of two training courses: one for fostering SDF offi cers who are certifi ed nurses or public health nurses; and the other for fostering technical and engineering offi cials with
the same qualifi cations.

**Equipment and Technology**


While defense equipment has become more advanced and
complex, the defense industry in Japan has been exposed
to harsh conditions due to a decrease in the number
of units procured caused by Japan’s severe fi nancial
conditions and an increase in imports of foreign-made
equipment. In addition, other countries are aiming to
acquire advanced military capabilities utilizing the latest
technologies. In order to ensure the quality of defense
capabilities suffi ciently and to enhance deterrence as
well as response capabilities amid the situation in which
rapid advancements in technological innovation have a
signifi cant infl uence on the global security environment,
it is crucial that Japan ensure technological superiority

**Section 1** **[Promotion of Research and Development for Ensuring ]**
**Technological Superiority**


1 Necessity of Ensuring Technological Superiority


over other countries. Hence, Japan is required to further
develop defense equipment and technology policies
while also taking into account these points.
Amid such a situation, it is indispensable to work
on (1) strategic research and development for ensuring
Japan’s technological superiority, (2) maintenance and
strengthening of defense production and technological
bases, (3) strengthening of project management, and
(4) promotion of defense equipment and technology
cooperation, in order to maintain an environment in which
defense equipment that meets the SDF’s operational
needs will be procured into the future.

**[Promotion of Research and Development for Ensuring ]**

perspective of creating superior defense equipment and
ensuring Japan’s security, and also, improvement of
technology platforms is a pressing issue. The state-ofthe-art military technologies in each country are sensitive
technologies that shall not be easily shared with other
countries. From the perspective of Japan, for the areas,
which should strategically maintain their domestic
technology platforms, it is necessary to promote research
and development domestically. In the cases of defense
equipment procurement and technology cooperation
such as international joint development, it is important
to maintain the leading role by owning important cuttingedge technology (key technology). This requires not
only research and development by the MOD, but also
the promotion of research and development by both the
public and private sectors together.


As the security environment surrounding Japan
becomes increasingly severe, it is necessary to ensure
technological superiority by effectively utilizing Japan’s
advanced technological strength in order to protect the
lives and property of Japanese people in any situation.
Particularly in recent years, with the rapid advances
in technological innovation, it is forecast that we will
see the operationalization of so-called game-changing
technology that will completely transform combat aspects
in the future, and the United States and other countries
are proceeding hastily with research and development.

[See] Part I, Chapter 3, Section 6 (Trends Concerning Military

Science and Technology as well as Defense Production and
Technological Bases)

Thus, as a nation, strategically working on the
ways to ensure technological superiority and ensuring
advanced technology platforms are important from the

2 Defense Technology Strategy and related documents


For the purpose of ensuring Japan’s technological
superiority, inventing as well as delivering advanced
equipment in an effective and effi cient manner, and
dealing with various policy issues pertaining to defense
and civilian technologies, taking account of the National
Security Strategy and the National Defense Program
Guidelines (NDPG), the MOD formulated the Defense
Technology Strategy in August 2016, which presented
the specifi c direction for various measures that should be
addressed strategically. Based on this strategy, the MOD
promotes various measures.

1 Overview of Defense Technology Strategy


**(1) MOD Technology Policy Objectives**
The following two objectives of the MOD technology
policy are designed to strengthen the technical
capabilities, which are the foundation of Japan’s defense
capabilities, to make the foundation more robust:
(i) Ensuring technical superiority
(ii) Delivering superior defense equipment through
effective and effi cient research and development


Vision” (see Paragraph 3 below) that promotes mediumto long-term research and development. At the same time,
it also promotes research and development that serve as
the foundation of defense force building and initiatives
such as “Innovative Science & Technology Initiative for
Security,” which puts into perspective the identifi cation
and development of advance technology expected to be
used for technology exchange with relevant domestic/
overseas agencies and defense purposes.
(iii) Protection of Technologies
The MOD implements technology control for proper
technology transfer to prevent situations in which
Japan’s technology leaks without the country’s intention,
undermining the maintenance of the peace and security
of the international community or ensuring Japan’s
technological superiority. The MOD also establishes
intellectual property management taking into account
the transfer of defense equipment and promotes the
utilization of intellectual property.


2 Medium- to Long-Term Defense Technology Outlook


The Medium- to Long-Term Defense Technology
Outlook presents an outlook of the technologies that
can be applied to equipment expected to be established
in roughly the next 20 years, and indicates technology
fi elds that need to be developed in order to ensure Japan’s
technological superiority, with a particular focus on
advanced technology fi elds that have the potential to
become game changers. It is expected that making this
Outlook, public will facilitate the integration of superior
civilian advanced technologies and the development of
technologies outside of the ministries aimed at defense
equipment applications.
This Outlook selects and makes a comprehensive
assessment of 57 cases of “future equipment technologies”[1]
and 21 cases of “potential technologies,”[2] and on that basis,
identifi es the following four technology fi elds as the focus
of research and development going forward:
(i) Efforts for unmanned technology
(ii) Efforts for smart and network technology
(iii) Efforts for high-power energy technology
(iv) Efforts to improve the function and performance of
legacy systems


**(2) Specifi c Measures to be Promoted**
The following three measures are promoted to achieve
the objectives indicated in the previous paragraph.
(i) Grasping Technological Information
With regard to various scientifi c technologies that support
defense technologies, the MOD grasps the current
situation and trends both in and outside of Japan including
dual-use technology in the public and private sectors and
cutting-edge scientifi c technology. In addition, the MOD
develops and publishes the Medium- to Long-Term
Defense Technology Outlook (see Paragraph 2 below)
to identify advanced technology fi elds, which have the
potential to become game changers.
(ii) Development of Technologies
The MOD formulates the “Research and Development

development. So far, the MOD has prepared and published
the “Future Fighter R&D Vision” in August 2010 and the
“Research and Development Vision of Future Unmanned
Equipment: Focusing on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle”
in August 2016. Based on these visions, the MOD is
currently conducting various research and study toward
technological demonstrations including those for beyond
line-of-sight type unmanned aerial vehicles.
The MOD will continue to establish and publish
research and development visions for equipment that
requires development and enhancement of technological
bases while ascertaining trends in defense technologies.

development of the next-generation warning and control
radar equipment that can respond to future airborne
threats and ballistic missiles with superior detecting
and tracking capabilities, survivability, economic
effi ciency and other aspects as well as research aiming
to load dual wavelength infrared sensors with superior
detecting and discriminating capabilities onto “advanced
optical satellites,” which are currently being planned
by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science
and Technology (MEXT) and the Japan Aerospace
Exploration Agency (JAXA), and to operate them in the
space environment. The MOD also promotes research
on high mobility powered suits and the environmental
awareness enhancement technology for remote control
vehicles that can be used fl exibly at times of various
contingencies including large-scale disasters.
Furthermore, in the area of advanced research, which
has the potential to ensure technological superiority,
the MOD conducts research regarding the element
technology of the next generation of night vision devices
as well as components of EMP warheads (EMP radiation
part), which induce the malfunction and destruction of
sensor and electronic equipment, and study on EMP
protection technology. The MOD also conducts research
regarding the electromagnetic acceleration system that
utilizes electric energy to accelerate the speed, extend the
range and realize the higher power of projectiles, which
are not feasible using conventional gunpowder, research
regarding the high-energy laser system that responds to
threats such as a large number of small unmanned aerial
vehicles and mortar shells that fl y high and low in the

3 “Research and Development Vision”


The “Research and Development Vision” provides
the direction of medium to long-term research and
development by clarifying technical challenges regarding
equipment that are deemed to become important, and
presenting a concept for defense equipment that looks
ahead to the future and a roadmap for research and
development to achieve the concept.
The MOD publishes research and development
visions and shares them with the defense industry, with
the aim of increasing predictability for relevant companies
and realizing more effective and effi cient research and

3 Initiatives regarding Research and Development


The MOD invents equipment that meets the needs of the
SDF indicated in the Medium Term Defense Program
(MTDP), including (1) improvement of air defense
capability, (2) enhancement of intelligence, surveillance,
and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, (3) unmanned
equipment that can be used fl exibly at times of various
contingencies including large-scale disasters, and
(4) enhancement of the capacity of existing equipment.
The MOD also makes proposals regarding highly
promising technologies based on technological trends,
as well as adopting advanced technologies and dual-use
technologies for prototyping, and conducts testing and
evaluation of the prototype equipment. Particularly for
improving air defense capability, with regard to future
fi ghters, the MOD conducts strategic studies including
research on the large-thrust and compact engines, the
advanced sensor system that integrates radars and
infrared sensors to enable detecting and tracking of
stealth fi ghters, and integrated fi re control technology for
expanded shooting opportunities and improved shooting
effi ciency through cooperation among multiple aircraft to
be able to take into account the development (including
the possibility of international joint development) of
fi ghters as an option before the retirement of F-2 fi ghters.
The decision on the development will be made in FY2018
and necessary measures will be taken accordingly.
Furthermore, the MOD carries out a study on the element
technology based on the high-energy laser system, which
can be applied to close air defense of vessels and bases,
and a study on the technology, which induces malfunction
or destruction of electronic equipment built into incoming
missiles to neutralize the missiles by generating and
irradiating high-powered directed microwaves.

smooth implementation of research projects, program
offi cers, who are in charge of managing research progress,
are assigned in the same manner as competitive research
funding programs being conducted by other government
ministries and agencies. The program offi cers provide
support including checking research progress and
processing budget execution procedures.
Active utilization of advanced civilian technology
through such programs is not only essential for securing
the lives and peaceful livelihood of the Japanese people
into the future, but is also benefi cial for the development
of Japan’s science, technology and innovation in
non-defense areas as well, similar to how investment
in innovative technology by the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the United States
facilitated advances in science and technology as a whole
including civilian technology, such as the development
of the Internet and GPS. From this perspective, the MOD
intends to promote relevant measures.
Moreover, under the Council for Science, Technology
and Innovation (CSTI), the “Council for Innovation
Strategy” was launched with the Chief Cabinet Secretary
as the chairman in order to coordinate implementation
of comprehensive strategies. The Minister of Defense
participates in it as a member with the aim of promoting
policies of science and technology that directly connect
with ensuring safety and security of the public by further
strengthening cooperation among industry, government
and academia, etc.

[See] Fig. III-4-1-1 (FY2017 Awarded Research Projects for the

“Innovative Science & Technology Initiative for Security” Program


The Acquisition, Technology & Logistics Agency (ATLA)
and domestic research institutions, such as universities
and independent administrative institutions, proactively
engage in research collaborations and technological
information exchanges in order to ensure that advanced
civilian technology is incorporated and effi cient research
and development is conducted. In FY2015 the MOD
launched a competitive research funding program called
“Innovative Science & Technology Initiative for Security”
to discover creative research activities conducted in
universities, research institutes, companies, etc., which
are expected to apply defense equipment in the future and
to promote promising research seeds.
While total of 33 research projects were awarded
by FY2017, this program was expanded in FY2017 in
order to enable the awards of larger-scale and longerterm research projects (total budget of about 11 billion
yen). The program will continue to run on a similar
scale in FY2018.
In the basic research areas, free thinking of
researchers leads to innovative and creative results. For
this reason, it is necessary to assign maximum value to
freedom of research when sponsoring research, so that,
for example, researchers will be able to publish all of
their research results to have a wide range of academic
discussions. Hence, in this program the MOD will neither
restrict contractors’ publication of research results, nor
designate research results as confi dential, never providing
any confi dential data to researchers. In actuality, some
research results have already been published through oral
presentations, publications, etc. From the perspective of

**Section 2** **[The Current Status of Defense Production and Technological Bases, ]**
**and the Strategy on Defense Production and Technological Bases**


Excellent defense production and technological
bases are indispensable in inventing superior defense
equipment in an effective and effi cient manner, while
ensuring technological superiority. For this reason, the


MOD established the Strategy on Defense Production
and Technological Bases in June 2014 to maintain and
strengthen the bases.


1 The Current Status of Japan’s Defense Production and Technological Bases


The term “defense production and technological bases”
refers to the human, physical and technological bases
for development, production, operation, sustainment and
maintenance, remodeling, and refurbishment of defense
equipment required for the MOD/SDF’s activities. In
Japan, most of those bases are covered by companies (the
defense industry) that manufacture defense equipment
and associated items. Therefore, a broad range of
companies,[1] which own special and advanced skills and
facilities are involved in the defense production and
technological bases. Meanwhile, the degree of defense
demand dependence (the ratio of defense-related sales that
accounts for the entire company sales) is approximately
3% on average, indicating that defense businesses are not
their primary business in many companies.[2] Furthermore,
Japanese defense production and technological bases
face some issues such as diffi culties in maintaining
and passing on skills and techniques and withdrawal of
some companies from defense businesses because the
effect of mass production is hard to expect due to limited
demand, and unit costs and maintenance/sustainment
costs are increasing due to the advances in recent defense


equipment. In addition, while research and development
expenditure is increasing, the ratio of research and
development expenditure to defense-related expenditure
has leveled off.
Furthermore, changes in the international
environment such as the realignment of the Western
defense industries and advances in international joint
development and production projects can be mentioned
as the issues that impact on Japan’s defense production
and technological bases. There are also new changes
emerging in the institutional framework, such as the
transfer of defense equipment and technology based on
the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment
and Technology (see Section 4), which was approved by
the Cabinet in April 2014.

Strategy responded to the National Security Strategy
and the National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG),
replacing “Kokusankahoshin (guideline for domestic
development/production).”[3]

For example, it is said that there are approximately 1,100 fi ghter aircraft-related companies, approximately 1,300 tank-related companies, and approximately 8,300 destroyer–related companies.

According to the survey on defense demand dependence conducted with 46 defense-related companies based on their sales performance in FY2015. Although relatively small in scale, some
companies possess important technologies for supporting the defense industry with over 50% of the defense demand dependence, in which case the scale of defense demand has a signifi cant
impact on the management of these companies.

With regard to defense equipment procurement, currently
multiple methods, such as domestic development,
international joint development and production, licensed
domestic production, utilization of commercially
produced goods, and imports, are adopted. These methods
directly affect defense production and technological
bases. According to the characteristics of defense
equipment, it is necessary to select the acquisition method
appropriately, including international joint development
and production, which became more agile and fl exible
due to the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense
Equipment and Technology.

|Ground equipment|● With regard to tanks and artillery, making use of its world-class level of strength in this area, the MOD will maintain its production and technological bases to the appropriate level. In addition, production and technological bases for mobile combat vehicles etc., will be built. ● Through further promotion of standardization (categorization), effective and eff icient acquisition as well as the maintenance and strengthening of production and technology bases of wheeled vehicles will be implemented. ● Regarding amphibious capabilities, aspects of Japan’s technological weakness will be reinforced as necessary, while defense equipment and technology cooperation that make use of our strengths will be promoted.|
|---|---|
|Supplies, etc.|● Based on factors such as compatibility with the physical characteristics of the Japanese people, the relevant foundations will be maintained, thereby making it possible to continue the procurement of supplies from domestic companies. ● As for f ields where Japan can excel, such as chemical protection equipment, adapting equipment for civilian use, and defense equipment and technology cooperation will be considered.|
|Ships|● With regard to vessels, in order to enable the MOD to respond to the latest technology such as stealth capabilities, production and technological bases will be maintained and strengthened through the entry of multiple prime enterprises. ● Consideration will be given to the bulk order of multiple escort ships with a standardized design. In doing so, a review of the format of contracts will also be considered, taking into account the effects of lowering prices. ● Since the National Defense Program Guidelines state that the number of submarines will be increased to 22, the existing bases will be maintained and strengthened through continuous research and development for enhancing capabilities.|
|Aircraft|● For the acquisition of F-35A aircraft, the MOD will make efforts to promote the industrial participation of Japanese companies in production and to prepare for the start of Regional MRO&U for F-35 aircraft in the Asia-Pacif ic region. As for future f ighter aircraft, necessary measures including empirical research will be taken so as to maintain the option of the development of future f ighter aircraft including the possibility of international joint development of an aircraft to replace the F-2 when it is time to retire it. ● With regard to transport aircraft and amphibian rescue aircraft, multifaceted use of the results of development such as the possibility of adaptation for civilian use, and defense equipment and technology cooperation will be promoted. For rotary-wing aircraft, keeping both the civilian and defense demand in mind, international joint development and production will be considered as an option based on the technologies cultivated through licensed domestic production and domestic development.|
|Explosives|● A certain scale of procurement from domestic companies will continue to be made possible and bases, which ensure the necessary scale of explosives in various situations, will be maintained.|
|Guided weapons|● In order to improve air defense performance, technological considerations regarding future SAMs will be pursued to further strengthen the relevant technological bases. A vision for research and development for the implementation of technological examinations of future guided weapons will be established including propulsion devices such as f ixed rocket motors and other technologies required to improve the performance of various types of guided weapons such as the extension of their launch range. ● Regarding international joint development as one option, eff icient acquisition methods will be selected based also on the enhancement of interoperability with allied and friendly nations. ● Along with the continuous promotion of SM-3 Block IIA Cooperative Development (SCD) between Japan and the United States, necessary measures for the transition to the production and deployment phases will be taken, considering the sustainment and enhancement of production and technological phases.|
|Communications electronics and command control systems|● Research and development on cutting-edge technology for the bases required for defense will be implemented with priority, involving the improvement of the detection performance of f xied warning and control radar systems as well as the simultaneous, parallel use of multiple sonar systems. At the same time, the technological bases will be maintained and strengthened by pursuing the applicability of cutting-edge civilian technology. ● Because systems capable of responding to battles based around network data are necessary for future command control systems, civilian technological bases, which are progressing at a signif icant pace, will be adopted to ensure a system replacement at the appropriate timing ref lecting the latest technological standards. ● Defense equipment and technology cooperation, as well as civilian use of wireless software technology, radar technology, which uses high-output semiconductors, and other technologies will be promoted.|
|Unmanned equipment|● In light of the trend towards defense technology such as future battle conditions, smarter technologies and networking, a vision for research and development will be established and proactive research will be implemented for the enhancement of technological bases in order to present a direction of unmanned equipment whilst taking the perspective of integrated operation into account. ● Defense equipment and technology cooperation such as research collaboration with research institutions and joint research and development with other countries will be advanced in order to raise the level of Japan’s technological bases.|
|Cyber and space systems|● While cooperating with the MOD’s initiatives to increase its capability to respond to cyber attacks and policies relating to the use of space development, from the perspective of the defense of Japan, the future outlook of defense production and technological bases, which will be required in the future, will be discussed.|

NANRI Co., Ltd., Representative Director and President, Kazuhiro Nanri

NANRI Co., Ltd., was founded in 1939 and manufactured automobile and special vehicle parts as a supervised plant for the Army
Arsenal during the war and as a registered vendor for the U.S. Military Procurement Bureau after the war. Our involvement in defense
products began with repairs of underbody parts (trackbelt, track rollers, and sprockets) of tracked vehicles (tanks, armored cars,
and others) provided to the Ground Self Defense Forces from the U.S. military. We developed our unique repair technologies by using
U.S. military manuals as reference. Now we are mainly conducting repairs of underbody parts of all armored vehicles of the Ground
Self Defense Forces as our primary business.
NANRI Co. Ltd is a small company with about 20 employees. We creatively produce machine tools and repair tools necessary
for our work so that we can perform almost all processes internally. All employees (including the president) are skilled workers who
are engaged in fi eld operations. Given diffi culties of technology transmission, which is an issue for small companies, we are making
efforts to assure the stable quality through the application of new technologies (such as welding robots).
The business environment for tracked vehicles has been getting severe in recent years. While this raises concerns about
continuing our business because we heavily rely on the defense industry, I believe that it is important to keep our repair technology
that has been cultivated over many years, and to maintain our pride and sense of responsibility as the only domestic repair company.
We will continue to work on maintaining our foundation with manufacturing capabilities that are trusted by customers.

1 Project Management throughout Its Life Cycle


also carried out a comparison between these statuses and
the Acquisition Strategy of the 12 equipment for project
management selected in 2016, conducted quantitative and
objective analysis and evaluation based on these plans, and
reviewed the Acquisition Strategy. Regarding equipment
that has not yet been selected for project management
or semi-project management, ATLA is also considering
designating them as new project and semi-project.

[See] Fig. III-4-3-1 (Equipment for Project Management and Equipment

[See]

for Semi-Project Management)


Acquisition of Defense Equipment through
1
Focused Project Management

Since defense equipment is becoming more advanced
and complex in recent years, the cost of the entire life
cycle of the equipment has tended to increase (equipment
design, research and development, full rate production
and acquisition, and maintenance). For acquiring the
necessary number of equipment when it is needed, it is
extremely important to streamline the process throughout
the life cycle of equipment.
Therefore, the Department of Project Management
in ATLA selects important equipment which functions,
performance, costs and schedule are managed throughout
the life cycle of equipment (project management),
and works to realize the most effi cient acquisition in
accordance with operational needs.
To realize the effi cient acquisition of equipment
that will enable effective and effi cient operation and
maintenance, in addition to the 12 equipment for project
management selected in November 2015, the MOD
selected another equipment for project management as
well as 3 equipment for semi-project management[1] in
April 2017. The MOD designated a Project Manager
(PM) responsible for project management for each
equipment. At the same time, the Ministry also
established the Integrated Project Team (IPT), which is
composed of offi cials from relevant departments within
the Ministry. In 2016 and 2017, for the equipment of
project management and the equipment for semi-project
management, the MOD prepared the Acquisition
Strategy and the Acquisition Plan to state the basic
matters necessary to practice project management
systematically, such as the purpose of the acquisition
program and acquisition policy, and the cost of the
life cycle. The MOD practices project management in
accordance with these plans and works to realize the
most strategically effi cient equipment acquisition.
Specifi cally, in light of acquisition plans prepared by
each service and the status of these plans, ATLA checks
the progress of each acquisition program and the status of
cost from a comprehensive perspective. In 2017, ATLA

the equipment, the MOD promotes the introduction of the
cost and schedule management method for visualizing
the progress by each Work Breakdown Structure (WBS),[2]
to detect early the signs of cost increase and schedule
delay so that swift measures can be taken.

**(2) Method for More Accurate Cost Estimate**
Costs such as life cycle cost are estimated based on actual
cost data of similar equipment developed or introduced
in the past. However, as a larger amount of cost data is
needed for a more accurate estimate, the MOD has built
a cost database and promotes the collection of cost data.
Since accumulating suffi cient amount of cost data takes
time, using statistical methods is also considered.


Effective and Effi cient Acquisition from a joint
3
Perspective

Acquisition of defense equipment based on a joint
perspective is required to build a Dynamic Joint
Defense Force.
So far, based on the, the Ministry has been striving
to reduce development, acquisition, and maintenance
expenses through (1) making the equipment function
integrated, and (2) procuring common equipment and
supplies in bulk, standardizing some components, and
development of product families, etc.[3]

Hereafter, the Ministry will promote effective
and efficient acquisition throughout the life cycle of
the defense equipment by adopting perspective of
project management from the conceptual phase that
is becoming more advanced and complex due to the
cutting-edge technology such as systemization and
networking technology.


**(3) Development and Accumulation of Expertise**
**through Strengthened Cooperation with Research**
**and Educational Institutions, etc.**

For further improving the management skill as of project
managers and for developing human resources among
those who engages in project management, the MOD
strengthens collaboration with research and educational
institutions on project management by regular training
sessions on project management methods used overseas
and in the private sectors.



**[KEY WORD]**

Development of product families

This refers to adding different variations to the functions and

performance of equipment to enable them to respond to different

operational demands, while standardizing their basic component parts.


2 Improving the Contract System and Other Related Matters


1 Reviewing Acquisition Systems

For the purpose of promoting acquisition reform, which is
a prompt response to swiftly changing surroundings, the
MOD has been holding meetings of the Comprehensive
Acquisition Reform Committee since 2007, besides the
Contractual Systems Study Groups has been held since
2010 to review acquisition systems. Since FY2016, a
special research offi cer system[4] has been adopted in order
to surely embody the review results.


2 Long-Term Contracts, etc.

The production of defense equipment requires a
signifi cant amount of time. Therefore, if a certain set
amount is to be procured in bulk, in many cases a
contract for more than fi ve years is needed. With regard
to defense equipment and services, economies of scale[5]
tend not to work mainly due to the following reasons:
(1) the annual procurement quantity is small; (2) the
MOD is the only customer; and (3) companies that
provide such defense equipment, etc., are limited. In
addition, it is diffi cult for companies to systematically
move forward with their businesses with a high degree of


WBS is a hierarchical structure used to practice project management that systematically divides the project into manageable units, in which the schedule and cost of each deliverable (components
and services) are allocated.

Examples of “procuring common equipment and supplies in bulk,” “standardizing some components,” and “development of product families” are small arms, vehicles, and chemical supplies used
by the Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF), Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF), and Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF), short-range surface-to-air missiles used by the GSDF and ASDF, and anti-ship
missiles used by all three branches of the SDF, respectively.

This is a system to conduct research, which contributes to the acquisition system of defense equipment, by inviting experts such as associate professors from different universities specializing in
the areas of concern in order to review and reconsider an effective procurement system, based not only on the viewpoints of the Ministry of Defense personnel but also on theories that have been
proposed in the fi eld of business administration and economics.


-----

predictability, which is peculiar to the defense industry.
For these reasons, the upper limit of acts that incur
national debt prescribed in the Public Finance Act as
within fi ve years in principle was changed to within ten
years for specifi c equipment through the enactment of
the Long-term Contract Act.[6] The introduction of this
change regarding long-term contracts will make stable
procurement possible, leading to the realization of the
systematic improvement of defense capability. At the
same time, for companies, given that the procurement
amount will be assured, the systematic use of personnel
and equipment, as well as cost reductions due to bulk
orders, will be made possible. Furthermore, this will
prevent subcontractors from withdrawing from the
defense industry.

[See] Fig. III-4-3-2 (Image of Long-term Contracts and the Cost

[See]

Reduction Effect)
Part II, Chapter 2, Section 4 (3 Initiatives for Greater Effi ciency)

In addition, by realizing longer-term multiple-year
contracts utilizing the PFI Act,[7] it achieves the planned
acquisition and execution of budgets through the
standardization of investment amounts of the national
expenditure and draws out certain benefi ts such as
cutting equipment procurement costs by reducing risks
for those taking orders and by promoting the entry of
new suppliers. As projects using the PFI Act, the MOD
launched the “project of development and operation of
X-band satellite communications” in January 2013 and
the “project of operation and management of private
ships” in March 2016.
In addition, regarding procurement of certain
equipment with which little competitiveness can be
expected due to its characteristics, and companies that
work on cost reduction using the MOD’s programs, the
MOD promotes limited tendering contracts while ensuring
transparency and fairness as well as clarifying and
putting the subject into patterns, from the perspective of
the implementation of smooth and effi cient procurement,
and the enhancement of the company’s predictability.
Specifi cally, as a new initiative, in acquiring new
destroyers with the combined features of improved
capabilities to respond to various missions and a compact
hull, the MOD has adopted a procurement method to
acquire the new destroyer effi ciently equipped with
the necessary functions and to maintain and strengthen


the construction technology base since February 2017.
This is done by selecting a party that has made the
best proposal with respect to the MOD’s requirements
as a procurement counterparty, with the runner-up
also involved in designing and building facilities as a
subcontractor. The MOD concluded a proposal agreement
in April 2017 and decided on a procurement counterparty
and a subcontractor in August 2017.


Decrease Procurement Cost and Improve
3
Companies’ Incentives to Reduce Cost


With regard to the procurement of defense equipment,
there is a large variety of equipment without a market price,
and therefore, they tend to have high prices. In light of this
characteristic, it is necessary to achieve both the reduction
of procurement cost and improvement of companies’
incentives to reduce cost simultaneously. Thus, the MOD
has been striving to achieve the reduction of procurement
prices by confi rming the actual costs incurred and ensuring
that no excessive business profi t will be added after the
execution of the contract through cost audit contracts
with a special provision requiring respective companies
to conduct a review of the contract sum and return any
excessive profi t (audit contracts incorporating a provision
requiring the return of excessive profi t).
However, it has also been noted that these contracts
diminish the companies’ motivation for cost reduction as
they would be required to return excessive profi ts after
the completion of the contract payment at the end of
the fi scal year. Therefore, the MOD is developing a new
incentive contract system in which public and private
sectors jointly carry out the management of contract
implementation to minimize the risk of it, and in which a
certain percentage will be given back to the companies if
the cost reduction has been performed.
In addition, using special research offi cers
and companies with expertise, the MOD conducts
examinations of frameworks for reviewing cost reduction
measures based on a public-private partnership, and
new methods for more effi cient and reduced equipment
procurement costs by encouraging competition among
companies by way of the MOD’s active evaluation of
business partners.

3 Initiatives Aimed at Increasing the Effi ciency of Procurement, and Other Related Initiatives


entering into contracts for defense equipment, supplies,
and components based on the approach of consolidating
the quantities required for several years into a single
specifi c fi scal year. In the FY2018 budget, some reduction
in expenses is expected due to a bulk purchase of the nextgeneration IFF equipment for fi ghters (F-15), computer
software licenses, and other equipment.
In addition, the MOD is facilitating the compilation
of a database on the breakdown of procurement price and
actual price of major equipment in the past. By using
this database, the Ministry expects not only to verify the
validity of procurement prices, but also to enhance the
accuracy and effi ciency of life cycle cost estimation for
new equipment.

[See] Part II, Chapter 2, Section 4 (3 Initiatives for Increasing the

Effi ciency of Procurement)



Effective and Effi cient Maintenance and
1
Replenishment


With regard to periodic maintenance checks of defense
equipment, the MOD has been working to achieve
greater effi ciency by extending the interval between
the maintenance checks, after making suffi cient effort
to ensure safety. In addition, the MOD embarks on the
introduction of Performance Based Logistics (PBL)[8] from
the perspective of improving the equipment availability
ratio and long-term cost reductions. In the FY2018
budget, cost savings can be expected due to conclusion
of an umbrella agreement regarding maintenance parts
for the F110 engine (for fi ghter (F-2)) and transport
helicopters (CH-47J/JA) and others.

[See] Part II, Chapter 2, Section 4 (3 Initiatives for Increasing the

Effi ciency of Procurement)


3 Efforts to Increase Fairness and Transparency


The MOD implements measures for making contracts
more appropriate and strengthening checking functions
to promote the enhancement of fairness and transparency
in relation to the acquisition of equipment and materials.
As a part of the effort to “make public procurement
more appropriate” across the whole government, the
MOD continues to carry out the introduction and
expansion of a comprehensive evaluation bidding system[9]
and make bidding procedures more effi cient. In addition


Achieving Further Effi ciency in the Acquisition of
2
Defense Equipment


When acquiring defense equipment, the MOD aims
to reduce development, acquisition, and maintenance
expenses by procuring common equipment and
supplies in bulk, standardizing some components, and
developing product families, etc., in addition to a review
of the contract system. The MOD also carries out bulk
purchases, seeking greater effi ciency by budgeting and


PBL is a contract method that involves payment of compensation according to the level of equipment performance achieved, in terms of availability ratio and stable stock. It has achieved positive
outcomes upon application to the maintenance and servicing of equipment in Western countries.

Unlike the automatic bid system which focuses only on price, this is a system which the successful bidder is determined on the basis of a comprehensive evaluation that includes both the price and

to these, based on refl ection on the past, strengthening
system investigation, reviewing penalties, ensuring the
effectiveness of supervision and inspection, and other
measures have steadily been carried out in order to
prevent recurrence of incidents such as overcharging and
falsifi ed results of equipment testing by defense-related
companies. Through these measures, the MOD strives to
surely prevent recurrence of scandals, enhance fairness
and transparency, and make contracts more appropriate.
In addition, ATLA carries out multilayered checks
through both internal and external checking systems


for stricter checks – namely, ATLA conducts internal
inspections, by establishing the inspection and audit
department, and through deliberations in the Defense
Procurement Council, consisting of external experts, and
defense inspection conducted by the Inspector General’s
Offi ce of Legal Complaints. Moreover, ATLA has also
improved its education department and strives to enhance
compliance awareness by providing thorough education
pertaining to compliance for ATLA personnel.

Commentary Improvement of FMS related issues **COLUMN**

Foreign Military Sales (FMS) is the U.S. security program through which the U.S. allies and others can purchase defense equipment and
services from the U.S. government based on the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), so it is different from sales for the purpose of economic
profi ts. Between the Japanese and the U.S. governments, FMS is based on the Japan-U.S. Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement. This
program allows Japan to procure equipment with a high level of military confi dentiality which cannot be generally purchased through
Direct Commercial Sales and the higher performance equipment which is only manufactured by the U.S. This is the reason why FMS is
very important in strengthening Japan’s defense capabilities, and Japan’s FMS procurement amount has been increasing in recent years.
Meanwhile, there are FMS-related issues, such as late case closures and cost transparency. Japan and the U.S. have been actively
engaged in making improvements in these issues, as the result of repeated requests for improvements to the U.S. side based on points
raised by indications from the Board of Audits and requests by Defense Minister Onodera to U.S. Defense Secretary Mattis for cooperation in
lowering prices in order to build up the most effi cient defense capabilities in the current severe security environment.
On June 2018, Minister Onodera and Secretary Mattis held the Japan-U.S. Defense Ministerial Meeting and the ministers welcomed
improvements in challenges regarding Foreign Military Sales such as strengthening efforts to improve cost transparency and late case
closures as well as initiating concrete discussion on more effi cient multi-year contracts. The ministers affi rmed that both countries would
continue to make efforts to realize Japan’s smooth and timely procurement of U.S.-made assets.
The Ministry of Defense continues make efforts to improve FMS - related issues in close cooperation with the U.S.

-  In the formulation of the FY2018 budget, the MOD held negotiations with the United States regarding FMS costs and made efforts to reduce expenditure by scrutinizing
the cost. For example, for tilt-rotor aircraft (V-22 Osprey), in its negotiations with the United States, the MOD sought to leverage economies of scale through joint
procurement of Osprey aircraft with the U.S. Navy (40 aircraft) and to scrutinize minimum initial cost necessary for operations. As a result, the MOD was able to realize
a cost reduction of 25.5 billion yen, reducing the cost from 97.1 billion yen, as estimated at the FY2018 budget request stage, to 71.6 billion yen in the actual budget.

**Section 4 Defense Equipment and Technology Cooperation**


Based on the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense
Equipment and Technology, Japan promotes cooperation
in defense equipment and technology with other countries
in order to contribute to promoting the maintenance and
enhancement of defense production and technological
bases, as well as contributing to the promotion of our
national security, peace and international cooperation.


Japan will continue to realize effective defense equipment
and technological cooperation through the strengthening of
intelligence gathering such as the needs of its counterparts,
cooperation including assistance for maintenance and
repair of equipment, and strengthening of cooperative
posture between the public and private sectors.


1 Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology


2 Main Contents of the New Three Principles

**(1) Clarifi cation of Cases Where Transfers are**
**Prohibited (the First Principle)**

The cases where overseas transfers of defense equipment
are prohibited are clarifi ed as follows: (1) in the case of
violating the obligations based on agreements signed by
Japan and other international agreements; (2) in the case
of violating the obligations based on the Resolution of
the United Nations Security Council; or (3) in the case of
transferring to the countries in confl icts.

[See] Fig. III-4-4-1 (The First Principle “The Cases Where Transfers

Are Prohibited”)


Purpose of Establishment of the Three Principles
1
on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology

Japan has dealt with arms exports in a careful manner,
in accordance with the Three Principles of Arms Exports
and their related policy guidelines. On the other hand,
in individual cases, such as the participation of domestic
companies in the joint development of Ballistic Missile
Defense (BMD) by Japan and the United States, it has
taken separate measures in which arms exports are dealt
with outside the Three Principles.[1]

Amidst this situation, in April 2014, based on the
National Security Strategy, the Government formulated
the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment
and Technology as new principles replacing the Three
Principles on Arms Exports etc.[2] and its implementation
guidelines. The new principles clarifi ed the concrete
standards, procedures and limitation.

[See] Reference 66 (Three Principles on Transfer of Defense

Equipment and Technology)


**(2) Limitation to Cases Where Transfers May Be**
**Permitted As Well As Strict Examination and**
**Information Disclosure (the Second Principle)**

The cases where transfers may be permitted are limited
to (1) cases that contribute to the active promotion
of peace contribution and international cooperation,
(2) cases that contribute to the security of Japan, or other
cases. The Government will conduct strict examination
on the appropriateness of the destination and end user


Fig. III-4-4-1 The First Principle “The Cases Where Transfers Are Prohibited”

|Situation|Specif ic examples|
|---|---|
|(1) Violation of obligations under treaties concluded and other international arrangements|Chemical Weapons Convention, Convention on Cluster Munitions, Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention, Arms Trade Treaty, etc.|
|(2) Violation of obligations under United Nations Security Council Resolutions|Security Council Resolution 1718 (nuclear issue of North Korea), etc.|
|(3) Transfer to a nation which is party to a conf lict|Countries which are the target of measures taken by the United Nations Security Council to maintain or restore international peace and security in the event of an armed attack|


In December 2011, the Statement by the Chief Cabinet Secretary on Guidelines for Overseas Transfer of Defense Equipment, etc. put in place exemptions from the Three Principles of Arms Exports
based on the premise of strict control, with regard to (1) cases related to peace contribution and international cooperation, and (2) cases regarding international joint development and production of
defense equipment, etc. that contributes to Japan’s security.

The term “defense equipment” is deemed appropriate for the title of “Three Principles for the Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology,” since possible articles of overseas transfers help peace
contribution and international cooperation as was seen in the example of the provision of bulldozers and other items belonging to the SDF to disaster-stricken countries. Similarly, due to the fact that


-----

Fig. III-4-4-2 The Second Principle “Limitation to Cases Where Transfers May Be Permitted”

|Situation|Specif ic examples|
|---|---|
|(1) Contribution to the proactive advancement of peace contribution and international cooperation|Overseas transfers that contribute to active promotion of peace contribution and international cooperation, only if the transfers have positive meaning from the viewpoint of peace contribution and international cooperation and when: ● the recipient is a foreign government, or ● the recipient is the United Nations (UN) System or organizations conducting the activities based on a UN resolution|
|(2) Contribution to the security of Japan|Overseas transfers that contribute to Japan’s security, only if the transfers have positive meaning from the viewpoint of Japan’s security, and that: ● are related to international joint development and production with countries cooperating with Japan in security area including the U.S., ● contribute to enhancing security and defense cooperation with countries cooperating with Japan in security area including the U.S., and of the following: • overseas transfer of defense equipment and technology included in the provision of supplies and services implemented by the SDF in accordance with laws, • provision of military technology as a part of mutual exchange of technology with the U.S., • provision of parts or services related to a licensed product of the U.S. or provision of repair services etc. to the U.S. armed forces, or • defense equipment and technology related to cooperation concerning rescue, transportation, vigilance, surveillance or minesweeping with countries cooperating with Japan in security area, or ● are necessary for supporting activities of the governmental agencies including the Self-Defense Forces (hereinafter referred to as “the SDF etc.”), which include the activities of foreign governments or private entities etc. related to the activities of the SDF etc., or for ensuring the safety of Japanese nationals, and that are: • temporary export of equipment, return of purchased equipment or provision of technical information related to the activities of the SDF etc. including replacements of items which need repairing with non-defective items, • export of equipment for the protection or self-protection of public off icials, or • export of equipment for the self-protection of Japanese nationals operating in danger areas|
|(3) In cases where the inf luence is judged extremely limited from the perspective of the security of Japan|• Returning of misdirected items • Export of sample items on the premise that they will be returned • Re-export of equipment brought in by police off icers of overseas government agencies|


**(3) Ensuring Appropriate Control regarding Extra-Purpose**
**Use or Transfer to Third Parties (the Third Principle)**

Overseas transfer of defense equipment and technology
will be permitted only in cases where appropriate control
is ensured, and the Government will in principle oblige
the government of the recipient country to gain its prior
consent regarding extra-purpose use and transfer to third
parties. However, in cases where it is judged appropriate
for the active promotion of peace contribution and
international cooperation, cases involving participation
in the international systems for sharing parts, and cases
where parts are delivered to a licenser, appropriate control
may be ensured with the confi rmation of the control
system at the destination.


whilst ensuring transparency, and the extent the overseas
transfer of such equipment and technology will raise
concern for Japan’s security. In addition, it has been
decided that important cases would be deliberated at
the National Security Council and along with this,
information concerning the cases that were deliberated
would be disclosed.

[See] Fig. III-4-4-2 (The Second Principle “Limitation to Cases Where

Transfers May Be Permitted”)


2 Deepening Relationships with the United States regarding Defense Equipment and Technology Cooperation


and parts, etc. related to the Aegis System and F100
engine parts that are installed in F-15 and F-16 from
Japan to the United States, Japan has affi rmed since July
2014 that these overseas transfers fall under the case,
which may be permitted, based on deliberations at the
National Security Council.

[See] Part III, Chapter 1, Section 2-3-2 (Missile Defense of the United

States and Japan-U.S. BMD Technical Cooperation)
Reference 23 (Japan–U.S. Joint Research and Development
Projects)


1 Cooperative Research and Development, etc.

Since 1992, Japan has implemented 21 cooperative
research projects and 1 cooperative development
project with the United States. At present, 4 cooperative
research projects (cooperative research on Hybrid
Electric Propulsion, cooperative research on High-Speed
Multi-Hull Vessel Optimization, cooperative research on
Comparison of Operational Jet Fuel and Noise Exposures,
cooperative research on Chemical Agent Detector-kit
Colorimetric Reader) are in operation. In addition, with

structural components, such as main wings, fuselage,
and turbines without transporting the airframe and
engines overseas; and
❍ The ability to carry out refurbishment work domestically,
in the event that performance improvements to the
F-35A fi ghter aircraft are sought in future.
In addition, participation of Japanese companies in
the implementation of FACO and parts production will
have signifi cance in that they will be able to come in
contact with the system integration technology of stealth
fi ghter as well as the cutting-edge fi ghter technology
and know-how. Therefore, it will also contribute to
strengthening of defense production and technological
bases. The F-35A fi ghter aircraft on which FACO was
conducted in Japan was deployed to the ASDF Misawa
Air Base in January 2018.
As global operation of F-35 fi ghter aircraft is
anticipated, the U.S. Government plans to establish
maintenance depot (regional Maintenance, Repair,
Overhaul and Upgrade (MRO&U) Capability) mainly for
airframe and engine in the North America, Europe, and
the Asia-Pacifi c regions. In December 2014, with regard
to regional MRO&U in the Asia-Pacifi c region for F-35,
the U.S. Government announced the following decisions:
(1) Regional MRO&U Capability for airframe will be
provided to Japan and Australia with both capabilities
required not later than early 2018;[4] (2) With regard to the
regional MRO&U Capability for engine, initial capability
will be provided by Australia by early 2018, with Japan
providing additional capability at least 3-5 years later.[5]

Establishing a maintenance depot that utilizes the
FACO facility for airframe and engine within Japan, and
contributing to maintenance in the Asia-Pacifi c region are
signifi cant from the perspectives of securing the operational
support system for F-35A fi ghter aircraft in Japan,
maintaining the foundation of the Japanese defense industry,
strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance, and deepening
equipment cooperation in the Asia-Pacifi c region.


Production, Sustainment and Maintenance of Common

Equipment between Japan and the United States

**(1) Participation of Japanese Industry in the Production**
**of the F-35A and the Establishment of Regional**
**Maintenance, Repair, Overhaul and Upgrade**
**(MRO&U) Capability**

In December 2011, Japan selected the F-35A fi ghter
aircraft as the next-generation fi ghter aircraft to succeed
the F-4 fi ghter aircraft. At the same time, the Government
decided to procure 42 aircraft from FY2012 onwards and to
have Japanese industries participate in its production, aside
from several complete aircraft, which shall be imported.
In light of this decision, the Japanese Government has
been working to enable the involvement of Japanese
industries in the manufacturing process in preparation
for the acquisition of F-35A fi ghter aircraft from FY2013
onwards. So far the Japanese Government has decided
on the range of production participation by Japanese
industries including the Final Assembly and Check Out
(FACO) for airframe and engines, the manufacture of some
engine parts (19 items) and radar parts (7 items), and the
manufacture of some Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture
System (EODAS)[3] parts (3 items).
Possessing the skills and facilities required for
FACO for airframe and engines is important for Japanese
companies in implementing effective operational
support for the F-35A fi ghter aircraft such as for the
following reasons:
❍ The ability to offer a swift response within Japan in
the event that an airframe and engines suffer damage
and require work that cannot be carried out by the SDF
unit itself, including the repair or replacement of major


**(2) Initiatives towards the Establishment of a Common**
**Maintenance Base of the Japan-U.S. Osprey**

As the Planed Maintenance Interval (PMI) of the U.S.
Marine Corps Osprey deployed at Futenma was scheduled
to commence roughly in 2017, the U.S. Navy carried
out a public tender to select a maintenance company

Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System (EODAS), comprising six built-in cutting edge infrared sensors per aircraft, realizes 360-degree spherical situational awareness, and enables missile
detection and tracking.

The regional MRO&U for airframe in Japan is scheduled to be located at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (Komaki-minami factory in Aichi Prefecture)

The regional MRO&U for engine in Japan is scheduled to be located at IHI Corporation (Mizuho factory in Tokyo)

maintenance company for this purpose in October 2015.
From February 2017, the PMI has been performed at
GSDF Camp Kisarazu.
The MOD intends to establish common maintenance
base for both Japan’s and the United States’ Osprey by
allowing the maintenance company to use the hangar at
GSDF Camp Kisarazu for aircraft maintenance of the U.S.
Marine Corps Osprey and also to implement the future
aircraft maintenance of the GSDF Osprey at the same camp


from the following perspectives: (1) Smooth introduction
of the GSDF Osprey (V-22);[7] (2) Smooth and effective
operation of the Japan-U.S. security arrangements; and
(3) Enhanced effi ciency in maintenance. The establishment
of common maintenance base at GSDF Camp Kisarazu
would be extremely signifi cant in that it will lead to the
realization of the reduction of Okinawa’s burden as well
as the “Strengthening the basis to repair and maintain
common equipment” stated in the new guideline.


3 Building New Defense Equipment and Technology Cooperation


operative Research on The Certifi cation Process of Jet
Engines, the Cooperative Research on The Feasibility of
a Japan and Great Britain Universal Advanced RF System
(JAGUAR) were launched in July 2016, February 2018
and March 2018, respectively.
Furthermore, a LOA on the Joint Preliminary Study
on Potential Collaborative Opportunities for Future
Combat Air System (FCAS)[10]/Future Fighter between
the defense authorities of the two countries was signed in
March 2017. Based on the agreement of this arrangement,
the two countries are exchanging information regarding
future fi ghter and the FCAS that are under study by Japan
and the United Kingdom respectively, and opinions
about the potential for future collaboration. At the Third
UK-Japan Foreign and Defence Ministerial Meeting
(“2+2”) held in December 2017, in response to the
progress of the feasibility study on a Joint New Air-to-Air
Missile (JNAAM) Phase 2, the two countries expressed
expectations for the early embodiment of the cooperative
research project including the research prototyping and
the test fi ring.

Japan-France Foreign and Defense Ministers’ Meeting
(“2+2”) held in January 2018, the two countries confi rmed
the intention to quickly start the cooperative research


Defense Equipment and Technology Cooperation
1
with Major European Countries, etc.

Defense equipment and technology cooperation with
major European countries, which have competitive
defense industries, will contribute to the strengthening of
security and defense cooperation with these countries as
well as the maintenance and strengthening of the defense
production and technological base in Japan. Therefore,
Japan seeks to establish and deepen relationships with
these countries.


**(1) United Kingdom**
In July 2013, the Governments of Japan and the United
Kingdom concluded a bilateral Agreement on the
Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology.[8] In the
same month, the two countries also started Chemical and
Biological Protection Technology cooperative research
project, marking the fi rst time that Japan had engaged in
such research with a country other than the United States.
The joint research resulted in success in July 2017.
Also, in July 2014, technology information on airto-air missile seeker technology[9] for cooperative research
with the United Kingdom was determined by the National
Security Council as a case where overseas transfer may be
permitted as stipulated in the Three Principles on Transfer
of Defense Equipment and Technology. Responding to
the said decision, in November of the same year, a Letter
of Arrangement was signed on the “co-operative research
project on the feasibility of a joint new air-to-air missile”
and the cooperative research started. The Cooperative

or transfer to the governments of developing states the
SDF’s equipment which is no longer used for a lower
price than the current price. Based on a proposal from
the Philippines, the transfer was confi rmed at the JapanPhilippines Defence Ministerial Meeting in June 2018
that parts and maintenance equipment of the UH-1H
utility helicopters, that became unnecessary for the SDF
would also be donated.
Between Thailand, State Minister of Defense
Yamaguchi visited Thailand in November 2017, inspected
an international exhibition on defense equipment
(Defense and Security 2017), and agreed to promote
future defense equipment and technology cooperation
between the two countries including early conclusion
of the agreement concerning the Transfer of Defense
Equipment and Technology at the meeting with high
offi cials of the Ministry of Defence of Thailand.
Between Vietnam, the Terms of Reference (TOR)
for regular consultations concerning defense equipment
and technological cooperation was signed during the
Japan-Vietnam Defense Vice-ministerial Level Meeting
in November 2016.
Japan and Malaysia signed the Japan-Malaysia
Agreement concerning the Transfer of Defence
Equipment and Technology[16] in April 2018. The MOD
will continue to promote cooperation for humanitarian
assistance and disaster relief as well as the maritime
security area through these initiatives.

**(3) ASEAN Countries**
Between Japan and ASEAN member states, exchanges
of views take place regarding defense equipment and
technology cooperation in non-traditional security
sectors, such as humanitarian assistance, disaster relief
and maritime security through the Japan-ASEAN
Defense Vice-Ministerial Meetings and other occasions.
Participating countries have expressed their expectation
for Japan’s cooperation in effectively dealing with these
issues. In the “Vientiane Vision” announced by Japan
at the ASEAN-Japan Defence Ministers’ Informal
Meeting held in November 2016, it is stated that Japan’s
defense equipment and technological cooperation with
ASEAN countries would be promoted with a focus on
the following three points: (1) equipment and technology
transfer, (2) human resources development, and (3)
holding seminars on defense industries. As a specifi c
initiative with the Philippines, an offi cial agreement was
made on the transfer of MSDF’s TC-90 training aircraft
to the Philippine Navy at the Japan-Philippines Summit
Meeting in September 2016, and TC-90 pilot training
was conducted for pilots from the Philippine Navy at
the MSDF Tokushima Air Base from November of the
same year to March 2018. Since April 2017, maintenance
and repair assistance by dispatched personnel from a
Japanese maintenance company has been provided.
Furthermore, two TC-90 aircraft were transferred to
the Philippine Navy in March 2017, and the remaining
three TC-90 aircraft were transferred in March 2018.
This transfer was the fi rst case of application of the
provision of the SDF Act that enables the MOD to grant

Cooperation with Developing Countries

Surrounded by an increasingly severe security
environment, it has become even more important for
Japan that the nations which have a cooperative and
friendly relationship with Japan in terms of security and


-----

defense have appropriate capabilities. It is also critical to
develop a foundation that will serve as the basis for the
international community to cooperate towards improving
the security environment. Among these friendly nations,
some have diffi culties in acquiring the adequate level
of defense equipment by their own because of their
economic and fi nancial situations. Some of these states
are requesting to use SDF’s equipment which are no
longer used. However, Article 9, Paragraph 1 of the
Public Finance Act stipulates that the Government shall
receive reasonable consideration when transferring or
leasing any governmental properties including the SDF’s
equipment to other countries. Therefore, a transfer for
lower price than the current price is not allowed unless
otherwise provided.
Under these circumstances, to respond to the needs
of such friendly nations, a special provision to Article 9,
Paragraph 1 of the Public Finance Act[17] was created in

4 Adapting Defense Equipment for Civilian Use


the SDF Act. This provision enables the MOD to grant
or transfer to the governments of developing states the
SDF’s equipment which is no longer used for a lower
price than the current price. (Legislation for the partial
revision of the Act for Establishment of the Ministry
of Defense and other Acts including this provision was
approved in May 2017).
Even in the case of granting or transferring equipment
for lower price than the current price pursuant to this
provision, whether or not to transfer such equipment and
to which government such equipment to be transferred
will be determined on a case-by-case basis in light of
the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment
and Technology and other regulations. In addition, an
international agreement must be concluded between
the Governments of Japan and the recipient countries to
prevent extra-purpose use and third party transfer of the
transferred equipment without the prior consent of Japan.[18]

application procedure for private companies interested in
civilian use. So far, technical data related to the civilian
use of the US-2 amphibian rescue aircraft and the F7-10
engine that are mounted on P-1 maritime patrol aircraft
have been disclosed in response to requests from the
implementing companies. In December 2016, ATLA and
IHI Corporation, a manufacturing company of F7-10
engine, signed a contract for the civilian use of the F7-10
for sales to JAXA for the fi rst time.
The MOD will consider the possibility of civilian use
of equipment other than aircraft based on the intention of
defense industry.


With regard to aircraft involving many technological
bases shared between the defense and the civilian sectors,
the MOD has been considering the civilian use of aircraft
developed by the MOD from the perspective that taking
measures to contribute to the revitalization of the civilian
sector will contribute to maintaining and activating the
production and technological bases of Japanese aircraft,
and by extension, to maintaining and strengthening the
defense production and technological base in Japan. In
August 2010, the MOD compiled a set of guidelines for
the development of a concrete system for converting
aircraft to civilian use, while in 2011, it also developed the

5 Technology Control


In promoting defense equipment and technology
cooperation internationally, the MOD will properly
evaluate the sensitivity and strategic value of defense
technology and dual-use technology, and protect these
technologies that should be protected as strengths of


Japan. At the same time, from the perspective of Japan’s
security, the MOD will strengthen technology control in
cooperation with the Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry, in order to avoid the risk of the diversion of
technologies into weapons.

6 Participation in International Defense Equipment Exhibitions


From the viewpoint of promoting defense equipment
and technology cooperation, ATLA has participated in
international defense equipment exhibitions to introduce
Japan’s defense equipment policies and advanced
technology. These initiatives help foreign government
offi cials understand regarding Japan’s equipment policies
and technology.
ATLA has participated in international defense
equipment exhibitions such as Defense and Security
Equipment International (DSEI) held in London, United
Kingdom and Defense and Security (D&S) held in
Bangkok, Thailand as well as air shows held in Paris,
France and Dubai, United Arab Emirates in 2017 and
an air show held in Berlin, Germany in 2018. At these
events, ATLA widely disseminated information on the
policy measures taken by ATLA, the outcomes of research
and development through exhibitions of P-1 patrol
aircraft, C-2 transport aircraft and research prototypes of
unmanned equipment developed in Japan, and on advanced
technology possessed by Japanese manufacturers.
Moreover, taking this opportunity of government
offi cials gathered from different countries at these events,
meetings were held between high offi cials of various
countries including the State Minister of Defense and
Parliamentary Vice-Ministers of Defense from Japan.
Through these initiatives, ATLA was able to contribute to
forming the platform for promoting defense equipment
and technology cooperation by deepening other countries’
understanding of measures regarding defense equipment
and advanced technology in Japan.

March 2018.


The Public-Private Defense Industry Forum is held with a
purpose of promoting defense equipment and technology
cooperation with partner countries in the Asia-Pacifi c
region as a joint effort between the public and private
sectors. This forum is held to deepen understanding
of the relevant parties and facilitate concrete defense
equipment and technology cooperation in the future

interfere with unit activities, thus striving to foster
friendly interaction with local communities. The SDF
also provides transportation and other assistance at a
variety of athletic events. In addition, it supports regional
medical treatment efforts by providing general medical
care at some SDF hospitals as well as conducting urgent
transport for emergency patients from isolated islands.
Furthermore, based on national policy,[1] the MOD/SDF
ensures opportunities for local small and medium sized
enterprises to receive orders, while taking effi ciency into
account, by such measures as the promotion of separated/
divided ordering[2] and the securing of competition
amongst companies within the same qualifi cation and
grade divisions.[3]

[See] Reference 67 (Activities in Civic Life)


The MOD/SDF conducts activities to support the lives of
citizens in a range of fi elds, in response to requests from
local governments and relevant organizations. Such activities
contribute to further deepening the trust in the SDF, and
provide SDF personnel with pride and confi dence.
The GSDF handles the disposal of unexploded
ordnance and other dangerous explosives found
throughout Japan. In FY2017, there were approx. 1,611
such cases (approx. 49.5 tons). In particular, cases
handled in Okinawa Prefecture accounted for approx.
34% of the total cases. The MSDF clears and disposes
of underwater mines and other dangerous explosives,
and approx. 15,550 explosives (approx. 7.8 tons) were
handled in FY2017.
The SDF camps and bases allow the local residents
access to their facilities to the extent that it does not


2 Cooperation from Local Governments and Other Relevant Organizations for the SDF


Amid the harsh recruitment and employment situation,
the cooperation from local governments and relevant
organizations is vital to secure highly qualifi ed personnel
and to support the reemployment of uniformed SDF
personnel who retire at a relatively young age under the
SDF’s early retirement system.
The SDF camps and bases maintain close relations
with local communities, and therefore, various forms of


support and cooperation from the local community are
indispensable for the SDF to conduct its diverse activities,
including education and training, and disaster relief.
Moreover, units dispatched overseas for international
peace cooperation operations and other duties receive
support and cooperation from the relevant organizations
for the procedures involved.


“The Contract Basic Policy of the Government regarding Small and Medium Enterprises in FY2017” (Cabinet decision on July 25, 2017)

For example, this is a method through which grouping of products, etc. takes place when putting up the order for general competitive bidding, and then a successful bidder for the groups is decided.

between the defense facilities and the surrounding areas
as well as obtaining the understanding and cooperation of
the local residents. For that purpose, the MOD has taken
measures to promote harmony between defense facilities
and surrounding areas since 1974, based on the Act on
Improvement of Living Environment of Areas Around
Defense Facilities (Living Environment Improvement Act).

**(1) Measures based on the Act on Improvement of Living**
**Environment of Areas Around Defense Facilities**

Based on the Living Environment Improvement Act, the
MOD has implemented various measures to prevent,
alleviate, and mitigate impact such as aircraft noise in
the surrounding areas caused by the SDF or U.S. Forces
activities, or by establishing and operating defense
facilities including airfi elds. Furthermore, taking into
consideration the requests from the relevant local
governments, the MOD partially revised the Living
Environment Improvement Act in 2011, and conducted a
review to enable the Specifi ed Defense Facilities Environs
Improvement Adjustment Grants to be applied to socalled soft projects, such as aid for medical expenses.
In addition, the MOD added defense facilities to be
eligible for these grants. Focused work is also underway
to provide sound insulation at residences and efforts are
being made to ensure its further progress.

**Related Activities**


1 Various Public Relations Activities


As the activities of the MOD/SDF cannot be carried out
without the understanding and support of the Japanese
people, it is important to be proactive in undertaking
easily comprehensible public relations activities and to
gain the trust and cooperation of the public.
According to a “Public Opinion Survey on the SelfDefense Forces and Defense Issues” conducted by the
Cabinet Offi ce (in January 2018), the public expectations
and evaluations towards the SDF have been increasing
as the scope of MOD/SDF activities has expanded both
domestically and internationally. In light of this result,
the MOD/SDF will continue to conduct a variety of PR
activities, thereby striving to ensure better understanding
of the current status of the MOD/SDF.
In addition, given that understanding and support
from foreign countries are also of utmost importance
for the SDF to conduct its missions successfully, it is
essential that the MOD strengthens efforts to provide
information to foreign countries about MOD/SDF
initiatives, including about SDF activities abroad.

[See] Reference 68 (“Public Opinion Survey on the Self Defense

Forces and Defense Issues” (excerpt) (Public Relations Offi ce
of Cabinet Offi ce))


magazine, “Japan Defense Focus(JDF).” It is proactively
transmitting information to the international community
through efforts such as providing international media
with opportunities for press coverage, enhancement of the
English section of the MOD website, publishing English
versions of the defense white paper and brochures, as
well as producing PR videos.


2 Events and PR Facilities


The MOD/SDF conducts activities to widely inform
nationals of the current circumstances of the SDF. These
activities include the GSDF Fuji Fire Power Exercise,
cruises to experience MSDF vessels, and demonstration
fl ights and boarding experiences on aircraft. In addition,
at camps and bases throughout the country, events
including equipment exhibitions and unit tours are held on
occasions such as the anniversary of a unit’s foundation.
In some instances, they also hold parades throughout
the cities, with cooperation from the local communities.
Furthermore, as part of the commemoration of the
SDF anniversary, the SDF Marching Festival is held at
Nippon Budokan arena every year. The festival attracted
approximately 40,000 visitors in total in 2017.
Concerning annual reviews by the SDF, a troop
review, a fl eet review, and an air review are hosted in
rotation by the GSDF, MSDF, and ASDF respectively.
In 2017, an air review was planned to be held by the
ASDF at Hyakuri Airbase in commemoration of the
10th anniversary of the reorganization into the MOD

International Audiences


The MOD/SDF conducts PR activities using the Internet
such as offi cial websites, video distribution, and social
media (Social Networking Service)[1] as well as actively
distributes information through various means including
television broadcasting, large-sized billboards, and the
showing of PR videos on trains.
The MOD has also been making great efforts to
provide accurate information in a more extensive and
timely fashion, by creating brochures, PR videos, and
“Manga-Style Defense of Japan (Comic),” as well
as providing assistance in editing the PR magazine
“MAMOR” and cooperation on media coverage.
Furthermore, based on the increasing interest in the
MOD/SDF initiatives by the international community, the
MOD has been striving to gain the understanding of people
in other countries by publishing the monthly English

Gold medal in the Tokyo Olympics. I appreciate your continued support
and encouragement.

Second Lieutenant Naito Ehara
I managed to win a Bronze medal at the Rio Olympics with the support and encouragement
of many people. The Japanese team demonstrated its cohesiveness in the relay, however,
I discovered the need to foster more resilience in individual races. I am going to dedicate
myself to daily training with the goal of winning a medal in not only the relay, but also
in individual races at the Tokyo Olympics held in 2020 by fully utilizing the environment
provided by the JSDF Physical Training School.
Your continued encouragement is highly appreciated.

These programs are intended to promote participants’
understanding of the SDF by offering opportunities
to experience the daily life and training of the SDF, as
well as to have direct contact with SDF personnel. In


FY2017, approximately 150 people participated in SDF

2 Initiatives for Information Disclosure and Document Management


explanation, had never been released, even though disposal
of the relevant data was instructed. Based on the decision
by the Defense Minister that normal investigation would
not be enough considering the situation, a special defense
inspection was initiated by the Inspector General’s Offi ce
of Legal Compliance on March 17 and its result was
announced on July 28.
The result of the special defense inspection identifi es
improper conducts, including those leading to a violation
of MOD/SDF personnel of the Information Disclosure
Act. The MOD/SDF considers this result severe and
regrettable and should refl ect upon it.
The MOD considers that the underlying causes of
these problems were that there were not enough levels of
awareness on the importance of information disclosure
is within the MOD/SDF, and that there were not enough
levels of communication among relevant departments and
agencies within the ministry. In order not to repeat such
a case ever again, the MOD/SDF will be fully committed
to implementing measures to prevent the recurrence
of similar cases regarding information disclosure and
document management, while encouraging the personnel
to change their mindset, fostering transparent and open
culture in the organization and further enhancing the
collaboration among departments and agencies. In this
way, everyone at the MOD/SDF must work together and
make the utmost effort to regain the public confi dence.
a. Results of the Special Defense Inspection and
Relevant Matters
At the instruction of Defense Minister, the Inspector
General’s Offi ce of Legal Compliance had strictly
and fairly conducted a thorough investigation on the
management status of these daily reports[4] over the
period of four months starting from March 17, 2017,
from a highly independent standpoint, led by a former
superintendent prosecutor of a high public prosecutor’s
offi ce and also served by active prosecutors, which ended
with the announcement of the result on July 28, 2017.



Necessity of Appropriate Operation of
1
the Information Disclosure System


Democracy is founded on the principle that the public
has access to accurate information, thereby making
appropriate judgment and exercise of sovereignty.
Administrative documents held by the government are
of utmost importance for the public’s access to accurate
information, and it is an important responsibility for the
government to manage them in an appropriate manner
and respond to the public’s information disclosure
requests properly. Information held by the MOD/SDF is
no exception to this, the MOD/SDF bears this important
responsibility under the Act on Access to Information
Held by Administrative Organs.

2 Regarding Daily Reports of PKO in South Sudan,


The background of the issue over daily reports written
by SDF engineering units dispatched to South Sudan is
as follows. Concerning an information disclosure request
made on October 3, 2016, the MOD initially refused the
request after receiving the response submitted by the
Chief of Staff of the GSDF, with the explanation “not
disclosed because the corresponding documents do not
exist.” Later, however, the daily reports in question were
found within the Joint Staff Offi ce through the second
search conducted at the instructions from the Defense
Minister on December 26, 2016. Therefore, the MOD
publicly announced the fact on February 6, 2017, and
withdrew its initial decision, issuing a disclosure decision
(partial disclosure decision) instead on February 13.
Later, on March 15, the media reported that the daily
reports in data format had been retained in the GSDF,
but the fact, which was inconsistent with the initial


Tours to experience the daily life of the GSDF, MSDF, and ASDF. They are implemented upon request from private companies and other organizations through the Provincial Cooperation Offi ces.

The scope of this special defense inspection is the management status of the daily reports written for a period between July 7 and 12, 2016 (local time) by the engineering unit dispatched to South
Sudan, for which information disclosure request in accordance with the Act on Access to Information Held by Administrative Organs (Act No. 42 of 1999) was sought on October 3, 2016. To read the

(Overview))

b. Measures to Prevent the Recurrence
In response to what was pointed out in the results of
this special defense inspection which was announced on
July 28, 2017, the MOD/SDF has taken the following
measures to prevent the recurrence of similar cases.
❍ Handling of daily reports

-  Review of the retention period of daily reports (to be
retained for 10 years)
Ensure that all daily reports written by SDF units,
including those written by the engineering unit
dispatched to South Sudan will be retained for 10
years. After the retention period expires, they will be
transferred and archived under the management of the
National Archives of Japan.

-  Central management under the Joint Staff Councilor[5]

Ensure that the Joint Staff Councilor is responsible
for central management of these daily reports by
organizing and storing them in data format, and also
for centrally handling all subsequent information
disclosure requests.

-  Strengthening structure attached to the Joint Staff Councilor
To appropriately respond to information disclosure
requests, assign offi cials in charge of operating
information disclosure to the position attached to the
Joint Staff Councilor
❍ Information disclosure operation

-  Strengthening check function by establishing a new
post “Information Disclosure Inspector”
To evaluate the appropriateness of the judgement in a
strict manner regarding all cases for which disclosure
was rejected due to the absence of requested documents,
establish a new post of Information Disclosure
Inspector who is responsible for interviewing persons
involved and carry out on-site inspection at a division
that may possess the said document.

-  Regular verifi cation of the whole information
disclosure operation by the Inspector General’s Offi ce
of Legal Compliance
Ensure that the whole information disclosure operation
at the MOD/SDF is regularly inspected and verifi ed by
the Inspector General’s Offi ce of Legal Compliance.

-  Thorough review of all cases for which disclosure was
rejected due to the absence of relevant administrative
documents


Appoint a person in charge of information disclosure
at each organization with a document controller in
place. Ensure that accurate judgment is made in
document identifi cation through multiple reviews
and searches, even in cases where it was decided that
there was no corresponding document subject to an
information disclosure request.

-  Ensuring close cooperation and information sharing
among each of the Staff Offi ces, internal bureaus and
Administrative Vice Chief of Staff of Joint Staff, etc.
Considering the possibility that the document
subject to a disclosure request might be retained in
other organizations, each of the Staff Offi ces work
closely with relevant internal bureaus and try to share
information and further improve the accuracy of
document search and identifi cation.

-  Extensive and improved education and training to raise
personnel awareness
Raise awareness of the personnel by developing
subjects regarding information disclosure operation
for the personnel (senior offi cials in particular) in
various personnel training programs and make such
subjects mandatory, as well as prepare and distribute
the “Information Disclosure Handbook” describing
the procedures for information disclosure in an easyto-understand manner.
❍ Management of administrative documents

-  Review of retention period for documents including
reports regarding the SDF’s actions
Retain reports of actions based on various orders,
irrespective of domestic or overseas deployment that
will contribute to the decisions by the Minister of
Defense and senior offi cers for a period of 3 to 30
years depending on the document type, and after the
retention period expires, transfer them to the National
Archives of Japan.

-  Ensuring the appropriateness of document management
of the entire ministry
Require each organization to consult with the supervising
document controller (Director-General of the Secretariat)
about preparing or modifying its guidelines for standard
document retention periods. Also implement measures,
including appropriate labeling of handling types of
administrative documents, thorough management of
appropriate access control, clarifi cation of an expiration
date of a retention period, and clear defi nition of a
responsible department in the case of administrative
documents shared by two or more departments.


The Joint Staff Councilor was the title then. It was divided into Principal Joint Staff Councilor and Joint Staff Councilor on April 1, 2018, responsible for centrally managing all documents including


-----

-  Personnel education
To make these measures fully known and understood
by the personnel, prepare the manual for them and
hand it out to all of them, as well as provide individual
training for senior offi cials and working-level offi cials
in charge of document management across the
organization, including regional organizations.
In addition, as for the management of
administrative documents, the MOD also review rules,
including the MOD regulations on administrative
documents management in light of the revised
Guidelines on Administrative Document Management
(signed by Prime Minister on April 1, 2011, hereinafter
called the “New Guidelines”), and make such rules
fully known and understood by the personnel.


4 Daily Reports in Iraq and Relevant issues

In the efforts to achieve centralized management for all
regular reports,[6] including daily reports, under the Joint
Staff Councilor,[7] as part of the recurrence prevention
measures which resulted from refl ections on the South
Sudan PKO daily report issue. Extremely inappropriate
handling over the daily reports in Iraq was also identifi ed.[8]

Among them, with regard to the background of
the reports found at the GSDF Ground Research and
Development Command (the department of the time,
hereinafter the same shall apply.),[9] it has found that the
daily reports in Iraq were found on March 27, 2017, to
be kept at the GSDF Ground Research and Development
Command, just when the re-searching had been underway
at the instruction by the Defense Minister from February
22, 2017, and nevertheless, said discovery had not been
reported to the Defense Minister (which was announced
on April 4, 2018). As there was the possibility that this case
entailed a grave problem that might affect civilian control,
at the instruction of Defense Minister Onodera, the MOD
decided on April 4, 2018 to initiate an investigation by
the “investigation team on ‘Daily Reports’ of GSDF in
Iraq” which was head by Parliamentary Vice-Minister of
Defense Ohno Keitaro.[10] Furthermore, in this process, the
investigation on the background of the cases in (b), (c)
and (d) listed below had also been put in place.
The investigation indicates that the MOD/SDF had
not responded to the instruction of Defense Minister in
an appropriate manner, made inappropriate responses
to questions, document requests, information disclosure
requests from the Diet members, and failed to promptly
correct such actions thereafter. The MOD regards them as
a problem to be refl ected upon.
The investigation has not identifi ed any inappropriate
intentions in performing paperwork in connection with
the instructions by the Defense Minister or questions
at the Diet. The daily reports in question were found
and publicly announced while taking the recurrence
prevention measures under the instruction of the Defense
Minister. In addition, it is not considered that there was
any conduct that constitutes violation of any resolutions


Initiatives for Appropriate Management of
3
Public Documents


Following the issue over public documents, at the
informal meeting of Cabinet members on March 23,
2018, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe instructed the members
to immediately work on the following two points: (i) for
senior offi cials to take initiative in ensuring that all
offi cials will understand and abide by strict rules under
the New Guidelines effective from April 2018 and
(ii) accelerate the transition to an electronic approval
system designed for strict management of document
history such as update information.
Prior to this instruction, on March 12, at the MOD,
Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera instructed senior
offi cials to bear in mind once again the importance of
information disclosure, management of administrative
documents, and information protection while performing
their duties. Then upon the instruction of Prime Minister
as mentioned above, the minister reminded them to ensure
that all administrative documents would be managed
properly in accordance with the New Guidelines, and
ensure that all the personnel would be aware of the need to
accelerate the transition to an electronic approval system,
thereby making efforts to manage all the documents in an
appropriate fashion.


6 Regular reports produced for senior offi cers (including command headquarters) by units carrying out actions based on deployment orders that will contribute to the decisions by the Minister of Defense
and the senior offi cers.

7 See footnote 5.

8 This case was triggered by the fact that a part of the Iraq daily reports were found at the Ground Staff Offi ce's medical department and the Research and Development Command (which was
announced on April 2, 2017), but with regard to the said reports, the Defense Minister previously responded in the Diet that the MOD searched for retained daily reports of the unit in Iraq but failed
to fi nd any of them.

9 The Ground Research and Development Command was reorganized into Japan Ground Self Defense Force Training Evaluation Research and Development Command on March 27, 2018.

10 At a later date, the MOD decided to conduct an investigation with assistance from a lawyer, a former superintending prosecutor of the Tokyo High Public Prosecutors Offi ce. The investigation team
visited the Japan Ground Self Defense Force Training Evaluation Research and Development Command to collect documents and other materials and check computers of relevant offi cials and fi les
of administrative documents, in addition, the team conducted interviews with approximately 70 people and questionnaires to approximately 400 people. The team held 34 meetings in total until the


-----

c. Background of the Discovery of Daily Reports at the GSDF
International Peace Cooperation Activities Training Unit
Regarding this matter, the investigation concluded that it
was considered inappropriate that adequate search had not
been conducted in response to the document request from
the Diet member, and thus the response was provided to
the effect that the MOD did not retain the daily reports;
and it was also considered inappropriate that even when
the reports were found through the special defense
inspection and the information disclosure request, any
necessary effort to correct the response provided to the
document request or the answers to the Diet questions
had not been made thereafter.
d. Background of the Discovery of the Daily Reports from
Iraq at the Air Staff Offi ce
Within the ASDF, any daily reports from Iraq were not
found in the searches conducted in February, August,
and March 2018, but in April 2018, the daily reports
from Iraq for 3 days were found. This is not considered
appropriate as daily reports in its procession were not
fully understood by the ASDF.
e. Measures to prevent the recurrence[13]

Based on the facts made clear through the investigation,
the MOD publicly announced the investigation report
on May 23, 2018, imposed strict disciplinary measures
against Administrative Vice-Minister of Defense and 16
relevant subordinates concerned, and also announced the
following measures to prevent the recurrence of similar
cases. In the meantime, at the meeting of Cabinet members
regarding the ideal management of public documents held
on June 8, 2018, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe instructed
the Cabinet members to lead the initiative in taking all
possible measures to ensure proper management of public
documents. Accordingly, the MOD will fully implement
these measures to prevent the recurrence and do every
effort to regain the public’s confi dence in the MOD/SDF.
❍ Strengthening of Structure in Charge of Performing
Minister’s Instruction and Order

-  Specify in writing important instructions and operational
orders, etc. from Defense Minister, and senior offi cials.

-  Require the above instructions, etc., to be notifi ed to
the division chief or offi cial in the equivalent position,
as well as require relevant responses to be approved by
the division chief or offi cial in the equivalent position.

-  If such instructions, etc., are made, a responsible
department or bureau to notify the Minister's Secretariat
of implementation and coordination status is required.


or approvals in the Diet. With such things considered
the MOD concludes that there was no issue that could
undermine civilian control itself. That said, the MOD
must take it seriously that the case in question gave rise
to concerns and distrust for civilian control among the
public. The results of each investigation were announced
on May 23, 2018, and are summarized as follows:
a. Investigation on Daily Reports in Iraq[11]

When the special defense inspection on the daily reports
of the PKO unit in South Sudan had been underway, the
existence of the daily reports from Iraq retained at the
GSDF Ground Research and Development Command
was identifi ed. As for this matter, the investigation found
that the e-mail that notices the instructions about researching by the Defense Minister was not clear enough
for the recipients to understand the message as intended.
In addition, it was also found that suffi cient searches
had not been conducted in response to the information
disclosure request, and appropriate paperwork had not
been performed. For such reasons, the existence of the
daily reports in Iraq was not reported to the Defense
Minister. As a result, this indicates that the MOD/SDF
did not properly respond to the instruction of the Defense
Minister, and took inappropriate responses to questions,
document requests, and information disclosure requests
from the Diet, and failed to promptly correct such
response thereafter. This is extremely regrettable.
b. Background of the Report to Minister by Joint Staff
Councilor and Others Regarding the Daily Reports
from Iraq[12]
Regarding this matter, the investigation has found that:
Since the Joint Staff Offi ce identifi ed the existence of
the daily reports from the units dispatched to Iraq on
March 2, 2018, the Joint Staff Councilor and relevant
departments had taken all the necessary steps, including
close examination of the reports found, coordination
with relevant departments in connection with matters
to be reported to Defense Minister, double-checking for
any daily reports left unsearched, and confi rmation on
response status about document requests and information
disclosure requests from Diet members. After all these
steps on March 31, the MOD provided the explanation
to the Defense Minister. In retrospect however, if
such a problem was identifi ed, the MOD should have
immediately informed the minister thereof. Accordingly,
this response is not considered appropriate.

❍ Appropriate response to administrative document
management and information disclosure by maintaining
such documents as electronic fi les.

-  Accelerate the transition to an electronic approval system

-  Require all the personnel to notify a responsible person
at a division in charge, etc., of the response status
❍ Reinforce the check system for administrative
document management and information disclosure

-  Establish a new organization responsible for inspection
of administrative document management and
information disclosure[14]

-  Build a framework to receive instructions and advising
from external experts
❍ Reform a mindset of individual SDF personnel
regarding administrative document management and
information disclosure

-  Develop extensive training programs designed to
help SDF personnel improve necessary judgment in
performing operations

-  Consider designating administrative document
management and information disclosure as part of
criteria for personnel performance appraisal

3 Initiatives for Policy Evaluation


❍ Create an organization capable of the prompt and
accurate response to information disclosure, etc.

-  Examine a system to centrally retain and control
administrative documents in the electronic format.

-  Reinforce exclusive structure, particularly at the Joint
Staff Offi ce. As part of this, reemploy retired SDF
personnel with expertise on administrative document
management and information disclosure for daily
reports and other documents as part-time offi cials.

3 Initiatives for the Personal Data Protection System


The MOD has been conducting the evaluation of various
policies based on its policy evaluation system. In FY2017,
the MOD conducted policy evaluations of R&D programs
and projects concerning taxation special measures as well
as the major policies and programs of the NDPG and the
Mid-Term Defense Program (MTDP).


In light of respecting individual rights in line with the
Act on the Protection of Personal Information Held by
Administrative Organs, the MOD takes measures to
ensure the security of the personal information under its
control, and discloses such information upon request.

2 Promotion of Evidence-Based Policy Making


In order to promote Evidence-Based Policy Making
(EBPM), the MOD has worked on the establishment of
the structure for promotion of EBPM within the ministry,
including the establishment of a new position, “DirectorGeneral for Evidence-based Policymaking,” who plays a
central role of the EBPM in FY2018.


The MOD sets up a system to handle whistleblowing
made by its offi cials, employees and outside workers,
establishing internal contact desks to deal with
whistleblowing and to protect whistleblower.

Reference 5 National Security Strategy (Outline)

(Approved by the National Security Council
and the Cabinet on December 17, 2013)
**I. Purpose**
❍ As Japan’s security environment becomes ever more severe, Japan
needs to identify its national interests from a long-term perspective,
determine the course it should pursue in the international community,
and adopt a whole-government approach for national security policies
and measures in order to continue developing a prosperous and peaceful
society.
❍ In a world where globalization continues, Japan should play an even
more proactive role as a major global player in the international
community.
❍ The Strategy, as fundamental policies pertaining to national security,
presents guidelines for policies in areas related to national security.
❍ With the National Security Council (NSC) serving as the control
tower, as well as with strong political leadership, the Government of
Japan will implement national security policies in a more strategic and
structured manner through a whole-government approach.
❍ When implementing policies in other areas, the Government of Japan
will give due consideration to national security so that Japan can utilize
its strengths, such as its diplomatic ability and defense capability, in a
smooth and fully-functional way as a whole, based on the Strategy.
❍ The Strategy will guide Japan’s national security policy over the next
decade. Through the implementation of concrete policies, the NSC will
regularly carry out systematic evaluation and upgrade the Strategy in a
timely and appropriate manner.
**II. Fundamental Principle of National Security**
1. Principles Japan Upholds
❍ Japan is a country with rich culture and tradition, and upholds universal
values, such as freedom, democracy, respect for fundamental human
rights and the rule of law. Japan has a wealth of highly educated human
capital and high cultural standards, and is an economic power with
strong economic capacity and high technological capabilities. Japan
has achieved its development benefiting from an open international
economic system. In addition, Japan as a maritime state has pursued
“Open and Stable Seas.”
❍ Japan has consistently followed the path of a peace-loving nation
since the end of World War II, and has adhered to a basic policy of
maintaining an exclusively national defense-oriented policy, not
becoming a military power that poses a threat to other countries, and
observing the Three Non-Nuclear Principles.
❍ Japan has maintained its security, and contributed to peace and stability
in the Asia-Pacific region, by enhancing its alliance with the United
States (U.S.), as well as by deepening cooperative relationships with
other countries. Japan has also contributed to the realization of stability
and prosperity in the international community through initiatives
for supporting the economic growth of developing countries and for
addressing global issues based on the principle of human security, as
well as through trade and investment relations with other countries.
❍ Complying with the United Nations (U.N.) Charter, Japan has been
cooperating with the U.N. and other international organizations, and
has actively contributed to their activities. Japan has also continuously
participated in international peace cooperation activities. In addition, as
the only country to have ever suffered atomic bombings in war, Japan
has consistently engaged in disarmament and non-proliferation efforts,
playing a leading role in international initiatives to realize “a world free
of nuclear weapons.”
❍ Japan will continue to adhere to the course that it has taken to date


economy, contribute even more proactively in securing peace, stability,
and prosperity of the international community, while achieving its own
security as well as peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, as a
“Proactive Contributor to Peace” based on the principle of international
cooperation. This is the fundamental principle of national security that
Japan should stand to hold.
2. Japan’s National Interests and National Security Objectives
National Interests
❍ To maintain its sovereignty and independence; to defend its territorial
integrity; to ensure the safety of life, person, and properties of its
nationals, and to ensure its survival while maintaining its own peace
and security and preserving its rich culture and tradition.
❍ To achieve the prosperity of Japan and its nationals through economic
development, thereby consolidating its peace and security (to this end,
it is essential that Japan strengthens the free trade regime and realizes
an international environment that offers stability, transparency and
predictability).
❍ To maintain and protect international order based on rules and universal
values, such as freedom, democracy, respect for fundamental human
rights, and the rule of law.
National Security Objectives
❍ To strengthen the deterrence necessary for maintaining Japan’s peace
and security and for ensuring its survival, thus deterring threats from
directly reaching Japan; at the same time, if by any chance a threat
should reach Japan, to defeat such threat and to minimize the damage.
❍ To improve the security environment of the Asia-Pacific region,
and prevent the emergence of and reduce direct threats to Japan,
through strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance, enhancing the trust
and cooperative relationships between Japan and its partners within
and outside the Asia-Pacific region, and promoting practical security
cooperation.
❍ To improve the global security environment and build a peaceful,
stable, and prosperous international community by strengthening the
international order based on universal values and rules, and by playing a
leading role in the settlement of disputes, through consistent diplomatic
efforts and further personnel contributions.
**III. Security Environment Surrounding Japan and National Security Challenges**
1. Global Security Environment and Challenges
(1) Shift in the Balance of Power and Rapid Progress of Technological
Innovation
❍ The balance of power between nations is changing due to the rise
of emerging countries (e.g., China and India). In particular, China
is increasing its presence in the international community. The
United States, which has the world’s largest power as a whole, has
manifested its policy to shift its emphasis of national security and
economic policy towards the Asia-Pacific region.
❍ The rapid advancement of globalization and technological innovation
has increased the relative influence of non-state actors, and the threat
of terrorism and crimes committed by non-state actors is expanding.
(2) Threat of the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and Other
Related Materials
❍ The issue of the transfer, proliferation, and performance improvement
of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their means of delivery,
such as ballistic missiles, the issue of nuclear and missile development
by North Korea, and the nuclear issue of Iran remain major threats to
Japan and the international community.
(3) Threat of International Terrorism
❍ International terrorism has spread and become diverse in its forms
due to the advancement of globalization.
❍ Terrorist attacks against Japanese nationals and interests have


-----

actually taken place overseas. Japan and its people face the threat of
international terrorism both at home and abroad.
(4) Risks to Global Commons
❍ In recent years, risks that can impede the utilization of and free access
to global commons, such as the sea, outer space, and cyberspace, have
been spreading and become more serious.
❍ In the seas, in recent years, there have been an increasing number
of cases of unilateral actions in an attempt to change the status quo
by coercion with respect to natural resources and the security of
respective states.
❍ Due to these cases as well as piracy and other issues, there is a
growing risk of the stability of sea lanes and freedom of navigation
coming under threat.
❍ There exist risks that could impede the continuous and stable use of
outer space, including an increasing amount of space debris caused
by satellite collisions amongst others.
❍ Risks of cyber-attacks with the intent to disrupt critical infrastructure
and obstruct military systems are becoming more serious.
(5) Challenges to Human Security
❍ Global issues that cannot be dealt with by a single country—namely,
poverty, widening inequality, global health challenges including
infectious diseases, climate change and other environmental issues,
food security, and humanitarian crises caused by civil wars and
natural disasters—are emerging as critical and urgent issues of human
security, threatening the very survival and dignity of individuals.
❍ These challenges could have repercussions on peace and stability of
the international community.
(6) The Global Economy and Its Risks
❍ The risk of the expansion of an economic crisis from one country to
the entire global economy is growing.
❍ Signs of protectionism and reluctance towards the creation of new
trade rules are becoming apparent.
❍ The rise of resource nationalism in resource rich countries as well as
an intensified competition for the acquisition of energy and mineral
resources by emerging countries are observed.
2. Security Environment and Challenges in the Asia-Pacific Region
(1) Characteristics of the Strategic Environment of the Asia-Pacific Region
❍ The region has various political regimes and a host of countries with
large-scale military forces including nuclear-weapon states. Yet a
regional cooperation framework in the security realm has not been
sufficiently institutionalized.
(2) North Korea’s Military Buildup and Provocative Actions
❍ North Korea has enhanced the capability of WMDs including nuclear
weapons and that of ballistic missiles. At the same time, North Korea
has repeatedly taken provocative military actions including the use
of provocative rhetoric against Japan and other countries, thereby
increasing the tension in the region. The threat to the security of Japan
and of other countries is being substantially aggravated.
❍ As Kim Jong-un proceeds to consolidate his regime, the domestic
situation in North Korea needs to be closely monitored.
❍ North Korea’s abduction is a grave issue affecting Japan’s sovereignty
as well as the lives and safety of Japanese nationals. It is an urgent
issue for the Government of Japan to resolve under its responsibility.
(3) China’s Rapid Rise and Intensified Activities in Various Areas
❍ There is an expectation for China to share and comply with
international norms, and play a more active and cooperative role for
regional and global issues.
❍ China has been rapidly advancing its military capabilities in a wide
range of areas without sufficient transparency.
❍ China has taken actions that can be regarded as attempts to change
the status quo by coercion based on their own assertions, which
are incompatible with the existing order of international law, in the
maritime and aerial domains, including the East China Sea and the
South China Sea (e.g., intrusion into Japan’s territorial waters and
airspace around the Senkaku Islands, establishment of its own “Air
Defense Identification Zone”).
❍ The cross-strait relationship has deepened economically. Meanwhile,
the military balance has been changing. Thus, the relationship
contains both orientations towards stability and potential instability.
**IV. Japan’s Strategic Approaches to National Security**
1. Strengthening and Expanding Japan’s Capabilities and Roles

-  To ensure national security, Japan needs to first and foremost strengthen
its own capabilities and the foundation for exercising those capabilities.
Japan must also steadily fulfill the role it should play and adapt its
capabilities to respond to future developments.

-  Enhancing Japan’s resilience in national security, through reinforcing its
diplomatic power and defense force, as well as bolstering its economic
strengths and technological capabilities, contributes to peace and stability
in the Asia-Pacific region and the international community at large.

-  In order to overcome national security challenges and achieve national
security objectives, as well as to proactively contribute to peace in


cooperation with the international community, Japan needs to expand
and deepen cooperative relationships with other countries, with the
Japan-U.S. Alliance as the cornerstone. At the same time, Japan
needs to make effective use of its diverse resources and promote
comprehensive policies.
(1) Strengthening Diplomacy for Creating a Stable International
Environment
❍ The key of national security is to create a stable and predictable
international environment, and prevent the emergence of threats.
❍ It is necessary for Japan to realize an international order and security
environment that are desirable for Japan, by playing an even more
proactive role in achieving peace and stability of the international
community as a “Proactive Contributor to Peace” based on the
principle of international cooperation.
❍ It is necessary to enhance diplomatic creativity and negotiating
power to deepen the understanding of and garner support for Japan’s
position in the international community.
❍ By highlighting Japan’s attractiveness, Japan needs to strengthen its
soft power that would benefit the international community. Japan also
needs to strengthen its capacity to promptly and accurately identify
the needs of Japanese nationals and firms to support their overseas
activities.
❍ Japan will make even more proactive contributions to international
organizations such as the U.N., including through increasing the
number of Japanese staff in such institutions.
(2) Building a Comprehensive Defense Architecture to Firmly Defend
Japan
❍ Amid the severe security environment, Japan will efficiently develop
a highly effective joint defense force, adapting to the change in
strategic environment with consideration of its national power, and
strive to ensure operations with flexibility and readiness based on
joint operations.
❍ Japan will advance coordination within the government and with local
governments and the private sector. In doing so, even in peacetime,
Japan will maintain and improve a comprehensive architecture for
responding seamlessly to an array of situations, ranging from armed
attacks to large-scale natural disasters.
❍ In developing the structure of the Japan Self-Defense Forces (SDF),
which plays a central role in these efforts, Japan will enhance its
defense structure for deterrence and response to various situations,
prioritizing important functions from a joint and comprehensive
perspective.
❍ With regard to the threat of nuclear weapons, the extended deterrence
of the U.S. with nuclear deterrence at its core is indispensable. In order
to maintain and enhance the credibility of the extended deterrence,
Japan will work closely with the U.S., and take appropriate measures
through its own efforts, including ballistic missile defense (BMD)
and protection of the people.
(3) Strengthening Efforts for the Protection of Japan’s Territorial Integrity
❍ Japan will enhance the capabilities of the law enforcement agencies
responsible for territorial patrol activities and reinforce its maritime
surveillance capabilities.
❍ Japan will strengthen coordination among relevant ministries and
agencies to be able to respond seamlessly to a variety of unexpected
situations.
❍ Japan will proactively engage in the protection, management, and
development of remote islands near national borders, and from a
national security viewpoint, review issues related to the use of land
in areas such as remote islands near national borders and areas
surrounding defense facilities.
(4) Ensuring Maritime Security
❍ As a maritime state, Japan will play a leading role, in maintaining
and developing “Open and Stable Seas,” which are upheld by
maritime order based upon such fundamental principles as the rule
of law, ensuring the freedom and safety of navigation and overflight,
and peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with relevant
international law, rather than by force.
❍ Japan will strengthen its maritime domain awareness capabilities in
a comprehensive manner that involves the use of outer space, while
paying attention to the establishment of international networks.
❍ Japan will provide assistance to those coastal states alongside the sea
lanes of communication and other states in enhancing their maritime
law enforcement capabilities, and strengthen cooperation with
partners on the sea lanes who share strategic interests with Japan.
(5) Strengthening Cyber Security
❍ Japan as a whole will make concerted efforts to defend cyberspace
and strengthen the response capability against cyber-attacks, so as to
protect cyberspace from malicious activities; to ensure the free and
safe use of cyberspace; and to guard Japan’s critical infrastructure
against cyber-attacks, including those in which state involvement is
suspected.

Reference 6 NATIONAL DEFENSE PROGRAM GUIDELINES for FY2014
and beyond

(Approved by the National Security Council
and the Cabinet on December 17, 2013)
Stipulations regarding the National Defense Program Guidelines for FY2014
and Beyond are included in the reference.
Accordingly, the National Defense Program Guidelines for FY2011 and
Beyond (approved by the Cabinet on December 17, 2010) are discontinued as
of the end of FY2013.
(Additional reference)
National Defense Program Guidelines for FY2014 and beyond
**I. NDPG’s Objective**
In light of the current security environment surrounding Japan, the Government
of Japan sets out the “National Defense Program Guidelines for FY2014 and
beyond” as new guidelines for Japan’s national defense, based on “Defense
Capability Build-up in FY2013” (approved by the Security Council and the
Cabinet on January 25, 2013) and the “National Security Strategy” (approved
by the National Security Council and the Cabinet on December 17, 2013).
**II. Security Environment Surrounding Japan**
1. As interdependence among countries expands and deepens, there is a
growing risk that unrest in the global security environment or a security
problem in a single country or region could immediately develop into
a security challenge or destabilizing factor for the entire international
community. The multi-polarization of the world continues as a result of
shifts in the balance of power due to the further development of countries
such as China and India and the relative change of influence of the United
States (U.S.). At the same time, the U.S. is expected to continue to play
the role in maintaining world peace and stability as it retains the largest
national power.
There are ongoing regional conflicts involving various countries as
well as an increase in the number of so-called “gray-zone” situations, that
is, neither pure peacetime nor contingencies over territory, sovereignty
and maritime economic interests.
The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and
ballistic missiles continues to be a deep concern despite non-proliferation
efforts by the international community. The presence of countries with
weak governance and failed states feeds the expansion and spread of
international terrorism. These problems continue to pose imminent
security challenges


-----

In the maritime domain, piracy acts have taken place in various parts
of the world, and there have been cases where coastal states unilaterally
asserted their rights and took action based on their own assertion
concerning international maritime law, thereby unduly infringing the
freedom of the high seas.
Securing the stable use of outer space and cyberspace as global
commons is becoming a significant security challenge for the international
community including Japan against the backdrop of rapid technology
innovation. In addition, military strategies and military balance in the
future are anticipated to be significantly affected by the progress and
proliferation of technologies such as those related to precision guided
munitions, unmanned vehicles, stealth capability and nanotechnology.
2. In the Asia-Pacific region, including areas surrounding Japan, countries
are enhancing and strengthening their cooperative relationships to
resolve security challenges. Specific and practical cooperation and
collaboration have progressed to settle challenges particularly in nontraditional security fields. In the meantime, gray-zone situations over
territory, sovereignty and maritime economic interests tend to linger,
raising concerns that they may develop into more serious situations.
North Korea is military-focused and deploys a massive military
force. It is also proceeding with the development, deployment and
proliferation of WMDs including nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles
which may be used to deliver such weapons, and it maintains a largescale special operations force. Through these activities, North Korea is
maintaining and strengthening its asymmetrical military capabilities.
North Korea has also repeatedly heightened tension in the region
by conducting military provocations in the Korean Peninsula and by
escalating its provocative rhetoric and behavior against Japan and
other countries. Such North Korean military trend constitutes a serious
destabilizing factor to the security not only of Japan but of the entire
region and the international community. Therefore, Japan needs to pay
utmost attention to such activities.
In particular, North Korea’s ballistic missile development has
presumably entered a new stage, as technological improvements have
been made to extend the range and increase the accuracy of its missiles
through a series of missile launches. Also, North Korea has conducted
nuclear tests in defiance of calls for restraint from the international
community, so the possibility cannot be ruled out that it has successfully
miniaturized nuclear weapons for warheads and equipped them on
ballistic missiles. North Korea’s nuclear and missile development,
coupled with its provocative rhetoric and behavior, such as suggesting
a missile attack on Japan, pose a serious and imminent threat to Japan’s
security.
As for China, while it is greatly expected to play an active role
in a more cooperative manner in the region and the world, it has been
continuously increasing its defense expenditures and has been rapidly
reinforcing its military in a wide range of areas. As part of such effort,
China is believed to be making efforts to strengthen its asymmetrical
military capabilities to prevent military activity by other countries in
the region by denying access and deployment of foreign militaries to its
surrounding areas. However, China has not clearly stated the purposes
and goals of the military buildup and therefore, transparency concerning
its military and security is not fully achieved.
In addition, China is rapidly expanding and intensifying its
activities in the maritime and aerial domains in the region including in
the East China Sea and the South China Sea. In particular, China has
taken assertive actions with regard to issues of conflicts of interest in
the maritime domain, as exemplified by its attempts to change the status
quo by coercion. As for the seas and airspace around Japan, China
has intruded into Japanese territorial waters frequently and violated
Japan’s airspace, and has engaged in dangerous activities that could
cause unexpected situations, such as its announcement of establishing
an “Air Defense Identification Zone” based on its own assertion thereby
infringing the freedom of overflight above the high seas.
China is also expanding and intensifying its activities in the maritime
and aerial domains farther offshore than before. For example, Chinese
military vessels and aircraft routinely enter the Pacific Ocean, and are
expanding their operational areas which include areas north of Japan.
As Japan has great concern about these Chinese activities, it will
need to pay utmost attention to them, as these activities also raise
concerns over regional and global security.
As for Russia, it is observed that the country is proceeding to reform
and modernize its military forces mainly by strengthening their readiness
and introducing new equipment. The activities of Russian armed forces
have been active.
The U.S. has clearly manifested its strategic decision to put greater
emphasis on the Asia-Pacific region (the rebalance to the Asia-Pacific
region) and is maintaining and strengthening its engagement and
presence in the region despite fiscal and various other constraints in
order to maintain the stability and growth of the region while enhancing
its relationships with its allies and expanding cooperation with partner


countries. In addition, the U.S. has made its stance clear to prevent
coercive actions that aim at changing the status quo in the region in
cooperation with allies and partners.
3. Japan is surrounded by the sea, and has a long coastline, numerous
remote islands and a vast Exclusive Economic Zone. Japan is a maritime
state and dependent largely on international trade for its supply of food
and natural resources. Therefore, securing the safety of maritime and air
traffic, through strengthening an “Open and Stable Seas” order based
upon such fundamental principles as the rule of law and the freedom of
navigation, constitutes the basis of peace and prosperity.
Japan also faces security vulnerabilities resulting from concentration
of industry, population and information infrastructure in urban areas and
from the presence of a large number of key facilities, such as nuclear
power plants, in coastal areas. In the event of another massive earthquake
like the Great East Japan Earthquake, Japan may suffer enormous
damage and the impact may spread not only nationwide but also to other
countries. The possibility of future huge earthquakes such as a Nankai
Trough earthquake or a Tokyo inland earthquake makes it increasingly
necessary to take every possible measure to prepare for large-scale
disasters.
4. In light of the above, while the probability of a large-scale military conflict
between major countries, which was a concern during the Cold War era,
presumably remains low, various security challenges and destabilizing
factors are emerging and becoming more tangible and acute. As a result,
the security environment surrounding Japan has become increasingly
severe, since the formulation of “National Defense Program Guidelines,
FY2011 and beyond” (approved by the Security Council and the Cabinet
on December 17, 2010). As the security challenges and destabilizing
factors are diverse and wide-ranging, it is difficult for a single country to
deal with them on its own. Under these circumstances, it is increasingly
necessary not only that the military sector cooperate with the nonmilitary sector but also that countries which share interests in responding
to shared security challenges cooperate and actively respond to maintain
regional and global stability.
**III. Japan’s Basic Defense Policy**
1. Basic Policy
In light of the National Security Strategy, Japan will strengthen its
diplomatic and defense capabilities along the policy of “Proactive
Contribution to Peace” based on the principle of international
cooperation, thereby expanding the role it can play. At the same time,
Japan will contribute even more proactively in securing peace, stability
and prosperity of the international community while achieving its own
security as well as peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region by
expanding and deepening cooperative relationships with other countries,
with the Japan-U.S. Alliance as its cornerstone.
Under this basic principle, Japan will build a comprehensive defense
architecture and strengthen its posture for preventing and responding
to various situations. In addition, Japan will strengthen the JapanU.S. Alliance and actively promote bilateral and multilateral security
cooperation with other countries while closely coordinating defense and
diplomatic policies. Japan will also seek to establish an infrastructure
necessary for its defense forces to fully exercise their capabilities.
When implementing these measures, under the Constitution,
Japan will efficiently build a highly effective and joint defense force
in line with the basic principles of maintaining an exclusively defenseoriented policy, not becoming a military power that poses a threat to
other countries, while adhering to the principle of civilian control of the
military and observing the Three Non-Nuclear Principles.
With regard to the threat of nuclear weapons, the extended deterrence
provided by the U.S. with nuclear deterrence at its core, is indispensable.
In order to maintain and enhance the credibility of the extended
deterrence, Japan will closely cooperate with the U.S. In addition, Japan
will take appropriate responses through its own efforts, including ballistic
missile defense (BMD) and protection of the people. At the same time,
Japan will play a constructive and active role in international nuclear
disarmament and non-proliferation efforts so as to achieve the long-term
goal of creating a world free of nuclear weapons.
2. Japan’s Own Efforts
Recognizing that a country’s security depends first and foremost on
its independent efforts, Japan will make full-scale efforts on its own
initiative to prevent various situations and will seamlessly respond to
them as the situation evolves with the National Security Council as the
control tower, while maintaining cooperation with its ally, partners and
other countries concerned.
(1) Building a comprehensive defense architecture
Given the increasingly severe security environment, Japan will
efficiently develop a highly effective joint defense force and make
efforts to employ it with a high level of flexibility and readiness based
on joint operations. Japan will also ensure close regular interagency
cooperation in normal times. In the event of various situations, the
Government, under strong political leadership, will appropriately and


-----

promptly make decisions. Japan will seamlessly respond to situations
as they unfold, in a whole-of-the-government approach, to ensure the
protection of the lives and property of its people and the sovereignty
of Japan’s territorial land, waters and airspace, in coordination with
local governments, private sectors, and others.
Japan will also continue to develop various systems to respond
to a variety of disasters and protect its people and will enhance
the capability to quickly evacuate Japanese nationals from foreign
countries in an emergency situation and ensure their safety.
In order to take such approaches appropriately, Japan will
increase the effectiveness of its situation and disaster response posture
by systemizing various related plans and formulating and reviewing
them as well as expanding the use of simulations, comprehensive
training and exercises.
(2) Japan’s defense forces – building a Dynamic Joint Defense Force
Japan’s defense forces are the ultimate guarantee of national security,
and represent Japan’s will and ability to deter threats from directly
reaching Japan and defeat them if threats should reach Japan.
In the times of an ever-changing security environment
surrounding Japan, defense forces need to be constantly reviewed to
adapt to the environment. To this aim, Japan needs to allocate limited
resources in a focused and flexible way to prioritize the functions
and capabilities from a comprehensive perspective, identified through
joint operation-based capability assessments of the Self-Defense
Force’s (SDF’s) total functions and capabilities against various
situations.
Amid the increasingly severe security environment surrounding
Japan, the SDF, in addition to its regular activities, needs to respond
to various situations, including “gray zone” situations which require
SDF commitment. The frequency of such situations and the duration
of responses are both increasing. Therefore, Japan will regularly
conduct persistent intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance
(hereinafter “ISR”) activities. Moreover, the SDF will conduct
strategic training and exercises in accordance with the development of
the situation and swiftly build a response posture including advance
deployment of units in response to the security environment and
rapid deployment of adequate units. Thus Japan will demonstrate its
will and highly developed capability to prevent further escalation. In
dealing with situations, depending on their development, minimizing
damage by effective response through achieving maritime supremacy
and air superiority is essential in safeguarding the lives and property
of the Japanese people, and the sovereignty of Japan’s territorial land,
waters and airspace.
Therefore, Japan will enhance its deterrence and response
capability by improving the mission-capable rate of equipment and
its employment to conduct tailored activities swiftly and sustainably
based on joint operations, as well as by developing defense capabilities
adequate both in quantity and quality that underpin various activities
to realize a more robust defense force.
At the same time, from the perspective of “Proactive Contribution
to Peace” based on the principle of international cooperation, Japan
will strengthen its bilateral and multilateral cooperative relationships
in order to ensure the stability of the Asia-Pacific region, which
is closely related to its own security. Japan will also engage in
international peacekeeping and other similar activities (peacekeeping
operations by the United Nations, non-traditional security initiatives
including Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief (HA/DR),
and other internationally collaborative activities to improve the
international security environment) and other efforts more proactively
than before as efforts to address the global security challenges, in
light of the diversified roles and increased opportunities of the
defense force.
From these viewpoints, given the changes in the security
environment, the defense force based on this NDPG should prioritize
particularly important functions and capabilities through optimal
resource allocation as a whole. The defense force also must be an
effective one which enables conducting a diverse range of activities
to be seamless as well as dynamic and adapting to situations as they
demand. To that end, Japan will build a Dynamic Joint Defense
Force, which emphasizes both soft and hard aspects of readiness,
sustainability, resiliency and connectivity, reinforced by advanced
technology and capability for C3I, with a consideration to establish a
wide range of infrastructure to support the SDF’s operation.
3. Strengthening of the Japan-U.S. Alliance
The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements based on the Japan-U.S. Security
Treaty, together with Japan’s own efforts, constitute the cornerstone for
Japan’s national security. The Japan-U.S. Alliance centered on bilateral
security arrangements functions as public goods that contribute to the
stability and prosperity not only of Japan but also of the Asia-Pacific
region and the world at large.
Under its policy of strategic rebalancing towards the Asia-Pacific


region, the U.S. is maintaining and strengthening its engagement and
presence in the region while enhancing its partnerships and cooperation
with its allies, including Japan, and partner countries. As the security
environment surrounding Japan becomes increasingly severer, it has
become more important than ever for Japan’s security to strengthen the
Japan-U.S. Alliance and make it more balanced and effective.
(1) Strengthening deterrence and response capabilities of the JapanU.S. Alliance

In order to ensure Japan’s national security by maintaining and
strengthening the commitment of the U.S. towards Japan and the
Asia-Pacific region, Japan will revise the Guidelines for JapanU.S. Defense Cooperation, further enhance Japan-U.S. defense
cooperation and reinforce the deterrence provided by the Japan-U.S.
Alliance and the alliance’s contingency response capabilities, while
strengthening Japan’s own capabilities as a premise for these efforts.
At the same time, in response to the increasingly severe security
environment, while increasing the presence of Japan and the U.S.
in the western Pacific region, Japan will build seamless cooperation
with the U.S. ranging from situations on a day-to-day basis to various
situations, including cooperation in responding to “gray-zone”
situations.
To that end, Japan will continue to expand joint training and
exercises, joint ISR activities and the joint/shared use of facilities
and areas with the U.S. It will also tighten the Japan-U.S. operational
cooperation and policy coordination including contingency response
and medium-to long-term strategies, such as BMD, bilateral planning,
and Extended Deterrence Dialogue.
(2) Strengthening and expanding cooperation in a broad range of fields
The Japan-U.S. Alliance will contribute to the peace and stability
of the world, including the Asia-Pacific region, by strengthening
cooperation not only in the fields of anti-piracy efforts, capacity
building assistance, HA/DR, peacekeeping and counter terrorism but
also in maritime affairs, outer space and cyberspace.
As for disaster response, Japan will further strengthen its
cooperation between the SDF and the U.S. forces within and outside
Japan in light of the fact that the U.S. forces, including its USFJ
facilities and areas, greatly contributed to the safety of the Japanese
people during the Great East Japan Earthquake.
In addition, Japan will constantly strengthen and expand the
Japan-U.S. cooperative relationship over a broad range of fields,
including efforts for intelligence cooperation and information
security, and cooperation in the field of defense equipment and
technology, to build a firmer and effective alliance.
(3) Steady implementation of measures relating to the stationing of U.S.
Forces in Japan

Japan will provide stable support for the smooth and effective
stationing of U.S. forces in Japan through various measures, including
Host Nation Support (HNS). At the same time, efforts will be made
to steadily implement the realignment of U.S. forces in Japan and
mitigate the impact on local communities while maintaining the
deterrence provided by U.S. forces. In particular, Japan will seek
to mitigate the impact on Okinawa, located in a critically important
location in terms of national security and where the stationing of
U.S. forces significantly contributes to the deterrence of the JapanU.S. Alliance, by realignment, consolidation and reduction of USFJ
facilities and areas including through the relocation of Marine Corps
Air Station Futenma as well as the dispersion of the impact and other
measures, in light of the heavy concentration of such facilities and
areas there.
4. Active Promotion of Security Cooperation
(1) Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region
In the Asia-Pacific region, specific cooperative measures have been
taken mainly in non-traditional security fields, including disaster
relief. Multilateral frameworks such as the ASEAN Regional Forum
(ARF), the ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Meeting-Plus (ADMM
Plus) and the East Asia Summit (EAS) have been developed and
the regional integration initiative led by ASEAN has been making
progress. However, security challenges are becoming more serious
than ever in North East Asia. Japan will promote a variety of
further cooperative initiatives in a multi-layered manner to ease the
atmosphere of confrontation and the sense of curiosity toward one
another in the region.
Japan will promote close cooperation with the Republic of Korea
(ROK), which is in a position to support the U.S. presence in North
East Asia together with Japan, and will make efforts to establish a
foundation for further cooperation with the ROK, for example by
concluding an agreement on security information protection and an
acquisition and cross-servicing agreement.
Japan will further deepen its relationship with Australia, with
which Japan shares security interests and security cooperation
has been advancing, and strengthen cooperation in fields such as


-----

international peacekeeping activities. Japan will also actively conduct
joint training and other activities so as to improve interoperability
with Australia.
Moreover, efforts will be made to promote the partnerships
among U.S. allies in the Asia-Pacific region by strengthening
cooperative relationships under trilateral frameworks among Japan,
the U.S. and ROK and among Japan, the U.S. and Australia.
As Chinese activities have a significant impact on regional
security, Japan will promote security dialogue and exchanges with
China in order to enhance mutual understanding and will develop
confidence-building measures to prevent unexpected situations.
Japan will maintain a calm and firm stance in dealing with the rapid
expansion and intensification of Chinese activities on the sea and in
the air surrounding Japan.
Japan will promote security dialogues with Russia, including
the Foreign and Defense Ministerial Consultations (“2+2”), highlevel exchanges, and unit-to-unit exchanges in order to deepen
understanding about the intention of Russian military activities and
develop mutual trust with Russia. In addition, Japan will enhance
bilateral training and exercises with Russia to promote regional
stability.
Japan will also further strengthen its relationships with partner
countries in the region, including Southeast Asian countries, and will
actively promote joint training and exercises and capacity building
assistance. In addition, Japan will strengthen its cooperation with these
countries in the field of disaster management in light of the increasing
frequency and growing scale of disasters in the region. Japan will
strengthen its relationship with India in a broad range of fields,
including maritime security, through joint training and exercises as
well as joint implementation of international peacekeeping activities.
As capacity building assistance is effective in stabilizing the
security environment and strengthening bilateral defense cooperation,
Japan will promote it in full coordination with diplomatic policy
initiatives, including the Official Development Assistance, and
aligning it with joint training and exercises and international
peacekeeping activities. Japan will also strengthen cooperation with
relevant countries which actively provide such support, thereby
expanding the range of countries receiving support as well as its
scope.
Under ongoing multilateral security cooperation and dialogue in
the Asia-Pacific region, Japan in cooperation with the United States
and Australia will proactively contribute to building cooperative
relationships in the region. Moreover, Japan will actively participate
in multilateral joint training and exercises and play a major role in
enhancing confidence-building measures among countries in the
region, attaching importance to multilateral frameworks such as the
ARF and the ADMM Plus.
(2) Cooperation with the international community
It is very difficult for a single country to respond to global security
challenges on its own. Moreover, as the roles of military forces
have diversified, there are increasing opportunities for such forces
to play an important role not only in preventing and responding to
conflicts and maintaining peace but also in supporting post-conflict
reconstruction, building peace and promoting confidence-building
and friendly relationships.
Therefore, Japan will promote various initiatives to improve the
global security environment on a regular basis in cooperation with the
international community.
Japan will continue and strengthen various initiatives concerning
arms control, disarmament, nonproliferation and capacity building
assistance in order to respond to global security challenges, including
regional conflicts, expansion and spread of international terrorism,
failed states, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and
problems related to the sea, outer space and cyberspace, while
regularly cooperating with its ally and relevant countries with which
it shares security interests and with international organizations and
other relevant bodies.
In this respect, Japan will further strengthen its cooperation
with the European Union (EU), North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe
(OSCE) and with the United Kingdom, France and other European
countries and will work with them in responding to these challenges.
Japan will also promote cooperation and exchanges with regard to
equipment and technology with these countries and organizations.
In order to stabilize the security environment in the Asia-Pacific
region and improve the global security environment based on the
policy of “Proactive Contribution to Peace” based on the principle
of international cooperation, Japan will actively promote various
international peace cooperation activities, including international
peace cooperation assignments and emergency relief activities,
in a multi-layered manner. To this end, Japan will ensure close


cooperation between the defense and foreign affairs authorities, with
comprehensive consideration given to the significance of the dispatch
of SDF units, the situation of countries accepting SDF units and
Japan’s political and economic relationships with recipient countries.
With regard to international peace cooperation activities and
other similar activities in particular, Japan will continue to actively
conduct activities utilizing the SDF’s capabilities and will increase
the number of SDF personnel it dispatches to assume positions of
responsibility at organizations such as the local mission headquarters
and the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations. In
addition, Japan will conduct a study on various challenges it has to
overcome to enable the dispatch of SDF personnel in a broad range of
fields, and take necessary measures. Japan will also contribute to the
training of domestic and foreign personnel engaging in peacebuilding
by making use of the SDF’s experience and knowledge.
**IV. Future Defense Forces**
1. The Role of the Defense Force
Japan’s future defense forces will be developed as described in III. 2 (2)
above, and will be capable of effectively fulfilling the expected roles in
the following fields, and will maintain the necessary posture.
(1) Effective deterrence of and response to various situations
In order to respond to various situations in a timely and appropriate
manner, and certainly protect the lives and property of its people
and the sovereignty of its land, sea and airspace, Japan will achieve
intelligence superiority through persistent ISR activities in an
extensive surrounding area to constantly gain an understanding of
military developments in other countries and to detect any signs of
development at an early stage.

Through such activities, Japan will clearly express its resolve not
to tolerate the change of the status quo by force, thereby preventing
various situations from occurring.

At the same time, Japan will swiftly and seamlessly respond
to situations including gray zone situations, and will establish the
necessary posture to continuously address a protracted situation.

Moreover, Japan will implement an effective response tailored
to each situation, even in cases when multiple events occur in a
consecutive or concurrent manner.

When implementing the initiatives above, the following points are
emphasized in particular:
a. Ensuring security of the sea and airspace surrounding Japan
In addition to persistent ISR in an extensive area around Japan,
Japan will immediately take appropriate measures to deal with
any incursions into its territorial airspace. Japan will respond
effectively and promptly to gray-zone situations or any other acts
that may violate its sovereignty. Furthermore, should the acts
in question become protracted or escalate, Japan will respond
seamlessly as the situation evolves, taking all possible measures
for the defense and security of the sea and airspace surrounding
Japan.
b. Response to an attack on remote islands
In responding to an attack on remote islands, Japan will intercept
and defeat any invasion, by securing maritime supremacy and
air superiority, with the necessary SDF units swiftly deployed
to interdict, in addition to the units deployed in advance in
accordance with the security environment. Moreover, should any
remote islands be invaded, Japan will recapture them. In doing so,
any ballistic missile or cruise missile attacks will be dealt with
appropriately.
c. Response to ballistic missile attacks
Japan will promptly detect any signs of a ballistic missile launch
and facilitate a swift, sustained response by establishing a multilayered defense posture. Should any damage result, Japan will
take steps to minimize it. Moreover, in the event of an attack by
guerrillas or special operations forces concurrent with a ballistic
missile attack, Japan will protect key facilities including nuclear
power plants and search and destroy the infiltrating units.
d. Responses in outer space and cyberspace
In regard with outer space and cyberspace, Japan will build up
persistent ISR capabilities to prevent any acts that could impede
efficient action by the SDF. Furthermore, should any situation
arise, Japan will identify the event without delay and swiftly repair
any damage, while taking necessary steps to contain it. Moreover,
in light of society’s growing dependence on outer space and
cyberspace, Japan will make effective use of the SDF’s capabilities
when endeavoring to strengthen collaboration with relevant
organizations and clarify the division of roles, thereby contributing
to comprehensive, government-wide initiatives.
e. Responses to major disasters
Should a major disaster occur, Japan will swiftly transport and
deploy the requisite units and take all possible measures as part
of its initial response, and maintain its presence in the longer


-----

term, when required. Moreover, as well as providing a meticulous
response to the needs of disaster-stricken citizens and local
government bodies, Japan will engage in appropriate partnerships
and cooperation with local governments and the private sector,
in order to save lives, carry out emergency repairs, and provide
livelihood support.
(2) Stabilization of the Asia-Pacific and improvement of global security
environments

Through persistent ISR in the area surrounding Japan and the
timely and appropriate implementation of training, exercises, and
various other activities, Japan will ensure the stability of the security
environment in the Asia-Pacific region as a whole including the
vicinity of Japan.

Moreover, working in partnership with its ally and partners,
Japan will promote multi-tiered initiatives, including bilateral and
multilateral defense cooperation and exchange, joint training and
exercises, and capacity building assistance, effectively fulfilling its
key role in initiatives focused on the stabilization of the security
environment, including the building and strengthening of intraregional cooperative frameworks in the Asia-Pacific region.

As the roles played by military capacity diversify, in order to
respond appropriately to global security issues including regional
conflicts, the expansion and spread of international terrorism, failed
states, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, Japan will
strengthen various initiatives focused on arms control, disarmament
and non-proliferation, as well as actively promote international peace
cooperation activities, anti-piracy initiatives and capacity building
assistance, thereby working on improvement of the global security
environment.

Japan will attach importance to the following in particular, when
engaging in the aforementioned initiatives.
a. Holding training and exercises
As well as the timely and appropriate implementation of SDF
training and exercises, Japan will promote bilateral and multilateral
joint training and exercises in the Asia-Pacific region, proactively
and visibly demonstrating our nation’s resolve and advanced
capabilities focused on regional stabilization. In addition, it will
build and strengthen cooperative relationships with relevant
countries.
b. Promoting defense cooperation and exchange
Enhancing mutual understanding and relationships of trust with
other countries and international organizations is the cornerstone
of efforts to stabilize the security environment. Japan will take
further steps to promote multi-layered defense cooperation
and exchange, such as building and strengthening cooperative
relationships focused on wide-ranging security issues of common
interest including HADR and ensuring the stable use of the seas,
outer space and cyberspace.
c. Promoting capacity building assistance
Utilizing the capabilities of the SDF, Japan will continuously
engage in capacity building assistance such as human resource
development and technical support on a regular basis in order to
enhance the ability of developing countries themselves, thereby
improving the security environment with particular focus on active
creation of stability in the Asia-Pacific region.
d. Ensuring maritime security
As it is particularly vital for Japan as a maritime state to maintain
an “Open and Stable Seas” order which serves as the cornerstone
of peace and prosperity, Japan will take all possible measures to
secure the safety of maritime traffic. Japan will also conduct antipiracy activities in cooperation with countries concerned, and will
promote various efforts including capacity building assistance of
coastal states in this field and enhancement of joint training and
exercises by taking various opportunities in waters other than those
surrounding our country.
e. Implementing international peace cooperation activities
Working in partnership with non-governmental organizations
and other relevant organizations, Japan will actively engage in
international peace cooperation assignments and emergency
relief activities to meet diverse needs, from peacekeeping to
peacebuilding, placing greater emphasis on playing more of a
leading role. In doing so, as well as enhancing its readiness posture
to facilitate rapid overseas dispatch according to the situation,
Japan will strengthen its sustainable preparedness for a protracted
overseas deployment.
f. Cooperating with efforts to promote arms control, disarmament,
and nonproliferation

Japan will be actively involved in arms control and disarmament
activities undertaken by the United Nations and other bodies.
In doing so, Japan will make active, effective use of the SDF’s
knowledge, including through personnel contribution. Moreover,


the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missiles that
can serve as their means of delivery, as well as the proliferation of
arms and goods and technology which could be diverted to military
use pose severe threats to the peace and stability not only of Japan
but also of the international community as a whole. Thus, Japan will
cooperate with relevant countries and international organizations
and other relevant bodies in promoting nonproliferation initiatives.
2. Priorities in strengthening architecture of the Self Defense Forces
(1) Basic approach
The SDF will maintain an appropriate structure to effectively
fulfill the abovementioned roles of defense forces. As such, Japan
has conducted capability assessments based on joint operations in
relation to various potential contingencies to identify the functions
and capabilities that should be prioritized in order to pursue more
effective build-up of the defense force.

Based on the results of the capability assessments, in the defense
capability buildup, the SDF will prioritize the development of
capacities to ensure maritime supremacy and air superiority, which
is the prerequisite for effective deterrence and response in various
situations, including defense posture buildup in the southwestern
region. Furthermore, the SDF will emphasize the establishment of
rapid deployment capabilities with a consideration to establishing a
wide-ranging logistical support foundation.

At the same time, in terms of preparation for a Cold-War era style
invasion such as the landing of large-scale ground forces, the SDF
will possess the minimum necessary level of expertise and skills
required to respond to unforeseen changes in the situation in the
future and to maintain and inherit them, and thereby further promote
efforts to achieve even greater efficiency and rationalization.
(2) Functions and capabilities to be emphasized
From the perspective of efficiently developing an effective defense
force, the SDF will selectively strengthen the following functions and
capabilities in particular, paying attention to enhance joint functions
with interoperability with the U.S. forces.
a. ISR capabilities
In order to ensure effective deterrence and response to various
situations, while utilizing unmanned equipment, Japan will
implement extensive persistent ISR on objectives such as aircraft
and vessels in the seas and airspace surrounding it, and the SDF
will adopt a flexible approach to boosting its ISR posture according
to the developments of situations.
b. Intelligence capabilities
Japan will strengthen its system for intelligence collection,
processing information, and analyzing and sharing the collected
information, so that the SDF can promptly detect and swiftly
respond to signs of various situations and take necessary measures
based on medium-to long-term military trends mainly in its
vicinity.

In doing so, the SDF will seek to augment its various
information collection capabilities, including HUMINT, OSINT,
SIGINT, and IMINT, as well as persistent ISR capabilities using
unmanned aerial vehicles. Also, the SDF will engage in integrated
efforts to strengthen its geospatial intelligence capabilities to
combine various types of intelligence on images and maps to
exploit them in a sophisticated manner, while establishing a
framework for the integrated and systematic nurturing of highly
capable personnel in information gathering analysis.
c. Transport capability
In order to secure swift and large-scale transport and deployment
capability, and to swiftly deploy and move necessary units, the
SDF will strengthen integrated transport capacity including
maritime and airborne transport capacity, with collaboration
with the civilian transport sector. In doing so, the SDF will avoid
redundancy in functions by clarifying roles and assignments
among various means of transport, considering their respective
characteristics.
d. Command and control, and information and communications
capabilities

In order to establish a command and control system that can
manage units nationwide in a mobile, joint integrated manner,
the SDF will take steps to deploy the Ground Self-Defense Force
(GSDF), Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) and Air SelfDefense Force (ASDF) personnel in the main headquarters of each
service, making effective use of the knowledge and experience
held by each respective service. Furthermore, the SDF will
facilitate swift, resilient nationwide operation of the GSDF’s units
such as basic operational units (divisions and brigades) through
the establishment of a new central headquarters to control all of
the regional armies, as well as greater efficiency and streamlining
of the command and control function in each regional army
headquarters, and other measures.


-----

Moreover, the SDF will strive to enhance and strengthen
its information and communications capabilities that are
prerequisites for supporting nationwide operation, starting with
the communications infrastructure on remote islands and data link
functions among the three services.
e. Response to an attack on remote islands
In order to ensure maritime supremacy and air superiority which is
a prerequisite for effective response to an attack on remote islands,
the SDF will strengthen its ability to deal with attacks by aircraft,
naval vessels, and missiles, etc.

Moreover, while strengthening the integrated capabilities
to seek to interdict any attack on Japan’s remote islands at sea,
the SDF will newly develop sufficient amphibious operations
capability, which enables the SDF to land, recapture and secure
without delay in the case of an invasion of any remote islands.

Furthermore, the SDF will enhance its logistical support
capabilities, so that SDF units can swiftly and continuously
respond in the event of a situation in the southwestern region.

In addition, the SDF will also examine the desirable air
defense posture in remote islands in the Pacific.
f. Response to ballistic missile attacks
To counter North Korea’s improved ballistic missile capability,
Japan will pursue comprehensive improvement of its response
capability against the threat of ballistic missiles.

With regard to the BMD system, Japan will enhance
readiness, simultaneous engagement capability and sustainable
response capability to strengthen the capability to protect the entire
territory.

Based on appropriate role and mission sharing between Japan
and the U.S., in order to strengthen the deterrent of the JapanU.S. Alliance as a whole through enhancement of Japan’s own
deterrent and response capability, Japan will study a potential form
of response capability to address the means of ballistic missile
launches and related facilities, and take means as necessary.
g. Responses in outer space and cyberspace
While strengthening information collection capability using
satellites equipped with a variety of sensors, and reinforcing
command, control and telecommunications capabilities, the SDF
will secure effective, stable use of outer space so that satellites can
continuously exercise their capabilities even in contingencies by
enhancing the survivability of satellites through such initiatives as
space situational awareness. In implementing such initiatives, the
SDF will form organic partnerships with research and development
institutions in Japan, as well as with the U.S.

As for cyberspace, Japan will enhance integrated persistent
surveillance and response capabilities and expertise and latest
equipment will be continuously developed and secured in order to
prevent actions that hinder efficient SDF activities.
h. Responses to major disasters, etc.
In the event of a large-scale natural disaster such as a Nankai
Trough earthquake, or an atypical disaster such as a nuclear
emergency, it is of vital importance to respond swiftly from the
initial stages of the impact and carry out such tasks as information
gathering on the extent and nature of the damage from the air by
aircrafts, rescue operations and emergency repairs. In this regard,
the SDF will develop a response posture sustainable for longterm operation, through swift transportation and deployment of
appropriately size units, and by establishing a rotating staffing
posture based on a joint operational approach.
i. Responses focused on international peace cooperation activities
and other similar activities

In international peace cooperation activities and other similar
activities, the SDF will strengthen the necessary protective
capabilities to carry out its operations, ensuring the safety of
personnel and units. Moreover, the SDF will work on enhancing
transport and deployment capability, information communication
capability with a view to long term activities in Africa and other
remote locations, and strengthening logistic and medical service
structure for smooth and continuous operation.

From the standpoint of carrying out international peace
cooperation activities more effectively, Japan will consider
measures for making more effective use of the SDF Operational
Facility for Deployed Air Force for Anti-Piracy Operation in
Djibouti.

Furthermore, while strengthening intelligence gathering
capability required for operations, the SDF will enhance its
education, training and personnel management systems in order
to facilitate the continuous dispatch of adequate personnel for
overseas cooperation activities.
3. Architecture of each service of the Self-Defense Forces
The organization, equipment and disposition in each service of the SDF


are outlined in (1) to (3) below. The specifics of major organizations and
equipment in the future are as shown in the Annex table.
(1) Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF)
a. In order to be able to respond swiftly and deal effectively and
nimbly with an attack on offshore islands and various other
situations, the GSDF will maintain rapidly deployable basic
operational units (rapid deployment divisions, rapid deployment
brigades and an armored division) furnished with advanced
mobility and ISR capabilities. In addition, the GSDF will maintain
mobile operating units sustaining specialized functions in order
to effectively perform such operations as airborne operations,
amphibious operations, special operations, air transportation,
defense against NBC (nuclear, biological, and chemical) weapons,
and international peace cooperation activities.

Keeping in mind that the role of these highly-proficient
rapidly deployable basic operational units is to swiftly deploy and
move via the integrated transport capacity referred to in 2 (2) c.
above, the GSDF will maintain half of these in Hokkaido, given
the excellent training environment there.

The defense posture in the remote islands of the southwestern
region will be enhanced and strengthened via the permanent
stationing of the units where the SDF is not currently stationed, the
deploy ability of the aforementioned units, and the establishment
of organic partnerships and networks with the MSDF and ASDF.
b. The GSDF will maintain surface-to-ship guided missile units in
order to prevent invasion of Japan’s remote islands while still at
sea, as far as possible.
c. The GSDF will maintain surface-to-air guided missile units in
order to effectively provide air defense to protect operational units
and key areas, working in tandem with the surface-to-air guided

d. The GSDF will review the organization and equipment of the basic
operational units (divisions and brigades) other than the rapidly
deployable ones referred to in a. above, with a particular focus on
tanks/howitzers and rockets. Following thorough rationalization
and streamlining, these units will be deployed appropriately,
according to geographical characteristics.
(2) Maritime Self Defense Force (MSDF)
a. The MSDF will maintain destroyer units and ship-based patrol
helicopter units strengthened by increased numbers of equipment,
including the new destroyers, with additional multifunctional
capability and with a compact-type hull, in order to effectively
conduct persistent ISR and antisubmarine operations etc., thereby
facilitating agile response in such areas as the defense of the
seas surrounding Japan, the security of maritime traffic, and
international peace cooperation activities etc.

Along with the surface-to-air guided missile units referred to
in (3) d. below, the destroyer units will maintain Aegis-equipped
destroyers capable of providing Japan with multi-layered defense
against ballistic missile attacks.
b. The MSDF will maintain submarine units strengthened by
increased numbers of them, in order to effectively conduct patrol
and defense of the seas surrounding Japan, as well as regularly
engage in broad underwater intelligence gathering and warning
and surveillance in those seas.
c. The MSDF will maintain fixed-wing patrol aircraft units in order
to effectively conduct patrol and defense of the seas surrounding
Japan, as well as regularly engage in broad maritime intelligence
gathering and warning and surveillance in those seas.
d. The MSDF will maintain minesweeper units in order to effectively
conduct minesweeping operations in the seas surrounding
Japan in collaboration with the new destroyers with additional
multifunctional capability and with the compact-type hull referred
to in a. above.
(3) Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF)

most air space over Japan and the surrounding areas. Air warning
units will be enhanced in order to conduct effective warning,
surveillance and control in the air over long periods in the event of
“gray zone” situations.
b. The ASDF will maintain fighter aircraft units reinforced by highly
capable fighter aircrafts in order to provide aerial defense for Japan
based on a comprehensive posture that brings together fighter
aircrafts and relevant support functions. In addition, the ASDF will
maintain enhanced aerial refueling and transport units that will
enable fighter aircraft units and air warning units, etc. to carry out
various operations sustainably in the air space surrounding Japan.


-----

c. The ASDF will maintain air transport units in order to effectively
carry out the mobile deployment of ground-based units etc., and
international peace cooperation activities etc.
d. The ASDF will maintain surface-to-air guided missile units
providing multi-layered defense for Japan against ballistic missile
attacks, together with the Aegis destroyers referred to in (2) a.
above, as well as protecting key areas in tandem with the surfaceto-air guided missile units referred to in (1) c. above.
**V. Basic Foundations for SDF**
To ensure that the diverse activities required of the SDF are carried out in
a timely and appropriate manner, it is not sufficient simply to upgrade the
main elements of the organization and its equipment; it is also imperative to
strengthen the various foundations underpinning the defense force, in order to
ensure that it can function as effectively as possible. The key aspects of this
are as follows.
1. Training and Exercises
Through routine training and exercises, the SDF will ceaselessly review
and examine various plans for dealing with situations, as well as strive to
enhance and strengthen its training and exercises in order to improve the
tactical skills in each of its branches. In doing so, as well as making more
effective use of the excellent training environment in Hokkaido, the SDF
will work in partnership with relevant organizations and the civilian sector,
in order to ensure systematic implementation of more practical training
and exercises.

 In the southwestern region, where there are limitations on the
exercise areas, etc. of the SDF, the SDF will secure a favorable training
environment through the joint use of U.S. military facilities and areas,
while remaining sensitive to relationships with the local community, so
that timely and appropriate training and exercises can be carried out,
including Japan-U.S. bilateral training and exercises.
2. Operational Infrastructure
The SDF will improve survivability, including the recovery capabilities of
military camps and bases, etc., in order to maintain the support functions
that serve as the operational infrastructure for units, so that units can be
deployed swiftly and respond to various situations effectively.

 Moreover, in light of the fact that some SDF facilities are currently
dilapidated, the SDF will implement a steady repair and maintenance
program, as well as expansion of the necessary quarters in order to ensure
an emergency call-up of personnel in the event of various situations,
thereby enhancing readiness.

 The SDF will undertake necessary deliberations concerning civilian
airports and ports, including approaches to the various systems on a dayto-day basis, in order to ensure that such facilities can be used as part of the
operational infrastructure for the SDF, etc. from an early stage, depending
on the situation. Furthermore, it will implement various family support
measures, in order to alleviate the anxieties both of troops serving away
from home and of their families while they are away.

 The SDF will enhance and strengthen the operational infrastructure
in terms of equipment and materials, such as improving the operational
availability of equipment, by taking all possible measures to maintain and
upgrade SDF equipment, as well as securing and stockpiling the necessary
ammunition.
3. Personnel and Education
Given that equipment has become more advanced and complex, and
missions more diverse and internationalized in recent years, the SDF
will implement measures to reform the personnel management system,
in order to ensure the edge of its troops and the effective use of human
resources amid a severe fiscal situation, taking into consideration a
variety of elements, including skills, experience, physical strength and
morale.

 Accordingly, the SDF will implement measures to ensure an
appropriate composition of ranks and age distribution, taking into
account the various missions and characteristics of each branch of the
SDF.

 The SDF will implement measures to make effective use of
human resources, such as more effective use of female SDF personnel
and expansion of reappointment, and measures related to honors and
privileges. In order to strengthen the joint operations structure, the SDF
will enhance education and training, and, through secondments to the
Joint Staff and relevant ministries and agencies, retain adequate personnel
who have a broad outlook and ideas, as well as wide-ranging experience
in Japan’s security-affairs, and who can respond flexibly and rapidly to
various situations as part of the government.

 In light of the deterioration of the recruiting environment resulting
from social factors such as the declining birthrate and popularization of
higher education, the SDF will promote a diverse range of recruitment
measures to spread the perception that the SDF is an attractive job option.

 Furthermore, as it is the responsibility of the Government of Japan to
secure the livelihoods of the SDF personnel, who are compelled to resign
at a younger age than ordinary civil servants, the SDF will promote support
for re-employment by strengthening collaboration with local governments


and relevant organizations.

 In order to support sustainable operation of units in situations that are
becoming increasingly diversified and protracted, the SDF will promote
utilization of reserve personnel in broad areas, including those with
professional skills such as aviators, and will take measures to improve the
sufficiency of reserve personnel.
4. Medical
In order to keep SDF personnel in good health and enhance their ability
to engage in a diverse range of missions, such as various situation
responses and international peace cooperation activities, the SDF will
establish an efficient and high-quality medical care structure, through
endeavors including upgrading of SDF hospitals into hubs with enhanced
functions, and improvements in the management of the National Defense
Medical College Hospital. The SDF will also attach greater importance to
securing and training of such medical staff as medical officers, nurses and
emergency medical technicians.

 The SDF will consider such matters as revisions of regulations of
emergency medical treatment on situation responses, and improve first
aid capabilities on the frontline, and will put in place a posture for rapid
medical evacuation that takes into account the viewpoints of enhanced
joint capabilities.
5. Defense Production and Technological Bases
Retaining an adequate level of defense production and technological bases
is essential not only for the production, operation, maintenance and upkeep
of equipment, but also for research and development of equipment that fits
the operational environment, and for the expected potential to contribute
to enhancing deterrence.

 At the same time, against the backdrop of the severe fiscal
situation and rises in the equipment unit price as it becomes increasingly
sophisticated and complex, the numbers of units of procured equipment
are on the decline. Moreover, the environment surrounding Japan’s defense
production and technological bases is becoming more severe. For instance,
the competitiveness of foreign companies is growing, as a result of the
advance of large-scale and cross-border restructuring and consolidation of
the defense industry.

 In this kind of environment, the Ministry of Defense will formulate
a strategy that sets forth its future vision for Japan’s defense production
and technological bases as a whole and will promote participation in
international joint development and production and adapting defense
equipment to civilian use, in order to maintain and reinforce such bases
without delay.

 With regard to contribution to peace and international cooperation,
there are increasing opportunities to cooperate in a more effective
manner through, for example, the utilization and provision to disasterstricken countries and others of heavy machinery and other defense
equipment carried to sites by the SDF. Moreover, internationally, it has
become the mainstream to participate in international joint development
and production projects in order to improve the performance of defense
equipment while dealing with the rising costs of the equipment. In this
context, from the perspective of “Proactive Contribution to Peace” based
on the principle of international cooperation, Japan is required to engage
more proactively in peacebuilding efforts and international cooperation by
utilizing defense equipment in various ways, and to participate in joint
development and production of defense equipment and other related items.

 Against this backdrop, while giving due consideration to the roles that
the Three Principles on Arms Exports and their related policy guidelines
have played so far, the Government of Japan will set out clear principles
on the overseas transfer of arms and military technology, which fit the
new security environment. In this context, considerations will be made
with regard to defining cases where transfers are prohibited; limiting cases
where transfers could be allowed with strict examination; and ensuring
appropriate control over transfers in terms of unauthorized use and third
party transfer.
6. Efficient Acquisition of Equipment
In order to achieve effective and efficient acquisition of equipment,
including in research and development activities, the Ministry of Defense
will strengthen project management throughout the life-cycle of equipment
through introducing a project manager system, as well as through
considering the possibility of further introducing long-term contracts and
further upgrading the contract system to provide cost reduction incentives
to companies, aiming to improve cost-effectiveness throughout the lifecycle of equipment.

 Moreover, the Ministry of Defense will try to improve readiness
and response capabilities through reforms of the logistics posture through
effective use of capacity in the private sector. Furthermore, it will
ceaselessly pursue greater transparency in the acquisition process and
increased rationalization of the contract system, and strive to achieve more
rigorous procedures for the acquisition of equipment.
7. Research and Development
The Ministry of Defense will ensure consistency with the priorities
for upgrading defense capability when commencing research and


-----

development, in order to guarantee that research and development that
meets the operational needs of the SDF is prioritized in view of the severe
fiscal situation.

 In conjunction with this, the Ministry of Defense will promote
research and development based on a medium- to long-term perspective,
taking into account the latest trends in science and technology, changes
in combat modality, cost-effectiveness and the potential for international
joint research and development, with a view to implementing research and
development that can ensure Japan’s technological superiority against new
threats in strategically important areas.

 From the aspect of security, it is necessary to utilize civilian technology
effectively also in the field of security through regularly assessing the trend
in science and technology including information related to technological
development as well as consolidating the capabilities of the government,
industry and academia. Under such recognition, the Ministry of Defense
will strive to make effective use of civilian technology that can also be
applied to defense (dual-use technologies), by enhancing partnerships
with universities and research institutes, while strengthening technology
control functions to prevent the outflow of advanced technologies.

 The Ministry of Defense will examine its research and development
initiative for achieving the aforementioned objectives.
8. Collaboration with Local Communities
The Ministry of Defense and the SDF will further strengthen collaboration
with relevant organizations, including local governments, the police and
the fire service, in order to enable the SDF to provide accurate response
to various situations. Such close partnerships with local governments, etc.
are exceedingly important from the perspective not only of the effective
improvement and smooth operation of defense facilities, but also of the
recruitment of SDF personnel, as well as the provision of re-employment
support for them.

 Accordingly, as well as continuing to advance measures targeting
the areas around defense facilities, with a view to their improvement
and operation, the Ministry of Defense and SDF will routinely engage
in various measures such as intensive public relations activities focused
on their policies and activities, in order to secure the understanding and
cooperation of local governments and communities.

 Given that the presence of SDF units makes a substantial contribution
to the maintenance and revitalization of local communities in some areas,
and supports community medicine through emergency patient transport
using SDF search and rescue aircraft in others, the Ministry of Defense
and the SDF will give consideration to the attributes of each area in the
reorganization of units and deployment of military camps and bases, etc.,
in order to secure the understanding of local governments and residents. At
the same time, in operating the military camps and bases, etc., the Ministry
of Defense will pay attention to the contribution of the operation to the
local economy.
9. Boosting Communication Capabilities
The Ministry of Defense and SDF will strengthen strategic public
relations and communication to enhance the dissemination of information
via a diverse range of media, in order to secure domestic and overseas
understanding which is vital to effectively conduct SDF duties.
10. Enhancing the Intellectual Base
The Ministry of Defense will promote education on security-related
matters at educational institutions, in order to enhance understanding of
security and crisis management among the populace. Moreover, in addition
to strengthening the Ministry of Defense and SDF research systems, with a
particular focus on the National Institute for Defense Studies, the Ministry
of Defense will promote various partnerships, including education and
research exchange with other research and educational institutions within
the government, as well as universities and think-tanks both within Japan
and overseas.
11. Promoting Reform of the Ministry of Defense
The Ministry of Defense will further promote reforms by constantly
reviewing its work methods and organization in order to foster a sense of
unity among civilian officials and uniformed personnel, total optimization
in building up defense capability, strengthening SDF’s joint operation
functions and enhancing policy-making and communication functions.
**VI. Additional Points**
1. These Guidelines set out the form of Japan’s defense force over the
next decade or so. The National Security Council will conduct regular,
systematic review over the course of implementation of the various
measures and programs. Smooth, swift and accurate transition to the
future defense force will be facilitated through validations based on joint
operational capability assessment while advancing such initiatives in a
timely and appropriate manner.
2. When major changes in the situation are anticipated during the review and
verification process, necessary examination of the security environment at
that time will be taken into account and these guidelines will be revised
adequately.
3. In light of the increasingly tough fiscal conditions, Japan will strive to
achieve greater efficiency and streamlining in the defense capability


buildup to curb costs, and harmonize with other initiatives in other fields
to ensure that Japan’s defense force as a whole can smoothly fulfill its
expected function.

Reference 7 Medium Term Defense Program (FY2014-FY2018)

(Approved by the National Security Council
and the Cabinet on December 17, 2013)
The Five-Year Defense Program (FY2014-FY2018) in accordance with the
National Defense Program Guidelines for FY2014 and beyond (approved by
the National Security Council and the Cabinet on December 17, 2013) has
been established as shown in the attached document.
(Attachment)
Medium Term Defense Program (FY2014-FY2018)
**I. Program Guidelines**
In carrying out the Defense Program for FY2014 to FY2018 in accordance
with the National Defense Program Guidelines for FY2014 and beyond
(approved by the National Security Council and the Cabinet on December
17, 2013) (hereinafter “NDPG2013”), Japan will develop a Dynamic Joint
Defense Force. It will provide an effective defense which enables the SDF
to conduct a diverse range of activities based on joint operations seamlessly
and dynamically, adapting to situations as they demand, while prioritizing
particularly important functions and capabilities through optimal resource
allocation. At the same time, the Dynamic Joint Defense Force will serve
as a defense force which emphasizes soft and hard readiness capabilities,
sustainability, resiliency and connectivity, reinforced by advanced technology
and Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C3I) capabilities,
with a consideration to establish a wide range of infrastructure to support
operations by the Self-Defense Forces (SDF). In strengthening the SDF
structure, a highly effective joint defense force will be efficiently developed by
comprehensively prioritizing particularly important functions and capabilities
identified through joint operation-based capability assessments of the SDF’s
overall functions and capabilities against various scenarios.
Given the considerations mentioned above, the SDF will effectively and
efficiently build, maintain and operate defense forces based on the following
program guidelines:
1. The defense forces will seamlessly and dynamically fulfill its
responsibilities including providing an effective deterrence and response to
a variety of security situations, supporting stability in the Asia-Pacific, and
improving the global security environment. With a focus on enhancement
of joint operability, the SDF will place particular emphasis on Intelligence,
Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), intelligence, transport, and C3I
capabilities. In addition, defense forces will enhance their capabilities
to respond to an attack on remote islands, ballistic missile attacks, outer
space and cyberspace threats, large-scale disasters, and international peace
cooperation efforts (activities cooperatively carried out by the international
society to improve the international security environment such as U.N.
Peace Keeping Operations, Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief (HA/
DR), and others in the fields of non-traditional security). The SDF will
steadily develop the foundations for maximizing the effectiveness of these
functions and capabilities.
2. In relevant efforts, the SDF will prioritize the development of capacities to
ensure maritime supremacy and air superiority, which is the prerequisite
for effective deterrence and response to various situations, including
defense posture buildup in Japan’s southwestern region. Furthermore, the
SDF will emphasize the establishment of rapid deployment capabilities.

 At the same time, regarding preparation for a Cold-War era style
invasion such as the landing of large-scale ground forces, the SDF will
establish the minimum necessary level of expertise and skill required to
respond to unforeseen changes in its security situation in the future and to
maintain them, and thereby further promote efforts to achieve even greater
efficiency and rationalization of its activities.
3. Regarding equipment acquisition and maintenance, by properly
combining the introduction of new, high-performance equipment, with
life extension and improvement of existing equipment etc., the SDF
will efficiently secure defense capabilities adequate both in quantity and
quality. In this effort, the Ministry of Defense (MOD) will strengthen its
project management throughout its equipment life-cycle, including during
its research and development activities, and reduce the life-cycle costs to
improve cost-effectiveness.
4. Given the more advanced and complex equipment, and more diverse and
internationalized missions in recent years, to ensure SDF’s strength and
the effective use of defense force personnel, the SDF will implement
measures, including the more effective use of female SDF personnel and
reserve personnel, in order to reform its personnel management system.
5. In order to address an increasingly severe security environment and to
strengthen deterrence and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S. Alliance,
in conjunction with the U.S. policy of strategic rebalancing towards the
Asia-Pacific region, Japan will further promote a variety of cooperation
and consultations with the United States in a wide range of areas including
th i i f th G id li f J U S D f C ti J


-----

will also actively facilitate measures for furthering smooth and effective
stationing of U.S. forces in Japan.
6. Considering the increasingly difficult situation in Japan’s public finance,
Japan will strive to achieve greater efficiencies and streamline the buildup
of its defense forces, while harmonizing these efforts with other measures
taken by the Government.
**II. Reorganization of the Major SDF Units**
1. Regarding the reorganization of the Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF),
given the changes in the security environment surrounding Japan, for
the purpose of carrying out swift and flexible nation-wide operations of
basic operational units (rapid deployment divisions/brigades, an armored
division, and divisions/brigades) and various units under the joint
operations, the GSDF will establish the Ground Central Command. In
addition, the GSDF promote efficiency and rationalize the command and
control function of each regional army headquarters, as well as review
other functions of some regional army headquarters. As part of such
efforts, the Central Readiness Force will be disbanded and its subsidiary
units will be integrated into the Ground Central Command.

 In order to be able to respond swiftly to and deal effectively and
nimbly with an attack on remote islands and various other situations,
the GSDF will transform two divisions and two brigades respectively
into two rapid deployment divisions and two rapid deployment brigades
that are furnished with advanced mobility and ISR capabilities. By
establishing a coast observation unit, area security units in charge of
initial response activities and so on, the defense posture of the remote
islands in the southwest region will be strengthened. In a bid to develop
sufficient amphibious operational capabilities, which enable the SDF to
land, recapture and secure without delay any remote islands that might
be invaded, an amphibious rapid deployment brigade consisting of
several regiment-scale units specializing in amphibious operations will be
established.

 From the perspective of enabling swift and flexible operations,
while thoroughly facilitating efficiency and rationalizing preparations
for invasion, such as the landing of large-scale ground forces, the GSDF
will steadily implement programs towards successive formation of units
equipped with newly-introduced mobile combat vehicles and removal of
tanks deployed in basic operational units stationed in locations other than
Hokkaido and Kyushu. It will also concentrate tanks located in Kyushu into
newly organized tank units under direct command of the Western Army.
In addition, the GSDF will steadily carry out programs that concentrate
howitzers deployed in basic operational units stationed in locations other
than Hokkaido into field artillery units to be newly organized under the
direct command of the respective regional armies.
2. For the purpose of defending the seas surrounding Japan and ensuring the
security of maritime traffic in the region, through the effective conduct of
various operations such as persistent ISR operations and anti-submarine
operations, as well as for agile response in international peace cooperation
activities, the Marine Self-Defense Force (MSDF) will retain four flotillas
mainly consisting of one helicopter destroyer (DDH), and two Aegisequipped destroyers (DDG). Five divisions will consist of other destroyers
as well. Necessary measures to increase the number of submarines will
also be continued.
3. To enhance the air defense posture in the southwestern region, the Air
Self-Defense Force (ASDF) will relocate one fighter squadron to Naha Air
Base, and newly organize and deploy one airborne early warning squadron
at Naha Air Base.

 To prevent the relative decline of Japan’s air defense capabilities
and ensure sustained air superiority, ASDF units equipped with training
support functions will be integrated for further effective enhancement of
advanced tactical skills.
4. The total number of authorized GSDF personnel at the end of FY2018
will be approximately 159,000, with approximately 151,000 being activeduty personnel, and approximately 8,000 being reserve-ready personnel.
The authorized number of active-duty personnel of the MSDF and ASDF
through FY2018 will be approximately at the same levels as at the end of
FY2013.
**III. Major Programs regarding SDF’s Capabilities**
1. Effective Deterrence and Response to Various Situations
(1) Ensuring Security of the Sea and Airspace Surrounding Japan
In order to strengthen the posture to conduct persistent ISR in broad
areas and to detect any signs of significant development at an early
stage, the SDF will procure additional Aegis-equipped destroyers
(DDG), destroyer (DD), submarines, fixed-wing patrol aircraft (P-1)
and patrol helicopters (SH-60K), and conduct service-extension work
on existing destroyers, submarines, fixed-wing patrol aircraft (P-3C)
and patrol helicopters (SH-60J), as well as take necessary measures after
fully reviewing the value of ship-based unmanned aerial vehicles with
patrol capabilities. With a view to increasing the number of destroyers,
the SDF will also introduce new, compact-type hull destroyers with
additional multifunctional capabilities. The SDF will procure new
airborne early warning and control aircraft or airborne early warning


aircraft, and fixed air defense radar, as well as continuously improve its
existing airborne warning and control systems (AWACS) (E-767). In
addition, the introduction of unmanned aerial vehicles will support the
establishment of a joint unit with persistent ISR capabilities in broad
areas. The SDF will also undertake organizational reform that integrate
ground-based aerial search and rescue functions into the ASDF, which
are currently performed by both the MSDF and ASDF.
(2) Response to an Attack on Remote Islands
(a) Development of a Persistent ISR Structure
With a view to organizing the structure required to carry out
regular and persistent ISR activities which enable an immediate
response in the case of various contingencies, the SDF will
deploy a coast observation unit to Yonaguni Island. Considering
the current operational situation of the existing AWACS (E-767)
and airborne early warning aircraft (E-2C), the SDF will procure
new airborne early warning and control aircraft or airborne early
warning aircraft as stated in (1), and establish one squadron
consisting of airborne early warning aircraft (E-2C) in the air
warning unit and deploy it at Naha Air Base as stated in Section
II-3. By preparing a deployment structure for mobile air defense
radar on remote islands in the southwestern region, a fullyprepared surveillance posture will be maintained.
(b) Obtaining and Securing Air Superiority
For overall improvement of air defense capabilities including
cruise missile defense capability, the SDF will increase the
number of fighter aircraft units at Naha Air Base from one
squadron to two as stated in Section II-3, continue to facilitate
procurement of fighter aircraft (F-35A), modernize its fighter
aircraft (F-15), and improve the air-to-air combat capabilities and
network functions of its fighter aircraft (F-2). In addition, after
considering its options, it will take necessary measures to replace
fighter aircraft (F-15) unsuitable for modernization with more
capable fighter aircraft. Along with continuing to procure middlerange surface-to-air guided missiles, the SDF will further improve
its surface-to-air guided missile PATRIOT systems by equipping
them with new advanced interceptor missiles (PAC-3 MSE) that
can be used both for response to cruise missiles and aircraft and
for ballistic missile defense (BMD). The SDF will also procure
new aerial refueling/transport aircraft, and continuously work to
equip transport aircraft (C-130H) with aerial refueling capabilities
and procure rescue helicopters (UH-60J). In addition, the SDF
will examine what is the appropriate air defense posture in remote
islands in the Pacific.
(c) Obtaining and Securing Maritime Supremacy
In defense of the seas surrounding Japan and to ensure the
security of maritime traffic, the SDF will effectively conduct
various activities including holding persistent ISR and antisubmarine operations; procuring Aegis-equipped destroyers
(DDG), destroyer (DD), submarines, fixed-wing patrol aircraft
(P-1) and patrol helicopters (SH-60K); and conducting serviceextension activities on existing destroyers, submarines, fixedwing patrol aircraft (P-3C) and patrol helicopters (SH-60J) as
stated in (1). At the same time, it will introduce new compact-type
hull destroyers with multifunctional capabilities. In addition, the
SDF will introduce ship-based multipurpose helicopters required
for enabling destroyer units to sustainably conduct activities as
situations demand, and continue to procure Mine Sweeper Ocean
(MSO) vessels, amphibious rescue aircraft (US-2), and surfaceto-ship guided missiles.
(d) Improvement of Capabilities for Rapid Deployment and Response
In order to secure capabilities for swift and large-scale
transportation and deployment operations and improve effective
response capabilities, transport aircraft (C-2) and transport
helicopters (CH-47JA) will continue to be procured. Besides the
ship-based multipurpose helicopters mentioned in (c), the SDF
will introduce tilt-rotor aircraft that complement and strengthen
the capabilities of transport helicopters (CH-47JA) in terms of
cruising speed and range. In addition, the SDF will take necessary
measures after considering the possibility of new multipurpose
helicopters that will success the existing multipurpose helicopters
(UH-1J). In developing such aerial transport capabilities, the
SDF will avoid functional redundancy by clarifying the roles and
assignments among the various means of transportation.
The SDF will reinforce transportation and deployment
capabilities, by such means as acquiring amphibious vehicles
that support units’ amphibious landing efforts on remote islands,
and refitting existing Tank Landing Ships (LST). The SDF will
consider what the role should be of a multipurpose vessel with
capabilities for command and control, large-scale transportation,
and aircraft operations, which can be utilized in various operations
such as amphibious operations, and reach a conclusion regarding


-----

its acquisition. With a view to efficiently conducting largescale transportation movements in coordination with the SDF’s
transport capabilities, the SDF will take necessary measures after
considering active utilization of civilian transport capabilities
including methods for utilizing the funds and know-how of the
private sector and reserve personnel.
Mobile combat vehicles transportable by airlift will be
introduced in the rapidly deployable basic operational units (rapid
deployment divisions/brigades) highlighted in Section II-1, and
rapid deployment regiments that immediately respond to various
situations will be organized. The SDF will also establish area
security units in charge of initial responses on remote islands in
the southwestern region, as well as conduct maneuver deployment
training for prompt unit deployment to remote islands. While
improving guidance capability of existing precision-guided
bombs and procuring surface-to-ship guided missiles, the SDF
will also promote the development of improved capabilities of
ship-to-ship guided missiles, such as increasing their firing range.
(e) Development of C3I
From the perspective of improving joint force capabilities, aimed
at establishing a command and control system which enables
the dynamic operation of units across the country so as to
immediately concentrate necessary units into the area to be dealt
with, such as remote islands, the SDF will take steps to station
GSDF, MSDF and ASDF personnel in the main headquarters of
each of the other services, making effective use of the knowledge
and experience held by each respective service. In addition, as
stated in Section II-1, the SDF will expedite the establishment of
the Ground Central Command, while promoting efficiency and
rationalizing the command and control functions of each regional
army headquarters, as well as reviewing the functions of some
regional army headquarters.
With regard to the information and communications
capabilities which serve as a foundation for nation-wide
operations, and the goal of strengthening the communications
infrastructure on remote islands, the SDF will extend the
secured exclusive communication link for the SDF to Yonaguni
Island, and newly deploy mobile multiplex communication
equipment at Naha Air Base. The SDF will strive to enhance
data link functions among the three services, upgrade the field
communications systems, continue to promote the utilization of
outer space for defense-related purposes, and develop an X-Band
communications satellite with high performance. The SDF will
take additional necessary measures after considering the necessity
of further enhancements to its communications systems.
(3) Response to Ballistic Missile Attacks
Given North Korea’s improved ballistic missile capabilities, the SDF
will pursue the comprehensive improvement of its response capabilities
against the threat of ballistic missiles.
For reinforcing its multi-layered and sustainable defense posture
for the entire territory of Japan against ballistic missile attacks, the
SDF will procure additional Aegis-equipped destroyers (DDG), and
continue to improve the capabilities of its existing DDGs. As stated in
(2)(b), the SDF will pursue further improvement of its surface-to-air
guided missile PATRIOT system so as to equip it with new advanced
interceptor missiles (PAC-3 MSE) that can be used both for response
to cruise missiles and aircraft and for BMD. In addition, to reinforce
its ballistic missile detecting and tracking capabilities, the SDF will
promote the improvement of its automated warning and control
systems (Japan Aerospace Defense Ground Environment), as well as
procurement and improvement of its fixed air defense radar (FPS-7)
systems.
Along with the continuous promotion of Japan-U.S. cooperative
development of advanced interceptor missiles for BMD (SM-3
Block IIA), the MOD will, after examining options, take necessary
measures for the transition to the production and deployment phases.
The SDF will conduct bilateral training and exercises to enhance the
effectiveness of the Japan-U.S. bilateral BMD response posture, and
make an effort to establish the basis for deployment of the SDF to
respond to a ballistic missile attack.
The MOD will conduct studies on the best mix of the overall
posture of its future BMD system, including the new BMD equipment.
Also, based on appropriate role-sharing between Japan and the U.S.,
with a view to strengthening the deterrence capacity of Japan-U.S.
Alliance as a whole by enhancing Japan’s own deterrence and response
capabilities, the MOD will study its possible response capability to
address the means of ballistic missile launches and related facilities,
and will take necessary measures.
In preparation for an attack by guerrilla or special operations
forces concurrent with a ballistic missile attack, the SDF will continue
to procure a variety of surveillance equipment, light armored vehicles,


NBC reconnaissance vehicles, and transport helicopters (CH-47JA) in
order to improve its ISR posture, and its ability to protect key facilities
such as nuclear power plants, and search and destroy infiltrating units.
In sensitive locations such as where a number of nuclear power plants
are located, the SDF will conduct training with relevant agencies to
confirm coordination procedures, and take necessary measures after
considering the basis for deployment in areas neighboring nuclear
power plants.
(4) Response in Outer Space and Cyberspace
(a) Promoting Utilization of Outer Space
The SDF will continue to enhance information gathering
capabilities through the use of various space satellites equipped
with diverse sensors, and strengthen C3I capabilities by continuing
to develop a sophisticated X-Band satellite communications
system. With a view to ensuring the constant availability of these
capabilities in a variety of contingencies, the SDF will actively
promote space situational awareness efforts, and research on
satellite protection, and work to enhance the resiliency of its
satellites. In making such efforts, given that relevant domestic
organizations and the United States possess the latest technologies
and knowledge related to outer space, the MOD will facilitate
cooperation including in the area of personnel development with
such organizations.
(b) Response to Cyber Attacks
To continuously ensure sufficient security against cyber attacks,
with consideration to enhancing capabilities through joint
operations and efficiency in resource allocations, the SDF will
establish the necessary system by such measures as to enhance the
survivability of the command and control systems and information
communication networks of the three services, to strengthen
capabilities for information gathering and research and analysis,
and to develop a practical training environment where response
capabilities against cyber attacks can be tested. Through its efforts
to secure response capabilities in cyberspace where attackers
have an overwhelming advantage, the SDF may consider the
acquisition of capabilities to prevent them from using cyberspace.
In addition, the SDF will strive to keep abreast of the latest risks,
response measures and technological trends, including through
cooperation with the private sector, and strategic talks and joint
exercises with allies.
Given that it is essential to employ personnel with expertise
on a continuing basis and that methods of cyber attack are
increasingly sophisticated and complicated, the SDF plans to
develop personnel with strong cyber security expertise, through
efforts such as improving the in-house curriculum for specialized
education, expanding learning opportunities at institutions of
higher education at home and abroad, and cultivating expertise
through personnel management efforts.
To enable a comprehensive response to cyber attacks through
a whole-of-government approach, the SDF will enhance close
coordination with relevant government agencies by regularly
providing expertise and MOD/SDF personnel, and improve
training and exercises.
(5) Response to Large-scale Disasters
In the event of a large-scale natural disaster such as the Nankai Trough
earthquake, or a special disaster such as a nuclear emergency, the SDF
will respond by immediately transporting and deploying sufficient
numbers of SDF units, as well as establishing a rotating staff posture
based on a joint operational approach. These efforts will enable a
sustained response over the long term. In these efforts, the SDF will
leverage lessons of vital importance learned from the Great East Japan
Earthquake, to gather information on the extent and nature of the damage
by aircraft from the initial stages of the impact and immediately engage
in rescue activities, for the purpose of protecting people’s lives, In
addition, it will implement prompt emergency reconstruction activities
including elimination of road obstacles indispensable for the private
sector’s efforts including the smooth transportation of relief materials.
With close coordination and cooperation with relevant government
agencies, local governments and private sector organizations, the MOD
will promote such measures as to establish contingency planning and to
conduct training and exercises, and secure alternative capabilities when
the basis for the SDF’s disaster and deployment operations is affected.
(6) Strengthening Intelligence Capabilities
Given that advanced intelligence functions lay the foundation for
MOD/SDF to sufficiently fulfill their roles, the MOD will strengthen
all stages of its intelligence capabilities, including gathering, analyzing,
sharing and securing intelligence.
With regards to the methods for intelligence gathering and
analysis, with a view to flexibly meeting the demands of changes in
the security environment, the MOD will promote the development
and improvement of its intelligence gathering facilities, and


-----

actively utilize the outer space and unmanned aerial vehicles so as
to drastically reinforce its capability to gather intelligence from the
diverse sources including SIGINT and IMINT. In a related move,
the MOD will develop the ability to utilize sophisticated GEOINT
by such means as visualization and prediction of situations with a
variety of information and intelligence overlaid on a map or image,
while promoting the comprehensive and efficient geospatial database
development. The MOD will take measures to enhance its HUMINT
gathering capabilities including by increasing the number of personnel
to be newly dispatched as Defense Attachés. It will also reinforce its
posture for gathering and analyzing information from overseas through
cooperation with the ally and partners, and use of advanced system for
collecting public information.
In an effort to meet the increasingly complex and diverse needs
from policy departments and operational sides, in a timely and precise
manner, in the increasingly severe security environment surrounding
Japan, the MOD will strengthen its comprehensive information
gathering and analysis capabilities, through such efforts as the review
of its recruitment efforts and the composition of its human resources to
develop highly competent analysts, integration and enhancement of its
cross-organizational intelligence curriculum, and regularization of the
efforts to place the intelligence side personnel for a given period in the
policy departments and operational sides.
Considering the importance of information security, under
the current severe fiscal situation, and in pursuit of more efficient
intelligence gathering, the MOD will promote the all-source analysis
expected to create great synergies, through seeking to enhance the
posture of and the effective collection management, and facilitating
complete information sharing between those who need to know,
including relevant government agencies.
2. Stabilization of the Asia-Pacific Region and Improvement of the Global
Security Environments

From the perspective of “Proactive Contribution to Peace” based on the
principle of international cooperation, aimed at stabilizing the Asia-Pacific
region, Japan will enhance bilateral and multilateral cooperative relations
and conduct various activities including training and exercises in a timely
and appropriate manner, as well as actively engage in international peace
cooperation activities to properly address global security challenges. The
following elements will be particularly important to these efforts:
(1) Holding Training and Exercises
In addition to timely and appropriate implementation of SDF training
and exercises, Japan will promote bilateral and multilateral combined
training and exercises in the Asia-Pacific region, proactively and
visibly demonstrating our nation’s resolve and advanced capabilities
focused on regional stabilization. In addition, it will seek to improve
interoperability and build and strengthen practical cooperative
relationships with relevant countries.
(2) Promoting Defense Cooperation and Exchanges
Enhancing mutual understanding and relationships of trust with other
countries and international organizations is important as the cornerstone
of efforts to stabilize the security environment. Japan will take further
steps to promote bilateral and multilateral defense cooperation and
exchanges on various levels not limited to high-level exchanges, but
including unit-level exchanges, such as building and strengthening
cooperative relationships focused on wide-ranging security issues of
common interest including HA/DR, maritime security, and ensuring
the stable use of outer space and cyberspace.
(3) Promoting Capacity Building Assistance
By utilizing the capabilities the SDF has accumulated, the MOD will
help countries concerned to enhance their military capabilities in such
fields as HA/DR, disposal of landmines and unexploded ordnance,
and military medicine, so as to stabilize the security environment, as
well as strengthen relations with defense authorities of those countries.
Cooperating with partners actively engaged in capacity building
such as the United States and Australia, with due consideration for
coordination with diplomatic policies such as the Official Development
Assistance (ODA), Japan will provide effective and efficient support in
capacity building.
(4) Ensuring Maritime Security
For the purpose of maintaining “Open and Stable Seas,” which serve
as the cornerstone of Japan’s peace and prosperity efforts as a maritime
state, and ensuring security of maritime traffic, the MOD will further
cooperate with allies to engage in anti-piracy activities off the coast of
Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden, as well as help gulf countries improve
their own capabilities. In other ocean not surrounding Japan such as
the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, the SDF will also leverage
a variety of opportunities to promote combined training and exercises
with countries which share Japan’s goal of maintaining maritime
security.
(5) Implementing International Peace Cooperation Activities
To immediately commence international peace cooperation


activities, the SDF will reinforce its emergency response and
transport capabilities. To steadily engage in its activities for the long
term, the SDF will work to further ensure the safety of its activities
by strengthening information-gathering and equipment protection
capabilities, as well as continue efforts to improve communications,
supplies, military medicine, and support for families of military
personnel. By improving the capacity of the engineer units which
are highly appreciated at the SDF’s activity areas, the SDF will work
to facilitate international peace cooperation activities that more
effectively meet the needs of the SDF’s activity areas. Japan will
strengthen the development of personnel who can play an active role
in the field of international peace cooperation activity, and will send
more personnel to mission headquarters of the U.N. Peace Keeping
Operation and U.N. Department of peacekeeping operations which
would help Japan in making more contribution in the field.
The Japan Peacekeeping Training and Research Center will expand
its curriculum, and strengthen cooperation with relevant government
agencies, foreign countries, and non-governmental organizations
through efforts such as providing educational opportunities to not only
SDF personnel, but also candidates from various backgrounds.
To correspond to the reality of the U.N. peacekeeping operations,
Japan will continue to consider how it might expand its participation
in such operations.
(6) Cooperating to Promote Arms Control, Disarmament and
Nonproliferation

In order to contribute to various activities in the field of arms control
and disarmament undertaken by the United Nations and other
organizations, Japan will continue its active engagement including its
contribution of personnel to these efforts. Given that proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction and missiles that serve as their means of
delivery pose a severe threat to the peace and stability not only to Japan,
but also to the international community as a whole, in cooperation
with relevant countries and international organizations, Japan will
facilitate efforts towards nonproliferation such as participation in the
Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI).
3. Basic Structure to Maximize Defense Capability
(1) Training and Exercises
To effectively respond to various contingencies and enhance its
deterrence effectiveness, the SDF’s joint training and exercises
and Japan-U.S. bilateral training and exercises will be conducted
in a tailored and visible way. Leveraging the lessons learned from
these training and exercises, the SDF will conduct regular studies
and reviews of its plans to address contingencies. Along with these
efforts, the SDF will expand the use of the good training environment
in Hokkaido, by SDF units across the country, to conduct effective
training and exercises. In addition, the SDF will facilitate active use
of LSTs and transport capabilities of the civilian sector, and improve
unit mobility. Doing so will enable nation-wide deployment of welltrained units stationed in Hokkaido. To carry out effective training
and exercises in the SDF’s southwestern region, where only limited
space is available for SDF training, and accounting for relations with
local communities, the MOD will continue effort to expand the joint/
shared use of U.S. Forces facilities with the SDF. In addition, actively
engaging in bilateral trainings at home and abroad with U.S. Forces
such as the U.S. Marines, the SDF will strive to promptly develop
sufficient amphibious operational capabilities.
Seeking to respond to various situations with a whole-ofgovernment approach, coordination with relevant agencies including
police and firefighters, and the Japan Coast Guard will be reinforced.
In addition, the government will conduct various simulation exercise
and comprehensive training and exercises regarding various situations
including civil protection on a regular basis in a tailored manner.
(2) Operational Infrastructure
Given that SDF camps and bases are indispensable for rapid
deployment and response to various contingencies as well as for
ensuring a sustained response posture for the long term, the resiliency
of military camps and bases will be enhanced. In particular, the SDF
will strengthen its capabilities to immediately rebuild various camp and
base support functions such as runways, information-communication
infrastructure, and stable fuel supply. For the SDF to immediately
utilize civilian airports and ports in contingency situations, necessary
measures will be taken with consideration especially to developing
a deployment structure in the southwestern region. In addition, for
the purpose of establishing readiness capabilities, the SDF will store
necessary ammunition and spare ports in locations most appropriate for
operations, as well as steadily construct and maintain necessary living
quarters surrounding SDF camps and bases. From the perspective
of enabling a sustained response posture over the long term, various
measures supporting families of military personnel will be promoted.
To keep availability ratio of equipment at higher standards with
lower costs, the MOD will conduct research as to what activities hamper


-----

improvement of availability ratio. In addition, given that longer-term
contracts raise predictability and enhance cost-effectiveness, the MOD
will expand the use of its new contract system, Performance Based
Logistics (PBL), under which the price is to be determined according
to realized performance.
(3) Personnel and Education
Given the more advanced and complex equipment, and more diverse and
internationalized missions in recent years, the SDF will, from a longstanding perspective, promote feasible measures to ensure the strength
of its troops and the effective use of personnel amid the severe fiscal
situation, taking into consideration a variety of elements, including
skills, experience, physical strength and morale.
(a) Composition of Ranks and Age Distribution
Given the characteristics of respective units, for the purpose of
achieving a composition of ranks that enables the three services
to accomplish their respective missions in the most appropriate
and sustainable way, the SDF will promote measures to secure
and nurture appropriate-numbers of officers, warrant officers and
sergeants/petty officers equipped with necessary capabilities, as
well as recruit in a planned manner high-quality privates/seaman/
airman.
To ensure an appropriate age distribution, in addition to
reviewing the retirement age of 60, the SDF will work to adjust
the age distribution in the respective officer, warrant officer,
sergeant/petty officer, and private/seaman/airman ranks, by
encouraging early retirement and more appropriately managing
its privates/seaman/airman. While taking into consideration the
status guarantee of SDF personnel, the SDF will conduct research
on new systems for early retirement including systems used
by other countries. With a view to maintaining the proper age
distribution among airplane pilots, the SDF will take measures
to allow them to be re-employed in the private sector. In addition,
the SDF will review the final promotion rate of officers, warrant
officers and sergeants/petty officers, and manage personnel more
appropriately with consideration to personnel’s physical strength
so as to maintain SDF’s strength.
(b) Effective Utilization of Human Resources
In order to more effectively make use of its personnel, including
its female personnel, the SDF will actively reappoint retiring
personnel possessing advanced knowledge, skills and experience
where such personnel prove beneficial to the overall SDF’s
strength.
To enable SDF personnel to pursue their missions with
high morale and a strong feeling of pride, the SDF will promote
measures related to honors and privileges including expansion of
the Defense Meritorious Badge program.
In order to strengthen the joint operations structure, the SDF
will enhance education and training, and, through secondment to
the Joint Staff Office and relevant ministries and agencies, retain
adequate personnel in the government who have a broad outlook
and ideas, as well as wide-ranging experience in Japan’s securityaffairs, and who can respond flexibly and rapidly to a variety of
situations.
(c) Recruitment and Re-employment Support
In light of the deteriorating recruiting environment, resulting from
social factors such as the declining birthrate and the increased
pursuit of higher education, in order to continue to secure competent
personnel in the coming years, the SDF will work to enhance public
understanding of national defense and security issues, effectively
engage in public relations to adjust to the changing times, and
coordinate and cooperate with relevant ministries and agencies and
local governments, so as to spread the perception that the SDF is an
attractive job option.
As it is the responsibility of the Government of Japan (GOJ)
to provide financially for SDF personnel, compelled to resign
at a younger age than ordinary civil servants, by strengthening
collaboration with local governments and relevant organizations,
through sharing the knowledge, skills and experience of retired
SDF personnel with society, the GOJ will facilitate such efforts
as measures to provide more incentives for companies to employ
retired SDF personnel, and encourage employment of retired SDF
personnel in the public sector, so as to improve their re-employment
environment.
(d) Utilization of Personnel including Reserve Staff
In order to support sustainable unit operations in situations that
are becoming increasingly diversified and protracted, the SDF will
promote the use of ready reserve personnel and reserve personnel
in broad areas To that end, the SDF will facilitate the appointment
of reserve personnel and their assignment to duties commensurate
with their specialized knowledge and skills including possible
opportunities to work at headquarters, and will also improve training


for call-ups. Aiming at active use of the private sector s transport
capabilities, necessary measures will be taken to utilize reserve
personnel including those who have experience as ship crew. The
SDF will also encourage the appointment of reserve personnel
equipped with specialized skills, including airplane pilots who
the SDF releases to the private sector for re-employment. Other
necessary measures will be taken as well with broad consideration to
using reserve personnel, including for call-ups in various situations.
Furthermore, to increase the adequacy of reserve personnel, the
SDF will seek to increase public awareness of the reserve program,
and take measures to provide more incentives for reserve personnel
themselves and companies to employ reserve personnel.
(4) Medical
In order to keep SDF personnel in good health and enhance its military
medicine capabilities to enable the SDF to cope with a diverse range
of missions in responses to various situations and international peace
cooperation activities, the SDF will upgrade its hospitals to hubs with
enhanced functions, and promote the formation of networks across
hospitals and medical treatment rooms. Along with contributions to
medical services in local communities, the SDF will establish an efficient
and high-quality medical care structure, including improvements in
the management of the National Defense Medical College Hospital.
By reinforcing education for medical officers, nurses and emergency
medical technicians, the SDF will make efforts to secure personnel with
more specialized and advanced skills. In addition, the SDF will consider
such matters as revision of regulations of emergency medical treatment
on situation responses, and improve frontline first aid capabilities, and
will put in place a posture for rapid medical evacuation that takes into
account the need for enhanced joint service capabilities. Furthermore,
the SDF will also reinforce the functions of the National Defense
Medical College, establishing it as a hub for education, and research in
the field of defense medical science.
(5) Defense Production and Technology Base
Retaining an adequate level of defense production and a technology
base is essential not only for the production, operation, sustainment
of equipment, but also for research and development of equipment
that fits the operational environment in Japan, and for the expected
potential to contribute to enhancing deterrence. Given that and Japan’s
intention to maintain and reinforce above-mentioned base, the MOD
will formulate a strategy that sets forth its future vision for Japan’s
defense production and technology base as a whole.
With a view to enhancing the technological capability and
improving productivity of Japan’s defense production and technology
base, as well as increasing global competitiveness, Japan will
actively promote cooperation on defense equipment and technology
development, such as through international joint development and
production with other countries including the United States and the
United Kingdom, utilizing the technological fields where Japan enjoys
an advantage. In coordination with relevant government agencies,
the MOD will promote adapting defense equipment, such as aircraft
developed by the MOD/SDF, to civilian uses.
The MOD will promote international joint development and
production and civilian uses of defense equipment in a way that benefit
both manufacturers and the government.
(6) Efficient Acquisition of Equipment
To carry out effective and efficient acquisition of equipment, a project
manager system will be introduced so as to enhance consistent project
management including insertion of a technological perspective
throughout the life-cycle of equipment design, R&D, full rate
production, acquisition, sustainment, capability upgrade and eventual
disposal. In relevant efforts, the MOD will establish a database of
past contracts, which it will use to develop a simulation model for
price estimation, so as to enable independent estimates of more
appropriate acquisition prices. While utilizing the private sector’s
knowledge, the MOD will actively train and appoint personnel to
positions that require knowledge, skills and specialized expertise in
the acquisition of equipment, such as specialists in cost analysis. In
addition, the MOD will develop a system that allows for reconsideration, including review of specifications and project plans, when
there is a significant discrepancy between the estimated life-cycle
cost derived from the analysis concerned and the real value of the
life-cycle costs.
To allow for prompt and efficient acquisitions, while ensuring
transparency and fairness, parties available for negotiated contracts
will be sorted and ranked as necessary so as to be useful. To diversify
contract types and allow for the efficient acquisition of various
equipment, the government will take necessary measures after
considering further development of its contract system, to incentivize
companies to lower prices, introduce longer-term contracts, which
raise the predictability for companies and lead to lower costs, and
establish a flexible system for accepting orders such as, the use of a


-----

consortium that enables convergence of technologies from respective,
globally competitive companies.
(7) Research and Development (R&D)
Taking cost-effectiveness into account under Japan’s severe fiscal
situation, the MOD will prioritize R&D projects that best meet the
operational needs of the SDF.
In order to strengthen its air defense capabilities, the MOD will
promote technical review of next-generation surface-to-air guided
missiles in view of replacing the functions both of the GSDF middlerange surface-to-air guided missile and the ASDF PATRIOT surfaceto-air guided missiles. In addition, the MOD will promote strategic
studies including empirical research to accumulate and enhance
fighter aircraft-related technologies in Japan so as to keep an option
for development of next-generation fighter aircraft including the
possibility of international joint development of an aircraft to replace
the F-2 when it is time to retire it. Based on the findings, the MOD will
take necessary measures. In an effort to improve ISR capability, the
MOD will promote development of SIGINT aircraft as well as research
on new fixed air defense radar, and sonars with higher detecting
capabilities through simultaneous use of multiple sonars. In addition,
the MOD will conduct research on unmanned equipment available
for flexible operations in case of various contingencies including
large-scale natural disasters, and promote R&D to improve existing
equipment including vehicles, ships and aircraft.
With a view to addressing emerging threats and securing
technological advantage in the areas of strategically important
fields, the MOD will set a vision of future equipment which shows a
direction of medium- and long-term R&D with regard to development
of major equipment, in order to systematically conduct advanced
research from medium and long term perspectives. It will do this
while considering the latest trends in science and technology, changes
in battle field techniques, the potential for international joint research
and development, and availability of effective joint operations among
major pieces of equipment.
From a security standpoint, the MOD will also make an effort to
actively utilize civilian technologies applicable to defense needs (dualuse technologies) by such means as enhancement of coordination with
universities and research institutions, while strengthening the function
of technology control to prevent outflow of advanced technologies.
In doing so, the MOD will always pay attention to keeping abreast
of scientific technological trends including information relevant
to technological development and gathering industry-academicgovernment strengths. In a related effort, the MOD will also promote
to have military technologies employed in civilian activities.
In order to achieve effective and efficient R&D in consideration
of the items stated above, the MOD will re-examine its research and
development posture, and take necessary measures.
(8) Collaboration with Local Communities
As it is essential to closely coordinate with local governments in such
efforts as effective response to various contingencies, and recruitment
and re-employment support for SDF personnel, in pursuit of facilitated
harmonization between defense facilities and their surrounding local
communities, the MOD will continue to advance measures targeting the
areas around defense facilities, as well as engage in various measures
such as intensive public relations activities focused on their policies
and activities, in order to secure the understanding and cooperation of
local governments and communities.
Given that the presence of SDF units makes a substantial
contribution to the maintenance and revitalization of local communities
in some areas, and supports medical services in communities through
emergency patient transport by SDF search and rescue aircraft, etc.,
the MOD/SDF will give consideration to the attributes of each area in
the reorganization of units, and deployment and administration of SDF
camps and bases, etc. in order to secure the understanding of local
governments and residents. In these efforts, based on the governmental
contract policies vis-a-vis small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs), while considering efficiencies, the MOD will promote various
measures conducive to local economies such as securing opportunities
for local SMEs to receive orders.
(9) Boosting Communication Capabilities
Given that understanding and support from Japanese people and foreign
countries are of utmost importance for successful accomplishment of
SDF missions, the MOD will strive to provide information actively and
effectively via various media sources such as social media networks
with due consideration to consistency in the information content.
Efforts to provide information to foreign countries about MOD/SDF
activities abroad will be facilitated by such means as improvement of
its English web site.


(10) Enhancing its Intellectual Base
To enhance understanding among Japanese citizens on security and
crisis management, the MOD will contribute to the promotion of
education on security-related matters at educational institutions,
including by MOD personnel presenting academic papers and sending
MOD lecturers as experts in security and crisis management. The role
of the National Institute for Defense Studies (NIDS) as a think tank
associated with the MOD will be strengthened, through such efforts
as facilitating coordination with policy-making divisions by relocating
the institute to the Ichigaya district (where the MOD’s headquarters
is located), and to by promoting academic exchanges with foreign
research institutions. The MOD will also strive to administer the NIDS
in such a way that it is capable of dealing with policy issues that the
MOD faces in a timely and appropriate manner.
(11) Promoting Reform of the MOD
The MOD will further promote its reforms by regularly reviewing its
work methods and organization in order to foster a sense of unity among
civilian officials and uniformed personnel, and to optimize the buildup of defense capabilities, promote SDF joint operation functions and
enhance policy-making and communication functions. In doing so, with
the intention of optimizing its defense force build-up, the MOD will
establish a planning system for defense build-up with a focus on joint
operation-based capability assessments, and take measures to facilitate
efficiency and optimization in acquisition of equipment, keeping in mind
an option to establish a new agency in the MOD. Also, to enhance the
prompt and efficient operation of the SDF, by such effort as integration
of duties related to actual unit operations into the Joint Staff Office, the
MOD will eliminate overlapping duties in the Internal Bureau and the
Joint Staff Office, and conduct an organizational review including the
reorganization or disbanding of the Bureau of Operational Policy.
**IV. Measures for Strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance**

Reference 16 Outline of Cabinet Decision and Legislation Development

|Items of the Cabinet Decision|Outline|Legislation Development|
|---|---|---|
|1. Response to an Infringement that Does Not Amount to an Armed Attack|• Under the basic policy that relevant agencies including the police and Japan Coast Guard are to respond in close cooperation in accordance with their respective duties and authorities, the Government will further strengthen necessary measures in all areas, including enhancing the respective agency’s response capabilities and strengthening collaboration among agencies. In cases of responding to a situation where police forces are not present nearby or police agencies cannot respond immediately, the Government will consider measures for issuing orders swiftly and accelerating procedures for public security operations or maritime security operations. • The Government will develop legislation that enables the SDF to carry out very passive and limited “use of weapons” to the minimum extent necessary to protect weapons and other equipment of the units of the U.S. and other countries’ Armed Forces that are, in cooperation with the SDF, currently engaged in activities that contribute to the defense of Japan (including joint exercises), in line with the provisions of Article 95 of the Self-Defense Forces Law.|* Acceleration of procedures to issue orders for public security operations/maritime security operations * Revision of the Self-Defense Forces Law (Protection of weapons and other equipment of the units of the U.S. and other countries’ Armed Forces)|
|2. Further Contributions to the Peace and Stability of the International Community|• So-called Logistics Support and “Integration with the Use of Force” (*1) ➢ The Government is of the recognition that Japan’s support activities such as supply and transportation conducted at a place which is not “the scene where combat activities are actually being conducted” by a foreign country are not regarded as “Integration with the use of force” of that country. Based on that recognition, the Government will proceed with developing legislation which enables necessary support activities for the armed forces of foreign countries engaging in activities for ensuring Japan’s security or for the peace and stability of the international community. ➢ Japan does not conduct support activities in “the scene where combat activities are actually being conducted” by armed forces of a foreign country to which Japan provides support. ➢ Japan will immediately pause or cease support activities if the place where Japan is conducting support activities becomes “the scene where combat operations are actually being conducted” due to changes in the situation. • Use of Weapons Associated with International Peace Cooperation Activities Based on the following positions, the Government will proceed with developing legislation in order to enable the SDF’s use of weapons associated with so-called “kaketsuke-keigo” (coming to the protection of individuals related to operations in response to urgent requests) and the “use of weapons for the purpose of execution of missions” in international peace cooperation activities that do not involve the “use of force,” including U.N. peacekeeping operations, as well as police-like activities that do not involve the “use of force,” including the rescuing of Japanese nationals with the consent from the territorial State. ➢ As for U.N. peacekeeping operations, etc., under the framework of the Five Principles for PKOs, “a quasi-state organization” (*2) other than parties to the conflict who have given consent of acceptance is, in principle, not expected to appear as an adversary. ➢ When the SDF units conduct police-like activities that do not involve “use of force” including the rescuing of Japanese nationals in a foreign country based on the consent of the territorial State’s Government, it is natural that the activities be conducted in the area within which the consent of the territorial State’s Government is valid, i.e. the area within which its authority is maintained. This means that no “quasi-state organization” exists in that area. ➢ The Cabinet will make a decision on whether the consent of acceptance is stably maintained and whether the area within which the consent of the territorial State’s Government is valid, etc., based on deliberations, etc., at the National Security Council.|* The Act Concerning the Measures for the Peace and Security of Japan in Situations That Will Have an Important Influence on Japan’s Peace and Security (Revision of the Act Concerning the Measures for the Peace and Security of Japan in Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan), Revision of the Ship Inspection Operations Act, Enactment of the International Peace Support Act * Revision of the International Peace Cooperation Act, revision of the Self- Defense Forces Law (Rescue of measures for Japanese nationals overseas)|
|3. Measures for Self- Defense Permitted under Article 9 of the Constitution|• The Government understands that not only when an armed attack against Japan occurs but also when an armed attack against a foreign country that is in a close relationship with Japan occurs and as a result threatens Japan’s survival and poses a clear danger to fundamentally overturn people’s right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, and when there is no other appropriate means available to repel the attack and ensure Japan’s survival and protect its people, use of force to the minimum extent necessary should be interpreted to be permitted under the Constitution as measures for self-defense in accordance with the basic logic of the Government’s view to date. • The aforementioned “use of force” permitted under the Constitution could have, under international law, a basis on the right of collective self-defense. Although this “use of force” includes that which is triggered by an armed attack occurring against a foreign country, it is permitted under the Constitution only when it is taken as a measure for self- defense which is inevitable for ensuring Japan’s survival and protecting its people, in other words for defending Japan. • The Government will stipulate in the draft legislation that the prior approval of the Diet is in principle required upon issuing orders for operations to the SDF for carrying out “use of force” permitted under the Constitution when an armed attack occurs not against Japan but against a foreign country, in the same manner as the procedures related to defense operations stipulated in the current laws and regulations.|* Revision of Legislation for Responses to Armed Attack Situations, revision of the Self-Defense Forces Law (The provision concerning defense operations) etc.|



Notes: 1. As for Japan’s support activities, however, legal frameworks limiting the area of such activities to “rear area” or so-called “non-combat area,” etc., have been established in past legislations to
ensure that the issue of “integration with the use of force” (forming an “integral part” of the use of force) does not arise, in relation to Article 9 of the Constitution. This is intended to avoid Japan
from being legally evaluated as carrying out by itself the “use of force” which is not permitted under the Constitution because its support activities would form an “integral part” of the use of
force (“integration with the use of force”) by other countries.

2. Use of weapons associated with so-called “kaketsuke-keigo” (coming to the aid of geographically distant units or personnel under attack) or “use of weapons for the purpose of the execution
of missions” could constitute the “use of force” prohibited by Article 9 of the Constitution if such use of weapons is directed against “a state or a quasi-state organization.”

Reference 19 The Guidelines for Japan U.S. Defense Cooperation
(April 27, 2015)

**I. Defense Cooperation and the Aim of the Guidelines**
In order to ensure Japan’s peace and security under any circumstances,
from peacetime to contingencies, and to promote a stable, peaceful, and
prosperous Asia-Pacific region and beyond, bilateral security and defense
cooperation will emphasize:

-  seamless, robust, flexible, and effective bilateral responses;
-  synergy across the two governments’ national security policies;
-  a whole-of-government Alliance approach;
-  cooperation with regional and other partners, as well as international
organizations; and

-  the global nature of the Japan-U.S. Alliance.
The two governments will continuously enhance the Japan-U.S.
Alliance. Each government will maintain its individual defense posture
based on its national security policy. Japan will possess defense capability
on the basis of the “National Security Strategy” and the “National Defense
Program Guidelines.” The United States will continue to extend deterrence
to Japan through the full range of capabilities, including U.S. nuclear
forces. The United States also will continue to forward deploy combatready forces in the Asia-Pacific region and maintain the ability to reinforce
those forces rapidly.
The Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation (“the
Guidelines”) provide the general framework and policy direction for the
roles and missions of Japan and the United States, as well as ways of
cooperation and coordination, with a view to improving the effectiveness
of bilateral security and defense cooperation. In this way, the Guidelines
advance peace and security, deter conflict, secure the basis for economic
prosperity, and promote domestic and international understanding of the
significance of the Japan-U.S. Alliance.
**II. Basic Premises and Principles**
The Guidelines, as well as actions and activities under the Guidelines, are
and will be consistent with the following basic premises and principles.
A. The rights and obligations under the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation
and Security between Japan and the United States of America (the
Japan-U.S. Security Treaty) and its related arrangements, as well as
the fundamental framework of the Japan-U.S. Alliance, will remain
unchanged.
B. All actions and activities undertaken by Japan and the United States
under the Guidelines will be consistent with international law,
including the Charter of the United Nations and its provisions regarding
the peaceful settlement of disputes and sovereign equality of States, as
well as other relevant international agreements.
C. All actions and activities undertaken by Japan and the United States
will be in accordance with their respective constitutions, laws, and
regulations then in effect, and basic positions on national security
policy. Japan will conduct actions and activities in accordance with
its basic positions, such as the maintenance of its exclusively national
defense-oriented policy and its three non-nuclear principles.
D. The Guidelines do not obligate either government to take legislative,
budgetary, administrative, or other measures, nor do the Guidelines
create legal rights or obligations for either government. Since the
objective of the Guidelines, however, is to establish an effective
framework for bilateral cooperation, the two governments are expected
to reflect in an appropriate way the results of these efforts, based on
their own judgment, in their specific policies and measures.
**III. Strengthened Alliance Coordination**
Effective bilateral cooperation under the Guidelines will require the two
governments to conduct close, consultative dialogue and sound policy and
operational coordination from peacetime to contingencies.
The two governments must be well informed and coordinate at
multiple levels to ensure successful bilateral security and defense
cooperation. To that end, the two governments will take advantage of all
available channels to enhance information sharing and to ensure seamless
and effective whole-of-government Alliance coordination that includes all
relevant agencies. For this purpose, the two governments will establish
a new, standing Alliance Coordination Mechanism, enhance operational
coordination, and strengthen bilateral planning.
A. Alliance Coordination Mechanism
Persistent and emerging threats can have a serious and immediate
impact on the peace and security of Japan and the United States. In
order to address seamlessly and effectively any situation that affects
Japan’s peace and security or any other situation that may require
an Alliance response, the two governments will utilize the Alliance
Coordination Mechanism. This mechanism will strengthen policy
and operational coordination related to activities conducted by the
Self-Defense Forces and the United States Armed Forces in all
phases from peacetime to contingencies. This mechanism also will
contribute to timely information sharing as well as the development
and maintenance of common situational awareness. To ensure effective


coordination, the two governments will establish necessary procedures
and infrastructure (including facilities as well as information and
communication systems) and conduct regular training and exercises.

The two governments will tailor to the situation the procedures for
coordination as well as the exact composition of participating agencies
within the Alliance Coordination Mechanism structure. As part of
these procedures, contact information will be shared and maintained
from peacetime.
B. Enhanced Operational Coordination
Enhanced bilateral operational coordination for flexible and responsive
command and control is a core capability of critical importance to Japan
and the United States. In this context, the two governments recognize the
continued importance of collocating operational coordination functions
to strengthen cooperation between the Self-Defense Forces and the
United States Armed Forces.

The Self-Defense Forces and the United States Armed Forces
will exchange personnel to ensure robust information sharing, to
facilitate coordination from peacetime to contingencies, and to support
international activities. The Self-Defense Forces and the United States
Armed Forces, in close cooperation and coordination, will take action
through their respective chains-of-command.
C. Bilateral Planning
The two governments will continue to develop and update bilateral
plans to ensure smooth and effective execution of coordinated
operations by the Self-Defense Forces and the United States Armed
Forces. To ensure the effectiveness of the plans and the ability to make
flexible, timely, and appropriate responses, the two governments will
exchange relevant information, including identifying operational and
logistic support requirements and sources in advance, as appropriate.

The two governments will conduct bilateral planning in
peacetime for contingencies relevant to Japan’s peace and security
through an upgraded Bilateral Planning Mechanism, which includes
relevant agencies of the respective governments. Bilateral plans will
be developed with input from relevant agencies, as appropriate. The
Security Consultative Committee (SCC) will continue to be responsible
for presenting directions, validating the progress of the planning under
the mechanism, and issuing directives as necessary. The SCC will be
assisted by an appropriate subordinate body.

Bilateral plans are to be reflected appropriately in the plans of both
governments.
**IV. Seamlessly Ensuring Japan’s Peace and Security**
Persistent and emerging threats can have a serious and immediate
impact on Japan’s peace and security. In this increasingly complex
security environment, the two governments will take measures to ensure
Japan’s peace and security in all phases, seamlessly, from peacetime to
contingencies, including situations when an armed attack against Japan
is not involved. In this context, the two governments also will promote
further cooperation with partners.
The two governments recognize that these measures need to be taken
based on flexible, timely, and effective bilateral coordination tailored to
each situation and that interagency coordination is essential for appropriate
Alliance responses. Therefore, the two governments will utilize the wholeof-government Alliance Coordination Mechanism, as appropriate, to:

-  assess the situation;
-  share information; and
-  develop ways to implement the appropriate Alliance response, including
flexible deterrent options, as well as actions aimed at de-escalation.
To support these bilateral efforts, the two governments also will
coordinate strategic messaging through appropriate channels on issues that
could potentially affect Japan’s peace and security.
A. Cooperative Measures from Peacetime
In order to ensure the maintenance of Japan’s peace and security,
the two governments will promote cooperation across a wide range
of areas, including through diplomatic efforts, to strengthen the
deterrence and capabilities of the Japan-U.S. Alliance.

The Self-Defense Forces and the United States Armed Forces
will enhance interoperability, readiness, and vigilance to prepare for
all possible situations. To these ends, the two governments will take
measures, including, but not limited to, the following:
1. Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance
In order to identify at the earliest possible stage any indications
of threats to Japan’s peace and security and to ensure a decisive
advantage in intelligence gathering and analysis, the two
governments will share and protect information and intelligence,
while developing and maintaining common situational awareness.
This will include enhancing coordination and cooperation among
relevant agencies.

The Self-Defense Forces and the United States Armed Forces
will conduct intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR)
activities based on the capabilities and availability of their respective
assets. This will include conducting bilateral ISR activities in


-----

a mutually supportive manner to ensure persistent coverage of
developments that could affect Japan’s peace and security.
2. Air and Missile Defense
The Self-Defense Forces and the United States Armed Forces will
maintain and strengthen deterrence and their defense postures against
ballistic missile launches and aerial incursions. The two governments
will cooperate to expand early warning capabilities, interoperability,
network coverage, and real-time information exchange and to
pursue the comprehensive improvement of capabilities to respond to
the threat of ballistic missiles. Moreover, the two governments will
continue to coordinate closely in responding to provocative missile
launches and other aerial activities.
3. Maritime Security
The two governments will cooperate closely with each other on
measures to maintain maritime order based upon international law,
including freedom of navigation. The Self-Defense Forces and
the United States Armed Forces will cooperate, as appropriate, on
various efforts such as maintaining and enhancing bilateral presence
in the maritime domain through ISR and training and exercises,
while further developing and enhancing shared maritime domain
awareness including by coordinating with relevant agencies, as
necessary.
4. Asset Protection
The Self-Defense Forces and the United States Armed Forces will
provide mutual protection of each other’s assets, as appropriate, if
engaged in activities that contribute to the defense of Japan in a
cooperative manner, including during training and exercises.
5. Training and Exercises
The Self-Defense Forces and the United States Armed Forces
will conduct effective bilateral and multilateral training and
exercises both inside and outside of Japan in order to strengthen
interoperability, sustainability, and readiness. Timely and realistic
training and exercises will enhance deterrence. To support these
activities, the two governments will cooperate to ensure that training
areas, facilities, and associated equipment are available, accessible,
and modern.
6. Logistic Support
Japan and the United States are primarily responsible for providing
logistic support for their respective forces in all phases. The SelfDefense Forces and the United States Armed Forces will provide
mutual logistic support where appropriate, including, but not limited

the Government of Japan and the Government of the United States
of America Concerning Reciprocal Provision of Logistic Support,
Supplies and Services between the Self-Defense Forces of Japan and
the Armed Forces of the United States of America (the Acquisition
and Cross-Servicing Agreement) and its related arrangements.
7. Use of Facilities
In order to expand interoperability and improve flexibility and
resiliency of the Self-Defense Forces and the United States
Armed Forces, the two governments will enhance joint/shared
use and cooperate in ensuring the security of facilities and areas.
Recognizing the importance of being prepared for contingencies, the
two governments also will cooperate in conducting site surveys on
facilities including civilian airports and seaports, as appropriate.
B. Responses to Emerging Threats to Japan’s Peace and Security
The Alliance will respond to situations that will have an important
influence on Japan’s peace and security. Such situations cannot
be defined geographically. The measures described in this section
include those that may be taken, in accordance with the two countries’
respective laws and regulations, in circumstances that have not yet
amounted to such a situation. Early recognition and adaptable, resolute
decision-making on bilateral actions will contribute to deterrence and
de-escalation of such situations.
In addition to continuing cooperative measures from peacetime,
the two governments will pursue all avenues, including diplomatic
efforts, to ensure the peace and security of Japan. Utilizing the Alliance
Coordination Mechanism, the two governments will take additional
measures, based on their own decisions, including, but not limited to,
those listed below.
1. Noncombatant Evacuation Operations
When Japanese and U.S. noncombatants need to be evacuated from
a third country to a safe haven, each government is responsible for
evacuating its own nationals, as well as dealing with the authorities
of the affected area. As appropriate, the two governments will
coordinate in planning and cooperate in carrying out evacuations
of Japanese or U.S. noncombatants. These evacuations will be
carried out using each country’s capabilities such as transportation
means and facilities in a mutually supplementary manner. The two
governments may each consider extending evacuation assistance to


third-country noncombatants.

The two governments will conduct early-stage coordination
through the Alliance Coordination Mechanism, as appropriate,
to carry out cooperation in fields such as the safety of evacuees,
transportation means and facilities, customs, immigration and
quarantine processing, safe havens, and medical services. The two
governments will enhance coordination in noncombatant evacuation
operations from peacetime, as appropriate, including by conducting
training and exercises.
2. Maritime Security
Taking into account their respective capabilities, the two governments
will cooperate closely to enhance maritime security. Cooperative
measures may include, but are not limited to, information sharing
and inspection of ships based on a United Nations Security Council
resolution or other basis under international law.
3. Measures to Deal with Refugees
If a situation develops such that a flow of refugees into Japan
becomes likely or actually begins, the two governments will
cooperate to maintain Japan’s peace and security while handling
refugees in a humane manner consistent with applicable obligations
under international law. Primary responsibility for such refugee
response lies with Japan. The United States will provide appropriate

Reference 20 United States–Japan Roadmap for Realignment
Implementation

 (Washington, DC, May 1, 2006)
**Overview**
On October 29, 2005, the U.S.–Japan Security Consultative Committee (SCC)
members approved recommendations for realignment of U.S. forces in Japan
and related Japan Self-Defense Forces (SDF) in their document, “U.S.– Japan
Alliance: Transformation and Realignment for the Future.” In that document,
the SCC members directed their respective staffs “to finalize these specific and
interrelated initiatives and develop plans, including concrete implementation
schedules no later than March 2006.” This work has been completed and is
reflected in this document.
**Finalization of Realignment Initiatives**
The individual realignment initiatives form a coherent package. When
implemented, these realignments will ensure a life-of-the-alliance presence
for U.S. forces in Japan.
The construction and other costs for facility development in the
implementation of these initiatives will be borne by the Government of Japan
(GOJ) unless otherwise specified. The U.S. Government (USG) will bear
the operational costs that arise from implementation of these initiatives. The
two Governments will finance their realignment associated costs consistent
with their commitments in the October 29, 2005 SCC document to maintain
deterrence and capabilities while reducing burdens on local communities.
**Key Implementation Details**
1. Realignment on Okinawa
(a) Futenma Replacement Facility (FRF)
 The United States and Japan will locate the FRF in a configuration
that combines the Henoko-saki and adjacent water areas of Oura
and Henoko Bays, including two runways aligned in a “V”-shape,
each runway having a length of 1,600 meters plus two 100-meter
overruns. The length of each runway portion of the facility is 1,800
meters, exclusive of seawalls (see attached concept plan dated April
28, 2006). This facility ensures agreed operational capabilities while
addressing issues of safety, noise, and environmental impacts.
 In order to locate the FRF, inclusive of agreed support facilities, in
the Camp Schwab area, necessary adjustments will be made, such
as reconfiguration of Camp Schwab facilities and adjacent water
surface areas.
 Construction of the FRF is targeted for completion by 2014.
 Relocation to the FRF will occur when the facility is fully
operationally capable.
 Facility improvements for contingency use at ASDF bases at
Nyutabaru and Tsuiki related to replacement of Marine Corps Air
Station (MCAS) Futenma capabilities will be made, as necessary,
after conducting site surveys and before MCAS Futenma is returned.
 Requirements for improved contingency use of civilian facilities
will be examined in the context of bilateral contingency planning,
and appropriate arrangements will be made in order to realize the
return of MCAS Futenma.


-----

 In principle, the construction method for the FRF will be landfill.
 The USG does not intend to operate fighter aircraft from this facility.
(b) Force Reductions and Relocation to Guam
 Approximately 8,000 III Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF)
personnel and their approximately 9,000 dependents will relocate
from Okinawa to Guam by 2014, in a manner that maintains unit
integrity. Units to relocate will include: III MEF Command Element,
3rd Marine Division Headquarters, 3rd Marine Logistics Group
(formerly known as Force Service Support Group) Headquarters,
1st Marine Air Wing Headquarters, and 12th Marine Regiment
Headquarters.
 The affected units will relocate from such facilities as Camp
Courtney, Camp Hansen, MCAS Futenma, Camp Zukeran, and
Makiminato Service Area.
 The U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) forces remaining on Okinawa
will consist of Marine Air-Ground Task Force elements, such as
command, ground, aviation, and combat service support, as well as
a base support capability.
 Of the estimated $10.27 billion cost of the facilities and infrastructure
development costs for the III MEF relocation to Guam, Japan will
provide $6.09 billion (in U.S. FY2008 dollars), including $2.8 billion
in direct cash contributions, to develop facilities and infrastructure
on Guam to enable the III MEF relocation, recognizing the strong
desire of Okinawa residents that such force relocation be realized
rapidly. The United States will fund the remainder of the facilities
and infrastructure development costs for the relocation to Guam
estimated in U.S. FY2008 dollars at $3.18 billion in fiscal spending
plus approximately $1 billion for a road.
(c) Land Returns and Shared Use of Facilities
 Following the relocation to the FRF, the return of MCAS Futenma,
and the transfer of III MEF personnel to Guam, the remaining
facilities and areas on Okinawa will be consolidated, thereby
enabling the return of significant land areas south of Kadena Air
Base.
 Both sides will develop a detailed consolidation plan by March
2007. In this plan, total or partial return of the following six
candidate facilities will be examined:
 Camp Kuwae: Total return.
 Camp Zukeran: Partial return and consolidation of remaining
facilities and infrastructure to the extent possible.
 MCAS Futenma: Total return (see FRF section above).
 Makiminato Service Area: Total return.
 aha Port: Total return (relocated to the new facilities, including
additional staging constructed at Urasoe).
 Army POL Depot Kuwae Tank Farm No. 1: Total return.
 All functions and capabilities that are resident in facilities
designated for return, and that are required by forces remaining in
Okinawa, will be relocated within Okinawa. These relocations will
occur before the return of designated facilities.
 While emphasizing the importance of steady implementation of the
recommendations of the Special Action Committee on Okinawa
(SACO) Final Report, the SACO relocation and return initiatives
may need to be reevaluated.
 Camp Hansen will be used for GSDF training. Shared use that
requires no facility improvements will be possible from 2006.
 ASDF will use Kadena Air Base for bilateral training with U.S.
forces, taking into account noise impacts on local communities.
(d) Relationships among Initiatives
 Within the overall package, the Okinawa-related realignment
initiatives are interconnected.
 Specifically, consolidation and land returns south of Kadena depend
on completing the relocation of III MEF personnel and dependents
from Okinawa to Guam.
 The III MEF relocation from Okinawa to Guam is dependent on:
(1) tangible progress toward completion of the FRF, and (2) Japan’s
financial contributions to fund development of required facilities
and infrastructure on Guam.
2. Improvement of U.S. Army Command and Control Capability
 U.S. Army command and control structure at Camp Zama will be
transformed by U.S. FY2008. The headquarters of the GSDF Central
Readiness Force subsequently will arrive at Camp Zama by Japan
FY2012; SDF helicopters will have access to Kastner Heliport on
Camp Zama.
 Along with the transformation of Army headquarters in Japan, a
battle command training center and other support facilities will be
constructed within Sagami General Depot (SGD) using U.S. funding.
 In relation to this transformation, the following measures for efficient
and effective use of Camp Zama and SGD will be implemented.
 Some portions of land at SGD will be returned for local
redevelopment (approximately 15 hectares (ha)) and for road and
underground rail (approximately 2ha). Affected housing units will


be relocated to Sagamihara Housing Area.
 A specified area of open space in the northwest section of SGD
(approximately 35ha) will be provided for local use when not
required for contingency or training purposes.
 Portions of the Chapel Hill housing area of Camp Zama (1.1ha)
will be returned to the GOJ following relocation of affected
housing units within Camp Zama. Further discussions on possible
additional land returns at Chapel Hill will occur as appropriate.
3. Yokota Air Base and Airspace
 ASDF Air Defense Command (ADC) and relevant units will relocate
to Yokota Air Base in Japan FY2010. A bilateral master plan for base
use will be developed to accommodate facility and infrastructure
requirements.
 A bilateral, joint operations coordination center (BJOCC), established
at Yokota Air Base, will include a collocated air and missile defense
coordination function. The USG and GOJ will fund their own required
equipment and systems, respectively, while both sides will coordinate
appropriate funding of shared use equipment and systems.
 The following measures will be pursued to facilitate movement of
civilian aircraft through Yokota airspace while satisfying military
operational requirements.
 Establish a program in Japan FY2006 to inform commercial
aviation entities of existing procedures to transit Yokota airspace.
 Return portions of Yokota airspace to Japanese control by
September 2008; specific portions will be identified by October
2006.
 Develop procedures in Japan FY2006 for temporary transfers of
air traffic control responsibility to Japanese authorities for portions
of Yokota airspace, when not required for military purposes.
 Study the conditions required for the possible return of the entire
Yokota airspace as part of a comprehensive study of options for
related airspace reconfigurations and changes in air traffic control
procedures that would satisfy future patterns of civilian and
military (U.S. and Japanese) demand for use of Japanese airspace.
The study will take into account both the lessons learned from the
Kadena radar approach control (RAPCON) transfer experience
and the lessons learned from experiences with collocation of
U.S. forces and Japanese controllers in Japan. This study will be
completed in Japan FY2009.
 The USG and GOJ will conduct a study of the specific conditions and
modalities for possible civilian-military dual use of Yokota Air Base, to
be completed within 12 months from commencement.
 The study will be conducted on the shared understanding that
dual-use must not compromise military operations and safety or
the military operational capabilities of Yokota Air Base.
 Based upon the outcome of this study, the two governments will
consult and then make appropriate decisions on civilian- military
dual-use.
4. Relocation of Carrier Air Wing from Atsugi Air Facility to Marine Corps
Air Station (MCAS) Iwakuni
 The relocation of Carrier Air Wing Five (CVW-5) squadrons from
Atsugi Air Facility to MCAS Iwakuni, consisting of F/A-18, EA-6B,
E-2C, and C-2 aircraft, will be completed by 2014, subsequent to the
following: (1) completion of necessary facilities, and (2) adjustment of
training airspace and the Iwakuni RAPCON airspace.
 Necessary facilities will be developed at Atsugi Air Facility to
accommodate MSDF E/O/UP-3 squadrons and other aircraft from
Iwakuni, taking into account the continued requirement for U.S.
operations from Atsugi.
 The KC-130 squadron will be based at MCAS Iwakuni with its
headquarters, maintenance support facilities, and family support
facilities. The aircraft will regularly deploy on a rotational basis
for training and operations to MSDF Kanoya Base and Guam. To
support the deployment of KC-l30 aircraft, necessary facilities will be
developed at Kanoya.
 U.S. Marine Corps CH-53D helicopters will be relocated from MCAS
Iwakuni to Guam when the III MEF personnel relocate from Okinawa to
Guam.
 Training airspace and Iwakuni RAPCON airspace will be adjusted to
fulfill safely the training and operational requirements of U.S. forces,
Japan SDF, and commercial aircraft (including those in neighboring
airspace) through coordination by the Joint Committee.
 A bilateral framework to conduct a study on a permanent fieldcarrier
landing practice facility will be established, with the goal of selecting
a permanent site by July 2009 or the earliest possible date thereafter.
 Portions of the future civilian air facility will be accommodated at
MCAS Iwakuni.
5. Missile Defense
 As both sides deploy additional capabilities and improve their
respective ballistic missile defense capabilities, close coordination will
continue.


-----

 The optimum site for deployment of a new U.S. X-Band radar system
has been designated as ASDF Shariki Base. Necessary arrangements
and facility modifications, funded by the USG, will be made before the
radar becomes operational in summer 2006.
 The USG will share X-Band radar data with the GOJ.
 U.S. Patriot PAC-3 capabilities will be deployed to Japan within
existing U.S. facilities and areas, becoming operational at the earliest
possible time.
6. Training Relocation
 Both sides will develop annual bilateral training plans beginning in
Japan FY2007. As necessary, a supplemental plan for Japan FY2006
can be developed.
 Initially, aircraft from three U.S. facilities — Kadena, Misawa, and
Iwakuni — will participate in relocated training conducted from the
following SDF facilities: Chitose, Misawa, Hyakuri, Komatsu, Tsuiki,
and Nyutabaru. Both sides will work toward expanding use of SDF
facilities for bilateral training and exercises in the future.
 The GOJ will improve infrastructure for training relocation at SDF
facilities as necessary after conducting site surveys.
 Relocated training will not diminish the quality of training that is
currently available to U.S. forces in Japan, taking into account facilities
and training requirements.
 In general, bilateral training will commence with participation of
1–5 aircraft for the duration of 1–7 days, and develop over time to
participation of 6–12 aircraft for 8–14 days at a time.
 At those SDF facilities at which terms of joint use are stipulated by
Joint Committee agreements, limitations on the number of joint
training events will be removed. Limitations on the total days and
period per training event for joint use of each SDF facility will be
maintained.
 The USG and GOJ will share costs for bilateral training as appropriate,
bearing in mind the priority of maintaining readiness.

Reference 25 Joint Statement of the Security Consultative Committee

 (August 17, 2017)

Begin Text:
**I. Overview**
The U.S.-Japan Alliance (“the Alliance”) is the cornerstone of the AsiaPacific region’s peace, prosperity, and freedom. This dynamic partnership
is also increasingly important in promoting values shared by both nations,
including freedom, democracy, peace, human rights, free and fair markets,
and the rule of law. The Ministers renewed their resolve to uphold the rulesbased international order amid the challenging security environment.
Today the U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee (“SCC”) charted
a path forward for the Alliance in addressing the ongoing and emerging
threats that pose a challenge to regional peace and security, based on the Joint
Statement by the leaders of both countries on February 10, 2017. The SCC
reaffirmed its commitment to implement the 2015 Guidelines for U.S.-Japan
Defense Cooperation and to pursue further ways to strengthen the Alliance.
The Ministers also reaffirmed the Alliance’s commitment to the security of
Japan through the full range of capabilities, including U.S. nuclear forces.
**II. The Regional Strategic Environment**
The Ministers condemned in the strongest terms North Korea’s recurring
provocations and development of nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities,
which have entered a new phase, and pose an increasing threat to regional
and international peace and stability. The Ministers committed to bolster the
capabilities of the Alliance to deter and respond to these threats. They also
concurred on continuing to pressure North Korea, in cooperation with other
countries, to compel it to take concrete actions to end its nuclear and ballistic
missile programs, and to achieve the complete, verifiable, and irreversible
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The Ministers called on the
international community to comprehensively and thoroughly implement the


United Nations Security Council resolutions including the newly adopted
Resolution 2371. The Ministers strongly encourage China to take decisive
measures to urge North Korea to change its course of action. The Ministers
called on North Korea to end its systematic human rights violations and to
immediately release all foreign nationals held in North Korea, including
Japanese abductees and U.S. citizens.
The Ministers expressed continuing concerns about the security
environment in the East China Sea. They also recalled the situation in early
August 2016. The Ministers reaffirmed the importance of working together to
safeguard the peace and stability of the East China Sea and reconfirmed that
Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty applies to the Senkaku Islands and
that the United States and Japan oppose any unilateral action that seeks to
undermine Japan’s administration of these islands.
The Ministers expressed serious concern about the situation in the South
China Sea and reaffirmed their opposition to unilateral coercive actions by
claimants, including the reclamation and militarization of disputed features,
that alter the status quo and increase tensions. They reiterated the importance
of the peaceful settlement of maritime disputes through full respect for legal
and diplomatic processes, including arbitration. They also emphasized the
importance of compliance with the international law of the sea, as reflected in
the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, including respect for
freedom of navigation and overflight and other lawful uses of the sea. In this
regard, the Ministers recalled the award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal on
July 12, 2016. The Ministers acknowledged the adoption of the framework of
the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea (COC) and look forward to the
conclusion of a meaningful, effective and legally binding COC. The Ministers
underlined the significance of continued engagement in the South China Sea,
including through respective activities to support freedom of navigation,
bilateral and multilateral training and exercises, and coordinated capacity
building assistance.


-----

**III. Strengthening Security and Defense Cooperation**
(1) Alliance Responses
The Ministers confirmed their shared intent to develop specific measures
and actions to further strengthen the U.S.-Japan Alliance, including
through reviewing roles, missions, and capabilities, to ensure seamless
Alliance responses across a full spectrum of situations amid an increasingly
challenging regional security environment. To that end, Japan intends to
expand its role in the Alliance and augment its defense capabilities, with
an eye on the next planning period for its Mid-Term Defense Program. The
United States remains committed to deploying its most advanced capabilities
to Japan. To expedite work already underway in this regard, the Ministers
gave the following guidance to their staffs:

-   Accelerate implementation of the 2015 Guidelines for U.S.-Japan Defense
Cooperation and pursue additional types of cooperation under Japan’s
Legislation for Peace and Security; and,

-   Explore new and expanded activities in various areas, such as Intelligence,
Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), training and exercises, research
and development, capacity building, and the joint/shared use of facilities.
(2) Implementation of the 2015 Guidelines for U.S.-Japan Defense
Cooperation
The Ministers reaffirmed the two Governments' unwavering commitment to
continue implementation of the 2015 Guidelines. The Ministers welcomed
important steps within the Alliance to operationalize mutual asset protection
and to bring into force the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement
(ACSA) as milestones in enhancing bilateral defense cooperation. The
Ministers noted the successful use of the Alliance Coordination Mechanism
(ACM) to respond to regional events. The Ministers reaffirmed the critical
role that U.S. extended deterrence plays in ensuring the security of Japan as
well as the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region, and they expressed
their intention to deepen engagement on this subject through the Extended
Deterrence Dialogue. They also confirmed their shared commitment to
enhance and accelerate cooperation in such areas as bilateral planning, air and
missile defense, non-combatant evacuation operations, defense equipment and
technology cooperation, intelligence cooperation and information security.
The Ministers affirmed their desire to expand bilateral cooperation in space,
particularly in resiliency, Space Situational Awareness, hosted payloads and
satellite communications. They called for deepening consultations in a timely
manner on Alliance responses to serious cyber incidents, underscoring the
critical importance of further enhancing Allied deterrence and defense.
**IV. Trilateral and Multilateral Cooperation**
The Ministers highlighted ongoing Alliance efforts to advance trilateral and
multilateral security and defense cooperation with other partners in the region,
notably the Republic of Korea, Australia, India and Southeast Asian countries.
The Ministers underscored the importance of cooperating to promote a
rules-based international order, taking note of the United States’ continued
commitment to maintain a strong presence in the region and Japan’s initiatives
demonstrated by its “Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy.”
Regarding cooperation with the Republic of Korea, the Ministers
emphasized the need to enhance information-sharing and expand trilateral
exercises, including missile warning, anti-submarine warfare, and maritime
interdiction operations exercises.
Regarding cooperation with Southeast Asian nations, the Ministers
affirmed their intention to further enhance capacity building programs and
defense equipment and technology transfers in areas including maritime
security, defense institution building, and humanitarian assistance and disaster
relief (HA/DR). Recognizing the importance of upholding the maritime order
in the region, the Ministers confirmed their shared commitment to launch a
whole-of-government dialogue on maritime security capacity building, which
would incorporate existing efforts in this regard.
**V. The U.S. Force Presence in Japan**
(1) Realignment of U.S. Forces in Japan
The Ministers, in view of maintaining a robust U.S. force presence in Japan,
reaffirmed the two Governments’ commitment to implement the existing
arrangements for the realignment of U.S. forces in Japan, which aim to
maintain operational and deterrent capability in an increasingly severe security
environment, while also mitigating the impact on local communities and
enhancing support from local communities for the presence and operations
of U.S. forces in Japan.
As an essential element of this effort, the Ministers welcomed the
resumption of Futenma Replacement Facility (FRF) construction and
reconfirmed that the plan to construct the FRF at the Camp SchwabHenokosaki area and adjacent waters is the only solution that addresses
operational, political, financial, and strategic concerns and avoids the
continued use of Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Futenma. The Ministers
reaffirmed the two Governments’ unwavering commitment to the plan and
underscored their strong determination to achieve its completion as soon
as possible and the long-desired return of MCAS Futenma to Japan. In this
context, the Ministers called for the steady implementation of the construction
plan, noting the adverse impact of further delays on the ability of the Alliance
to provide for peace and security.

Plan for Facilities and Areas in Okinawa and their commitment to update the
plan as soon as possible.

of approximately 9,000 U.S. Marine Corps personnel, along with their
associated dependents, from Okinawa to locations outside of Japan, including
Guam. They confirmed the steady implementation of the Guam International
Agreement.
The Ministers welcomed Japan’s commitment to make utmost efforts to
secure a permanent field carrier landing practice facility as soon as possible.
The Ministers confirmed their intent to continue to promote aviation
training relocation, including tilt-rotor/rotary wing training relocation, which
has helped to mitigate the impact of training activity on Okinawa.
(2) Host Nation Support (HNS)
The Ministers welcomed the entry into force of the current Special Measures
Agreement (SMA) in April 2016, which serves as a pillar of the Alliance and
a symbol of Japan’s enduring support for the U.S. military presence in Japan.
The Ministers confirmed that the overall level of HNS is to be maintained
roughly at the Japan Fiscal Year 2015 level. The Ministers reaffirmed that the
Facilities Improvement Program (FIP) funding in the current SMA period is
to be no less than a budget of 20.6 billion yen per year.
(3) Other Issues
The Ministers reaffirmed the two Governments would promote joint/shared
use to enhance interoperability and deterrence, build stronger relationships
with local communities, and strengthen the Self-Defense Forces’ force
posture, including in Japan’s southwestern islands.
The Ministers reiterated their determination to address issues related
to the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) through mutual consultations.
The Ministers welcomed the entry into force of supplementary agreements
regarding environmental stewardship and the civilian component, and they
stressed the importance of steadily implementing these agreements. The
Ministers acknowledged the United States’ enhanced training and orientation

tensions in the South China Sea, including the militarization of outposts, and
to act in accordance with international law.
The United States and Japan strongly urge North Korea to abandon its
nuclear and ballistic missile programs and not to take any further provocative
actions. The U.S.-Japan Alliance is fully capable of ensuring the security

Reference 28 The SACO Final Report

(December 2, 1996)
The Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) was established in
November 1995 by the Governments of Japan and the United States. The two
Governments launched the SACO process to reduce the burden on the people
of Okinawa and thereby strengthen the Japan–U.S. alliance.
The mandate and guidelines for the SACO process were set forth by the
Governments of Japan and the United States at the outset of the joint endeavor.
Both sides decided that the SACO would develop recommendations for the
Security Consultative Committee (SCC) on ways to realign, consolidate and
reduce U.S. facilities and areas, and adjust operational procedures of U.S.
forces in Okinawa consistent with their respective obligations under the
Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security and other related agreements. The
work of the SACO was scheduled to conclude after one year.
The SCC which was held on April 15, 1996, approved the SACO Interim
Report which included several significant initiatives, and instructed the SACO
to complete and recommend plans with concrete implementation schedules
by November 1996.
The SACO, together with the Joint Committee, has conducted a series of
intensive and detailed discussions and developed concrete plans and measures
to implement the recommendations set forth in the Interim Report.
Today, at the SCC, Minister Ikeda, Minister Kyuma, Secretary Perry
and Ambassador Mondale approved this SACO Final Report. The plans and
measures included in this Final Report, when implemented, will reduce the
impact of the activities of U.S. forces on communities in Okinawa. At the same
time, these measures will fully maintain the capabilities and readiness of U.S.
forces in Japan while addressing security and force protection requirements.
Approximately 21 percent of the total acreage of the U.S. facilities and areas
in Okinawa excluding joint use facilities and areas (approx. 5,002ha/12,361
acres) will be returned.
Upon approving the Final Report, the members of the SCC welcomed
the successful conclusion of the yearlong SACO process and underscored
their strong resolve to continue joint efforts to ensure steady and prompt
implementation of the plans and measures of the SACO Final Report. With
this understanding, the SCC designated the Joint Committee as the primary
forum for bilateral coordination in the implementation phase, where specific
conditions for the completion of each item will be addressed. Coordination
with local communities will take place as necessary.
The SCC also reaffirmed the commitment of the two governments to
make every endeavor to deal with various issues related to the presence and
status of U.S. forces, and to enhance mutual understanding between U.S.
forces and local Japanese communities. In this respect, the SCC agreed that
efforts to these ends should continue, primarily through coordination at the
Joint Committee.
The members of the SCC agreed that the SCC itself and the Security SubCommittee (SSC) would monitor such coordination at the Joint Committee
described above and provide guidance as appropriate. The SCC also instructed
the SSC to seriously address the Okinawa-related issues as one of the most
important subjects and regularly report back to the SCC on this subject.
In accordance with the April 1996 Japan–U.S. Joint Declaration on
Security, the SCC emphasized the importance of close consultation on the
international situation, defense policies and military postures, bilateral
policy coordination and efforts towards a more peaceful and stable security
environment in the Asia-Pacific region. The SCC instructed the SSC to pursue
these goals and to address the Okinawa related issues at the same time.

**The SACO Final Report on Futenma Air Station**
**(an integral part of the SACO Final Report)**
 (Tokyo, Japan, December 2, 1996)
1. Introduction
a. At the Security Consultative Committee (SCC) held on December
2, 1996, Minister Ikeda, Minister Kyuma, Secretary Perry, and
Ambassador Mondale reaffirmed their commitment to the Special
Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) Interim Report of April 15,
1996 and the Status Report of September 19, 1996. Based on the SACO
Interim Report, both Governments have been working to determine a
suitable option for the return of Futenma Air Station and the relocation
of its assets to other facilities and areas in Okinawa, while maintaining
the airfield’s critical military functions and capabilities. The Status
Report called for the Special Working Group on Futenma to examine
three specific alternatives: 1) incorporate the heliport into Kadena Air
Base; 2) construct a heliport at Camp Schwab; and 3) develop and
construct a sea-based facility (SBF).
b. On December 2, 1996, the SCC approved the SACO recommendation
to pursue the SBF option. Compared to the other two options, the
SBF is judged to be the best option in terms of enhanced safety and
quality of life for the Okinawan people while maintaining operational
capabilities of U.S. forces. In addition, the SBF can function as a fixed
facility during its use as a military base and can also be removed when
no longer necessary.
c. The SCC will establish a bilateral U.S.–Japan working group under
the supervision of the Security Sub-Committee (SSC) entitled the
Futenma Implementation Group (FIG), to be supported by a team of
technical experts. The FIG, working with the Joint Committee, will
develop a plan for implementation no later than December 1997. Upon
SCC approval of this plan, the FIG, working with the Joint Committee,
will oversee design, construction, testing, and transfer of assets.
Throughout this process, the FIG will periodically report to the SSC on
the status of its work.
2. Decisions of the SCC
a. Pursue construction of an SBF to absorb most of the helicopter
operational functions of Futenma Air Station. This facility will be
approximately 1,500 meters long, and will support the majority of
Futenma Air Station’s flying operations, including an Instrument Flight
Rules (IFR) — capable runway (approximately 1,300 meters long),
direct air operations support, and indirect support infrastructure such
as headquarters, maintenance, logistics, quality-of-life functions, and
base operating support. The SBF will be designed to support basing of
helicopter assets, and will also be able to support short-field aircraft
operations.
b. Transfer 12 KC-130 aircraft to Iwakuni Air Base. Construct facilities at
this base to ensure that associated infrastructure is available to support
these aircraft and their missions.
c. Develop additional facilities at Kadena Air Base to support aircraft,
maintenance, and logistics operations which are currently available at
Futenma Air Station but are not relocated to the SBF or Iwakuni Air
Base.
d. Study the emergency and contingency use of alternate facilities, which
may be needed in the event of a crisis. This is necessary because the
transfer of functions from Futenma Air Station to the SBF will reduce
operational flexibility currently available.
e. Return Futenma Air Station within the next five to seven years, after
adequate replacement facilities are completed and operational.
3. Guiding Principles
a. Futenma Air Station’s critical military functions and capabilities will
be maintained and will continue to operate at current readiness levels
throughout the transfer of personnel and equipment and the relocation
of facilities.
b. To the greatest extent possible, Futenma Air Station’s operations
and activities will be transferred to the SBF. Operational capabilities
and contingency planning flexibility which cannot be supported by
the shorter runway of the SBF (such as strategic airlift, logistics,
emergency alternate divert, and contingency throughput) must be
fully supported elsewhere. Those facilities unable to be located on the
SBF, due to operational cost, or quality-of-life considerations, will be
located on existing U.S. facilities and areas.
c. The SBF will be located off the east coast of the main island of
Okinawa, and is expected to be connected to land by a pier or
causeway. Selection of the location will take into account operational
requirements, airspace and sea-lane deconfliction, fishing access,
environmental compatibility, economic effects, noise abatement,
survivability, security, and convenient, acceptable personnel access to
other U.S. military facilities and housing.
d. The design of the SBF will incorporate adequate measures to ensure
platform, aircraft, equipment, and personnel survivability against
severe weather and ocean conditions; corrosion control treatment
and prevention for the SBF and all equipment located on the SBF;


-----

safety; and platform security. Support will include reliable and secure
fuel supply, electrical power, fresh water, and other utilities and
consumables. Additionally, the facility will be fully self-supporting for
short-period contingency/emergency operations.
e. The Government of Japan will provide the SBF and other relocation
facilities for the use of U.S. forces, in accordance with the U.S.–Japan
Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security and the Status of Forces
Agreement. The two Governments will further consider all aspects of
life-cycle costs as part of the design/acquisition decision.
f. The Government of Japan will continue to keep the people of Okinawa
informed of the progress of this plan, including concept, location, and
schedules of implementation.
4. Possible Sea-Based Facility Construction Methods
Studies have been conducted by a “Technical Support Group” comprised
of Government engineers under the guidance of a “Technical Advisory
Group” comprised of university professors and other experts outside the
Government. These studies suggested that all three construction methods
mentioned below are technically feasible.
a. Pile Supported Pier Type (using floating modules) — supported by a
number of steel columns fixed to the sea bed.

Reference 29 State of Progress of the SACO Final Report


b. Pontoon Type — platform consisting of steel pontoon type units,
installed in a calm sea protected by a breakwater.
c. Semi-Submersible Type — platform at a wave free height, supported
by buoyancy of the lower structure submerged under the sea.
5. The Next Steps
a. The FIG will recommend a candidate SBF area to the SCC as soon
as possible and formulate a detailed implementation plan no later
than December 1997. This plan will include completion of the
following items: concept development and definitions of operational
requirements, technology performance specifications and construction
method, site survey, environmental analysis, and final concept and site
selection.
b. The FIG will establish phases and schedules to achieve operational
capabilities at each location, including facility design, construction,
installation of required components, validation tests and suitability
demonstrations, and transfer of operations to the new facility.
c. The FIG will conduct periodic reviews and make decisions at
significant milestones concerning SBF program feasibility.

Reference 33 Outline of the Act on Special Measures on Smooth Implementation of the Realignment of United States Forces in Japan


1. Purpose

It is critically important to realize the realignment of the United States Forces in Japan (USFJ), in order to contribute to the maintenance of peace and
security in Japan and to mitigate the impact of defense facilities on surrounding residents by all of Japan. In this light, the purpose of this Act is to
contribute to the smooth implementation of USFJ realignment by taking the following special measures, etc.


2. Special Measures, etc.

(1) Realignment grants for municipalities incurring greater impacts

In connection with the realignment of USFJ, the national government designates defense facilities for which it is deemed that consideration must be paid to
their increasing impacts on the stability of the lives of the residents in the surrounding areas. Realignment grants are awarded to municipalities in the area
of such defense facilities, in order to cover the expenses of the projects that contribute to making the residents’ lives more convenient and to developing
industries, if the grants are considered necessary to help carry out the USFJ realignment smoothly and infallibly.

The national government takes into consideration the extent that the stability of the lives of the residents is impacted, and awards the realignment grants

based on both the progress of the measures for achieving realignment and the length of time that has passed since the measures were first implemented.


(2) Public project special provisions for areas incurring particularly large impacts

Designate areas that include municipalities incurring particularly large impacts as Special Area for Development concerning Realignment, and promote the
development of these areas by establishing special provisions for cost sharing by local governments when developing roads, ports, and other infrastructure.
Set up at the MOD the Council for Local Development concerning Realignment of U.S. Forces in Japan and Related SDF Forces comprised of relevant
ministers, and at the Council’s meetings discuss matters such as the designation of the Special Area for Development concerning Realignment and the
establishment of the development plan for the area (Development Plan for Special Area for Development concerning Realignment).


(3) Measures for USFJ local employees


Implement skills education and training that contribute to the continuous employment of USFJ local employees.

3. Expiration of the Law


This Act expires on March 31, 2027; provided, however, that the realignment grants will be awarded until March 31, 2032 at the latest based on
the situation of the realignment.

Notes: 1. At the time of its enactment this Act was set to expire on March 31, 2017. However, the term of validity has been extended by 10 years to March 31, 2027 pursuant
to the law for the partial revision of this Act which entered into force on March 31, 2017.
2. At the time of its enactment, this Act provided for the special measures, etc. under this Act in 2. (1) to (3) above, as well as for special provisions for the operations of
the Japan Bank for International Cooperation for the implementation of investments and loans for family housing and infrastructure development related to USFJ
relocation to the United States of America (Guam) for the promotion of said relocation.
However, the said provision was abolished pursuant to the law for the partial revision of this Act which entered into force on March 31, 2017, after the 2+2 Joint
Statement of April 2012 limited Japan’s financial commitment for the relocation of the U.S. Marine Corps in Okinawa to Guam to direct cash contribution and it was
confirmed that other forms of financial assistance (investments and loans) would not be utilized.

Other Multilateral Security Dialogue Overview


Reference 45  Vientiane Vision: Japan’s Defense Cooperation Initiative with ASEAN


Introduction

Ø “Vientiane Vision: Japan’s Defense Cooperation Initiative with ASEAN” is Japan’s own initiative for the future Japan-ASEAN defense cooperation
Ø Annually follow up the implementation of the specific and practical activities listed in the Vision through the Japan-ASEAN Defense Vice-Ministerial Forum
starting from 2017


Contents

1. Background of Japan-ASEAN Defense Cooperation
(1) The Asia-Pacific region faces increasingly serious challenges for the security, which makes more difficult for any single country to respond alone
(2) ASEAN is a hub for the regional cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region with an increasing importance. Japan and ASEAN have traditionally maintained strong
ties; Further enhancement of bilateral/multilateral cooperation is crucial in ensuring a stable regional security environment
(3) Japan welcomes the establishment of ASEAN Community at the end of 2015 and supports its centrality and unity. Since the establishment, ASEAN-Wide
multilateral cooperation has become even more important, in addition to bilateral cooperation with its individual member states

2. Evolution of Japan-ASEAN Defense Cooperation: deepening “exchanges” toward “cooperation”
(1) Starting defense exchanges from 1990s: enhancing mutual understanding and confidence through defense exchanges
(2) Developing defense cooperation from 2000s: more practical/ operational defense cooperation with ASEAN member states
(3) Deepening defense cooperation from 2010s: starting new projects such as capacity building cooperation with further specific and practical activities and
promoting multilateral cooperation through regional frameworks such as ADMM-Plus

3. Future Direction of Japan-ASEAN Defense Cooperation: Toward the “ASEAN-Wide” Practical Cooperation
(1) Purpose: In addition to the cooperation with “Individual ASEAN Member States,” “ASEAN-Wide” cooperation will be expanded through promoting practical
cooperation with a view to 1. respecting and promoting shared principles such as freedom, democracy and basic human rights, 2. promoting and enhancing the
rule of law, 3. supporting ASEAN efforts to strengthen its centrality and unity which is a cornerstone of regional cooperation
(2) Direction: In order to contribute to regional peace, security and prosperity, future Japan-ASEAN defense cooperation will be focused on the following three points
Ø To consolidate the order based on the principles of international law governing peaceful conduct among states, Japan supports ASEAN efforts to uphold
principles of international law, especially in the field of maritime and air space
Ø To promote maritime security which is a foundation for the regional peace and prosperity, Japan supports ASEAN efforts to build up capabilities for
Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) and Search and Rescue (SAR) at sea and air space
Ø To cope with increasingly diversifying and complex security issues, Japan supports ASEAN efforts to build up capabilities in various fields
(3) Measures: Conducting practical defense cooperation by effectively combining the following diverse measures
1) Promotion of International Law (PIL): sharing understanding and experience regarding international law, especially in the field of maritime security, through i.e.
conducting researches and sponsoring seminars, etc., with a view to its effective implementation.
2) Capacity Building Cooperation (CBC): conducting CBC in various fields such as HA/DR, PKO, landmine and UXO clearance, cybersecurity, defense buildup
planning (sharing know-how), etc.
3) Defense Equipment and Technology Cooperation (DETC): transferring equipment and technology, developing human resources regarding DETC, holding
seminars on defense industries, etc.
4) Joint Training and Exercises (JTE): continued participation in multilateral joint training and exercises, inviting ASEAN observers to Self- Defense Forces’ training, etc.
5) Human Resource Development and Academic Exchange (HRD/AE): Inviting Opinion Leaders from ASEAN, etc.
(4) The JMOD institutional development to better address “ASEAN-Wide” practical cooperation based on the Vision

**Reference 66 Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and**
**Technology**
(Approved by the National Security Council
and the Cabinet on April 1, 2014)
The Government has made it its basic policy to deal with overseas transfer
of defense equipment and technology in a careful manner in accordance
with Prime Minster Eisaku Sato’s remarks at the Diet in 1967 (hereinafter
referred to as “the Three Principles on Arms Exports”) and the collateral
policy guideline by the Miki administration in 1976. These policy guidelines
have played a certain role as Japan has been following the path of a peaceloving nation. On the other hand, these policy guidelines including the nonpermission of arms exports to communist bloc countries have increasingly
proved unsuitable for the current situation. Also, the Government has
repeatedly taken exemption measures depending on the individual necessity
of each case since arms exports to substantially all areas were not permitted,
as a result of not promoting arms exports regardless of the destinations.
Japan has consistently followed the path of a peace-loving nation since
the end of World War II. Japan has adhered to a basic policy of maintaining
an exclusively national defense-oriented policy, not becoming a military
power that poses a threat to other countries, and observing the Three NonNuclear Principles. At the same time, surrounded by an increasingly severe
security environment and confronted by complex and grave national security
challenges, it has become essential for Japan to make more proactive efforts
in line with the principle of international cooperation. Japan cannot secure
its own peace and security by itself, and the international community expects
Japan to play a more proactive role for peace and stability in the world
commensurate with its national capabilities. Against this backdrop, under the
evolving security environment, Japan will continue to adhere to the course
that it has taken to date as a peace-loving nation, and as a major player in
world politics and the world economy, contribute even more proactively
in securing peace, stability and prosperity of the international community,
while achieving its own security as well as peace and stability in the AsiaPacific region, as a “Proactive Contributor to Peace” based on the principle of
international cooperation.
From the view point of achieving the fundamental principle of national
security by implementing concrete policies, the Government, in accordance
with the National Security Strategy adopted on December 17, 2013, decided
to review the Government’s existing policy guidelines on overseas transfer
of defense equipment and technology, and set out clear principles which fit
the new security environment while giving due consideration to the roles that
the existing policy guidelines have played so far and by consolidating the
policy guidelines comprehensively with consideration on the past exemption
measures.
An appropriate overseas transfer of defense equipment and technology
contributes to further active promotion of the maintenance of international


peace and security through timely and effective implementation of
contribution to peace and international cooperation such as international peace
cooperation, international disaster relief, humanitarian assistance, responses
to international terrorism and piracy, and capacity building of developing
countries (hereinafter referred to as “peace contribution and international
cooperation”). Such transfer also contributes to strengthening security and
defense cooperation with Japan’s ally, the United States as well as other
countries. Furthermore, it contributes to maintaining and enhancing Japan’s
defense production and technological bases, thereby contributing to Japan’s
enhancement of defense capability, given that international joint development
and production projects have become the international mainstream in order to
improve the performance of defense equipment and to deal with their rising
costs.
On the other hand, since the distribution of defense equipment and
technology has significant security, social, economic and humanitarian impact
on the international community, the need for each government to control the
transfer of defense equipment and technology in a responsible manner while
taking various factors into account is recognized.
In light of the above, while maintaining its basic philosophy as a peaceloving nation that conforms to the Charter of the United Nations and the course
it has taken as a peace-loving nation, Japan will control the overseas transfer
of defense equipment and technology based on the following three principles.
The overseas transfer of facilities related to arms production will continue to
be treated in the same manner as defense equipment and technology.
**1. Clarification of cases where transfers are prohibited**
Overseas transfer of defense equipment and technology will not be
permitted when:
1) the transfer violates obligations under treaties and other international
agreements that Japan has concluded,
2) the transfer violates obligations under United Nations Security Council
resolutions, or
3) the defense equipment and technology is destined for a country party
to a conflict (a country against which the United Nations Security
Council is taking measures to maintain or restore international peace
and security in the event of an armed attack).
**2. Limitation to cases where transfers may be permitted as well as strict**
**examination and information disclosure**
In cases not within 1. above, cases where transfers may be permitted will be
limited to the following cases. Those cases will be examined strictly while
ensuring transparency. More specifically, overseas transfer of defense
equipment and technology may be permitted in such cases as the transfer
contributes to active promotion of peace contribution and international
cooperation, or to Japan’s security from the viewpoint of—implementing
international joint development and production projects with countries
cooperating with Japan in security area including its ally the U S


-----

(hereinafter referred to as the ally and partners ), —enhancing security
and defense cooperation with the ally and partners, as well as—supporting
the activities of the Self-Defense Forces including the maintenance of its
equipment and ensuring the safety of Japanese nationals. The Government
will conduct strict examination on the appropriateness of the destination
and end user, and the extent the overseas transfer of such equipment and
technology will raise concern for Japan’s security. Then the Government
will make a comprehensive judgment in light of the existing guidelines
of the international export control regime and based on the information
available at the time of export examinations.
Significant cases that require especially careful consideration from the
viewpoint of Japan’s security will be examined at the National Security
Council (NSC). As for the cases that were deliberated at the NSC, the
Government will disclose their information in accordance with the Act
on Access to Information Held by Administrative Organs (Law No. 42
of 1999).
**3. Ensuring appropriate control regarding extra-purpose use or transfer to**
**third parties**
In cases satisfying 2. above, overseas transfer of defense equipment and
technology will be permitted only in cases where appropriate control is
ensured. More concretely, the Government will in principle oblige the
Government of the recipient country to gain its prior consent regarding
extra-purpose use and transfer to third parties. However, appropriate

Reference 67 Activities in Civic Life


control may be ensured with the confirmation of control system at the
destination in such cases as those where the transfer is judged to be
appropriate for active promotion of peace contribution and international
cooperation, when the transfer involves participation in an international
system for sharing parts etc., and when the transfer involves delivery of
parts etc. to a licenser.
Implementation guidelines for the policy described above will be
decided by the NSC. The Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry will
implement the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act (Law No.228 of
1949) appropriately in accordance with the decision.
For the purpose of this policy, “defense equipment and technology”
refers to “arms and military technologies”; “arms” refers to items listed
in Section 1, Annexed List 1 of the Export Trade Control Order (Cabinet
Order No. 378 of 1949), and are to be used by military forces and directly
employed in combat; and “military technologies” refers to technologies
for the design, production or use of arms.
The Government will contribute actively to the peace and stability of
the international community as a “Proactive Contributor to Peace” based
on the principle of international cooperation. Under such policy, it will
play a proactive role in the area of controlling defense equipment and
technology as well as sensitive dual-use goods and technologies to achieve
the early entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty and further strengthen
the international export control regimes.

|Items|Details of Activities and Their Past Records|
|---|---|
|Disposal of Unexploded Bombs1|❍ The GSDF disposes of such bombs at the request of municipal governments and others. ❍ Disposal operations in FY2016: a total of 1,379 disposal operations (average of approximately 27 operations per week), weighing approximately 42.1 tons in total; in particular, the amount of unexploded bombs that were disposed of in Okinawa Prefecture totaled approximately 25.6 tons, (accounting for about 61% of such bombs removed across the nation). (If unexploded bombs are chemical bombs, their disposal is basically beyond the disposal capability of the SDF. However, the SDF is prepared to extend as much cooperation as possible in regard to disposal of such bombs by identifying them and checking for attached fuses.)|
|Removal of Underwater Mines2|❍ The MSDF undertakes minesweeping operations in waters designated as dangerous areas because underwater mines had been laid there during World War II, as well as removes and disposes of explosives after receiving reports from municipal governments and others. ❍ Minesweeping has been almost completed in the dangerous areas. ❍ Disposal operations in FY2016: a total 23,598 units were disposed of, weighing approximately 4.2 tons in total (1 underwater mines disposed). (If explosive hazardous materials are chemical bombs, their disposal is basically beyond the disposal capability of the SDF. However, the SDF is prepared to extend as much cooperation as possible for disposal of such bombs by identifying them and checking for attached fuses.)|
|Medical Activities3|❍ Medical services are provided to the general public at the National Defense Medical College in Tokorozawa, Saitama Prefecture, and some hospitals affiliated with the SDF (seven out of 16 such hospitals, including the SDF Central Hospital in Setagaya Ward, Tokyo). ❍ The National Defense Medical College runs an emergency medical center, which is in charge of providing emergency medical services to seriously injured patients and patients in critical condition. The center is designated as a medical facility providing tertiary emergency services. ❍ In the wake of a disaster, medical units belonging to major SDF units, acting on a request from municipal governments, provide travelling clinics, quarantines and so forth when a disaster occurs. ❍ The GSDF Medical School (Setagaya Ward, Tokyo), MSDF Underwater Medical Center (Yokosuka City, Kanagawa Prefecture), and ASDF Aviation Medicine Laboratory (Tachikawa City, Tokyo and Sayama City, Saitama Prefecture) undertake study on outdoor sanitation, underwater medicine, and aviation medicine, respectively. ❍ The National Defense Medical College Research Institute (Tokorozawa City, Saitama Prefecture) undertakes study on emergency medicine.|
|Cooperation in Supporting Athletic Meetings4|❍ At the request of concerned organizations, the SDF helps operations of the Olympics and Asian games in Japan as well as national sports meetings in the fields of ceremonies, communications, transportation, music performance, medical services, and emergency medical services. ❍ The SDF provides transportation and communication support to marathon events and ekiden road relays.|
|Exchanges with Local Communities|❍ Sports facilities such as grounds, gyms and swimming pools at many of the SDF garrisons and bases are open to general citizens in response to requests from local communities. ❍ Participation in various events sponsored by general citizens and municipal governments or taking part as sports referees and instructors on an individual basis.|

**Reference 70 The Results of the Special Defense Inspection (outline)**

July 27, 2017
The Inspector General’s Office of Legal Compliance


In addition, in February 2017, in order to ensure consistency with
the fact that only the Daily Reports that exist at the JS had been made
public, the Director of Operations Support & Intelligence Department,
GSO deemed this appropriate document management, then, among other
things, requested the disposal of the daily reports, and the Daily Reports
were disposed of. Although this does not directly constitute a violation of
the Information Disclosure Act, it was inappropriate because it could be
said that a request for disposal, etc. was made to make the facts match the
non-disclosure decision by reason of the non-existence of the documents.
(4) Inappropriate response including the delay in reporting to the Minister of
Defense and the public explanation (December 2016-January 2017)
The Director of Operations Support & Intelligence Department, GSO
caused confusion in mutual understanding because he/she explained to
the Administrative Vice Chief of staff, JS that daily reports existed as
personal data while recognizing that the possibility that the daily reports
existing at the GSDF were administrative documents.[*2] Meanwhile, the
Administrative Vice Chief of staff, JS received instructions from the
Minister of Defense to search again for the Daily Reports but did not
instruct the GSO, etc. to conduct a search again. Later, although he/she
confirmed the existence of the Daily Reports, he/she took approximately
one month to make a report to the Minister of Defense. In addition, he/
she did not confirm the state of the GSDF daily reports and was unable to
grasp them accurately. It is inappropriate that the Ministry of Defense was
unable to respond appropriately as the result, having created documents for
public explanation that were different from the facts among other things.
*2 Media reports that the GSO said to the JS civilian officials in this
exchange that “it’s too late to say that they exist” could not be confirmed.
(5) Continuing the posture regarding the public explanation (February 2017)
The Administrative Vice-Minister of Defense and the Administrative Vice
Chief of staff, JS received the explanation from the Chief of Staff, GSDF
and others that the Daily Reports data existed at the CRF Headquarters
but it was unclear whether they were being managed as administrative
documents. The Administrative Vice-Minister of Defense recognized the
data as personal data, did not confirm the state of the GSDF daily reports,
and indicated the policy for public explanation to the effect that there were
no problems as the response under the Information Disclosure Act since
the Ministry of Defense was making the Daily Reports public. In addition,
the abovementioned response to the question was explained to the
Minister of Defense and approved. On that occasion, it was not mentioned
by the Administrative Vice-Minister of Defense or the Administrative
Vice Chief of staff, JS that the Daily Reports existed within the GSDF.
It is inappropriate that because of this, the posture regarding the public
explanation to the effect that the Daily Reports were being appropriately
handled within the GSDF was maintained by the GSDF even though the
opportunity existed to change the posture regarding the public explanation
by confirming the state of the GSDF daily reports.
*3 Separately from this, there was an occasion on which an explanation
was given to the Minister of Defense regarding the handling of daily
reports at the GSDF among other matters. However, although the
possibility cannot be denied that there may have been some statements
regarding the existence of daily report data at the GSDF as part of the
exchange on that occasion, there were no facts to the effect that a report
was made by document indicating the existence of daily report data at
the GSDF or that a report was made seeking approval for nondisclosure.
In addition, there are no facts to the effect that any decision or approval
by the Minister of Defense was made concerning whether or not to
make public.
**5. Rectification Measures**
(1) Implementing appropriate information disclosure operations
A) It is necessary to thoroughly conduct the education, etc. of the related
staff to raise their awareness regarding the appropriate implementation
of information disclosure operations.
B) In the case where it is to be decided that an administrative document
does not exist, it is necessary to conduct multiple searches and to
expand the scope of the searches, actually confirm the state of document
management and otherwise thoroughly conduct meticulous searches


**The Results of the Special Defense Inspection (outline)**

**1. Subject Items**
An inspection was conducted regarding “the state of management of “The
Daily Reports Prepared between July 7-12, 2016 by the GSDF Engineering
Unit Dispatched to South Sudan” (hereinafter referred to as “the Daily
Reports”), for which a disclosure request was made pursuant to the provisions
of the Act on Access to Information Held by Administrative Organs (Act
No.42 of May 14, 1999; hereinafter referred to as “the Information Disclosure
Act”))
**2. Subject Organizations, etc.**
The organizations, etc. of the Ministry of Defense related to the management
of the Daily Reports (Administrative Vice-Minister of Defense, Internal
Bureau, and the Joint Staff (hereinafter referred to as “JS”), the Ground Staff
Office (hereinafter referred to as “GSO”), and the Central Readiness Force
(hereinafter referred to as “CRF”) Headquarters).
**3. Outline of the Inspection Conducted**
The special defense inspection began on March 17, 2017, and the acquisition
and analysis of the related documents, etc., questionnaire surveys, on-site, etc.
confirmation, and interviews were conducted.
**4. The Results of the Inspection**
(1) Inappropriate response to the disclosure request dated July 19[*1] (JulySeptember 2016)
Regarding the disclosure request dated July 19 that is related to the
disclosure request for the Daily Reports, the Vice Commanding General
(international), CRF, while recognizing the existence of daily reports
as administrative documents, provided guidance with the intent that
it was desirable to remove daily reports from such documents and did
not disclose existing daily reports. This is inappropriate since the Daily
Reports were not disclosed pursuant to their disclosure request by reason
of the nonexistence of the documents as the consequence of this response.
It is also inappropriate that disclosure procedures for the documents
excluding daily reports were taken by reason of the non-existence of the
documents even though the GSO and GSO staff were in a situation where
they could recognize the existence of daily reports.
*1 “All documents exchanged during July 6-15, 2016 (Japan Time)
between CRF Headquarters and the GSDF engineering unit dispatched
to South Sudan (including electronic format)”
(2)Inappropriate response to the disclosure request dated October 3 (OctoberDecember 2016)
Regarding the disclosure request for the Daily Reports, it is inappropriate
that the GSO and CRF Headquarters staff, while recognizing the existence
of daily reports as administrative documents, based on the response to the
disclosure request dated July 19, made a non-disclosure determination
by reason of the non-existence of the documents and did not disclose the
Daily Reports, which existed.
It is also inappropriate that non-disclosure procedures were taken by
reason of the non-existence of the documents even though the GSO and JS
staff were in a situation where they could recognize the existence of daily
reports.
(3) Inappropriate response concerning the management of the Daily Reports
(December 2016, February 2017)
In December 2016, the Director of Operations Support & Intelligence
Department, GSO gave guidance regarding the appropriate management
of bulletin boards under the premise that they would be disposed of after
use without taking measures regarding disclosure even though he/she
recognized that nondisclosure procedures had been taken regarding the
disclosure request for the Daily Reports by reason of the non-existence of
the documents. This is inappropriate because it is unavoidable for this to be
interpreted that guidance was given to make the facts fit the non-disclosure
d i i b d h i f h d


-----

C) It is necessary to attempt to strengthen the confirmation function by
such means as implementing the inspection of information disclosure
operations by an organization that has no connection to the information
disclosure procedures. In addition, strive to confirm the appropriateness
of procedures regarding disclosure requests by utilizing regular defense
inspections.
(2) Implementing appropriate document management, etc.
A) It is necessary to take measures to clearly grasp the state of
administrative documents by such means as appropriate indications
of the retention period, etc. on the administrative documents and to
take measures to keep the distribution of sensitive documents to the
smallest number possible
B) It is necessary to review the management manual for administrative
documents such as clarifying the responsibility in the case where
multiple document managers possess the same administrative
document.


(3) Considering how the retention period for daily reports, etc. should be and
the measures to be taken It is necessary for the Ministry of Defense to
swiftly consider how the retention period for daily reports, etc. should be
after the retention period has lapsed and take measures.
**6. Conclusion**
It is necessary to recognize that the understanding and support of the Japanese
public is essential to the activities of the Ministry of Defense and the SelfDefense Forces and that it is extremely important to fulfill the responsibility
to explain to the Japanese public, swiftly take rectification measures, and do
the utmost to secure appropriateness in all types of operations.
