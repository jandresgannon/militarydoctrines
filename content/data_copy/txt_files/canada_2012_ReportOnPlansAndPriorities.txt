### MINISTER’S MESSAGE



It is my pleasure to present to Parliament and Canadians the 2012‐13 Report on
Plans and Priorities for the Department of National Defence and the Canadian
Forces (DND/CF)[1].

Canadians are justifiably proud of the tremendous contributions made by the
Defence team to protect Canadians and support our interests and values around
the world, including contributing to peace and security operations. In 2012‐13,
National Defence will continue to ensure operational excellence by fulfilling the
roles and missions identified in the _Canada First Defence Strategy (CFDS) –_
defending Canada and Canadians, remaining a strong and reliable partner in
defence of North America, and contributing to international peace and security.
This year we will continue to modernize the CF in a fiscally sustainable manner.

Our nation is vast and the CF stand ready to help first responders protect Canada and Canadian citizens by
responding to natural disasters, such as the recent floods in Manitoba and Quebec, and fires in Saskatchewan and
Northern Ontario in 2011. The CF plays a critical role in exercising Canada’s sovereignty in the Arctic by conducting
a number of routine missions and exercises in the region, such as Operation NANOOK. National Defence also works
closely with the United States in the defence of North America through activities such as collaboration within the
North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD) and bilateral discussions on a wide variety of issues. We
will continue to bolster the partnership with our closest ally through bilateral training and exercises to enhance the
ongoing interoperability of our armed forces and the defence of our shared continent in light of evolving security
challenges.

Canadians recognize and deeply appreciate the CF’s sacrifices and achievements in Afghanistan over the last
decade. The Defence team will maintain operational excellence abroad as we continue the important training role
in Afghanistan to which we transitioned in 2011. As demonstrated by their rapid and effective response to events
as they unfolded in Libya, the CF remains prepared to conduct operations around the world as directed by the
Government.

Balancing these roles at home and abroad, while ensuring the CF have the proper leadership, equipment, training
and care, is no small feat. Much of our ability to deliver successfully on these objectives depends on our highly
skilled civilian and military workforce. Continuing to fulfill our CFDS commitments, while maintaining the ability for
rapid deployment and mission success requires significant resources. Following unprecedented recent investments
in DND, the Defence team will now do its part to help balance the budget while working hard to remain an agile,
flexible, affordable and resilient military, capable of meeting the needs of Canadians. Smart investments will help
modernize and rebuild the CF, as well as continue to have a positive impact on Canadian communities by
generating economic opportunities nationwide such as those on both coasts due to the National Shipbuilding
Procurement Strategy (NSPS). It is my privilege to lead this great national institution and I am proud of the
professionalism and dedication displayed by the CF and by DND civilian personnel. I look forward to working with
Parliament and Canadians on strengthening every aspect of the Defence Team.

The Honourable Peter MacKay, P.C., M.P.
Minister of National Defence

### SECTION I: ORGANIZATIONAL OVERVIEW

###### Raison d’être 

On behalf of the people of Canada, the Canadian Forces (CF) and the Department of National Defence


(DND) stand ready to perform three key roles:

Defend Canada – by delivering excellence at home;

Defend North America – by being a strong and reliable partner with the United States in the
defence of the continent; and

Contribute to International Peace and Security – by projecting leadership abroad.

The _National Defence Act[2] establishes DND and the CF as separate entities, operating within an_
integrated National Defence Headquarters, as they pursue their primary responsibility of providing
defence for Canada and Canadians. Defence continues to adapt to an evolving strategic global security
environment and is prepared to meet emerging non‐traditional challenges such as piracy attacks, as well
as traditional ones, including global terrorism, weapons proliferation and the enduring threat of regional
conflicts emerging around the world. In addition to the global financial situation, these factors will
continue to occupy the international agenda and challenge Canada’s security and prosperity.

###### Responsibilities

The Defence Team is committed to achieving success in a number of priority areas over the course of
2012‐13 and beyond. The Department and the CF will continue to focus on ensuring sustainable
operational excellence both at home and abroad, on reconstituting and aligning the CF post‐combat
operations in Afghanistan, on maintaining defence affordability, and on strengthening the Defence
Team. To accomplish this, Defence must be agile, flexible, affordable and resilient, employing and
sustaining a world‐class force with the ability to protect and excel at home; be a strong and reliable
defence partner in North America; and make a meaningful contribution to international security.

Our core responsibility is to succeed in operations within an affordable program, while preparing for
future operational challenges and caring for our military members and their families.

The focus of Defence activities over the 2012‐13 reporting period, as highlighted in this report, are as
follows:

Conduct training operations in Afghanistan within the construct of NATO/ISAF in order to
enhance Afghan security by contributing to the development of Afghan Security Forces;

Continue to deliver on our Defence Priorities while supporting the Government of Canada’s
national and international priorities; and

Carrying out the defence mission while deftly managing the Department’s resources, given the
current global financial situation.

With the volatile world economy as a backdrop, the evolving security environment continues to occupy
the international agenda; security challenges include terrorism, the enduring threat of regional conflicts,
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons, insurgencies and cyber
attacks, piracy, and popular uprisings for democratic reform. The Defence Team will continue to adapt
to meet these evolving challenges.

The Defence mandate is carried out with the support of a group of related organizations and agencies
within the portfolio of the Minister of National Defence. For further details on selected Defence
Portfolio organizations, please refer to Section IV: Other Items of Interest – Selected Defence Portfolio HR

_and Financial Resources. For further information on the legislative framework within which Defence_
operates, please see Section IV: Other Items of Interest – Legislative Environment.

###### Strategic Outcomes and Program Activity Architecture

Within Treasury Board’s Policy on Management, Resources and Results Structures [3 ](MRRS) for planning,
management and reporting, the Program Activity Architecture[4] establishes Defence’s four Strategic
Outcomes.

Each Strategic Outcome is supported by a group of program activities, which, in turn, are aligned to
relevant Defence Priorities, Corporate Risks, and a Government of Canada Outcome Area. For further
information, please refer to _Section IV: Other Items of Interest – Departmental Link to Government of_
_Canada Outcome Areas._

###### The Canada First Defence Strategy

To help Defence carry out our roles and responsibilities, the _Canada First Defence Strategy[5] (CFDS),_
released in May 2008, seeks to ensure a first‐class, modern military that is well‐trained, well‐equipped
and ready to take on the challenges of the 21st century.
To accomplish this, the CFDS provided a 20‐year roadmap to modernize the CF in our environment of


stable and predictable funding that permitted long‐term planning and investment in four Defence
capability areas or pillars:
Personnel: Expand the CF to a total strength of
100,000 (Regular 70,000/Reserve 30,000) by fiscal
year 2027‐28;

Equipment: Renew the CF’s core equipment
platforms;

Readiness: Maximize personnel training and
equipment availability; and

Infrastructure: Replace or refurbish approximately
25 per cent of DND infrastructure holdings within
10 years, with approximately 50 per cent being
replaced or refurbished over 20 years to meet
Canada’s future defence and security requirements.

The CFDS articulates the broad strategic vision for Defence aligned with the level of ambition identified
by the Government of Canada and outlines six core CF missions in domestic, continental and
international contexts:

Conduct daily domestic and continental operations, including in the Arctic and through the
North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD);

Support a major international event in Canada such as the G8, G20 and North American Leaders’
Summits;

Respond to a major terrorist attack;

Support civilian authorities during a crisis in Canada such as a natural disaster;

Lead and/or conduct a major international operation for an extended period; and

Deploy forces in response to crises elsewhere in the world for shorter periods.
This year will mark the opportunity for a cyclical review of the CFDS itself in order to continue the
modernization of the CF in a fiscally sustainable manner.

###### Risk Analysis

Security is influenced by a wide range of factors, domestic and international, that impact on how
Defence carries out its mandate. These factors present us with both risks and opportunities, which are
taken into account as we deliver on our roles and responsibilities. By continuously monitoring emerging
issues, developments and trends we can anticipate and respond to challenges and the risks associated
with them.

The DND/CF Corporate Risk Profile (CRP) documents the risks facing Defence, and is an important
influence on planning and resource allocation decisions. It is a tool through which the executive
leadership can provide guidance and direction in responding to the Corporate Risks assessed as vital to
the achievement of the Defence mission.

The CRP is derived from the review of external and internal risks. For FY 2012‐13, three key Corporate
Risks having a Defence‐wide impact are highlighted. These are Defence Team Capacity Issues, Canadian

|Key Corporate Risks|Col2|
|---|---|
|Risk|Action|
|Canadian Forces Reconstitution|The Canadian Forces (CF), after several years of high tempo operations centred on Afghanistan, will continue to balance the readiness levels necessary to maintain its leadership role and responsiveness in accordance with the Canada First Defence Strategy (CFDS). To mitigate this risk, a directive has been issued for future CF Posture and Defence Readiness, which provides a clear and viable plan to develop and maintain the capabilities and readiness levels necessary to meet the requirements of the CFDS.|
|Defence Team Capacity|Defence will continue to place priority on achieving the right balance and composition of the Defence workforce with focused attention on addressing military and civilian occupations of concern, and on leadership and professional development at all levels in the organization. This will be achieved by continuing to strengthen leadership capacity, succession planning, continuous learning and professional development. Defence will also continue to implement the Public Service Renewal action plan aligned with the Clerk’s priorities as well as advance CF Transformation. This has been supplemented with a directive on recruitment and staffing, and succession planning for civilian staff. All Groups and Commands within National Defence have begun using these directives in their annual business plans.|
|Investment Plan Flexibility|Defence will continue to ensure that there is sufficient flexibility in the IP to address both emerging operational requirements and CF capability requirements of the future as outlined in the CFDS. In support of this, Defence is implementing the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) model and is developing an update to the Investment Plan. These two initiatives will allow Defence to more effectively manage the changes to the Investment Plan (IP) and balance investments across the four pillars of CFDS.|



Forces Reconstitution, and Investment Plan (IP) Flexibility. The key Corporate Risks, as well as their
attendant mitigation actions, are presented below. To fulfill the Government of Canada's expectations,
Defence will continue to manage these Corporate Risks in an effective manner.

In support of this, Defence is implementing the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) model and is
developing an update to the Investment Plan. These two initiatives will allow Defence to more
effectively manage the changes to the Investment Plan (IP) and balance investments across the
four pillars of CFDS.

In an effort to increase the visibility of the CRP in this report, Defence has developed a Defence Priorities
‐ CRP ‐ PAA Alignment Matrix[6], which illustrates the risks related to each Program Activity. See Section II:
_Analysis of Program Activities by Strategic Outcome for discussion of risks and associated mitigation_
strategies.

###### Organizational Priorities

The Defence Priorities are informed by Government and senior leadership direction and from the key
Corporate Risks. They represent a focused number of areas where efforts and resources will be directed
to mitigate the risk areas, and to address gaps in capability or capacity, to enable Defence to act
effectively on Government of Canada direction. To respond with essential activities while achieving

###### Planning Summary

During FY 2012‐13, the CF will maintain the capability to conduct a range of missions at home and
abroad, in collaboration with our whole‐of‐government and international partners. The CF will continue
to lend a helping hand to Canadians in need, as they did following the First Air crash in the North in
2011, the flooding in Manitoba and Quebec, and the fires in Saskatchewan and Northern Ontario.

|2012–13|2013–14|2014–15|

|95,100|94,100|93,496|


Defence will also continue to support multinational drug interdiction operations in the Caribbean and
East Pacific to help to disrupt the flow of illicit drugs to Canadian communities, and will continue to
assist in endeavours such as dealing with illegal immigration.

The CF will continue to make a significant contribution to international security as they have been doing
in Afghanistan. For example, through Operation ATTENTION, and in Canada’s participation in the NATO
Training Mission‐Afghanistan (NTM‐A), the CF is delivering training and professional development
services to the national security forces of Afghanistan, including the Afghan National Army and the
Afghan National Police. The Canadian effort is concentrated in Kabul and Mazar‐e‐Sharif. CF members
will fill command and training development positions and deliver training in areas such as leadership,
health care, literacy improvement, and the core professional skills of soldiers and police.

The CF is having an impact elsewhere in the region as well. Canada is contributing to the Middle East
Peace Process by supporting the US Security Coordinator (USSC) efforts to build Palestinian security
capacity with Op PROTEUS. The CF expertise, flexibility and unique access to the West Bank is key to the
USSC's mission. Op PROTEUS focuses on security sector reforms of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and
among many projects has helped the USSC to create, equip and train 10 Special Battalions of 500
personnel each within the PA's National Security Force that provides the nucleus of security in West
Bank Governorates.

As evidenced by our participation in the NATO‐led operation in Libya, OP MOBILE, the CF has also
demonstrated a high level of readiness to deploy elsewhere around the world if requested to do so by
the Government of Canada. Defence will ensure that forces are ready to deploy to similar international
operations in the future when requested by the Government of Canada.
Defence will continue the modernization of the CF by advancing numerous key projects while seeking
new efficiencies. In FY 2012‐13, Defence will:

-  Re‐evaluate the Investment Plan to balance Canada First Defence Strategy requirements;

-  Streamline the procurement process and relationships with other government departments (OGD)
including Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC); and

-  Support other government departments (OGD) in the implementation of the National Shipbuilding
Procurement Strategy (NSPS).

Through these and other activities, Defence will meet the expectations of the Government of Canada
and Canadians.

###### Contribution to the Federal Sustainable Development Strategy

The Federal Sustainable Development Strategy (FSDS) outlines the Government of Canada’s
commitment to improving the transparency of environmental decision‐making by articulating its key
strategic environmental goals and targets. Defence ensures that consideration of these outcomes is an
integral part of its decision‐making processes. In particular, through the federal Strategic Environmental
Assessment (SEA) process, any new policy, plan, or program initiative includes an analysis of its impact
on attaining the FSDS goals and targets. The results of SEAs are made public when an initiative is
announced, demonstrating the department’s commitment to achieving the FSDS goals and targets.

Defence contributes to Theme IV ‐ Shrinking the Environmental Footprint – Beginning with Government,
as denoted by the visual identifier below.

These contributions are components of the following Program Activities and are further explained in
_Section II: Analysis of Program Activities by Strategic Outcome:_

_Equipment Acquisition and Disposal;_

_Real Property and Informatics Infrastructure Acquisition and Disposal;_

_Environment Protection and Stewardship; and_

_Internal Services._

A Defence Environmental Strategy (DES) will also be implemented to reflect the breadth of effort that
Defence commits to the environment and sustainable development, including Defence’s significant
contribution to the Government of Canada’s Federal Sustainable Development Strategy. Operational
themes within the DES will be aligned with the program activities of the Department’s Program Activity
Architecture to demonstrate their relevance toward achieving the strategic outcomes that support the
_Canada First Defence Strategy._

For additional details on Defence’s activities to support sustainable development please see Section II of
this RPP and http://www.vcds‐vcemd.forces.gc.ca/sites/page‐eng.asp?page=5609. For complete details
on the FSDS please see http://www.ec.gc.ca/dd‐sd/.

###### Strategic Outcome: Defence operations improve peace, stability and security wherever deployed

Defence fulfills three roles for Canadians: defending Canada, defending North America, and contributing
to international peace, stability and security. This outcome outlines these Defence roles in the context
of the expected level of ambition as articulated in the Canada First Defence Strategy (CFDS).

###### Program Activity[7]: Situational Awareness

_The Government of Canada and Defence require an accurate and timely security picture and comprehensive_
_situational awareness and threat knowledge for Canada and abroad. This program will provide credible,_
_reliable and sustained intelligence services to Defence in support of decision making and military operations,_
_as well as, support to other government departments in the defence and security of Canada. Work activities_
_include geospatial intelligence, imagery intelligence, signals intelligence, and counter intelligence. The_
_program also ensures the acquisition and use of information from the global information infrastructure to_
_provide foreign intelligence to support Government of Canada intelligence priorities. This is accomplished_
_through the collection, dissemination and analysis of electronic information. The program will ensure the_
_provision of advice, guidance and services to help protect electronic information and information_
_infrastructures of importance to the Government of Canada as well as technical and operational assistance to_
_federal law enforcement and security agencies in the performance of their lawful duties._

**Planning Highlights**

**Defence Priority advanced by this Program Activity:**

_Ensuring Sustainable Operational Excellence both at Home and Abroad_

In order to enhance situational awareness, Defence will continue to improve the integration and
synchronization of the all‐domain awareness for Canada and the approaches;

Defence intelligence will continue to foster closer ties with its international allies and domestic
partners to build on existing information and technology sharing efforts;

Defence intelligence will support both the Government of Canada and Ministerial intelligence
priorities, building on the existing cohesive efforts of the intelligence community; and

Supporting its Military Diplomacy activity, Defence will re‐balance its deployment of Defence
Attachés to maximize the Department’s ability to engage with key global partners.

**Corporate Risks associated with this program activity, with accompanying mitigation strategies:**

_Secure and Integrated Information Management (IM)/Information Technology (IT)_

Our information and intelligence system is completely reliant on a secure and integrated network of
IM/IT tools. There are high expectations from Allies with respect to our ability to assure the security
of shared information. Defence is advancing programme activities (e.g. Canadian Cryptographic
Modernization Programme) specifically designed to mitigate this risk.

_Defence Security_

There is a risk that potential threats cannot be monitored by conventional means, particularly in

emerging domains like cyber. In order to further mitigate this, Defence will seek to enhance its ability
to defend Canada and to exploit information to identify threats in emerging warfare domains.


-----

###### Program Activity: Canadian Peace, Stability and Security

_This program employs the Canadian Forces in the conduct of operations to ensure the safety and security of_
_Canadians and the defence of Canada. These operations include protecting Canada’s sovereignty, responding_
_to domestic disasters or humanitarian crisis, supporting domestic security requirements, and conducting search_
_and rescue activities. This is accomplished through the mobilization and deployment of forces within Canada._

**Planning Highlights**

**Defence Priority advanced by this Program Activity:**

_Strengthening the Defence Team_

The long‐term objectives of Regular and Reserve Force personnel have been met and will be
maintained, with the Regular Force at 68,000 Total Strength and the Reserve Force at an annual
average paid strength of 27,000;


-----

Defence will maintain the Regular Force by:

-  Maintaining the current CF strength at 68,000 (+/‐ 500);

-  Bringing the size of the Trained Effective Strength (TES) closer to the size of the Trained Effective
Establishment (TEE) by continuing to reduce the Basic Training List (BTL);

-  Reducing the number of distressed occupations; and

-  Reducing the number of over‐strength occupations.

To ensure Defence has the skilled, competent and sustainable civilian workforce it needs, investment
in renewing the workforce will be targeted to support critical organizational and operational
objectives, including:

-  Research to identify under‐strength occupations in order to maintain civilian capacity to fill
mission critical roles;

-  Continuation of the Apprenticeship and Operational Development Program, a comprehensive
strategy for attracting, retaining and managing general labour and trades talent; and

-  Continued implementation of stressed occupation development programs (purchasing, finance,
engineering, and computing), which include staffing tools and systems to manage those
specialized areas where skills shortages are an issue.

Defence PA will ensure CF recruitment activities are supported with comprehensive and targeted
recruitment advertising initiatives.

**Corporate Risk associated with this program activity, with accompanying mitigation strategies:**

_Defence Team Capacity (Key Risk)_

Defence will advance a comprehensive plan to align and optimize the military and civilian workforce
with CFDS requirements;

Defence will maximize military and civilian potential by continuing to strengthen leadership capacity,
succession planning, continuous learning and professional development;

Defence will continue to implement the Public Service Renewal action plan aligned with the Clerk’s
priorities; and

Defence will advance CF Transformation.

For a full listing of the Program Activity Descriptions, please see the 2012‐13 Main estimates (http://www.tbs‐sct.gc.ca/est‐

pre/20122013/p2‐eng.asp)
8
Littoral: In military operations, a coastal region consisting of the coastal sea areas and that portion of the land that is
susceptible to influence or support from the sea.
9 Although informatics is included in the definition of the program activity, it is not reported under this program activity.
Conversely, maintenance and repair informs the readiness of our forces and is reported here.
10 Notes on Human Resources Summary (Full‐Time Equivalent) reported in Section IV:

-  Military personnel size is measured by total strength and includes Vote 5 funded personnel and approximately 1,100
members on leave without pay (80% related to parental leave).

-  Primary Reserve Class C figures are reported separately to maintain the visibility of reservists employed full‐time in support
of deployed/contingency operations.

-  For reporting purposes, Primary Reserve Class C are considered equivalent to the Regular Force personnel as they are
entitled to equivalent pay, benefits and liability as a Regular Force member.

-  Primary Reserve Class C is calculated as person year. For example, two Primary Reservists on Class C service for six months
would count as one military FTE.

-  Civilian workforce is planned through a salary wage envelope (SWE). For reporting purposes, the civilian workforce is
measured by FTEs. The FTE total includes all personnel tenure (indeterminate, term, casual and student employees) actively
employed and calculated as person year. For example, two part‐time employees sharing one position would count as one
FTE.

-  Civilian workforce planned FTEs are subject to final budgetary approval.

-  Civilian FTEs include approximately 950 Vote 5 funded personnel. Civilian FTEs do not include personnel on leave without
pay.

-  FTE figures in this RPP are not consistent 1:1 with the FTE figures used for the allocation of the financial resources approved
for the 2011‐12 Annual Reference Level Update (ARLU).

-  Planned FTE figures are based on planned establishment numbers.
11 Notes on Human Resources Summary (Reserve Force Personnel) reported in Section IV:

-  The Primary Reserve are those personnel working in various capacities with the CF where Class A reservists perform part‐
time work and training, Class B reservists are employed full‐time or perform full‐time training for more than 14 consecutive
days, and Class C reservists are employed full‐time but with the equivalent pay, benefits and liability as a Regular Force
member.

-  The majority of Reservists serve on part‐time (Class A) service. There is a significant reduction in Class A numbers during the
summer as many personnel are away from their home units conducting training on short‐term Class B status. In addition,
some Primary Reserve members are inactive. For these reasons, total strength is not an accurate representation of those on
duty. The portion of Primary Reserve that is on duty and receives payment is counted and reported as the Primary Reserve
average paid strength (an annual monthly average).

-  Primary Reserve average paid strength reporting, planning and allocations are based on monthly reports provided by
Assistant Deputy Minister (Finance and Corporate Services)/Director Strategic Finance Costing and Assistant Deputy
Minister (Information Management)/Director Human Resource Information Management (DHRIM).

-  Canada First Defence Strategy calls for the Reserve Force expansion to 27,000 (average paid strength) by fiscal year
2011‐12.

-  Canadian Ranger planned expansion is 5,000 by fiscal year 2011‐12.

-  Further information on Primary Reserve Planned Expenditures can be found in Section IV: Other Items of Interest – Reserve
_Force._
12 DRDC is not considered as a Portfolio Organization but rather a "Special Operating Agency" which reports and is accountable
to the Deputy Minister for performance of the Agency.
