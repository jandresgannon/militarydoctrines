**CHAPTER 1: GREECE IN THE NEW ERA**

**1. THE GEOSTRATEGIC POSITION OF GREECE**

Geography and history have placed Greece at a critical geopolitical area, amid Europe, Asia
and Africa. Greece, situated at a crossroads between East and West, North and South, in the
Eastern Mediterranean, a sea area of enormous strategic and economic importance, occupies a
critical geographic position, as it is surrounded by hot spots of tension and conflicts.

The distinctive geographic formation of the Hellenic territory, which comprises the mainland mainly mountainous, with an extended coastline and countless natural harbours and bays, as
well as a great number of islands and islets dispersed all over the Hellenic seas (3,012 islands
and rocky islets and over 15,000 kms of coastline), lends Greece an exceptional geostrategic
character, rendering it as the Europe's gate to Asia and Africa. The double grounding of the
Hellenic State reflects the continuous historic Hellenic presence in this particular geographic
area, which also consists the cradle of the Hellenic nation and civilization. Furthermore, the
unity of the mainland and the insular complex reflects the distinct geostrategic importance of
the Hellenic territory, but as well as the special security requirements of Greece.

From a geostrategic point of view, the Aegean Sea with its Hellenic insular complex,
exercises control over the sea lines of communication from and to the Black Sea. From the
point of view of national security, the Hellenic mainland and the insular complex form an
integrated defence area, as it provides, according to the direction of the threat, the required
strategic depth which serves the security needs of Greece. The existence of international
waters within the Aegean Sea creates specific security requirements for national defence
which render the ensuring of unhindered air and sea communications between the mainland
and insular Greece of vital importance.

The island of Crete, with its naval and air facilities as well as its central position in the eastern
Mediterranean basin, offers itself as an exceptional base for air and naval operations to all
directions (perimetrically), as well as for the control of the sea and air lines of communication
to and from the Eastern Mediterranean Sea and the Middle East.

**2. THE NEW INTERNATIONAL ORDER**

The wide-ranging changes of the past few years, especially the end of the Cold War and the
collapse of the Soviet Union, led to the transformation of the international political system.
mankind got rid of, at least temporarily, the horror of a nuclear holocaust. however, new risks
appeared replacing the old ones. The international security system is in a state of flux. The old
interrelations were not replaced by a new world order, but by a general confusion.

Fluctuation, instability and insecurity, both in the European system and the international
political setting, were caused by the changes in the status quo, in 1989. Nationalist aspirations
appearing all over Europe, especially in the Balkans, further intensify the regional and
international security problems. The general picture of insecurity and instability is


-----

complemented by the appearance of a series of new risks and challenges in the Mediterranean
and the Middle East.

[(see map 1)](http://www.resdal.org.ar/Archivo/gre-cap1-2_1.htm)

[(see map 2)](http://www.resdal.org.ar/Archivo/gre-cap1-2_2.htm)

The time has come for a world of stability and cooperation, for a common security system
embracing all Europe, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Urals. Approaching the threshold of the
21st century, we need to redefine the relations and cooperation structures of the European
countries in regard to security matters, in order to successfully address issues concerning:

o the internal adaptation of NATO (new command structure)

o the external adaptation of the Alliance

o the evolving relationship with Russia, Ukraine and the other countries of the
Partnership for Peace (PfP) Programme

o the Western European Unions (WEU) role

o the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) new role.

Today, the most important developments in security matters in Europe are based on the fact
that NATO changes, adapts to the new situation, adopts a new strategy, reorganises its
command system and changes the structure of forces within the Alliance, creating
multinational rapid reaction forces in order to improve its collective defence capability and its
participation in crises management.

NATO, confronting the challenges of the new post-cold war international system, is moving
forward with radical restructuring of its strategic goals, structures and operation. It aims to
transform from a collective defence (military) organisation to a political, diplomatic and, at
the same time, military organisation, mainly concerned with peace keeping in a wide
geographic area, beyond the traditional region of responsibility of the Alliance. NATO
generally promotes stability in Europe through the Euro Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC)
and the Partnership for Peace Programme (PfP).

Greece believes that the new Atlantic Treaty with its multiple capabilities and roles, aiming at
gradually including all countries of Central and Eastern Europe, will constitute the guarantor
for peace in the Balkans as well as in Europe, being the only reliable politico-military
organization, able to fill the "security vacuum" created in the area by the collapse of the
bipolar system. Based on this perspective, our country participates actively in all the
procedures regarding NATO's transformation, the keystones being the development of a
European Security and Defence Identity (ESDI), the establishment of an organisational
structure for the implementation of the "Combined Joint Task Force" (CJTF) concept, the
establishment of new headquarters and regional commands, as well as the promotion of PfP
Programmes and the regional cooperation in the context of the EAPC, in a way that the
existing regional balances are not upset by the structural reorganisation of the Alliance. Our
country, persuaded that NATO's evolution serves security and peace in its wider area, aspires
to become a "bridge" for the Southeast European countries, aiming at their smooth integration
into the defensive system of the Alliance.

The new strategic goals of the North-Atlantic Treaty, concerning both its external and internal
adaptation, were included in the Declaration of Madrid, that was adopted at the Summit


-----

Meeting of the leaders of NATO member-states on July 8-9, 1997. The basic principles of this
declaration are as follows :
MADRID DECLARATION
ON EURO-ATLANTIC SECURITY AND CO-OPERATION (JULY 8, 1997)

o We, the heads of NATO member-countries, have come together in Madrid in
order to give shape to the new structure of the Alliance, as we move towards
the 21st century.

o The North-Atlantic Alliance will be the driving force in the process of the
emergence of a new Europe with greater cohesion and co-operation.

o We move towards the realisation of the vision of a just and lasting order of
peace for Europe as a whole, based on human rights, freedom and democracy.

o While maintaining our core function of collective defence, we have adapted
our political and military structures to improve our ability to meet new
challenges of regional crises and conflict management.

o The Alliance will remain open to new members accession, under article 10 of
the North-Atlantic Treaty. Today, we invite Hungary and Poland to begin
accession talks. Our goal is to sign a relevant Protocol of Accession at the time
of the Ministerial meetings, in December 1997, and conclude the ratification
progress by the 50th anniversary of the Washington Treaty, in April 1999.

o Countries, which have previously expressed an interest in becoming NATO
members, but were not invited to begin accession talks today, will remain
under consideration for future membership. No European democratic country,
whose admission would fulfil the objectives of the Treaty, will be excluded
from the possibility of accession in the Alliance. As far as the future aspirants
are concerned, we recognise and take into account the positive developments
towards democracy and the rule of law in a number of south-eastern European
countries, and especially in Romania and Slovenia. In 1999, we will review the
expansion process.

o We adopt the decision taken in Sintra, concerning encouragement of the
Partnership for Peace (PfP), strengthening, at the same time, the political
dialogue and augmenting the role of the partners in decision making and
planning for PfP.

o Through the new forum, that has been established, the NATO-Russia
Permanent Joint Council, the two sides will consult, co-operate and, where
appropriate, act together to address challenges to security in Europe.

o The Mediterranean region merits greater attention and emphasis, since the
European security is closely connected with security and stability in the
Mediterranean. We endorse the decision of establishing a new committee, the
Mediterranean Co-operation Group, that under the aegis of the North-Atlantic
Council, will have the overall responsibility for the Mediterranean Dialogue.

o We welcome the progress achieved concerning the Alliance's internal
adaptation. Its fundamental objectives are to maintain the Alliance's military
effectiveness and its capability to react to a wide range of contingencies, to
preserve the transatlantic link and to develop the European Security and
Defence Identity (ESDI), by assigning NATO forces for operations of the
Western European Union (WEU).

o The members of the Alliance welcomed Spain's announcement to fully
participate in NATO's military section.

o We continue to attach utmost importance to the CFE Treaty.


-----

o We reaffirm the importance of arrangements in the Alliance for consultation,
on threats of a wider nature, including those against the security interests of
NATO, as well as those linked to illegal arms trade and acts of terrorism.

At the same time, the Western European Union (WEU) is strengthened, whereas, the
procedures are promoted in order to allow it become the defence branch of the European
Union.

Greece participates in efforts to build up a European defence identity in the framework of the
WEU, playing a positive role towards a gradual reorganisation of the WEU with its own
strategy and objectives. Greece, at the same time, favours the maintenance of links between
the WEU and NATO. To this end, it supports the designation of a framework of agreement
concerning mutual support of these two organisations, in their perspective to maintain
independence and the ability to decide and act independently, whenever required.

As far as the European Armaments Programme is concerned, Greece favours the
establishment of an institutional body that will take over the co-ordination of the policy of the
European countries in this area. Europe in the framework of the Maastricht treaties widens the
concepts of defence and security from a national to a European level. The armaments
programmes are common, so are the modernisation, support, and maintenance programmes.
Common procedures for systems acquisition are examined covering all stages of the
procurement cycle, from recognition of the requirement and determination of operational
characteristics, to the implementation and provision of support, as well as a common exports
policy.

Greece, due to its geopolitical position, has to maintain, at least until the establishment of a
common European foreign affairs and defence policy, the status of national security and
independence in critical armaments programmes. However, Greece actively participates in
common programmes of research and technology, aiming at the development of cooperation
among the European countries, as well as at the strengthening and modernisation of the
European defensive technological infrastructure, so that the future requirements of the Armed
Forces of the EU member-states can be met.

**3. THE ROLE OF GREECE IN THE BALKANS AND THE EASTERN**
**MEDITERRANEAN**

Both challenges and opportunities emerge for Greek national security due to developments in
the Balkans and the Eastern Mediterranean.

The challenges stem from the continuing fluctuation and instability at the triangle
encompassing the Balkans, the Middle East and the Caucasus and from the strenuous
international antagonism of the industrial countries in order to secure access to the natural
resources of Central Asia.

On the other hand, the post-cold war international setting offers important possibilities of
strengthening Greek security in relation to the central geopolitical position of Greece but also
to the shift of the basic orientation of international politics from the relations between East

-----

West to the relations between North-South. The focus of the international political system has
shifted from Central Europe and the out-of-date conflict between east-West, to the perimeter
of the European continent and especially to the Mediterranean and the Middle East.

Greece and Cyprus consist critical factors in the formation of a stable regional security
system. Within the next few years, our country can take advantage of its unique strategic
position, in order to become a stabilizing factor in the areas of the Balkans, the Black Sea and
the Eastern Mediterranean as well as a vital link of those areas with Europe.

In the Balkan setting, the elements of economic uncertainty and political instability, as well as
the problems caused by changes in the established order are still dominant factors and it will
take a long time to be overcome. Greece's objective is to contribute to the establishment of
conditions of stability and peace in the broader area that will allow us to play an active role in
the overall development of the Balkan peninsula.

Greece, the only member of the European Union (EU), NATO and the Western European
Union (WEU) in the area of the Balkans and the Eastern Mediterranean, is both capable and
willing to play a stabilizing role in the wider area. Through a series of bilateral defence
cooperation and confidence building measures (CBMs) agreements with Balkan and other
countries as well as with the promotion of PfP programmes and regional cooperation
initiatives in the framework of EAPC, Greece makes an effort to contribute to the reduction of
tension in the area, to the cut down of arms build ups and to the establishment of security and
cooperation structures.

Greece promotes a series of political initiatives aiming at improving bilateral relations with its
northern neighbours and promoting security and stability in the area.

[(see map1)](http://www.resdal.org.ar/Archivo/gre-cap1-3_1.htm)

Greece is unfortunately obliged to confront the challenges of a changing international
environment, and at the same time, to face Turkey's policy against Greece and Cyprus.

The revisionist policy of Turkey towards Greece, as demonstrated in the Aegean, Cyprus, and
Thrace, causes serious concern and is considered as the most significant threat against Greek
security.

By disputing the legal sovereign rights of Greece, by violating its national territory, -almost
on a daily basis- and by twisting the international law principles, Turkey aims at convincing
the international community that there are serious differences between the two countries, with
the aim of changing, through negotiations, the status quo in the area to Greece's disadvantage.
Among Turkey's ambitions are the extension of its operational responsibility boundaries in the
Aegean, within the NATO framework, the extension of its FIR westwards, the extension of
the research and rescue boundaries, the changing of the territorial status quo in areas of the
Aegean (a first step is the attempt to create "grey" zones) and the co-exploitation of the
Continental Shelf. At the same time, it openly threatens Greece with war in case the latter
decides to exercise its legal right (according to article 3 of the new Law of the Sea) to extend
its territorial waters from 6 to 12 nautical miles. Turkey is clearly escalating a tension strategy,
as shown by its provocations and claims concerning the Imia rock islets that brought the two
countries on the brink of war, the unprecedented challenge of the Hellenic sovereignty of
Gavdos (which Turkey was forced to withdraw because of Greek and international reactions)


-----

and of other islets and islands as well as the cold-blooded murders of civilians in Cyprus, in
August 1996.

**CHAPTER 2: THE STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK OF NATIONAL DEFENCE**

**1. THE NATIONAL STRATEGY**

Greek national strategy includes the following fundamental principles:

o The deterrence of any external threat.

o The support of the country's European course.

o The support of the country's position in the Balkans with a view to its
gradually becoming European Union' s Balkan gateway.

o The active presence of Greece in the area of the Black Sea and the Eastern
Mediterranean.

o The development of an active and dynamic defence diplomacy aiming at
promoting civil security, peace, and cooperation in the area of the Balkans, the
Black Sea, and the Eastern Mediterranean.

o Active participation in all international organisations.

o The presence of Greece as the metropolitan centre of Hellenism, that takes the
necessary initiatives to mobilise the Hellenes around the world.

**2. THE NATIONAL DEFENCE POLICY**

The general aim of the national defence policy is the strengthening of Greece's security,
through combined actions in the area of defence diplomacy and foreign policy, and its
constructive role as a driving force for stability in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Balkans.

**The principles of the national defence policy are:**

a. Abiding by the international treaties and agreements, the principles of the Charter of the
United Nations and the Final Act of Helsinki, according to which:

o Greece considers its borders, as well as the exercise of its legal sovereignty
rights, to be firmly defined and aspires to the respect of status quo in the
region, as this has ensued from the international treaties and agreements which
Greece has signed.

o It remains firm in matters concerning its national security and sovereignty.

o It considers the survival of the Cypriot Hellenism, and the guarantee of its
security to be a national duty and a vital interest.

b. Attachment to peace, stability, and the principles of international law.

c. Peaceful resolution of disputes and deterrence of threats against national security through
political, diplomatic, economic, and military means.

d. Respect of international obligations that arise from the Conventional Forces in Europe
(CFE) Treaty, the Open Skies Treaty and other relevant agreements.

e. Prevention from acquisition and use of weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, chemical,


-----

biological) and support of international efforts for the reduction of their proliferation.

**Aims of the national defence policy are:**

a. Keeping the peace, safeguarding the country' s territorial integrity, protecting the national
independence, sovereignty and security of Greek people from any attack or threat from
abroad.

b. Guarantee of the Cypriot Hellenism's security and concern about the Hellenic minorities'
security abroad.

c. Acquiring, according to priority, the necessary means for national defence, so that the
exercise of national sovereignty on land, sea and air is effectively supported.

d. Ensuring the capability to perform land, sea and air transportation.

e. Existence of stability in the region, resolution of peripheral conflicts and preservation of
military balance.

f. Promotion of friendship and good neighbourhood relations, as well as of cooperation in the
zone of our geopolitical interest in Europe, the Balkans, the Black Sea, the Eastern
Mediterranean, the Middle East, and North Africa.

g. Maximisation of the advantages from Greece's participation in alliances and collective
security organisations (NATO, WEU, OSCE, EU) for the protection of its national interests,
honoring at the same time, the country's obligations towards them.

h. Contribution to the development of the national economy, especially through the
development of the domestic defence industry and the materialisation of armament
programmes and research on defence issues.

i. Reinforcement of security conditions for the citizens with the contribution of the Armed
Forces when facing disasters, major calamities, and, in general, civil emergencies, especially
in the frontier areas, as well as reinforcement of the unity and solidarity between the people
and the army, thus promoting the social role of the Armed Forces.

**3. THE NATIONAL MILITARY STRATEGY**

In the framework of the national defence policy, as defined by the Governmental Council on
Foreign Affairs and National Defence, the Ministry of National Defence formulates the
national military strategy which provides the directives for the use of the country' s military
power, the development of defence planning, the planning of the structure of the forces, as
well as the procedures for decision-making in defence matters.
_The national military strategy is a part of our national strategy, which aims at strengthening_
_the position of Greece both in our region, and in the broader international area._

The central axis of Greece's military strategy is the deterrence of the Turkish threat as well as
of the dangers and risks sremming from other directions, in combination with the policy of


-----

relaxing the tensions. The country' s military doctrine is defensive. Greece aims to increase
the operational ability of the Hellenic Armed Forces in order to achieve an effective deterrent
policy, which should be constant, undiminishing, and convincing, and have the following
elements:

o credibility

o declaration of the country's intention that it will react if challenged

o capability to respond to an attack.

As a result, Greece's national strategy consists of three elements: "defensive sufficiency",
"flexible response" and the country's ability to effectively cover the "Greece-Cyprus Joint
Defence Area".

**Defence Sufficiency**

The "defence sufficiency" policy provides an alternative to the arms race between Greece and
Turkey and sets as a target the securing of all those defensive means, as well as the quality of
manpower, which constitute the necessary and sufficient conditions for the deterrence of any
threat. At the same time, it means a systematic effort for the introduction of new technology
and weapon systems that ensure the maximisation of "cost-effectiveness".

**Flexible Response**

According to the defence policy principles, Greece's reaction to any challenge should be
appropriate, selective, prompt, and effective. The defence preparation of the Armed Forces
must ensure a large variety, both with regard to the selection of forces for employment of
limited potential and reliable deterrent ability, and with regard to the accomplishment of a
variety of foreign and defence policy objectives that may become relevant to an escalation of
a crisis in the Aegean.

**Joint Defence Area**

In 1993, Greece and Cyprus decided to establish a Joint Defence Area in order to deter the
Turkish threat. The initiative in progress assumes a clear defensive character and aims at
preventing or addressing any offensive actions against the participating parties.

**4. THE NEW STRUCTURE OF THE ARMED FORCES**

In order to create effective armed forces, suitable to meet the principles of the country' s
defence policy, Greece should:

a. Develop, on land, flexible, mobile, and effective forces, with armour protection, great fire
power and effectiveness, properly organised and deployed, capable of securing the integrity of
mainland and insular Greece and contributing to the defence of Cyprus.

b. Develop, on sea, a naval force, capable of protecting Greece's sovereign rights, defending
the Hellenic shores and islands from sea attacks, keeping the sea lines of communication


-----

open, and projecting power ashore.

c. Develop, on air, an air force capable of protecting Greece's sovereign rights, and ensuring
the country' s air-defence.

d. Maximise the capability of coordinated action among the services of the armed forces, so as
to be able to conduct combined operations in order to achieve the objectives of the country's
defence strategy in the direction of development and support of joint operations.

e. Reorganise the forces of the three services, with a view to improving the effectiveness and
reaction time and aiming, at the same time, at reducing their operational cost.

**5. DEFENCE DIPLOMACY**

In the context of the European Union, Greece:

a. Supports any effort for the development of a common defence policy on the part of the
European Union and the development of the WEU as its defence pillar.

b. Actively participates in the developments within the European Union and the WEU and
pursues a substantial role in the decision-making and planning levels.

Greece's defence diplomacy in the Balkans is developing on the basis of the preservation of
good relationships, constructive cooperation, and resolution of problems and differences by
peaceful means, aiming at:

a. The bilateral defence cooperation between Greece and Albania on the basis of the respect of
the existing borders and the human rights of the Greek minority.

b. The support of international community's efforts for full implementation of the Paris peace
agreement on Bosnia-Herzegovina.

c. The preservation of friendly relation-ships with FYROM under the condition of eliminating
those issues that conceal irredentist aspirations against Greece.

d. The promotion of close defence cooperation between Greece and the Balkan states, which
can also be extended to joint exercises of the armed forces.

e. The assumption of a substantial role in promoting "Partnership for Peace" activites in the
Balkan region.

f. The preservation of close relationships in the economic, political, and, under certain
conditions, defence sectors with FR Yugoslavia and Bulgaria.

g. Supports Romania and Bulgaria' s accession to NATO.

In Eastern Europe, Greece:


-----

a. Pursues the development of a military co-operation with Russia, the Black Sea and the
Transaucasus states on matters of defence industry, military education and training, and the
transfer of know-how.

b. Develops bilateral defence co-operation with these countries.

In the Middle East and the Mediterranean Greece's defence diplomacy focuses on:

a. The pursuit of defence cooperation with countries of the Middle East and the
Mediterrannean on matters of cadre training, defence industry, and exercises.

b. The promotion and support of initiatives and actions for keeping the peace, establishing
mutual confidence, reducing arms build-ups and promoting co-operation among the countries
of the region.

c. The reinforcement of the Hellenic naval and air presence, especially in the Eastern
Mediterranean.

With regard to NATO, Greece's defence diplomacy specialises in the following actions:

a. Active participation in the activities, exercises, and the decision-making mechanisms of the
Alliance.

b. Supports NATO' s evolution to a "common security" organisation, as well as its
enlargement given that no overturning will take place and that the existing configuration of
power that guarantees the stability and peace in the different areas of the Alliance especially
in its South eastern region, will be further reinforced.

c. Support the establishment of NATO headquarters on Greek territory, in connection with the
various NATO decisions concerning the development of a new NATO command structure.

As far as Greece's cooperation with the USA is concerned, its defence diplomacy focuses on
the following:

a. Promoting good relations without neglecting its European identity or slowing down defence
cooperation programmes with other countries.

b. Keeping a balance of (military) power between Greece and Turkey.

As far as the U.N. is concerned, Greece supports peace-support and humanitarian aid
operations. It also participates actively in the assembly of forces to serve those objectives.

As far as the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is concerned,
Greece supports its transformation to a conflict-prevention and crisis management
organisation.

**CHAPTER 3: THE CONTRIBUTION OF GREECE TO THE INTERNATIONAL**
**SECURITY**

**1. INTERNATIONAL TREATIES AND AGREEMENTS**

The obligations and rights which derive from Greece's participation in international and
defence organisations (UN, OSCE, NATO, EU, WEU) are integrated in the defence planning.
Thus, the role of Greece as a factor of stability and peace in the sensitive area of SE Europe is
substantially reinforced.

At the same time, the primary goal of compliance with international Law is implemented. For
this purpose, Greece's defence planning includes the treaties and agreements signed by the
country concerning arms control, international regulations for armed conflict (rules of
international humanitarian law), regulations for international shipping and navigation (Treaty
for the International Law of Sea and the Chicago Treaty), regulations and limitations relative
to the control of conventional forces in Europe (CFE Treaty), freedom of over-flight for the
purposes of the "Open Skies" Treaty control of exports and transfer of conventional weapons
(Wassenaar Arrangement), ban on development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical,
biological and toxin weapons and control of missile technology, as well as regulations related
to the implementation of Article V of the Dayton Agreement.

Additionally, the limitations and commitments that our country has undertaken as a result of
ratification of previous treaties concerning the nuclear weapons, especially the ban on placing
nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction on the seabed, the comprehensive nuclear test
Ban treaty (CTBT), the ban on military or any other aggressive use of technical methods of
environmental modification and the ban on the proliferation of nuclear weapons, the ban on
the use of inhumane weapons, as well as the regulations of international humanitarian law
(Geneva Treaties and the attached Protocols) are incorporated in Greece's defence planning.

[(see graphic 1)](http://www.resdal.org.ar/Archivo/gre-cap3-1_1.htm)

**Organisation for security and Co-operation in Europe (osce)**

The organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) constitutes the only forum
on an inter-European level, for addressing security, co-operation and human rights issues,
jointly by all European nations, the USA and Canada. Its aim is to improve the effectiveness
of its political role through the triptych of:

o crisis management,

o conflict prevention,

o peaceful settlement of differences.

On the absence of legal binding, this organisation is based on political obligation for
implementation of its decisions.

o During the period of 1996-1997, Greece provided assistance to the work of
OSCE as well as to the Dayton Agreement participating countries, by sending
assistant escorts to conduct the inspections. In addition, Greece provided
training related to the reduction of conventional weapons and is prepared to
offer further assistance, if required.


-----

On implementing the agreement on armament control in Bosnia-Herzegovina (Articles II and
IV of Dayton Agreement), our country headed the multinational inspection delegation on
24/06/96 in this country.

Besides, within the framework of the Dayton Agreement, OSCE has undertaken total
responsibility for the conduct of elections for governmental agents. The Hellenic Force in BH, which constitutes the main transportation body of IFOR/SFOR, has effectively contributed
to the successful completion of the elections.

**Conventional Forces in Europe (CfE) Treaty**

In the framework of the "Conventional Forces in Europe" (CfE) treaty, which has been signed
by 30 countries and is in force since July 1992, Greece has agreed to reduce its armaments by
November 1995 to the levels shown in the following table:

**MAXIMUM NUMBER**
**OF WEAPON SYSTEMS**
**According to the CfE treaty**

**Category** **CfE Ceiling**

Tanks 1,735

Armoured Vehicles 2,498

Artillery Pieces 1,920

Fighter Aircraft 650

Helicopters
70-100
(for the year 2000)

In order to carry out its obligations, Greece has destroyed, in total, 1,052 tanks, 428 APCs AFVs, 192 artillery pieces and 285 mortars.

In compliance with the terms of the CFE treaty and the resulting CFE 1A act, Greece has
specified the maximum number of Army and Air Force personnel as 158,621 men.
Additionally, in the framework of the CFE treaty, Greece implements the scheduled yearly
transfer of data relative to units and formations of the Army and the Air Force. Greece
receives a number of CFE inspections and at the same time conducts inspections on military
facilities of other signatory countries, in order to verify the declared weapon systems.

**The organs of control, planning and implementation of the Treaty are:**

o The Joint Consultative Group (JCG), a permanent OSCE organ based in
Vienna (All NATO member countries and the other CFE member countries are
represented - 30 countries in total).

o The Verification and Co-ordination Committee (VCC) based in Brussels
(NATO member countries are represented).

The main Treaty provisions are:

_Annual Data Exchange: Greece declares 112 sites (Objects of Verification-OoV), (Army :_
100, Air Force : 12) and their corresponding weapon systems.

|MAXIMUM NUMBER OF WEAPON SYSTEMS According to the CfE treaty|Col2|

-----

_Inspections: With the aim of verifying the declared data through a system of active and_
passive inspections, Greece receives and conduct verification inspections.

_Implementation agents: within the member countries are usually the Verification Centers. In_
Greece, the corresponding responsibility has been assigned to HAGS's Arms Reduction
Control Division (ARCD), to Directorate A3/4 of HAGS and to the CFE Directorate of the
National Intelligence Service (NIS). MoD Staff and HNDGS' ARCD are responsible for the
co-ordination, planning and monitoring of the developments.

**2. INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS**

During 1996 and 1997 and with the aim of promoting Greece's bilateral relations, supporting
the country's national interests and exercising a rigorous defence diplomacy, the Hellenic
Minister of Defence, the Deputy Minister as well as HNDGS staff officers visited several
countries in the Balkans, the Mediterranean Basin, and in Western and Eastern Europe.

In addition, a substantial number of visits by Ministers, Deputy Minister and Chiefs of Staffs
from Balkan, Mediterranean, EU and Central and East European countries, as well as of visits
by representatives from international organisations, has taken place within the same period of
time.

**3. HELLENIC PEACE - SUPPORT MISSIONS**


-----

In the framework of UN activities, our country participates in peace-support missions with the
assignment of cadres from all three services of the Armed Forces.

Basic requirement for the hellenic participation in peace-support operations is the observance
of certain principles, such as, the existence of a mandate prior to the formation of the force,
specified chain of command and control structure, size of the force, specific rules of
engagement and operational concept as well as acceptance of the national composition of
units from all the opposing parts.

Our country participates in the UN readiness system for peace-support operations, by forming
the Hellenic Peace-support Mission Unit (HPMU). The manning of this unit will be effected
on a voluntary basis.

The Hellenic Armed Forces, in solidarity with other countries, currently participate in two
peace-support missions, in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Albania.

The Hellenic Force in Bosnia (HFB), consisting of 280 men and 136 vehicles, deployed in
Bosnia-Herzegovina as of 10 January 1996, with a mission to transport supplies and all kinds
of equipment for the IFOR (Implementation Force) and then for the SFOR (Stabilisation
Force) from the airports and ports of this country, as well as from Croatia. The HFB is
stationed in a military compound in the town of Visoco, 45 km north-west of Sarajevo with
forces of Belgium, Luxembourg and Austria, and will remain there until completion of its
mission. The forces of these countries form BELUGA (initials of the participating countries)
and HFB is the leading nation since 1st April 1997, after the withdrawal of the major part of
the Belgian forces. Up to this date, for the implementation of its mission, HFB has traveled
3,300,000 km and has consumed 760,000 lt. of fuel without any accident. The daily
operational cost of HFB, covered entirely by the Hellenic MOD, is 12 million Drs, while the
total cost up to 30/7/97 was 6.8 billion Drs.

[(see map 1)](http://www.resdal.org.ar/Archivo/gre-cap3-3_1.htm)

The Hellenic Force of Albania (HFoA), consisting of 803 men and 224 vehicles, deployed in
Albania on April 16 1997, for operation ALBA with the following mission:

o To secure the main entry points in the area of operation, in order to ensure the
arrival of the humanitarian aid and the on time delivery at the distribution
stations.

o The creation of a safe environment for action for the International Committee
and the International Organisations that are involved in the provision of aid to
Albania.

o To create a safe environment for the elections of 19/6/97.

The HFoA was stationed in four military compounds of the Albanian Armed Forces in the
areas of Tirana (Camps Isbberish and Vaqar), Avlon and Elbasan.

**Missions of HFoA**

Missions conducted by HFoA include reconnaissance, securing of routes and escort of the
humanitarian aid of the international organisations in central and southern Albania, as well as


-----

transportation and security of the OSCE observers during the parliamentary elections. In total,
362 missions were executed, using 1,082 vehicles with the participation of 3,434 members of
HFoA. The total distance covered amounted to nearly 225,000 km. After the completion of
the mission of the Protection Force (FMP) within the time frame of the mandate, the
withdrawal of the HFoA began and was completed on 3/8/97, except for one Company (205
men), that remained at the isbberish camp, following a bilateral agreement between the
Governments of Albania and Greece. The main mission of this company is to assist the work
of Greek military advisors to reorganise the Albanian armed forces and to protect the Military
Hospital of Tirana built with Greek funds.

**1.2.8.2. The Hellenic Navy**

The Hellenic Navy is assigned to carry out the necessary missions and tasks in order to
contribute to the deterrence of any external threat, preserve the territorial integrity of the
country, protect Greece's sovereign rights and national interests and fulfil the objectives of the
national defence policy.

In order to achieve those tasks, Greece must project the maximum of its naval power. Greece
with its 3000 islands, the connecting link between the Black Sea, the Straits and the SE
Mediterranean, Cyprus and the Middle East, constitutes a region with significant geopolitical
and geoeconomic importance for the West, and as a result, the development of the naval
power is a principal defence objective.

The Hellenic Navy General Staff (HNGS) is the staff organisation which assists the Chief,
HNGS, and through him, the Minister of Defence in performing his duty: it is organised into
commands and directorates and covers a wide spectrum of activities and functions.

The Fleet Command, with headquarters in Salamis Naval Base, is tasked with the
organisation, command, operational training, maintenance, security, and war readiness of the
ships and the services of the Fleet Command.

(see graphic 4)

The Naval Training Command, with headquarters in Scaramangas, is tasked with the training


-----

of the cadres of the Navy and the career management of the other ranks.

The Logistic Support Command, with headquarters in Athens, is tasked with the provision of
optimum logistical support for the ships and the naval services. The Naval Bases of Salamis
and Crete, and the Naval Supply Centre are subordinate to this command.

The Naval Forces include separate commands and services, some operational such as the
Naval Commands, the Advanced Naval Bases, the MEDEAST HQS, 353 Airmaritime Cooperation Squadron, the 353 hydrographic service, and others of logistic support, such as the
Naval Cadets Academy, the Naval War Academy etc.
_The goals of the Hellenic Naval Strategy are as follows:_

o _deterrence_

o _naval presence_

o _sea control and_

o _power protection ashore_

The Fleet is a defence and deterrence instrument and it is tasked to:

o contribute to the safeguarding of Greece's territorial integrity,

o defend the country's sovereign rights on the continental shelf,

o maintain open sea-lines of communication, and

o contribute to the high morale of the population of the islands.

The fleet may conduct the following operations:

o maritime surveillance and collection of information throughout the Hellenic
seas. For this purpose, units of the Fleet constantly use the islands as their
bases to conduct continuous or occasional surveillance and reconnaissance
patrols;

o naval presence throughout the Mediterranean sea as an instrument of national
defence policy and manifestation of political determination;

o conduct of naval, airmaritime and joint exercises in an operational
environment, as well as the participation in allied exercises, for the purpose of
familiarising the personnel and ensuring high-level training;

(see graphic 5)

o maintenance of the Hellenic naval tradition, a centuries old heritage which has
brought the Hellenic civilisation through the seas;

o conduct of transports in support of the other services of the Armed Forces;

o use of naval power for crisis management;

o maintaining the regular flow in the local sea lines of communication;

o enhancing the morale of the population of the islands;

The naval presence on the Hellenic islands and particularly on those of the Eastern Aegean as
well as the wider region of the island of Kerkyra (Corfu) is continuous. This presence is
exercised by warship patrols which have the duty to confront any activities against Greece's
national security, assist the Coast Guard in intercepting the infiltration of illegal immigrants in
Greece as well as successfully tackle drugs trafficking, arms smuggling etc.

Ships, helicopters and other units of the Navy also contribute to social activities and
participate in peace-support missions. Naval operational training is conducted at various
levels, since the ships of the Fleet participate in both national and NATO exercises.


-----

The annual training programme conducted mainly afloat includes:

a. Large scale combined tactical exercises (LIVEX) with the participation of all the services
of the Armed Forces.

b. Medium and small scale tactical and technical exercises directed by various command
levels, starting from Flotilla Commands and Squadrons.

c. Large scale command post exercises (CPX).

d. Medium scale multinational technical exercises (INVITEX), in which the Navies of the
NATO-member countries are invited.

e. Participation in allied multinational INVITEX-type exercises of other countries.

The Navy, in order to successfully accomplish its mission, disposes a sizeable fleet consisting
mainly of attack units, such as frigates, destroyers, fast missile boats and submarines,
equipped with modern electronic and weapon systems, and numerous logistic boats (oil
tankers etc.) necessary for the support of battle units.

The destroyers and the frigates which constitute the core of the Hellenic Fleet, with large
displacement and strong fire power, can simultaneously conduct all types of missions such as
surface missions, air-defence and antisubmarine warfare.

Modern and effective weapons of the Navy include the surface-to-surface guided missiles
HARPOON, PENGUIN and EXOCET, the surface-to-air guided missiles SEA SPARROW
and STANDARD, as well as the air-to-air guided missiles PENGUIN fired from the modern
SHIKORSKY helicopters. These helicopters, together with the older AB-212 and the new
airmaritime co-operation aircraft P-3B, constitute the core of the Fleet's air-arm. They
participate both in surface operations and in anti-submarine missions, since they are equipped
with special submarine detection systems and respective weapons. The silent sail, the modern
electronic torpedoes and the sensitive sonar systems are the main features of the flexible 209
type submarines of the Hellenic Fleet. The presence of the fast boats of the Hellenic Navy in
the Aegean is continuous and dynamic.

**1.2.8.3. The Hellenic Air Force**

The mission of the Hellenic Air Force is to achieve air superiority, contribute to deterrence,
conduct intensive and sustained air missions, secure the air defence of the country, and
provide air protection. The Hellenic Air Force also supports the missions of other services of
the Armed Forces, supports the civilian sector in civil emergencies and conducts peacesupport missions and humanitarian aid missions, contributing, thus, to international peace and
security.

Air superiority is a modern defence tool against any crisis requiring demonstration of force,
and is characterised by speed, flexibility and effectiveness. Air superiority provides the
possibility to the country's Armed Forces to ensure the necessary control of the air space, a
prerequisite of deterrence.

**1.2.9. The Mod Staff**

A special advisory body, as in other WEU and NATO member-countries the MOD Staff, has
been operating since 1-1-96. This staff is not incorporated in the hierarchy of the General
Staffs, it is manned with military and civilian personnel with special skills and experience in
the administration of human resources, planning of armament programmes, preparation of
budgets and strategic studies, international relations, research and development in the military
sector, preparation of draft laws and also in social activities and public relations. the Minister
of National Defence is, thus, provided with complete information on subjects of his
responsibility, which, in turn, contributes to the good performance and the efficiency of the
Armed Forces.

The management, the programming and the control of the directorates of the MOD Staff fall
under the responsibility of the Director General, whose tour of duty is two years. He is
appointed by the Minister of National Defence and he must be a person with excellent
knowledge and significant experience in the subjects of the competence of the staff.

(see graphic 7)

Here are some of the most important activities of the MOD Staff for the period 1996 - 1997:

o the planning of the unified MOD budget of 1998.

HNDGS and the permanent representations of Greece abroad, of proposals for
the formulation Greece's positions in international organisations such as the
WEU and NATO.

o the preparation and implementation of bilateral defence agreements.

o the utilisation of the EU initiative "INTERREG" for the additional education
and training of the enlisted personnel.

o the contribution to the law drafting process on subjects of major importance
such as recruitment, the salary policy for officers and NCOs and also the career
of the permanent cadres of the Armed Forces.


-----

o the study of the restructuring of the operational framework of the Military
Academies and NCO schools, the establishment of professional orientation in
the Armed Forces and the improvement of the training of the civilian
personnel.

o the drafting of laws for the possibility of entry of migrant Hellenes to the
Military Academies, for the extension of benefits to peacetime casualties, to
national resistance and civil war combatants and for the moral reinstatement of
soldiers and victims of the Turkish invasion in Cyprus.

**1.2.10. Armaments General Directorate**

The directorate was created in 1996 to run the procurement programmes for the main
equipment of the Armed Forces, to process and present proposals for the defence technology,
research and development, to co-ordinate the procurement of materiel for the Armed Forces,
modify and standardise the materiel, take full advantage of the offsets and assume the
international representation of the Ministry in the armaments sector.

So far, the Armaments General Directorate has carried out important tasks such as:

o the intensification of the restructuring and the improvement of the domestic
defence industry.

o the signing of many contracts for the procurement of defence equipment with
significant offsets in the fields of sub-contractors and transfer of know-how.

o the implementation of a series of inter-governmental defence co-operation
agreements in the fields of procurement and technology.

o the co-ordination of unified provisions for the procurement of similar - other
than the main - equipment for all General Staffs and, in addition thorough
examination of the possibility of their production by the domestic industry.

_Armament Programmes_

The Directorate is the agency responsible for the implementation of programmes of
acquisition of main defence equipment as well as the signing of the respective contracts. This
responsibility covers all the programmes implemented for the first time after the approval of
the 1996-2000 EMPAE.

_Defence Industry_

The Directorate's aim is to increase the hellenisation rate of MOD procurements. The
activities until today focus on:

o proposals to determine the sources of procurement

o informing the defence industry about the procurement programmes

o control of the implementation of the contracts

o organisation of specialist's committees

o participation in procurement committees

o certification of quality control systems

o participation in research programmes

o participation in international development and construction programmes


-----

o controlling and proposing on financial issues of state industries, supervised by
the MOD

o provision of government guarantees for loans to the defence industry

o ensuring the participation of domestic industry in co-production

o ensuring production and know-how through various offset benefits.

(see graphic 8)

Especially, in order for the domestic production of materiel for the Armed Forces to be
increased, a committee was formed with the main task to submit certain proposals. So far,
proposals submitted cover the following:

o Creation of a data base.

o Domestic production of materiel - spare parts (determination of materiel
producable in Greece).

o Licence for domestic production of material - spare parts.

o Technological, economic studies of programmes for main equipment (studies
for hellenisation).

o Registration of Hellenic constructors.

o Legal status.

o Programmes

The objective is to increase the participation percentage of the domestic industry at 15% of
the EMPAE.

_International Relations_

_1. Targets_

The main targets of the Directorate's international relations are:
a. The active participation in international organisations and the exploitation of
intergovernmental co-operation agreements for Greece's procurement policy.

b. The equal participation of the MOD in the decisions for the development of a common
European Security and Defence identity (ESDI).

c. The elaboration of the convergence programme of the Hellenic Defence Industry and
establishment of financial resources to ensure its viability and competitiveness within the
Open European Defence Market.

d. Planning and implementation, in co-operation with industry, of an active marketing
programme aiming at the promotion of export activities of our defence industry.

For each of the aforementioned targets, an implementation study has been scheduled which
will define the various activities, means and human resources required, as well as the
necessary co-operation in national (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of National
Economy, Organisation for Export promotion, Hellenic Industries association, Hellenic
Ordnance Manufacturing Association, etc.) and international (DDI Countries) level.


-----

_2. Participation in International Organisations and Programmes_
e. The directorate actively participates in fora and activities of international organisations such
as NATO, WEAG, WEAO and also in a series of important programmes in order to improve
the capabilities of the country in critical armaments sectors and, in addition, to modernise the
defence industry.

f. Our country participates in the National Armaments Directors (NAD) conference which is
one of the highest level organs of NATO in the field of co-operation in armaments.

systems, modernisation of RADARS, new frigates, satellite systems, communication and
electronic warfare systems, etc.

In addition, the participation of Greece to the Joint Armament co-operation organisation is
now under consideration.

_3. Bilateral co-operation_

In the framework of international relations the directorate maintains bilateral contacts with
respective services of countries that have signed Defence Industrial Mous with Greece.

It should be noted that 8 out of 14 Defence Industrial Co-operation Mous have been signed
during 1996-97.

The committees established by these Mous have regular meetings.

The purpose of all these co-operative efforts is to improve relations between the countries at
the industrial level, but mainly to increase the participation of the Hellenic Defence Industries,
either state or private, to the implementation of the domestic armaments programmes, either
directly or in the form of industrial offsets.

Furthermore, the directorate, through inter-governmental relations and in co-operation with


-----

other involved agencies (Hellenic Ordnance Manufacturing and export association, Hellenic
Industry association) encourages the defence industries to participate in international
exhibitions.

_Offset Programmes_

The programmes that were implemented or are in progress through offsets can be divided in
three categories:

o The assignment of work to the Hellenic defence industry.

o Transfer - provision of know how - construction plans - production equipment

        - reception facilities or investments.

o Delivery of materiel or services to the Armed Forces.

o So far, production awards to the defence industry reach the total net amount of
35.5 billion Drs.

Most of the orders placed cover materiel and systems of high technology, such as aircraft
structural material and spare parts, missiles spares and accessories, electronic parts of
RADARS, etc.

_Co-ordination Procurement of General (Non-Main) Equipment_

_1. Formulations_

The following arrangements and formulations are made:

o Determination of processes.

o Standardisation of the legal framework of procurement of general equipment
for the Armed Forces.

o Harmonisation, on a joint basis, of process for procurement (long-term
contracts, common pricing readjustment formula, etc.).

o Separation of equipment in main and general.

_2. Implementation of procurement_

At this stage, the directorate co-ordinated and formulated proposals for major procurement of
general equipment for the General Staffs.

_3. Standardisation - codification of equipment_

o A permanent joint committee has been established to improve codification of
equipment.

o Computerised support of the codification system is under examination.

o Co-ordination and control of NATO STANAGs have been reviewed.

o Codification process and implementation of codification clause were
improved, in co-operation with the General

_Control of Hellenic Added Value - pricing - Quality Control_


-----

o Application of relevant contract clauses was controlled concerning the Hellenic
Added Value percentage and the quality control of materiel.

o Legal instructions were issued on quality control and verification of an Added
Value percentage.

o Price lists were established for many materials for contract drafting purposes.

_Research-Technology-Development_

A specific strategy is implemented as a first stage with the following steps:
a. For the first time, a budget of research and technology was drafted (FY 1998) to finance
research and development programmes.

b. Development programmes of defence equipment are promoted, especially in the sector of
guided weapons, telecommunications and surveillance.

c. Specific research programmes are promoted in order to make the Hellenic Defence Industry
and the Hellenic Research Centres capable to develop defence material.

In addition specific administrative measures were approved, in order to enhance the MOD
Research Centres and to improve the control of the research programmes.

The short-term goals in the R&D sector include:

o Further development of the above mentioned activities.

o Improvement of the technological communications and the creation of hightechnology scientific units in priority areas.

o The completion of the framework of the research policy.

o The establishment of computerised infrastructure to facilitate the access of the
defence industry and the various research centres in the country to
technological / research data.

o Co-operation with the databases of the MODs of friendly nations.

o Further exploitation of WEAG and NATO.

**1.2.11. Integrated Administrative Agency**

In 1994, an Integrated Administrative Agency was established at the MOD in order to
harmonise and co-ordinate issues that concern the civilian personnel of the Armed Forces.
This Agency consists of the Civilian Personnel Directorates of the General Staffs of the
Armed Forces, under the direction of a Special Secretary.

He/she is given the following responsibilities:

Recruitment, except for the special scientific personnel, appointment of training personnel, at
Military Academy, assignment, appointments permanent civilian personnel, reassignment and
temporary transfers and change of status of the civilian personnel for physical or mental
incapacitation, temporary suspension, re-appointment, diminishing, annulment of contracts,

The training of the career personnel aims at providing the armed forces with personnel in the
entire command structure consisting of Officers able to command their units, to occupy
critical posts of specialisation, and to meet the multi-directional staff demands.

Each year, enlisted personnel join the armed forces to do their military service which is
compulsory according to Greek legislation. The number of enlisted personnel serving depends
on the number of persons registered each year in the recruiting records.

It should be noted that due to the demographic problem in our country, class performance is
gradually decreasing. It has been estimated that the class of the year 2011 (born in 1990) will
be only 57.6% of the year 1955 class (born in 1934). It has also been estimated that only
60.3% of the enlisted people that are called in each class finally joins the armed forces. For
the class of the year 1999, it has been estimated that the percentage of the enlisted people will
be about 50%. The main reason for not joining is the deferment due to studies or health
problems.

The continuous decrease of the draftee resources is expected to have a negative effect to the
combat effectiveness of the armed forces, in case the present structure and recruiting system
are maintained.

The Ministry of Defence is oriented to a radical re-structuring of the armed forces, in order to
significantly improve their combat effectiveness and overcome the weaknesses of the present
system.

One of the priorities of the Ministry of Defence is to improve the salaries of the armed forces
personnel, to correspond with their performance. A new bill was passed for the wages of the
armed forces personnel, which also covers the personnel of the security forces, the Coastguard and the Fire Department.

The new salary policy is based on the following principles:
a. A fixed rate has been established between the minimum wages of all ranks to the minimum
wages of the second lieutenant.

b. The abolition and incorporation of the thirteen out of sixteen existing allowances, as well as
the automatically calculated consumer's index increase, with the exception of the service and
family allowances. These extra payments will remain at the same level with the ones of the
civilian personnel.

c. Retainment and rescheduling of the rationalisation allowance which regulates payment
differences.


-----

d. A special employment allowance for all cadres and as a staff responsibility allowance for
the General/Flag Officers, due to the importance of their position, were also established.

Law 2439/96 is of major importance for the personnel of the armed forces because it regulates
"the command structure and the career of the Officers in the armed forces" and rationalises
the system, related to the cadres of the armed forces:

o The meritorious and rapid promotion of capable Officers.

o The establishment of a percentage rating scale for the evaluation of the
Officers.

o The establishment of fixed criteria for assignments.

o The provision of the possibility for all capable Officers omitted from the
promotion lists for General/Flag

(4) years.

Upon graduation they are commissioned as Second Lieutenants - Ensigns - Air Force Second
Lieutenants and according to their specialty, they attend Application Schools. They are
assigned and promoted like their male colleagues.

Law 2510/97 for the "settlement of military obligations of some categories of male enlisted,
draft evaders and soldiers, amendment to the recruiting legislation, establishment of
alternative service and other provisions" which was ratified in 1997 by Parliament, attempts to
settle a number of issues related to the fulfillment of the military obligations of Greek
citizens. The new law responds to the new facts and problems that arose in the period from
the previous law on the "National Drafting System" until today.

o _The new staff organisation provides for subordination of all recruiting offices_
_to the HNDGS through regional directorates._

o _The computerisation study of all recruiting offices has been completed by the_
_University of Athens._

o _Detailed instructions were issued to the recruiting offices regarding the_
_expedient service of citizens._

o _The new standard operating procedures of all recruiting offices was ratified,_
_effective 1-7-97. The new procedures establish bureaucracy suppression_
_measures, expedient service of citizens, the simplification of procedures and_
_the decentralisation of authority._

The new law has taken into consideration the critical demographic situation dictating the
imposition of stricter criteria, in allowing deferment and exceptions from compulsory service
and offering incentives for younger generations to join the armed forces at the youngest
possible age. This measure was considered appropriate to restrict insubordination and
working out the chronic problem of draft evaders.

The new law aims to:

o Modernise the National recruiting System.

o Regulate with rationalised criteria the deferment and exception system.

o Integrate all valid but separate recruiting provisions of laws.

o Motivate a large number of draft evaders to enlist in the Armed Forces by
providing serious incentives.

Specifically, the assignment of specialities to the conscripts is based on their education and
their physical and psychological abilities, while at the same time it takes into consideration
the needs of the Armed Forces. Thus, not only greater operational effectiveness is achieved
for the units, but also the qualifications of the conscripts are utilised and expanded, so that
after their discharge they also have work experience in their respective fields.

The determination of the abilities of the recruits is achieved mainly through medical
examinations, while the assignment of specialities is mainly computerised.

o one-day orientation course at a Unit close to their residence.

_The Veteran Combatants, War Casualties and Invalids Directorate developed, in the last two_
_years, special activity in order to fulfil the requirements of social groups including invalids_
_and war casualties. Among them, there are activities which concern reserve officers as well as_
_those concerning the awarding to veteran reservists for their participation in the National_
_Resistance._

The discharged Potential Reserve officers attend training courses in respective Schools of
their Service and Arms/Corps in order to qualify for promotion, while reserve soldiers are
trained in respective Training Centres to receive a second or third specialty, in addition to the
one they had when discharged.

It is characteristic that due to the demographic problems of the country, the needs of the active
Units, anticipated to be complemented with reserve personnel, are increasing. Furthermore, it
is estimated that the use of the appropriate computer system for reserve forces, will drastically
reduce the time of mobilisation, if needed.

**5. CIVIL DEFENCE**

Civil defence is the participation in the national defence of the available local potential of
both sexes, who can provide services and is not included in the Armed Forces and the
National Guard complements. The concept of civil defence is based on the notion that the
National Defence is and must be an affair concerning all citizens, requiring nation-wide
mobilisation. In this sense, the term means:

o the gradual incorporation of wider population groups into the defence planning
for mobilisation in the event of a threat to our national security; and

o the awakening and the essential contribution of the civilians to defence
activities.

The peace-time mission of the Civil Defence is:

o The political protection, i.e. dealing with natural, technological or other
disasters.


-----

The missions of Civil Defence during crises or war include:

(a) The political defence, i.e. blackout, camouflage of sensitive areas, population warning
about air-strikes etc.

(b) Area defence.

Related subjects are governed by a bill of law, the discussion of which has already started and
is expected to be completed in mid 1998.

**_CIVIL EMERGENCY PLANNING_**

_The Civil Emergency Planning includes the planning and the programming of the_
_organisation, preparation and activation of the country's civilian forces, for survival during_
_the war as well as for handling of emergency situations, disasters or serious technical_
_accidents, in peace or war._

_The mission of the Civil Emergency Planning is carried out according to decisions of the_
_Government Council on Foreign Affairs and National Defence, by all the Ministries and_
_subordinate agencies. The Ministry of National Defence is the highest responsible co-_
_ordinating Agency for providing guidance to civilian agencies involved._

_The main activities of the Civil Emergency Planning are:_

          - _the co-ordination and monitoring, in co-operation with the Ministry of_
_Public Order, of the defence policy concerning the protection and_
_survival of civilians in war time;_

          - _the co-ordination and monitoring of statutory and organisational_
_subjects of its responsibility, as well as the organisation of exercises at_
_national level;_

          - _the co-ordination and organisation, in co-operation with the Ministry_
_of Public Order, of civilian personnel, of organisations and of_
_enterprises employees training;_

          - _the determination of the way and the extent of involvement of the_
_Armed Forces, in both the prevention and handling of natural or_
_technological disasters;_

          - _the determination of the way and the extent of involvement of the_
_Armed Forces in the reforestation of the country;_

          - _finally, the co-operation with foreign countries and international_
_organisations, such as the UN, NATO, and the WEU in emergency_
_related situations._

**6. MEDICAL SERVICE**

The mission of this service is mainly the medical support of the Armed Forces in case of war
and its contribution to the sustainment of the physical condition of the Armed Forces
personnel. In order to carry out this mission, the medical service disposes, from peacetime,
the required personnel and means for:


-----

o Early response to emergencies and proper training of the medical personnel, in
the units

o High level hospitalisation, special medical support (e.g. for airmen and divers)
as well as training - specialisation of the personnel, in hospitals.

The current structure of the medical corps of the three Services consists of:

- Medical Corps Directorates, which are Staff organisations responsible for medical matters,
in peace and war;

- Military Hospitals, which provide hospitalisation to the military and civilian personnel of the
Armed Forces as well as to other social groups (the Hellenic Police, the Fire Department as
well as to civilians), providing auxiliary services to the National Health System;

- Special Medical Committees;

- Infirmaries in Units, Ships and Air-bases;

- Mobilisation Units of the Medical service for the Army;

- Ship Hospitals for the treatment and evacuation of casualties in time of war for the Navy;

- Field surgeries-hospitals for the treatment of casualties in air-bases, in time of war, for the
Air Force.

**The Army Medical Corps**

First echelon medical aid is provided by the medical staff of the units, the return services and
the outpatients wards of the military hospitals. Hospitalisation is provided by the military
hospitals (401 Athens General Military Hospital and 424 General Training Military Hospital
in Thessaloniki) and, in case that is not feasible, by civilian hospitals.

In order to monitor the health of the military personnel, as well as some specialties of civilian
personnel (Orderly, Microbiology and X-ray Technicians, Barbers, Cooks etc.), medical
examinations are conducted at unit level and in all the military hospitals. All Army personnel
undergo annual medical examinations. Military Academy candidates as well as Corps
Officers, Orderly and NCOs Schools, the five year term volunteer candidates, and the
conscripts not capable of joining the Recruit Training Centres due to serious health problems,
are also examined in the military hospitals.

The training of the medical officers and NCOs is conducted at the Medical Application
School under the supervision of the Medical Directorate, HAGS.

The Supreme Army Medical Committee is the responsible agency to provide physical
condition certificates.

The number of hospitalised (of all categories) in the Army Hospitals reaches 200,000
annually.


-----

**Navy Medical Corps**

First echelon medical aid is provided by the sick-bays of the naval services and war ships and
the outpatients wards of naval hospitals (Athens Naval Hospital, Crete Naval Hospital,
salamis naval Hospital). Hospitalised treatment is provided by the clinics and laboratories of
naval hospitals. In case that this is not feasible, treatment is provided by other state or private
clinics.

The Supreme Naval Medical Committee is the agency responsible for providing physical
condition certificates. It also decides on the initial induction or enlistment of personnel in the
Navy.

In detail, the Navy medical Corps consists of 198 physicians, 15 pharmacists, 18 dentists and
137 orderlies. The number of hospitalised (of all categories) in the Hellenic Naval Hospitals
reaches 12.000 annually. The number of available beds in Naval Hospitals is 440.

**Air force Medical corps**

First echelon medical aid is provided by the medical services of the units and the outpatients
wards of the 251 General Air force Hospital. In order to monitor the health of the military
personnel, as well as some specialties of the civilian personnel (Barbers, Cooks etc.) medical
examinations are conducted at unit level, at the 251 General Airforce Hospital and at the Air
Medicine Centre.

The medical examinations of pilots for certifying their flying ability is effected in the Air
Medicine Centre. During the medical examination of these Officers, training is also provided
in flight physiology subjects. The training of medical officers in air medicine is conducted at
the Air Medicine Training School under the supervision of the Air Medicine Centre.
Examinations for all Air force Schools candidates also take place in the Air Medicine Centre.

The Supreme Air force Medical Committee is the agency responsible for providing physical
condition certificates. it also decides on the initial induction of any person, military or civilian
in the flying personnel.

**7. MILITARY JUSTICE**

A new Armed Forces Judicial Corps code was established by law 2304/95. The provisions of
this code apply to the Armed Forces judicial corps military judges. A new legal status
established by these provisions conferred multiple institutional changes in the Armed Forces
judicial organisation and the status of military judges.

The new code guarantees functional and personal independence of the judiciary (Art. 96 par. 5
of the Constitution), the lack of which had provoked serious difficulties related to the
administration of justice and personal independence of military judges. The Armed Forces
judiciary corps is directly subordinate to the Minister of National Defence.

The Ministry of National Defence has established a Directorate of Military Justice, directly
subordinate to the Minister of National Defence.


-----

The responsibilities regulated by the Code cannot be transferred to other agencies and are
implemented by the Directorate of Military Justice.

The Judiciary are administered by the Supreme Judicial Council, which deals with
promotions, transfers, and runs the services' affairs without the involvement of the Armed
Forces, as was the case until today.

The members of the judiciary are assigned strictly and purely legal duties, even when they
work in administrative positions. The disciplinary jurisdiction applied to the Armed Forces
judiciary is exercised by the Supreme Court, the five and eleven member Section of the Court
of Appeal and the Supreme Disciplinary Board according to Art. 91 of the Constitution.

Staff organisation of the Armed Forces Judiciary is as follows:

**RANK** **POSTS SERVING PERSONNEL**

Military judge A' 1 1

Military judge B' 3 3

Military judge C' 7 7

Judge in the Court of Appeal A' 16 16

Judge in the Court of Appeal B' 24 20

Judge in the Court of Appeal C' 31 20

Judge in the Court of Appeal D' 29 40

Deputies 28      
The responsibilities of the above mentioned personnel are included in the Armed Forces
judicial code and the Military Penal Code.

In August 1995, the new military penal code was ratified by the first article of law 2287/95.
Most Military Courts are mainly composed by judges. Prosecution under this code was
transferred from the Commander of a major military formation to the Prosecutor of the
respective Military court.

Today the following military courts operate in Hellas: six army-courts in Athens,
Thessaloniki, Xanthi, Larissa, Khania and Ioannina, two naval courts in Piraeus and Khania,
three air courts in Athens, Larissa and Khania, and one Court of Appeal in Athens.

The composition of these courts is:

|RANK|POSTS|SERVING PERSONNEL|
|---|---|---|
|Military judge A'|1|1|
|Military judge B'|3|3|
|Military judge C'|7|7|
|Judge in the Court of Appeal A'|16|16|

The responsibilities, replacements and exceptions applicable to them, are detailed in the new
military penal code.

Application of the above Codes is a major step forward for the fast conduct of trials and the
administration of justice.

In May 1997 the Directorate of Military Justice organised in Athens the 15th International
Conference on Humanitarian Law and Armed Conflicts with a wide participation from the
international legal community.

Finally, visits were exchanged with delegations from the Judicial Corps of Poland, Romania
and other countries.

**CHAPTER 5: THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE HELLENIC ARMED FORCES**

**1. DEFENCE EXPENDITURES**

The necessity of ensuring a reliable and effective deterrent force against the increasing
aggression and arms build-ups of Turkey resulted in to a growing strain on the National
Budget and Public Deficit due to defence expenditures. This is demonstrated by the steadily
growing trend in recent years of the budget of the Ministry of National Defence and the total
defence expenditures in absolute figures.

(see graphic 1)

During the last decade, the budget of the Ministry of National Defence in current prices has
undergone an average annual growth of 15%. It should be noted that, compared to the 1995
budget, there is an increase of 19.8%.

(see graphic 2)

|*Temporary date. ** Estimate.||||||||


In 1988, the operational budget of the MOD represented 12.1% of the National Budget while,
for 1997, the percentage is around 6%.

(see graphic 3)

Despite the gradual reduction of the Defence Budget and the overall defence expenditures,
compared to the National Budget and the Gross National Product, the expenses for national
defence remain at a high level, especially if we take into consideration the capabilities of the
Hellenic economy. It should be noted that our country is the NATO member country with the
highest percentage of defence expenditures compared to the Gross National Product.

It is also noteworthy that out of all the resources made annually available to cover the
country's defence requirements, only 34.7%, in average, represents appropriations for
development, i.e. expenses for the procurement of weapon systems while the remaining
65.3% is used to cover personnel salaries and operational costs.

Furthermore, it is estimated that around 50% of development appropriations of the MOD
Budget is made available for the repayment of loans and other requirements of the previous
years.

Particularly for 1997, the development expenditures reached 267 billion drs which represents
the 28.25% of the MOD Budget, i.e. 1.79% of the National Budget and 0.81% of the GNP.
Besides, appropriations around 122.5 million USD are anticipated from FMF loans for the
1997 armament programmes.

Considering the fact that the previous commitments from the implementation of armament
programmes increase annually at a fast rate, there is an obvious need for greater
rationalisation in the use of existing resources. The aim of the policy, which the MOD


-----

follows, is to gradually orientate the defence expenditures mainly towards development.
Today, achieving this objective is considered much more essential, due to the drastic increase
of Turkey's defence expenditures during the last years. If, at the same time, we take into
consideration the fact that the demographic problem of the country is expected to have an
impact on the manning of the units, the significance of the target implementation for the
maintenance of the deterrent capability of the Hellenic Armed Forces becomes apparent.

The aim of the development-oriented defence expenditures means the gradual taking of
measures, on one hand, in the direction of stabilising the obligation/ credit relationship during
the next years and, on the other, a more rational distribution of defence expenditures. The
minimization of non-productive expenses, the redefinition of procurement requirements on
the basis of their development result and the linkage of procurement programmes with the
capabilities of domestic industry, form the policies which can accomplish this target.

The better exploitation of resources, which will be thus achieved will allow, in the long term,
the reduction of the defence budget in absolute figures, while, at the same time, the country's
defence capability will be maintained.

**1.1. Armaments programmes**

Today' s requirements for increased defense ability of the Armed Forces are depicted and
satisfied through the Unified Medium Term Programmes of Development and Modernisation
(EMPAE).

These are successive five-year plans first introduced in 1988, which refer to the procurement
and funding of main weapon systems.

In November 1996, the 1996-2000 EMPAE of 4 trillion drs was approved by the Government
Council on Foreign Affairs and Defence, out of which 1.95 trillion drs is expected to be
disbursed until 2000, immediately after the placing of orders, and the remaining according to
deliveries.

_For the economic support of the effort to improve the defence ability of the country through a_
_nation-wide contribution, the National Fund for the Armed Forces Procurement (NFAFP) has_
_been established, which is a legal entity of public law, subject to the Minister of Defence,_
_through his staff. The Fund's financing of operational costs is effected through the ordinary_
_budget. Supervision and instruments of NFAFP are:_

**_• The National Supervision Council which consists of the President of the Parliament, a_**
_representative of each party with parliamentary representation, the Minister of National_
_Defence, the Minister of National Economy, a representative of the Hellenic diaspora_
_communities in America, Africa, Australia, Europe and Asia who will be proposed by the_
_Council of Diaspora Hellenism, a representative of the Central Union of Municipalities and_
_Villages of Greece and representatives of every productive class (Hellenic Industries_
_Association, Professional Chambers, Supreme Administrative Union of Civilian Employees,_
_Hellenic General Workers Confederation, Hellenic General Confederation of Agricultural_
_Associations, Hellenic Chamber of Commerce)._

**_• The Administrative Council_**

For achieving the targets set for upgrading and improving the quality of the Armed Forces, the
five-year plan 1996-2000 is characterised by the following points:

o Emphasis is given to new technologies with a shift towards the acquisition of
communication and intelligence collection systems, "smart" weapons and other
force multipliers.

o Justified purchasing of weapon systems, through new procedures which
improve the transparency with regard to the procurements, necessitating the
justification of the acquisition of a weapon system on the basis of specific
operational requirements.

o Coordination of the three services of the Armed Forces in order to give a
common priority with regard to arms procurement.

The main funding sources for the armament programme included in the EMPAE are :

a) National Budget Funds

b) Foreign and Domestic Loans


-----

c) U.S. Loans (FMF)

For the 1996-2000 EMPAE, the percentage of participation of each of the above sources in
armament funding programmes is 32%, 60% and 8% respectively.

The main armament programmes which are expected to be implemented or are being
implemented concern :

o For the Army, acquisition of attack helicopters, transport helicopters, various
types of vehicles, main battle tanks, multiple rocket launchers, anti-aircraft
systems, Stinger missiles, telecommunication and electronic warfare
equipment, target acquisition radars and others.

o For the Navy, upgrading of submarines and building of MEKO-type frigates,
landing ships-tanks (lst), patrol vessels, missile boats, corvettes, acquisition of
new submarines, fast transport boats, fleet oil tankers, helicopters, guided
missiles and light and heavy type torpedoes.

**_State-Of-The-Art Command Control, Communications_**
**_And Information Systems_**

_The Army has begun the process of procuring unmanned air-vehicles for tactical surveillance,_
_moving target radars and a large number of Geographical Positioning Systems (GPS)._
_Together with the other services and under the coordination of the Hellenic National Defence_
_General Staff (HNDGS), the Army is proceeding with the introduction of a joint Command_
_Control Communication and Information System._

_This system will support the new force structure and the joint operations of the three services_
_of the Armed Forces._

_At the same time, the Air Force is considering the acquisition of an airborne early warning_
_and control radar system for the collection of information on the movement of friendly and_
_hostile aircraft in the air-space in real time._

o For the Air Force, extension of the life-cycle and upgrading of AVIONICS of
the A-7E and RF-4E fighter aircraft, acquisition of new fighter aircraft, search
and rescue helicopters (SAR), airborne early warning systems (AEW),
upgrading of operational equipment, acquisition of medium transport aircraft,
smart weapons and air-defence systems in order to replace the ''NIKE'' system.

o Continuation of the independent communication programmes of the services of
the Armed Forces and of the joint national defence communication system and
launching of a satellite communications system programme.

**2. THE HELLENIC DEFENCE INDUSTRY**

In the context of internationalisation of the market, the role, competitive position and
prospects of the domestic defence industry depend, to a great degree, on the objective
conditions, which tend to develop in the international market for defence equipment.

The Ministry of National Defence is making significant efforts to ensure the viability and to
increase the competitiveness of the Hellenic defence industry, increasing its share in the
market, supporting its export activity and encouraging a turn to the production of military
products.


-----

Despite the attempts to cleanse and develop the field, the percentage of the Hellenic defence
industry's participation in equipping and supplying the Armed Forces remains remarkably
low. While approximately a billion dollars are spent each year for the procurement of military
equipment, only 5% is channeled to the Hellenic defence industry, which remains
problematic.

**Note: Hellenic Powder & Cartridge Company, SA (HPCC) economic results after 1994 are**
balanced before interest and depreciation. Particularly, the economic results for 1996 show
some strain because, in the framework of the cleansing, the company took into consideration
fines and augmentation that had been ascribed to it and consequently put in on the stock
market according to article 14 of the 2303/95 law (which concerned the economic cleansing
of the state defence industries).

This is mainly due to weaknesses in the areas of organisation, marketing, programming and
labour relations; also to the low productivity, the high administrative costs, overborrowing, as
well as to the large fluctuation of the orders. The solution of these problems constitutes the
necessary condition for the harmonisation of the Hellenic defence industries with the
requirements and trends of the international market.

Under the current working conditions, the Hellenic Defence Industry offers the following
services:

- Maintenance - repair - production of structural sections and engine parts for aircraft and
helicopters.

- Production of parts and upgrading of missiles.

- Production of electronic sub - assemblies.

- Production of small arms, infantry heavy weapons, anti-aircraft systems, etc.

- Production of aircraft droppable fuel tanks.

- Production of military clothing.

- Production of various types of ammunition and charges for special projectiles.

- Co-production of various types of vehicle and armoured vehicles.

- Production of state of the art telecommunication, observation and vision devices.

- Building and upgrading of ships.

- Maintenance and upgrading of tanks, guns and weapon systems.

- Production of spare-parts.

Despite the fact that the domestic production units inherited high debts from previous years,
there has been a gradual return to stability during the last two years and in some cases even to
profit. Particularly in 1996, and according to estimates also in 1997, the Hellenic defence
industry turn-over has shown a stable rise. A similar positive trend is also seen in the exports,
a fact that depicts the success of an "aggressive" marketing programme, taken up during the
aforementioned period.

Although the sector of domestic defence industry cannot yet be described as competitive, the


-----

prospects for development and expansion in supplying the Armed Forces are realistic. For this
reason a systematic and collective effort is required both from the state bodies as well as from
the management and workers in the Hellenic defence industry, in order to make it profitable.

Finally, the development of a strong network of bilateral or multilateral cooperations with
countries with an advanced defence industry, is expected to significantly contribute to
reaching the target of adjusting with the contemporary tendencies of the European and
international market.

**2.1. The "hellenisation" of supplies**

A continuous point of reference in the MOD's procurement policy during 1996-1997 is the
gradual hellenisation of supplies, in such a way that the domestic defence industry becomes
the main supplier of weapon systems to the Hellenic Armed Forces. The fact that the Hellenic
defence industry absorbs only 5% of the funds available for military equipment for the Armed
Forces results in a high degree of foreign dependence and, at the same time, in a huge outflow
of foreign currency. On the other hand, the transformation of the industry's production units to
reliable suppliers of high technology weapon systems in-country and abroad will bring
multiple benefits to the Armed Forces defence capability, as well as to the Greek economy.

The attempt to support the domestic defence industry is expressed through particular action at
statutory, management and technological research level. One should mention Law 2303/95,
on the "Non-enforcement of penalty clauses and interest", according to which the state
defence industries are relieved of their accumulated losses of previous years. Thus, the
industry's units are released from unbearable financial costs. In addition, according to the
Presidential Decree, 439/95 concerning the "General Armaments Directorate", the
restructuring efforts of the defence industry is assisted and the processes of co-ordinating their
productive abilities with the needs of the General Staffs are ensured. Of special importance
for the viability and improvement of the competitiveness of the industry is the attempt to
enforce the practice of five-year contracts for General Staff orders, which shall allow them to
rationalise their productive process.

On a managerial level, the attempts have been focused on the drawing up of operational plans,
based on the 1996-2000 EMPAE as well as on increasing its capability of entering into the
international market of military equipment.

In the context of the above-mentioned attempts, a closer cooperation with research centres
(military or civilian) is sought, in order that new technology be incorporated both into the
production process as well as into the products themselves.

In the attempt to upgrade the defence industry products, international cooperation plays an
important role through the transfer of accumulated knowledge and experience from abroad.

Greek defence industry is called upon to confront with great challenges, especially in the
international arena. The Ministry's target is that the defence industry be gradually transformed
into a development booster and become a field upon which technological and research
programmes are materialised, while the results of those programmes are used in other areas,
in addition to national defence. The Hellenic defence industry plans to become an area for
investment and development of a huge reserve of scientific knowledge.


-----

Efforts for the integration of the E.U. and the formation of a common European Security and
Defence Identity are rapidly advancing. Our country will be called upon to respond to the
challenges of a unified European armaments market, with the lifting of every form of trade
protection, despite the particularities due to its geopolitical position. There is therefore an
imperative need to participate in international cooperative projects, especially within the
WEAG (Western European Armament Group), so that Greece can accelerate the development
and improvement process of its competitiveness with regard to its industrial infrastructure,
through the assimilation of valuable experience from the industrially more advanced
countries.

For this reason, our country actively participates in a long term research programme, called
EUCLID (European Co-operation For Long Term In Defence).

Similar programmes in the area of research and technology as well as in the co-production of
defence equipment are being materialised both in the framework of NATO and through other
bilateral or multilateral agreements.

**3. THE NEW MILITARY INSTALLATIONS**

National defence priorities which imposed the new organisational structure of the Armed
Forces, that was recently adopted by the Government Council on Foreign Affairs and
Defence, force us to prepare land-planning studies and seek solutions, which will meet the
requirements for large, modern and operational camps, thus achieving the required operational
readiness level.

At the time of the initial establishment of the camps, the built-up areas were obviously of
smaller size, whereas the boundaries of the urban areas were very limited compared to the
present ones. The camps were then established on the periphery or outside the urban areas, at
positions which not only met the requirements of the camps, but were also compatible with
the use of land of the specific area.

Because of the disorderly post-war model of development (centralisation, urbanisation, etc.),
the cities spread out at a fast, mostly uncontrolled pace, without rational distribution and
organisation of the use of land. A direct consequence of this process was the containment of
the camps within the urban areas of the cities and - in most cases - in immediate vicinity with
uses of land that are incompatible with the purpose, the functioning and the requirements of
the camps.

The cost of establishing new, large, modern camps is considerable, estimated to amount to
tens of billion drachmas. This cost cannot be borne by the Armed Forces and the national
budget, under the present financial conditions, not even in a long-term planning.

For the above reasons, promotion of a complete, nation-wide programme was adopted, for the
relocation of camps, upgrading, at the same time, the urban areas.

The financing of this programme will be implemented through financial resources, which will
come from development of the existing in-cities military installations, a development that is
planned being always in mind that the further goal is to maximise the social profit.


-----

The programme of taking military installations away from urban centres and their relocation
to new areas includes camps all over the country, its main goal being to meet the present and
long-term MOD operational requirements on national defence, whereas, at the same time,
contributing to the improvement of the environmental conditions, the upgrading of living
standards and the restoration of the continuity and regular functioning of the urban area. A
framework of co-operation has been agreed upon among the Ministry of National Defence,
the Ministry of Environment, Country Planning and Public Works and the A' and B' level
Local Authorities Organisations concerning the planning and implementation of this
programme.

For the fulfillment of the above goals, the National Defence Fund, that has the ownership of
the releasable camp areas, and the Ministry of National Defence, in the context of its
responsibility for planning the national defence strategy, will establish an autonomous, selfreliant and independent body, in the form of a Legal Entity of the Private Sector governed by
the regulations of the Civil Code and supervised by the Minister of National Defence.

This programme constitutes an extensive and efficient intervention, that offers the capability
to significantly upgrade the military installations and to contribute to social development.

**CHAPTER 6: THE SOCIAL CONTRIBUTION OF THE ARMED FORCES**

The armed forces contribute with personnel, equipment, and means to the prevention and
relief of emergencies due to natural and technological causes: fires, floods, snow-falls,

_Fighting drugs_

Since the beginning of 1997, a campaign was launched in military units, all over the country
to prevent and fight drug abuse.

The aims of this campaign are:

o No one in the army to be addicted to drugs.

o No cadre or enlisted to use drugs, inside or outside military installations.

o Occasional users (i.e. all those that have used drugs a few times, out of
curiosity, imitation, show-off, etc.) to stop taking drugs, to be incorporated in
the army, to be trained in their specialty, to complete their service, and to be reincorporated in the society.

o Addicts to be identified as soon as possible in order to be sent to specialised
hospitals for medical examination and treatment.

The Hellenic Army General Staff, in its attempt to keep servicemen away from drugs, and


-----

participating in the general effort of the state to deal with the problem, pronounced 1997 as
the "Drugs Fighting Year", with a view to achieve the best possible results towards this
objective.

For this reason, a co-ordinating committee, under the chairmanship of a Major General, has
been established in order to monitor to the development of the planned activities, and all
medical and scientific personnel of the army, relevant to this problem such as psychologists,
psychiatrists, sociologists, social workers, has been activated.

The following activities are in progress :

o lectures in all training centres and units, presented by specialist psychiatrists,
with parallel use of audio-visual aids.

will participate.

o Study for the establishment of a detoxication centre.

**2. THE SOCIAL CONTRIBUTION OF THE NAVY**

The Navy supports the state in its effort to protect the well-being of the country's population.
To this end, it has established a mechanism that encounters emergency situations caused by
natural, technological, or other reasons at peace or war.

The social contribution of the Navy is of great importance. Among its recent activities one can
distinguish:

_Humanitarian Aid_

The Navy, following a resolution for a humanitarian aid mission in Albania, transported a
large quantity of food, drugs and clothing to Aghioi Saranta, on 13 March with the minesweeper ATALANTI and on 19 March 1997 with the mine-sweeper ATALANTI and the
torpedo-boat CYCLON.
_Moreover, on March 14-15, 1997, the Hellenic Navy executed a special operation for_
_evacuation of Greek and foreign citizens from Albania as follows: the frigate AEGEON, the_
_Missile Boat KAVALOUDIS, the Torpedo Boat LEALAPS and the Minesweeper KLEIO_
_executed a fast, effective and safe operation and a great number (more than 300) of Greek_
_citizens, citizens from other European countries, as well as from China, were taken from_
_Dyrrachion._


-----

Finally, in the context of providing assistance to Albania from the end of November 1997 the
following activities of the Navy are in progress :

- A special committee inspected the naval bases at Dyrrachion and Aghioi Saranta.

- A special committee visited Aghioi Saranta to consider the capability/method of refloating
five (5) sunk torpedo boats.

- Training of Underwater Demolition Teams (UTD).

- A quantity of paint, as well as paint for the ship's bottom were sent for maintenance of
civilian ships; a sufficient quantity of clothing for the newly-enlisted seamen was also sent.

policy purposes and it has proceeded in manning this office.

In parallel, there are the properly manned Personnel Welfare Offices at the Admiralty and the
Poros Training Centre, where the drugs problem and, especially, that of drugs prevention are
of top priority.

**3. THE SOCIAL CONTRIBUTION OF THE AIR FORCE**

In combination with its operational mission and in the framework of its social mission, the Air
Force performs air evacuations of persons in need of urgent transportation using its transport
aircraft and helicopters.

The Air Force thus contributes to the general effort of the state to protect and provide
confidence and security to the population, showing that the Armed Forces are on their side
when needed and provide the best assistance possible.


-----

The Air Force performed in 1996 and 1997 a series of air evacuation missions with C-130
aircraft and helicopters from the mainland and insular Greece for 530 patients.

The Air Force takes over relief missions for persons at risk, due to various reasons, as
assigned to it by the Search - Rescue Co-ordination Centre. For this reason, it has deployed at
eight (8) suitably selected sites, search and rescue aircraft and helicopters, which, during 1996
and 1997, executed a great number of missions.

**Public Agencies Air Service Unit**

The mission of the Public Agencies Air Service Unit, established by HAFGS, is to provide
aircraft, helicopters and personnel for aerial activities of the Ministry of Agriculture. It
constitutes a significant contribution of the Armed Forces in fighting various plant diseases
and, with direct positive effects in the increase of production and the protection of forests. The
Public Agencies Air Service Unit assists in forest fire extinguishing. During 1996 and 1997
the Public Agencies Air Service Unit sprayed a significant acreage. At the same time, using
the same aircraft, PZL type, it contributed to forest fire extinguishing.
