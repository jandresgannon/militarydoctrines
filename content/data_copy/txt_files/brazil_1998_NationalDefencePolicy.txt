# DEFENSE POLICY

##### 1. INTRODUCTION

 1.1 In the new international scene, full of challenges and opportunities, it is necessary to promote the development, in Brazil, of its own modes of flexible and creative strategic thinking, capable of meeting the defense needs of the country.

 1.2 The transformations that have occurred both domestically, as well as in the regional and global contexts, make it necessary and timely to formally issue a national defense policy, established at the highest level of the Government, which refletcs the aspirations of society and serves as a reference point for the strategies arising out of that policy.

 1.3 The National Defense Policy, which is aimed at threats from abroad, has as its primary purpose to establish the objectives for the defense of the Nation’s capabilities at every level and in every sphere of power, with the involvment of the military and civilian sectors.

 1.4 The National Defense Policy, a topic of interest to Brazilian society as a whole, is premised on the fundamental principles and objectives stipulated in the Federal Constitution, and is in harmony with the country’s international posture, which is based on seeking peaceful solutions to disputes and strengthening international peace and security.

 1.5 The dimensions of Brazil – simultaneously continental and maritime; equatorial, tropical and subtropical; sharing extensive land borders with almost all the countries in South America, as well as lengthy coasts; an exclusive economic zone and a continental shelf – endow the Nation with a geostrategic depth and complicates the task of overall defense planning. Brazil’s broad demographic and territorial characteristics, as well as the availability of natural resources, set firmly upon its diversified physical geography, generate a variety of scenarios that call for a comprehensive and integrated policy, along with a specific approach for each instance.

 1.6 The implementation of a sustainable defense policy, with the aim of gradually modernizing self-defense capabilities, will depend upon the construction of a development model that strengthens democracy, reduces both social inequalities and regional imbalances, and establishes priorities in the political, social and economic and military sectors compatible with defense and foreign policy requirements.

 1.7 In the process, defense needs should be adjusted to match the availability of resources, by means of the approval of funds by the National Congress and, whenever possible, with the involvment of the country’s academic, scientific, technological and i d t i l t

SITUATION

# DEFENSE POLICY

##### 2. THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION

 2.1 With the end of the East – West confrontation, in the current process of rearrangement of forces, an uncertain and unstable multipolar international scenario has emerged, engendered by the lack of correlation among the centers of strategic, military, political and economic power, the future evolution of which remains difficult to predict.

 2.2 The end of the Cold War has rendered obsolete the simplistic generalization arising out of the ideologically and militarily bipolar system which had prevailed until then. Currently, despite the reduction in the risks of a worldwide nuclear confrontation, a certain degree of strategic predictability is no longer feasible.

 2.3 Local conflicts, which are now occurring on almost every continent, the resurgence of ethnic, nationalist and religious extremism, as well as the phenomenon of fragmention which is now seen in many countries, make it clear that the traditional concepts such as sovereignty, self-determination and national identity continue to be important.

 2.4 During this transitional phase, as new rules of political and economic coexistence between nations are being established, characterized by the absence of clear paradigms and by the growing participation of non-governmental actors, Brazil strives to establish its strategic role and its priorities in the area of defense, free from any ideological model.

 2.5 The panorama of uncertainties that characterizes the current global situation mandates that the defense continues to require diligence by national governments, and, also, that the aspect of military power continues to be of utmost importance to the survival of nation-states as independent entities. It is not realistic to imagine a nation- state of reasonable size and international influence that could forgo having a dependable defense force. The armed forces constitute an instrument for the exercise of the right to self-defense, a right, moreover, which is enshrined in the United Nations Charter.

 2.6 South America, far from the focal points of global tension, is considered to be the most demilitarized region in the world. The re-democratization that has taken place in the Americas has tended to reduce the likelihood of conflicts. Regional disputes have been managed at tolerable levels.

 2.7 For Brazil, a country of different regions and a diversified profile – belonging simultaneously to the Amazon, Atlantic, Southern Cone, and Plata river basin –, the notion of regional space extends beyond the continental landmass of South America, also including the South Atlantic.

##### demanding a multifaceted regional role, based on a policy of harmonization of interests.

 2.9 Brazil has not been involved in a conflict with any of its neighbours for over a century, and it has worked to promote greater integration and closer relations among the nations in the Americas and, consequently, has gained international credibility.

 2.10 The strengthening of the integration process provided by Mercosur, the increasingly close relations with our neighbours in the Amazon region – developed within the scope of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty – the increased cooperation with the Portuguese- speaking African countries and the consolidation of the South Atlantic Zone of Peace and Cooperation – the result of a positive and concrete diplomatic action – have formed a veritable ring of peace around the country, making it possible to concentrate efforts to achieve a national strategy for development and for overcoming social inequalities.

 2.11 The country is not, however, totally free from risks. Despite its peaceful coexistence in the international community, it may be forced to become involved in conflicts originating elsewhere, due to threats to Brazil’s national heritage or vital interests.

 2.12 In the regional framework, there continues to be zones of instability that can threathen Brazilian interests. The actions of armed groups that are active in neighbouring countries, on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon, as well as international organized crime, are amongst the points that cause concern.

 2.13 Military capabilities and diplomacy are manifestations of national sovereignty and dignity, and Brazil has demonstrated in a clear and consistent manner its determination to live in peace and harmony in accordance with the principles and norms of international law, fully respecting the commitments it has taken on.

# DEFENSE POLICY

##### 3. OBJECTIVES

 3.1 From an examination of the circumstances described above emerges the need to devise specific strategic priorities arising out of the national interest and fundamental national defense objectives.

 3.2 Despite the favorable state of affairs in Brazil’s immediate environs, a defense system adequate to safeguard the Nations’s sovereignty, democracy and the rule of law should be maintained. That is the purpose of formulating a National Defense Policy, with resources to implement it, that integrates the strategic aims in the social, economic, military and diplomatic spheres, and which can count on endorsement by the Nation.

 3.3 The National Defense objectives are:

 a) to guarantee sovereingty while preserving the Nation’s territorial integrity, heritage and interests;

 b) to guarantee the rule of law and the democratic institutions;

 c) to maintain the Nation’s cohesion and unity;

 d) to protect individuals, goods, resources that are Brazilian, or under Brazilian jurisdiction;

 e) to achieve and maintain Brazilian interests abroad;

GUIDANCE

# DEFENSE POLICY

##### 4. STRATEGIC GUIDANCE

 4.1 The scope of Brazil’s actions in the area of defense is based on the obligation to provide security for the Nation, both during peacetime and in a situation of conflict.

 4.2 With this in view, the National Defense Policy is built around an active diplomacy devoted to peace, as well as a deterrent strategic posture, defensive in nature, based on the following principles:

G borders and boundaries that are precisely defined and internationally recognized;

G close relationships, based on mutual respect and trust, with neighbouring
##### countries and with the international community in general;

G rejection of war of conquest; and

G peaceful resolution of disputes, with resort to the use of force only for self##### defense.

 4.3 The preventive aspect of Brazilian defense rests both on the high value given to diplomatic actions as the first tool to resolve disputes and also on the existence of a sound military structure that is capable of being effectively deterrent.

 4.4 The defensive nature of the National Defense Policy does not imply that, in the event of conflict, the Armed Forces would have to be strictly limited to conducting defensive operations. In the context of a broader defense plan, and for the purpose of repelling a possible armed attack, Brazil will employ all the necessary military power, with the aim of concluding the conflict in the shortest possible time and with the minimum possible damage to the national interests and integrity and imposing favorable conditions for the re-establishment of peace.

 4.5 It is essential to strengthen, in a balanced manner, the national capabilities in the area of defense, with the involvment of the industrial, university, scientific and technical sectors. Scientific and technological development is fundamental for the Armed Forces to attain greater strategic autonomy and better operational capabilities.

 4.6 Military power should be based upon the capabilities of the Armed Forces and on the potential of national resources and the ready reserves, with the purpose of preventing any possible intent to defy the rules of peaceful coexistence between nations. The Armed Forces must be well-suited to the political and strategic nature of the Nation and structured, in a flexible and versatile manner, to take action promptly and effectively in different areas and scenarios.

Toward that end, it is essential to persevere in continuously improving the integration of the Armed Forces, in both their preparedness and employment, as well as in the rationalization of the related activities.
