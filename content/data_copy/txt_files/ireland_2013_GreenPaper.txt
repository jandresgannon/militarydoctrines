## Ministerial Foreword

There have been significant changes in the defence and security environment since the first White
Paper on Defence was published in 2000. I believe that the development of a new White Paper on
Defence will benefit greatly from a wide, inclusive and informed debate on the defence and security
challenges facing Ireland and how we should respond to those challenges.

The Green Paper sets out the changes that have occurred in the defence and security environment
since 2000 and the State’s policy response. It includes an assessment of likely future challenges
and sets out a number of policy focused questions for consideration.

I hope that this Green Paper will stimulate a broad and informed debate about Ireland’s future
Defence policy, a debate that will contribute to the preparation of a new White Paper that sets out a
balanced and practical Defence policy framework for the next decade.

## 1. Introduction

The goal of this Green Paper is to initiate and inform a broad consultative process, which will in turn
inform the development of a new White Paper on Defence. This new White Paper on Defence will
be completed early in 2014 and will set out Ireland’s Defence policy framework for the next decade.

**DEFENCE VISION**

This Green Paper provides an opportunity to develop a new vision for Defence and Defence policy
taking account of the current and evolving environment. The vision for Defence must take account
of a range of influences:

 - The fundamental importance of Defence within the policies pursued by Government on behalf
of the Irish people.

 - Ireland’s obligations in the context of the international order, international agreements and the
rule of law.

 - Democratic control, civil oversight and strategic management of Defence, including professional
military advice.

 - The emerging defence and security environment and the complex nature of existing threats to
security, such as those posed by international and cyber terrorism.

 - The economic context and the availability of resources for defence.

 - Political, social and other factors which bear on the conduct of defence.

Each country has its own unique approach to its defence and security. In Ireland, the approach is
a product of a range of factors including, among others, our history, our policy of military neutrality,
our commitment to the United Nations and our membership of the European Union. This Green
Paper seeks to maintain and give expression to an active vision of our neutrality, which includes a
willingness to project Irish values and priorities, including the promotion and preservation of peace,
disarmament, human rights, and support for humanitarian operations through the development and
deployment of the Defence Forces.

All of these factors combine to give a distinctly Irish vision of Defence and how it should sit within
broader public policy. Ireland’s approach to security is underlined by its engagement in EU Common
Security and Defence Policy together with other EU Member States and its strong support for the
deployment of the Defence Forces to international peace support and crisis management operations
as a means to protect and defend the vulnerable, particularly where the humanitarian role is manifest.
Ireland has never had a conscripted military force and, therefore, approaches to recruitment, training
and the relationship of the Defence Forces within wider society is different to many other countries.
Again in contrast to many countries, Ireland has a predominantly unarmed police force, the Garda
Síochána, and as a result the Defence Forces provide internal security supports of an on-going and
contingent variety.


-----

**OBJECTIVES OF THE GREEN PAPER**

This Green Paper provides the opportunity to update the vision for Defence while keeping faith
with those elements of continuing relevance in the Irish context. In this regard, the objectives of this
Green Paper are as follows:

 - To stimulate an open, mature and wide ranging consultative process to update the approach to
Defence as a follow-on to the 2000 White Paper;

 - In updating Ireland’s approach, to reflect the changes that have taken place in the international
and domestic defence, security and economic environments;

 - To give appropriate underpinning to Ireland’s engagement in international bodies particularly
the United Nations and the European Union;

 - To configure Defence policy in ways which reflect these foregoing matters and to provide
appropriate flexibility in the period ahead to take account of on-going changes to the defence
and security environment;

 - To ensure that the stated roles of the Defence Forces are consistent with requirements;

 - To guide and underpin decisions relating to the capacity of the Defence Organisation to include
resourcing, corporate skills, organisation, force composition and equipment acquisition over the
next ten years, building on recent reorganisation measures for the Permanent Defence Force
and the Reserve Defence Force;

 - To sustain and develop the Defence Organisation as one in which people are proud to serve;

 - To ensure Defence policy contributes in a congruent way with wider social and economic policy
to achieve national recovery.

The views that members of the public and other interested parties submit as part of this consultation
process will represent a key aspect of the White Paper policy formulation process. All members of the
public and public interest groups are encouraged to consider this important aspect of Government
policy and fully contribute to this process.

Submissions should be made in writing by e-mail to whitepaper@defence.ie or by post to:

## 2. Overview and Policy Questions

### 2.1 Defence and Security

Ireland has social, political, economic and cultural values and interests that define us as a nation
and that we wish to promote and defend. Ireland also has a world view, and proactively engages in
addressing the collective global challenges of preserving peace and security and defending human
rights.

The purpose of Defence policy is to provide security, and providing for the military defence of the
territorial integrity of the State is a key responsibility that is vested specifically in the Department of
Defence and the Defence Forces. Thankfully the threat of inter-state war in Europe is diminished.
However, the changed defence and security environment has demands that differ from those of
the past. The concept of security has continued to develop over recent decades and there is an
acceptance in most nations that threats to national security are much broader than those of interstate conflict. As the concept of security has broadened, so too have the implications for Defence
policy.

In Ireland, the domestic security environment has required that the Defence Forces are tasked
with fulfilling a broader security role, in particular in support of An Garda Síochána in protecting the
internal security of the State. The provision of a high level of domestic security support differentiates
Ireland’s Defence Forces from those of many States who utilise alternative forces apart from police
or Defence Force to undertake such functions. The Defence Forces provide a “surge” capacity that
enables the State to provide for additional security requirements. In addition, the Defence Forces
retain flexible military capabilities that can be utlised in a wide range of support roles and for crisis
situations. Ireland has also supported the maintenance of international peace and security through
deploying contingents of the Defence Forces on overseas peace support and crisis management
operations. Support for the United Nations (UN) has been a key part of our foreign policy. Ireland’s
current Defence policy encompasses these broader security issues.

A key role of the civil element of the Department of Defence is to support the Minister for Defence as
head of the Department and in particular to provide policy advice and support on Defence matters.
This includes providing assistance with policy formulation and the implementation of policy as
directed by the Minister.

Security is a whole of Government concern and as Ireland’s Defence policy encompasses
broader security issues than territorial defence, there is a requirement for significant cross-cutting
policy collaboration. Officials from the Department of Defence work alongside colleagues from
the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in international fora and provide key inputs into the
development of the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy. Officials from the Department also
liaise extensively with other Government Departments and agencies in the framing of appropriate
policy responses.

This Green Paper considers new and emerging security threats that Defence policy must address
appropriately, having regard to roles and responsibilities that rest with other Departments and
agencies such as the Department of Justice and Equality, An Garda Síochána, the Department of
the Taoiseach, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Revenue, etc.

### 2.2 Changes since the White Paper on Defence (2000)

Historically, there was a marked reluctance to formulate a specific Defence policy for the State.
Remarkably, the White Paper on Defence, published in 2000, was the first ever in the history of the
State. It has provided the policy framework for Defence over the last thirteen years. Chapter 3 of this
Green Paper outlines this policy framework. Chapter 4 traces the changes in the domestic, regional
and global defence and security environment and tracks associated policy responses. Chapter 5
considers other roles assigned to the Defence Forces. Together these chapters explain the current
Defence policy position.

There has been significant change in the Defence and Security environment since the publication
of the White Paper on Defence in 2000. The Defence Forces remain a key contributor within the
domestic security architecture and continue to provide a broad range of specialised operational
outputs both in Aid to the Civil Power and for other roles, including, inter alia, maritime patrols by
both the Naval Service and Air Corps. Changes in the approach to emergency planning, has seen
the establishment of the Office of Emergency Planning which supports the Government Taskforce
on Emergency Planning.

Globally and regionally, the last decade has seen an increased emphasis on collective security, which
reflects the evolution of threats in the defence and security environment. This collective security
requirement has been reflected in defence and security environment assessments from the UN
and in the European Union’s (EU) 2003 European Security Strategy (ESS). These threats include:
terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, regional conflicts, state failure, organised
crime, cyber security, energy security, climate change and piracy. Ireland has proactively engaged
in the collective security response through the UN, the EU and NATO Partnership for Peace (PfP).

The development of the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and its Common Security
and Defence Policy (CDSP) both underscore the Union’s emphasis on a comprehensive approach;
that is the ability to deploy the wide range of political, diplomatic, economic and military instruments
at its disposal to address complex security challenges. This has been supported by institutional
developments within the EU all of which have been underpinned by the ratification of successive
EU treaty reforms. Through this evolution, Ireland continues to play a full role in both the CFSP and
CSDP.

### 2.3 Defence and Security Realities

Chapter 6 presents an assessment of the future defence and security environment and the following
conclusions can be drawn:

 Ireland has real security concerns and interests, arising both domestically and internationally.
The boundaries between the internal and external aspects of security are becoming increasingly
blurred.

 Domestically, the Defence Organisation remains a key constituent of the security and defence
architecture. The Defence Forces also provide a range of other services to Government on a
day-to-day basis.

 Globalisation has transformed the sources and nature of security threats. Borders and geographic
location no longer provide the same degree of protection as in the past.


-----

 It is universally accepted that no one country acting alone can adequately respond to the new
security challenges. Co-operative and collaborative security arrangements are deepening and
Ireland must remain an active participant in the evolving collective security response.

 Ireland has a practical as well as a principled interest in participation in UN mandated peace
support operations. Our active participation has underpinned our ability to influence broader
policy developments in the EU and UN.

### 2.4 Policy Intent

The Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are a constituent part of the security and
defence architecture that the State employs in protecting the citizens of the State and our values
and interests. The intention is that Ireland will continue to confront pragmatically the threats in the
defence and security environment. We will seek to address the challenges of the future domestic and
international environment in a manner that supports our strategic interests, including the economic
and social development of Ireland, and that continues our constructive participation in the realm of
international peace and security.

In this, Ireland will continue to advocate a strong and effective United Nations; to play an active role
in peace support operations; and to support efforts towards UN reform. Ireland is committed to the
security cooperation that is necessary in order to underpin the political, economic and social wellbeing of the EU, which has been underpinned by the ratification of successive EU treaties. Ireland
is strongly committed to remaining at the heart of Europe and will continue to work on the full range
of policy priorities in the EU, including security and defence.

### 2.5 The Resource Challenge and Implications for Capability

Determining the optimal capabilities, having regard to the future defence and security environment
and allocated resources, is a key Defence policy challenge. The linkage between Defence policy,
ensuring the capacity to deliver and Defence Forces’ operational outputs is reflected in the strategic
dimensions set out in the Department of Defence and Defence Forces Strategy Statement 2011-2014.
In order to ensure effective policy, capabilities and operational outputs, the civil and military elements
of the Defence Organisation must retain the capacity to effectively discharge their respective roles.

Military capability is a combination of equipment, personnel, training and education, infrastructure,
organisation, planning, leadership and military doctrine. The delivery of military capability requires the
combined efforts of the Defence Organisation, both civil and military. There is a long lead time in the
delivery of new military capability. The military capability of today is the result of policy and strategic
management decisions taken years ago. The equipment necessary to achieve military objectives
and to optimise the safety of personnel is increasingly technologically advanced and expensive.
This ranges from the personal protection equipment for individual soldiers to communications and
surveillance devices as well as weapons systems. The skill sets of personnel must also match this
new sophistication.

Future military capability must be appropriate to the demands presented by the evolving security
and defence environment. For example, responses to threats such as terrorism, drug smuggling
and organised crime are intelligence led and this remains a critical capability area. Future capability
must address the operational requirements of the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service at home
and overseas. Interoperability with sophisticated security partners will remain the cornerstone of
overseas peace support operations and this means that the Defence Forces must train and equip


-----

to NATO capability standards. NATO has become in effect the ISO[1] of the military world with regard
to capability standards. The Defence Forces must also retain the contingent capability to contribute
to the State’s response to non-military events or crises and an appropriate surge capacity for
deteriorations in the security environment, in their aid to the civil power and aid to the civil authority
roles.

The funding provided for Defence has been reduced in recent years as part of the programme of
correction in the national finances. Within this reduced resource envelope, resourcing the Defence
Forces’ front line operational capability has been prioritised. In this context, the Defence Forces
entered the current period of economic austerity with modern equipment. However, equipment and
platforms will depreciate in the normal manner and stocks will be consumed.

The percentage of Government expenditure allocated to Defence in Ireland is one of the lowest in
the EU. In the short term funding constraints may prevent us from making commitments or carrying
out activities which might be otherwise considered desirable when the Exchequer finances have
been put on a more sustainable footing. Within these resource parameters, maintaining existing
capability into the future will be challenging and require difficult decisions. In this context, new and
innovative ways of acquiring and retaining required capability and delivering operational outputs will
become increasingly essential. This is also challenging other EU Member States and amongst the
initiatives being advanced are: the pooling and sharing of equipment platforms, joint development
partnerships with industry and new modes of procurement. New technology can also provide more
cost effective solutions in delivering required effects or outputs.

### 2.6 Military Neutrality

This Green Paper outlines the reality of the required collective security response to the new security
and defence environment and the continued requirement for Ireland’s engagement in that response.
The involvement of the Defence Forces in this collective response and deeper international
collaboration and cooperation will be the hallmark of security and defence into the future.

Ireland’s policy of military neutrality has been respected within the EU’s Common Foreign and
Security Policy, as has been the defence and security policies of the other EU countries. As outlined
in subsequent chapters, the EU Treaties clearly confirm the sovereign right of Member States to
decide how much to spend on defence and how, where and when to use their Defence Forces. In
addition, the Constitution provides clarity regarding Ireland’s position should the EU wish to propose
a “common defence”. Therefore all of the defence participation and activity, outlined in this Green
Paper, has a clear legislative and policy basis.

Ireland’s traditional policy of military neutrality has its origins in the country’s declared neutrality
during the Second World War. Against this background, but for other reasons as well, a decision was
taken in 1949 not to join the newly created North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). The State’s
policy of remaining outside military alliances has remained in place ever since. We must now look to
the future. Our traditional policy of military neutrality was formed in an era when the risk of inter-state
conflict was the key issue of national security for most nations. However, the current broad range of
threats does not fall into this category and military neutrality is immaterial for threats that are generic
and transnational in character e.g., cyber-security or terrorism.

The security threats and collective response are such that military capabilities are frequently

evolved a role as the standard setting organisation for military forces generally. NATO standards have been adopted by
a wide range of countries including Sweden, Switzerland, Finland and Austria.


-----

utilised for tasks that are not defined as “national defence”. Transnational and cross organisational
collaboration is required with regard to these generic and transnational threats. A concrete example
was the successful operation “Seabight” which intercepted drug smugglers at sea and included
international intelligence, police, Revenue and Naval Service and Air Corps collaboration.

There is a requirement for policy clarity with regard to the military contribution to the response to
collective security, which recognises the limitations of military neutrality as a policy response to these
broader threats. While Defence remains an area for sovereign decision, EU Member States, and in
particular other non-NATO members, have found it possible to progress actively the collaborative
response to the changed security environment.

### 2.7 Overseas Deployments and the “Triple Lock”

The approval procedures that govern the despatch of contingents of the Permanent Defence
Force on overseas peace support operations, commonly known as the “triple lock”, comprise three
requirements namely:

 - the authorisation of the operation by the Security Council or General Assembly of the United
Nations;

 - a formal Government decision; and

 - the approval of Dáil Éireann[2].

The legislative basis for the participation by the Permanent Defence Force in overseas peace
support operations as part of an “International United Nations Force” was originally provided for by
the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1960. The legal provisions were updated in 1993 to permit
participation in Chapter VII[3] missions and again in 2006 to take account of developments in peace
support including the UN’s increased reliance on regional organisations, such as the EU, NATO
and the African Union (AU). The requirements of the “triple lock” were formally set out in Ireland’s
national declaration associated with the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty.

The requirement for a UN resolution as part of the “triple lock” reflects the central importance of the
UN in granting legitimacy to peace support and crisis management missions. At the same time, it also
constitutes a self imposed, legal constraint on the State’s sovereignty in making decisions about the
use of its armed forces. This could prevent the State from participating in a peace support operation.
In 2003, the EU led peace support mission EUFOR Concordia in Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia, was welcomed in UN resolution 1371 in terms that did not conform to the requirements
of the Defence Acts at that time. Accordingly, Ireland could not participate in the mission.

The benefits of a formal legislative requirement for UN authorisation must be weighed against the
possibility that this constraint may lead to an inability to act on occasions where there is a pressing
moral or security imperative and overwhelming international support to do so, but where UN sanction
is not forthcoming, in circumstances where a veto is exercised by a permanent member of the
Security Council acting in its own national interests.

2 There is no requirement for Dáil approval where, the international United Nations Force is unarmed, where the size of
the Permanent Defence Force contingent does and will not exceed twelve members, or if the contingent is intended to
replace in whole or in part or reinforce a contingent of the PDF serving outside of the State already serving as part of an
International United Nations Force.
3 Under Chapter VII of the UN Charter (entitled “Action with respect to threats to the Peace, Breaches of the Peace and
Acts of Aggression”), the UN Security Council is mandated to take whatever action “as may be necessary to maintain or
restore international peace and security”. UN mandated operations mounted under this Chapter are commonly known
as “peace enforcement” operations.


-----

It is acknowledged that there is substantial public support for the triple lock mechanism and that,
in practical terms, due to the size of our Defence Forces, the State only has a limited capacity to
contribute to UN Missions. In real terms Ireland has, in the context of its size, punched above its
weight and made a valuable, disproportionate contribution and, save for the example of the Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, has not been excluded from peace keeping engagements by the
triple lock. On balance, the advantages of retaining the mechanism can be seen as outweighing the
disadvantages. Having said that, it is an issue worthy of discussion in advance of the adoption of a
new White Paper.

### 2.8 Policy Questions

The central challenge presented by this Green Paper is to consider the changed security paradigm
together with our understanding of military neutrality and to plot a pragmatic way ahead. Key policy
questions in this regard are:

**_Apart from the security challenges set out in this Green Paper, are there additional security_**
**_concerns that should be considered?_**

**_Do the advantages to the State in retaining the triple lock, in particular in ensuring the_**
**_international legitimacy of peace keeping missions, outweigh any possible disadvantages?_**

**_What will be the operational demands on the Defence Forces in future years and do the_**
**_roles currently assigned to the Defence Forces reflect these future requirements?_**

**_What capabilities does the Defence Organisation need for the period ahead including_**
**_corporate skills, force composition, equipment platforms, etc. and how can we best_**
**_prioritise our resources on human capital and equipment procurement?_**

**_What options should be pursued in acquiring the capabilities required e.g. should the_**
**_pooling and sharing of equipment platforms be considered?_**

**_How can Ireland’s traditional policy of military neutrality be dovetailed with increasing_**
**_requirements for Defence participation in collective security cooperation?_**

**_How can Defence further contribute to economic recovery e.g. options for increased_**
**_engagement with Irish Industry?_**

## 3. The White Paper on Defence (2000)

The publication of the State’s first ever White Paper on Defence in 2000 represented a major
landmark in formulating Defence policy. Prior to this the reticence about addressing fundamental
questions about the purpose and role of the Defence Forces constituted a major impediment to the
modernisation and development of the Defence Organisation[4]. In the decade since its publication,
the Defence Organisation has been transformed and the reform programme undertaken by the
Department and the Defence Forces as a result of the White Paper is widely regarded as a role
model for the public service. Because of its seminal importance, any background discussion of
Defence policy in Ireland must include a review of the White Paper.

### 3.1 Domestic Security

The White Paper on Defence noted that the threats to the security of the State which required an
operational response from the Defence Forces in the preceding thirty years, had all been in the
internal security domain, where the Defence Forces provided critical input in an aid to the civil power
(ATCP) role.

It noted the improvements to the on-island security situation arising from the Good Friday agreement.
The security situation in Northern Ireland and on the Border had been transformed with the continuing
ceasefires on the part of the main republican and loyalist paramilitary groups and the beginning
of normalisation of security arrangements. It noted that dissident republican paramilitary groups
represented the greater threat to the security of the State. However, the overall dangers to security
were considered to be of “a considerably lower order than was the case prior to the ceasefires”.

However, it outlined that there would be a continued requirement for Defence Forces personnel
to provide a broad range of support in the ATCP role, including cash escorts, and the provision of
military security at Portlaoise prison. The requirement for an effective Explosive Ordnance Disposal
(EOD) capacity in order to deal with a broad range of contingencies was emphasised.

### 3.2 Global and Regional Security

The White Paper on Defence considered defence responses to the changing defence and security
environment. It concluded that Ireland approached Defence provision on the basis of a generally
benign security environment and that the external security environment did not contain any specific
threats to the overall security of the State[5].

Analysis of the defence and security environment at that time indicated that _“national security_
_has evolved beyond the narrow role of territorial defence towards issues of conflict prevention,_
_peacekeeping and crisis management”[6] and that a broad concept of security had emerged in all of_
the European and Euro-Atlantic institutions including the EU.

Trends in the international peace support environment highlighted an increase in the number of
conflict situations for which a peace support operation was an element of the solution and in some
cases the most important element. In addition, the UN was increasingly mandating peace support
operations by regional organisations on its behalf. A greater demand for international peace support

6 White Paper on Defence (2000) section 3.2.2


-----

operations in internal conflict situations had brought new levels of complexity, often involving difficult
and historically charged situations created by ethnic tensions and disputes[7]. In this context, defence
concepts had evolved focussing on rapidly deployable forces.

The White Paper confirmed that Ireland’s commitment to collective security is pursued through the
United Nations, which has the primary role to play in the maintenance of international peace and
security[8]. The moral imperative for such engagement in maintaining international peace and security
is a given and Ireland has consistently contributed to the fullest extent possible. However, the White
Paper also acknowledged that: _“Ireland is a small country with a limited capacity to influence its_
_external environment. We have a practical as well as a principled interest in the maintenance of_
_international peace and security in Europe and further afield. Our defence policy will seek to reflect_
_this strategic interest.” [9]_

The White Paper also acknowledged the evolution of the response to threats to international peace
and security. It noted, in the context of the experiences of regional conflicts such as in Kosovo and
Bosnia and Herzegovina, that increasingly proactive and preventive approaches encompassing a
range of coordinated techniques - e.g. diplomatic, humanitarian, policing and military, - in the form
of regional peacekeeping and crisis management were seen as necessary to ensure stability and
defend against threats to security in the European sphere.[10]

It emphasised the fact that such multi-faceted challenges to security were beyond the capacity
of individual states and noted that a web of mutually reinforcing security cooperation, involving
an increasing number of countries, including neutral States, was developing in the Euro-Atlantic
area. This security interdependence had played a role in reducing the risk of war between states in
Europe and involved the UN, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the
EU, NATO and the Western European Union[11] (WEU).

The White Paper re-iterated that Ireland’s participation in any EU military operation would only arise
where a UN mandate was present. It also concluded that Ireland’s participation in this emerging
environment was “an important element of Ireland’s capacity to influence events in a way which was
_sensitive to this country’s needs and consonant with Ireland’s military neutrality”.[12]_

### 3.3 Policy Requirements

Based on the then assessment of the defence and security environment, the White Paper on Defence
outlined the following policy requirements for Defence. It states: [13]

“Having regard to the defence and security environment, the Government’s policy for defence will be
aimed at ensuring that the following requirements are met:

 - To maintain a military force structure that provides a basis for responding to any major change
in Ireland’s strategic circumstances in the medium to long term, as well as demonstrating an
appropriate commitment to national defence.

13 White Paper on Defence (2000) section 4.2.1


-----

 - To maintain a military force structure capable of responding to requests to provide aid to the
civil power and in that context, contributing to the prevention of security challenges from abroad
including terrorism and arms smuggling.

 - To fulfil Ireland’s international and regional responsibilities arising from membership of the UN
by providing a range of military capabilities that can effectively be employed to participate in a
broad range of multinational peace support and humanitarian relief operations.

 - To demonstrate Ireland’s commitment to European security by having a suitable range of military
capabilities that can be used to make appropriate contributions to regional security missions
authorised by the UN.”

### 3.4 Roles assigned to the Defence Forces

Unlike many other countries, Ireland’s military capabilities are not retained exclusively for national
defence contingencies or overseas missions. The outputs of the Defence Organisation form an
integral part of a multidimensional defence, security and support framework.

In addition to the security roles, the White Paper on Defence recognised that Defence Forces
capabilities and resources were utilised in a broader range of roles including, inter alia, fishery
protection, assisting the civil authorities in response to major emergencies, natural disasters and
in the maintenance of essential services. The White Paper recommended the development of
Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) or Service Level Agreements (SLA) with other Government
Departments and Agencies as a means of formalising the provision of Defence Forces outputs.

The Roles assigned to the Defence Force in the White Paper reflect all of these requirements and
were as follows: [14]

 - to defend the State against armed aggression; this being a contingency, preparations for its
implementation will depend on an ongoing Government assessment of the security and defence
environment;

 - to aid the civil power (meaning in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda Síochána, who
have primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of
the State);

 - to participate in multinational peace support, crisis management and humanitarian relief
operations in support of the United Nations and under UN mandate, including regional security
missions authorised by the UN;

 - to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State’s obligations as a member
of the EU; and

 - to carry out such other duties as may be assigned to them from time to time, e.g. search and
rescue, air ambulance service, Ministerial air transport service, assistance on the occasion of
natural or other disasters, assistance in connection with the maintenance of essential services
and assistance in combating oil pollution at sea.

### 3.5 Capability Framework

The development of military capability requires the combined efforts of the Defence Organisation,
both civil and military. Military capability is much broader than equipment platforms and it has a
number of dimensions, which are interrelated and all of which impact on the ability to achieve
operational success. Capability results from combining human resources, planning, modern
equipment, infrastructure, military organisation, training and education, leadership and military
doctrine. It requires the retention of a range of professional skills and the ability to effectively deploy
appropriately trained and equipped personnel. In particular, operations must be sustainable i.e.
enough personnel to rotate as required and appropriate logistical support. This was reflected in the
White Paper on Defence (2000).

Key capability decisions included in the White Paper were:

 - The retention of a Permanent Defence Force of 10,500 personnel organised along conventional
military lines.

 - A light infantry based Army with a three Brigade structure and an appropriate level of all arms
capability.

 - Development of the Naval Service around a modern 8 ship flotilla.

 - Development of the Air Corps based on its existing role profile.

 - Development of a re-organised Reserve Defence Force.

In this context, a key element of the development strategy outlined in the White Paper was the rebalancing of resources to achieve an organisation that could be sustained on the available budget.
This required a reduction in the number of personnel and greater investment in equipment and
infrastructure. A reduction in the Permanent Defence Force strength ceiling from 11,500 personnel
to 10,500 personnel was an essential enabler in re-balancing the resource allocation towards the
recommended 70:30 pay to non-pay ratio.

## 4. Key developments since the White Paper

There are a number of inter-dependent dimensions to the evolution of Ireland’s Defence policy in
the intervening period since 2000 and within the framework outlined in the White Paper on Defence.
These include changes in the defence and security environment, policy, capability and operational
responses to these changes and the resource envelope within which the Defence Organisation
must deliver capability and operational outputs.

Domestically, the Defence Forces remain a key constituent of the security architecture and have
continued their support roles across a range of aid to the civil power tasks including cash escorts,
prisoner escorts, explosive ordnance disposal, assistance with major security operations, etc.

Internationally the defence and security environment has undergone significant changes. For
Ireland, a key policy issue has been the developing responses by global and regional security
organisations with which Ireland acts in pursuit of collective security, principally the UN, the EU and
NATO/PfP. Cooperation within the EU has deepened and this has been underpinned by institutional
developments within the EU in accordance with successive Treaties to which Ireland has subscribed,
albeit with specific points of clarification.

These changes, in turn, have informed required operational responses and associated capability
requirements. The EU and UN both acknowledge that a wide variety of responses are required in
order to deal with the security challenges that have emerged and that risk mitigation strategies must
address the complex multi-faceted causes of these threats. In this context, military capabilities are
but one of a range of instruments that can be brought to bear. However, this paper primarily focuses
on the Defence contribution to security.

Working to the framework provided by the White Paper, the transformation of the Defence
Organisation is recognised as having been a model of public service reform and modernisation.
Over the period 2000 to 2012, the gross provision allocated for Defence (Vote 36) increased by 7%
which represents a decline in real terms. This is in marked contrast to the overall increase in public
expenditure, which was approx 114% for the same period[15]. In addition the number of personnel
employed in the Defence Organisation is now 15% below that of 2000. This is in contrast to overall
public service numbers which are 20% greater than in 2000.

Together these changes have shaped the current position and they are considered in more detail in
the following sections.

### 4.1 Defence and Security Environment

**4.1.1 Domestic Security**

The Good Friday Agreement delivered a stable peace process that commands overwhelming
cross community support and led to a welcome transformation of the level of security threat posed
by paramilitary groups on both parts of the island. Nonetheless, so called ‘dissident’ republican
groups remained intent on disrupting the progress that has been achieved since the signing of the
agreement.

In recent years there has been a worrying development which has seen an increased use of
improvised explosive devices by criminals within the State. This has required an ongoing response
from Defence Forces EOD teams, which are maintained at high readiness to respond to such

15 http://databank.per.gov.ie/

incidents. This has required ongoing rotation of teams, the maintenance of high level technical skills
sets and the provision of specialist equipment and vehicles.

There has also been an ongoing requirement for a wide range of other Defence Forces supports
to an Garda Síochána. The Garda Síochána are predominantly unarmed and trained for policing
activities in a normal peaceful society although they have developed some armed and specialist
elements. The Defence Forces provide military personnel in an operational role in an aid to the civil
power (ATCP) capacity. The Defence Forces continue to provide cash escorts, prisoner escorts and
provide security at Portlaoise prison in addition to other supports such as to the Garda Air Support
Unit. In addition to the range of security supports provided daily, a Defence Forces contribution is
also required as part of the security provided for events of national importance such as visits by
heads of State and other VIPs.

Since the publication of the White Paper, the total area over which Ireland claims maritime sovereign
rights (to various degrees) has almost doubled and is now approximately 220 million acres extending
1,000km (over 600nm) into the North Atlantic. This represents a sea to land ratio in excess of 12:1
when compared to the land mass of the State. The Naval Service is the State’s principal seagoing agency and has continued to undertake a broad range of security tasks including ongoing
surveillance and patrolling of the State’s maritime domain. The Air Corps provides the air component
of the State’s maritime surveillance and patrolling capacity.

The Naval Service operates as part of the Joint Task Force on Drugs Interdiction (with an Garda
Síochána and Revenue). In this context, Ireland contributes to the Maritime Analysis and Operations
Centre – Narcotics (MAOC-N), which was established in 2007 as an international coordination
centre to provide a greater focus on intelligence exchange between its seven member countries
(i.e. Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Portugal and Italy) to tackle large
drug shipments by sea.

The Air Corps is also involved in this area to the extent that it provides air support to drug interdiction
operations and, on occasions, carries members of Revenue in an observational capacity for the
purpose of monitoring vessels suspected of drug trafficking and other illegal activities.

**4.1.1.1 Emergency Planning**

Following the events of September 11, 2001, emergency planning has been transformed. The
Government Task Force on emergency planning brings together all parts of government with a
lead or support role in Government emergency planning. The Office of Emergency Planning
(OEP) is a civil-military office within the Department of Defence, established to support the work
of the Government Task Force. The Office works with all departments and agencies involved in
emergency planning and it carries out a cross-departmental oversight function, which forms the
basis of a confidential Annual Report to Government. The most recent Report was for the period
1 October 2011 to 31 December 2012.

The National Emergency Coordination Centre, opened in 2007, provides a robust and resilient
facility for emergency planners involved in such a national response. The facilities put in place have
been utilised on a number of occasions. For example, during the severe weather events in 2009 and
2010 and during the volcanic ash crisis in March/April 2010. Throughout March and April 2011, the
Centre was used by the National Coordination Group formed to coordinate the impact and monitor
emerging issues arising from the earthquake in Japan and subsequent explosion of the nuclear
plant in Fukushima.


-----

**4.1.1.2 Civil Defence**

Since the publication of the White Paper on Defence (2000) the Civil Defence organisation has
continued to develop as a volunteer based high-quality second line emergency response service
in addition to continuing and developing its community support activities. This was supported by
investment and the modernisation of equipment such as off-road vehicles, boats and specialist
equipment.

The Civil Defence Act, 2002 provided for the establishment of the Civil Defence Board (a State
authority under the aegis of the Department of Defence), which was subsequently established in
2003. The Civil Defence Board managed the development of the Civil Defence organisation at
national level in the period to end 2012. In line with Government policy on the rationalisation of
State Agencies, the Civil Defence Act 2012 dissolved the Civil Defence Board and its functions were
reassigned to the Department of Defence.

The headquarters of Civil Defence was decentralised to a new facility in Roscrea, Co. Tipperary
in 2006. The Civil Defence College has been progressively developing training supports to the
organisation and is recognised as a training institution by a number of statutory and regulatory bodies
such as the Further Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC) and Pre-Hospital Emergency
Care Council (PHECC).

Civil Defence volunteers continue to provide ongoing supports to their communities and have played
a comprehensive role during the severe weather and flood related events of recent years. Civil
Defence is now very much integrated into emergency planning and response arrangements at
local, regional and national level in support of the frontline services under the Framework for Major
Emergency Management.

While the organisation at national level is managed and developed by the Department of Defence,
operational control at local level is the responsibility of the relevant local authority. In that regard the
ongoing local government reform programme will also inform the ongoing development of the Civil
Defence Organisation.

**4.1.2 Global and Regional Security**

The White Paper policy framework predates 9/11, the Iraq War, the war in Afghanistan, and the
Arab Spring. It also predates the accession of previous eastern European States as members of
the Union and members of NATO. Since its publication there have been other significant changes
internationally with countries such as China, India and Brazil evolving further and Russia continuing
its re-emergence.

During the intervening period, periodic formal assessments of the defence and security environment
have been included in Defence Statements of Strategy, at a minimum every three years. These
assessments are informed by both EU and UN assessments of the global and regional security
environment.

The European Security Strategy (ESS) was adopted by the EU Heads of State and Government in
2003. It identified that at that time the EU faced security threats “which are more diverse, less visible
and less predictable”. These threats included:

1. Terrorism.

2. Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction.

3. Regional Conflicts.


-----

4. State Failure.

5. Organised Crime.

The ESS reflects a holistic approach to the concept of European security and focuses on the EU’s
comparative advantage in the area of “soft power”[16]. It identified threats and established more
coherence in EU policy and among Member States in conflict prevention and crisis response,
including military capability.

In 2004, in recognition of the changed security environment, a report by the UN Secretary General’s
High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges, and Change entitled ‘A More Secure World: Our Shared
Responsibility’, emphasised the need for collective security and for security to be addressed at the
global, regional and national level. The report identifies six clusters of threats:

 - Economic and social, including poverty, infectious disease, and environmental degradation.

 - Interstate conflict.

 - Internal conflict, including civil war, genocide, and other large scale atrocities.

 - Nuclear, radiological, chemical and biological weapons.

 - Terrorism.

 - International organised crime.

A report on the implementation of the ESS was carried out by the EU’s then High Representative in
2008. The report concluded that the EU had made substantial progress over the five year period and
that the EU was recognised as an important contributor to a better world. The report also indicated
that the world was changing fast, with evolving threats e.g., cyber attacks, energy security, climate
change and piracy. It noted however, despite all that had been achieved, that implementation of the
ESS remained a work in progress and for the EU’s full potential to be realised the EU needs to be
still “more capable, more coherent and more active”.

The ESS concluded that none of the threats identified, e.g., terrorism, the proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction, regional conflicts, state failure and organised crime, are purely military. Nor can
any be tackled by purely military means. The response to each requires the application of a mixture
of civilian and military instruments. A key factor in the increased capacity of the EU to influence the
international security agenda is the comprehensive approach. That is the ability to deploy the wide
range of instruments at its disposal including military, economic, diplomatic and political. The Lisbon
Treaty facilitates the comprehensive approach.

### 4.2 Global and Regional Institutions

Global and regional institutions with which Ireland engages in pursuit of collective security, such as
the UN, the EU and NATO PfP, similar to many individual States, have evolved their approach to
security and defence in response to the acknowledged changes in the environment. The response
within the EU has of necessity been achieved through closer political cooperation and new institutional
structures arising from the ratification of successive treaties. Notable developments are set out
below.

16 The EU’s range of “soft power” instruments to utilise for conflict prevention, crisis management and peace promotion
purposes include political, diplomatic, economic, humanitarian, together with civil administration and military instruments.


-----

**4.2.1 UN Developments**

Discussion on reform of the UN, from the structure of the Security Council through to military
peacekeeping, is ongoing. In 2000 the Brahimi Panel captured the UN response to their much
criticised engagement in conflicts in Africa and the Balkans in the 1990s. Highlighting the changed
nature of conflicts, the report called for the capacity for a quick response to complex and volatile
situations far beyond traditional peacekeeping. Western nations in particular were called upon to
provide self-deploying, self-sustaining, quick reaction forces. The report recognised the requirement
for more Chapter VII peace enforcement operations and for UN operations to be capable of applying
credible coercive force. The policy changes arising from this report have been evident since 2000
with an increased reliance on regional organisations to lead peace support operations on behalf of
the UN. The EU, NATO and the African Union are now major players in UN peacekeeping.

**4.2.2 EU Developments**

Since the publication of the White Paper on Defence, the European Union has been further
strengthened through ratification of the Nice Treaty and the Lisbon Treaty. In order for Ireland to ratify
these treaties, constitutional amendments were required and on both occasions these amendments
were rejected in the first instance by the Irish electorate. One of the concerns raised by the electorate
related to the implications of ratification on Ireland’s defence and security policy.

On each occasion Ireland’s position was clarified and further underpinned in the declarations and
protocols attached to these EU Treaties. In addition, the constitutional amendment ratifying the Nice
Treaty in 2002 contained, inter alia, the following text:

_Article 29.4.9_
_The State shall not adopt a decision taken by the European Council to establish a common_
_defence pursuant to Article 1.2 of the Treaty referred to in subsection 7 of this section where that_
_common defence would include the State._

However, in 2008, concerns regarding Ireland’s defence and security policy were subsequently
cited[17] as one of the reasons for the initial rejection of the constitutional amendment in order to ratify
the Lisbon Treaty. The position with regard to the Lisbon Treaty was clearly set out in The White
Paper on the Lisbon Treaty[18] (2009) and similar to the Nice treaty, the treaty was also subsequently
ratified.

Ireland has and continues to engage positively with and influence the evolution of the Common
Foreign and Security Policy and the Common Security and Defence Policy of the EU.

**4.2.2.1 EU Defence and Security Policy Developments**

EU Member States have committed themselves to a Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP),
under which the Member States undertake to work together on international issues in mutual
political solidarity. The Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), which is a component of
the EU’s CFSP, aims to strengthen the Union’s external ability through the development of civilian
and military capabilities in crisis management and conflict prevention. The EU’s CFSP, under the
Treaty of Amsterdam (1997), encompassed a new role for the EU in the areas of humanitarian
and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including
peacemaking (collectively known as Petersberg tasks). It noted that this did not involve the creation
of a European Army.

18 White Paper on the Lisbon Treaty (2009) Pg.18.


-----

The decisions of the 1999 Cologne and Helsinki EU summits recognised the need for a collective
response to security challenges and the associated need for the EU to work towards a capability for
autonomous action. EU Member States set an agreed, voluntary target, known as a Headline Goal,
to improve capabilities for Petersberg Tasks, which they aimed to meet by 2003. This includes a
“pallette of forces”, to which Ireland contributes from within our UNSAS[19] commitment. A unanimous
decision of the Council is required to launch a “Crisis Management Task operation”.

During the Irish Presidency of the EU in 2004, the Battlegroups[20] concept was adopted and has
introduced the capability to deploy forces at high readiness. Since January 2007 two Battlegroups
are required to be on stand-by for a period of six months at a time. Ireland has participated in the
Nordic Battlegroup (2008 and 2011) and participated in the Austrian / German Battlegroup which was
on standby for the second six months of 2012. Ireland’s operational deployment with a Battlegroup
remains subject to the “triple lock” mechanism. To date, there has been no operational deployment
of an EU Battlegroup.

In May 2006, the EU Commission published “A Concept for European Community Support for Security
Sector Reform,” which notes the need for a holistic approach to Security Sector Reform (SSR) by
the EU. It also emphasised the need for cooperation with regional and multilateral organisations,
including the UN, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Council of
Europe, OSCE and the African Union (AU), in training and SSR support. The EU is engaged in SSR
related support in over 70 countries.

The importance of security to the social and economic development of communities and nations is
well recognised by the international aid community. Security from violence is a necessary condition
to achieve sustainable social, economic and political development. Similarly, for aid to be effective,
it is necessary to have a stable and secure environment in order to maximise its impact in terms of
development and growth.

Ireland has added value to participation in SSR activities. The Defence Forces have supported the
Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration (DDR) process in Liberia through the provision of
security for DDR teams at weapons sites. Between 2005 and 2006, they assisted in the weapons
decommissioning process in Indonesia, as part of the EU Monitoring Mission in Indonesia. Also, a
small contingent of Defence Force personnel are currently assisting in the training of the security
forces of the Somali Transitional Federal Government in the EU training Mission in Somalia. This
mission is being led by a General from the Defence Forces and has been acknowledged as a
significant success.

The EU is now a major player on the world stage with an increasing capacity to influence the
international security agenda using the instruments at its disposal including economic, diplomatic,
political and military instruments and this comprehensive approach is a hallmark of the CFSP.
The Nobel Peace Prize for 2012 was awarded to the European Union (EU) in recognition of the
contribution over six decades to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and
human rights in Europe.

19 A key element of Ireland’s contribution to international peace and security is the commitment of personnel to international
peace support operations (PSOs) under UN authority. Ireland is committed to provide up to 850 personnel under the
United Nations Standby System (UNSAS). From within this figure, Ireland has committed a palette of forces under the
Helsinki Headline Goal which requires the maintenance of a broad range of capabilities at varying readiness states.
20 The purpose of the EU Battlegroups is to provide a rapid level of response to developing international crises, allowing
the EU to intervene during the critical early stages or to reinforce an existing operation.


-----

**4.2.2.2 EU Institutional Developments**

The structures in the EU to support the CFSP have also evolved. The Political and Security Committee
(PSC) and the Military Committee (EUMC) bring together the diplomatic and military representatives
of the Member States. There is also an EU military staff supporting the planning and conduct of
operations and the development of capability. Ireland plays an active part in all of these committees
and institutions.

The European External Action Service (EEAS) was established on 1 December 2010; exactly
one year after the Lisbon Treaty came into force. The EEAS is staffed by diplomats from national
services and from the Council and the Commission. The EEAS has been fully operational since 1
January 2011. The EEAS serves as a foreign ministry and diplomatic corps for the EU. It assists
and is under the authority of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy who is
responsible for implementing the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy, and other areas of the
EU's external representation. The EEAS manages the EU's response to crises and cooperates with
the European Commission in areas with which it shares competence.

Expenditure related to the Common Foreign and Security Policy is charged to the EU budget, except
expenditure arising from operations having military and defence implications and cases where the
Council unanimously decides otherwise. The Heads of State and Government agreed in September
2003, on the arrangements for the payment of the costs of EU led military operations. Each State
contributes to the common costs of an operation using a Gross National Income (GNI) key and
Ireland’s contribution is just over 1% of these costs. In addition, Member States which contribute
personnel to an operation, pay for their operational costs on a “costs lie where they fall” basis. The
facility for a Member State to opt out of contributing to the common costs of an operation by means
of a formal declaration under Article 23(1) (“constructive abstention”) of the Treaty on European
Union has never been exercised.

**4.2.3 EU – UN Cooperation**

Driven by the need for effective responses to crises, cooperation between the EU and other
international actors, particularly the UN, in the area of crisis management, has developed substantially.
EU-UN cooperation is an important component of Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).
Both formal and operational interaction between the two organisations remains strong.

In this regard, Ireland developed a Food For Thought paper – Enhancing EU/UN Cooperation[21].
Following a consultation process between the EU’s Crisis Management and Planning Directorate
(CMPD) and the UN’s Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the European External Action
Service (EEAS) has produced an action plan which, had its origin in the Irish paper, setting out
actions which they believe will enhance EU-UN cooperation such as: - the EU providing a component
to a UN operation (civilian or military) and/or an EU autonomous military deployment in support of
UN operations.

**4.2.4 The EU and NATO**

Given that so many EU Member States are also part of NATO, the relationship between the EU and
NATO was foreseen from the outset of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), which was
formerly known as European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP). States demand that duplication
of effort and duplication of standards across the two organisations, and wasteful expenditure, is
avoided.

-----

Permanent arrangements between the EU and NATO have evolved in accordance with principles
specified by successive European Councils since Feira (Portugal) in 2000. These principles include
full respect for the autonomy of EU decision-making, recognition of the different natures of the EU
and NATO, and no discrimination against Member States of either organisation.

Following the enlargement of both organisations in 2004, and the subsequent accession of Bulgaria
and Romania to the EU in 2007, NATO and the EU now have 21 common member countries. The
cooperation mechanisms established include EU-NATO meetings at ambassadorial and ministerial
level, as well as regular meetings between the EU and non-EU European NATO members. This
structure facilitates consultations in the event of a crisis, and also permits non-EU NATO members
to contribute to EU-led operations. In 2002, the EU-NATO arrangement was formalised and in
March 2003, the “Berlin Plus”[22] arrangement was put in place which allows the EU to use NATO
assets and capabilities such as transport and headquarters, for substantial crisis management and
peacekeeping missions.

NATO’s Strategic Concept, which was adopted at the NATO Lisbon Summit in November 2010,
commits the Alliance to prevent crises, manage conflicts and stabilise post-conflict situations,
including by working more closely with NATO’s international partners, most importantly the UN and
the EU. The Strategic Concept clearly states that an active and effective EU contributes to the
overall security of the Euro-Atlantic area.

The EU and NATO share a strategic vision and operational ambitions. As both organisations cooperate
on issues of common interest and are working side by side in crisis-management operations, the
NATO Strategic Concept underlines the importance of improving the NATO-EU strategic partnership.
Close cooperation between NATO and the EU will remain an important element in the development
of an international “Comprehensive Approach” to crisis management and operations, which requires
the effective application of both military and civilian means.

### 4.3 Capability Development

The continued development of the Defence Organisation’s capabilities has been informed by Defence
policy developments and operational requirements, both domestic and international. Defence Forces
capabilities have been funded within a reducing resource envelope and significant organisational
reform and modernisation has been required in order to maintain the operational outputs of the
Defence Forces. This has been a key part of the Defence management response in order to ensure
the retention of appropriate capabilities. It has entailed the further closure of barracks, a major
reorganisation of the Defence Forces, both Permanent and Reserve, and the careful prioritisation of
equipment expenditure.

The civil and military elements of the Department of Defence work closely in managing, maintaining
and developing military capabilities. In addition to the policy and financial management functions,
the procurement of major equipment, management of the Department’s extensive infrastructure
and property holdings (including training lands), and the provision of appropriate HR and regulatory
frameworks are just some of the other key contributions of the Department of Defence to military
capability maintenance and development.

Major equipment holdings are outlined in Appendix 1.

22 “Berlin Plus” was originally outlined at the NATO Summit in Washington D.C. in 1999 (4th April – Article 10
Washington Summit Communiqué).


-----

**4.3.1 Economic Resources**

Defence expenditure has decreased in real terms over the period from 2000. The Defence
Organisation has downsized, infrastructure has been rationalised whilst outputs have improved in
qualitative and quantitative terms.

Defence vote expenditure (including pensions), as a percentage of overall gross Government
expenditure[23], has decreased from 2.9% in 2000 to 1.6% in 2010. Over the same decade, defence
expenditure as a percentage of Gross National Product (GNP) has decreased from 0.85% to 0.70%.
When measured as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), this equates to a decrease
from 0.7% to 0.6% over the same period.

Proportionately, defence expenditure in Ireland also remains amongst the lowest of EU Member
States[24]. In 2010 average defence expenditure across EU States, as a percentage of (GDP), was
1.6%, whilst Ireland’s rate of defence expenditure was 0.6%. This was second lowest within the EU
with only Luxembourg recording a lower percentage at 0.5%.

Defence provision includes the cost of developing and maintaining capability as well as the direct
cost of participation in overseas peace support operations. Where the mission is a UN led operation,
the UN reimburses the Exchequer with some costs in respect of contributions of personnel and
equipment. Rates of reimbursement, fixed in accordance with UN categories of equipment and
personnel, are agreed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Ireland and the UN for
each mission. The only mission, for which Ireland is currently entitled to reimbursement of some
troop and equipment costs, is the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).

The UN does not reimburse costs where the mission is one on which the UN has requested a regional
organisation to launch and manage the military operation on its behalf and under its authority. The
majority of the cost of participation in UN mandated operations led by regional organisations, i.e.,
EU, AU, falls on the Exchequer.

Within these reduced expenditure levels, maintaining outputs and capability has required a consistent
focus on delivering efficiencies. A key element of the White Paper in 2000 was the re-balancing of
pay to non-pay costs in order to ensure the required investment in equipment. The policy adopted by
Government of reinvestment of the proceeds of property sales (including barrack closures), allowed
for a progressive development of defence assets.

The White Paper on Defence reduced the strength of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) from
11,500 to 10,500 as the level necessary to fulfil Government policy on Defence provision. The
Permanent Defence Force was maintained at a level of 10,500 until the current economic difficulties
emerged. A revised strength ceiling of 10,000 PDF personnel was agreed with the Department of
Finance in October 2010. However, the actual numbers serving continued to fall below that level.
Following the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE) in 2011, the Government stabilised the
strength ceiling of the PDF at 9,500 personnel.

As the organisational structures which were in place for a strength level of 11,500 PDF personnel
were no longer viable for a strength ceiling of 9,500 PDF personnel, the Minister for Defence initiated
a reorganisation of the Defence Forces. In July, 2012, the Minister accepted the proposals for the
reorganisation which had been prepared by the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces and the Secretary

General of the Department of Defence. The recommendations outlined a PDF Army structure based
on two Brigades with the brigade headquarters located in Cork and Dublin. Other key aspects of
this reorganisation included the consolidation of under-strength Units and the disestablishment of
certain units, a reduction in the number of headquarters and a re-deployment of personnel from
administrative and support functions to operational Units. A reorganisation of the Reserve Defence
Force, within a revised strength ceiling of 4,069 personnel also commenced following the publication
of a Value for Money review of the Reserve in November 2012.

Since 2000, the Department of Defence has taken on additional responsibilities, from within reducing
resources, such as the Office of Emergency Planning (OEP) and an increased policy workload
arising from the development of European Security and Defence Policy.

**4.3.2 EU Capability Development**

The main priority in the area of the EU’s capability development planning is to provide the Union
with an operational capacity, drawing on civilian and military assets, which can be used on missions
outside the Union for peacekeeping, conflict prevention and strengthening international security in
accordance with the principles of the United Nations.

These efforts have been informed by the increased recourse to more robust UN Chapter VII missions
and the related development of associated standby arrangements such as EU Battlegroups. In that
context, the EU has agreed broad civilian and military capability objectives beyond 2010.

**4.3.2.1 European Defence Agency**

The European Defence Agency (EDA) was established by the Council of the European Union[25] in
2004 with the goal of supporting Member States in their efforts to improve defence capabilities in
the field of crisis management and to support the CFSP into the future. Participating Member States
continue to retain all decision making powers with regard to their defence policy, planning and
capability development. Ireland’s participation in the Agency is focused on the development of military
capabilities for UN-led or UN mandated peace support operations and leveraging the contribution
which the Irish Defence Forces in partnership with Irish Enterprise can make in delivering high end
research and technology in support of such capabilities. The financial commitment of participants to
this budget is in accordance with EDA funding principles, based on the Gross National Income (GNI)
key. In 2011 Ireland’s contribution was €284,047.

Ireland’s participation in the EDA means that we have access to research and information on
developing and maintaining professional capabilities and research that we cannot generate by
ourselves. Ireland is supportive of developments which improve market efficiencies, potentially
yielding economies of scale for equipment procurement for the Defence Forces. The Defence
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009 governs Ireland’s engagement with specific EDA projects or
programmes which is subject to Government and Dáil approval.

Ireland participates in the EDA’s Research and Technology Joint Investment Project on Force
Protection. This programme aims to enhance the security of deployed operations through improved
doctrine, best practice and emerging technologies. During 2011, Government and Dáil approval
was given for Ireland’s participation in a Joint Investment Programme on Chemical, Biological,

network that will allow for the sharing of data between Member States to compile a Recognised
Maritime Picture[26].

**4.3.2.2 Pooling and Sharing**

Over the past number of years the EU has focused very much on the financial crisis and how this is
impacting on the EU as a whole and indeed on individual Member States. In the context of defence
budget cuts and the requirement for EU Member States to retain, maintain and/or enhance their
military capabilities, in 2010, the EU embarked on a new initiative in the area of military capability
development called “Pooling and Sharing”. The concept involves groups of Member States coming
together and pooling resources which they can make available for CSDP operations. This represents
an effort to deliver greater cost efficiency through cooperation and economies of scale.

The Pooling and Sharing initiative affords Member States an alternative solution to protect, enhance
and acquire vital military capabilities in a time when prudent use of scarce finances is required. It
also affords Member States the opportunity to examine how best to avoid duplication of effort in
the delivery of military capabilities and therefore ensuring that tax payers’ money is well spent. This
can be further supported by exploring how collaboration between military and civilian bodies can
be advanced and how research funding for dual use goods can be optimised. This initiative is fully
supported by the European Defence Agency (EDA) and the EU Military Committee (EUMC) who
continue to support Member States in identifying opportunities for pooling and sharing in the areas
of training, equipment acquisition and research/technology developments, etc.

To date the EDA has proposed, in consultation with participating Member States, eleven initiatives
under Pooling and Sharing to address key capability gaps as well as to increase overall efficiency
and cost-effectiveness. Some of the EDA pooling and sharing initiatives identified are as follows:
helicopter pilot training programme; medical field hospital (Italian lead); air to air refuelling (French
lead); future military satellite communications; cyber defence. Also, the Irish Naval Service is leading
a study on Naval Mariner training. The objective of the study is to review and evaluate what training
is currently available across the Union with a view to consolidating EU capabilities in this area and
deliver value for money training for our naval mariners.

European States are also increasingly cooperating in Defence matters bilaterally and multilaterally
outside of the EU framework, but appropriate to their particular circumstances. The Nordic states
for example, have established the Nordic Defence Cooperation Organisation (NORDEFCO).
NORDEFCO consists of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. It has the aim of
strengthening the participating nations´ national defence, explore common synergies and facilitate
efficient common solutions. They recently agreed to establish a Nordic pool of airlift resources.

**4.3.3 NATO/PfP**

The Defence Forces must be able to operate seamlessly alongside other EU Member States. This
has been evident where Ireland has operated in partnership alongside other Member States such
as Sweden in Liberia, the Netherlands in Chad and Finland in Chad and Lebanon.

Ireland had just joined Partnership for Peace (PfP) when the White Paper was approved by
Government in 2000. PfP is a programme of practical cooperation between individual Euro Atlantic
partner countries and NATO. PfP facilitates interoperability with other militaries in peace support

area and links data and information on vessels, activity and incidents compiled from various national and international
monitoring and surveillance systems.

operations. NATO is the primary standard setting organisation for modern conventional armed
forces. In this regard, NATO has adopted a multitude of formal military standards to ensure seamless
integration and interoperability of multi-national forces, which includes standards for training,
equipment, operational procedures and administration. All NATO members and partners, including
non-NATO EU Member States, have adopted these standards.

PfP allows partners to build up an individual relationship with NATO, choosing their own priorities for
cooperation, tailored to individual needs and jointly implemented at the level and pace chosen by
each participating government. Cooperation focuses, in particular, on defence-related work, including
defence reform, defence policy and planning, civil-military relations, education and training, crisis
management, and civil emergency planning.

Ireland’s ongoing engagement with NATO/PfP, in the Partnership Goal process and with the
Planning and Review Process (PARP), is a key factor in supporting interoperability and capability
development. It enables Ireland to contribute high-end capabilities to UN mandated operations.
Under NATO PfP, Ireland’s annual Individual Partnership Cooperation Programme (IPCP) focuses
on the enhancement of skills and expertise in such areas as operational and generic planning for
peacekeeping and peace support, communications, command and control, operational procedures
and logistics. Activities include training courses, seminars, workshops, conferences, staff exercises
and tabletop exercises.

## 5. Other Roles assigned to the Defence Forces

In addition to the security roles, the other roles assigned to the Defence Forces have continued
to evolve over the period since the White Paper was published. Operations relating to these roles
can encompass ongoing tasks and contingencies. Since the publication of the White Paper, the
Framework for Major Emergency Management was published in 2006. Although the Defence Forces
are not a principal response agency, as defined in the Framework, many Departments and agencies
with lead responsibility for the various elements of emergency planning often request the assistance
of the Defence Forces and other specialised services in emergency situations.

Where services are provided to other Departments and Agencies on a regular basis or for routine
services, a formal agreement such as a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or a Service
Level Agreement (SLA) is put in place as a framework for the provision of services. These are
reviewed periodically and updated as required. Where appropriate, consideration is given to the
recommendation in the (McCarthy) Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and
Expenditure Programmes that the full-economic cost be charged to the relevant Department/Agency
for assistance provided by the Defence Forces. The negotiation of such agreed arrangements
continues to facilitate a planned and efficient response in all situations. A list of current MoUs and
SLAs in place is included in Appendix 4.

In the context of the severe weather events that have occurred in recent years all assets, resources
and capabilities of the Defence Forces nationally were made available to the Government Task Force
on Emergency Planning and its Inter Agency Coordination Committee. This was for the purpose of
providing assistance to other agencies where additional capacity and /or specialised capabilities
were required.

The Air Corps continues to provide a Ministerial Air Transport Service (MATS) for Government,
routine maritime patrols throughout the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone (and periodically beyond these
limits), and, an emergency inter hospital air ambulance service on an as available basis. Separately,
in support of the HSE, since June 2012 the Air Corps has dedicated a helicopter to participate in a
one-year pilot emergency aeromedical support service which operates out of Custume Barracks,
Athlone. In 2004 the Air Corps was withdrawn from its maritime Search and Rescue (SAR) role.
Since then, the Irish Coast Guard has overall responsibility for the provision of SAR services but
in the context of the Defence Forces role in providing aid to the civil authorities, the Air Corps does
provide support to the Irish Coast Guard as the need arises and within its available capability. A
limited Maritime SAR capability has been retained by the Air Corps as a contingency in the context
of their security role.

In accordance with the White Paper, the primary day-to-day tasking of the Naval Service is providing
sea fishery protection services based on outputs agreed with the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority
(SFPA). The Naval Service is committed to having at least three vessels on patrol at all times
throughout the Irish exclusive fishery limits and periodically beyond these limits. When carrying
out its fishery protection role, all Naval Service vessels are multi-tasked in the sense that they
also undertake general surveillance, security and other duties while on patrol. Since the White
Paper was published, the Naval Service has been participating in joint deployment plans with other
Member States, which are the means whereby the EU Community Fishery Control Agency supports
operational cooperation between EU Member States in conducting fishery patrols.

The Naval Service also provides assistance to other maritime agencies, including supporting the
Irish Coast Guard in ship casualty and pollution monitoring/control operations. The Naval Service
Diving Section and Naval Service ships also provide assistance to the civil authorities in SAR and
drug interdiction operations.

**Defence support to economic development**

Apart from the Defence contribution to ensuring a secure environment, which is the bedrock of
economic development and success, over recent years there have been significant developments
which have broadened the Defence contribution to economic development. The Defence Forces have
a long tradition of supporting Irish industry and research institutes in the development and delivery of
capabilities for Defence Forces operations. In addition, following the establishment of the European
Defence Agency, Defence has participated in a range of multilateral projects, most particularly in the
area of force protection, chemical, biological and nuclear energy protection, counter IED detection,
analysis and destruction, counter IED training, maritime surveillance and naval mariner training.

In July 2011, Government approval was received, pursuant to s. 8(5) of the Science and Technology
Act, 1987 whereby Enterprise Ireland would support Defence by raising the awareness of and
engaging with, Irish-based enterprise and research institutes, including third level colleges that
are engaged in relevant activities related to Defence Forces capability development. The primary
objective is to support Defence Forces capability development and also to support innovation,
growth and jobs in Irish based industry, particularly in the security and defence (dual use) sector,
which can contribute to Ireland’s economic development and recovery. In addition, the Government
agreed that Enterprise Ireland could also support Irish based enterprise and research institutes, the
Department of Defence and Defence Forces Capability Development, where appropriate in relation
to European Defence Agency ongoing activities.

A policy framework has been agreed with Enterprise Ireland which includes the establishment of
a Defence Enterprise Committee to consider proposals for such engagement. Under the policy
framework the Defence Forces makes available, within its capability and resources, and where
deemed appropriate, resources, expertise, advice and information, to Enterprise Ireland supported
companies and other companies and institutions engaged in research, innovation and product/service
development in the security and defence arena. The support offered by the Defence Forces under
this policy includes the evaluation of technology research and innovation, provision of information
on military requirements and the Defence Forces considered views on trends in specific capability
development requirements. Separately, the Defence Forces may independently initiate projects in
areas of interest to it with Irish enterprise or research institutes.

Key projects currently being supported by Defence include:

a) Hazard prediction analysis of a chemical/biological warfare agent in a dense urban environment,
blast overpressure production from current IEDs and blast wave interactions in an urban
environment; and development of lightweight armour systems for first responders with Carlow
Institute of Technology.

b) Explosive and chemical testing sensors and a project on developing procedures, practices and
guidelines for chemical biological radiological and nuclear forensic aspects with the Tyndall
Institute.

c) The establishment and operation of the PPP National Maritime College of Ireland in conjunction
with Cork Institute of Technology (CIT) as a civil military collaboration for delivering education
and training to both naval and merchant seafarers.

d) Support to the Irish Maritime and Energy Resource Cluster (I-MERC), a collaboration between
CIT, University College Cork and the Naval Service which brings together expertise in the fields
of energy engineering, maritime operations, maritime technology and ecosystem governance.

Within the Enterprise Ireland policy framework, the Defence Forces are also participating in a range
of projects in support of Irish companies and research institutes under the EU’s FP7 programme.


-----

In 2012, the Government published an integrated marine plan for Ireland, titled “Harnessing Our
Ocean Wealth”, which sets out to enable Ireland’s marine potential to be realised. Maritime safety,
security and surveillance were earmarked as an enabler and in this regard the Naval Service was
identified as having a role in developing and implementing systems to provide real-time operating,
surveillance and monitoring information on activity within Ireland’s maritime domain.

## 6. Future Defence and Security Environment

The security and defence environment has changed fundamentally since the publication of the
Defence White Paper in 2000. The previous chapters have described the wide range of policy
responses that have been implemented at both national and EU level over the intervening years.
This process of change continues and the policy responses appropriate to today’s world will require
constant review and revision in order to remain relevant. The knowledge and experience residing in
Irish institutions can be combined with the perspectives of the UN and EU to guide our expectations
regarding the future direction of the security and defence environment.

In short, Ireland will continue to face a broad range of security challenges in the period ahead
reflecting the significant changes to the defence and security environment that have evolved
alongside globalisation. In addition, there will be an expectation that we will continue to fulfil our
international obligations in contributing to international peace and security.

While there is a variety of opinion concerning possible future trends, two dominant themes run
through all of the available analysis:

1. Firstly, the defence and security environment will continue to change rapidly and unpredictably;
however, the risk of a conventional military attack on Ireland’s territory from another State will
remain very low and

2. Secondly, the world has evolved to the point where no one country acting alone can respond
adequately to the collective threats in the defence and security environment. States are
increasingly accepting that collaboration in defining the shared threats to security, as well as in
the collective response, is necessary.

As a small open economy Ireland benefits from globalisation. At the same time, Ireland is exposed
to all of the dangers, uncertainties and challenges in the wider defence and security environment
that accompany globalisation. As the world becomes ever more networked and interdependent,
the distinction between the internal and external aspects of security becomes ever more blurred.
Ireland’s geographic isolation does not provide the same degree of protection as in the past, from
these new and emerging threats. Threats to the EU, to European interests and to wider security
are now threats to Ireland. Both national security and our social and economic well-being will be
affected by the global and regional environment. Military neutrality is a policy position that was
framed in the context of inter-state armed conflict. However, it was not envisaged as a response
to the transnational threats outlined here or to threats emanating from non-state actors such as
terrorists.

The future threats to security are interconnected, more diverse, less visible and less predictable
than heretofore. They increasingly involve non-state actors such as terrorists, for whom national
borders are irrelevant. States must coordinate responses in order to address these emerging
threats. Security threats arise from extremism, international terrorism, organised crime, cyber crime
and cyber terrorism. Population growth, energy competition, migration, environmental degradation
and climate change all impact on both security and the response to humanitarian crises. Poverty
and stunted economic development, taken with trends in population growth and migration, provides
an environment in which terrorist recruitment and illegal economic activity can flourish.

According to Kofi Annan, as Secretary General of the UN, “We can no longer afford to see problems
_such as terrorism, or civil wars, or extreme poverty, in isolation. Our strategies must be comprehensive._
_Our institutions must overcome their narrow preoccupations and learn to work across the whole_


-----

_range of issues, in a concerted fashion” [27]._

According to the UN Panel of High Level threats, “Terrorism attacks the values that lie at the heart of
_the Charter of the United Nations: respect for human rights; the rule of law; rules of war that protect_
_civilians; tolerance among peoples and nations; and the peaceful resolution of conflict”. The threat_
derives from movements that are well resourced, connected by electronic networks and are willing
to use unlimited violence to cause massive casualties. A stated aim of Al Qaida is to target Western
Europe and its way of life. Self-radicalised groups have emerged, such as those influenced but
not directed by Al Qaida. Ireland must remain vigilant in this regard and also has a responsibility to
ensure that the State does not become a safe haven for transnational terrorist groups or individuals.

The experience in other European countries has shown that the threat level from terrorism can
escalate rapidly. Spain, France, Sweden, Germany and the UK have been targeted by credible
terrorist plots. A threat can emerge suddenly as a result of factors that lie outside the control of
Government. For example, the security situation in Denmark worsened significantly and without
notice following the publication of controversial cartoons featuring the prophet Muhammad in 2005.
European experience has also shown that self radicalised “lone wolf” extremists can operate outside
of terrorist networks. The level of impact caused by the actions of an individual was seen in Norway
in 2011.

Ireland has always engaged actively, through the EU, UN and other international bodies in crisis
management and in tackling the root causes of instability. Military intervention, through the UN,
is one of the instruments used by the international community in the collective security response.
Active engagement by Ireland in this collective response can on occasion lead to an increase in the
threat to Ireland, without however, significantly altering the general security environment that Ireland
faces.

In the Western Balkans, the efforts of the international community have contributed to the ongoing
stability. However, some difficulties remain which need to be addressed, building on the security
achieved so far.

Tensions in Asia and the Middle East and regional conflicts in Africa and elsewhere will continue to
challenge international peace and security. The defence and security environment will continue to be
dynamic and it will continue to be difficult to predict all future developments. The suddenness, scale
and escalation of recent uprisings in some Arab States have led to a fundamental transformation in
the political, economic and social conditions in many of the countries of North Africa and the Middle
East. While these developments have led to the overthrow of many dictatorships, they have done so
at a significant cost in human lives and have created instability as the countries concerned attempt
to rebuild their political institutions. These efforts are likely to require significant time.

In Africa, problems associated with weak political institutions and other political and economic
difficulties all call for a response from Europe, amongst others. For example, piracy and criminality,
particularly off the African coasts (the Horn of Africa, Somalia and the Gulf of Aden) has implications
for aid distribution and the flow of international trade. This is currently being combated directly
through the European Union Naval Force (EU NAVFOR) – Operation Atalanta.

Failed and failing States remain a source of internal distress to citizens, as havens for terrorism and
of regional uncertainty. Security threats thrive in weak states. During conflict and in post conflict
re-building, States require assistance in enhancing the capacity of their institutions, including in
security and defence. Through EUCAP Nestor, the EU is assisting States in the Horn of Africa to

Challenges and Change (A More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility)” 2004.

develop a self-sustaining capacity to enhance their maritime security and governance. Through
EUTM Somalia, the EU is contributing to stabilising Somalia by training Somali soldiers.

The proliferation and potential use of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN)
weapons will continue to be of major concern to the international community.

In March 2008, the EU High Representative and Commission presented a report to the European
Council which described climate change as a "threat multiplier which exacerbates existing trends,
tensions and instability". The report indicated that climate change could lead to disputes over trade
routes, maritime zones and resources previously inaccessible. According to the report, “the core
challenge is that climate change threatens to overburden states and regions which are already
fragile and conflict prone”. The risks are not just of a humanitarian nature; they also include political
and security risks that directly affect European interests[28].

**Domestic Security**

The Good Friday Agreement has delivered a stable peace process that commands overwhelming
cross community support. Nonetheless, so called ‘dissident’ republican groups, with very limited
levels of support, remain intent on disrupting the progress which has been achieved. Accordingly,
there is a requirement for continued vigilance. There are ongoing reviews of the threat assessment
arising from the activities of these groups taking into account particularly evidence of amalgamation
and cooperation between the various groups.

Certain security risks which were previously associated primarily with subversive paramilitaries are
now also associated with criminal gangs. The Defence Forces continue to provide armed support to
the Garda Síochána, for example in the transit of cash and in prisoner escorts. The use of improvised
explosive devices by criminals within the State requires a major ongoing response from Defence
Forces Explosive Ordnance Disposal, which continues to increase. Human trafficking and drug
smuggling connects domestic and international criminals. The State is actively combating these
criminal networks in partnership with EU Member States.

At present, the main international threats to domestic security arise from terrorist acts or a major
emergency incident (e.g. nuclear accident, medical epidemic, etc.). Overall, the direct threat to
Ireland as a target of international terrorism is currently assessed as low. However, the State
shares the common risk that arises for western democracies generally. In addition, Ireland has a
responsibility to ensure that international terrorists cannot use the State as a refuge or as a base
from which to direct their activities against targets in other countries. Regarding the threat from
major accidents/emergencies, military capabilities will continue to contribute to the response. The
‘Framework for Major Emergency Management (2006)’ sets out the structure enabling the principal
response agencies such as the Garda Síochána, the HSE and Local Authorities to prepare for and
make a coordinated response to major emergencies. The Defence Forces provide a contingent
capability to support these agencies, with that support set out in MoUs and SLAs.

**Cyber Security**

Cyber crime represents a real and immediate threat to the welfare of individuals, business and
states. The cyber threat exists equally for Government and public utilities as well as for commercial
entities and individuals. Both nationally and internationally, there have been instances in recent
years of cyber attacks on businesses, State institutions and critical national infrastructure. The
experience gained from such attacks has heightened awareness of weaknesses in security and has

the European Council (14 March 2008).


-----

illustrated greater sophistication in the methods of attack on systems. Across Europe, Governments
are sharing information in developing protection against cyber attacks.

The response to the cyber threat remains a whole of Government challenge, with the Department
of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources taking the lead role with inputs in the security
domain from the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces. The Department of Communications,
Energy and Natural Resources has established a dedicated cyber security unit to assist in identifying
and protecting us from cyber attacks. The work of this unit is supported by an Inter-Departmental
Committee on Cyber Security established and chaired by that Department, which regularly reports
on progress and cyber security issues to the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning,
chaired by the Minister for Defence. The Government Task Force maintains cyber security as a
standing agenda item where regular updates are provided and where issues of common interest
may be raised and addressed. The Defence Forces are also contributing to this whole of Government
response by leveraging information sharing within the European military community.

The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, in conjunction with the
Department of Justice and Equality, the authorities in Northern Ireland and private sector
companies, operates a recurring public awareness campaign called "Make IT Secure"
(www.makeitsecure.ie) to raise public awareness of issues surrounding Internet access and cyber
security.

**Maritime Domain**

In the maritime domain, the area of State jurisdiction has been expanded to encompass the
continental shelf. This has implications for the provision of maritime law enforcement services.
Security challenges also arise in relation to enhanced economic activity that is planned within this
enlarged area of State jurisdiction. In 2012, the Government launched an integrated marine plan,
‘Harnessing our Ocean Wealth”. The plan sets two targets: to double the value of our ocean wealth
to 2.4% of GDP by 2030 and to increase the turnover from our ocean economy to exceed €6.4bn
by 2020. The plan includes maritime safety, security and surveillance as enablers of the growth and
investment envisaged. “Inter-agency cooperation at national, EU and international level, together
_with industry and research collaboration, are key elements in delivering on this agenda”. “In order_
_to provide assurances to investors and meet our international obligations, Ireland must continually_
_improve national capabilities in the areas of security, safety and eco-protection of the maritime_
_domain”. Work is ongoing on developing a shared common maritime picture which will facilitate_
enhanced maritime data sharing at national level and between EU partners and enhance the defence
and security of Ireland’s maritime interests.

**Resources and Information Sharing**

Global and regional political, economic, technological, energy, environmental and climate trends
will cause the wider defence and security environment to remain unpredictable. Defence budgets
across Europe are decreasing significantly as Governments respond to the global economic crisis.
To minimise the likelihood of threats materialising, States are increasingly engaging in cooperation
and resource prioritisation.

Information is also a key element of the assessment of the environment as well as of the policy
responses to threats identified. The world is increasingly networked and terrorism and organised
crime do not recognise borders. The sharing of information, from any source, between States and
with international organisations is critical as an early warning in establishing threats, in the evaluation
and development of policy responses as well as during any operations undertaken.

## Appendix 1: The Defence Organisation

The Defence Organisation has civil and military elements, which work collaboratively to ensure that
the Minister and Government’s requirements for Defence are delivered.

**The Department of Defence**

The Department of Defence was established by the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 and the Act
assigns to the Department “the administration and business of the raising, training, organisation,
_maintenance, equipment, management, discipline, regulation and control according to law of the_
_military defence forces”._

The Department's mandate has a constitutional and statutory basis which seeks to ensure the civil
control of the armed forces of the State. The Constitution of Ireland vests the right to raise and
maintain military or armed forces exclusively in the Oireachtas and expressly prohibits the raising
and maintenance of any other military or armed force for any purpose whatsoever.

The Act provides that the Minister is ‘Head’ of the Department. The Minister is assisted in discharging
his functions by the civil and military elements of the Department. The Secretary General is the
“principal officer” of the Department and is also appointed by the Minister for Finance as the Accounting
Officer for all defence expenditure in accordance with the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act,
1866. The authority, responsibility and accountability of the Secretary General are further elaborated
in the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993 and the Public Service Management
Act, 1997. The 1997 Act also requires the Secretary General to prepare a Strategy Statement for the
Minister’s approval and an annual report on performance.

The Department of Defence comprises civil and military elements with distinct but complementary
roles. The primary role of the civil element of the Department is to support the Minister as Head of
the Department, in particular by providing policy advice and support on Defence matters. The civil
element of the Department of Defence is central to the oversight and management of the Defence
Votes, the drive for efficiency and the process of change, formulating Defence policy, representing
Ireland at EU and international engagements in Defence, defending against litigation and providing
a range of services critical to the outputs of the Defence Forces. The civil element also provides
liaison between the Defence Forces and other Government Departments, public authorities, the EU
and public representatives. The Secretary General is the Minister’s principal defence policy adviser.

Defence Forces Headquarters (DFHQ) is the military element of the Department of Defence, which
is headed by the Chief of Staff, who is the Minister’s principal military adviser. It is focused on
planning, managing, formulating military advice, development, and major strategic issues affecting
the Defence Forces, including ongoing modernisation and transformation. DFHQ comprises a range
of military staffs, which have responsibilities ranging from Defence Forces Strategic Planning to
Operations, Logistics and Human Resource Management.

**DEFENCE FORCES**

The Defence Acts, 1954 to 2011 provide the legislative basis for the Defence Forces (Óglaigh na
_hÉireann). The legislation provides that Defence Forces Headquarters (DFHQ) is the military element_
of the Department of Defence. The Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces, who is the Minister’s
principal military adviser, heads DFHQ. As provided for in the Act the Minister has assigned duties
to the Chief of Staff. The Chief of Staff is directly accountable to the Minister for the performance of
these duties, which include responsibility for the military effectiveness, efficiency, organisation, and
economy of the Defence Forces. As provided for in the Acts and with the approval of the Minister,


-----

the Chief of Staff has, in turn, delegated responsibility for certain duties to the Deputy Chief of Staff
(Operations) and to the Deputy Chief of Staff (Support).

The Defence Forces are organised on conventional military lines providing a sufficiently flexible
structure to carry out all the roles assigned by Government. The Defence Forces consist of a
Permanent Defence Force (PDF) and a Reserve Defence Force (RDF).

The PDF is a standing force and provides the primary capabilities for military operations at home
and military peace support operations abroad. The RDF provides a contingent conventional military
capability to augment and assist the PDF in situations where such additional capabilities are required.

Civilian employees are engaged throughout the Defence Forces and provide a range of general
operative, trade and other services in military installations.

**PERMANENT DEFENCE FORCE**

The Permanent Defence Force consists of the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service.

**ARMY**

The Army provides the land component of the State’s Defence capabilities. The Army currently
provides the deployable military capabilities for overseas peace support, crisis management and
humanitarian operations augmented by personnel from the Air Corps and Naval Service. On a dayto-day basis the Army provides a broad range of operational outputs. These include activities in
support of an Garda Síochána such as providing cash escorts, prisoner escorts, explosive ordnance
disposal and prison security. The Army also undertakes tasks in support of the civil authorities
such as the provision of assistance in severe weather crises and is an integral part of the State’s
response to many contingencies.

Following the implementation of the reorganisation of the Defence Forces, the Army is structured
into two all-arms brigades. Each brigade is designated a territorial area of responsibility with specific
garrison locations. The Defence Forces’ Training Centre (DFTC), based in the Curragh, Co. Kildare
supports the training functions for the entire Defence Force. The Army also has a special forces unit
known as the Army Ranger Wing (ARW).

**Principal Weapons and Equipment System**

The principal weapon and equipment systems of the Army are as follows:
 - Weapons Systems on Mowag APCs (Armoured Personnel Carriers). The main weapon is a
12.7mm machine gun while the turret also has a co-axial 7.62mm general purpose machine

**AIR CORPS**

As the air component of the Defence Forces, the Air Corps provides air support capabilities to the
other components in carrying out their roles. On a day-to-day basis the Air Corps undertakes Army
support, fishery protection patrols, provides a Ministerial Air Transport Service and operates an air
ambulance service. The Air Corps routinely undertake tasks such as providing air cover for cash
in transit operations and providing pilots and technical support for the Garda Air Support Unit. In
addition, the Air Corps undertakes approved operations in support of the civil authorities.

The Air Corps is based at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, Dublin and consists of an operational
headquarters, two operational wings, two support wings, the Air Corps Training College, and a
Communication and Information Services Squadron.

The Air Corps fleet consists of:

 - 6 Agusta Westland AW139 aircraft. The AW139 is a medium-lift twin-engine helicopter, capable
of night time flying. It has a troop lifting capacity of up to 14 personnel in land and maritime
environments.

 - 2 EC135 P2 aircraft. These are light utility helicopters which are used for carrying out a wide
variety of roles for the Air Corps.

**NAVAL SERVICE**

The Naval Service, based in Haulbowline, Co. Cork, provides the maritime component of the State’s
Defence capabilities. It is the State’s principal sea going agency and is tasked with a broad range
of roles. The Naval Service has a flotilla of eight ships, an operational headquarters, an operations
command, a logistical support command and a Naval Service College.

On a day to day basis, routine patrols are multi-tasked to encompass security, safety and surveillance,
port security, fishery protection, drug interdiction, pollution control and search and rescue. The
Fisheries Monitoring Centre at the Naval Base is the designated national centre with responsibility
for monitoring all fishing activity within the Irish Exclusive Fishery Limits and all Irish fishing vessels
operating around the world. The Diving Section within the Naval Service routinely undertakes a
range of operations in support of an Garda Síochána and the civil authorities. The Naval Service
is also a partner at the National Maritime College and the Irish Maritime and Energy Resource
Cluster (IMERC) at Cork. In addition, Naval Service vessels have, on occasion, undertaken supply
and reconnaissance missions in support of overseas peace support operations and participated in
foreign visits in support of Irish trade and diplomacy.

The Naval Service fleet comprises an eight ship flotilla of patrol vessels:

 - one Helicopter Patrol Vessel (HPV) – LE Eithne,

 - two Large Patrol Vessels (LPV) - LE Niamh, LE Róisín,

 - three Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPV) - LE Aoife, LE Aisling, LE Emer, and

 - two Coastal Patrol Vessels (CPV) - LE Orla and LE Ciara.

The LE before the ships names means Long Éireannach or Irish Ship. Each vessel is equipped with
state of the art machinery, weapons, communication’s and navigation systems.

The Naval Service ship replacement programme is integral to the future of the Naval Service and
will see two new ships in service in the near future. Delivery of the first ship is programmed for early
2014 followed by the second in 2015. The new ships will replace two of the older Naval Service
vessels, which will be withdrawn from operational service.

**RESERVE DEFENCE FORCE**

The Reserve Defence Force (RDF) provides a capacity to augment the Permanent Defence Force
in its contingent Defence role and other crisis situations. It consists of the First Line Reserve (FLR),
the Army Reserve (AR) and the Naval Service Reserve (NSR).

The FLR is comprised of former members of the Permanent Defence Force who have undertaken,
either voluntarily or on foot of a contractual commitment, to complete a period of service in the
FLR. There is no set establishment for the FLR; its strength is dependent on recruitment policy and


-----

reserve commitments given voluntarily or on foot of contractual commitments.

The AR and NSR are comprised of volunteers who undertake reserve activities in their spare time.
Arising from the recommendations of a Value for Money Review of the Reserve Defence Force, which
was published in November 2012, the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve have a revised
establishment of 4,069 personnel (3,869 AR and 200 NSR). The AR and NSR have undergone a
major reorganisation. Defence Forces’ Army Units now have Permanent and Reserve elements
within a “Single Force” structure. The number of Reserve Units has been consolidated and the
number of Army Reserve locations retained outside of PDF installations was reduced to 16. These
changes will deliver significant efficiencies and reduce direct expenditure on the Reserve by €11
million in 2013.

The VFM also recommended that members of the Reserve be afforded the opportunity to undertake
Aid to the Civil Authority type tasks in a voluntary unpaid capacity.

**Reserve Defence Force Strength as at 30 November 2012**

The strength of the First Line Reserve as at 30 November 2012 was 263 personnel.

The effective strength of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve at 30 November 2012 was
4,371 personnel (Army Reserve 4,191, Naval Service Reserve 180).

**CIVIL DEFENCE**

Civil Defence was set up in 1950 and the Civil Defence organisation currently has over 5,000 trained
active volunteers based in local authority areas nationwide. Volunteers join Civil Defence through
the local authority for their area and, in time, may progress and qualify as Instructors in one or more
disciplines.

The principal role of Civil Defence is to act as a volunteer based high-quality second line emergency
response service supporting the frontline services in addition to its community support activities.
Civil Defence is very much integrated into emergency planning and response arrangements at local,
regional and national level.

Civil Defence operates as a partnership between the Department of Defence at national level and
local authorities at local level. The Department has responsibility for Civil Defence policy and for the
management and development of the organisation at national level. The relevant local authority is
responsible for the management and operational control of Civil Defence at local level.

Civil Defence services are managed at local level by the Civil Defence Officer (CDO) of the relevant
local authority. The CDO is a full time employee of the local authority and is responsible for the dayto-day management of Civil Defence matters under the overall direction of the relevant City/County
Manager.

The Department of Defence provides policy guidance and administrative support to local authorities
and centralised training for Civil Defence volunteers in a range of disciplines such as casualty,
rescue, auxiliary fire, radio communications, welfare and warden services. Multi disciplined training
is the norm within Civil Defence.

The level of Civil Defence activity over the course of extended periods of severe weather in recent
years demonstrated the capability of Civil Defence to deploy significant skilled resources to assist
communities in the event of a major emergency and shows the ongoing commitment of Civil Defence
volunteers to serving their communities.


-----

In addition to its community support activities Civil Defence search and rescue units country-wide
routinely respond to calls from the Gardaí and other front-line services requesting support in the
rescue and recovery of missing persons both on land and in rivers and lakes.

## Appendix 2: Defence Forces Operations in 2012

The operational outputs of the Defence Forces encompass land, maritime and air operations, both
at home and overseas. As previously outlined, there are also a range of capabilities that are on
standby as part of the United Nations Standby Arrangement System (UNSAS) or in meeting EU
Helsinki Headline Goal or Battlegroup commitments. The following illustrate some of the current
day-to-day operational demands on the Defence Forces.
