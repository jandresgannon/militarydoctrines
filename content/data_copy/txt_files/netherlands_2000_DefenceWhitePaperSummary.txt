## Summary of the Defence White Paper 2000

# SUMMARY OF THE

 DEFENCE WHITE PAPER 2000

Introduction

_Further modernisation of the armed forces_

**The Defence White Paper 2000 takes important steps towards completing the**
**transformation process of the armed forces. Among the tasks of the armed**
**forces, that of conducting peace operations has gained greatly in importance.**
**Over the past ten years, Dutch units have made an active contribution to a large**
**number of peace operations. The Dutch armed forces were transformed into an**
**all-volunteer force, while simultaneously being restructured and downsized. In**
**the course of this process, a number of shortcomings came to light, while new**
**requirements were also formulated, particularly in relation to the operational**
**readiness of the armed forces and personnel policy. The contours of the new**
**defence policy were outlined in the Framework Memorandum of January 1999.**
**These contours have taken a definite form in the Defence White Paper 2000,**
**which charts the course to be taken in the coming decade.**

Over the last few years, our armed forces have undergone radical change and
modernisation, but new steps are needed. The government is aware of the political and
public support for this view, as evidenced in the parliamentary discussion on the
Framework Memorandum and during the Strategic Discussion on the Future of
Defence. Over the past period, social and political support for Defence has markedly
increased. The financial framework outlined in the Government Policy Accord forms the
starting point for the plans launched in this Defence White Paper. The additional NLG
50 million for the Defence budget, which was recently allocated, marks a turning point in
the political climate after years of structural cut-backs and increases confidence where
the available budget for the coming years is concerned. This is all the more important in
light of the daunting tasks with which the Defence organisation is faced.

The need for renewal stems not only from international developments and experiences
during recent operations, such as those in Kosovo; we must also keep pace with rapid
and far-reaching changes within our own national borders. The meagre labour market
thus places considerable demands on personnel policy, which occupies an important
place in the Defence White Paper. The changing relations between government and
society have a direct impact on the way in which the Defence organisation functions,
the central theme in the Process of Change in the Defence Organisation.

Difficult choices are involved in the formulation of defence plans Black and white are

p
evaluation of security risks and the military threat is paramount. More than ever before,
the nature and scope of the defence effort are also determined by the willingness to
share responsibility for the international community. Furthermore, desirability does not
always mean feasibility.

All things considered, the government is convinced that this White Paper constitutes a
foundation rich with possibilities for the development of the Defence organisation over
the next ten years. The 2000 Defence White Paper contains important innovations. The
cut-backs laid down in the Government Accord require structural measures to be taken.
The Defence White Paper 2000, however, does more than implement the intended cutbacks. While reductions will be effected in some areas, efforts will be stepped up in
other areas. The coming decade will see financial adjustments being made to the
amount of just under NLG 10 billion. The aim is to prepare the armed forces for the

challenges of the 21[st]century.

The Strategic Discussion on the Future of Defence (STD) was characterised by four
recurring elements: the increase in the combat-ready strength, the improvement of
sustainability, the need for a re-evaluation of the workload of armed forces personnel in
the light of the frequency of deployment and making a more efficient use of reserve
personnel. The wishes and desires that were formulated in the course of the STD were
taken into serious account in preparing the Defence White Paper 2000. The plans
specified in this Defence White Paper provide for a further increase in combat-ready
strength on top of the increase announced in the Framework Memorandum. The
combat-ready personnel of rapidly deployable units will increase by 2,100. Fifty percent
of this increase will benefit mechanised infantry units. We consider this increase of 900
military personnel on top of the figure mentioned in the Framework Memorandum to be
the maximum achievable for the present moment. The problems identified in relation to
the frequency of deployment are not characteristic of the entire spectrum of the armed
forces, but mainly concern combat functions, engineers and medical personnel. The
increase in the combat-ready strength is mainly targeted to these and other bottlenecks.
The Defence White Paper formulates a number of measures aimed at reducing the
workload of armed forces personnel as a result of the frequency of deployment. In
future, reserve personnel are to be deployed more frequently, also in the context of
peace operations.

The armed forces must be capable of carrying out various tasks in various scenarios
and operational alliances. Flexibility and multi-functional deployability are key words in
this context. Although the structure of the armed forces is determined to an important
extent by the more demanding combat tasks, the armed forces, following some
adjustments, can also be rendered suitable for carrying out lighter tasks. The
Netherlands cannot afford to have highly specialised armed forces. The armed forces
need to be deployable across the entire spectrum of tasks: from combat tasks and
military assistance to contributing to civil government tasks.

The international environment imposes high demands on the military personnel who
often face complex situations, in which both diplomatic and military skills are required.
Deployed military personnel may be faced with serious humanitarian emergencies and
difficult moral choices The care for personnel therefore is at the very heart of the

Armed forces personnel must have the professional knowledge and skills and the
flexibility required to be able to carry out all their tasks properly. This will lead to farreaching changes in the personnel structure in the coming decade, as well as to a
considerable reduction in the average age of the personnel complement. This change is
not caused by international developments and the change of tasks of the armed forces
alone, however. Changes in Dutch society also have an important bearing on the
structure and procedures of the armed forces. The Defence organisation welcomes this
input by society. Social developments and developments concerning conditions of
employment, which apply to employees in the Netherlands as a whole, in principle also
apply to military personnel. The Defence organisation must offer its personnel
challenging and motivating work and good working conditions. The men and women
employed by the armed forces must be offered attractive opportunities for career
development, both in the Defence organisation itself and with a view to their return to
the civilian labour market. In this context it is likewise of the utmost importance for
conditions to be created which enable work and private life to be combined as well as
possible. Annually, an additional NLG 150 million will be made available for the purpose
of intensifying personnel policy.

As described above, the choice of the appropriate structure and size of the armed
forces, which is the central theme of this Defence White Paper, is anything but selfevident. It goes without saying that the international situation and the security risks
involved are to be taken into account. International alliances, however, not only
enhance our security, they also impose obligations. At some point or other, foreign
policy and domestic policy are bound to overlap. It is at that point that we shall have to
make our own decisions. This poses the question as to how our society wishes to deal
with the opportunities and the risks involved in a world without frontiers. What sacrifices
are we willing to make for our norms and values? What is our level of ambition? What
financial resources are we willing to dedicate to achieving our ambitions?

The Netherlands is expected to make its contribution to the common effort and not
sponge off the efforts of other countries. Peace and stability constitute a common good,
to which all should contribute. Our international position and influence are in part
determined by our political, economic and not least, military contribution. After all, the
political and social support in our own country and the importance attached by our
society to national interests and values also play a role here. In short, what is our level
of ambition?

Large parts of the world are characterised by instability. Only a relatively limited number
of countries are capable of exporting stability. The Netherlands has been making a
meaningful contribution in this context. Therefore, Dutch foreign policy may be expected
to be both active and committed to and focused on promoting peace and stability
throughout Europe and elsewhere in the world. The armed forces constitute an
important, if not indispensable, instrument towards achieving this end.

Antilles and Aruba;

    - advancing the international rule of law and stability;

    - assisting the civil authorities in the context of law enforcement, disaster relief
and humanitarian aid, both nationally and internationally.

The level of ambition for the Dutch armed forces laid down in the Government Policy
Accord comprises contributions to NATO in the framework of collective defence and
participation in a maximum of four peacekeeping operations simultaneously with
battalion-sized units or their equivalent, if necessary for a period of three years. This is
in keeping with the ambitions and capabilities of a country such as the Netherlands and
expresses our commitment to international involvement. The level of ambition is
determined to a great extent by the sum total of military capabilities which our country
can make available to international alliances for collective defence and for crisis
management, peacekeeping and humanitarian operations. The defence plans outlined
in this White Paper describe the military capabilities necessary to fulfil the demands laid
down in the Government Policy Accord. The large variety of missions requires a large
variety of modules. However, theory and practice part company when it comes to the
number of deployed units actually required and the actual duration of the deployment.
This is illustrated by what has occasionally been a sizeable deployment in Bosnia and
Kosovo over the much longer period of three years. The armed forces have a wide
range of choices with regard to the assets which may be deployed for peacekeeping
operations. A priority in this respect is that the armed forces must be organised and
equipped for the general defence tasks. There must be some margin to enable the
armed forces to function well and to allow a certain amount of political freedom of
choice.

To carry out the tasks defined above, the armed forces must be capable of the following:

   - general defence in a NATO context, which may involve mobilisation of reserve
units;

   - participation for a limited duration in a peace-enforcement operation with a
brigade or its equivalent (e.g. a maritime task group, three squadrons of fighter
aircraft, or a combination of these units);

   - sustained participation in a maximum of four peace operations involving
contributions at battalion level or its equivalent (e.g. a squadron of fighter aircraft
or two frigates);

    - national military tasks, such as the protection of the integrity of national territory,
coastal waters and air space;

   - civilian government tasks, such as police tasks carried out by the Royal
Marechaussee (border control, mobile monitoring of aliens and security on
aviation premises) and providing military assistance in helping to carry out civil


-----

   - safeguarding the territorial integrity of the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba and
carrying out civil tasks, such as coastguard duties and the fight against drugs.

**Military operations in a changing environment**

Dealing with unpredictability is the biggest problem with which planners are faced.
Where, when, with whom, under what circumstances and for what task the units of our
armed forces are deployed in the future is uncertain. However, significant trends can be
identified. Operations are being conducted further from home. Units must be prepared
for operations in the entire spectrum of force, partly so that they can achieve escalation
dominance. Rapid deployment is vitally important. Operations often last for years and
always take place in an international context.

Modern armed forces must be flexible. For this reason, the Dutch armed forces are
based on the module concept: the armed forces represent a system of modules which
can form part of multinational military alliances. They must be able to operate in groups
led by NATO, the UN, the (W)EU or an ad hoc coalition.

The old, fairly marked distinction between operating for collective defence and
participating in peace operations no longer exists. The result of all this is that the
demands placed on units for the collective defence and for peace tasks are very similar
nowadays. All the Netherlands active units must be suitable for both main tasks;
flexibility is the key element.

Further improvement of the flexibility, combat-readiness, mobility, combat power,
sustainability, security, interoperability and quality was the theme of the Framework
Memorandum; the same applies to the Defence White Paper. These general policy
objectives also occur in NATOs Defence Capabilities Initiative. The more the European
Allies manage to substantiate these objectives, the better the European military
contribution to NATO. In this way, the political ambitions in respect of European security
and defence policy are also supported by military capabilities. The coming years will
see an intensification in European defence cooperation. Opinions on this matter have
become more pragmatic, partly because the need to improve Europes defence capacity
has become even more apparent in the light of the conflict in Kosovo. The improvement
of the Dutch armed forces intended by the Defence White Paper should also be seen
against the background of the Netherlands desire to contribute to an improved
European military capacity. This will also benefit the vitality and cohesion of NATO, as
is also emphasised in the Strategic Concept.

**Improved levels of combat-readiness, flexibility and deployability**

In particular the combat-readiness and the deployability of Dutch land forces must be
further enhanced. This is rightly stressed in the Strategic Discussion on the Future of
Defence. It is, of course, limited by the recruitment possibilities on the meagre labour
market and by budgetary constraints. The measures in this Paper nonetheless mean
that the number of active functions in rapidly deployable units (as mentioned previously)
will be increased by 2,100, including one thousand mechanised infantry personnel and


-----

More specifically, this concerns:

*** the expansion incorporated in the Framework Memorandum by**
**approximately 800 active functions in the Royal Netherlands Army (RNLA):**
**500 for the mechanised infantry, 200 for the engineers and 100 for civil-**
**military cooperation and logistics;**

*** approximately 700 active functions in the RNLA as a result of new**
**measures in the Defence White Paper. These consist of 500 functions in**
**another three mechanised infantry companies which are to be activated,**
**150 functions for the enhancement of the operational target acquisition and**
**intelligence collection and 50 functions with logistic units;**

*** 300 extra functions in the Marine Corps, as envisaged in the Framework**
**Memorandum. A third marine battalion will be fully activated;**

*** 300 functions in the logistic ground units of the Tactical Helicopters**
**Group (THG) in order to improve sustainability; this will also increase the**
**level of operational deployability of the Airmobile Brigade.**

As well as all the combat-ready assets of the Royal Netherlands Navy, the Royal
Netherlands Air Force and the Royal Marechaussee, the armed forces will have a total
of 24 battalions (a battalion is made up of 800 men), from which the following can be
selected for deployment:

*** six mechanised battalions, each with two companies of mechanised**
**infantry and a tank squadron (approximately 600 military personnel).**
**Mechanised battalions of this sort are currently serving in NATOs SFOR in**
**Bosnia. The number of active mechanised infantry companies will be**
**doubled;**

*** three infantry battalions from the Airmobile Brigade;**

*** three battalions from the Marine Corps;**

*** nine battalion-sized units for special tasks, such as engineers, (air**
**defence) artillery and communications. Examples are the engineer auxiliary**
**battalion and the Gele Rijdersbattalion (field artillery), which are**
**participating in the NATO peace force in Kosovo;**

*** three battalion-sized units for logistic support, parts of which can**
**generally be assigned to other battalions to provide logistic support.**

With the exception of the marines, all these units are part of the German-Netherlands
Army Corps (GNC), which thus contains 21 Dutch units of battalion size that are
suitable for collective defence as well as peace operations outside NATO territory. In
addition, the corps has three active companies of commandos, which can be deployed


-----

If the proposed measures are implemented, the peacetime composition of the Dutch
armed forces will, in 2009, consist of more than 76,000 personnel (including civilians):
almost 16,600 in the Royal Netherlands Navy (RNLN), more than 34,500 in the RNLA,
over 12,700 in the (Royal Netherlands Air Force) RNLAF, approximately 5,500 in the
Royal Marechaussee and approximately 6,800 in the Defence Interservice Command
(DICO) and the core department.

Once the measures have been implemented, it will, in 2009, be possible to increase the
strength of the armed forces in the event of a major conflict to approximately 108,000
personnel: 19,500 in the RNLN, 56,700 in the RNLA, 17,200 in the RNLAF, 7,600 in the
Royal Marechaussee and approximately 6,800 in the DICO (and the core department).

The intended potential in terms of combat-ready, rapidly deployable land forces
represents the maximum that is currently regarded as feasible within the confines of the
recruitment possibilities.

**Sustainability and cooperation between the Services**

The measures intended to increase the level of combat-readiness and deployability will
contribute significantly to the level of sustainability. The structure of the armed forces
will also be better orientated to the deployment system for peace operations. The basic
principle in this respect is that three similar units are available at all times: one unit
preparing for deployment, one available for or on deployment and one recuperating.
This approach has not only been chosen for the land forces.

The Defence White Paper contains various initiatives which underline the growing
importance of cooperation between the Services. This is based on various
considerations:

   - an alert and flexible defence organisation requires that personnel can see
beyond and cross the partitions between the sections of the organisation, since it
is, despite all its diversity, a single entity;

*** military personnel from different Services operate together ever more**
**frequently during missions. The concept of joint operations by land, air and**
**naval forces is becoming increasingly important. There are strong military-**
**operational arguments for more cooperation between the Services, of which**
**the modules are also capable of operating jointly: modules such as a**
**mechanised battalion, a Patriot unit, the Amphibious Transport Ship (ATS)**
**and parts of the THG. Countries such as the United States and the United**
**Kingdom are now going to great lengths in response to the need to prepare**
**the armed forces for joint operations. This is a crucial success factor in**
**military operations. The Dutch modules will form part of multinational**
**groups which operate jointly and must be thoroughly prepared in this**
**respect. NATO also endorses this in the context of the Combined Joint Task**
**Forces (CJTF);**

*** cooperation between Services can improve efficiency for instance in**


-----

**Cooperation between the Services is increasingly taking shape. Familiar**
**examples are the cooperation between the RNLAFs THG and the RNLAs**
**Airmobile Brigade, the cooperation between the Commando Corps, the Marine**
**Corps and the Airmobile Brigade as well as the interservice disaster assistance**
**response teams. The DICO is also an illustration of this development.**

**New steps in interservice cooperation are required. The following initiatives will,**
**therefore, be taken:**

**·the object air defence of the RNLA and the RNLAF will be merged and**
**stationed at De Peel Air Base. The final stage of the merger is the setting up**
**of a Joint Air Defence Centre, which will also be responsible for the**
**operational planning, teaching and training;**

**·the training courses for air rescue and firefighting for all Services involved**
**will be given at a new school for the RNLAFs firefighting courses at**
**Woensdrecht Air Base. The aim is to concentrate the general firefighting**
**courses of the RNLN and the RNLA here as well. Highly specialised RNLN**
**firefighting courses will continue to be given on board ships in Den Helder**
**because of the connection with operational management;**

**·the technical and maintenance training for small arms will be merged, as**
**has already occurred in the case of courses for ammunition awareness and**
**the demining pool;**

**·for the armed forces as a whole, a new medical concept will be developed**
**which will more accurately reflect the changing circumstances under which**
**operations take place. In respect of the transport capacity for wounded**
**personnel, the accent will shift from ground transport to air transport, both**
**in the area of operations and from the area of operations to the**
**Netherlands. This will serve to increase speed, flexibility and efficiency.**
**Partly in aid of this new medical support concept, the armed forces will**
**have new light helicopters. In peace operations, the Services will be, as**
**they are now, able to call upon each others medical personnel;**

**·the three training institutes, the Royal Naval College (KIM), the Royal**
**Military Academy (KMA) and the Netherlands Defence College (IDL) will be**
**merged in a single, new administrative form. This will result in much closer**
**cooperation in respect of the officer training within the Defence**
**organisation. The initial training for midshipmen from the RNLN and cadets**
**from the RNLA and RNLAF is geared towards functioning in the respective**
**Services. In the final stage and in the secondary and tertiary training, they**
**will be much more involved in joint activities, as these form an important**
**part of the training. There will be a joint Military Science Faculty, which will**
**include professors and university lecturers from the KIM and the KMA. An**
**advisory council will monitor the academic standards and optimal**
**cooperation between the Services. The capacity of the Netherlands Defence**

**their future activities. Some Royal Marechaussee officers are currently**
**recruited from the other Services.**

**·there is to be an interservice capacity for civil-military cooperation (CIMIC)**
**for peace operations. At the request of NATO, the Netherlands will**
**probably, together with Germany, set up a core staff for a CIMIC group,**
**which will be expanded on deployment to form an international interservice**
**CIMIC unit. The interservice core staff will be incorporated in the RNLA. It**
**will also be possible to deploy the CIMIC unit for humanitarian relief for the**
**benefit of Development Cooperation;**

**·training courses in respect of the detection and clearance of mines and**
**explosives are to be merged. In 2002, there will be one EOD school for the**
**whole of the armed forces. This school will be part of the RNLA.**

**The future of the Dutch armed forces lies in international cooperation. Dutch**
**military units must, therefore, be able to fit easily into multinational alliances.**
**This imposes heavy demands on the teaching and training of personnel and on**
**equipment. The best example of multinational military cooperation is the**
**integrated military structure of NATO. This form of cooperation goes beyond**
**combined operations. NATO also plays a key role in the coordination of**
**standards and procedures of member states. The Netherlands is striving for**
**optimal harmonisation, since compatibility, or interoperability, is vitally important**
**now that personnel operate more than ever before in changing international**
**settings.**

**The German-Netherlands Corps (GNC) is, in international terms, one of the most**
**highly developed forms of cross-border military cooperation. There are good**
**reasons for proceeding with the efforts made by both countries to fully prepare**
**this unit for future tasks. The German-Netherlands Corps can play a major role in**
**connection with the requirement for rapidly-deployable ground troops for**
**peacekeeping operations. The high degree of integration in this corps is an**
**impetus for further European cooperation.**

**The reserve complement will be reduced but not abolished. It is still a relatively**
**cost-effective military capacity in the unexpected event that it will have to be**
**called upon in the future. All active armed forces generate a reserve complement**
**in the form of former military personnel. It is inefficient not to make use of this.**
**Reservists can contribute to peace operations to a growing extent. Thanks to**
**these personnel, the armed forces have people with rare expertise and skills**
**which are required temporarily but which cannot be incorporated in the defence**
**organisation because it would be too costly or simply not feasible; one example**
**of such a category is medical personnel.**

**Creating scope for new policy**

minehunters, three Orions, 136 Leopard-2 tanks from the reserve complement and
eighteen F-16 fighter aircraft. The planning also aims to create scope for the
improvement of the armed forces by abandoning replacement investment and
investments connected with disposal. The scale of investments in ammunition, air
defence and mine systems has also been reduced. These far-reaching measures have
been taken in the belief that the inevitable loss of combat power will be partly
compensated by the resulting scope for new policy, which will ensure that the armed
forces are better prepared for the future.

The Defence White Paper is based on difficult but careful decisions and assessments. It
is, however, impossible to predict with any accuracy the developments over the next ten
years. During the implementation of the Defence White Paper, therefore, a finger will
have to be kept constantly on the pulse. This will apply in particular to the following
aspects:

   - xperiences during peace operations;

    - ew military doctrine;

   - he permanent dialogue between the Defence organisation and society;

   - he results of recruitment on the labour market;

   - xperiences in connection with the new personnel policy;

   - xperiences in connection with the Process of Change in the Defence
Organisation;

   - xperiences in connection with Defences management concept;

   - he financial resources allocated to Defence;

   - ew opportunities for international cooperation and possible task specialisation;

   - he development of our Allies armed forces;

   - dvances in technology;

   - hanges in the cost of defence equipment.

**A modern defence organisation**

A modern defence organisation must be geared towards the future. The Defence White
Paper gives a ten-year perspective in the knowledge that a directional outlook is vital for
defence policy. This provides a foothold. Defence plans must be explained clearly and

support, the Defence organisation must be efficient, alert and flexible. The way in which
the organisation functions is thus the first aspect to be examined. Since last year, a
series of measures has been taken in the context of the Process of Change in the
Defence Organisation in order to improve the way in which the Defence organisation
functions. The organisation must, after all, meet the high standards set by the politicians
and society for a contemporary governmental organisation. The characteristics of the
Defence organisation underline the fact that it has a wide-ranging task which calls for
tailor-made measures. After all, the organisation:

   - is substantial (approximately 75,000 people);

   - is spread over some 350 locations;

   - has a high degree of diversity;

   - has in a short time been assigned important new tasks;

   - performs its tasks in a peacetime situation in the Netherlands, but must prepare
units for operations in wartime conditions;

   - operates within and outside our national borders, in the case of the latter in a
multinational context;

   - conducts activities which are certain to arouse major political and public interest;

   - has been undergoing constant, radical change since the beginning of the
nineties;

   - operates within a strict budgetary framework.

This imposes heavy demands on the administration of the Defence organisation. The
need for an alert and flexible response means that responsibilities cannot and must not
be too highly centralised. At the same time, the core department must have the
information that the political leaders need to steer the organisation in broad terms and
to be properly politically accountable. The idea is to unite centralisation and
decentralisation.

Defence is a large, multi-faceted government organisation which should be able to
respond swiftly to todays challenges. This places heavy demands on personnel and
also on the structure and culture of the organisation. During the course of last year, the
structure and work methods of Defence were brought into question, mainly as a result
of several incidents. This is why a decision was made last autumn to instigate the
Process of Change in the Defence Organisation, on which this Paper continues to build.

The measures taken to achieve the objectives of the Process of Change in the Defence
Organisation are also designed to ensure that the political leaders are better able to

placed on the Defence organisations management concept.

The government believes that the management of so complex and dynamic an
organisation requires central direction and decentralised execution. Decentralised
execution helps to ensure that the organisation can be swift and flexible in its response,
clarifies responsibilities and promotes efficiency. Central direction in broad terms is thus
preferable to centralisation.

Neither centralisation nor decentralisation is feasible as the only applicable principle.
Purely centralised management leads to delays and unwieldiness. Purely decentralised
management means that the overview is lost. The management concept of "central
direction and decentralised execution" reflects the balance. The decentralised execution
organisations provide the information which forms the basis on which the central
direction is conducted. The information must meet stringent requirements.

The Defence organisation is directed in broad terms from its core department; in 2001
the number of policy and policy support functions in the core department will be reduced
by 25% compared to 1995/1996. The Services and the DICO implement policy. In this
respect, the Commanders in Chief and the Commander of the DICO are, within the
confines of the policy set out by the political leaders, responsible and thus accountable.
This naturally goes hand in hand with clear reporting and monitoring.

The balance between operational and other units will be improved in the following ways:

   - ombat-readiness and deployability will be enhanced, partly by adding 2,100
extra functions to rapidly deployable ground forces;

   - he number of policy and policy support functions of Defences Central
Organisation and the staffs of the Commanders in Chief will be reduced by 25%
compared to 1995/1996;

   - xecutive tasks will be evaluated against the opportunities for efficiency
improvements and out-sourcing (competitive service provision).

An important factor in respect of the operational readiness of the Dutch armed forces is
that the deployment system - six months preparation, six months deployment or
standby for deployment and six months recuperation - significantly limits the number of
immediately deployable military personnel at any given time: we are, after all, talking
about one third of the entire complement. In view of the pressure on personnel, it would
not be appropriate to tighten this norm. On the contrary: thanks to the armed forces
increased levels of combat-readiness and deployability, this norm, which for some units
has been a reality for years, will gradually become the maximum.

Competitive service provision will promote more efficient management within the
Defence organisation. This will produce substantial savings. The aim is to achieve
savings amounting to at least NLG 40 million in 2001 and NLG 65 million the following
year From 2003 the savings should total NLG 100 million a year


-----

**_Reducing the average age of the personnel complement_**

The quality of the armed forces is increasingly determined by the question of whether
sufficient qualified and motivated personnel are available. The armed forces personnel
complement must, even though the quality, efforts and motivation of the current
individual employees are not being called into question, improve its position in terms of
meeting the requirements for a professional, flexible and rapidly deployable force.
Against that background, the personnel complement will acquire a broader base of
young personnel and a narrower top consisting of older employees. For many, a
professional military career will no longer mean a job for life.

The first objective is a shift in the ratio of regular personnel on indefinite contracts to
those on fixed-term contracts from 60:40 to 40:60. Once the new personnel policy has
been implemented, the difference between the two categories will diminish sharply. As
most personnel will leave the Defence organisation after five to seven years, it is vital
that measures be taken to increase the chances of former military personnel on the
labour market. This shift from job security to work security is also taking place
elsewhere in society.

An amount of NLG fifty million has been set aside for personnel policy in 2000; from
2001 this will be one hundred million per year. Despite the tight Defence budget, the
choice for this extra investment was made with conviction. The political support for the
intensification of personnel policy was endorsed during the Parliamentary Debate on the
Speech from the Throne in September this year when, at the time the Dijkstal motion
was carried, a decision was made to add a structural amount of NLG fifty million to
Defence resources for personnel policy. This amount is in addition to the
aforementioned funds already set aside.

The personnel policy serves to guarantee that the organisation has personnel at its
immediate disposal who are equal to their task. In this regard, two factors are
essentially influential: the developments in society and the special requirements that the
tasks of the armed forces impose upon their personnel.

In ten years time, the introduction of a new personnel structure will have resulted in a
well-balanced, streamlined personnel structure. Over the next ten years, some 5,200
people are expected to become supernumerary in the Defence organisation.
Instruments of the Defence Social Policy Framework will apply to personnel who
become supernumerary as a result of this or other measures. The Defence organisation
will provide the resources necessary to enable a successful transition to the civil sector.
The purpose in this respect is to avoid compulsory redundancies.

The assumption that a career in the Defence organisation is in principle a career for life
has been abandoned. Work security is to replace the certainty of a permanent job.
Offering work security, both within and outside the organisation, to each employee is a
spearhead of the policy intensification. This not only applies to the fixed-term contractor
who leaves the organisation, but also, without exception, to personnel who become
supernumerary for any reason whatsoever


-----

The range of tasks has become more extensive and the possibilities and areas of
deployment more varied. The work has thus become more challenging and the
operations conducted by military personnel - still exclusively regular personnel - are not
the same as they were a few years ago. The risk to individuals, however, is greater, as
are the effects on the home front. The military employee is faced with tasks of a special
nature, especially during the preparation and execution of tasks under operational
conditions. The personnel policy takes account of this and helps to ensure that
employees can perform their duties precisely under special circumstances. The policy
must find a balance between special and more general conditions and must also be in
line with norms outside the Defence organisation. This is particularly important in terms
of simplifying the transition to the civil sector for those personnel leaving the Defence
organisation after a fixed-term appointment.

Dutch society is changing at a fast pace. Of particular importance to the Defence
organisation are the demographic developments, especially the ageing population, the
increase in the average level of education, the loosening ties of employees to a
particular employer together with an increased labour mobility, changing labour
relations, the greater availability of women and ethnic minorities on the labour market,
the shifting roles of men and women and the deliberate search for a balance between
ones work and private life.

Measures are being taken to make Defence a more attractive employer in a competitive
position on the labour market. The Defence organisation is therefore not only investing
in work security, but also in the improvement of the working environment and working
conditions. These must be in balance with what Defence expects from its personnel.
General developments which affect all employees in the Netherlands also apply in
principle to military personnel, unless this compromises the tasks of the armed forces to
an unacceptable extent. A strong competitive position is not only necessary for the
purpose of recruiting new personnel, but also to keep existing personnel in the
organisation.

Over the next few years, the following principles and policy objectives will guide the
development of policy for defence personnel:

   - he prospect of good working conditions;

   - hallenging and inspiring work;

   - personnel structure which is in keeping with modern armed forces;

   - olding an advantageous position on the labour market;

   - he prospect of work security within and outside the Defence organisation;

   - social policy that takes account of the need to combine work and private life;

   - uarantee of effective support for personnel before, during and after deployment.

modern, flexible, rapidly deployable and professional armed forces, thus promoting a
satisfactory staffing of the organisation both in terms of quantity and quality and
ensuring support for the deployment of the armed forces in peace operations. To meet
the standards set by the organisation, the structure of the personnel complement will
have to undergo radical changes. On balance, this will mean that the average age is
lowered, thus improving the availability and deployability of operational units.

Furthermore, imbalances in the personnel structure of the armed forces, in particular
the age structure, can eventually be eliminated. These imbalances, which are partly the
result of the combination of lifetime career patterns and initiatives taken in the nineties
in respect of the reorganisation and reduction of the armed forces, would otherwise lead
irreversibly to the ageing of the Defence organisation in the coming years. With a
modified personnel structure and more young people in lower ranks, the distribution of
labour over the various function levels in the organisation must be reorganised. An
increase in the number of young people, particularly in the lower ranks, together with a
variable contract term, must produce the required flexibility in the new personnel
structure.

The starting points of the new personnel structure are thus flexibility, professionalism
and a reduction in the age of the personnel complement. This requires an increase in
the proportion of fixed-term contractors, thus changing the ratio of personnel on
indefinite contracts and those on fixed-term contracts. In the envisaged structure, sixty
percent of military personnel will ultimately have a fixed-term appointment. As
compared to the personnel complement at the beginning of 1999, 10,000 personnel on
indefinite contracts must thus be replaced by fixed-term contractors. The end-of-service
arrangements for military personnel will also be changed. Features of the new system
are the introduction of a capital-funded pension that will take immediate effect from the
age of 60, a flexible system of retirement ages between 55 and 60, with an average of
58, and an adjustment of the level of and eligibility for benefit. The revised end-ofservice system is to be introduced in 2001.

The guaranteed intake of more than 40,000 conscripts a year has given way to a
recruitment drive on the labour market, with a recruitment target of 7,000 fixed-term
contractors per year.

From the point of view of recruitment it is undeniably important that potential employees
are familiar with the functions available in the armed forces. The image held by young
people in respect of (functions in) the Defence organisation is a decisive factor in this
respect. A recent study has shown that, within the target group of 18 to 29-year-olds,
the possibility of serving in the Defence organisation on a temporary appointment is by
no means common knowledge. Only 45 percent of the indigenous target group and 33
percent of the ethnic minorities target group are aware of it. The same study has shown
that young people from ethnic minorities are more interested in a job in the armed
forces than are indigenous youngsters. Much of the potential in this segment of the
labour market is up to now unused.

In view of the importance of image, labour market communication will be improved.
Defence will also portray itself more vigorously as an employer (interesting jobs offering

conducted to ascertain the profile of the target group from which Defence must draw in
the coming years. Defence must get a better idea of what the current generation of 15 16-year-olds think about work and training.

Defence must improve the way in which it functions. This will also help to ensure that
Defence is regarded as an appealing, professional organisation offering good jobs. The
new personnel policy will also improve the quality of the organisation. If Defence has
faith in its own organisation it will present itself confidently, which will benefit its allure
on the labour market. This is necessary in order to have the right people in the right
place for the often difficult tasks facing the armed forces.

**Concrete objectives for change**

In consultations between the government and parliament, ever more attention is paid to
concrete change objectives on the basis of which the cabinet is subsequently better
able to fulfil its obligations of accountability with regard to the implemented policy.
Against this background, concrete change objectives stemming from the Defence White
Paper have been drawn up below.

The main change objectives for the functioning of the Defence organisationare:

   - he full implementation before 2003 of the measures announced in the context
of the Process of Change in the Defence Organisation:

   - a strengthened Political Consultative Group and an improved system of
reporting on the basis of clearly formulated objectives, with a view to reinforcing
central

direction;

   - the strengthening of the role of the Inspector-General of the Armed Forces;

   - improved external communication;

   - coping efficiently with exceptional occurrences;

   - central leadership of peace operations and strengthening of the integral
planning

by the Chief of the Defence Staff;

   - a uniform framework for the completion of peace operations;

   - improved structure for the internal provision of information;

    - accountability by senior officials.

   - he completion in 2001 of the 25% reduction of the number of policy and policy
support functions in the core department. This reduction is to be implemented
from 1998 - 2003 in the Hague headquarters of the Services.

    - he strengthening in the near future of the central direction for the realisation of
major high-cost equipment projects. The Commanders in Chief are directly
accountable in this regard to the political leaders. There will be a direct
information line between the project leaders in the Services and the DirectorGeneral for Materiel. Against this backdrop, the Defence Materiel Selection
Process will be evaluated in 2000.

   - start will soon be made on a competitive service provision programme for
Defence Telematics Organisation, the Defence Infrastructure Agency, the
Topographic Service of the Netherlands, the Central Mechanical Maintenance
and Repair Facility, the Defence Organisation for Recruitment and Selection and
the Personnel and Salary Administration. The higher echelon maintenance
agencies of the RNLAF and the RNLN, and the occupational health & safety
services of the RNLN, RNLA and RNLAF will soon join the programme, as will the
remaining support services.

   - he operational management policy will be fully implemented, on the assumption
that complete support for operational management with integral and standardised
information systems will be provided as of 2006.

   - he increase in expenditure for Defences environmental policy by an amount
rising to NLG 20 million in 2003.

**Objectives for change with regard to operational management**

Over the course of 2000, all units down to sector level and result-responsible units
(abbreviated to RVE in Dutch) will have the authorities and assets in order for those in
positions of authority at that level to be able to bear integral responsibility for
implementation of their allocated tasks.

The budget for 2001 must include transparent objectives down to RVE level.

As of the budget for 2003, all index figures must be developed for measuring the
realisation of the objectives. It must be possible to present these figures in the budget.

In 2001, all RVEs will have their own expenditure budgets and quantity budgets with
regard to services (with respect to large support units).

an independent factor in considering the deployment of assets in relation to the
realisation of products and services.

The creation of an audit function, and its related capacity, is the responsibility of the line
management of the policy areas. As of 2001, all organisation units up to RVE level must
have an audit plan.

Having established the Defence-wide operating processes, from 2006 onwards there
must be an integral and standardised operating process system which is to be
introduced in phases, for the time being within the materiel-logistic units.

of the Royal Marechaussee Policy and Operational Management 2000 project.

   - mplementation in 2000 of the integral plan of approach for, among other things,
the management of the Royal Marechaussee, the reorganisation of the
headquarters and the personnel complement; NLG 35 million is needed for this in
the next ten years.

   - ompletion of personnel additions by 400 Royal Marechaussee personnel due to
task intensification with regard to the mobile monitoring of aliens, control at the
Schengen areas outer borders and for registration centres for asylum seekers. In
2000 and 2001, training for this expansion will be intensified such that three
groups of ninety personnel members will be available more quickly.

   - xpansion of the training capacity and, consequently, adaptation of the
infrastructure of the Royal Marechaussee Training Centre (abbreviated to
OCKMar in Dutch) in Apeldoorn in the period 2001 - 2007. The other OCKMar
location, the Detmers Barracks, will be disposed of in 2006.

Marechaussee Squadron (mobilisable), which are currently part of the Royal
Netherlands Army are to be assigned to the Royal Marechaussee.

The major objectives for change for personnelare:

   - he introduction in 2000 of a new management form for the officer training
courses at the Royal Naval College (KIM), the Royal Military Academy (KMA) and
the Netherlands Defence College (IDL). A joint Faculty of Military Science which
will contain lecturers from the Royal Naval College and the Royal Military
Academy is to be set up. A separate training programme will be created for Royal
Marechaussee officers.

   - he introduction of a new personnel system in the period 2000 - 2009, by which
fixed-term contractors will make up 60% of the personnel and indefinite
contractors 40%; the current ratio is the other way round. This will reduce the age
of the personnel complement.

   - reduction in the claim laid on personnel in the framework of international
operations. Thanks to the expansion of the rapidly deployable combat-ready units
in the armed forces, the norm will become a maximum of a six-month mission
abroad in each eighteen-month period.

   - n increase in the contribution from reserve personnel to peacekeeping
operations. This chiefly involves deployment of medical personnel and personnel
for transport tasks, the Naval Control of Shipping Organisation and civil-military
cooperation during peacekeeping operations.
