The National Strategy shall be employed as a framework for formulating consistent and integrated plans in a congruous drive to achieve the aforementioned goal in accordance with the rules and procedures enumerated by national strategy legislation. In this context, the National Strategy Act B.E. 2560 (2017 C.E.) was drawn up and the National Strategy Committee (NSC) has been mandated to develop the draft National Strategy. The Act also specifies procedures for public participation in formulation of the National Strategy, including monitoring, inspection and evaluation, and measures for encouraging and supporting all civic sectors to comply with the National Strategy.
 Abiding by the National Strategy Act B.E. 2560 (2017 C.E.), the NSC has set up
 six National Strategy Drafting Committees, each mandated to develop a set of key strategies in line with set criteria, methodology and requirements. The NSC also conducted public hearing meetings, as required by the law, to encourage relevant government agencies and the public to share their opinions, which were incorporated into the drafting of the National Strategy. 
 The National Strategy (2018-2037) is the country’s first national long-term
 strategy developed pursuant to the Constitution. It shall be pursued to ensure that the country achieves its vision of becoming “a developed country with security, prosperity and sustainability in accordance with the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy” with the ultimate goal being all Thai people’s happiness and well-being.

#### Current Situations and Future Direction 
 of Thailand’s Development


###### Currently, Thailand is facing several challenges impeding national development.
 In the economic context, the economic structure has yet to be fully driven by innovative technology, while productivity in both the agricultural and service sectors remains relatively low and the Thai workforces do not yet meet expected requirements and demands of the labor market. On social issues, many obstacles urgently need to be tackled in order to raise people’s income levels, address poverty and income inequality, and enhance public service quality and accessibility. Regarding the country’s environment and natural resource, preservation and restoration of natural resources and the environment continue to be key factors for ensuring sustainable development. With respect to administrative efficiency, the public sector’s efficiency, continuity and flexibility in response to civic problems still need to be improved. 

 In addition, Thailand has been facing with other rapid changes, be it the
 aging society, disruptive technology, changes in international relations in terms of security and the national economy, more complex connectivity due to regional integration and liberalization in different sectors as well as climate change and ecological degradation. All these factors have generated challenges in terms of national security, economic, social and environmental aspects of national development. Therefore, Thailand needs a comprehensive strategic plan that will help steer national development on a proper path towards security, prosperity and sustainability.
