###### MINISTER’S FOREWORD

Thanks to God Almighty, The Indonesian Defence White Paper
mandated by the National Defence Act No. 3 of 2002 has been accomplished
with the contribution of all stakeholders.

As the largest archipelago country in the world, Indonesia, located
between two oceans and two continents has a unique geographical position.
This requires Indonesia to strategize its position carefully. This unique position
places Indonesia centrally amongst its ten neighbouring countries sea and
land borders. Indonesia’s territorial seas are important for Indonesia’s
international trade. This results in Indonesia being vulnerable to security
threats. As an archipelago and maritime country, Indonesia is very interested


-----

###### MINISTER’S FOREWORD

in creating security in the region, including maritime security in order to support
the Indonesia’s interests as the Global Maritime Fulcrum (GMF). Therefore,
Indonesia’s management of natural resources, its border region, and defence
is required.

In the context of international relations, Indonesia has been prioritized
free and active foreign policy, and is guided by the principle of peace and a

passion for independence and sovereignty. Indonesia assumes its neighbouring
countries are friendly countries who shared commitment in maintaining regional
security and stability. An important priority of Indonesia is to work cooperatively
within the region to problem solve and encourage peace in accordance with
United Nations Charter fundamental principles.

Strategic environment dynamics can bring changes to a complex
spectrum of threats that have implications for national defence. The complexity
of threats is multi-dimensional, military, non-military and hybrid threat which
can be classified as factual and non-factual. In consequence, Indonesia’s
National Defence requires an integrated military and non-military approach
which strives to build a strong and respected national defence with a high
deterrence capability.

National defence is managed in a total defence system to achieve its
national goals. The system is essentially a defence involving all citizens in

accordance with their roles and functions. The involvement of every citizen
in national defence is in-line-with the 1945 Constitution of the Republic
of Indonesia. A State Defence Programme, or defined as _Bela Negara_
programme, is implemented within the next decade and expected to reach
100 million citizens who are militant. This programme will continually develop
the needs of national defence.

###### MINISTER’S FOREWORD

This Defence White Paper is an updated editions and is defence
policy statement as a guideline for the implementation of national defence;
it is expected to meet the challenges and needs of stakeholders and the
public who are required to understand the national defence policy. This White
Paper is distributed to the public, both domestically and internationally, as an
instrument to establish defence cooperation with other countries in order to
build mutual trust, equality, and respect.

As the Minister of Defence of the Republic of Indonesia, I express my
appreciation and gratitude to all who have participated and contributed to the
delivery of this Defence White Paper.

May God Almighty always give grace and guidance to the beloved Nation
of Indonesia.

###### PREFACE

1.1 Today’s global security and strategic
environment influences national defence. One
of the dynamics which needs to be observed
during the next five years is economic
growth and how it affects regional military
power enhancement. The dynamics greatly
affect the pattern and form of threat which is
increasingly complex and multidimensional
with the continued presence of military and
non-military threat, and hybrid threat which
can be categorized as factual and non-factual.
These threats include terrorism, radicalism,
separatism and armed rebellions, natural
disasters, border violations, sea piracy and
natural resources theft, epidemics, cyber
attacks and espionage, trafficking and drug
abuse as well conventional war or armed
conflicts. In country conditions cannot be
separated from the influence of the strategic
environment triggered by ideology, political,
economical, socio-cultural, and security
factors. These developments become
challenges in managing the national defence.

defence is intended to maintain and protect

The execution of Indonesia’s
national defence is intended to
maintain and protect the country’s
sovereignty, territorial integrity and
safety of the nation from national
threats. (Law No. 3/2002 on
National Defence).

National defence of Indonesia is
held within a total defence system.
A defence that is established
involving all citizens, regions, and
other national resources, which
early prepared and held in total,
integrated, directed and continued
by the Government. (Law No.
3/2002)

###### PREFACE

the country’s sovereignty, territorial
integrity and safety of the nation. The
national defence is managed in a
total defence system, which is nonaggressive and expansive to protect
national interests. To solve problems
related to and affecting the national
defence, Indonesia must prioritise
diplomacy supported by modern military

force.

Indonesia actively encourages
global partnerships, and promotes
the spirit of togetherness and
realizes a dynamic equilibrium.


To respond to every dynamic, Indonesia actively encourages
global partnerships, promotes the spirit of togetherness and
establishes a dynamic equilibrium, a condition characterized by the
absence of a dominant state power in the region. This is established
on the basis of trust as an opportunity for the increased cooperation
and partnership to enhance the nation’s defence power.

1.3 Indonesia prioritizes free and active foreign policy by referring
to the principle of independence whilst maintaining peace. Indonesia
believes that neighbouring countries are friends who have shared
commitment to promoting security and stability in the region.
Establishing a common perspective is needed to minimize the
problems faced in international relations, both bilateral and multilateral.


Developing defence power is
not intended as an arms race; it is an
effort to gain standard professionalism
of defence forces by referring to vision,
mission, Indonesia’s policy (Nawacita)
and the Global Maritime Fulcrum (GMF)
policy. To establish GMF policy, the
Government needs to build maritime
defence power supported by satellite
technology and drone systems.


The Government needs to build a
maritime defence power supported
by satellite technology and drone
systems in realizing the Global
Maritime Fulcrum policy.


-----

###### PREFACE

National defence development is executed by orienting towards
the integration of national defence, namely military and non-military
defence in order to face threats. Indonesia places the National Defence
Force (TNI) as Main Component and is reinforced by a Reserve and
Support Component to face military threats. It is capable of facing a
non-military threat by placing Ministries and Institutions outside the
field of defence as Main Elements assisted by Other National Power
Elements. These forces are capable of jointly managing a hybrid
threat.

Gradually, Indonesia will increase its national defence capability
that has the deterrent power through the posture development.
Indonesia’s national defence policy is an important consideration
when strengthening the borders around the outermost and forefront
smaller islands and establishing a reliable national defence posture.

1.4 The Defence White Paper is a mandate by Law No. 3 of 2002
on National Defence. The White Paper is a statement of national
defence policy as a whole and as a guideline for the execution of
the functions of national defence and it is disseminated to the
public, both domestically and internationally. Domestically, the white
paper is used to convey the policy of the Government in the field of
defence as a form of transparency, accountability, understanding and
awareness of national defence. Internationally, this document is used
to build confidence with other countries; this paper contains a general
overview of national defence policies, the national defence strategy,
and the national defence posture development.


Defence white paper is a comprehensive defence policy statement issued by the Ministry
of Defence and disseminated to the public, both domestically and internationally to
create mutual trust and eliminate potential conflicts. (Law No. 3/2002).

the world. It shows a continuing reflection
of the previous problems caused by various
factors.
Various strategic development issues in
the region become the attention of the world
because of the dynamic intensity. Therefore,
an understanding of the strategic environment
dynamics is an important factor in formulating
policies and strategies of national defence to

support government policy related to Maritime
Fulcrum.



  - The potential of the Asia Pacific
region as the world economic
powerhouse can be a trigger for
security challenges, both traditional
and non-traditional.


###### 2.2 Dynamics of Strategic Security Environment in the Asia Pacific Region

The Asia-Pacific region is a strategic
area in terms of economy, politics, and the
military. There are countries with more than
one billion people in this area (India and
China), modern military technology, a large
number of military human resources affecting
the economy and global politics.
In a traditional security perspective,
the Asia-Pacific region has very complex
opportunities and challenges as well as the
risk factors that can lead to conflict between
nations. South China Sea, East China Sea, the
Korean Peninsula disputes, and the tension
around some borders needs to be addressed
wisely. Meanwhile, in the non-traditional
security perspective, this region has a long
history of drug smuggling, human trafficking,


-----

###### STRATEGIC OUTLOOK

arms smuggling, sea piracy, natural resource
theft, and separatism. Terrorism issues
intensified in the last three decades due to
various factors including economic issues and
radicalism.
A very dynamic development of the
Asia-Pacific region will impact on economic
and security issues. The development needs
to be observed and affects the security and

stability is China’s economy and military
policies, strategic policy of the United States
(US) in the region, and South China Sea
disputes.
Chinese economic growth enables the
country to modernize its military. This condition
makes speculation and varied responses
coming from countries in the region and it also
creates worry about the military balance, thus,
it can be a security dilemma for countries in
the region.

The US rebalancing policy in the
Asia Pacific region reached through three
initiatives, namely: security through the
presence of military power, economy through
the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) to make
a balance of the Regional Comprehensive
Economic Partnership (RCEP) as well as
diplomacy engagement.


Google


South China Sea disputes involving
several countries may affect the stability of
security in the Asia Pacific region. This region
has a very strategic geographic position and
a high economic value of natural resources.


The existence of the United States
and China in the South China Sea
issue should not affect security
conditions, but it can increase
economic growth, prosperity,
stability, and peace in the region.


-----

###### STRATEGIC OUTLOOK


Some countries
in the Asia-Pacific region has made
efforts to modernize their defence
forces, in line with the better
economic growth.

Google

Modernization of military force is
influenced by the advancement of
defence technology.


Geographic position is the cruising lines
and international communications, while the
potential of natural resources is likely to be
explored.
South China Sea disputes have the
potential to become an (open) armed conflict
caused by: the parties involved in the South
China Sea dispute who often use the military
instrument to strengthen their claim, the

involvement of countries outside the region in
the conflict, and there being no institution or
credible international organization in resolving
the dispute. Instead, armed conflict will not
happen because ASEAN member states have
made commitments amongst of themselves
in the settlement of the conflict without using
armed violence. This decision was reached
through dialogue and brotherhood based on
mutual understanding, respect, and trust.

###### 2.3 Modernization of Military Power

Some countries in the Asia-Pacific
region have modernized their defence forces
supported by better economic growth. The
purpose is not only to be equal and achieve
standardization of the alliance system, but
also to anticipate the uncertainty.
Weapon systems modernization
and a provocative placement can lead
to miscalculations and misperceptions.
Judgement errors on an event can create
a complex and dangerous situation, mainly

associated with the potential for the ongoing
conflicts in the region, such as in the East and
South China Seas.
Modernization of military power is also
influenced by the progression of defence
technology. Some countries in the region
have taken advantage of these technologies
to modernize strategic and conventional
weapons systems and modern integrated

sensing systems. Some examples are
Command, Control, Communications,
Computers, Intelligence, Observation and
Reconnaissance, and cyber defence systems,
specifically about cyber, today’s cyber war
has become a strategy to cause losses on the
strategic impact of a country.

###### 2.4 Inter-State Border Issues


Google


The Asia Pacific region still has
the potential for border disputes must be
addressed. Empirical fact indicates that one
of the main causes of the war is borders issue.
Conflict and the ongoing crisis in this context
can increase the occurrence of traditional
threats, if this is not managed cooperatively.
As a very open archipelago, Indonesia
has a number of unresolved border issues.
In addition, Indonesian has 92 outermost
islets; 12 which require priority management
so the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
the Republic of Indonesia can be secured
optimally. This condition may potentially cause


Indonesia has 92 outmost small
islands where the 12 islands of

management priority so that the

###### STRATEGIC OUTLOOK

the violation of the territorial sovereignty of
the Republic of Indonesia, as it relates to
land borders which do not have a collective
agreement and the outermost islet where
management development is on going.
Violation of Indonesia’s sovereignty in the
airspace and sea can cause tension and has
potential to conflict.

Indonesia has a moral responsibility to promote world peace as a translation of the 1945 constitution.

###### 2.5  Intra and Inter-State Conflicts

Intra and inter-State conflicts are still
occurring in some regions of the world.
Internal conflicts still happen in Africa, the
Middle East, Eastern European and Western
European countries, with potential increase
for civil war causing the exodus of population.
Generally, conflict is triggered by political
competition, power, discontent and injustice,
access competition for resources, oppression,
corruption and the problem of the absence of
democracy. Some of these conflict triggers
can be transformed into the Asia Pacific
region.


-----

###### STRATEGIC OUTLOOK

Intrastate conflicts tend to escalate and
transform significantly. The conflict happening
in some areas of North Africa, Central Africa,
Israel-Palestine, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan,
South Asia, Southeast Asia, East Asia and
Europe are still occurring resulting in peaceful
solution being difficult to accomplish. Likewise,
international conflicts potentially occur in the
East Asia region in which their resolutions

require new approaches and do not use
violent approaches that could threaten the
stability and peace in the Asia Pacific.

###### 2.6 Contemporary Conflict Tendency

Currently, the armed conflict pattern
is undergoing significant changes and
affects the influences of the general trend of
contemporary conflict in the world. It is because
of military technology development, the desire
to reduce casualties, high cost of war and the
increasingly strict application of the rules of
international laws and conventions.
Patterns to occupy the space are no
longer executed frontally but are executed by
means of nonlinear, indirect, and it is a proxy
war. Trends to occupy a country by using
asymmetric ‘weapons’ built systematically,
such as Syrian conflict and Ukraine war
is increasing. To create conditions by
propaganda executed by utilizing information
technology advances and cyber space as
social media.

Serious problems related to the

contemporary conflict is an internal conflict growth

that could trigger separatist movements because

of political and regional interests; including the

social conflict happening in some countries

against the backdrop of social dynamics, culture,

primordial, ethnic, race, and religion.

The pattern of divide et impera or
divide the components of the internal nation

is an effective way to destroy a country. As
it happened in the Arab Spring phenomenon,
the political and security turmoil in Egypt,
as well as the civil war in Iraq, Afghanistan,
Libya, and Syria to prove the existence of a
pattern of the conflict.


The use and dissemination of
harmful materials of CBRN-E could
potentially pose a threat to the
security and safety of mankind.


###### 2.7 Weapons of Mass Destruction Issue

Science and technology development in
the field of Chemical, Biological, Radiological,
Nuclear, and Explosives (CBRNE) simul­
taneously with the advancement of trans­
portation and communication of information
has increased the control, utilization, and the
spread of which it essentially can be used
for the benefit of human welfare. However,
those hazardous materials have the potential
to threaten human security and safety when
it is controlled by the irresponsible party.
The vulnerability is confirmed that there are
still some countries producing hazardous
materials and are not transparent. It poses a
threat to other countries.


-----

###### STRATEGIC OUTLOOK

The spread of dangerous substances

illegally through trade, trespassing, can cause

vulnerability to the security of Indonesia’s national

defence, especially in today’s era. Therefore, it is

crucial this is managed and controlled properly.


###### 2.8 Terrorism

Terrorism is a global security central
issue utilizing information technology
development through social networks to
strengthen its global network in order to obtain
weapons, financial support as well as location
for concealment.
Global terrorism action, as the radical
movement, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria
(ISIS), is clear evidence that terrorism has
become a powerful act of violence in the name
of a radicalism. It aims to attack the regime
that controverts the paradigm believed. In
addition, there are other radical groups
developing which are affiliated or inspired by
the ideology of Al-Qaeda including the Home
grown Terrorist and Returning Fighters.

###### 2.9 Espionage

Espionage is a data and information
collection activities conducted by a state
against another in order to obtain information
and strategic documents through various
means and methods. Nowadays, evolving

strategic environment is very dynamic,
uncertain and complex, therefore it makes very
difficult for any country to assess the potential
and the nature of the threats and challenges
to its national interests. Therefore, each
country will try to get information and strategic
documents through various espionages.

###### 2.10 Transnational Crime

Today’s transnational crime is
considered as an important threat to global
security. In Southeast Asia, this crime is a
serious threat to the stability and security, thus
it becomes vulnerable to security and stability.
In accordance with the implementation of the
ASEAN action plan in combating transnational
crime (Programme to Implement the ASEAN
Plan of Action to Combat Transnational
Crime), it states that there are several types
of transnational crime such as illicit drugs
trafficking, human trafficking, piracy, weapons
smuggling, money laundering, terrorism,
international banking crime and cybercrime.
Drug crimes which can be related to
the source of funding for terrorist groups
and separatism becomes a common and
serious threat besides, transnational crimes.
Transnational crime development has grown
significantly from a region, radical groups and
organized crime.
Considering that crime phenomenon

has been consistent with its efforts to uphold
law enforcement to protect its citizens from
transnational crime.

###### 2.11 Science and Technology Development

Science and technology development
affect the shape and pattern of future war.
Although the asymmetric patterns and forms
of war are still occouring in some areas,
conventional war weapons technology still
evolves rapidly. The future war increasingly
considers the impact reduction of the
damage and casualties among civilians by
applying high-accuracy weapons technology
and robot technology application of various
weapons systems in order to reduce the
use and deployment of personnel and
armaments.
Information and communication

change, ecosystem change, rising sea levels,
changing uncertain seasons, increased
rainfall, droughts, storms and hurricanes.
These trends have a direct and indirect
impact on the basic needs of human beings,

especially food, water, health and energy.
Climate change will affect the security
issues indirectly. Non-fulfilment human life
basic needs will cause disruption resilience
and environment adaptability leading to
insecurity. It also affects the dynamics of
politics, economy, water and food crisis,
the emergence of pandemic disease, the
migration and conflict.

###### 2.13 Natural Disaster

Indonesia is located amongst three
active earth plates, namely Indo-Australian
plate, the Eurasian plate and the Pacific plate
and traversed by an active world mountain
path that is Pacific and Mediterranean Circum.
This makes Indonesia a part of the ‘Ring of
Fire’ or world Pacific ring of fire which is an
active mountain path, therefore Indonesia
is susceptible to volcanic and tectonic
earthquakes.
The potential impact of natural disasters
on people’s lives consist of tsunamis,
earthquakes, floods, cyclones, droughts,

will require additional food. In future, it is
estimated there will be food shortages
caused by environmental destruction, land
conversion, the high price of fossil fuels and
climate change.
Reducing agricultural land as a result
of population growth and rapid human need
as well as reduced human farm manager
resources is an important factor causing
food resilience. Food dependency between
countries is predicted will develop accordance
with the increase of population.
The water crisis becomes a phenomenon
caused by uncontrolled handling the
environment and natural assets. Uncontrolled
management of fresh water resources causes
deterioration in the quality and availability of
clean water sources.
The need of energy is getting higher
year to year. The population growth, the
pace of industrial development, as well as
the increasing flow of goods and services
cause high energy need. By the decreasing
of energy resources and the ineffectiveness
of energy source diversity efforts thus it is
estimated oil and gas become a contested
strategic resource.
The food, water and energy crisis is a
potential trigger for conflict. An issue such
strategic resources can be a new source of
conflicts and it encourages conflicts of interest,
especially if it fails in its management.

 2.17  Future Threats Estimation

Threats are major factors which contribute to the preparation
of a national defence system design, both actual and potential. It
is based on a strategic analysis and identification of the nature of
the very dynamic threats; thus it allows various threats to combine.
Hence, the current and future threats can be classified into three
types: hybrid threats, military threats (armed and unarmed) and
non-military threats. The sources of threats may or may not be from

Indonesia and re executed by state and non-state actors, national,
regional, and international. As for the impact of covering all aspects
of social conditions consisted of ideological, political, economic,
social, cultural, defence and security. Within five years, according to
the priority, then these threats are categorized as factual and nonfactual threat.

A factual threat is a known threat which
may occur at any time, the threat may or may not

national sovereignty, territorial integrity and safety
risks. The factual threat is a threat prioritized in
handling terrorism and radicalism, separatism
and armed uprisings, natural disasters, border
trespassing, piracy and natural resources theft,

epidemics, cyber attacks and espionage, as well

**Non-Factual Threat**
A Non-factual threat is an open conflict threat or a conventional
war in which the power of the armed forces of each country oppose
each other. The United Nations Charter articulates that all countries
in the world should be committed to mutual respect for sovereignty
and national interests of each other.  Therefore it is unlikely to affect
Indonesia at present and in the future. Nonetheless, as a nation that
has tremendous potential, alertness must be maintained because of
dynamic threats, which have the potential to become factual, when

the national interest and honor is disturbed.
