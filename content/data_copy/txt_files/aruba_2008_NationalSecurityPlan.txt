### 1. INTRODUCTION

_“The future is not to be predicted, but created.”_

─Arthur C. Clarke

1.1 In today‘s day and age where the world is ever more vulnerable to threats of farreaching proportions, it is imperative that a nation is prepared to deal with challenges,
both anticipated and unexpected, with readiness and preparedness. Even more than
being prepared for the unexpected, is to know where one is heading as a nation. In
times of rapid change, it is critical to know which direction to steer towards and having
the information and tools to stay the course.

1.2 This kind of approach is demanded more and more by international funding agencies

who are moving away from funding ad hoc, stand-alone projects and encouraging a
more programmatic and strategic approach to planning. To meet these demands, the
Aruba Dept. of Economic Affairs set out to create a National Security Plan that would
articulate an overarching vision for national security. This long-term vision for national
security would provide the direction and the framework for completing the 2008-2012
rechtshandhaving‖ (law and order) program to be funded by the Dutch Development
Cooperation (funds of the ―schuldensanering‖) through the FDA (Fondo di Desaroyo di
Aruba).

1.3 A participatory strategic planning process was employed to arrive at this National
Security Plan. The aim and intention of the participatory planning process was to
create a collectively agreed upon direction for national security with different sectors
beyond law enforcement, and a set of priority focus areas that would ultimately help to
achieve the articulated vision. Therefore, a wider net was cast to include not only
representatives of the law enforcement and justice sector but also those of relevant
agencies and departments directly related to and affected by national security and
safety issues.

1.4 Why a participatory planning approach? A participatory planning approach:

 Allows for a input from a broader section of society.
 Involves active participation in shared thinking, dialoguing, searching for solutions

and creating recommendations.

 Gives a platform for a wide array of voices to be heard, thereby reflecting the

reality from a broader perspective.

 Provides a vehicle for practicing and gaining experience in collaboration and

cooperation across professional and departmental boundaries.

 Enables people to learn more about themselves and each other from the process

of working together.

 Creates greater public ownership so that recommended actions stand a greater

chance for implementation.

1.5 The anticipated benefits of utilizing a participatory planning process are:

 a shared direction in national security;
 a consensus of current reality in terms of national assets and threats;
 greater alignment of government departmental efforts to enhance national

security;

 an experience of cross-boundary team work, collaboration and support.

### Organization of this Plan

1.6 This plan is organized as follows:

 **Chapter 1: Introduction**

 **Chapter 2: Where Are We? This chapter presents a snapshot of the current**

reality in terms of threats to Aruba‘s context of security. This snapshot in time
was assembled through individual interviews, group work and multiple feedback
loops with professionals in the law and order chain as well as beyond into a wider
network, including government, the private and civic sector. The major threats to
national security are placed within a definition of security that is multidimensional.

 **Chapter 3: Where Do We Want To Go? This chapter presents a new vision for**

national security 2020 as articulated by the network of professionals described in
Chapter 2 and refined through multiple cycles of feedback and revision.

 **Chapter 4: What Do We Focus On? This chapter provides a brief overview of**

bilateral agreements to date that form the foundation for this plan and provide the
continuity for this subsequent cycle of funding. It provides the goals and
objectives within a broader direction outlined by the new national security vision
2020.

 **Chapter 5: How Do We Get There? This chapter provides a listing of identified**

projects and draws its contents from projects and activities submitted by
departments of the ―RHH Keten‖ (law and order process chain), professionals
representing national crisis management, and youth issues. The projects are set
within the framework of goals and objectives to reach the new vision. It also
provides a suggestion for an implementation structure that will ensure that
projects are executed and monitored according to plan.

 **Chapter 6: How Will We Know We Got There?** This chapter provides a

tabulated organization of desired outcomes and indicators of progress for each
program result area.

### 2. WHERE ARE WE?

_“The biggest security threats we face now, and in the decades ahead, go far beyond States waging_

_aggressive war. They extend to poverty, infectious disease and environmental degradation; war and_

_violence within States; the spread and possible use of nuclear, radiological, chemical and biological_

_weapons; terrorism; and transnational organized crime.”_

──High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, UN Report, December 2, 2004

2.1 To understand where we are in terms of national security, it is important to first define

what we mean by national security. How Aruba defines the term ―national security‖ is a
result of a process of dialogue and cycles of feedback among representatives of a
broader net of relevant departments and agencies as well as the law and order chain.
The definition provides a framework within which to place the most prominent threats to
national security as perceived by this network of stakeholders in Aruba. These threats
to national security provide the compelling reasons for the planning of aligned action to
mitigate the threats to national security.

2.2 This report draws its contents from 6 sources: (1) individual interviews conducted with

a number of stakeholders in the Justice sector, (2) mini surveys conducted with a
broad net of stakeholders, (3) group work and participation in a planning workshop on
Oct. 30; (4) 3 cycles of survey feedback post workshop to refine and consolidate the
articulation of a vision for national security; (5) relevant government reports; and (6)
relevant website literature review.

### A Definition of National Security 

2.3 The definition of national security in this plan is defined as multi-dimensional.[1] In

general terms, the national security of Aruba involves protection against external
**threats to our land and internal threats to the integrity of the political, economic,**
**social and environmental fabric of our nation. The reference point is both the**
security of the land, waters and airspace of Aruba and the safety of its people and
visitors. Security and the perception of safety lie at the foundation of the Aruban sense
of trust and connection to each other.

2.4 The vital interests of Aruba must be safeguarded so that as our society‘s internal fabric

undergoes changes, it grows in the direction of strength and resilience, and not chaos.
Specifically, our national security includes protecting and safeguarding the following 5
vital interests:

1. **Territorial security: this requires that Aruba is protected by Dutch Kingdom**

military presence, bilateral and tri-partite agreements between Aruba, the
Netherlands and other Kingdom partners, and regional and international diplomacy
against foreign aggression as well as terrorism. As part of the Kingdom of the
Netherlands, Aruba also falls within NATO vigilance.

1 National Security is conceived to extend beyond the traditional concerns of territorial integrity and military security to include
relevant elements from the human security concept (protection from chronic threats such as hunger, disease and repression;
(2) protection against sudden or violent disturbances in the way of life; and (3) seven sub-areas─economic, political, food,
health, environmental, personal and community. 1993 UNDP Human Development Report.


-----

2. **Economic security: this requires that the main economic driver of the island,**

tourism, is protected and that alternative sources of economic income are
intensively explored and developed to diversify our economy and lessen our
economic vulnerability. Relying on the tourist industry as the sole pillar of Aruban
economy, places Aruba in a position of severe vulnerability and dependency on
external forces. When trade with the US, the Netherlands and other countries is
interrupted, this also poses a threat to the economic security of our nation.

3. **Political security: this requires that Aruba is ruled by good governance practices**

(including an up-to-date and enforced legal framework) ensuring that the
democratic rule of law is upheld so that the people of Aruba and visitors can rest
assured that there is political stability and that their basic human rights are honored
_(e.g., right to vote, speech, security, safety from violence, protection from the law,_
_to think freely, to peacefully protest (speak against) a government or group, to a_
_basic standard of living, education and health). Good governance practices_
include transparency, integrity and ensuring that institutions representing ―checks
and balances‖ operate properly.

4. **Environmental security: this requires that there is a legal framework in place that**

assures the people of Aruba protection from the short-and long-term damages of
nature _(hurricanes and other), of man-made threats to the environment and_
deterioration of nature _(e.g., access to clean water, air pollution from carbon_
_emissions from cars, littering and garbage dumping in the mondi’s, burning of_
_garbage, etc.). Environmental security also requires a closer examination of the_
major industrial air polluting source (oil refinery) on the island in terms of
compliance with the 2005 Kyoto Protocol to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide in
the air and other international agreements (such as Cartagena, Rotterdam,
Montreal to name a few).

5. **Social (community and personal) security: this requires that the people of**

Aruba (including the youth), community groups _(different nationality groups), and_
visitors are protected from physical violence whether from the nation of Aruba or
external states, from violent individuals and sub-state actors, from domestic abuse,
or from predatory individuals, young or old. It requires that all individuals have
access to opportunities for social and economic mobility through the means of
education, work and social aid. Stability and cohesion of the social fabric directly
relates to the degree of social integration of groups of people who can live together
in a democratic constitutional state. The rapidly changing demographics of Aruba
and the high numbers of unintegrated, lowly paid immigrant workers in all sectors
of society sow seeds of alienation among short-term immigrants that pose a threat
to the socio/cultural fabric of this small society.

2.5 This multi-dimensional framework provides a conceptual container within which to

understand the threats to national security identified by respondents in this planning
exercise. They follow next.

### Threats to National Security

2.4 Representatives of the broader community and individuals from the law and order

chain were asked, through individual interviews and subsequent cycles of surveys, to
identify threats to national security. The overall perception was that the time was right
to build on initiatives undertaken since 2005 and continue to invest in strengthening the
national security of Aruba. Respondents identified 6 main threats that deserve focused
attention in order to remain preventative in focus. Below are the top 6 threats to
national security that professionals in the ―RHH Keten‖, the law and order process
chain, selected from a list generated by a selected group of professionals in the
private, social, education and government sectors:

1. quality of governance and leadership;
2. economic vulnerability and dependency on tourism as main economic pillar;
3. weakening of a collective sense of community values and responsibilities;
4. international drug trafficking/business and effects on community safety;
5. quality of education; and
6. preparedness for unexpected disasters.

2.5 These threats affect different dimensions of national security (see Figure 1 below).

According to professionals surveyed in the law and order sector as well as wider, the
broadest threat to national security covering all 5 vital interests are #1 quality of
_governance and leadership and_ #6 _preparedness of unexpected disasters. The next_
broadest category of threat is #2 economic vulnerability and dependency on tourism as
_main economic pillar_ and #5 _quality of education, followed by_ #3 _weakening of a_
_collective sense of community values and responsibilities_ and #4 international drug
_trafficking/ business and effects on community safety. Each of these top 6 threats,_
though presented individually for ease of treatment, must be understood however as
an inter-related constellation of relationships. Each threat is related to each other and
affects each other. Each will be briefly elaborated below.

2.6 **Security Threat #1: Governance and Leadership. Political stability, the mandate to**

safeguard the citizen‘s rights and safety, and the management of the nation‘s
resources are dependent on strong and committed political leadership for the common
good of the country. Good governance[2] and the capacity of the country‘s public
administration system have long been recognized to be critical factors in ensuring a
high success rate in policy formulation and project implementation (Bhatta, and
_Gonzalez III,1999)._ Because of this lesson learned from decades of project planning
and implementation by donor agencies, multi-lateral as well as bilateral aid agencies
worldwide have included a focus on governance as part of the overall institutional
reform of public sector as a precondition for project implementation success and
sustainability. Indeed, project implementation experience in Aruba confirms this.

2.7 **_Currently Ongoing Initiatives:_**

On Sept. 24, 2003 the first bilateral agreement was signed between Aruba and the
Netherlands to collaborate on improving Law and Order (henceforth referred to by its
_Dutch term RHH) in Aruba. This agreement resulted in a program of activities, called_
the Samenwerkings programma Rechtshandhaving (RHH) ─ Aruba 2005-2007, with a
total commited funding of AFl. 15 million financed by the Netherlands and Aruba
Governments.  The goal was to uphold the democratic rule of law (democratische
rechtsorde) and ensure the organizational effectiveness of all institutions responsible
for maintaining public law and order, and security in Aruba (e.g., OM, KPA, VDA,
Immigration, Customs, KIA, MOT, etc.) through:

    - Improvement of the information management system and exchange in the
various institutes in the law and order chain;

    - A more effective monitoring of persons, goods and transportation along the island
boundaries;

    - Quantitative and qualitative adjustments of the Meldpunt Ongebruikelijke
Transacties (MOT); and

    - Implementation and actualizing of required laws and regulations.

These priority goal areas of the 2005-2007 RHH bilateral agreement have been
translated into 3 desired program results to ensure optimal functioning of law and order
in Aruba:

1. more intensive collaboration between departments related to RHH;
2. strengthening of departments responsible for RHH; and
3. legal reform related to RHH.

These are currently in various phases of project implementation.

Government Multi-year Programs 2001-2005 and 2006-2009 respectively, focus on
good governance practices as a priority area. Ongoing projects, which are currently in
various phases of project implementation, include for example, improving the integrity
of government agencies, data-based decision-making through capacity building in

2
Some universally accepted fundamental bases of good governance include:

  - A focus on the capacities of the state as well as the civil society, because the assumption is that the state cannot, and

should not, try to do all;

 - A focus on methods of participation in decision-making and consensus-building (emphasizing the democratic nature of

governance);

 - A recognition of the pivotal role of non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations; and

  - An emphasis on partnerships in the market economy (with the general assumption being that, left to its own devices, the

market will not necessarily create the right conditions for everybody to be involved in it, nor benefit from its operation).
(Bhatta and Gonzalez III, 1999)

statistical analysis systems, modernization of antiquated laws, and institutionalizing
planning capacity at the national level (the National Integral Sustainability Plan).

2.8 As implementation proceeded, it became clear that initially allocated funding proved

inadequate to fully address a number of urgent areas of priorities. To address the 2
most critical areas of priority in law and order─the improvement of the Aruba Police
_Force (KPA) and the Immigration Services (Vreemdelingenketen)─the Governments of_
Aruba and the Netherlands signed two separate bilateral agreements. They are the
_Protocol van samenwerking ter verbetering van het functioneren van het Korps Politie_
_Aruba, Sept. 2006_ and the _Memorandum of Understanding inzake de versterkte_
_samenwerking van Aruba en Nederland ter verbetering van het functioneren van de_
_vreemdelingenketen van Aruba, July 2007. These agreements with politically_
committed funding cover two critical areas of law and order identified as requiring
increased resources: the Aruba Police Force (KPA) and the Immigration Services
(Vreemdelingenketen).

2.9 These bilateral agreements are currently in various phases of project planning and

implementation. The Aruba Police Force Action Plan, ―Verbeterplan Korps Politie
_Aruba: Bouwen op de werkelijkheid, July 2007, has already been approved by the_
Aruba Council of Ministers.  This plan identifies 3 major improvement initiatives in the
areas of (1) management operations (bedrijfsvoering); (2) police services
(handhaving); and (3) police investigation (opsporing). Activities related to these 3
initiatives are included in this National Security Plan (see Chapter 5). The Immigration
Services (Vreemdelingenketen) has already submitted a technical advice report on
best options to integrate their management information system. At the current time,
the immigration services do not form an integrated operational system of related units
and a functioning Immigration Services process chain (vreemdelingenketen) does not
yet exist. Activities planned to create a seamless process of services are included in
this National Security Plan (see Chapter 5).

2.10 **Security Threat #2: Economic Vulnerability and Dependency on Tourism as Main**

**Economic Pillar.** Reliance on a single economic pillar such as tourism creates an
economy precariously vulnerable to external influences (911, escalating oil prices,
wars, epidemics, etc), changes in the weather pattern (hurricanes moving further
south), and internal crises (Natalee Holloway). The economic vulnerability stems
primarily from an overreliance on a single major source of tourists, such as North
America. Dependency on tourism as a main pillar of the economy also increases the
island‘s ecological vulnerability in terms of ―the increase of road-and air-traffic movements,
_the increase of the population pressure, and the spatial claims of the accommodation sector‖_
(Croes, 2007, p. 103). A number of respondents expressed concern about the lack of
legal environmental protection against the risk of oil spills, dumping of toxic waste and
other environmental hazardous products within our territorial waters.

2.11 **_Planned Initiatives:_**

A follow-up report on efforts to reach a healthy public finance by the National
Commission on Public Finance (NCPF) recommends that Government contain as of
2007 personnel expenses and expenses on goods and services to a 3% and 2%
growth respectively per year. It also recommends that Government gradually increase
the level of investment to 2% GDP. The Government intends to implement the
recommendations made by the NCPF with the stretch goal of reaching a balanced
budget by 2009. The Government also intends to follow recommendations of the
recent FIAS Report by the International Monetary Fund on diversifying the economy.


-----

As of January 2008, the project for engaging in a national collaborative process of
stakeholders from the Government, private and civic sector to create for the first time, a
National Integral Sustainability Plan, will enter into implementation.

**2.12 Security Threat #3: Weakening of a Collective Sense of Community Values and**

**Responsibilities. Many factors contribute to this perception of weakening of society‘s**
community values and responsibilities. The most obvious contributory factor is the
large migratory inflow to Aruba over a relatively short period of time, swelling the
[population of Aruba from 64,000 inhabitants in 1990 to 103,000 in 2005 (World](http://esa.un.org/unpp/index.asp?panel=2)
_[Population Prospects: The 2006 Revision Population Database).  In 2001, 41% of the](http://esa.un.org/unpp/index.asp?panel=2)_
[working age population was non-Arubian (www.paho.org/HIA/archivosvol2/paisesing](http://www.paho.org/HIA/archivosvol2/paisesing%20/Aruba%20English.pdf)
_[/Aruba%20English.pdf). The shifting of family/community values to more](http://www.paho.org/HIA/archivosvol2/paisesing%20/Aruba%20English.pdf)_
individualistic/ materialistic values is also perceived to be a worrisome trend. This shift
is manifested in the continuous weakening of traditional social controls and extended
family and support network in the community (see Appendix 2 for results of the October
_2007 National Platform of the Districts Conference).  During a recent conference of the_
Professional team districts, this was indicated as a major threat to community safety in
all the districts. In addition, district teams consisting of police, White Yellow Cross,
Social workers, the clergy and schools also indicated another 4 major challenges in all
6 districts of Aruba: (1) dysfunctional relationships within the home leading to abusive
behavior; (2) general negligence of the elderly and children/youth leading especially to
youth behavioral problems; (3) addiction problems involving drugs, alcohol, and
gambling; and (4) financial problems and criminal activity. Research summarizing
conditions that predict youth delinquency and criminality[3] indicate that family factors
play an important role.

2.13 **_Ongoing and Planned Initiatives:_**

A joint project between the Dept. of Education and the Dept. of Social Affairs, the
―Orthopedagogish Centrum‖, has recently entered into implementation. This center
provides temporary lodging under professional supervision and rehabilitative services
to youth between 12-18 with serious behavioral problems.

The _Samenwerkings programma Rechtshandhaving (RHH)_ _─ Aruba 2005-2007_ also
identifies a 5[th] area of priority:

    - Further research into the relationship between the youth, drug usage and youth
delinquency in Aruba.

This initiative has not reached implementation status during the 2005-2007
implementation period.

Feedback from professionals during this planning process indicated the youth to be
one of the greatest assets of the country, yet at the same time a cause for concern.
The weakening of family structure and community values places youth at risk and it is
therefore critical to adopt a prevention mindset and initiate a structure for national
youth policy dialogue. A focus on youth remains a priority for this funding cycle, but is
broadened beyond research to capture a formal structure that allows all relevant law
and order, government, civic and private organizations to collectively dialogue on
creating national youth policy to strengthen national security.

transport infrastructure has placed Aruba as a convenient transshipment point between
the market demands for heroin and cocaine in the United States and Europe and the
South American suppliers (OM, October 2007, p. 34). Part of the drug shipment,
however, stays behind in Aruba as payment for services rendered within the drug
circuit and this is then made available on the local market, often at very cheap prices.
Though it seems that drug related arrests have declined in the period of 2003-2006
─from 237 arrests in 2003 to 114 in 2006, as the drug business has moved out of
_Aruba─_ drug trafficking and transportation still remains frequent and varied (OM,
_October 2007, p. 37)._

2.15 The ease of drug availability on the local market is evident in the high numbers of drug

users for such a small island state. In 1997, drug usage numbered 11.000 users in a
population of 87,000. Today, the estimate of drug usage is about 10% of the total
population of about 110,000. Of the 10%, i.e., 11,000 persons, an estimated 400-500
are homeless, the so-called ―chollers‖. (OM, October 2007).  The recent National
Crime Report issued by the Prosecutor‘s Office indicates that drug related crimes
scored second in the top three most frequent committed crimes in the period of 20032006 (OM, October 2007). The effects of drug-related behavior—especially burglaries
_and breaking into parked cars to get money to buy drugs, violence as the effect of drug_
_use and violence against rival traffickers—all influence the lives of ordinary citizens and_
visitors daily. The growing presence of ―chollers‖ in neighborhoods and in the center of
the Main Street presents a constant threat to public safety and public property. The
National Crime Report indicates that if no effective interventions are applied, drug
usage, the growth of the choller population and the increase of petty crimes will only
continue to rise over time (p. 60).

2.16 **_Planned Initiatives:_**

The National Crime Report recommends that immediate initiatives be undertaken to
respond to the safety issues of ―chollers‖. This will be addressed in this plan (see
chapter 4).

2.17 **Security Threat #5: Quality of Education. The general education level** of the Aruban

population is low compared to most OECD countries. Almost 75% of the population
has achieved as its highest degree a lower vocational education (lbo) or secondary
school (mavo) education. The general level of education also falls way below the
established norm of 30% of the population with higher education as a functional
educational basis for a knowledge economy. Only 6% of the Aruban population has
achieved higher education levels; and of this low percentage, half are individuals
working in Aruba on a contract basis of 3-5 years. In terms of language spoken at
home, amongst the native Papiamento speakers only 4.9% are educated at an
academic level.[4] The low level of education and the language problems faced in the
school system fail to provide the required conditions for developing the kind of critical
consciousness and other fundamental competencies necessary to function in a
knowledge economy.

2.18 According to the National Crime Report, youth delinquents tend to have a low level of

education. Often these youth also come from single parent homes where the adults
are involved in dysfunctional relationships and children and youth are neglected.
Although data are not available, it appears that these delinquents also tend to be
school dropouts. Youth crime research[5] on youth violence predictors indicates that
there are some critical school factors that correlate with the development of youth

delinquency. Poor academic achievement and failure at ages as low as 10, and later
at 14 and 16 predicts later delinquency. Truancy and dropping out of school between
the ages of 12-14 predict violence later. Low bonding to school, low commitment to
schooling, and low educational aspirations at the ages 14-16 predicts risk for
involvement in violence. At present schooling is not compulsory in Aruba. It is in the
interest of the nation‘s national security that schooling becomes compulsory and that a
stronger relationship is created between schools and youth as a preventative means
against the development of youth criminality.

2.19 **_Currently Ongoing Initiatives:_**

In 2003, a Dept. of Education policy plan on adult education, ―Volwasseneneducatie op
_Aruba: Ontwikkelingslijnen voor de toekomst‖, was developed to upgrade the_
population by offering quality adult education programs and certification for entry into
the labor market. In 2005, Adult Education was included in the Government Multi-Year
program 2006-2009 for funding.  The implementation of this Adult Education project
has recently been approved for funding by FDA.

In addition, the following education improvement projects have received funding for the
years 2006-2009 from FDA: (1) improvement of the quality of the University of Aruba;
(2) strengthening capacities of the Aruba Teacher Training Insitute (IPA). A National
Education Plan has recently been developed by the Ministry of Education to address
the improvement of quality of education for the next 10 years with a focus on improving
the process of learning and the learning environment.

Although the vocational schools have received upgrading and improvement in the last
several years, in order to reach the desired development of a knowledge economy, it
will be critical to begin to invest more intensively in the general secondary school level,
especially Colegio Arubano (HAVO, VWO levels) which prepares students for higher
education.

2.20 **Security Threat #6: Preparedness for Unexpected Disasters. While Aruba has its**

disaster management regulations and plans in place and authorities exercise
preparedness on a regular (bi-yearly) basis, there are a number of disadvantages that
places Aruba‘s national security at risk.  It is a broad-based risk that affects the 5
dimensions of the national security framework. According to the Aruba Crisis
Management Office, Aruba faces a constellation of multiple threats[6]:

    - The region is sensitive to natural disasters: e.g., hurricanes.

    - Aruba is extremely sensitive to external shocks and any disruptions in import
supplies due to global geopolitical events puts Aruba at extreme risk. Our lifelines are 95% dependent on daily imports and in case of any disruption has a
maximum of 5 months reserves of imported foods available.

    - The oil refinery carries industrial and environmental risks. There are no
environmental regulations that monitor the level or impact of neither air pollution
emitted by smoke stacks nor the environmental degradation caused by improper
disposal of hazardous industrial waste products on the island.

    - Aruba is becoming more densely populated, thereby increasing road traffic
(approximately 57,300 vehicles in 2006) and the risk of more traffic accidents.
According to the recent 2007 National Crime Report, 5,000 traffic accidents take
place per year, leading to relatively three times as many traffic deaths and injuries
than in the Netherlands. In 2006, the number of traffic accidents reported by the
Aruba Police was 6,246, or 6.06% of the population. The local community is
insufficiently prepared for natural and/or man-made disasters.

-----

    - Currently the Aruba Fire Department lacks sufficiently adequate specialized
rescue equipment to respond to emergency situations to save the lives of victims
in life-threatening situations, especially in man-made disasters such as an
airplane crash and critical car accidents on the road.

    - Regional political conflicts are common and most regional migrations to Aruba
are due to poverty in the country of origin.

2.21 Whereas the level of preparedness and responsiveness is considered to be adequate

for small disasters (rampenbestrijding), this is not the same for the current
organizational ability to anticipate, prepare, and respond to a crisis (crisisbeheersing) in
a coordinated fashion among all the key players (fire, health, police, and the Red
Cross, environmental departments and other services, such as WEB and ELMAR). To
increase the level of preparedness, it is necessary to strengthen the institutional
capacity in the following areas:

    - Improved understanding at the government administrative and executive levels of
the meaning and definition of crisis and the kind of systemic and intense
collaborative response this demands at operational levels.

    - Improved functioning at the policy, planning and executive level of the Disaster
Advisory Council[7] and more effective coordination with the Crisis Management
Office[8] resulting in the short-term in a National Crisis Management Action Plan.

    - Improved quality of services and resources at the operational level to work
together and respond to crisis in a strategic and integrated manner.

Because preparedness for crisis and disaster touches on all dimensions of national
security, it is critical that institutional capacities are strengthened.

### Compelling Reasons for Aligned Action

2.22 Experience world-wide indicates that the security of a nation‘s livelihood and quality of

civic life are dependent on good governance practices of the government apparatus.
Specifically, good governance practices refer to the organizational processes by which
authority and control are exercised, and the institutional capacity to plan and implement
policies and carry out functions (Bhatta, and Gonzalez III,1999). It is therefore critical
to continue to build on initiatives started with the 2005-2007 RHH Program and invest
in realizing the three identified desired program results (outcomes) related to good
governance practices:

1. more intensive collaboration between departments related to RHH;
2. strengthening of departments responsible for RHH; and
3. legal reform to modernize and improve effective enforcement RHH.

In addition, the picture of the current reality also indicates a need to focus on attention
and resources in 2 additional areas of priority:

4. public safety and quality of community life; and
5. national crisis management.

7
The Disaster Advisory Council advises the Prime Minister on all issues regarding disaster management and consists of 10
representatives of disaster response departments and agencies.
8
The Crisis Management Office coordinates disaster management on behalf of the Prime Minister.


-----

2.23 The next chapter aligns these three areas of priority focus, that is (1) good governance

practices; (2) public safety and quality of life; and (3) national crisis management, and
sets it within a broad direction articulated by a new vision of national security.

### 3. WHERE DO WE WANT TO GO?

_“Leaders need to be optimists. Their vision is beyond the present.”_

─Rudy Giuliani

3.1 The present reality can be much better and in the interest of combating undesirable
developments, it is necessary to create a shared vision of what is actually a desirable,
realistic and credible future relative to national security. The Aruba Dept. of Economic
Affairs took the lead to bring together representatives from the judicial sector, social,
education, civic and private sector to articulate a shared vision for national security. It
was deemed a key first step in a programmatic approach to reaching an integrated and
holistic program of law and order (rechtshandhaving). The resulting collective vision
was refined and circulated among this group of 60 participants for further feedback and
recommendations for change. The final vision description presented in the following
section is a result of a last cycle of feedback specifically from the judicial sector
including law and order (rechtshandhaving). This vision of national security provides a
long-term direction for the nation and framework for continuing ongoing improvement
initiatives and undertaking new ones.

### Aruba National Security Vision 2020

3.2 The reason for articulating a collective vision of national security is that it provides the
nation with a purpose and clarity in terms of direction. A unified direction provides
organizations with meaning and allows for alignment of efforts. It is the North Star of
the organization that gives leadership the focus point with which to inspire its people to
perform.

3.3 The Aruba National Security Vision describes a shared ideal image of a future state. It
is a vision that describes a set of inter-related set of outcomes in the long-term. These
outcomes are defined within the framework of national security defined in 2.4 to 2.6
and is imagined to result from the successful employment of main strategies noted in
2.7.

3.4 The year projected is the year 2020. The collective Aruba vision of national security is:

#### There is no safer place than Aruba to live, work, visit and invest. 

3.5 This vision is further elaborated with 10 statements that provide a more detailed and
concrete description of how and why one would find Aruba such a safe place to live,
work, visit and invest:

1. National security against external and internal threats is judiciously guarded by

the nation‘s leadership who upholds our democratic rule of law and follows
instituted practices of good governance, integrity and transparency.


-----

2. Our national security rests on translating our core values of peace and harmony

into cooperative relations within our population, within our region, within the
Dutch Kingdom and internationally.

3. Law and order is maintained by competent, professional and trustworthy law

enforcement.

4. Citizens feel protected by a trustworthy, impartial and strong legal system that

upholds the democratic rule of law.

5. Our core values of respect and harmony are manifested in our multi-cultural

population who has learned to live together respectfully, to seek to understand
and to display friendliness to all who visit our island.

6. Because of the nation‘s investment in its intellectual capital through educational

excellence and life-long learning, the island thrives thanks to the creativity,
intelligence and spirit of a self-confident people.

7. As a result of Aruba enforcing its environmental protection framework and

policies, Aruba now boasts the most well-preserved beaches and waters,
cleanest public spaces and protected natural environment in the Caribbean
(both on land, air, and in the water).

8. Tapping into its growing environmental consciousness, Aruba is actively

exploring economically viable and more environmentally friendly ways of
producing usable energy.

9. Largely because of a favorable investment climate, a stable political

environment, and an educated multi-cultural workforce, Aruba has been able to
diversify its economy and thereby fortify its economic and social security.

10. Therefore by the year 2020, Aruba can be counted among the safest places in

the world to live, work, visit and invest.

3.6 In order to achieve this long-term national security vision, it is necessary to identify
overall long-term national security goals and objectives, and articulate desired program
results. The main strategies for ensuring national security are a balanced combination
of transparency, prevention (includes anticipation, preparedness), judicious

responsiveness (preparedness for crisis management), and an up-to-date and
enforced legal framework. These will be detailed in the following chapters.

### 4. WHAT DO WE FOCUS ON?

_“Let the fear of a danger be a spur to prevent it; he that fears not,_

_gives advantage to the danger.”_

─Francis Quarles, 1592-1644, British Poet

4.1 Prior to this planning exercise, several policy developments had already taken place

providing a continued foundation for the renewed focus on a broader definition of
national security. This chapter provides a brief background of recent policy
developments leading to this current planning effort and lays out an expanded focus for
the law and order sector based on a new vision for national security. This chapter
draws its information from 3 main sources: (1) relevant government reports and policy
documents; (2) analysis provided in the previous chapters; and (3) interviews with key
actors.

### Bilateral Agreements: Foundations of National Security 

4.2 The terrorist attack of 911 on the commercial center of New York has had deep and far

reaching effects on the world. As part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Aruba has
likewise become part of decisions to strengthen security measures and to join
international collaborative efforts to deal with the threat of international terrorism. In
the aftermath of 911, a first bilateral agreement was signed on Sept. 24, 2003 between
Aruba and the Netherlands to collaborate on improving the current Law and Order
Program. A few years later, two separate bilateral agreements were signed to expand
the initial work. These three bilateral agreements between Aruba and the Netherlands
form the foundation upon which to continue to strengthen our national security:

      - **Samenwerkings programma Rechtshandhaving (RHH)** **─ Aruba 2005-**
**2007. The goal is to strengthen the entire Aruban law and order process**
chain, in terms of both individual organizations as well as their working
relationships, including the coast guard organizations, in order to combat
transborder (grensoverschrijdende) organized crime and international
terrorism.

      - **Protocol van samenwerking ter verbetering van het functioneren van het**
**Korps Politie Aruba, Sept. 2006. The goal is to improve the operations of**
the Aruba Police Force in the overall interest of safeguarding the safety of the
citizens of Aruba. Specifically, it delineates a set of key activities and
collaborative arrangements to (a) improve the effectiveness and integrity of
the Aruba Police Force with which it combats all forms of criminality and
terrorism, and (b) its collaboration with other Government organizations in
Aruba, in the Dutch Kingdom, and outside.

      - **Memorandum of Understanding inzake de versterkte samenwerking van**
**Aruba en Nederland ter verbetering van het functioneren van de**
**vreemdelingenketen van Aruba, July 2007.  The goal is to strengthen and**
optimalize the collaboration among the Government departments that are part
of the immigration process chain. Specifically, this major goal is to be
achieved through improvement activities in all the relevant departments
through clarifying and sharpening all related tasks and capacities. A total of


-----

13 Government organizations engage in activities related to immigration
services.[9]

The two additional agreements with politically committed funding from the Netherlands
and Aruba Governments focus increased resources on two pivotal areas of security:
the Aruba National Police Force (KPA) and the Immigration Services

(Vreemdelingenketen).

### Long-term National Security Goals and Major Objectives

4.3 Long-term goals provide the overarching reason for our program activities and mark

the signposts of achievement along the way to reaching the vision. The long-term
goals are articulated in terms of the five dimensions of the Aruba national security
framework. Objectives provide the next level of specificity, breaking down the goal into
a level of detail that is practical and actionable. The more specific and realistic the
goals and objectives are, the better they lend themselves for translation into action
planning and implementation. It should be noted that a number of these objectives are
a continuation of the program approved within the first bilateral agreement of 20052007. The major objectives are identified for each goal within each dimension of
national security (see figure 2 for a tabulated overview).

4.4 **Territorial Security and Political Security. The long-term goal in terms of territorial**

security is to ensure continued protection of Aruba by Dutch Kingdom military
presence, bilateral and tri-partite agreements between Aruba, Netherlands and other
Kingdom partners, and by regional and international diplomacy against foreign
aggression as well as terrorism. The long-term goal in terms of political security is to
ensure that Government leadership and bureaucracy follow good governance practices
upholding the democratic rule of law.

**_Major Objective: Political Stability through Good Governance. This is partly_**
achieved by upholding the democratic rule of law (democratische rechtsorde) and
ensuring the organizational effectiveness of all institutions responsible for maintaining
public law and order, public health and security in Aruba (e.g., OM, KPA, VDA,
Immigration, Customs, MOT, KIA, KBA, Dir. Volksgezondheid, Rampen-bureau, etc.)
through:

    - Improvement of the information management system and exchange in the
various institutes in the law and order chain;

    - A more effective monitoring of persons, goods and transportation along the island
boundaries;

    - Quantitative and qualitative adjustments of the Meldpunt Ongebruikelijke
Transacties (MOT); and

    - Implementation and actualizing of required laws and regulations (these are
_priority areas of the 2005-2007 RHH approved program)._

4.5 **Social (Community and Personal) Security.** The long-term goal in terms of social

(community and personal) security is protect the citizens of Aruba (including the youth),

9
Government organizations involved in immigration are: 1) DIMAS (Departemento di Integracion, Maneho y Admision di
Stranhero), 2) IASA (Instituto di Alarma y Seguridad Aruba); 3) Examenbureau AUA; 4) Bureau BSB (Burgelijke Stand en
Bevolkingsregister); 5) DAO (Directie Arbeid en Onderzoek); 6) Ministerie van Vreemdelingenzaken; 7) Ministerie van Justitie;
8) OM (Openbaar Ministerie); 9) DEZHI (Directie Economische Zaken, Handel en Industrie); 10) Het kabinet van de
Gouverneur van Aruba; 11) KPA (Korps Politie Aruba); 12) VDA (Veiligheidsdienst Aruba); 13) DBB (Directie Buitenlandse
Betrekkingen).


-----

community groups _(different nationality groups), and visitors from physical violence_
whether from the nation of Aruba or external states, from violent individuals and substate actors, from domestic abuse, or from predatory individuals, young or old.

**_Major Objective: Human Capital Development through Investment in Youth._**
This is achieved by investing in the nation‘s youth and securing that through
prevention and effective responses, children and youth are protected and allowed to
develop to become educated, civil and law abiding citizens through:

    - Create a structure for national youth policy dialogue by building collaboration
among youth organizations, law and order, and government programs impacting
young people and involving youth directly in creating policy to reduce the risk of
youth involved in violence and crime.

    - Create a shared database for relevant stakeholders on research findings into the
relationship between the youth, drug usage and youth delinquency in Aruba (this
_is a modification of the priority area identified in the 2005-2007 RHH approved_
_program)._

4.6 **Economic Security. The long-term goal in terms of economic security is to protect the**

development of tourism through managed growth policies and develop alternative
sources of economic income to broaden our service economy to a knowledge
economy.

**Major** **Objective:** **Sustainable** **Economic** **Development** **and** **Diversified**

**Economy. This will be achieved** through government and private sector engaging in
a participatory process to create a vision of economic sustainability for Aruba and
creating collaboratively realistic possibilities for diversifying the economy for Aruba in
a way that considers in the balance environmental and social factors. A project
initiative is entering the implementation phase in January 2008 to initiate and
institutionalize an integral and strategic planning process involving the coordination
between relevant organizations (government, private sector, and civic).

4.7 **Environmental Security. The long-term goal in terms of environmental security is to**

ensure that environmental laws protect the people of Aruba from the short-and longterm damages of nature, man-made threats to the environment and deterioration of
nature. To closely examine the major industrial air polluting sources on the island in
terms of compliance with the 2005 Kyoto Protocol and other international
environmental protection agreements.

**Major Objective: Public Domain Safety. This is achieved by ensuring that the**
product of Aruba maintains its general tourist perception of safety and that a National
Crisis Management Action Plan exists to secure public safety in the event of
unexpected calamities. Planning and policy initiatives are already in progress
(Landverordening Ruimtelijke Ordening and the Ruimtelijk Ordenings Plan).

4.8 Whilst the vision provides a picture of the desired destination in the future, the goals

and objectives are the next step down representing signposts that tell us how close we
are getting to the vision. In order to achieve the goals and objectives, and get to the
vision, desired program results in each of the goal areas are the next level of specificity
in the overall plan. The next section identifies the desired program results, both those
identified in the first bilateral program and those newly identified in this planning
excercise.

### Desired Program Results: A Renewed Focus

4.9 The desired program results are determined by (1) the continued focus provided by the

bilateral agreements between the two governments of Aruba and the Netherlands
(2005-2007); (2) an expanded focus for the law and order sector based on a new vision
for national security (2008-2012) and (3) a broad understanding of the Aruban law and
order framework (Rechtshandhaving).[10] Although the vision is broadly focused and
wider net of stakeholders was involved in identifying areas requiring improvement in
national security, the focus of project activities in this plan will concern mostly the arena
related to law and order (RHH). All projects listed fall within the purview of RHH, i.e.,
(1) research and prevention; (2) inspection and control; and (3) criminal justice. (See
_Appendix 3 for the Aruba law and order framework)._

4.10 In terms of the desired program results, there are three major areas of activities that

will benefit from renewed focus and allocation of funding resources for the next 3-5
years. They are the areas of improvement in (1) good governance practices; (2) public
safety and quality of community life; and (3) national crisis management. (See Figure
_3 for a tabulated overview). Desired program results in the first area of improvement of_
good governance practices are:

1. More intensive collaboration between departments related to RHH and
Strengthening of institutional capacities; and
2. Legal reform to modernize and improve effective enforcement of RHH.

These 2 desired program results stem from the first bilateral agreement. Desired
program results in the second improvement area of public safety and quality of
community life include:

3.  Data based decision-making on alcohol and drug abuse prevention,

treatment, and alternatives to incarceration;

4.  National prevention campaign on drug abuse; and
5.  Resolution of the choller (homeless) phenomenon.
6.  Collaboration among youth organizations and across government

programs impacting young people by involving youth directly in creating
policy.

These newly formulated program results were identified during this current planning
exercise. Desired program results in the third improvement area of national crisis
management include:

7. Renewal of a national crisis prevention and management system.

This newly formulated program result was also identified during this current planning
exercise. Figure 2 provides a tabulated overview of the 3 major priority focus areas
and a total of 7 desired program results with their project focus activities.

10
The public law domain in the Aruban law and order framework covers three main responsibility: (1) Research, preventive
and pro-active focus; (2) Inspection & Control (Toezicht and Controle); and (3) Criminal Justice (Strafrecht en Repressie). See
Appendix 3 for a flow-chart description of the Aruba Rule of Law Framework.

### 5. HOW DO WE GET THERE?

_"Vision without action is a daydream. Action without vision is a nightmare."_

—Japanese proverb

6.6 This section presents project activities per program result. Several project activities

are a carry-over from the previous RHH 2005-2007 program and the 2 recently signed
bilateral agreements between Aruba and the Netherlands, and others emerge from the
expanded vision of national security. All departments and agencies related to RHH
were requested to complete a form submitting projects for improvement. A listing of
projects per program result area for the new funding cycle of 2008-2012 is provided in
Figure 3.

### Strategies and Projects

7.7 Based on past experiences, four key strategies are critical in raising the rate of project

implementation success:

 **Strengthening institutional capacity and good governance practices by all**

relevant agencies in the law and order chain, with a focus on project governance
structure that ensures that activities happen within an agreed upon time-frame
and the anticipated results and benefits are delivered. This is a pre-condition for
raising the rate of project implementation success.

 **Execution discipline, with a focus on** execution behaviors and techniques, and

the right resources and the right people. This is a pre-condition for ensuring that
dependable execution becomes part of the management‘s daily routine and that
people can hold themselves accountable and be held accountable by
management. Training for execution capacity should be a key part of institution
building.

 **Data-based decision-making, with a focus on data-gathering and analysis as**

input for public decision-making. Good and timely information provides a basis
for informed options upon which sound decisions can be made for the benefit of
the whole.

 **Participatory methods,** with a focus on involving a broad net of stakeholders,

including non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations in
decision-making and consensus-building.

These strategies need to guide how each project activity is to be achieved.

8.8 A listing of projects per program result area for the new funding cycle of 2008-2012 is

provided in Figure 3. There are 3 main priority focus areas identified for this new
funding cycle. Under the first priority focus area of Good Governance Practices, there
are 3 program result areas with a total of 11 separate projects per agency within the
RHH chain. Under the second priority focus area of Public Safety and Quality of
Community Life, there are another 4 program result areas with a total of 5 different
projects related to building the conditions capacities for raising safety in the community.
Under the third priority focus area of National Crisis Management, there is 1 program
result area with 3 related projects to raise the level of preparedness for unexpected
disasters on the island. This is a total of 19 projects for achieving Aruba‘s national
security vision 2020.

### Implementation Notes

_“Execution is the greatest unaddressed business issue in the world today. Its absence is the single_

_biggest obstacle to success and the cause of most of the disappointments that are mistakenly_

_attributed to other causes."_

─Larry Bossidy and Ram Charan in Execution - The Discipline of Getting Things Done

_"If you have an idea (vision), execute it; otherwise you’re a loser.”_

─Donald Trump, Office Building Real Estate Mogul

_“The best strategic plans in the world are not likely to be successful if they are not effectively_

_communicated to those who must implement them: the employees.”_

─Graziadio Business Report, 2003

5.5 The best implementation structures are highly participatory, intensely communicative,

and focused on executing specific measurable goals with clear deadlines. A structure
that allows for maximum participation of all actors from the top to the bottom gets
everyone in the system involved. Top down dissemination allows for the information to
spread. Not every single stakeholder can be included in the planning process, not
even a participatory one, but communications can go to everyone. Only when people
know where they are going, what the benefits are, what they have to do to get there,
and what support they are going to get to do so, does a plan stand a chance of being
successfully implemented. For every actor in the RHH system to be able to give their
support, they need to know and understand what the NSP (National Security Plan) is
about: what the vision is, the direction, the goals and the strategies.  Better
understanding will help build energy and commitment and allow for better decision
making that supports the national security vision.

5.6 Achieving the vision and goals also requires considerable management and

coordination as well as financial planning. It is therefore critical to institutionalize an
execution system and process, for instance, in the form of an NSP Implementation and
Monitoring Committee in charge of managing the NSP. To ensure that projects are
executed successfully, it is advisable that all directors (those ultimately responsible for
the success of the projects) and all those directly managing projects undergo a
capacity building training program on the discipline of project execution, budgeting and
long-term financial planning. Part of this execution system also requires training on
monitoring systems, such as a balanced scorecard to keep track of how project
objectives are being achieved and when course corrections are necessary. These prerequisite strategies will help ensure a high success rate for project implementation.

5.7 Further discussion with relevant parties is necessary to complete this chapter.

### 6.  HOW WILL WE KNOW WE GOT THERE?

6.1 Individual projects submitted in each of the program result areas are submitted

separately. Progress towards the national security vision will be ensured through
articulating desired outcomes[11] per program area and monitoring indicators of progress
along the way. Figure 5 on the following pages provide a list of desired outcomes and
indicators of programs per program result area. These were derived from relevant
government departments and other stakeholders in a meeting held January 18, 2008
and refined through feedback. It is intended to engage a project coordinator whose
main responsibility will be to manage, coordinate, provide support, liaise where
needed, and generally monitor the execution of all projects in this plan.

### Budget Notes

6.2 The budget for financing this plan is based on project submissions and cost projections

by the departments in the RHH chain. The projects were assessed and identified
according to their contribution to realizing the 3 priority focus areas in this National
Security Plan:

       - Good Governance practices

       - Public Safety and Quality of Community life

       - National Crisis Management

6.3 Eleven agency projects within the RHH chain are identified to fit within the purview of

good governance practices. Five different projects are recognized as fitting within the
arena of public safety and quality of community life. Three inter-related projects are
are identified as belonging in the arena of national crisis management with the purpose
of raising the level of preparedness for unexpected disasters on the island.

6.4 A total of 19 projects altogether are submitted in this budget (See Cost Estimate NSP

_2008-2012). More than one third (AWG 22 million) of the budget of this program is_
directed towards human capital development.  A major focus in the majority of the
projects identified in the RHH chain centers on intensifying the collaboration between
departments and on strengthening the institutional capacities of each department. The
process of capacity building will be jumpstarted with short-term training in project
execution and monitoring at the leadership and management levels (Project
_Implementation Preparation). This will be financed by a separate budget of the current_
multi annual plan 2006-2009.

6.5 Most of the project cost calculations, particularly for projects focused on achieving

public safety and quality of community life are still rough. Further dialogue will be
necessary with relevant stakeholders will be necessary to determine the exact scope
and cost of the projects.

11
An outcome is a benefit or a change for the target beneficiary during or after a program activity. An outcome is what
success would look like after the changes have been made. It usually is not achievable in the short run, but most often takes
multi-year efforts and may be the cumulative result over the years. Outcomes are usually expressed in what the situation will
look like or what individuals or groups will be able to do differently.

6.6 The interest proceeds (revenues) obtained trough FDA as a result of the investments

of the fund will be used in the first place to finance the additional costs of the
―Verbeterplan KPA‖ en that of the ―Vreemdelingenketen‖, as agreed between the two
countries.

6.7 The unforeseen amount will be used to finance the projectmanagement of the

FDA/AIB, as for the ―stage & uitzend‖ program, the program coordinator. The rest will
be available for the other projects. The ―stage & uitzend‖ program and the program
coordinator is calculated yearly at an amount of AWG 200.000,- . For project
preparation there is an amount of AWG 100.000,- available.

### APPENDICES

#### Appendix 1: Predictors of Youth Violence

**Individual Factors**
 Hyperactivity, concentration problems, restlessness, and risk taking: these behaviors in boys at age 10, 14,

_or 16 seem to correlate with later violence._

 Aggressiveness: aggressive behavior 6-13 seems to be a strong predictor of later violence among males.
 Early initiation of violent behavior: is associated with more serious and chronic violence in adult years.
 Involvement in other forms of anti-social behavior: including stealing, destruction of property, drug selling

_at ages 14 and 16 is associated with greater risk of violence among males._

 Beliefs and attitudes favorable to deviant or antisocial behavior: dishonesty, rule-breaking, cheating,

_hostility to police for example increases risk of violence among males._

**Family Factors**
 Parental criminality: men ages 14-23 with criminal fathers more at risk of violent criminal acts.
 Child maltreatment: children who have been physically abused or neglected more at risk of committing

_violent crime later in life._

 Poor family management practices: poor parental supervision and aggressive, harsh and punitive discipline

_at 14 predict later delinquency and substance abuse._

 Low levels of parental involvement: may increase children’s future risk for violence.
 Poor family bonding and family conflict: exposure to high levels of marital and family conflict may

_increase risk of later violence._

 Parental attitudes favorable to substance use and violence: parent abuse of alcohol predicts use of alcohol

_and drugs by youth._

 Parent-child separation: parent-child separation before age 10 found to predict violence.

**School Factors**
 Truancy and dropping out of school: high truancy rates of 12-14 are likely to predict violence later.
 Low bonding to school: low commitment to schooling, low educational aspirations at ages 14 and 16

_predicts risk for involvement in violence._

 Academic failure: poor academic achievement at 10, 14, and 16 predicts later delinquency.

**Peer-related Factors**
 Delinquent siblings: having delinquent siblings by age 10 is predictive of later convictions for violence.
 Delinquent peers: at the ages of 10, 14, 16 _have a greater influence on later violence during an individual’s_

_adolescence._

 Gang membership: at the age of 14 _and 16 contributes more to delinquency than does having delinquent_

_peers._

**Community and Neighborhood Factors**
 Poverty: contributes to a greater likelihood of involvement in crime and violence.
 Community disorganization: presence of crime, drug-selling, gangs, and poor housing is predictive of

_violence._

 Availability of drugs and firearms: predicts greater variety in violent behaviors at age 18.
 Neighborhood adults involved in crime: children age 14 and 16 who know many adult criminals are more

_likely to engage in violent behavior by age 18._


####  Exposure to violence and racial prejudice: increases a child’s risk for involvement in violent behavior later

_in life._
