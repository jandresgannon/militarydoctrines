# DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE (DOD)

 EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY’S

 OVERARCHING ANNUAL STRATEGIC STATEMENT (EA OASS)

 FOR 2012

## “Doing things differently to achieve more with less”

 Date of Tabling: 07 March 2012


-----

# FOREWORD: MINISTER OF DEFENCE AND MILITARY VETERANS, THE HONOURABLE MS L.N. SISULU: EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY’S OVERARCHING STRATEGIC STATEMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2012

The Fiscal Year 2012 has been framed by the strategic perspective adopted by
the Department of Defence in 2011, in response to the challenge issued by His
Excellency J.G. Zuma, President of the Republic of South Africa, during his State
of the Nation address of 11 February 2010. During this address the President
articulated the strategic focus of Government and its on going commitment to
build a strong developmental state, able to respond to the needs and aspirations
of the people of South Africa through an effective and responsive state. The
Departmental af� rmation for 2012 to “do things differently to achieve more with
less” will give further effect within the Department of Defence to achieve more with
less.

Accordingly, 2012 has been situated within the context of the continued
Government pursuit to build a performance-orientated state, through the
optimising of planning as well as performance monitoring and evaluation, and the
measurement for efforts in terms of outcomes, with an emphasis on accountability
and an action orientation.

Within the parameters of this contextual framework, and in pursuit of the Vision of effective defence for a democratic
_South Africa, a number of critical strategic priorities, outcomes, outputs and associated policy proposals for 2012_
have been de� ned.

Our priorities for the coming period, taking their lead from stated Government strategic intent, are to include, inter alia, a
focus on such pivotal elements as the execution of the border safeguarding function, the continued institutionalisation
of the new Service Dispensation for SANDF members, and the associated enactment of the requisite amendments
to pertinent Acts, the enhancement of the SANDF’s Landward Capabilities, the consolidation of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) Maritime Security Strategy, recently rati� ed within the structures of the SADC and
its subsidiary Organs, furthering the job creation agenda of Government, enhancement of the SANDF’s Peacekeeping
Formation, and the revitalisation of the Reserve Component. Other key agendas will include the continued restructuring
and support of the defence industry, and the formation of the Department of Defence Works Formation, which has
as its end-state an envisaged internal Departmental capacity for repair and maintenance, as well as a concomitant
furthering of the job creation agenda of Government.

The direction of focused, outcome based effort, towards the realisation of these priorities, will position the Department
in order to both optimally attain its key outcomes, viz enhanced civil control of the Department, and defence and
protection of the RSA, as well as to further the Government Programme of Action and the Government Medium Term
Strategic Framework.

In this regard, speci� c focus will be directed at Outcome 11: Creating a better South Africa and contributing to
_a better and safer Africa in the world. This outcome is fundamental to Defence process, and more speci� cally,_
to the attainment of the Mission, which provides, inter alia, that we “provide, manage, and employ defence
_capabilities commensurate with the needs of South Africa as regulated by the Constitution, national legislation_
_and Parliamentary and Executive Direction”._


-----

A further additional supporting focus will be directed at Outcomes 2: A long and healthy life for all South Africans,
3: All people in South Africa are, and feel safe, 5: A skilled and capable workforce to support an inclusive growth
_plan, and 12: An ef� cient, effective and development orientated public service and empowered, fair and inclusive_
_citizenship._

It is clear that our strategic framework within the coming period is underpinned by the intent to narrow the nexus
between the Government Vision of establishing a Developmental State and our Departmental Programme of Action
to support this Agenda, as well as to ensure the optimal achievement of our Defence outputs and outcomes in
accordance with our Constitutional Mandate.

However, it is to be noted that our capacity to attain this intent, will, to some degree, be constrained by a number of
factors within the performance delivery environment, most notable being the disconnect between the Constitutional
Mandate, the expectations of Government and the budget allocation, with all subsidiary risks which this entails. In
addition, the continued constraints within such support domains as our Defence research capability, infrastructure and
facilities, and information management, will demand careful and directed management in order to ensure adequate
mitigation.

In conclusion, the Department of Defence af� rms its deepest commitment to achieving the full spectrum of its
Constitutional Mandate, ensuring the successful attainment of its outputs, including the meeting of its ordered
commitments, mission ready defence capabilities, sound defence direction and defence compliance within the
regulatory framework. This will be framed by a value system which upholds as foremost such values as discipline,
transparency, fairness, excellence through leadership, honesty and integrity.

### MINISTER OF DEFENCE AND MILITARY VETERANS (MOD&MV) STRATEGIC PRIORITIES

For the period ahead, the Minister has pronounced herself in terms of the Departmental Strategic Priorities as aligned
with the Government Medium Term Strategic Framework (MTSF) Agenda that shall be pursued by the Department for
the FY2012/13 planning cycle. These Strategic Priorities will inform subsequent Departmental planning instruments,
strategic budgeting, monitoring and evaluation and risk management functions. The execution of these ministerial
priorities will enhance the effective realisation of the Defence mandate through a strategically focused Department
supported by and within available resource availability and allocation. The strengthened Departmental Monitoring and
Evaluation of performance in support of these Ministerial priorities will test the extent to which the Defence function
is and will be able to “do things differently and achieve more with less”. The Ministerial Strategic Priorities for the
FY2012 and beyond as con� rmed during the MOD&MV Strategic Worksession conducted during February 2012 are
as follows:

 - **Enhancement of the SANDF’s Landward Defence Capabilities. In order to undertake all required missions,**
the enhancement of the Landward Defence Capabilities is essential. For the Landward Defence Capability to
operate jointly with the Air Defence and Maritime Defence Capabilities, this enhancement is considered a priority.
The Landward Defence Capability has not enjoyed the advantage of being part of the Strategic Defence Packages
and is thus lacking technologically advanced Primary Mission Equipment. The funding of this priority will form part
of the FY2012/13 onwards strategic budgeting function of the DOD.

 - **Maritime Security. The defence and security of South Africa is inextricably linked to that of the region and the**
continent. Being a littoral country, South Africa requires a balanced maritime capability to effectively respond,
when so required, to arising maritime security threats affecting South Africa.

 - **Job Creation. In support of the Government’s new growth-path initiative aimed at job creation, the DOD will**
continue to ensure that job creation, within available resourcing, will be effected through approved projects within
the Defence industry.

 - **Enhancement of the SANDF’s Peacekeeping Capability (SANDF Deployability). The role of the SANDF**
in promoting peace and security in the region and on the African continent necessitates the enhancement of the
SANDF’s peacekeeping capability that will include the SANDF’s Forward Deployment Capability.

 - **National Youth Service (NYS). The Department will continue with the execution of the NYS programme through**
the utilisation of core Defence capabilities to provide initial training to selected youth prior to absorption into
respective Government Institutions.

 - **Revitalisation of the Reserves. As part of the one-force concept, the Reserves will continue to be transformed**
and revitalised to ful� ll the various Defence roles allocated to them in support of the regulars.

 - **Restructuring and Support of the Defence Industry. The restructuring of the Defence Industry will focus on**
required Defence capabilities and the sustainability thereof. The Defence Industry Framework and Function are
to be fully aligned in order to ensure synchronisation of these with the requirements and mandate of Defence.
The emphasis of the restructuring will be focused on the Governance, Risk Management, Compliance and
Accountability framework function applicable to the Defence Portfolio.

 - **Department of Defence Works Capability. The current state of the Defence Facilities Portfolio has called for**
the review of the existing arrangements for the repair and maintenance programme of Defence facilities. The
establishment of the DOD Works Capability within the Support (Logistics) Programme seeks to achieve an end
state where the DOD will have a fully functional and resourced in-house capability that will ultimately assume full
responsibility for the Defence facilities repair and maintenance programmes.


-----

### MOD&MV STRATEGIC FOCUS AREA

During the course of 2012 and beyond, the DOD shall adopt a zero-tolerance attitude to all forms of corruption
and fraud within the department. The infrastructure to combat fraud and corruption is to be fully capacitated and
shall include the capacitation of the Military Justice System, Military Police and the Inspector General. The � ght
against fraud and corruption must address ICT-based risk areas which must be responded to through skilled DOD
IT functionaries.

In order for Defence to remain at the forefront of innovation and best practice pertaining to fraud and corruption
practices and trends, benchmarking with other State organs are to be undertaken by Defence.

The management of DOD assets is the responsibility of commanders and managers within the DOD, and to ensure
accountability, this aspect shall be included in the Commanders’ and Managers’ Performance Agreements.

### DEFENCE IN RELATION TO OUTCOMES-BASED PLANNING

During the course of FY2012/13, Defence will continue the already advanced implementation of the outcomesbased strategic planning principles as legislated through the National Treasury (NT) Framework on Strategic and
Annual Performance Plans, 2010. The Framework compels Departments to ensure Constitutionally and legislatively
developed Departmental outcomes-based perspectives which shall include the following: Outcomes, Outputs,
Activities, Inputs and the additional DOD perspective “Building for the Future”. Each of the Departmental perspectives,
as presented in the DOD Strategy Map (Figure 2 below), is supported by well-de� ned and developed auditable and
veri� able performance indicators and targets, as a means of measuring progress towards the achievement of the
Departmental strategic priorities and planning instruments. The publication of “Technical Indicator Descriptions” for
each performance indicator will be published on the DOD’s website as prescribed by the NT Framework.

### DOD STRATEGY MAP

The DOD Strategy Map is a visual presentation of the DOD’s high-level strategic focus as informed by the Constitutional
and legislative mandate pertaining to Defence. The DOD Strategy Map re� ects various “horizontal” perspectives
which intersect with multiple vertical “outputs” depicting at the point of vertical and horizontal intersection, the
Departmental demand for service delivery and execution. Each of these vertical and horizontal intersecting “bubbles”
are individually supported by approved Departmental “core” performance indicators and targets that will inform the
level of performance that is required at that speci� c intersection point. The set of performance indicators which support
the DOD Strategy Map intersection points are outlined in Appendix A to this Strategic Statement. The DOD Strategy
Map will form the basis for the development of subordinate Departmental strategy maps, performance information
development, strategic and annual planning instruments, strategic budgeting, monitoring and evaluation and risk
management processes. The top-down alignment of Departmental strategic planning processes and bottom-up
reporting against these processes will ensure a strategically focused Department and will ensure unity of effort and
resource allocation in support of the Defence mandate.

### DOD CONTRIBUTION AND ALIGNMENT WITH THE MEDIUM TERM STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK (MTSF) PRIORITIES AND OUTCOMES OF GOVERNMENT

The 2009 electoral mandate of the current administration has identi� ed the following � ve strategic priorities as the
cornerstone of the current national imperatives:

 - Halve poverty and unemployment by 2014.

 - Ensure a more equitable distribution of the bene� ts of economic growth and reduce inequality.

 - Improve the national health pro� le and skills base and ensure universal access to basic services.

In support of the above-mentioned � ve electoral mandate priorities of the current administration, the following ten
supporting strategic priorities have been identi� ed as key drivers to the successful achievement of each of the � ve
electoral mandate priorities. The table below provides a high-level synopsis of the alignment and support of Defence
to each of the ten priorities of the developmental agenda of Government. The ten Government strategic priority
outputs which will give effect to the above � ve electoral mandate priorities are listed in Table 2, aligned with the
priorities of the DOD.

# PART 3: DOD PERFORMANCE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT

The DOD is in the process of developing the DOD Integrated Strategic Management Enabler (ISME) which will enable
the integration and full alignment of the DOD planning, budgeting, reporting and risk management functions thereby
ensuring a strategically focused DOD. The DOD ISME will enable the alignment between departmental outputs,
budgets and risks supported and enabled by a sound reporting system to ensure performance reporting/evaluation
and identi� cation of deviation to plan. The development of the DOD ISME during the MTEF period and beyond will
see the phased-in implementation of key focused strategic elements of the planning, budgeting, reporting and risk
management process with an initial primary focus on DOD performance information management, and reporting.
The DOD ISME will at it’s core, ensure the enhancement of Departmental information systems which will enable the
effective and ef� cient utilisation of state resources in support of the Defence mandate and support to Government
MTSF priorities.

The continuing enhancement of the DOD Performance Information Management (PIM) function, amongst others,
through the development of the DOD ISME, will ensure the accuracy and auditability of Departmental performance
information as a basis for the development of the Defence Chapter of the annual Estimate of National Expenditure
(ENE), and subsequent subordinate planning, budgeting, reporting and risk management functions within the DOD.

Table 4 below provides the current high-level performance indicators, aligned with the DOD Strategy Map and will form
the basis for the development of subordinate departmental planning instruments and also the basis of departmental
reporting.
