###### Introduction

This Strategy Statement encompasses the civil and military elements of the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, and sets out a shared High Level Goal:

###### To provide for the military defence of the State, contribute to national and international peace and security and fulfil all other roles assigned by Government.

This High Level Goal comprises three broad Strategic Dimensions: Defence Policy; Ensuring the Capacity to Deliver; and Defence Forces Operational
Outputs. Under each Strategic Dimension, a number of Strategic Goals are identified and flowing from these are the identified priority Objectives and Actions which will
be pursued over the period 2017 to 2020.

In the development of this Strategy Statement, a meeting was held with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence while the

Defence Forces Representative Associations and staff throughout the Defence Organisation [1 ]were also consulted .

###### Mandate

The Constitution of Ireland vests the right to raise and maintain military or armed forces exclusively in the Oireachtas and expressly prohibits the raising and
maintenance of any other military or armed force for any purpose whatsoever. It vests supreme command of the Defence Forces in the President and also
provides that the exercise of such command shall be regulated by law. The governing legislation is contained in the Defence Acts 1954-2015, which provide that
military command of, and all executive and administrative powers in relation to, the Defence Forces, including the power to delegate command and authority, shall
be exercisable by the Government and through and by the Minister for Defence. By law, the Minister for Defence is also the head of the Department of Defence
while the Secretary General is the "principal officer" of the Department and is also appointed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform as the Accounting
Officer for all defence expenditure. Defence Forces Headquarters (DFHQ) is the military element of the Department of Defence, which is headed by the Chief of Staff,
who is the Minister's principal military adviser.

In accordance with the Defence (Delegation of Ministerial Functions) Order 2017, the Government has delegated specified powers and duties of the Minister for
Defence to the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Paul Kehoe TD.

###### White Paper on Defence [2 ]

The White Paper on Defence, approved by Government in July 2015, provides the defence policy framework out to 2025. This policy framework, which provides
that Ireland will continue to maintain its policy of military neutrality, is flexible and responsive given the dynamic nature of the security environment and enables the
Defence Organisation to be adaptive to changing circumstances. As well as providing for the defence of the State from armed aggression, the roles assigned include
continued provision of supports to An Garda Siochana, the defence contribution to international peace and security and the defence

contribution to major emergencies and civil contingencies. A key feature of the White Paper is the gee-political and domestic security environment assessment[3 ]
which provided the basis for the defence policy response and other policy requirements that are set out and which, in turn, led to the consolidation of those
requirements into revised roles for both the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force (RDF).

The White Paper also sets out key principles on capability development, the future development of both the RDF and Civil Defence, and places a strong
emphasis on development of the human resources of the Organisation. White Paper implementation is also addressed and, since publication, a total of 88
separate projects were identified to be completed over a ten year period, with a joint civil military White Paper Implementation Facilitation Team established to support
and monitor the progress of these White Paper projects.

###### Programme for a Partnership Government 2016
In relation to Defence, the Programme for a Partnership Government agreed in May 2016 identified a total of 14 separate commitments, many of which overlap with
extant White Paper projects and are reflected across the various Objectives and Actions that are identified in this Strategy Statement. Details of the 14 specific
commitments contained in the Programme that have been assigned to Defence are contained in the Appendix, along with details of other commitments made in respect
of which Defence has a contributory role.

###### Defence Funding
Defence funding is providea on an annual basis through two separate allocations: Vote 35 (Army Pensions) and Vote 36 (Defence).

The Army Pensions Vote provides for the payment of pension benefits to retired military personnel and certain dependants. As such, the Vote is non-
discretionary and demand driven. Superannuation benefits - retirement pensions and once-off lump sums - account for over 95% of all military pensions
expenditure. The balance is spent on military disability pensions and other ancillary benefits. The gross Vote 35 allocation for 2017 amounted to €229m while the
Budget allocation for 2018 is €239m.

The Defence Vote provides for both capital and current expenditure and in 2017 the gross allocation amounted to a total of €692m with a Budget allocation of
€707m provided for 2018. The White Paper on Defence 2015 provides the policy approach to investment, whilst the 2018-2021 Capital Spending Plan includes a
Defence provision of €416m. The capital element of Vote 36 is used for the purchase and upgrade of military equipment, necessary building and maintenance

works, and ICT projects.

###### Cross Cutting with other Departments and Agencies
There are important cross-departmental dimensions to the work of the Defence Organisation and meeting our Goals and Objectives is often critically
dependent on the inputs and co-operation of other Departments and State Agencies. Equally, their success can be dependent on the inputs and co-operation of the
Defence Organisation. Department officials and Defence Forces personnel are represented on a number of inter-departmental groups and committees which
consider a range of cross-cutting issues that impact on Government. Some of these cross-cutting relationships are outlined below.

###### nahEireann
**D&ENCE FORCES IRELAND**

The White Paper reflects the importance of whole of Government approaches to the security of the State. In this context, the Department of Defence will
continue to collaborate with a range of Departments and Agencies who have security responsibilities. Such engagement includes that under the auspices of Cabinet
Committee F (National Security), the National Security Committee and the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning. Increased collaboration in terms of
planning, capability awareness, and joint exercising contributes to a stronger and more comprehensive approach to mitigating security threats to the State.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is a key strategic partner with which the Defence Organisation will continue to have a close and effective working
relationship in the areas of UN Peacekeeping; International Security Policy; Disarmament, Non-Proliferation and Arms Control; and Sustainable Development. The
Defence Organisation will continue to contribute to the implementation of the relevant Sustainable Development Goals and targets, as set out in the 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Defence Organisation will also continue to contribute to the inter-departmental groups focused on the
implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 through Ireland's second National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security.

The Defence Organisation has pioneered the use of MOUs and SLAs covering services delivered to a range of Government Departments and Agencies. These
are defined and may include specific output targets for the Defence Forces. The Department will continue to develop this framework where appropriate.

The Office of Emergency Planning will continue to support the Minister for Defence in his role as Chairman of the Government Task Force on Emergency
Planning and, where appropriate, will continue to provide assistance during national emergencies/crises to the lead Government Departments and participate in inter-
agency structured exercises.

Whilst the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has the lead role in relation to cyber security, the Defence Organisation is
committed to participating in the delivery of measures to improve the cyber security of the State, as proposed in the Cyber Security Strategy for Ireland which was
approved by Government in 2015.

In terms of procurement, the Defence Organisation continues to pursue the potential for enhanced future cooperation in joint procurement activities by the Defence
Category Council, which operates under the auspices of the Office of Government Procurement, and which is chaired by the Department of Defence and also includes
representation by personnel with responsibility for procurement from An Garda Siochana and the Irish Prison Service.

The Department of Defence will continue to work with the Office of the Attorney General to ensure that work is completed within a sound legal and constitutional
framework. The Defence Organisation will further develop its positive relationship with the Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces.

The Defence Organisation has a key role to play in the Decade of Centenaries Programme and will continue to work closely with the Department of Culture, Heritage and
the Gaeltacht towards ensuring a successful commemorative programme, including input to state ceremonies and management of the Military Service (1916-1923)
Pensions Collection project.

The Department of Defence will continue to support the engagement by Civil Defence with local authorities, and the continued provision of Civil Defence support,
under the Framework for Major Emergency Management across a range of emergency incidents.

###### Partnership, Conciliation and Arbitration, and Veterans Policy

The Defence Organisation will continue to invest time and resources in partnership structures. Benefits include a greater shared understanding of the business of
defence and how that can be progressed, better internal and external communications, the development of customer service planning and implementation, better
environmental planning, and the creation of forums in which issues of concern can be resolved.

The Defence Forces Conciliation and Arbitration (C&A) Scheme, which will be subject to a review, provides a range of fora for defence management to discuss
with the Defence Forces Representative Associations (RACO and PDFORRA), within the scope of representation, the impact of the implementation of this Strategy
Statement. Although they do not come under the formal C&A Scheme, provision has been made for representation for members of the Reserve, by RDFRA.
The Department also interacts with the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation which represents members of the Army Nursing Service.

The White Paper on Defence recognises the valued public service given by former servicemen and women of the Defence Forces. To this end, a range of initiatives
have been identified for implementation to enhance supports available to veterans.

###### Human Rights and Equality Issues
Having regard to section 42(2) of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014, the human rights and equality issues that are relevant to the
performance of the functions of the Department of Defence have been considered in the preparation of this Strategy Statement.

Whilst the Defence Forces are not a public body for the purposes of the Act, the Department of Defence has a key role in the formulation of policy in relation to the
Defence Forces, and in monitoring its implementation. The White Paper continues the development of this agenda. The approach to human rights and equality
issues is being pursued through a number of initiatives. These include the development of a Diversity and Inclusion Strategy for the Defence Forces, an Equality
Policy, and a number of new initiatives recently implemented with a view to increasing female participation in the Defence Forces.

Various measures are also in place to ensure the right of each individual, civil or military, to dignity in their work environment and in all activities arising from their
service, whilst provisions also exist for dealing with internal complaints and the disclosure of information under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.
