###### Foreword by the Minister of Defence

I am delighted to introduce the _White Paper on Defence, which was written in_
accord with the formal statement of policy by the government of Prime Minister
Petr Nečas. After being appointed Minister of Defence, I made two key promises:
a commitment to realism and openness. The _White Paper on Defence describes_
the contemporary state in which the Czech Armed Forces currently fi nd themselves,
without any adornments. It is not exactly pleasant reading, but without being honest
we cannot fi nd the solutions. I refuse to speak with fi nancially driven intentions, nor
do I have any expectation of an increase in the MoD budget, which would match the
cuts carried out in recent years. Nonetheless, I remain optimistic the budget will rise
gradually.

We have reached an important juncture at the Ministry of Defence. After years of
budget reductions, empty interventions and squandered political capital, analyses of
the Ministry show that our reserves have been exhausted. Solutions to our problems
we presently face are complex, but answers do exist. They call for systematic changes
of the systems and the redirection of resources to the missions that the Czech Armed
Forces aim to achieve. Understandably, the White Paper on Defence proposes many
unpopular, yet necessary changes, and we anticipate some people will question the
termination of some non-essential military capabilities.

However, the Ministry of Defence will not sit idle during tough times; such a position
would equate to abandoning our national defence, a hazard no responsible and
accountable politician would dare accept. Therefore, it is necessary to initiate structural
changes and gradual increases to the defence budget. As a result, these solutions
will better enable the Czech Armed Forces to fulfi l their designated political-military
obligations. I recognise a complex problem requires a complex solution that reaches
beyond the horizon of one government and the capabilities of one minister. Hence, the
future of our armed forces must be an important issue for all democratic parties and
governments.


-----

The White Paper on Defence offers a method for coping not only with budget reductions,
but also with the challenges resulting from the changing security environment of the
last decade. It presents specifi c descriptions and recommendations on the manner
in which the Ministry of Defence, together with its subordinate organizations, should
work. This document has been developed in cooperation with civilian and military
experts from the Ministry of Defence, the Czech Armed Forces and public sector. The
commission designated for the development of the White Paper on Defence has held
thirteen meetings since last September. Divided into individual working groups, over
one hundred people conducted research and fi eldwork to develop the White Paper on
_Defence. The development of the White Paper occurred with great sincerity and effort_
by the contributing soldiers and civilians. The consensus reached by both parties will
undoubtedly strengthen our institutional capacity, and at the same time, underscore
the notion that national defence goes beyond the responsibility of soldiers.

Because the world is constantly in motion, neither document nor proposed change
can be regarded as fi nal and constant; the White Paper on Defence is no exception
to this sentiment. In light of this, it should be noted that the scope of this document
is tailored to address the immediate and short-term issues at hand. However, the
White Paper does offer particular recommendations on tackling painful realities that
currently burden our defence sector. The document is not intended to be an eternal
masterpiece, it should be reviewed no later than fi ve years from now. Security of the
Czech Republic should be a responsibility of all the citizens of the Czech Republic,
and the White Paper on Defence is a step towards making this idea a reality.

Alexandr Vondra,
Minister of Defence

###### Foreword by the Chief of General Staff

“The subordination of the political point of view to the military would be contrary to
common sense, for policy has declared the war; it is the intelligent faculty, war only
the instrument, and not the reverse. The subordination of the military point of view to
the political is, therefore, the only thing which is possible.“ These words written by Carl
von Clausewitz express the principle upon which modern armed forces are built-up.
However, there are two aspects to be taken into consideration. The fi rst rests on the
right to make decisions about armed forces as a tool for safeguarding national security
and control over the armed forces themselves. The second aspect is the responsibility
for their development, since without armed forces no security can ever be guaranteed.

In 1989, Czechoslovakia not only passed through fundamental political transformations,
but it also “lost” its foe. For this reason, the attitude toward building and utilising armed
forces changed simultaneously. Massive armed forces were deemed unnecessary,
subsequent downsizing and eventual professionalization were seen as the most logical
next step. Since 1999, we have been an integral part of the North Atlantic Alliance.
As a medium sized country, the Czech Republic cannot be a mere consumer of security;
on the contrary, we obligated to contribute to its sustainment. We do not share the
opinion that, thanks to our NATO membership, the Czech Republic does not need to
develop its armed forces’ capabilities. Just the opposite is the case, and we believe the
chain is only as strong as its weakest link.

In 2002, we reformed our armed forces with the intent of preventing the Czech Republic
from being the metaphorical weakest link in NATO. We have not yet become the
weakest link, but such a possibility still exists. Despite this, and in cooperation with
our allies, the Czech Republic deploys forces and equipment, for which we have
received positive assessment and we have proven that we can help at home as well.


-----

However, we must frankly admit that the transformation has not been entirely successful.
The main reason can be seen in the diminishing fi nancial framework and postponement
of individual modernisation projects in the Czech Armed Forces.

Building our national defence is a long-lasting and continuous process. Soldiers
frequently say that our mission is to listen and carry out orders, but we should not be so
passive. The truth is, although we do not decide on setting missions for the armed forces
and how they should be deployed, we have to be more active in proposing the best ways
to organize the military aspects of defending the Czech Republic and its allies.

Two and a half millennia ago, Master Sun Tzu, a renowned military theoretician wrote:
“With careful and detailed planning, one can win; with careless and less detailed planning,
one cannot win. How much more certain is defeat if one does not plan at all!” The White
Paper on Defence, which was made possible thanks to highly intensive cooperation
between soldiers and civilian experts, can be, to some extent, understood as such
a well-prepared plan. I am pleased this document has been produced, especially due
to the dire circumstances the Czech Armed Forces currently face. The decisions being
made are not only about the strength, equipment and capability of the armed forces. It is
a struggle for the survival of the armed forces as a functional organism. Putting the
_White Paper on Defence into practice will not be an easy process. Therefore, I would_
like to urge all soldiers to accept and uphold its conclusions and recommendations,
even though they may sometimes be painful.

###### Key Findings and Recommendations

The requirement for the production of the White Paper on Defence[1] is the result of many
factors, the most signifi cant of which are the following: the dynamically changing security
environment; lessons learned from international operations; the new NATO Strategic
Concept; updated Security Strategy of the Czech Republic; impacts of the economic
crisis on Czech public budgets; and the summary analysis of the MoD resources and
the state of the Czech Armed Forces.

The aim of the White Paper lies in the analysis of the overall state of the Ministry of
Defence, the Czech Republic’s Armed Forces and the designation of conceptual
principles and specifi c goals for their stable development. The emphasis is put primarily
on overcome the period of immediate impacts of the budget crisis (short-term horizon)
and subsequent in-depth evaluation of stabilizing and sustaining MoD operability
(medium up to long-term horizon) for the sake of preserving the armed forces combat
readiness, ensuring national defence and meeting the Czech Republic’s international
commitments. In order to achieve these goals, it is necessary to update or state more
precisely the functions, aims and missions that the Czech Ministry of Defence will
achieve and accomplish in the next decade despite the current economic conditions.

The main document is divided into eleven chapters, the fi rst two are contextual. The fi rst
chapter summarizes legislatively stipulated or politically defi ned points of departure and
determinants, as well as commitments and ambitions that must be, in the process of
building the Czech Republic defence policy and development of its tools, fully respected.
The following chapter describes the strategic environment and its infl uence on the
national security of the Czech Republic and its allies, identifi es implicit threats and risks,
and formulates the Czech Republic’s security interests.

On this basis, the White Paper subsequently defi nes the roles and functions of the Czech
Armed Forces and character of their capabilities, and simultaneously identifi es individual
sources (i.e. human, fi nancial and material) that are indispensable for building an
adequate structure of the armed forces. Attaining the desired quality of the armed forces
and thus meeting the requirements for its preservation, development and potential use is
the key mission in which principally all activities running in the MoD Sector, as described
in the following chapters, should be directed. With this goal in mind, the authors have
formulated proposals for organisational changes, as stated in the penultimate chapter.

The White Paper can also be seen as an assignment or plan for complex project
management to optimize the MoD Sector. It defi nes the desired target state in its
individual parts. Therefore, the text is written in present tense, even in those cases

1 Hereinafter referred to as the White Paper.


-----

when the current reality shows an apparent divergence. The fi nal chapter of the White
_Paper contains the time schedule for implementing specifi c measures to achieve the_
goals and accomplish the missions included therein.

###### Key Findings

Since 2007, when the document _Transformation of the Czech Ministry of Defence_
_Sector, which is still in effect, defi ned the political-military ambitions and ideals of the_
Czech Armed Forces capabilities, the national budget has been dramatically cut down.
From a comparison of these ambitions (seen as the target state for the future), a detailed
analysis of currently available resources and of the outlook for the next ten years in all
three resource areas (i.e. human, fi nancial, and material), the following results emerge:

� The Czech population is ageing and the MoD’s competitive capabilities in
the labour market are weakening. Thus, as a consequence of these trends,
the armed forces will encounter more diffi culties in recruiting new candidates
for military service, and the currently valid quantitative ambitions of 26,200
personnel will become unattainable.

� As a consequence of ad hoc budget cuts resulting in postponed investments,
non-systemic investments and overpriced contracts, the defence sector has
accumulated internal debt in armament, equipment, materials and unmovable
infrastructure. As a result, the estimated amount of internal debt accrued over
the last decade is roughly 80 to 90 billion CZK.

� The demand for huge investments into the renewal and modernisation of
technical aspects of many crucial military capabilities will be concentrated within
two relatively short periods around the years 2015 and 2020. With regards to the
investments planned around 2015, which amount to several tens of billions of
crowns, they cannot be staggered over time due to the current budget limitations
and its future prognosis. This period is burdened with the leasing deadline for
JAS-39 Gripen supersonics and the end of the service life of both the 2K12
KUB surface-to-air missiles and the air defence radar equipment. Furthermore,
the artillery will need modernisation and the service life of a part of the BMP–2
fi ghting vehicles will expire. The Mi-24/35 attack helicopters will face a similar
problem in the following decade.

The situation we are now in is critical, but it is not at an impasse. The White Paper
proposes a number of steps towards consolidating the MoD Sector. First of all, it is
possible by way of internal regulations to generate immediate (hundreds of million
crowns) or long-term savings (several billion crowns). However, the defi cit, consisting
of the debt that has been accumulated in the past, together with the anticipated
investments in the future, is much higher. Achieving the political-military ambitions, the
expression of which shall be the attainment of full operational capabilities until 2018, as
included in the plans, appears unrealistic. Under similar threat is the capacity to meet


-----

the Czech Republic’s international commitments and executing missions in the Czech
Republic territory in the event of non-military emergencies. Thus, in a long-term outlook,
it is indispensable to redirect resources that are available to the Ministry of Defence and
allocate them primarily to supporting the key functions and roles of the armed forces,
especially those that are mandatory and result from Czech legislation and international
obligations.

###### General Recommendations

A number of general conclusions have been attained from analyses performed during
the process of elaborating the White Paper. To begin, the following courses of action are
unacceptable:

� tolerate the absence of effi cient tools for the management of the Ministry of
Defence;

� tolerate mismanagement in the defence sector;

� continue with across the board downsizing of the armed forces, although their basic
structure still shows features of a much larger army from the beginning of 1990s;

� maintain an oversized bureaucracy and other ineffi cient components to the
detriment of the productive parts of the Ministry of Defence, including the armed
forces command and control system, and

� subsidize activities, infrastructure and other material assets that are not directly
related to the primary missions of the defence sector.

Therefore, for the sake of consolidating the defence sector, it is absolutely necessary to:

� apply a programmatic approach in the planning and strategic management of
the Ministry of Defence;

� generate internal savings through optimized processes and the C2 organisational
structures within the entire MoD Sector;

� clear the Ministry of Defence of duplicated and other activities that are not
directly related to its core functions and do not support the development of
military capabilities;

� strictly prioritise investments into the development of military capabilities
according to their contribution to roles, functions and international commitments
of the Czech Armed Forces; stop investing into non-essential capabilities, and
terminate or cease to restore their operation;

� introduce a transparent and effective acquisition process;

� increase the defence spending on the basis of specifi c and justifi ed investment
requirements and projects.


-----

###### Specifi c Measures

In the fi eld of defence planning:

Introduce a thoroughly uniform and obligatory set of goals intended to integrate and
coordinate defence planning with other planning and follow-on processes, inclusive of
budgeting, yet aimed at interconnecting target-based and fi nancial aspects of planning.
The development of a temporary plan for the year of 2012 and middle-term plan for the
period 2013 through 2017 will incorporate the abovementioned goals.

Unambiguously allocate responsibilities for attaining the goals at all levels of MoD
management and the Armed forces command and control. Provide responsible
personnel – target managers with the tools and authorities they need to accomplish
their missions.

Apply prioritising of requirements depending on the availability of sources and risk
assessment in terms of postponing or cancelling a requirement.

Establish the Minister of Defence Planning Board, as an advisory body for discussing
strategic points in defence planning and integrating civil and military aspects of the
planning process.

In the fi eld of management:

Introduce Performance-Oriented Budgeting that enables monitoring of cost ratio and
performance, and comparing them with the objectives of defence policy. Interconnect the
command and control system with the system of economic management more closely
and make public control over using public resources transparent.

Develop an information support system for economic management which is compatible
with that being built by the Ministry of Finance.

Implement controlling.

Strive to stabilize defence expenditures and maintain a long-term planning predictability
through the development of a sliding-scale budget outlook in the mode 1+4 years
(current fi scal year with a four-year outlook).

In the fi eld of personnel management:

In the interest of stopping or at least slowing down the process of ageing of the armed
forces, as well as raising the attractiveness of the military profession and competitive
strength in the labour market, introduce a new career code which must be based on
enforceable rules for a centrally controlled, transparent, competitive and selective
professional career, and apply objective criteria for evaluating soldiers’ performance.


-----

Improve interconnectedness of a career path with the personnel system of individual
development. Change the content of educational and training programmes. Emphasize
the development of practical military skills and command ability of graduates from military
schools and career courses.

Enhance the attractiveness of the military profession. Important factors in this area include:
levels of compensation, service pension, compensation for service in locations as required
by the armed forces, support to families of soldiers deployed on foreign operations and
missions, refurbishing the infrastructure in military garrisons, improving working conditions,
medical care of military veterans and pensioners, comprehensive psychological service
and military chaplaincy.

Rationalize structures and functions of current training and educational activities and
institutes. Maximize educational capacities and programmes both at home and abroad.

In the fi eld of military capabilities:

Retain the tactical Air Force, equipped with both supersonic and subsonic airplanes, for
defending the Czech Republic airspace, supporting the land forces and taking part in
joint operations. Discontinue the development of the anti-aircraft missile defence based
on the 2K12 KUB system. This measure corresponds with the NATO recommendation
and framework in which a new territorial anti-missile defence system is being built. The
Short Range Air Defence (SHORAD) capability designed to protect deployed units will be
preserved and developed.

Withdraw from active service the Mi–24/35 attack helicopters whose level of ballistic
protection is low, avionics are obsolete, and which are not interoperable by NATO
standards. No more investments shall be placed in this capability. As soon as possible,
sell off the newer Mi–35 attack helicopters and focus attention on the capabilities of the
transport helicopter force that can be used not only in the framework of NATO collective
defence but also for the integrated rescue system.

Stop investments in the further development of mobile passive surveillance systems.
Concentrate on a renewal and development of the systems of stationary and mobile
radars that are directly linked to the NATO Integrated Air Defence System (NATINADS).

Shut down at least one of the four tactical airbases. In its regular evaluation, NATO
recommends concentrating the Air Force on two tactical airbases.

Gradually decommission the tracked infantry fi ghting vehicles (BMPs). Regarding their
technical parameters, retain the BMP–2 in active service till the end of their life span
(2018–2020). The decision on either modernisation or replacement of the BMP–1 shall be
made no later than the end of 2013.


-----

Preserve the capability of the tank battalion till the end of its life span, and meanwhile
consider the usefulness of its further development. Sell off the stored inactive tanks as
soon as possible.

Reassess mobilisation needs, primarily retain and develop the Host Nation Support (HNS),
i.e. capacities for the operational preparation of the territory to receive allied support; and
dispose of all redundant material as soon as possible.

By mid–2012, fi nd ways of using the Biological Protection Centre in Těchonín (sharing its
capacities with other ministries or organisations involved in the Czech security system or
in the framework of international cooperation), or shut it down.

Manage the development of other priorities pursuant to the following preferences:

� ensure the effective support and conditions for the reception of the allied
forces on the territory of the Czech Republic (HNS) and guarantee cybernetic
protection;
� increase the interoperability, deployability and sustainability of the forces
according to NATO standards;
� a commitment to material and equipment that will most likely be deployed
in operations within the next fi ve years and achieve a high added value, for
example by means of specialisation in CBRN defence;
� fulfi l the minimum military requirements for protecting the Czech airspace, and
� preserve capacities for supporting the integrated rescue system (IRS).

Develop particular projects and capabilities in:

� fulfi lling tasks within NATO’s Network Enabled Capability (NEC), i.e. the
Alliance’s integrated information environment;
� building integrated systems for military intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance,
target tracking and destroying;
� completing the 21[st] Century Warfi ghter project;
� increasing the protection of deployed forces by strengthening the capacities
of unexploded ordnance disposal and improvised explosive device (IED)
protection.

Invest in research, development and innovations. Prefer projects that directly support
the required capabilities of the Armed forces. Achieve a maximum applicability of results.
Concentrate efforts in perspective areas such as unmanned and robotic devices,
cybernetic systems and applications focused on cybernetic security, or CBRN research
and development. Support cooperation in the fi eld of military defence and civil security
research.

Search for ways of sharing, interconnecting or in the joint development of military capabilities
with NATO/EU allies.


-----

In the fi eld of procurement and asset management:

Introduce an acquisition system based on transparent, direct, and target-oriented
planning.

Specify sharing of responsibilities so that particular persons are accountable for
individual steps or phases of an acquisition process. Strictly separate the roles of users
(managers of specifi c targets), asset managers (personnel responsible for a group of
assets), economists and purchasers.

Give preference to direct purchases of off-the-shelf products in an open call for tenders.
Carry out market research directly with manufacturers, without mediators. Always take
into consideration the entire life-span costs of the product. Keep the process under
independent, technical and legal monitoring.

Establish the National Offi ce for Armament, as a centre for purchases and project
management of armament acquisitions.

In a maximum scope, use the services of the NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency
(NAMSA).

Reduce property in the ownership of the Ministry of Defence through reassessing
locations of military units and facilities, and review the housing and accommodation
policy with respect to the armed forces needs and the MoD’s economic limits. Run
a controlled process of disposing moveable assets and reinvest its sales revenues in
the development of the armed forces.

Decrease the scope and number of military training areas so as to be appropriate to the
Czech Armed Forces needs.

Achieve a balanced economy in the military hospitals and other medical facilities by
means of their restructuring.

Lead the state-owned enterprises established by the Ministry of Defence to their greater
independence and competitiveness.

In the fi eld of administrative control:

Create a consolidated managerial control system at the Ministry of Defence standing
on three pillars: 1) control executed by competent persons in managing positions,
2) control carried out by specialized authorities, and 3) evaluation of process effectiveness
through an internal audit. Individual control authorities should share information.

Implement an anti-corruption programme based on principles of the code of ethics and
public transparency.


-----

Concentrate on mapping particular risks, setting up a system of continuous controls,
monitoring non-standard transactions, and assigning personal responsibility in the event
of rules and regulations being violated.

Progressively update the methodology of managerial control processes on the basis of
feedback and systematically evaluated experience.

In the fi eld of organisation:

Introduce a new organisational model resulting from analyses of processes and
functions, both in the civilian segment of the Ministry of Defence and the General Staff
of the Czech Armed Forces, bearing in mind that the MoD is a strategic, concept-setting,
normative and administrative body having minimum executive competences.

In a maximum scope, relieve the General Staff of the Czech Armed Forces from executing
administrative and other activities that are not directly related to its main mission – the
exercise of command over the Czech Armed Forces.

Transfer management activities executed by the Joint Forces Command and Support
Forces Command to the appropriate units of the General Staff of the Czech Armed
Forces or the newly established Land and Air Force Command.

Centralize and transfer executive activities that are not directly related to concept-setting
and administrative work from individual organisational units of the Ministry of Defence to
its subordinate organisations, which cover the cross-sectional servicing of, if possible,
all the MoD components.

###### The White Paper Implementation

This document presents the intentions of the MoD sector’s development for the next
ten years. With regard to the fi nancial situation of the Ministry of Defence, the proposed
measures must be implemented as soon as possible. For instance, activities connected
with the transfer to target-oriented planning, introduction of a new system of personnel
management or the prioritisation of investments is already in progress. The year 2012 will
be the key period for implementing the White Paper. However, many activities related to
its implementation will go beyond this horizon. The process of its implementation will be
progressively monitored by the MoD Board for Planning, a body specifi cally established
for this purpose. No later than fi ve years after its publishing, we recommend carrying
out a comprehensive review of the White Paper, evaluating the results achieved and, if
necessary, updating the document.

###### Traditions of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic

Some foreign armed forces follow the rule that units, while taking part in military
ceremonies, are commemorating history, which includes not only successes but also
losses. These traditions contribute to the strengthening of professional pride and esprit
de corps of the unit while broadening civic responsibility for national defence. In their
mission, today’s Czech Armed Forces have links to their old as well as young historical
traditions, mainly those that are ingrained in the history of our nation over the past
hundred or so years.

The modern Czech state was formed during the First World War with an active
contribution of tens of thousands of Czech soldiers and members of the Czechoslovak
Legions fi ghting in Russia, France, Italy and the Balkans. Diplomatic activities of Tomáš
G. Masaryk and his colleagues in the capitals of the countries belonging to the Triple
Entente were greatly aided by the combat activities of the legionnaires fi ghting on
several fronts during World War I.

The engagement of the Czechoslovak Legions in battles against Austria-Hungary and
Germany, albeit only marginal from a strategic point of view, represented a signifi cant
political and symbolic support to Masaryk’s efforts for achieving Czechoslovak
independence. At the same time there is no doubt that the battles at Zborov, Bakhmach,
Terron, Doss Alto, Piave, etc. proved admirable heroism, self-sacrifi ce, loyalty and military
skills of the legionnaires and became the model for the following the next generation of
Czechoslovak soldiers endorsing the democratic values of Masaryk’s state.

The actions of the Czechoslovak Legions on the Eastern Front, their subsequent
engagement in the Russian civil war against the Bolsheviks, winning control over the
Trans-Siberian Railway and fi nally the round-the-world journey of sixty thousand soldiers
back to the newly established Czechoslovak state belong among the magnifi cent
episodes of 20[th] century military history.

Having returned to their homeland, the legionnaires created the backbone of the newly
built Czechoslovak Armed Forces and their traditions became a source of pride for
soldiers and citizens of the First Republic. The founders of the Czechoslovak state,


-----

headed by President Masaryk, were no pacifi sts. On the contrary, they respected the
fact that strong and reliable armed forces were indispensable for defending shared
values. They believed, from ethical and practical points of view, that in some situations,
use of force is a better choice than resignation.

The Czechoslovak Armed Forces of the interwar period were modern and well-equipped.
Within the framework of the modernisation programme of armament and defence
systems that took place in the second half of the 1930s, the armed forces came to
be characterised by outstanding patriotism and commitment to defending their country.
Moreover, their exceptionally large numbers as seen from today’s perspective were
ready to conduct fl exible manoeuvres in defensive operations and make full use of the
state-of-the-art system of border fortifi cations and, for the fi rst time, mechanised forces.
As the two mobilisations in the spring and fall of 1938 demonstrated, the armed forces
were well prepared.

The Munich Agreement, albeit one of the darkest moments in the history of our
armed forces, is also a prime example of the armed forces’ loyalty to the democratic
constitutional system. Despite the perfectly conducted mobilisation and will to fi ght,
the armed forces adhered to the decision made by political leaders and respected the
principle of civilian control of the military in such a dramatic situation.

The Second World War serves as another rich source of positive examples for the
contemporary Czech Armed Forces. During the war, tens of thousands of Czechoslovak
volunteers, many of whom had served in the pre-Munich Czechoslovak Armed Forces,
gained valuable combat experience. Secret emigrations from the homeland aimed at
joining the allied powers to fi ght against Nazi Germany were by themselves an act of
courage and resolution.

Czechoslovak pilots had already taken part in the Battle of France, but the height of their
war engagement was the Battle of Britain. To paraphrase the famous words of Winston
Churchill, they joined “the few to whom so many owe.” Thousands of Czechoslovak
fl ight and ground personnel served in the Royal Air Force units till the end of the war.
Hundreds of them paid the ultimate price for their courage.

Czechoslovak land forces also operated in the WWII arena. The 11[th] Infantry BattalionEast excelled on the North African Front in defending the besieged port of Tobruk, in
spite of being outnumbered by German and Italian forces. In the fi nal stage of WWII,
the Czechoslovak Independent Armoured Brigade participated in the liberation of
Western Europe, including the famous siege of Dunkerque. Thousands of soldiers from
the 1[st ] Czechoslovak Army Corps accomplished exhausting combat missions on the
Eastern Front where its units suffered heavy losses but showed true heroism at many


-----

battles from Sokolovo to Dukla and then on the territory of their homeland during its
liberation.

Offi cers and soldiers of the pre-WWII Czechoslovak Armed Forces also played a key
role in the homeland resistance. The Nation’s Defence, a secret organisation consisting
of underground structures of the former Czechoslovak Armed Forces, was the most
signifi cant rebelling organisation at the beginning of WWII. Soldiers belonged among
the most active resistance fi ghters throughout the war. The homeland resistance was
also supported by the Czechoslovak government exiled in London that deployed plenty
of special forces parachute teams to the territory of the occupied country. Their most
important mission was undoubtedly the successful assassination of Reinhardt Heydrich,
the Protector of Bohemia and Moravia.

The post-war illusion of a return to the First Republic’s values disappeared in a short
time. After the communist coup in 1948, the Czechoslovak Armed Forces were rebuilt
according to the Soviet military manuals and became one of the pillars of the new
totalitarian system. Countless war heroes, mainly those who fought on the Western
Fronts, were incarcerated, while others managed to emigrate. Full recognition of their
courage and merits was not able to take place until after 1989.

Nonetheless, even the twenty-year communist indoctrination could not prevent some
soldiers from backing the democratisation efforts at the end of the 1960s. Many of them
openly disapproved the occupation of Czechoslovakia by the Warsaw Pact in 1968 and
were forced to leave the armed forces.

Following the fall of the communist regime, the defence sector faced an urgent need for
radical transformation. It was an extremely diffi cult task since it entailed a simultaneous
reform of two different areas. First, the armed forces had to be integrated into the new
democratic society. Their loyalty to democratic values and the new political system had
to be ensured, and their subordination to civilian leadership and democratic control
had to be enforced. Second, and due to the profound changes within the security
environment, the Czech Armed Forces had to undergo a widespread modernisation
in their scope, structure, capabilities, command and control, training, equipment and
personnel management.

Modernisation was based on the adoption of western procedures and standards and
was largely motivated also by a fundamental turn in the Czech foreign policy, aimed
primarily at rapid and complete integration into the political, economic, security and
military structures of Western Europe. The Czech Republic aspired to become an equal
part in the western political and security environment, using its security guarantees and,


-----

in return, contributing to building security in the whole Euro-Atlantic area. Joining NATO
in 1999 and the EU in 2004 were two key milestones in the pursuance of this goal.

Thanks to its NATO membership, the Czech Republic has now achieved the most
reliable security guarantees in its history. However, to be able to count on mechanisms
of collective defence and take advantage of our membership in the Alliance in the
future, we have to contribute to the development of defence solidarity among the allies.
Therefore, joining the Alliance has not released our country from the responsibility for
our own defence. On the contrary, our responsibilities have increased. Membership
implies a permanent necessity of strengthening our reputation as a reliable ally and fair
contributor to the Alliance’s collective security effort.

Our allies have praised the professional Czech Armed Forces whose capabilities in
some areas are of the highest standards in NATO. The armed forces already have new
heroes and veterans and, thus, their own modern traditions. Hence they are building on
the heritage of their predecessors with dignity, especially those who directly participated
in defending our country and restoring its sovereignty.

Since 1989, the Czech Armed Forces have been engaged in many international
operations and have participated in stabilising high-risk countries and regions. It was the
Czechoslovak Chemical Unit which learned the fi rst combat lessons during the Gulf War I
in 1991. Then followed the deployment of the Czech Armed Forces on missions in the
Balkans (Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Macedonia), Africa (Democratic
Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Liberia, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and Chad), Middle
East (Kuwait, Iraq) and Afghanistan. Czech military personnel have achieved a high
reputation from our allies and partners.

Thanks to their successful engagement in missions abroad and signifi cant help in saving
lives and properties affl icted by natural disasters (especially fl oods) at home, the Czech
Armed Forces have gained considerable trust on the part of the public.

From a long-term perspective, approximately two-thirds of Czech citizens trust the armed
forces, which means that they belong among the most respected state institutions.
For personnel of the Czech Armed Forces, this is a clear signal that their service is
meaningful. Hence, the signifi cance of the White Paper is to help the Czech Armed
Forces maintain their trust and reputation among our citizens and allies and develop
their capabilities further for the sake of national defence and democratic values in the
spirit of their best traditions.

###### Chapter 1

 Doorways to the Future

 Attitude of the Czech Government to National Defence Building

1.1 The White Paper expresses the effort by the Czech Government for achieving
long-term stabilisation of conceptual assignments for the MoD sector; defi ning
its priorities, functions, and related organisational components; raising the
effectiveness of activities and employment of the armed forces, including
training, education and preparation of personnel; specifying defence planning
principles, ensuring a predictable budgetary framework and increasing the
effectiveness of participation of other ministries in national defence.

1.2 Its aim is to defi ne and systematically interconnect measures and procedures
leading to the fulfi lment of the transformational goals, as formulated in previous
conceptual documents. This document provides a programme framework for
optimising the structures and processes in the Czech Ministry of Defence fi elds
of responsibility, which have been so far hindered by various political, economic
and organisational obstacles.

1.3 In order to achieve future continuity in meeting the conclusions and
recommendations of the White Paper, all democratic powers in the Czech
Republic shall reach a consensus on all issues pertaining to national defence.
The objective of the open and unanimous approach applied while drafting this
document was to help establish such a consensus.

1.4 A predictable budget framework is an indispensable condition for attaining
a long-term sustainability for a systematic and planned development of the
Czech Ministry of Defence. The White Paper specifi es the basic parameters of
such a framework.


-----

1.5 The _White Paper reacts to dynamic changes in the security environment_
over the last decade and builds on the experience of the Armed Forces of
the Czech Republic[1] (AFCR) from foreign missions, their assistance during
natural disasters in the Czech Republic, and joint training and activities with
partners from the North Atlantic Alliance and the European Union.

1.6 The White Paper is based on many concept-setting documents[2] and the principle
statement of policy of the Czech Government. The Czech active engagement in
the NATO system of collective defence, strong transatlantic link, development
of capabilities in the framework of the European Union (EU) for responding to
crises, and cooperation with partner countries are the fundamental premises for
attaining effi cient national defence. A specifi c requirement rests in supporting
civilian bodies in non-military crisis situations and deepening cooperation of the
Czech Armed Forces with the elements of the Czech Integrated Rescue System
(IRS) and the Czech Police in attaining internal order and security, as stipulated
by the Czech legislation.

1.7 The Czech Republic is an organic part of the fellowship of democratic
countries associated in the NATO and the EU. Therefore, the White Paper
takes into consideration the fundamental concept-setting documents of these
organisations, primarily NATO´s New Strategic Concept (2010).

###### Civilian Management and Democratic Control

1.8 The Czech Republic strictly applies the principles of civilian management and
democratic control over the armed forces, as stipulated in the Constitution of the
Czech Republic and other legal documents functionally distributed among the
individual pillars of state authority. The White Paper is based on these principles
and, at the same time, respects the division of the decision-making responsibility
and authority between the civilian and military components.

1.9 Defence issues, including ways of using fi nances allocated from public sources
for building national defence and also the position of the armed forces in the
society, concern all the citizens. In this regard, the White Paper supports
information openness on the part of the Ministry of Defence and armed forces.

###### Designation of Competencies and Responsibility for Defence

1.10 The main mission of the armed forces lies in their preparation for defending the
Czech sovereignty and territorial integrity and protecting it from an external attack.
They can also be deployed to carry out rescue activities; clear aftermath of natural
disasters; take part in international peace-building, peace support and peacekeeping operations; and support rescue and humanitarian missions.

1.11 Complete and comprehensive defence of the Czech Republic can be attained
only in the framework of shared responsibilities and mutual assistance within
the system of NATO collective defence. As a member of this system, the Czech
Republic has accepted an appropriate portion of responsibility for security and
defence of its allies, in the same way as the allies accept part of responsibility
for defence of the Czech Republic. However, membership in international
organisations does not exempt the Czech Republic from its primary national
defence responsibility.

1.12 Membership in the European Union is also important for the Czech Republic’s
national defence and security. The Czech Republic supports the development
of the EU military capabilities, in accordance with the process of building NATO
capabilities.

1.13 The Government of the Czech Republic bears prime responsibility for national
defence, which is implemented through the armed forces. In a broad sense,
this responsibility is further delegated to other bodies of the state and selfadministration, and thus all citizens.


-----

###### Political-Military Ambitions

1.14 The political-military ambitions, as described in the Transformation of the Czech
_Republic Ministry of Defence Sector (2007) and Military Strategy of the Czech_
_Republic (2008), remain the fundamental political guidance for the development_
of military capabilities.

1.15 The armed forces are deployed outside the Czech territory solely in accordance
with the Czech constitutional order, pertinent national laws, and principles of the
Charter of the United Nations (UN). Deployments are executed in the framework
of broader efforts of the international community within the whole spectrum of
operations led by NATO, the EU, the UN or ad hoc coalitions.

1.16 As for NATO Article 5 collective defence operations, the Czech Republic
provides the land and air forces earmarked for NATO in the defence planning
process, the main component of which is a brigade task force on the basis of
a medium-size mechanised brigade. In an armed confl ict of such an extent that
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Czech Republic is endangered,
all troops and equipment of the professional armed forces will be employed,
including military draft call.

1.17 As for NATO Non-Article 5 collective defence operations:

a) the armed forces can, gradually or simultaneously, accomplish missions
related to conducting combat actions and humanitarian aid, post-confl ict
stabilisation and country restoration;

b) the Czech Republic is capable of simultaneously deploying the following
formations[1]:
i. brigade task force for a period of six months, without rotation,
ii. a battalion task force on a six-month rotation. During the deployment of
a battalion task force, the armed forces are able to provide headquarters for
a multinational brigade task force up to a period of one year[2],

1 The above-stated task forces may include, in addition to land forces units, air force, combat support
or combat service support units. In such cases, their period of deployment can be shortened or their
rotation capabilities may be reduced.

2 Headquarters for a multinational task force can be provided only if the brigade task force is not
deployed, as stipulated in paragraph i.

iii. a company task force on a six-month rotation,
iv. a task force up to the battalion level earmarked for the NATO Response
Force (NRF) or EU Battle Groups (BG);

c) furthermore, the Czech Republic is able to contribute special task forces
or groups of specialised personnel, such as special units and detachments
or expert teams in the fi eld of training and mentoring as well as groups of
military personnel for international staffs and observation missions.

1.18 To support civilian bodies in non-military crises:

a) on the Czech territory, the armed forces are ready to support the Integrated
Rescue System or the Czech Police with available forces, equipment and
material to the extent necessary, which can be further reinforced by Active
Reserve units. In principle, all forces, equipment and material can be rendered
to the IRS or the Czech Police;
b) outside the Czech territory, the armed forces are ready to support civilian
bodies and organisations with immediately available forces, equipment and
material.
1.19 The _White Paper expects an increase in the percentage of deployable and_
sustainable forces in accordance with NATO recommendations. Supporting
the deployability of the armed forces by NATO standards leads to improvement
of their quality, performance and cooperation with the allies, both in NATO
Non-Article 5 collective defence operations and international crisis response
operations conducted abroad.

###### Legislative Framework

1.20 The process of ensuring defence of the Czech Republic complies with active
legal documents, primarily the Constitution of the Czech Republic; Constitutional
Act 110/1998, On Security of the Czech Republic; Act 219/1999, On the armed
_forces of the Czech Republic; Act 221/1999,_ _On Professional Soldiers; Act_
222/1999, On Arrangements for Defence of the Czech Republic; Act 585/2004,
_On Conscription and its Ensuring (Conscription Act)._

1.21 The implementation of the _White Paper will require changes to some of the_
aforementioned documents and other legal norms, by-laws and internal legal
provisions.

1.22 The _White Paper has been prepared with an outlook for the next ten years._
Within fi ve years (i.e. no later than 2016) it shall undergo a review of the success
rate of the implementation of its recommendations into practice. If necessary,
the White Paper shall be updated.

###### Chapter 2

 Strategic Environment

 Background

2.1 The environment infl uencing the Czech Republic’s security is complex, multilayered and continuously changing. In the long-term, it will be characterised
with highly dynamic changes, with increasingly diverse actors, and ever more
complex interconnectedness of security trends and factors. However, it is often
diffi cult to localise threats, risks and their sources, as most of them currently have
non-governmental and transnational character. All of these factors contribute to
erasing the differences between the internal and external security of a nation
because many threats and their consequences are not easily predicted.

2.2 The aforementioned characteristics require an open-minded approach to the
issues of defence and security, which combines both military and non-military
tools and methods. Their application is necessary both for prevention against
arising problems and for resolution of confl icts.

2.3 Threats associated with the use of unconventional means often prevail over
more commonly identifi ed threats in the Euro-Atlantic region. The probability
of threat of a massive military attack against the Czech territory is low in the
foreseeable future. A basic guarantee of this favourable position lies in the Czech
Republic’s NATO and EU membership and its good relations with neighbouring
countries.

2.4 The stability of security relations in the Euro-Atlantic region is in contrast with
the increasingly complex security problems linked to certain trends in the global
environment. The potential of asymmetric threats is growing, and the potential
for the spread of security risks, even from relatively remote areas affected by
local and regional confl icts, is increasing. The impact of these trends on the
security of the Czech Republic and its allies cannot be underestimated.


-----

2.5 Geographically remote incidents and processes can jeopardise the Czech
Republic’s security. Factors, which on their own do not present a threat, have
the potential to lead to instability and contribute to the rise of confl icts and
geographical spreading of threats when combined together.

2.6 The most signifi cant processes containing risk or confl ict potential are the rise
of power and military capacity of new global actors, weak and failing states,
strengthening of non-state actors, weakening of institutions and mechanisms
of global and regional cooperation, security consequences of a degradation of
the environment, geographically unbalanced demographic development and
exploitation of natural resources.

2.7 Primary sources of threat include the following: political radicalism and its
manifestations, especially terrorism tied with escalated nationalism, ideological
or religious fundamentalism; proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and
their carriers; growing accessibility and applicability of non-military technologies
for various attacks, cybernetic assaults, consequences of regional confl icts,
and organized crime. While all of the above-stated threats are well recognised,
the unprecedented level of their interconnectedness and potential for mutual
reinforcement is undoubtedly a new phenomenon.


-----

2.8 The Czech Republic is among the growing number of countries exposed to
new threats generated from the economic interconnectedness and increasing
dependence of developed countries on complex communication, transport and
energy infrastructure.

2.9 Terrorist and criminal networks and their recruitment of new members benefi t
from the unbalanced economic development, population explosion in unstable
regions of the world, inability of governmental bodies in failing states to maintain
public order, and unobstructed spreading of radical ideas.

2.10 The deterioration of the environment in some regions of the world and the
ensuing inability of some states to feed their rapidly growing population can
result in humanitarian crises with direct impact on local, national and international
structures. This impact is inclusive of escalating political radicalism and local
armed confl icts accompanied with migration.

2.11 Global economic and demographic growth places high demands on the
availability of natural resources, which has magnifi ed the risky dependence
on fossil fuels. The importance of protecting

sole suppliers of strategic raw materials to

###### signifi cant impact on the strategic

enforce their political and security interests,

###### environment. which can have negative impacts upon the

Czech Republic and some of its European
allies and partners.

2.12 The ambitions of rising powers can have a signifi cant impact on the strategic
environment. On one hand, these countries are interested in building regional
stability and observing international standards. On the other hand, their
regional aspirations are tied to increasing military budgets and growing military
capabilities. Their demand for key raw materials is also increasing, which is why
they strive to raise their infl uence in strategic areas.

2.13 To a large extent, security threats and risks are connected to weak or failed
states. The inability of these states to ensure national defence, provide their
citizens with security and enforce the rule of law is often a consequence and
a source of local confl icts, which may also bring negative impact on security in
the Czech Republic.

2.14 Non-state actors take advantage of opportunities stemming from integration
processes in communication systems, transport and trade faster and more
skilfully than states and international organizations. The signifi cance of states as
actors with a monopoly on the use of force and the regulation of key information,


-----

economic and migration fl ows has been diminishing. On the contrary, the ability
of non-state actors to threaten state interests and security of their citizens has
been growing.

2.15 As a consequence of the budgetary and social impact of the economic and
fi nancial crisis, many European states have identifi ed a growing tendency to
pursue national interests rather than joint efforts, including elements of economic
protectionism. Cases of defence policy renationalization are emerging. However,
these can undermine the defence solidarity and operational effectiveness
of the NATO and the EU.

2.16 Decreasing defence investments in Europe further enlarges the asymmetry
of defence effectiveness and military capabilities between the USA and its
European allies. Reductions in defence budgets also imply the risk of weakening
interests to maintain a strong transatlantic defence link from the American
perspective. While ten years ago, the USA covered 50 per cent of total NATO
defence expenditures, its share has increased to nearly 75 per cent today.

2.17 The role of international non-governmental organizations in the fi eld of
humanitarian aid, confl ict prevention and post-confl ict reconstruction has been
increasing. Therefore, they should be part of comprehensive approach to
ensuring security when possible.


-----

###### The Czech Republic’s Security Interests

2.18 The Czech Republic’s security interests are defi ned in its Security Strategy.
Vital interests include safeguarding the existence of the Czech Republic, its
sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence; defending democracy
and the rule of law and protecting fundamental human rights and freedoms of
the population. The Czech Republic’s vital interests are achieved through the
pursuit of its strategic interests.

2.19 A crucial internal strategic condition for the nation’s viability and resistance
to security risks and threats rests in preserving operability of critical national
infrastructure and effective functioning of national institutions. These institutions
include the armed forces, as their tasks involve attack prevention and
management, coping with the aftermath of natural disasters, industrial accidents
or serious epidemics.

2.20 Political and economic stability of the environment in which the Czech Republic
exists is the key external condition. More than three quarters of the Czech Gross
Domestic Products (GDP) depend upon export and import. The extraordinary
openness of the Czech economy renders the country dependant on the external
environment, primarily in terms of market accessibility and availability of energy
sources. Due to its geopolitical position, strength and character of economy, the
Czech Republic prefers multilateral activities in cooperation with international
organizations and other groupings of states that support peaceful resolution of
confl ict, principles of international law, collective approaches to security, and
mutually benefi cial economic cooperation.

2.21 The Czech Republic Armed Forces form part of the multilateral solution to threats
against Euro-Atlantic security, the sources of which are also found outside the
European territory.

2.22 When engaging the armed forces in NATO or EU-led multinational operations, the
Czech Republic reaches its important strategic interests. These include building
NATO/EU solidarity and cohesion, establishing a reputation as a trustworthy
and reliable ally, and appropriately contributing to the consolidation of security
in the Euro-Atlantic area. Lessons learned from international operations and
qualitative criteria, which the armed forces have to meet prior to being deployed,
enhance their combat capabilities and effectiveness for contingent collective
defence of the Czech territory.

2.23 The development and continued modernisation of the armed forces, together
with their deployments on international operations and missions, is a method
which demonstrates how the Czech Republic can participate in maintaining


-----

peace and stability in Europe. As guaranteed by NATO and EU membership,
this method consolidates the safeguards of collective defence, shared security,
solidarity and mutual assistance in case our territory and citizens come under
immediate threat.

2.24 The following are the strategic interests of the Czech Republic related to its
defence policy and prospective employment of the armed forces:

� security and stability – especially in the Euro-Atlantic area;
� prevention and solution of local or regional confl icts and alleviation of their
aftermath;
� maintenance of the UN‘s global stabilisation role and raising the effectiveness
of this organization;
� consolidation of NATO/EU cohesion, effectiveness and reliability, and
preservation of a functional and reliable transatlantic link;
� building of a strategic partnership between NATO and the EU, including
the deepening of cooperation between the two organizations in the
complementary development of NATO/EU defence and security capabilities;
� development of the OSCE‘s role in the prevention of armed confl icts,
democratisation and enhancement of mutual trust and security;
� maintenance of a functional and transparent control of conventional armament
in Europe;
� development of regional cooperation in political, security and economic
fi elds;
� availability of strategic raw material resources;
� support of international stability through active participation in NATO/EU
policy and programmes of cooperation with partner nations;
� upholding of democracy, fundamental freedoms and principles of the rule
of law;
� prevention and suppression of political extremism and its manifested forms,
mainly terrorism;
� prevention and suppression of threats having an infl uence on security of the
Czech Republic and its allies.

2.25 The effort to prevent risk situations from evolving into an open confl ict also
belongs among the Czech interests. Therefore, security and defence policy also
entails preventive diplomacy, measures for strengthening international trust
and armament control mechanisms, and development of partnership relations,
including assistance to other nations with reforms of the armed forces.


-----

###### Security Threats and Risks

2.26 Based on the specifi cation of today’s strategic environment, the potential
threats and risks that may harm the Czech security and defence interests are
as follows:

� political extremism and its manifested forms (mainly terrorism), mass riots,
and sabotage activities;
� proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems and
their potential use;
� cybernetic attacks;
� disruption of critical infrastructures (e.g. communication, transport, energy);
� interruptions in supply of strategic raw materials;
� weakening of international organizations and institutions that are crucial for
the Czech Republic’s security, especially the North Atlantic Alliance and the
European Union;
� endangering the functioning of mechanisms and institutions of cooperative
security, and arising of disputes among world powers;
� regional political, economic, social, environmental and demographic
instability;
� creation of areas of infl uence through political, economic and military
pressure;
� regional and local confl icts within the Euro-Atlantic area and its near abroad,
including long-lasting unsolved confl icts;
� breakdown of state authorities in confl ict-affl icted areas and the emergence
of failed states;
� mass illegal migration;
� organised crime;
� humanitarian disasters regardless of their causes;
� natural disasters and industrial accidents.

2.27 The threat of terrorism as a method of enforcing political goals through violence
remains high. It is characterised by the existence of transnational networks
of loosely interconnected groups sharing, even without a unifi ed command,
ideology, goals and plans to achieve them as well as fi nancial resources and
information to increase their destructive potential.

2.28 Some state and non-state actors strive both openly and secretly to possess
weapons of mass destruction. Their proliferation can bring serious security
consequences to citizens of NATO and EU member countries.

2.29 The possibility of the use of ballistic missiles, with either conventional or
unconventional warheads, presents another specifi c threat. Their ability to hit
the territory of the Czech Republic or its allies puts a high demand on adopting
both active and passive countermeasures.


-----

2.30 The trend of increased dependence on information technologies and complex
communication systems leads to a higher vulnerability of society and the state.
Attacks against the information and communication infrastructure (cybernetic
assaults) present a new method of warfare, but they can also imply criminal
motives. Massive cybernetic attacks can have a negative impact on the
functioning of the society and the state, including its security components.

2.31 Transport and energy networks represent additional important parts of the state’s
critical infrastructure. Political pressures and criminal threats, including politically
motivated manipulations with deliveries of strategic resources, sabotages or
economic criminality, can jeopardize energy infrastructure.

2.32 Ethnic and territorial confl icts, which may develop in the vicinity of Europe,
endanger the broader regional stability. These confl icts can cause a number of
negative trends directly threatening the territory of the Alliance and EU member
states (mass migration, terrorism or humanitarian crisis) and can also lead draw
other international actors, including Czech allies, into the confl ict.

2.33 Protracted unresolved confl icts in Europe and its immediate neighbourhood
pose another specifi c risk. These confl icts are accompanied by a number
of negative phenomena – the spreading of regional instability, violations of
human rights, paralysed mechanisms of cooperative security, and creation of
an environment suitable for criminal groups with cross-boarder reach. External
actors pursuing their regional power ambitions can also make use of these
confl icts.

2.34 Related security threats entail unilateral attempts by states to build their own areas
of infl uence by means of combined political, economic and military pressure.
These tendencies contain the risk of eroding political and legal obligations relevant
to European security (gradual weakening of control mechanisms in the fi eld of
conventional armed forces, inclusive of the principle of indispensable approval by
a state to accept foreign troops on its territory, or violating the Helsinki Final Act of
the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and its related documents
and principles, and the OSCE principles).

2.35 The signifi cance of transnational organized crime has increased in today’s
complex, multilayered and interconnected environment. Criminal networks show an
increased ability to disrupt institutions and values of the rule of law, infi ltrate into
state administrative bodies and threaten security of individual citizens. An important
part of their activities is focused on human, narcotics and weapons traffi cking
which, inter alia, hampers the stabilisation and reconstruction efforts taking place in
failed states and within the scope of local or regional confl icts. Differences between
political and criminal motives are often being erased, thereby enabling terrorist and
criminal networks to intensify their cooperation and interconnectivity.

###### Chapter 3

 The Roles and Functions of the Czech Armed Forces

 Roles of the Czech Armed Forces

3.1 The Czech Armed Forces assume the following roles:

i. defending the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Czech Republic;
participating in collective defence of territories of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization allies;
ii. international cooperation;
iii. supporting civilian bodies.

###### Functions in Support of the Czech National and NATO Collective Defence

3.2 The Czech Republic shares its security and defence interests with other NATO
member states. The Ministry of Defence is responsible for national defence and
coordination of its preparation. The Czech Armed Forces plan, prepare and
implement defence of their territory within the framework of NATO collective
defence and in accordance with Article 5 of the Washington Treaty.

3.3 Defence operations can be either of a high or low intensity, and may be
conducted inside or outside the Czech territory at various distances from its
border. High intensity operations are conducted with use of maximum military
forces and equipment deployed by NATO allies, whereas low intensity operations
can be carried out with a smaller amount of NATO capacities. Decisions on the
character and intensity of retaliation against an armed attack on one or more
allies are made by NATO member states in compliance with the Alliance’s
principles and procedures.


-----

3.4 Defence can be conducted in two basic modes depending on the situation:

� In an armed confl ict where the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
Czech Republic are endangered, while defending either its own territory or
the territory of nearby allies, the state of war is declared. In terms of its
organizational structure and command & control arrangements, the Ministry
of Defence is transformed to a wartime organization. The Czech Republic
transfers its forces and equipment earmarked in NATO defence planning
under the authority of the designated bodies of the Alliance. The General
Staff of the Czech Armed Forces retains the command authority over those
forces which have not been moved under the allied command. The Czech
Armed Forces support their own units deployed in operations while engaging
in preparatory activities for defending the Czech territory and receiving
military support from NATO allies. Military bodies assume the responsibility
for running air traffi c control within the Czech Republic airspace.

� The Czech Republic does not necessarily have to declare a state of war for
the defence of a remote territory of an allied state. In such an event, forces
and equipment earmarked in NATO defence planning are transferred under
the authority of the designated NATO bodies. The Czech Armed Forces
support their own units deployed in operations, continue in conducting
activities in their peacetime establishment and implement the planned
preliminary measures to prepare for elevated alert levels. Situations of low
intensity threats against the Czech territory can be dealt with by the armed
forces either by themselves or with NATO support.


-----

###### Functions in International Cooperation

3.5 The Czech Armed Forces cooperate with foreign military forces by the authority
of international agreements. Furthermore, they participate in various activities to
support peace and security, especially in international operations and missions.

3.6 Based on analyses of the strategic environment, the participation in international
crisis response operations will present the most probable form of the Czech
Armed Forces´ combat employment in the near future, both inside and outside
NATO/EU states. Whether gradual or simultaneous, the missions will include
the following operations: peacemaking, peace support and peacekeeping,
post-confl ict reconstruction, stabilisation of state authorities and assistance in
introducing the rule of law.

3.7 Crisis response operations are usually complex, thus calling for political, civilian
and military measures and instruments. An operation is often characterised by
interconnected missions with varying degree of intensity of combat phases.
Enemies usually apply asymmetric methods of fi ghting, and the boundaries
between combat zones and civilian areas often disappear.

3.8 Peacemaking operations are conducted without the consent of confl ict parties.
Their aim is to make the hostile parties terminate combat actions, cease
violence against civilians, and deactivate their armed forces. The Czech
Armed Forces transfer their capacities, together with those capabilities that
are functionally appropriate to the character,
environment and intensity of the confl ict,

###### An operation is often characterized

activities. Similar procedures are applied in
conducting operations led by the EU or an
_ad hoc coalition._

3.9 Peace support or peacekeeping operations are usually conducted with the
consent of the parties in question. Their aim is to prevent a confl ict from arising
or escalating, monitor activities of opposing armed forces, prevent them from
initiating or resuming combat actions, committing violence against civilians
and to achieve a gradual stabilisation and restoration of peace in the area. As
declared in the Political-Military Ambitions of the Czech Republic, the Czech
Armed Forces contribute their forces and equipment under the authority of the
designated bodies of the Alliance and support their operational activities.


-----

3.10 International operations can include assistance in evacuation of civilians,
alleviating or coping with the aftermath of disasters, humanitarian operations or
search and rescue operations.

3.11 As a part of missions in international operations, the Czech Armed Forces
can also be engaged in reshaping or building a local defence sector through
mentoring and training of the local armed forces.

3.12 In today’s evolving security environment of complex operations, the objectives
cannot be achieved merely by military instruments. The Czech Armed Forces are
able to coordinate their activities with other actors involved in responding to a crisis
situation, primarily with civilian governmental and non-governmental organizations.

3.13 The Czech Armed Forces have appropriate capabilities to accomplish their
missions in cooperation with the above-stated actors. The complexity of
operations and the variety of actors cooperating in different phases of operations
necessitate a fl exible and multitasking approach from the deployed elements of
the Czech Armed Forces.

3.14 The Czech Armed Forces initiate the cooperation with other actors, if possible,
already in the planning phase of operations.

3.15 Various forms of cooperation between the units of the Czech Armed Force’s
and a local population can become a part of missions being accomplished
in crisis response international operations outside NATO and EU territories.
During the period of deployment in an environment culturally distinct from that
of NATO/EU, the deployed personnel shall respect its specifi c features.

3.16 The Czech Armed Forces personnel can also participate in civilian operations
and monitoring missions led by international organizations.

###### Functions in Supporting Civilian Bodies

3.17 The Czech Armed Forces can be used to support the Integrated Rescue System,
i.e. in case of natural disasters, industrial accidents and other emergencies,
including immediate rescue activities and subsequent clearing works.

3.18 The forces and equipment are used as available to assist civilian entities in
coping with a crisis situation, both in the homeland territory and abroad as
a part of international rescue and humanitarian operations. When needed, the
Czech Armed Forces deploy primarily medical, engineering and CBRN defence
units or their segments equipped with required capabilities. Units of the Active
Reserve may be called up and deployed as well.


-----

3.19 Apart from the aforementioned situations, the Czech Armed Forces can be used
for guarding the assets critical for national defence, reinforcing the Czech Police
to protect the state border or acting as riot police or protective service.

as to support cultural, educational, sports and social events. Furthermore, they
can be employed in other contingencies endangering lives, health, property of

###### Chapter 4

 Defence Planning

4.1 Defence planning interlinks and harmonises the missions, objectives and needs
stemming from the obligation on the part of the Ministry of Defence to guarantee
effective defence of the Czech Republic with the resources and fi nancial means
allocated for defence. It stems from political tasking by the Czech Government and
political military ambitions, and is executed on the basis of continuous analysis
of security risks, threats, and expected scenarios of their development. Czech
defence planning is intertwined, both factually and in time, with NATO/EU defence
planning and processes of military and non-military capability development,
particularly with respect to fulfi lling the NATO Force Goals. It is an essential
instrument for strategic management of the MoD’s areas of responsibility.

4.2 Building a system of defence and security is a long-term and continuous
process. Therefore, the purpose of defence planning lies in ensuring optimal
activities and development of the MoD and armed forces in the short-term,
mid-term and long-term horizon.

4.3 In this regard, its central mission lies in developing capabilities of the armed
forces. This is a long-term process that necessitates taking into consideration
the current and assumed changes of the international security environment,
evolution of military and defence technologies, the country’s economic situation
and demographic trends.

4.4 Defence planning applies the Management by Objectives. The Objectives are
formulated in such a manner as to enable an unbiased evaluation of the level of
their achievement in connection with allocated fi nancial resources. A unifi ed and
obligatory set of objectives is being created to coordinate and integrate defence
planning with other forms of planning, as well as other follow on processes,
including budgeting. Hence, objectives and fi nancial planning are closely
intertwined.


-----

4.5 In the framework of the planning process, objectives are further defi ned into
specifi c measures and tasks. The methods of their attainment must be clear,
i.e. they must specify personal responsibility, tasks, deadlines, resources, costs
and required quality. This is also a precondition for monitoring the process of
achieving the objectives.

4.6 Developing objectives into measures and tasks must be a complex activity
that includes qualitative as well as quantitative aspects and criteria, such as
doctrinal directives, optimizing organizational structures and their capabilities,
adjusting training and education, supplying material, leadership and personnel
management, defi ning requirements for personnel skills and abilities,
infrastructure, interoperability and international cooperation.

4.7 Such an approach to the development of capabilities enables the planners
to create a complete description of the capabilities, including the process of
their development. Capabilities development planning includes the life-cycle
of capabilities, which also incorporates costs for maintaining capabilities
at a desired quality throughout the entire life span.


-----

4.8 Prioritisation is a key method in the process of defence planning. Within its
framework, the achievability of the objectives in relation to the availability of
resources is assessed. In case some requirements cannot be met for fi nancial or
other reasons, their implementation must be either staggered over a longer period
or postponed or in certain cases cancelled. This process must be absolutely
transparent to enable the MoD’s management, Czech Government and Parliament
to make well-informed decisions on building the individual elements of the Czech
Republic’s defence system.

4.9 Postponed or cancelled requirements always imply some risks for the country’s
security and defence capability. Therefore, defence planning is also an instrument
for identifying these risks and analysing their potential consequences. Since
there will always be a difference between the desired end state and reality, it is
inevitable to take a certain level of risk stemming from the inability to meet some
of the requirements. Defence planning helps politicians decide with respect to
the level of acceptability of the identifi ed risks.

4.10 The Ministry of Defence strives to reach a maximum level of transparency and
clarity of its defence policy. For this reason, it submits the Report on the Czech
Republic Defence to the Government on a yearly basis. This report evaluates
the state of defence, shows defi ciencies in capabilities, analyses their causes,
suggests corrective measures, and identifi es risks. The main conclusions and
recommendations of this report are available to the public.


-----

4.11 The MoD Planning Board is an advisory body established to provide advice
on strategic decisions within the defence planning process. The board ensures
integration and synchronisation of civilian and military aspects of the defence
planning process. It monitors the planning process in terms of achieving
objectives, identifi es risks and suggests ways to address them.

4.12 To support defence planning in general and activities of the MoD Planning
Board in particular, it is indispensable to create a functional, unifi ed and effi cient
information environment in the area under MoD’s responsibility.

###### Chapter 5

 Financial Framework and Management System

 Macroeconomic Perspective

5.1 The Czech Republic is a mid-sized country with an open market economy. In
relation to the development of the global economy there are signifi cant pros and
cons of such a dependency. This fact has become apparent especially during the
recent economic and fi nancial crisis that has had a negative impact on economic
growth in the Czech Republic.

5.2 The fi nancial crisis has negatively affected government fi nance. Due to the
slump, the government defi cit rose from 2.7 per cent of GDP in Fiscal Year
(FY) 2008 to 5.8 per cent in FY 2009, and subsequently the government
debt increased from 30 per cent GDP in FY 2008 to 35 per cent in FY 2009.
According to Excessive Defi cit Procedure, a set of across-the-board austerity
measures had to be executed, in order to prevent an excessive defi cit. There was
a considerable drawdown in defence spending; the 2010 MoD budget dropped
by more than seven billion CZK, in comparison with FY 2009, and the 2011 one
is by fi ve billion CZK lower, then the 2010 one.

5.3 Those cutbacks can be seen as the MoD’s sacrifi ce to stabilising the public
fi nance by the spirit of the Convergence Program of the Czech Republic
approved by the European Council. Nevertheless, any further reductions
in the military expenditure are unsustainable, especially with regard to the
missions assigned to the armed forces. Any rational planning is impractical
without a predicable, stable fi scal framework. On one hand, the curb of the
military spending might have brought instant savings; on the other hand,

an accumulative gap in military capabilities can be highly visible in mid-term.
Such an approach undercuts both the effort to achieve the political-military
ambitions, and the endeavour to maintain a reliable national defence. For this
reason, it ought to be highly desirable for political leaders to undertake the
responsibility to guarantee a long-term stability of defence expenditure.

5.4 The Czech Republic promotes deeper sharing of costs in the North Atlantic
Alliance, primarily through the strengthening of cooperation in the fi eld of
building und running of shared military capabilities, consolidation and creation
of common military capacity, and managing a closer collaboration in matters of
military training and education. At the same time, this course of action develops
pressure to accomplish the process of restructuring the Ministry of Defence in
accordance with the changes in the Czech geopolitical position after its joining
NATO (1999) and the European Union (2004).

###### Microeconomic Perspective

5.5 This part is focused on analysing the development of the basic fi nancial
indicators in the MoD budget areas during the last ten years, when the MoD
was striving to have a development-oriented budget. It means that expenditures
devoted to equipment and infrastructure should constitute approximately
20 per cent of the budget, expenditures devoted to personnel should not exceed
50 per cent of the budget, and expenditures devoted to other purposes are
around 30 per cent.

_As for the distribution of military expenditure, the Alliance recommends_
_allocating no more than 50% for expenditures devoted to personnel and_

5.6 This effort has not come to fruition, since FY 2006 the expenditures devoted
to personnel have kept growing, therefore the expenses on equipment and
infrastructure have been slowly falling. Such a development determinates the
sustainability of military capabilities. The distribution of military expenditures
has not been desirable. The following graph shows the distribution of the MoD
expenditures by category in implicit amounts.


-----

5.7 Thus, the structure of unexpected budget balances within the last ten fi scal
years indicates a high level of fl uctuation. The initial lower level of balances
in the period of 2001–2003 resulted from rigid budgetary law which has been
liberalised since 2004. However, this pool of money has shrunk back to the
2003 level and this fi nancial reserve has now run out.


-----

5.8 Based on the following graph, which shows the structure of expenditures spent on
the capability development, it is evident that these expenditures have substantially
decreased since 2005. The structure of investment resources has also changed
at the detriment of current expenditure associated with capital ones.

5.9 Due to the fi scal austerity, the number of personnel is slowly decreasing.
Both military personnel and civilian employees have been made redundant;
nonetheless, there is a more extensive turnover of civilian employees than
soldiers.

5.10 A slump in remuneration has taken place because of austerity measures; on the
contrary, due to reductions of military personnel, the retirement and separate
benefi ts are increasing.

5.11 Looking at the development of crucial running expenses in the last ten years, it
is apparent that the total expenses have not been radically changed; however,
a spike is evident in the FY 2011, FY 2012, and FY 2013. The structure of
budget items is signifi cantly changing – a signifi cant decrease is taking place
mainly in those items that are essential for operation and maintenance of military
capabilities, such as fuels, ammunition, clothing, and other stocks.


-----

5.12 The present book value of long-term tangible fi xed assets was kept
at a relatively stable level in the last decade. In FY 2009, this value increased by ca
9 billion CZK, primarily as a result of purchasing the Pandur armoured personnel
carriers (ca. 4.9 billion CZK), the CASA mid-distance transport airplanes (2.75
billion CZK), and light fi ghting vehicles (1.5 billion CZK). In FY 2011, the value of
long-term tangible fi xed assets will decrease (as a result of changed accounting
procedures) by the depreciation of it in the amount of ca 100 billion CZK.

5.13 The graph of the structure of long-term tangible assets illustrates a percentage
share by main types of these assets as of 31 December 2010. Together with
buildings and lands, separate movable items and sets of moveable items (they
include mainly aircraft and constructional components of airframes, vehicles,
communication and detection equipment), together with buildings and lands
cover the largest part. Since 2004, the stock level has shown a decreasing
tendency due to the disposal of excessive stocks, primarily ammunition.
Depending on the kind of stocks, these stocks are disposed of in environmentally
friendly way, selling off, possibly presented to local authorities, other ministries
and civil services. Undoubtedly, the problem rests in the structure and rate of
stock turnover.

###### Financial Management in an Austerity Era

5.14 Based on the microeconomic analysis, it is inevitable to reform the system of
control of the MoD and its management so as to run at maximum effectiveness.
Internal processes must be organized and controlled in a better way and
priorities must be selected more deliberately and reasonably. Therefore,
optimising the structure of expenditure and assets while searching for additional
fi nancial resources are highly necessary steps to be taken (e.g. deepening
of international cooperation, using the European Structural Funds, trying to
exclude key modernisation projects from the MoD budget, etc.) are the highly
needed steps to be taken.

5.15 The contemporary managerial approach is rather focused on inputs. A shift
from the traditional cash-based to an accrual-based accounting and budgeting
is needed in order to enhance economy, effi ciency, and effectiveness of
utilisation of inputs within armed forces. The heart of the matter lies in an
insuffi cient linkage to mid- and long-term planning Information on achieved
results, especially how they correspond with the formulated targets and their
indicators, is not available either.

5.16 Therefore, the reformed system of fi nancial management creates conditions
for economical, effective and suitable using of resources. Thus the system
must enable to record and evaluate all achievements and provide a managerial
feedback as to what was wrong and why set targets and objects cannot be
met. This also implies the necessity of getting a more compact system of
fi nancial management and command and control system. Nonetheless, such
a measure is conditioned by distinctly delimitated ministerial body’s power
on all management levels.

5.17 Social needs (public interest), which are formulated in the framework of
democratic political processes, are the starting point for setting defence
objectives. The requirements of society are regarded as a base for formulating
defence objectives and developing military capabilities.

5.18 In the budget-making process, clearly formulated objectives enable the
Ministry of Defence to defend its entitlements to fi nancial resources against
the executive and legislative bodies of the Czech Republic. At the same time,
such a system ensures transparency of public control over the use of public
funds allocated to defence. The current fi nancial management enables to
grant funds for all organizational elements of armed forces and to fund them,
but its ability to enforce economy, effi ciency, and effectiveness of their use is
rather disputable.


-----

5.19 The success in transforming fi nancial management in the Ministry of Defence
and the Czech Armed Forces is determined by changes in other parts of the
management system (command and control, defence planning, building-up
and transformation of organizational structures, personnel management). The
desired integration and consolidation in the management system is not feasible
without the implementation of the long-term defence capability planning. The
necessary steps have been taken already.

5.20 In order to be more progressive in the area of fi nancial management, it is
advisable to integrate plans, control current assets more effectively, and pay
closer attention to the process of capital maintenance and procurement. Cost
control is the prerequisite for an introduction of controlling.

5.21 Management is supported by a compact management information system,
reporting systems, outputs of accounting, internal fi nancial statistics, and
fi nancial analyses. This information is available for all command and control
levels on the need-to-know principle. This information support is an integral
part of the MoD management and it is compatible with the Treasury.

5.22 Neither real planning nor achieving individual objectives in effective ways
is possible without reliable economic information and convenient methods.
For this purpose, Performance-Oriented Budgeting is being implemented.
Its implementation does lead to an outright cost control of cost centres, i.e.
organizational elements of armed forces and the MoD.

5.23 The MoD budget size is also predetermined by requirements for covering large
modernisation and development projects in the period from 2012 to 2020. All
of these projects are unlikely to be executed in the era of national austerity
budget.

5.24 The unsystematic postponement of modernisation and development projects
in the past has resulted in accumulating an enormous defi cit which exceeds
80–90 billion CZK by conservative estimate. This estimate is based on the
Mid-Term Plans drew up by the Ministry of Defence biannually since fi scal
year 2004. In light of the fact that these plans call for funds to be allocated
to training of the armed forces, maintaining of stocks of ammunition, fuels
and military accoutrement as well as the modernisation and procurement


-----

of weapon and technical systems, the gap is to determine the difference
between the planned target-state and investments made so far, resulting in
the aforementioned defi cit.

5.25 The Ministry of Defence draws a mid-term plan and an annual budget
focused on objectives containing of a quantifi cation cost and benefi ts related
to national defence. Each authorised user of these documents, such as
members of Parliament, members of government, ministerial offi cials, military
establishment, etc. can fi nd out in these documents the costs and benefi ts of
each organizational part of the armed forces and the Ministry of Defence are
their link to the objectives of national security and military policy.

5.26 The performance audit is a necessary criterion for drawing up a high-quality
budget and plan. Personnel who are assigned for this job ought to be skilled
and have undergone an adequate training as well be provided with appropriate
methodology to carry out such an audit.

5.27 The Ministry of Defence together with the armed forces will fulfi l tasks properly
provided there is stable funding. Nevertheless, the public fi nance has not been
able to give the defence budget such a stability so far due to too short of an
outlook. There is a guarantee of stable funding within two fi scal years following
the current fi scal year only. It is imperative to extend this term at least by two
additional years and to draw up the fi nancial outlook on a sliding-scale basis
and in a prescribed form by fi scal law. The funds allocated to defence should
not be given as percentage of GDP but as an absolute fi gure.

###### Chapter 6

 Competent and Motivated People

 People are the Priority

6.1 People are regarded as the top value and key factor for attaining the required
capabilities of the armed forces and other organizations in the area of responsibility
of the Czech Republic’s MoD. The highest priority is given to recruitment, education,
and training of high-quality military and civilian personnel. The Ministry of Defence
must be viewed as a responsible, reliable and attractive employer capable of
successful competition in the labour market.

6.2 This is not an easy task. According to the 2007 document Transformation of
the Czech Ministry of Defence Sector, the total number of personnel planned
for the end of 2010 was supposed to be 36,800 (26,200 soldiers, 8,800 civilian
employees, and 1,800 trainees). In reality, as of 1 January 2011, the MoD sector
recorded 21,309 soldiers, 8,011 civilians and 937 trainees). The reason why the
target cannot be achieved lies in insuffi cient budget allocations. In the future, this
factor will also be reinforced by other negative trends such as demographics.

6.3 The number of people in the age category that is most suitable for recruitment for
the armed forces (18 to 25 years of age) will diminish during the next ten years.
At the same time, those who entered the military in the 1990s will terminate their
active service. Hence, it is going to be a challenge to keep a positive balance
between growth and attrition and to prevent the armed forces from ageing.

6.4 A consequence of the ageing trend and its further deepening can lead to higher
expenses in health care, preventive rehabilitation and salaries.


-----

6.5 This is also a reason why past debts accumulated in the fi eld of building the
fundamental rank categories of troops and non-commissioned offi cers, the system
of personnel career management, salary policy and other issues must be solved
as soon as possible. The system and processes of personnel management must
be adjusted to requirements for the development of the Czech Armed Forces.
Specifi cally, the number of senior offi cers and generals must be adjusted to the
size and missions of the armed forces.

###### Personnel Management

6.6 Personnel management1 (PM) concentrates on recruiting both military and
civilian personnel, their retention in active service or employment contract,
constant creation of conditions for their individual and professional development,
and their functioning. This stems from principles enabling the personnel to
achieve a higher level of general education, professional qualifi cation and civic
mindedness. Furthermore, its process is based on an effective application of
acquired knowledge, experience and practical skills in which the principles of
equal opportunities are fully implemented.

6.7 Personnel management helps to create optimised social conditions for soldiers
as well as civilian employees, both during their active service or employment
contract and after its expiration. Through service in the armed forces, all
personnel are enriched with an added value, i.e. new skills usable in the labour
market.

6.8 From the procedural and organizational point of view, the system of personnel
management stands on three main pillars (subsystems): conceptual, executive
and supportive.

**The MoD System of Personnel Management**

**Conceptual Subsystem**
_(PM regulations, preparation of bills_
_etc.)_

**Executive Subsystem** **Subsystem of Personnel**
_(administrative implementation of PM_ **Support to Commanders**
_decisions and personnel support)_ _(preparation of PM decisions)_

6.9 Personnel management is based on the principle of centralising the conceptual and
methodical management and on transparency. Commanders and other managers
participate in personnel management by selecting and appointing personnel at
individual positions within their scope of authority.

6.10 Soldiers are the core of the armed forces personnel and all are fully deployable
on military operations. In some cases, civilian employees can also be sent to
military operations to accomplish supporting missions. The Active Reserve Force
is a part of the armed forces with a special status. Soldiers are not assigned to
positions and activities that may be occupied or performed by civilians.

1 Personnel management is a complex managerial approach to working with people and the development
of their personal and professional potential for the benefi t of the MoD organizations. In this regard,
implementing measures of personnel management falls under the responsibility of commanders and
other managers who use a broad spectrum of management tools including personnel service agencies
for this purpose.


-----

6.11 During their active service and employment contract, both soldiers and civilian
employees go through personal and professional development through
education, training, practical activities and career paths (individual effort for
advancement in ranks and positions). They are motivated not only by the
progress in their career (and in the rank hierarchy among soldiers), but also by
the income and social policy based on performance criteria. A soldier’s career
and professional growth of civilian employees is regulated by specifi c rules that
are applied to conditions for purposefully developing organizational culture.

6.12 All superiors, including those at the lowest levels of command and control, must
be engaged in the process of career development. Nevertheless, each soldier
or civilian employee is responsible for their own career progress.

6.13 Upon entering active service, soldiers voluntarily renounce some of the rights
that Czech citizens are guaranteed by the constitutional laws. Therefore, they
are entitled to material, fi nancial and social compensations throughout and even
after the period of their active service.

6.14 Particular attention shall be paid to the military personnel who have been wounded
during their active service or have suffered mental disorders as a consequence of
their deployment. A system of psychological help has been established for them
and their next of kin, and special care is dedicated to the families of those soldiers
who lost their life during service.

6.15 The implementation of objectives of personnel management enables the
following:

� creating conditions for shaping individual categories of personnel, especially
rank categories and their development;
� improving career management of military personnel in the course of their
active service as well as stabilising and motivating civilian employees
throughout the duration of their employment contract;
� regain competitive ability on the labour market;
� building a comprehensive system of education and training of military
personnel closely linked with the system of career management;
� rationalisation of training and educational facilities and using, in a broader
scope, other capacities both in the Czech Republic and abroad;
� implementing a system of education that will lead to shaping ethical and
professional qualities of individuals to meet the criteria for a member of
democratic country’s armed forces;
� developing a welfare system for soldiers both during and after active
service;
� promoting the care for war veterans
� facilitating military personnel integration into civilian life after active service.

###### Career Management

6.16 Career Code is based on pertinent legal provisions, specifi es conditions
for career development and respects the declared principles for building
professional armed forces. It sets conditions for admitting people into active
service, preparing personnel for their military duties, promoting to higher ranks,
assigning to systemized positions, raising qualifi cations, and also for terminating
military career.

6.17 Career Code consists of a set of enforceable rules for a centralized, transparent,
competitive and selective process of military promotion. It is primarily focused


-----

on individual qualities of soldiers, their will and effort to develop individual and
professional skills, and ambitions for being promoted in ranks.

6.18 The Czech Armed Forces personnel are divided into six rank categories.

**Trainees & Troops**

This category consists of soldiers in basic training and at elementary positions in military units who carry
out all manual activities, as ordered by their superiors.

**Non/Commissioned Offi cers**

This is the fundamental rank category in the armed forces and inter-stage between the categories of
recruits and warrant offi cers in a career path. It includes soldiers assigned to military positions in weapon
systems and other equipment, logistic and other positions, primarily requiring manual skills. The key
mission of this category of personnel lies in commanding activities at the lowest organizational level
(fl ight, station, crew, system, workshop, squad) and executing their training duties if assigned to a basic
instructor’s position. Their role is irreplaceable mainly in an operational deployment of the armed forces.

**Warrant Offi cers**

The category of warrant offi cers is the career peak for military personnel other than offi cers. Warrant
offi cers implement middle-level management in units, staffs and logistic facilities and act as specialists on
weapon, communication and other systems. The key missions accomplished by personnel of this category
are middle-level command and leadership (deputy platoon leaders, Company Sergeants or Command
Sergeants Major) and training if assigned to a higher instructor’s position. Warrant offi cers may be
appointed to posts at higher-level staffs. Independence, initiative, applying learned knowledge and lessons,
and responsibility are the main attributes in their activities.

**Junior Offi cers**

As an elementary part of the two categories of offi cers, junior offi cers, together with warrant offi cers,
execute middle-level management in units, staffs and logistic facilities. However, in contrast with
warrant offi cers, this category is not built on the principle of seniority, but on the foundations of
personality and profi ciency development that are needed for a potentiality of being selected for the
category of senior offi cers. Junior offi cers are responsible for accepting competent decisions having an
infl uence on activities of units at a company level and their equivalents.

**Senior Offi cers**

These personnel are selected from the category of junior offi cers and represent a higher level of
management. Both as commanders responsible for designated areas and offi cials at higher-level staffs,
they make decisions on issues that have an impact on military units and facilities, their groups or entire
segments of the armed forces within the MoD’s scope of authorities. The best captains, who have
already proven the required abilities to occupy a senior offi cer position, are selected for this category.
A special position among senior offi cers is held by soldiers in the rank of colonel who always assume the
highest commanding posts within those segments of the armed forces that are subordinate to the Chief
of General Staff, Minister of Defence and President of the Czech Republic.

**Generals**

Generals belong to military establishment and they are a part of the elite of the Czech Republic and are
responsible for making strategic and operational decisions having an infl uence on the entire or a part of
the Czech Armed Forces. Mature personalities who have proven their eligibility by achieving outstanding
results are selected for this category. At the same time, they are soldiers who are able to gain, through
their moral qualities, educational background and a broad social horizon, the public trust, and thus help
the armed forces build a good reputation.

6.19 Pursuant to effective rules and regulations as stipulated for each rank category,
soldiers perform their military service in the interest of the Czech Republic’s
defence in the homeland and abroad with the understanding that their active
duty status is limited in time. Time periods for staying at each rank are limited
as well.


-----

6.20 The Soldier’s Plan of Personal Development forms the basis of career
management. It is administered by the soldiers’ direct supervisors on the basis

of an objective evaluation of their performance and potential and in accordance
with the requirements of the Czech Armed Forces.

6.21 A commanding career is the cornerstone in the armed forces and is characterised
by a career path to which an individual not only alternately occupies command,
staff and pedagogical jobs, but is also engaged in various activities abroad
and deployed on military operations. Career management of soldiers in scarce
specialised positions or special branches or services, primarily in the rank
category of warrant offi cers, the main career path is adjusted to their specifi c

features.

6.22 Career progress of senior offi cers and generals is expected regardless of their
original specialty. In addition to their professional education, these individuals
must also display corresponding managerial and personality qualifi cations.

6.23 Soldiers may be assigned to a position of the same or higher military rank within
the framework of their career’s progress. Appointing soldiers during their active
service to a systemized position of a lower military rank is impermissible, even
if based on voluntary consent. In case a systemised position specifi es a higher
rank, assigning a soldier to such a position is tied with their promotion to the
corresponding military rank.

6.24 In the network of career paths, each position has its own minimum and
maximum periods to be occupied by one person. Occupation periods specifi ed
for commanding positions shall not be prolonged. As for positions pertaining to
unique experts or scarce specialties, their occupation periods may be extended
if such a measure is for the benefi t of the armed forces.

6.25 Career progress is determined by a person’s performance evaluation in
a hitherto occupied position and their success in the selection process. The
necessary requirement for being appointed to a new position rests in meeting
specifi ed criteria such as achieving required eligibilities, military and specialised
qualifi cations, time in a military rank (systemised position), and participation in
military operations. In terms of assignments to the lower positions, individual
abilities and experience are prioritised over education required for such a post.

6.26 The armed forces and the soldier conclude a contract, which specifi es the time
period of active duty and other associated conditions. The status of active duty
will be terminated for those soldiers who use up their potential for further career
development, refuse to continue in military service or cease to meet criteria, as
stipulated by legal provisions for active duty.


-----

###### Preparation of Personnel

6.27 The process of preparing personnel consists of a comprehensive system of
education, training and personality development and is thoroughly tied to career
management.

6.28 The system of individual personnel preparation is based on a complex of lifelong
education that is composed of accredited education and professional training; the
latter is implemented through the system of career and specialised courses.

###### Personnel Preparation Components

Pramen: MO ČR

6.29 The process of interconnecting personnel preparation with career management
enables soldiers to prepare for their future appointments. While occupying their
specifi c systemised position, soldiers have an opportunity to prepare themselves
for another systemised position to which they may be assigned after the specifi ed
qualifi cation criteria are met.

6.30 The military system of personnel preparation is permeable and compatible with
other educational systems of the Czech Republic, the NATO and the EU.

6.31 As for selected fi elds and specialisations, soldiers are prepared in civilian
facilities, both in the Czech Republic and abroad, wherever it is more suitable or
cost effective.

6.32 The Ministry of Defence systematically promotes the attractiveness of its
educational and training facilities for foreign students, primarily from the allied and
partner countries.


-----

6.33 The individual preparation of personnel is procedurally and methodically under
central control, as required by the armed forces. The centralisation enables
systematic linkages between individual preparation in military schools and
career management.

6.34 The Ministry of Defence has its own educational capacities for high school
and university study programmes. These capacities meet the requirements for
recruitment, are directly linked to desired capabilities of the armed forces, and
also reach maximum effectiveness.

6.35 In relation to the changes in the system of military education, the legal status
of student-trainees and terms and conditions pertaining to their salaries and
material benefi ts have been adjusted to raise motivation for education and
subsequently service in the armed forces.

6.36 In the system of personnel management, the high school carries out three
functions. First, it is designed for direct recruitment in technical specialties or
preparing candidates for their enrolment in universities. Second, the school
provides a specialised high school education concluded with an exit examination
(baccalaureate) to perspective recruits and
sergeants; this is the criterion for their further _The individual_

organizations; it also enables representatives of public administration and other
applicants to use its capacities. Second, the university also runs both post-graduate
and life-long education. Third, it offers qualifi cation courses for offi cers. Finally, it
develops military science.


6.38 The university prepares junior offi cers in such numbers, programmes and fi elds
as required by the armed forces and in line with their economic potential. Its
graduates are assigned to commanding and specialised positions for which they
have to be well prepared. Therefore, they study not only military science and
a military specialisation, but also history, law, political science, ethics, sociology,
psychology and other humanities.


-----

6.39 The process of connecting theory with practice enables the offi cers who have
gathered valuable lessons learned from their command, staff and military
operation positions to participate in the university curricula, as a part of their
career development.

6.40 The university offers a higher-level of specialised military education, mainly in
the form of career and professional courses designed for senior offi cers. Its
specialised institutes are engaged in research activities in specifi c fi elds of
military science.

6.41 Prior to being assigned to individual positions, graduates from the university
must go through specialised training in the Military Academy. Those selected
to assume command positions are sent to an internship in military units to
acquire practical experience and learn valuable lessons from experienced
commanders.

6.42 Following the approval of the White Paper, the Ministry of Defence will develop
the concept for preparing and educating military personnel, where functions and
objectives of the capacities for education will be detailed together with methods
of their effective implementation.

6.43 The Military Academy is a facility of key importance which provides unaccredited
forms of education and individual training to NCOs, warrant offi cers and junior
offi cers. It also fulfi ls the requirements from all the components of the Czech
Armed Forces for career and specialised courses. In addition, this centre opens
various courses for the allies, partners,
international organizations and other entities.

specialised training.

6.44 Instructors play a critical role in training. They are selected from the most
outstanding and experienced non-commissioned and warrant offi cers of military
units, branches, services and specialists on weapon, communication and
information systems. In the course of performing their temporary instructor duty,
they receive special motivational benefi ts.


-----

6.45 At the recommendation of the General Staff, the content of curricula in the
system of education and training has been changed to satisfy the needs of
the armed forces for long-term sustainability of capabilities. In addition, some
organizational structures have been adjusted in order to promote the process of
vacating selected facilities and integrating logistical support.

6.46 In reference to developing operational capabilities, the Czech Armed Forces
will review the current training and educational activities with a view to redefi ne
implementation methods (i.e. either in the Czech MoD’s facilities or through
purchases from other national and international sources). This process will
result in specifying which activities shall be run by the MoD’s capacities and
which should be outsourced.

6.47 The system of language education is under unifi ed control in all language
institutes as well as within the entire structure of personnel career development.
Language education emphasizes English and permeates in a differentiated
manner to all the rank categories. Meeting language profi ciency criteria is
a necessary requirement for promoting a person to the rank of offi cer and direct
recruitment of junior offi cers. Senior offi cers and generals have to have achieve
SLP 3333[2] level of language profi ciency.

6.48 As for individual preparation, emphasis is put on the willingness and ambitions
of an individual soldier or civilian employee to educate themselves, primarily
in the form of self-improvement. Methods of distance learning are used
more extensively. A motivational factor supporting the professional growth of
specialists is seen in an introduction of classes, certifi cations and attestations.

6.49 The MoD civilian personnel are prepared in the system of life-long education,
similarly as staff in other administrative bodies.

###### Salary and Welfare Policy

6.50 The system of remunerating soldiers supports their vertical and horizontal
career movements in the structure of the armed forces. This measure shall
guarantee their individual as well as professional growth and also provides
fl exibility to react to changing needs and requirements. In line with the Czech
Government’s statement of policy[3], the Ministry of Defence strives to preserve
the income level of the personnel of the Czech Armed Forces.

-----

6.51 A soldier’s salary consists of two components – basic and motivational, the
latter being an expression of appreciation of a soldier’s initiative, efforts and
precision in executing his or her duties. In justifi ed cases, some soldiers may
receive an additional pay supplement for attractiveness of their specialty in the
labour market and compensation for education covered at their own expense,
which will be applied in their further appointments.

6.52 The amount of the soldiers’ basic salary corresponds to the demands of
their service and is tied to their appointed rank and position. Thanks to this
measure, soldiers holding a higher rank and occupying a higher position do
not receive a lower salary than those in lower positions and ranks. The work in
specialist positions and functions that does not allow for rise through the ranks
is remunerated by the principle of assessing the growth in expertise.


-----

6.53 The motivational component of salary consists of three parts: the fi rst is an
expression of a long-term level of executing professional duties, the second
refl ects demands and responsibilities of active service, and the third is composed
of lump sum bonuses paid after accomplishing crucial or extraordinary tasks or
performing outstanding deeds. Transparent rules have been specifi ed for each
part of the motivational component.

6.54 Civilian personnel are remunerated by applying the principles effective in public
administration.

6.55 Soldiers who terminated their active service under exactly specifi ed conditions
are entitled for military retirement allowance. Retirement allowance serves as
a motivational stimulus for joining the armed forces and encouraging individual
growth and longevity of active duty. At the same time, this is an instrument
to ensure an appropriate social standard after entering civilian life and an
expression of social compensation for being restrained on individual rights and
freedoms during their active duty.

6.56 More attention is paid to programmes that support families of those personnel
who are deployed on operations outside Czech territory, develop infrastructure
in military garrisons, improve working conditions at worksites, provide medical
care for war veterans and military pensioners, and run recreational sport and
cultural activities. A comprehensive psychological service and chaplaincy are
important attributes of such care for personnel.

6.57 The soldiers are fi nancially compensated for their duty to be stationed in
locations as required by the armed forces, such as for housing and commuteassociated expenses if separated from their families. Upon request, the Ministry
of Defence provides paid lodging to soldiers.

6.58 War veterans, especially those who were directly engaged in international military
operations, risked their life in perilous locations. As an expression of gratitude
and respect from society, they have been granted social and other benefi ts
ensuring a dignifi ed life. In addition, other entities of the public administration
are involved, to a large extent, in care for war veterans.

###### Chapter 7

 Development of Capabilities

 7.1 Political-Military Ambitions and Capabilities

7.1.1 This chapter presents the complete package of the capabilities of the Czech
Armed Forces that are indispensable for ensuring national defence, attaining
the declared political-military ambitions of the Czech Republic[1] and fulfi lling the
roles and functions[2] of its armed forces. It describes a desired state that differs
from reality, primarily for the following three reasons.

7.1.2 First, ambition is a desired target state that covers a long period. In this sense
and in accordance with current plans, the full operational capability of the armed
forces shall be achieved by 2018.

7.1.3 Second, regarding the current budgetary situation and its future outlook, the
Ministry of Defence is now standing at a crossroads. If the organizational
and structural changes recommended by the _White Paper that target an_
accumulation of savings from the optimization process are carried out, and
at the same time the defence budget starts increasing in the following years,
the declared ambitions may again become feasible. However, if the trend of
repeated cuts and unfounded interventions into defence planning seen over the
last decade is not reversed, fulfi lment of political-military ambitions will again be
delayed. The worst-case scenario suggests they will have to be reduced, which
is inevitably going to result in losing some capabilities.

1 See Chapter 1 – Points of Departure

2 See Chapter 3 – Roles and Functions of the Czech Armed Forces


-----

7.1.4 Third, this unfavourable trend deepens the growing defi cit even further. As
highlighted in this chapter, this situation is a consequence of postponing or
delaying the development of many capabilities listed in this chapter, such as
delayed repairs, delayed weapon systems and infrastructure modernisation
projects and insuffi cient investments into soldiers’ equipment, training and
professional development. By a sensible estimate, the defi cit has already
reached a level of approximately two current annual defence budgets.

7.1.5 For over 20 years, the Czech Armed Forces have been built and managed
to operate on the principles of civilian management and democratic control.
Thus, setting missions and allocating budget limits are not done by soldiers,
but by political representatives who are responsible for creating conditions to
enable the armed forces to appropriately ensure the security and defence of the
Czech Republic. Delaying or even cancelling a military capability is unavoidably
associated with increasing the risk for the Czech defence and security of its
citizens. Hence, it is a political issue and thereby a duty of the Czech Republic’s
political offi cials to choose the degree of risk and political responsibility for the
future defi cit in defence capabilities.

###### 7.2 The Armed Forces from the Capabilities Perspective

7.2.1 Capabilities express the ability of the armed forces to operate effectively
in crisis situations and war confl icts. They are determined by a suffi cient
quantity of well-prepared personnel, appropriate organizational structure,
advanced armament and equipment, suffi cient supplies, level of training and
comprehensive support and service. An organizational element (unit/facility)
is regarded as their implementing instrument, whether as a group of or a mere
part of the element (units).

7.2.2 The DOTMLPFI3 concept is applied in NATO defence planning and is used
for developing and evaluating capabilities. It enables to view capabilities as
a complex of mutually interconnected parts.

7.2.3 The necessary spectrum of the armed forces capabilities results from
designated roles and functions of the armed forces within the security system
of the Czech Republic, declared international commitments, political-military
ambitions and scenarios for using the armed forces.

3 DOTMLPFI is an acronym that stands for Doctrines, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership,
Personnel, Facilities and Interoperability. It is a standard method of analyzing individual segments of
capabilities used in NATO defence planning which enables their qualitative and quantitative evaluation.


-----

###### 7.3 Starting Points for Capability-Based Planning

7.3.1 Defence of the Czech Republic’s territory is guaranteed within the framework
of the NATO system of collective defence based on Article 5 of the Washington
Treaty. Within this framework, the Czech Armed Forces operate in a defensive
formation of the Alliance and, in accordance with Article 3 of the Washington
Treaty, they “separately and jointly, by means of continuous and effective selfhelp and mutual aid, will maintain and develop their individual and collective
capacity to resist armed attack”. In case of a separate deployment, the Czech
Armed Forces are prepared to accomplish missions related to protection of
the state border or property on the Czech territory and assistance within the
Integrated Rescue System and to the Police of the Czech Republic to preserve
public order and national security. In international operations, they function
solely as a part of international task forces, primarily on the basis of organic
units that are able to be replenished by specifi c modules if needed.

7.3.2 The Czech Republic participates in the development of NATO/EU strategic
capabilities and is engaged in the project of their sharing. It generates

capabilities of its own armed forces according to NATO/EU priorities and
standards for defence planning, primarily in compliance with the NATO Force
Goals programme.

7.3.3 Through regular participation in the NATO Response Force (NRF) and EU
Battle Groups (EU BG), the Czech Armed Forces improve their own quality
and interoperability. In the interest of ensuring regular engagement in these
combat task forces, the cost connected with their contingent deployment and
sustainment is covered from resources outside the MoD budget.

7.3.4 Joining the shared security projects running in the framework of international
organizations is often the only possibility of achieving complex and costly
capabilities. At the same time, it is an expression of solidarity and willingness
to participate in burden-sharing.

7.3.5 Activities of key importance to the Czech Republic include:

� participation in international military structures, agencies of international
organizations and projects for building critical infrastructure to fulfi l the
Alliance’s goals, and sharing activities with allied corps;
� participation in international initiatives to raise the effectiveness of the armed
forces deployed in operations;
� engagement in building capabilities to be able to face new challenges and
threats. This category also includes a contribution to defence and protection
against weapons of mass destruction and their carriers;
� assistance in transformation efforts, including development of relations with
partner nations.

7.3.6 The Czech Republic naturally cooperates with its neighbouring countries;
individual projects are also open to other states. Thus, they have to be based on
the principles of mutual advantage and balanced sharing of costs and returns.

7.3.7 Among the countries in the Central European region, the Czech Republic is
historically and culturally closest to Slovakia, which naturally increases the
potential for cooperation. The most suitable fi elds for joint projects include
education and training, logistics, medical service, and air defence.

7.3.8 Within the framework of the IRS, the Czech Armed Forces render available
forces and equipment for rescue activities in case of disasters and other
serious emergencies, and for clearing their aftermath, inclusive of reinforcing
the Czech Police.

7.3.9 The armed forces are also ready to accomplish other missions concerning
humanitarian assistance, air-lifts, air medical transport, ensuring signifi cant
activities and events in the Czech Republic, and others, if need.


-----

7.3.10 Within NATO and EU defence planning, the Czech Republic declares the
defence against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN)
weapons as its specialization. The Joint CBRN Defence Centre of Excellence
in Vyškov, certifi ed by the Alliance, is a part of this capability.

###### 7.4 Characteristics of the Environment for the Deployment of the Armed Forces

7.4.1 The central mission of the Czech Armed Forces lies in defending the country’s
territory against an external attack in the framework of NATO collective defence.
To achieve this objective, the armed forces prepare both individually and
collectively with their allies and partners in the Czech Republic and abroad.

7.4.2 During the last twenty years, the Czech Armed Forces have been deployed
on operations taking place both outside and inside the Czech Republic. In the
latter case, they have cooperated with the Czech Police or IRS primarily in
clearing the aftermath of natural disasters and industrial accidents. Forces
have been operating in diverse and changing environments.

7.4.3 The armed forces deployed abroad must be prepared for an operational
environment where no homogenous theatre exists. Differences between
combat and non-combat zones will often disappear and reliance on logistic
support from the country where forces are deployed is not possible. Soldiers
may operate in an environment characterized by signifi cant cultural differences.
Their adversary may have regular as well as irregular forces, often with no
central command and using asymmetric capabilities in an environment they
know very well.

7.4.4 The expected character of operations calls for deploying smaller units capable
of maintaining a high operational tempo and minimising logistical demands.
Their effectiveness is increased by reduction of numbers and unifi cation of the
types of armament; equipment is highly reliable and economical; command
and control systems are effective and supported by appropriate technologies
for gathering information by using sensors, processing, distributing and
sharing information in real time throughout the entire spectrum of forces. They
operate in the system of Network Enabled Capability (NEC) with a high level of
cybernetic protection and interoperability with the allied systems.

7.4.5 Lessons learned from international missions are also used for augmenting the quality
of the armed force’s preparation for collective defence of the Czech territory.

7.4.6 A complex nature of operations necessitates coordination between military and
civilian capabilities. The missions in the Balkans and the work of the Provincial

Reconstruction Team in Logar, Afghanistan serve both as an example of and
a source of lessons learned for cooperation between soldiers and civilians.

7.4.7 Cooperation among bodies across the entire spectrum of national
administration and local government has intensifi ed as a result of the
complex nature of the current security environment. At the national level
and in the context of Czech engagement abroad, deeper cooperation has
been achieved in preparing and sending experts from civilian entities and
the Czech Police to areas of operation to participate in reconstruction
activities and accomplish training/mentoring missions for the sake of local
security forces.

7.4.8 It is necessary to create a national list of experts who will undergo
appropriate training and be sent abroad if necessary. The training must
take into consideration both civilian and military lessons learned from
operations.

7.4.9 The preparation of national civilian experts is carried out in cooperation with
other ministries and through a variety of activities (survival courses, military
planning, rules of engagement, etc.).

7.4.10 Effi cient cooperation among central administrative offi ces is essential for
coordinating international and security policy as well as formulating approaches
to key missions such as cybernetic protection, comprehensive crisis response
or counter-terrorism measures.

7.4.11 In an armed confl ict, coordinated
cooperation between the Czech _It is necessary to make_

fundamental principles that the
organizations follow (i.e. impartiality,
independence and neutrality in case of non-governmental organizations)
and knowing their missions, mandates and capacities.

7.4.12 Adequate training of experts at a national level and engagement in
multinational projects is essential for accomplishing operational missions and
running effective cooperation among the Czech Armed Forces, governmental,
non-governmental as well as international organizations. In the long-term, the
following activities shall be supported:

� building awareness of different attitudes to responding to crisis situations by
various actors and the necessity of their mutual cooperation;


-----

� sharing information on crisis and confl ict areas. Bearing in mind that the
emergence of crises is an unpredictable factor, this capability must be
institutionalised, continuous and inclusive of external experts (outside the
public administration), such as members of the academia and security
communities;
� collection, evaluation and sharing of lessons learned from activities by
civilian and military components in responding to crisis situations both in the
Czech Republic and abroad, and their application in personnel training;
� capability development of CIMIC (Civil-Military Cooperation) units.

7.4.13 Since the mid-1990s, thousands of the Czech Armed Forces personnel
have been deployed to deal with natural disasters and epidemics, as well as
sudden local fl oods, mass diseases affl icting livestock or snow calamities.
Providing help to citizens in the territory of the Czech Republic is a mission
of great importance, especially for the Czech Armed Forces and the Active
Reserve Force.

7.4.14 Consequences of potential large-scale industrial accidents or terrorist attacks
on facilities, industrial plants and other infrastructures also present security
risks. An accident or attack may cause chemical, biological or radiation threats.
In case of such emergencies, the armed forces are ready to assist the IRS or
the Czech Police.

###### 7.5 Modular Subdivision of the Armed Forces Capabilities

7.5.1 The Czech Armed Forces are divided into Army (Land Forces) and Air Force.
However, the authors of the White Paper prefer using a process-based model
to explain the interrelationship among individual types of capabilities. In terms
of types of operational deployments, the Czech Republic Armed Forces consist
of combat, combat support and combat service support units, further explained
below:

� Combat units are capable of conducting fi ghting activities in contact with an
enemy;
� Combat support units render direct support to combat units in an area of
operations by providing reconnaissance, communication and engineer
capacities, fi re support, etc.;
� Combat service support units provide administrative, logistic and technical
services to ensure that the combat and combat support units are adequately
manned, armed, supplied with food, fuel, and other materials and services.

###### 7.6 Combat Units

7.6.1 The Land Forces combat units are characterized by high mobility, fi repower
and deployability throughout the entire spectrum of operational intensity. They
achieve required effects through proper use of combinations of mechanized,
airborne, armoured and light motorized units. Their fi repower is based on
precision target destruction systems employed on the battlefi eld. Soldiers
use modular combat equipment that is integrated into the digital battlefi eld to
enable them to receive data they need to conduct combat activities.

7.6.2 The Land Forces combat units are trained principally for being deployed in
international operations, especially as a part of NATO/EU and other ad hoc
coalitions. Therefore, their training is focused on achieving a maximum level of
interoperability and is adapted to meet this objective.

7.6.3 The Land Forces combat units are the main pillar of the Czech Armed Forces
formations engaged in international operations. They are prepared for both
combat missions and non-combat operations (e.g. humanitarian).

7.6.4 The organizational structure of the combat units and their equipment support
their tasks. As a result, the units can generate task forces capable of functioning
throughout the whole spectrum of operations ranging from high-intensity
combat operations (armoured and mechanized units) to peace support and
humanitarian operations (light motorized units).

7.6.5 Combat units also include **special forces acting independently, jointly or in**
coordination with other forces throughout the entire operational spectrum. They
conduct inconspicuous/discreet, covert or secret operations, seek and gather
information to support tactical and strategic decision-making, achieve precise
effects through direct and indirect actions through the use of kinetic as well
as non-kinetic instruments, operate on land and water and carry out airborne
landings. To accomplish these missions, they are equipped with tactical rotary
and fi xed-wing aircraft.

7.6.6 Special forces are composed of the Special Forces Group and their superior
command element for conducting special operations. In addition, parts of other
forces, both land and air, have been earmarked to support special forces in their
operations as required.

7.6.7 Command and control over special operations, training of special forces,
doctrinal aspects, and development of required capabilities are under central
control of the above-mentioned command element for conducting special
operations. Similarly, centralized control has been instituted for the development
of specifi c capabilities that are needed to support special operations conducted


-----

by designated regular forces. This approach guarantees development of
capabilities which are necessary for executing special operations, and in
parallel, increase the level of modularity and deployability of the armed forces
in a rapidly evolving and complex environment.

7.6.8 Due to the strategic signifi cance and impact of special operations, the process
of tasking the command and control of special forces comes directly down the
line from the highest political-military level with a minimum number of interstages.


7.6.9 The Air Force combat components are capable of conducting both day-time and
night-time combat operations, and even under deteriorated climatic conditions.
Their main mission rests in protecting Czech airspace in the framework of
both the NATO Integrated Air Defence System (NATINADS) and National
Reinforcement System, including activities associated with the RENEGATE
antiterrorist concept[4].

7.6.10 In light of protecting the Czech Republic from a potential attack, prevention
and intimidation are the prime functions of the NATINADS system. Through
an active participation in this system, which is one of the main pillars of
Czech defence within NATO, the Czech Republic contributes to developing
collective defence of the Alliance. To achieve this objective, the capability of
the supersonic-based Tactical Air Force is indispensable.

-----

7.6.11 If the intensity and scope of its training is enhanced and adequate armament
and communication technologies are added, the Air Force will also be capable
of completing missions focused on offensive air operations.

7.6.12 Czech Air Force combat units also participate in international operations outside
Czech territory in the framework of international air task forces. However, the
type of mission to be assigned to them depends on their level of readiness and
equipment.

7.6.13 Training of Air Force components is primarily aimed at fulfi lling the so-called
Defensive Counter-Air (DCA) missions (i.e. stopping and destroying enemy
forces attempting to attack or penetrate Czech airspace). Both fl ying and
ground personnel of the Air Force combat elements are prepared primarily for
missions to be fulfi lled as part of international air task forces in accordance
with the Alliance’s operational requirements.

7.6.14 Forward Air Controllers (FAC) are earmarked personnel of the Air Force who
cooperate with land units and provide guidance to Close Air Support (CAS)
aircraft to hit the intended target.

###### 7.7 Combat Support Units

7.7.1 Combat Support consists of various capabilities, such as military intelligence,
surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic warfare, air support, ground-based air
defence, fi re support, CBRN defence, combat engineer support, information and
psychological operations, and civil-military cooperation.

7.7.2 Czech Armed Forces are supported by an effi cient system of ISR5 and
electronic warfare, including the capabilities of classifi ed transfer and sharing
of intelligence information, updating the database of lessons-learned and
electronic warfare countermeasures.

7.7.3 **Military intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance use components of**
combat, long distance and air reconnaissance. At the operational-tactical level,
intelligence information is also sought and gathered by means of HUMINT[6],
electronic warfare equipment, and is completed with data from geographic and
hydrometeorological support.

7.7.4 **Geographic and hydrometeorological support** personnel are engaged in
producing maps and providing hydrometeorogical information on the state and

5 ISR – Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance.

6 In this case, it is operational-tactical Human Intelligence, i.e. intelligence derived from information
collected and provided by human resources (See AAP-6 NATO Glossary of Terms and Defi nitions).


-----

development of the environment in the area of operations, both in the territory
of the Czech Republic and abroad.

7.7.5 **Artillery units provide both general and direct fi re support. Mortar units provide**
direct fi re support to mechanised forces. Firing weapons of artillery battalions
deliver precisely guided and highly effi cient fi re support up to a 40 km distance
under all climatic conditions. The artillery also offers other capabilities, such as
remote mine-laying or smoke screening.

7.7.6 Assigned artillery components also participate in coordinating fi re support
to Land Forces in joint activities with the Air Force. Artillery reconnaissance
equipment has been integrated into a broader system of military intelligence,
surveillance, reconnaissance and early warning.

7.7.7 **Combat engineer support includes engineer reconnaissance and search,**
removing and building obstacles, design and construction of military bridges
and provisional water-crossing structures, camoufl aging, construction of roads
and temporary military structures, and exploration activities for water extraction
and treatment. Furthermore, combat engineers dispose of dangerous ordnance
(including that which contains chemical agents) and explosive devices, clear
landmines, and provide protection against improvised explosive devices and
their technological and information backup.

7.7.8 In the fi eld of **civil-military cooperation, the capability of cooperating with**
civilian representatives, governmental and non-governmental organizations,
IRS, the Czech Police, the Fire Rescue Service and commercial organizations
is being developed.

7.7.9 **Information operations (INFO OPS) are aimed at achieving information**
superiority. Operations in computer networks are developed as the fi rst priority.
Psychological operations (PSYOPS), which are focused on an adversary
target-group to infl uence their behaviour and attitudes, can be a part of
information operations.

7.7.10 The capability of protection against chemical, biological, radiological and
**nuclear weapons (CBRN Defence) and effects of dangerous agents is**
used both for protecting Czech territory and its population as well as supporting
forces deployed in missions abroad.

7.7.11 Emphasis is placed on ensuring specifi c capabilities, such as the
multifunctional capacity of small CBRN units; effective protection of population,
critical elements of infrastructure, social events of a high signifi cance and
activities during humanitarian and natural disasters; CBRN Reach Back and
Fusion (consultancy for commanders in foreign operations); simulations and
modelling; use of civilian experts, etc.


-----

7.7.12 A further development of this capability necessitates:

� interconnecting individual steps in the science-research-developmentinnovation-application cycle, with an emphasis on practical use;
� concentrating applied research on those areas in which we are traditionally
successful in an international scope, and only monitoring trends in other areas;
� ensuring appropriate assignments of CBRN specialists in the armed forces
units and NATO structures;
� setting down responsibilities of public administration and self-government
bodies for CBRN defence and interconnecting military and civilian
capabilities to respond to crisis situations;
� strengthening the links between civilian and military needs through
cooperation with the national industry.

7.7.13 The role of the Air Force combat support units lies in conducting AntiSurface Air Operations. The tactical air transport and helicopter forces are the
main elements providing this type of support. The helicopter force is ready to
accomplish a broad spectrum of operational missions ranging from logistics
support to assisting special forces.

7.7.14 The Air Defence (AD) elements protect the assets critical for national defence
and can also be deployed in NATO missions, both for supporting Land Forces
and protecting airbases in the homeland as well as abroad. The AD personnel
are prepared to fulfi l operational missions in the international environment in
accordance with the NATO standards.

7.7.15 The Czech Republic **airspace reconnaissance is implemented by means**
of active AD radar systems and completed with information from stationary
passive surveillance systems, military airport radars and civilian air traffi c
control. At the strategic level, this capability is ensured through the Czech
Republic’s participation in NAEW&C7, the allied air defence system[7].

7.7.16 The **radar forces, as a part of NATINADS and the Czech AD National**
Reinforcement System, are capable of ensuring a continuous and uninterrupted
radiolocation coverage from 3,000 up to 30,000 meters above sea level to
detect, track and identify specifi c targets by active radar systems (FADR[8],
MADR[9]). As for altitude up to 3,000 m, airspace reconnaissance is carried out
by creating an incoherent radiolocation fi eld. If need be, the radar forces are
able to move their equipment so as to accomplish missions of the Czech AD
National Reinforcement System and ground-based air defence.

7 NAEW&C – NATO Airborne Early Warning System and Communication.

8 FADR – Fixed Air Defence Radar.

9 MADR – Mobile Air Defence Radar.


-----

7.7.17 The Military Air Traffi c Control is capable of providing airport and approach
control services to military as well as civilian air traffi c in the area of responsibility
of military ATS (Air Traffi c Service) airport stations. In peacetime, the regional
ATS for both general military and compatible air traffi c are covered by a civilian
provider. The Control and Reporting Centre (CRC) ensures the regional ATS
for combat purposes. In a crisis or wartime, these regional air traffi c services
are provided in compliance with the National Crisis Response System.

###### 7.8 Combat Service Support Units

7.8.1 Combat service support incorporates units of military logistics, medical service,
and communication & information support.

7.8.2 **Logistics** generates favourable conditions for preparing and training units,
deploying the armed forces personnel and equipment to operations, and
providing material and services for responding to crisis situations.

7.8.3 Main logistics capabilities are as follows:

� provision of suffi cient transport, storage and repair capacities;
� transport management;
� road traffi c control service;
� RSOM&I (Reception, Staging, Onward Movement and Integration);
� construction and operation of forward logistics bases;
� clearing of battlefi eld;
� reception and support of allied units in Czech territory in the framework of
the Host Nation Support (HNS).

7.8.4 The system of logistic support consists of personnel and equipment that are
subdivided into four levels. Level I – capacities belonging to military units
and facilities. Level II – capacities provided by the logistic support brigade,
as required by deployed forces. Level III – stationary logistic facilities in the
territory of the Czech Republic; operations outside the Czech Republic are
covered by elements of multinational logistics or are contracted. Level IV –
repair enterprises and facilities operating outside the MoD scope of authority.

7.8.5 Interoperability is a key factor for integrating the Czech Republic into the
system of multinational logistics in operations. Interoperability is based on the
standardisation of logistic elements, systems and procedures, building of an
effective National Support Element (NSE), and outsourcing capabilities.


-----

7.8.6 The Multinational Logistics Coordination Centre, located at the General Staff of
the Czech Armed Forces in Prague, is being used to a larger extent to achieve
an effective process of coordinating the development of logistic capabilities,
preparing and training of logistic personnel, and deploying logistic capacities
on multinational operations.

7.8.7 Combat service support missions are also accomplished with an assistance
of the Air Force elements, primarily the air transport and helicopter forces.
Their main role rests in transporting personnel and materials in the Czech
Republic as well as within the framework of international operations and, partly,
providing strategic airlift to the area of operations.

7.8.8 The Air Force also participates in air search and rescue (SAR) activities. In
case of need, personnel and equipment are assigned to the Integrated Rescue
System, including the MoD Air Rescue Coordination Centre.

7.8.9 The Military Medical Service provides medical support to the Czech Armed
Forces throughout the entire spectrum of operations using the Hospital Base
(two fi eld hospitals), inclusive of the MEDEVAC and STRATEVAC[10]) capabilities
by means of the MoD Air Rescue Coordination Centre. Medical service support
runs on the principle of modularity of medical units.

7.8.10 The military medical service covers the full spectrum of medical support
activities for allied units deployed on Czech territory. Furthermore, it earmarks
personnel and equipment for the IRS missions.

7.8.11 **Communication and information support ensures an effective environment**
for command and control activities at all levels with state-of-the-art protection
against cybernetic threats. It supports operational activities, combat command
and control over weapon systems running both in open (unencrypted) and
secret (encrypted) mode, and in real or close to real time. Thanks to their
open architecture, communication and information systems (CIS) can be
interconnected with similar systems used in international operations.

7.8.12 Elements of the Czech Armed Forces use mobile and deployable CIS assets
built in line with the NEC (Network Enabled Capability) principles.

10 MEDEVAC — medical evacuation, STRATEVAC — strategic evacuation of sick and wounded
personnel.


-----

###### 7.9 Command and Control

7.9.1 The two-level command and control (C2) structure is developed in accordance
with NATO/EU principles of interoperability, and ensures C2 both in peacetime
and operations of all types. The system is also interoperable within the IRS.

7.9.2 The main objective of building the C2 system lies in supporting an effective
decision making process of commanders and staffs, ranging from the strategic
down to tactical level.

7.9.3 Individual commands and staffs are prepared to earmark their organic elements
or personnel for national and multinational headquarters. They functionally
manage executive measures of building, development, preparation and
training of forces, including responding to crisis situations in Czech territory.
Specifi c commands have been pre-selected for accomplishing C2 missions in
operations. They are built up to the level of a brigade task force and have the
capacity to exercise command over international forces.

7.9.4 The armed forces use interoperable C2 instruments and systems capable of
delivering data into the common operational picture in real or close to real time,
under conditions of an integrated information environment within a digitalized
battlefi eld. They are able to provide information support to deployed forces
from peacetime establishments and through the Reach Back[11]) capability.

###### 7.10 Military Intelligence

7.10.1 Military Intelligence (MI) is a provider of up-to-date, independent, multisource,
objective, and complex intelligence information. It integrates espionage and
counter-espionage activities and ensures information support for a decisionmaking process at the top national political-military level. Its priorities are
annually set by the Government.

7.10.2 MI uses the principles of project management and augments its capabilities by
operating in cyberspace. At the same time, MI applies new technologies in all
of the covered intelligence fi elds[12].

11 Reach Back – information support to deployed units from home garrisons.

12 i.e. Open Source Intelligence – OSINT, Human Intelligence – HUMINT, Signals Intelligence – SIGINT,
Imagery Intelligence – IMINT and a comprehensive inter-fi eld analysis.


-----

7.10.3 The structural development of foreign worksites corresponds with the
current areas of interest. Sharing information and cooperation are the key
factors; therefore, MI builds up a classifi ed information system based on web
technologies for remote access, which gives individual users selective online access to information based upon the need-to-know principle. It supports
the process of building the National Intelligence Information System with the
capacities for an immediate exchange of important intelligence information.
MI also guarantees the development of the “Military Intelligence” fi eld in the
MoD’s scope of authority.

###### 7.11 Military Police

7.11.1 Military Police are responsible for police protection of the armed forces,
military facilities, military assets and other state properties administered by
organizations within the MoD scope of authority.

7.11.2 Military Police develop their capabilities in the fi eld of prevention, detection
and documentation of unlawful acts, road traffi c control, maintaining law and
order, and protective activities.

7.11.3 Military Police also develop capabilities for executing MP duties in operations
outside Czech territory aimed at training, mentoring and monitoring the local
police components. Military Police are equipped with an appropriate readiness
system for responding to crisis situations.

###### 7.12 Active Reserve

7.12.1 The Active Reserve component has been established in order to satisfy
the citizens´ right to participate in national defence, including in peacetime.
In addition, it is an instrument interconnecting the armed forces with the
civilian sector. The pool of trained personnel increases the Czech defence
capabilities.

7.12.2 The Active Reserve personnel are a part of the Czech Armed Forces with
a special legal status. They reinforce selected units and components of the
armed forces and are called up for regular military exercises or emergency
service if their units are deployed in operations.


-----

7.12.3 The Active Reserve consists of Czech Republic citizens who voluntarily assume
the commitment of military service as well as earmarked deactivated professional
soldiers.

7.12.4 As stipulated by the terms and conditions of their military contracts, professional
soldiers accept the duty to assume, as active reservists, a specifi c position in
a military unit. They become active reservists after terminating their active duty
pursuant to the Contract on Active Reserve Enlistment, specifying their place
of duty based on expertise, rank and other aspects.

###### 7.13 Mobilisation

7.13.1 All forces and assets of the Czech Armed Forces are activated for defending
the Czech Republic and territories of its allies. Successively, a state of national
emergency and state of war are declared in the Czech Republic, and the armed
forces transfer to wartime organizational structures.

7.13.2 The Czech Armed Forces can develop their full strength in peacetime and in
a state of national emergency through special measures (i.e. selectively), or in
the state of war, by means of their mobilisation.

7.13.3 The transfer from the peacetime status to the state of war is defi ned as a set
of procedures and activities applied in Czech territory, as resulting from special
legal provisions, which shall be followed by the state administration, local
government bodies, legal entities and physical persons.

7.13.4 Mobilisation is one of the specifi ed measures for transferring the nation from the
peacetime status to the state of war. Its elementary feature rests in observing
the principles of reasonable suffi ciency and deferred needs while minimising
costs of its preparation. This means that the Czech Republic’s preparation
for mobilisation is concept-based and the country maintains the amounts of
its stocks at a necessary but lowest possible level. The scope and content
of measures for conducting mobilisation refl ect the development of security
situation.

7.13.5 The principle of deferred needs is based on the premise that the Czech
Government will be able to adopt exceptional measures even prior to declaring
the state of national emergency and state of war. Exceptional measures are
being taken in parallel with preliminary measures being implemented in the
Czech Armed Forces. Bringing these measures into practice implies legislative
amendments.

7.13.6 The list of exceptional measures also includes emergency service to be done
primarily in the state of national emergency and war. Upon the Government’s
decision, the transfer to emergency service applies to professional soldiers and
soldiers in active as well as compulsory reserve, even for their pre-deployment
preparation and real operational deployment in peacetime (both inside and
outside the territory of the Czech Republic, except for cases of using the
armed forces for rescue activities, clearing the aftermath of disasters or fi ghting
another imminent danger with use of military equipment).

7.13.7 The system of generating, preparing and using the reserve force is adjusted
to the missions accomplished by the Czech Armed Forces. Its objective rests
in ensuring an adequate number of prepared reservists who will be able, if
needed, augment the armed forces.


-----

7.13.8 Items of military assets are ageing, and costs of their storage and operability
are high. Hence, these factors are refl ected in the system of supply with military
materials, inclusive of satisfying mobilisation requirements. The range and
methods of storing and maintaining materials in operability are elaborated in
the latest version of the Czech Republic Armed Forces Mobilisation Concept.

7.13.9 Furthermore, the role of regional military commands, directly interconnected
with the execution of public administration within the competence of regional
authorities, has been redefi ned. The list of their missions includes providing
support to activities of regional security councils, planning forces and
capacities of the Czech Armed Forces to meet requirements of regional crisis
plans, gathering information on material items that may be used for covering
a regional crisis and national defence plans, participating in operational
preparations of the national territory, requesting the armed forces and
equipment and their coordination in the territory of a region after the state of
emergency is declared, cooperation with the Ministry of Defence in care of
war veterans and military pensioners in their respective region, supporting the
recruitment of new professional soldiers, and preparing citizens for national
defence through educational and lecture activities.

###### 7.14 Information and Communication Technologies

7.14.1 The quantity of information, which must be processed and safely shared with
other military and civilian partners, has been growing considerably. However,
this trend also implies the risk of increasing vulnerability of information and
communication systems. Therefore, attaining information superiority over
potential adversaries, supporting management processes in the area of the
Ministry of Defence and C2 processes in the armed forces, and protecting our
own systems from possible cybernetic attacks are matters of necessity.

7.14.2 The Ministry of Defence strives to operate information and communication
technologies with a maximum level of security; it recruits and maintains
qualifi ed personnel to operate and protect them. Based on the systems of
information and know-how management, the MoD ensures:

� collection of information necessary for national administration and defence
and their evaluation;
� distribution of this information to designated persons, entities and
organizations;
� is capable of deploying a mobile team to deal with a cybernetic incident.


-----

7.14.3 Criteria for assessing the effi ciency of information services are based on the
level of support provided by the information processes within the Ministry of
Defence and degree of interoperability with communication and information
systems of NATO/EU countries and the e-government of the Czech public
administration.

7.14.4 In the framework of the Czech MoD, informatisation is running under central
control. Its development is aimed at improving capabilities of effective and
procedural management of available sources and common information
services which ensure, together with instruments of internal communication,
availability of timely and relevant information.

###### 7.15 Cyber Security

7.15.1 The list of main missions in the fi eld of cybernetic security includes protection
of the MoD communication and information structure against cybernetic attacks
and support to the armed forces throughout the entire spectrum of computer
operations[13].

7.15.2 The Ministry of Defence, in coordination with the national entity accredited
with cybernetic security, contributes to protecting the Czech Republic against
cybernetic threats.

7.15.3 The Czech Republic has unique research and development capacities in
the sphere of cybernetic security. Therefore, the Ministry of Defence actively
develops this capability not only in the national but allied context as well.

7.15.4 In accordance with the requirements resulting from the Lisbon NATO Summit,
the Ministry of Defence:

� monitors security of all its unclassifi ed as well as classifi ed stationary and
tactical information systems against cyber-attacks;
� detects security incidents caused by cyber-attacks or as a consequence of
violating security regulations by MoD personnel ;
� is capable of deploying a mobile team to deal with a cybernetic incident.

13 In accordance with NATO Information Operations Doctrine AJP-3.10.


-----

###### 7.16 Information Operations

7.16.1 The importance of information operations as a key method for achieving and
maintaining information superiority has increased mainly during the last 10 to 15
years. The capability of responding to new threats resulting from a rapid growth
of informatisation of the society on a global scale must be interconnected with
the process of building and developing the Czech Armed Force’s operational
capabilities.

7.16.2 The Ministry of Defence effi ciently coordinates activities infl uencing the will,
understanding and capabilities of an adversary in order to pursue the security
interests of the Czech Republic and the North Atlantic Alliance.

###### 7.17 Strategic Communication

7.17.1 In a world dominated by media, the Ministry of Defence must be able to
establish and maintain fast, reliable, effective and consistent communication
with key internal, external, national and international target groups.

7.17.2 The MoD body responsible for communication adopts a position towards key
topics and coordinates all other MoD components engaged in communication.
Emphasis is also placed on internal communication which provides relevant and
timely information to both military and civilian personnel and ensures feedback.

7.17.3 The Ministry of Defence, within its fi nancial and capacity resources, actively
cooperates with non-governmental organizations, expert teams and civilian
academic institutions. This contributes to gaining support from the broader
public and its understanding of the roles of the armed forces in society and
their engagement in activities of the Alliance.

###### 7.18 Research, Experimental Development and Innovations

7.18.1 The Ministry of Defence has an interest in supporting various projects in the
fi eld of research, experimental development and innovations that will lead
to development of the Czech Armed Force’s capabilities and potentially
strengthen competitiveness of the Czech economy.

7.18.2 The MoD supports maximum transparency in competing for fi nancial resources
allocated from the national budget in line with the Government’s document
entitled National Policy of Research, Development and Innovation of the
Czech Republic for 2009–2015 and the current version of the Security Strategy


-----

while respecting the prioritised fi elds of development of military capabilities.
The Ministry of Defence has an interest in long-term development of national
capacities supporting:

� capabilities declared by the Czech Republic as its specialization within the
NATO and the EU or shared capabilities with a NATO/EU member state;
� capabilities identifi ed by the NATO Research and Technology Organization
(NATO RTO) and the European Defence Agency (EDA) as crucial for
development of the armed forces;
� fi elds in which the Czech Republic has already attained sound R&D
potential (e.g. cybernetics, robotisation, nanotechnologies, individual active
and passive protection and equipment, weapons of mass destruction);
� the MoD capability of conducting personnel management and development
of the armed forces, including with the assistance of sociological surveys
and polls;
� capabilities of making strategic analyses of trends in the fi eld of international
security, nature of risks, threats and confl icts, and the role of the armed forces
and civilian actors participating therein.

7.18.3 A necessary condition for ensuring effectiveness of investments into science
and experimental development lies in the maximum application of R&D results
in practice. The Ministry of Defence strictly requires establishing effi cient
feedback from end users of R&D products, i.e. carriers of military capabilities
(military units and facilities).


-----

7.18.4 The MoD scientifi c research and development capacity, its size and legal
forms, have been transformed so as to correspond with modern trends in
scientifi c research in the Czech Republic and the European Union.

7.18.5 Favourable conditions for transferring the achieved know-how into the fi eld
of defence and dual technologies are being created in cooperation with the
defence industry, universities and public research institutes. The Ministry of
Defence also supports projects in the sphere of humanities with focus on the
development of security studies and strategic thinking.

7.18.6 The Ministry of Defence has joined international development programmes
and projects and also supports close cooperation and coordination between
the North Atlantic Alliance and the European Union. Within the framework
of the NATO Research and Technology Organization and the European
Defence Agency, it puts forth national requirements for defence research
and development and promotes participation of Czech companies in relevant
international research projects.

###### 7.19 Cooperation with Defence Industry

7.19.1 Development of the Czech defence industry, especially in the area of advanced
technologies, is obviously in the MoD’s interest. Cooperation with the defence
industry is based on:

� a legislative environment that enables competitive biddings under
transparent, pragmatic and non-discriminatory conditions;
� direct acquisitions of military materials and services excluding intermediaries,
and transferring a signifi cant portion of responsibility for delivery of materials
and services to contractors;
� following the principles of Total Life-Cycle Management pursuant to the
CALS international standards (Continuous Acquisition and Life-Cycle
Support);
� capabilities of individual defence industry companies not only to meet
technical requirements from the Ministry of Defence but also to improve
internal managerial systems, including management of quality, confi guration,
trouble-free operation, maintainability, etc. based on national and
international standards, both in the area of material products and services.

7.19.2 The Ministry of Defence promotes preservation some military-specifi c, and
otherwise irreplaceable from other sources, capacities of the industrial
production, research and development in the Czech Republic, both within and
beyond its scope of authority.


-----

###### 7.20 Sustainability of the Czech Armed Forces Capabilities

7.20.1 During the last ten years, the Czech Republic has invested substantial
fi nancial resources into national defence. Supersonic jets have been leased
to protect Czech airspace, trucks have been partially replaced, the purchases
of armoured personnel carriers and light fi ghting vehicles have advanced
modernisation of the mechanised forces, a part of transport aircraft has been
replaced and transport helicopters modernised, some items of the air defence
equipment have been modernised, and new assault rifl es are being procured.

7.20.2 However, Czech defence spending has been gradually decreasing since 2006.
However, the process of renewal of main weapon and technical systems,
which form the basis of the armed forces capabilities, is yet to be completed. In
addition to increasing cost of work, the costs per soldier are also growing. The
defi cit has reached alarming numbers, yet the extent and degree of diffi culty and
risks placed on the armed forces are rising. The difference between growing
requirements and diminishing resources is not sustainable in the long run.

7.20.3 These trends increase the risk that the set of capabilities, indispensable for
ensuring all current functions of the armed forces and fulfi lling the politicalmilitary ambitions, will become unachievable.

7.20.4 An alarming fact is that around the year of 2015, the life-cycle expiration
periods of several expensive systems, which implies a possible modernisation
process through purchase investments, are converging within a short time
horizon. Another critical threshold is the year of 2020, as it specifi cally concerns
the supersonic jets, airport radars, 2K12 KUB surface-to-air missile system,
replacement of 120 mm mortars, modernisation or replacement of the infantry
fi ghting vehicles, artillery and engineering equipment. Therefore, reaching
full operational capability of the armed forces by 2018, as planned appears
to be unrealistic. For this reason, it is necessary to consider the reduction of
capabilities, especially those that are not utterly indispensable with regard to
the roles and functions of the Czech Armed Forces[14] .

7.20.5 In light of these fi ndings, and under the premise that the budget will not be raised
so as to cover the modernisation requirements, future investments will have
to be prioritised. In terms of their preservation and development, the preferred
capabilities will have to meet the following criteria:

� ensure effective support and conditions for accepting the allied forces in
Czech territory (HNS) and cybernetic protection;

14 See the Pyramid Model of Capabilities and Methods of their Reduction in Times of Shortage of
Resources, as shown at the end of this chapter.


-----

� increase interoperability, deployability and sustainability of forces according
to the NATO standards for all types of crisis situations, especially
through engagement in international operations, NATO Response Force
and EU forces;
� entail material and equipment that is most probably expected to be deployed
on operations in the next fi ve years, including equipment and material for
protecting troops, and achieving an added technological value, for example
by means of specialisation on CBRN defence;
� fulfi l the minimum military requirements for protecting Czech airspace;
� ensure capacities for providing effi cient support to the Integrated Rescue
System (IRS).


-----

7.20.6 Therefore, the Ministry of Defence has identifi ed the following measures to be
adopted:

� retain the tactical Air Force, equipped with both supersonic and subsonic
aircraft for defending the Czech Republic airspace, but discontinue the
development of the anti-aircraft missile defence based on the 2K12 KUB
system. This measure corresponds with the NATO recommendation in
whose framework a new territorial anti-missile defence is being built.
The Short Range Air Defence (SHORAD) capability must be preserved
and developed;
� gradually withdraw from active service the Mi–24/35 attack helicopters
whose level of ballistic protection is low, avionics obsolete, and that are
not interoperable by NATO standards. No more investments shall be
placed in this capability. As soon as possible, the newer Mi–35 attack
helicopters should be sold off and attention should focus on capabilities
of the transport helicopter fl eet that can be used not only in the framework
of NATO collective defence but also for the Integrated Rescue System;
� stop investments in the further development of passive surveillance
systems. Concentrate on a renewal and development of the systems
of stationary and mobile radars which are directly linked to the NATO
Integrated Air Defence System (NATINADS);
� shut down at least one of the four tactical airbases. In its regular
evaluation, NATO recommends concentrating the air force on two tactical
airbases;
� gradually decommission the tracked infantry fi ghting vehicles (BMPs).
Regarding their technical parameters, retain the BMP–2 in active service
till the end of their life span (2018–2020). The decision to either modernize
or replace the BMP–1 shall be made no later than the end of 2013;
� preserve the capability of the tank battalion till the end of its life span
(approx. 2025), and consider the usefulness of its further development.
Sell off the stored inactive tanks as soon as possible;
� reassess mobilisation needs, primarily retain and develop the Host Nation
Support (HNS), i.e. capacities for the operational preparation of the territory
to receive allied support; and dispose of, as soon as possible, all redundant
material;
� by the middle of 2012, fi nd appropriate ways of using the Biological
Protection Centre in Těchonín (sharing its capacities with other
ministries or organizations involved in the Czech security system or in
the framework of international cooperation), or shut it down and invest
the saved resources in development of the CBRN Defence Centre.

###### Chapter 8

 Procurement and Asset Management

8.1 Ownership or renting of assets, building and operating their own capacities
for providing or acquiring contract-based services are inseparable activities
to ensure effi cient functioning of the armed forces. For a long time, property
management and acquisitions carried out in the MoD scope of activities have
been associated with lack of transparency, poor planning, absence of clearly
defi ned decision-making authority, responsibility in procuring and using goods
and services acquired from resources allocated for defence of the Czech
Republic.

8.2 This situation cannot be tolerated any longer. Therefore, procurement,
contracting, and asset management are being implemented in the framework of
a transparent and effective acquisition process.

###### Acquisition System

8.3 The Ministry of Defence has undertaken structural reform of the acquisition
system, including open competition in public contract area, and asset
management. This reform is based on the following principles: transparent,
directed and target-oriented planning; clearly designated responsibilities of
users for appropriately and factually defi ned needs and requirements; and
professional management of the acquisition process in the system of central
purchasing. This system operates under a qualifi ed and independent technical
and legal monitoring.


-----

8.4 In this system, the method of implementing calls for bids prevents both
the tailoring of criteria to favour a specifi c contractor and discrimination of
potential bidders. Defi ned qualities of the procured product or service must be
appropriate to the objective for which the purchase is intended.

8.5 The identifi cation of needs is the fi rst step in each acquisition process that is
gradually and in a controlled manner transformed into a fi nal specifi cation of
required products or services and their life-cycle cost. There are maximum
of restrictions to above-standard specifi cations that necessitate additional
development, uneffi ciant multipling number of subcontractors or creating
conditions for including unproductive intermediaries who make the fi nal product
more expensive. Therefore, the Ministry of Defence prefers off-the-shelf
solutions whenever possible, goods and services are acquired in an open call
for tenders.

8.6 Procurement is strictly based on thoroughgoing market survey; requests for
information are addressed directly to manufacturers. Competitive bidding is
a condition for achieving the lowest possible price for the required quality of
purchased products and services.

8.7 Process management explicitly defi nes roles and responsibilities of personnel
involved in the acquisition system. Pertinent authorities, instruments and
resources are conferred to these persons. The division of responsibility is
clearly specifi ed so that particular persons are responsible for individual steps or
phases of the acquisition process. Qualifi ed project managers with designated
authority manage long-term, complex acquisitions or those of high importance
to the MoD or the Czech Republic.


-----

8.8 The transparency and severe monitoring of acquisition process ensuring
information about personal responsibility for errors and omissions is strenghtened by a strict separation of the role of user (a target manager), systems
maintanence manager (a person responsible for a administration of group of
assets), economic experts and purchasers. Through the planning process, the
liability for an acquisition subject is transferred to a target manager.

8.9 In the framework of planning, target managers are not only accountable for
executing their tasks, but they also have possibilities and authorities to request
necessary resources. Target managers hold the direct responsibility for costs
expended on attaining their target. Asset managers provide material support to
target managers.

8.10 Asset managers are accountable for managing the group of assets entrusted
to them. In addition to covering requests

###### Transparency is strengthened by from target managers, they prepare new a strict separation of the role of acquisitions, maintain current assets, control asset managers, economic experts their life-cycle and administer stocks. At the

same time, they participate in monitoring

###### and purchasers.

expenses and their cost-effectiveness.

8.11 Both target and asset managers are supported by economic experts. Their
role rests in setting maximum fi nancial limits needed for attaining targets, and
assisting their managers in breaking down expenditures into individual projects
staggered over time.

8.12 A contract subject is monitored by the independent Acquisitions Monitoring
Offi ce, which oversees the quality of the terms of an open call for tenders and
its fairness. The offi ce is authorized to stop any prepared tender if there any
justifi ed suspicions of breaking the law. The offi ce also cooperates with external
experts.

8.13 Two central bodies of the Czech Ministry of Defence implement the acquisition
process: 1) National Offi ce for Armament specialised on weapons acquisition,
and products of military use and 2) Central Purchasing Offi ce for procurement
services and products of non-military use. While these offi ces are not authorized
to change the already approved needs and requirements from submitters, they
are responsible for their transparent and effective implementation.

8.14 These bodies also hold responsibility for entering into contracts and maintaining
contacts with contractors. In parallel, they support systems maintenance
administrators and fi nal users in handling technical aspects of taking over the
deliveries.


-----

8.15 The Ministry of Defence also uses the services of specialised acquisition
NATO/EU centres such as NAMSA[1] for its acquisitions. The MoD prefers
this approach especially in joint or consolidated acquisitions (i.e. joining an
acquisition which is already running in another country).

8.16 The Ministry of Defence struggles for restricting deliveries from intermediate
parties, such as companies established for acquiring and subsequent selling
of military materials. Priority is given to fair business with end manufacturers or
using assembly capacities of auxiliary organizations managed by the MoD (i.e.
repair works).

8.17 Throughout its duration, the acquisition process is managed, monitored and
evaluated on the basis of basic indexes and economic indicators. MoD managers
monitor costs of cost centres, stock movement and utilization of capital, volumes
of anticipated public contracts, value of outstanding orders obligations and
fl uctuation of contractual obligations. In a fi scal year, these measures enable the
monitoring of all actors in the acquisition process in on-line as well as keeping
a good track of the numbers and value of required acquisition contracts.

###### Asset Management

8.18 In terms of being able to accomplish their missions, it is essential that the
Czech Armed Forces are equipped with the following: appropriate and effi cient
weapons; technical and communication systems that correspond with their
missions and Czech international commitments; transport and logistic capacities
supporting their activities; accommodation in well-furnished and operable bases;
and access to necessary training facilities, technologies and materials.

8.19 In the last ten years, the Ministry of Defence and entities within its scope of
authority took ownership of fi xed assets valued at approximately 230 billion
CZK. The shift from a conscription army to an all-volunteer force has been
the impulse for a reduction of fi xed assets, especially for releasing surplus
mobilization supplies. Nonetheless, there has been an excessive fi xed asset
which is a troublesome fi nancial burden. There was in inventory of MoD over
17,000 accounting entries of fi xed assets and more than 25,000 plots in 2011.
Furthermore, the state of buildings that do not meet required energy and
ecological standards, including the necessity of their structural adjustment
based on EU standards, is another cost-increasing factor.

1 _NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency._


-----

-----

8.20 The Ministry of Defence is expediting the reduction of the volume of fi xed assets
in its ownership to be more appropriate to the size, needs and capabilities of the
armed forces.

8.21 The MoD prefers selling off of decommissioned assets to non-state ownership.
Assets are being sold in transparent, economical and effective manner. Through
improved offering and promotion of assets for sale, including use of e-auctions,
the process minimizes selling costs and maximizes sales revenues.

Source: Czech MoD

8.22 Sales revenues are ploughed back/reinvested into prospective estate assets in
order to improve conditions for the activities of the Czech Armed Forces and to
refurbish the neglected infrastructure.

8.23 With regard to the strength of the armed forces, the total size of the Military
Training Areas (MTA) with surrounding lands and properties is disproportionately
large. Since 1989, only two MTAs have been abandoned, even though the
reduction in the number of the armed forces has been multifold. In 1993, the
military area-per-soldier ratio was 1.1 hectares, whereas in 2011 it was fi vefold,
or 5.6 hectares. Therefore, by 2015 the number of MTAs (with adjacent lands
and properties) and their acreage will decrease to be appropriate to real needs
of the armed forces.


-----

8.24 The concept of locating military units and facilities2 has been reviewed in
such a manner that the current network of garrisons and military locations
will be reduced no later than 2015. Properties designated as not needed will
be abandoned no later than 2018. In light of these relocations and life-cycle
management of moveable assets, disposal of redundant assets and their further
processing have been expedited.

8.25 The Ministry of Defence and its entities continue to spend on clearing
environmental burdens. They simultaneously implement constructional and
technical measures to reduce energy consumption of selected military premises
through the insulation and energy cost reduction programme.

8.26 Local heating stations are being transformed to operate on environment-friendly
fuels, principally natural gas; in some cases, they are replaced with service
connection to local suppliers. Energy costs are being lowered and idle capacities
are used for commercial purposes.

8.27 Facility management is ensured via outsourced integrated services.

8.28 The Ministry of Defence has been re-evaluate its housing and billeting policy.
It continues to sell the remaining apartment units and enhance the effectiveness
of its billeting facilities. Furthermore, the system of subsidised accommodation
is being reviewed and linked to services provided to the Czech Armed Forces.
Vacant capacities are being used commercially.

8.29 The Ministry of Defence is aware of its responsibility towards the cultural
heritage and ecclesiastical items in its ownership. It co-fi nances, maintains and
operates these historical sights while respecting their cultural values. It also
enables their usage in a controlled manner.

8.30 In connection with the changes to the concept of mobilisation, redundant assets
are being disposed of. The disposal process shall be completed by the end
of 2015 so that only those items that are needed for supporting activities of
the Czech Armed Forces are in stock as of 1 January 2016. The process of
disposing of excessive stocks continues.

8.31 The planning mechanism for renewal of moveable fi xed assets is based on the
life-cycle of individual items. Purchases on such kind of assets are carried out
effectively and economically in compliance with mid-term planning and in the
spirit of the aforementioned reform of the acquisition process.

###### Services and Business Activities Supplied by MoD Entities

8.32 Military medical service belongs among the fundamental capabilities of the
Czech Armed Forces. The stationary hospitals are designed for specialised
professional training of military doctors for their potential deployment to areas
of armed confl ict or foreign missions. At the same time, they provide services to
military personnel of the Czech Armed Forces, Ministry of Defence as well as
civilians in their designated areas

8.33 A key prerequisite for the operation of military hospitals is their ability to run
a balanced budget, which is based on the principle of equal rates of services
provided to the Czech Armed Forces and those provided to civilian patients
are covered by their health insurance. The Ministry of Defence is correcting
the current state of affairs whereby the rates for services rendered by military
hospitals are undervalued in comparison to those provided by civilian facilities
and the difference is subsidized by the MoD.

8.34 The network of military medical facilities is complemented with centres providing
balneotherapy, preventive rehabilitation, medical, therapeutic and recreational
care and comprehensive care for war veterans.


-----

8.35 Some medical facilities suffer from consequences of ill-conceived decisions and
infl ated investments that are currently projected in high costs. The Ministry of
Defence has taken restructuralisation measures and is determined to complete
them. Some of these measures may include abandoning certain fi elds of medical
care or changing the whole structure of these facilities.

8.36 The Ministry of Defence is an initiator of LOM Prague (SOE) and VOP–026
Šternberk (SOE), the only two state-owned enterprises specialised in
repairing military equipment and its associated engineering production.
Between 2011 and 2013, they will undergo a process of restructuring and
trimming of redundant assets and secondary services pursuant to the longterm concept of the development of these enterprises.

8.37 As a specifi c entity, the Military Railhead Offi ce is the only public administration
body operating within the MoD scope of authority. The offi ce administers railway
capacities in the ownership of the Ministry of Defence that are needed especially
for getting logistic access to military areas. Its activities are directly tied with
development of the Czech railway network.

8.38 The Ministry of Defence is aware of the fact that the railway infrastructure
operating under its authority is partly neglected and will require investments.
The MoD will considered the option of leasing the railway vehicles while
considering investment requirements.

8.39 The Military Forests and Estates of the Czech Republic is a state-owned
company wose activities centre on military training areas. It also supports
training of the Czech Armed Forces and their allies.

8.40 In the fi eld of physical training and sport, there are three subsidized organisations
operating within the MoD sphere of authority – Sports Research Institute of the
Czech Armed Forces (CASRI), Volleyball Club VK Dukla Liberec, and Handball
Club Dukla Prague.

 Administrative Control System

9.1 The Ministry of Defence has been creating a consolidated and compact
administrative control system consisting of three pillars: control executed by
competent persons in positions of senior executives as well as commanders,
control carried out by specialised control authorities such internal comptrollers,
inspectors, and supervisors, and evaluation of process effectiveness through
internal audit.

9.2 The administrative control system is divided into three main domains: national
defence readiness, management of public funds, and protection of human rights.

9.3 A system of risk management capable of identifying high risk areas within the
armed forces and the Ministry of Defence has been introduced. The mapping of
risks is conducted at the MoD strategic

###### The mapping of risks… includes management level which includes operational, fi nancial, legal and social operational, fi nancial, legal and social risks and recommends actions that might risks and recommends actions that

might be taken in order to remove or at

###### be taken in order to remove or at least 

least alleviate those risks. As a result,

###### alleviate those risks. control authorities are assigned more

effectively.

9.4 The methodology of conducting control is set by internal rules and regulations
and it respects the Public Funds Control Act and other legal regulations.The
hierarchy of arranging internal rules and regulations is based on a three-level
system: 1) orders by the MoD, 2) normative directives, and 3) regulations.


-----

These internal rules and regulations are guaranteed and consolidated by
a methodological unit that is responsible for bringing them into effect. Control
authorities and an independent internal audit enforce these rules.

9.5 The methodology unit regularly trains individual managers on control activities
within their sphere of responsibility and familiarises them with changes in control
processes. Continuous controls are carried out at hierarchical levels to enable
the actual conduct of control. The formal control procedures that fail to meet the
purpose have been removed.

9.6 Follow-up and process controls are conducted by special bodies established
for conducting control activities. These bodies are manned and equipped to
be able to complete all inspection activities as required. Inspection personnel
participate in a mandatory system of life-long education designed by the
manager of the control body. The Ministry of Defence supports this education
by allocating suffi cient material and fi nancial resources.

9.7 Individual control bodies share information and follow the same methodology
for developing control reports and informing inspected persons on the results.

9.8 Control bodies are organized in such a manner as to complement each
other’s scope of authority. Control activities focused on public resource
management, budget & resource management and missions being fulfi lled
by the armed forces are complemented by investigations of notifi cations
submitted by personnel from MoD entities,

###### The Ministry of Defence assigns contractors or other persons. The Ministry

of Defence is open to any suggestions from

###### personal responsibility to those

the public, it maximises access to information

###### employees who violate legal rules on its activities and makes control fi ndings and internal regulations. public unless those are in confl ict with legal

provisions.

9.9 Should any suspicion of a criminal act arise, the control bodies will cooperate
with the Military Police and other bodies active in penal proceedings.

9.10 Employees have access to control fi ndings in the central database under the
condition that personal data and classifi ed information is properly secured. If
deemed appropriate due the nature of the fi ndings, control fi ndings are further
elaborated by the Methodology Department to amend internal regulations.

9.11 The Ministry of Defence assigns personal responsibility to those employees who
violate legal rules and internal regulations if damage to state-owned property
arises, inclusive of enforcing indemnities.

9.12 The Ministry of Defence is building a robust anti-corruption program based on
the principles of the code of ethics, public openness and life-long education
of personnel occupying ethically sensitive positions. This system is supported
by managing specifi c risks, setting continuous controls and monitoring nonstandard transactions. MoD leadership is in the vanguard of the effort to raise
the level of ethical conduct and encourages its personnel to openness in
exchanging opinions and informing on unethical conduct.


-----

9.13 The control bodies closely cooperate with other public administration entities
engaged in external control, both in the process of executing specifi c controls
and in the fi eld of methodology and education.

###### Chapter 10

 The MoD Organizational Structure and Management

10.1 In every organization, effi cient and rational structures of management must
result from the objectives of its activities. Thus the organizational format
must respect and follow processes and functions that lead to achieving these
objectives. The current MoD organizational architecture does not correspond to
these principles. On the contrary, it often creates unproductive bodies with their
own agendas and duplicated processes.

10.2 At all levels in its system, the Ministry of Defence and its entities display
problems stemming from the existence of organizational structures built in silos
and managed in a linear way.

10.3 This situation has resulted in a complicated and excessive apparatus with
high personnel costs, which considerably burdens the Ministry of Defence with
operative activities and associated administrative work. Instead of running
conceptual activities, the Ministry is involved in meaningless bureaucratic
procedures and processes and non-transparent internal regulations and
is insuffi ciently integrated. Moreover, the information system can hardly be
used for providing direct support to management. Implementing horizontal
communication and coordination among individual lines of organization is
almost impossible at the lower levels.

10.4 As a consequence of these undesired features, individual bodies within the
MoD sector are facing diffi culties in mutual cooperation and coordination, and
ambiguity in the system of distributing authorities, duties and responsibilities.


-----

This cumbersome bureaucratic process limits the fl exibility and effi ciency of the
management system. The use of modern and proven instruments, especially
project and process management, is formal and ineffi cient.

10.5 Therefore, corrective measures for removing these problems and defi ciencies
call for decisive interventions into the MoD organizational structures as well as
management and performance processes. The new organizational model stems
from analyses of processes and functions of the MoD and its components while
respecting main directions and objectives of their activities, as described in
previous chapters. This model has been created on the basis of results from
the process audits conducted for the Ministry in the past, analyses of agencies
in comparable countries and recommendations from consultations with NATO
experts.

10.6 According to this new model, the Ministry of Defence has been designed as
a strictly strategic, conceptual, standard-setting and administrative body with
minimal executive competencies. Those executive activities which are not directly
related to strategic, conceptual, standard-setting or administrative functions are
being centralised and transferred from individual MoD organizational units to
subordinate agencies that are not incorporated in its structure.

10.7 The General Staff of the Czech Armed Forces is an integral part of the Ministry
of Defence. Its main mission is to ensure command over Czech Armed Forces.
It has been relieved from administrative and other activities unrelated to its main
missions.

10.8 The management of activities formerly executed by the Joint Forces Command
and Support Forces Command at the operational C2 level have been transferred
to appropriate units of the General Staff or commands of subordinate units.

10.9 Activities of strategic, conceptual, standard-setting or administrative nature
currently implemented by units and facilities directly subordinate to the Ministry
of Defence or the commands of forces have been, conversely, transferred to the
pertinent MoD units, including the General Staff of the Czech Armed Forces.

10.10 The organizational structure of the Ministry of Defence has been optimised
and simplifi ed. To the maximum possible extent, bureaucratic barriers among
its individual organizational units have been cleared, organizational transfers/
crossovers reduced, duplicate activities removed, and processes simplifi ed.
Horizontal communication and coordination are conducted effi ciently and
effectively.

10.11 The number of personnel in the civilian segment of the Ministry of Defence has
been reduced, which has created further pressure to simplify management and
executive processes implemented at individual managerial levels. Rigorous


-----

implementation of objective-based management, combined the tools of project
and process management, aptly complements the current line management.
The above-mentioned instruments present an alternative wherever suitable
and possible. Leading personnel of the MoD organizational units function as
managers of objectives, projects and processes entrusted to them.

10.12 Project management instruments are used not only for large acquisition projects,
but also for the preparation and implementation of fundamental changes in the
system and organization, whose supervision would not be effective should line
or process management methods be used.

10.13 The new organizational structure refl ects the need to separate the conceptual
component that ensures political-military and economic decision-making from the
executive component that is responsible for routine operation and administrative
activities. It is subdivided into three civilian and four military sectors, two central
offi ces (National Offi ce for Armament and Procurement Supervision Offi ce) and
six specifi c units directly subordinated to the Minister of Defence.

10.14 Offi cials directly subordinate to the Minister of Defence

10.20 The Force Control and Preparation Sector manages the process of accomplishing
the tasks of building and development of capabilities, preparing and training the
Czech Armed Forces personnel for their deployment on operations, including
training of the reserve forces. Furthermore, in its sphere of authority, this sector
incorporates military training and representative facilities, higher and regular
units of the Land Forces and Air Force, including the Military Geographic and
Hydrometeorogical Offi ce.

10.21 The Support Force Sector controls stationary and fi eld logistics, military medical
service, signal corps with mobile C2 systems and aspects of NEC, and further
supporting services. It administrates pertinent groups of military material and
equipment. In addition, the sector is responsible for higher units, regular units
and facilities of logistics, military medical service and signal corps.

10.22 The Force Deployment Sector manages operational planning, deployment of
forces on operations and their comprehensive support, including intelligence. It
also controls and coordinates task forces as well as other deployed units and
personnel. The Situation Centre is also incorporated into this sector.

10.23 The National Offi ce for Armament is managed by the Deputy Minister – National
Director for Armament. This Offi ce implements project management and armament
acquisitions, coordinates defence research and activities run by the Defence
Standardisation, Codifi cation and Government Quality Assurance Authority.

10.24 Other deputies have been excluded from the line structure and are mandated
with tasks pertaining to conceptual management of employment policy, military
education and culture, relations with military veterans, links to the national budget
and fi nancial inspection. Furthermore, as project managers tasked directly by the
Minister of Defence, they are responsible for conceptual tasks and management
of strategic projects, which have a crucial importance for the development of the
MoD. As for the years of 2011 through 2014, the projects are as follows:

� reform of the evaluation and reward system;
� reform of education and training;
� enhance of veterans care;
� stabilisation of budget revenues;
� reform of fi nancial planning;
� other projects as needed.


-----

Ministry of Defence. Furthermore, it manages the Military History Institute
and military sports centres and ensures press and communication services.

10.26 The Internal Audit Department executes internal auditing in compliance with
Act. 320/2001.

10.27 The Minister of Defence Inspectorate is the highest MoD inspection body. Its
establishment has been stipulated by law.

10.28 The Procurement Supervision Offi ce is directly subordinated to the Minister of
Defence. This offi ce performs independent monitoring and inspection of the MoD
acquisition processes, including those run by the National Offi ce for Armament.
In addition, it supervises asset sale procedures.

10.29 The Security Director guarantees the observance of Act 412/2005 “On
Protection of Classifi ed Information and Security Clearance“ and is responsible
for setting the concept on protection of classifi ed and unclassifi ed information
at the Ministry of Defence and monitoring the process so that its principles are
properly respected.

10.30 Military Intelligence integrates both espionage and counter-espionage activities
and provides information support for the decision making process at the top
national political-military level.

10.31 As of 1 January 2013, the General Moravec 601st Special Forces Group,
