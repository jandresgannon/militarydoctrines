#### A. Introduction

1. The Defence Strategy outlines the approach of the Government of the Czech Republic to national
defence in the present decade. The Defence Strategy presents the guiding principles for the development
and functioning of the National Defence System, reviews key tasks of the Armed Forces and updates
the national political-military ambitions.

2. The Strategy complies with the existing national defence legislation, particularly the Constitution
of the Czech Republic and other related Acts.[1]

3. The Defence Strategy is based on the principles, security interests and values formulated in the Security

_Strategy of the Czech Republic (2011). It also reflects the Strategic Concept of NATO (2010) and ap­pro­pri­ate_
security policies of the European Union.

**1** The defence of the Czech Republic is governed especially by the Constitutional Act No. 1/1993, the Constitution of the Czech Republic; Constitutional Act
No. 110/1998, on Security of the Czech Republic; Act No. 219/1999, on the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic; Act No. 221/1999, on Professional Soldiers;
Act No. 220/1999, on the Course of Conscription or Alternate Service and Military Exercises and Some Legal Relations of Reserve Soldiers; Act No. 222/1999,
on Arrangements for Defence of the Czech Republic; Act No. 585/2004, on Conscription and its Ensuring (the Conscription Act); Act No. 124/1992, on Military
Police; Act No. 153/1994, on Intelligence Services of the Czech Republic; Act No. 289/2005, on Military Intelligence.

#### B. The Strategic Context

4. I n terms of its defence and security, the Czech Republic has long enjoyed a favourable situation.
The Czech Republic’s borders are internationally recognised and undisputed, it maintains good relations
with all its neighbours, and it is fully integrated into the Euro-Atlantic structures. The Czech Republic’s
active participation in the collective defence system of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO),
its support in the development of the European Union’s (EU) crisis management capabilities, and
the deepening of cooperation with partner countries constitute the basic guarantees and principles
for safeguarding defence and strengthening national security. Its membership in NATO and the EU
brings with it the advantages of collective guarantees for national defence and security, as well
as the commitment to contribute to the collective defence and security of Allies.[2]

5. The Czech Republic ensures the defence of its sovereignty and territorial integrity within the frame­

work of NATO’s collective defence in accordance with Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.[3] The Czech
Republic’s membership in NATO and other international security organisations does not absolve
it of the primary responsibility for its own defence. The essential prerequisite for meeting the legal
obligations and commitments to Allies is building an effective national defence system and national
defence capabilities in accordance with Article 3 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which binds the Allies,
separately and jointly, by means of continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid, to maintain and
develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack.

6. The international environment affecting the Czech Republic’s security and defence will continue
to be dynamic and complex in nature. It will entail predominantly non-military, usually asymmetric,
threats, and will be characterized by intertwining internal and external security dimensions. The Security
_Strategy of the Czech Republic_ does not specifically identify any direct military threat to the territory,
citizens or interests of the Czech Republic and its Allies, nor does it preclude it. Although anticipated
threats are non-military in nature, their impact may require employment of the Armed Forces both as part
of multinational operations abroad and in support of civilian authorities in the territory of the Czech
Republic.

7. I n the long term, the substantial growth of advanced military capabilities and of the overall strategic
potential of some states in the European neighbourhood and the Asia-Pacific region cannot be ignored.
The impact of these two trends on global stability and Euro-Atlantic security is difficult to predict at this
point in time.

**2** See the Security Strategy of the Czech Republic, Article 11.

**3** Promulgated under Act No. 66/1999. Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty: “The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North
America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right
of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith,
individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security
of the North Atlantic area. Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the Security Council. Such measures
shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security.“

8. At the same time, the occurrence of sudden and surprising events – strategic shocks – cannot be excluded
during the course of the present decade, including in the Euro-Atlantic area or its vicinity. These
could escalate into a serious crisis or conflict. They may result from the confluence and concentration
of developments that are manageable individually, but establish a potentially explosive mixture when
combined (such as economic shocks, escalation of social, ethnic or religious disputes, energy breakdowns,
mass migration, pandemics, natural or manmade disasters). In extremis, destabilisation or paralysis
of international institutions, in the framework of which the Czech Republic defines its security and
defence, cannot be fully ruled out. Such a situation would require a major review of national defence
principles.

9. As the United States of America (US) rebalances its geopolitical interests towards Asia, there will
be a growing requirement for Europeans to take up a greater share of responsibility for their own
defence and security. Growing differences in the level of defence investments and uneven sharing
of the responsibility for collective defence and security among Allies weakens NATO’s unity and
solidarity. In order to maintain cohesion and the ability to undertake collective military action, NATO
will place greater emphasis on joint exercises (including those based on Article 5 scenarios), on more
intensive involvement of the allied rapid reaction forces and the US forces in Europe in such exercises,
and on common defence capability development projects.

10. The economy of the Czech Republic and the majority of the Allies will, in the near future, continue to cope
with the consequences of the economic, financial and debt crises. This reality calls for greater efficiency
in spending the resources necessary for the sufficient national defence capability of the Czech Republic
and for streamlining the organisational structures of the Ministry of Defence. That inevitably entails
higher risks and associated responsibilities for possible consequences of an imbalanced development
in the spectrum of military capabilities of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic. In this context, the risk
of a resource, organisational and personnel destabilisation of the Czech Republic’s National Defence
System cannot be underestimated. Such destabilisation would result in deterioration of the quality
of military personnel, decline of the prestige of the military profession, erosion of national military
capabilities and weakening of the credibility and political weight of the Czech Republic.

11. To maintain and develop defence capabilities, multinational solutions can be sought through NATO’s

_Smart Defence and the EU’s Pooling and Sharing initiatives – particularly within the framework of regional_
cooperation, through closer coordination of defence planning and common development of military
capabilities. International initiatives provide opportunities for the Czech Republic to maintain specific
military capabilities; however, they cannot substitute for the primary responsibility of the state
for national defence and development of its own defence potential.

#### C. Three Pillars 
### of Czech National Defence: 

##### The State – The Armed Forces – The Citizen

12. The defence of the Czech Republic is based on a responsible approach by the Government and
other state administration authorities in order to provide a functional National Defence System,
on the development of necessary defence capabilities in the framework of NATO’s collective defence,
and on the involvement of citizens in defence in case of a serious threat to the country.

###### Pillar 1 – Responsible Approach by the State to the Defence  of the Czech Republic and Commitments to Allies

13. _Defence of the Czech Republic’s territory:_ The responsibility for the defence of the state territory,
its democratic system, citizens and their rights and freedoms is vested with the Government of the Czech
Republic. At the same time, defence is the concern of all bodies and components of the state
administration, regional and local governments, legal entities and citizens. The Government of the Czech
Republic guarantees that the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic meet the requirements for defending
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state within the framework of NATO’s collective defence.

14. _Collective defence: To safeguard its defence, the Czech Republic creates favourable conditions for meeting_
the requirements identified for the Czech Republic within the framework of the NATO Defence Planning
Process (NDPP) and provides capacity for the reception and support of Allied forces on its territory.
The measures planned to ensure national defence will be regularly tested through exercises involving
crisis management bodies at home and on the international level.

15. _National Defence System: The National Defence System is a part of the Security System of the Czech_
Republic as defined in the _Security Strategy of the Czech Republic. The core function of the National_
Defence System is to prepare, manage, coordinate and support the activities of relevant authorities, forces
and assets in ensuring the defence of the Czech Republic, including early identification and prediction
of the development of threats and their assessment. The National Defence System is intertwined
with NATO’s environment. Control over the National Defence System is exercised by the President
of the Czech Republic, the Parliament of the Czech Republic, the Government with its relevant working
bodies, Ministries, and other central administrative authorities. The Ministry of Defence is responsible


-----

for the process of planning of national defence and coordinates the implementation of planned measures.
During a state of national emergency or a state of war, special structures are formed to provide direct
control over national defence. The Armed Forces serve as the principal executive element of the National
Defence System, in conjunction with other state administration, regional and local government bodies
as well as legal entities and individuals to the extent defined by law.

16. _Defence planning:_ An efficient and effective development of defence capabilities is ensured through
a rigorous prioritisation within the Czech Republic’s and NATO’s defence planning process.

17. _Intelligence: Up-to-date, independent, multi-sourced and unbiased intelligence is an indispensable_
element in the planning and development of an effective National Defence System. Such intelligence
creates favourable conditions for early warning against security threats, for preventing them from
materialising and for activation of the National Defence System.

18. _Resources: Predictable and adequate appropriations for the development of defence capabilities are_
a key prerequisite for an effective and efficient national defence. The Government is expected to stabilise
the defence budget of the Czech Republic for at least the medium term. With its resources, the Czech
Republic contributes to the build-up of common capabilities for allied collective defence, particularly
of systems where the national acquisition and operation are not financially and technically feasible
for the Czech Republic alone (e.g. AWACS[4], AGS[5], missile defence).

19. _Defence industry: The Ministry of Defence supports the preservation of specific military and otherwise_
irreplaceable capacities of industrial production, and research and development in the Czech Republic,
particularly within state enterprises established by the Ministry of Defence. Support of the domestic
defence industry is driven by essential security interests of the Czech Republic with the aim of retaining
the development of key capabilities and traditional know-how of the Czech defence industry sector,
and using the instruments of international cooperation in the areas of research, development and
acquisitions.

20. _Regional cooperation: The Czech Republic fosters bilateral and multilateral defence relations,_
particularly with neighbouring countries and in the framework of regional cooperation, especially
within the Visegrad group. Regional cooperation shall generate improvements in military capabilities
as well as savings.

21. _Comprehensive approach: The Czech Republic develops the ability of the Armed Forces, other_
state administration bodies and the civilian sector to collaborate in the framework of the so-called
comprehensive approach to international peace and security support operations and civil-military
missions.

###### Pillar 2 – Capable Armed Forces

22. The primary task of the Armed Forces is to prepare for the defence of the Czech Republic and to defend
it against external attack.[6 ] This involves activities related to the defence of:

a. the Czech Republic’s territory;

b. the Czech Republic’s airspace;

c. critical defence infrastructure.

23. I n accordance with Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic also
participate in preparations for the collective defence of NATO members’ territories, by means of exercises,
the NATO Defence Planning Process and participation in multinational operations abroad.

24. The Armed Forces of the Czech Republic perform missions in the framework of the NATO Integrated Air
Defence System using their own supersonic fighter capability.

25. The Armed Forces of the Czech Republic are capable of conducting missions autonomously as well
as in cooperation with Allies, including drawing on host nation support on Allies’ territories and
providing host nation support on its own territory.

26. I n multinational operations abroad, the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic cooperate with allied
armed forces on the basis of international treaties and commitments. Outside the territory of the Czech
Republic, the Armed Forces shall be deployed in the framework of a broader effort by the international
community and in accordance with the principles of international law. The Armed Forces are capable
of participating in peace enforcement, peace support or peacekeeping operations and post-conflict
stabilisation and reconstruction missions. In addition, the personnel of the Armed Forces of the Czech
Republic may also perform tasks as part of humanitarian missions, rescue and evacuation efforts and
take part in additional civilian operations and observer missions led by international organisations.

27. U nits of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic are regularly assigned to the high readiness stand-by
formations of NATO (NATO Response Force, NRF) and the EU (EU Battle Group, EU BG). Selected units
are affiliated with NATO multinational corps on a long-term basis. Personnel of the Armed Forces
of the Czech Republic serve tours as staff members at multinational headquarters.

28. The Armed Forces of the Czech Republic may support national civilian authorities on the state’s
territory in the framework of the Integrated Rescue System (IRS), particularly in the consequence
management of large-scale natural disasters and industrial or environmental incidents. In cases
when the internal security and security of citizens are under serious threat, the Ministry of Defence
may assign forces and assets in order to support and reinforce the Police of the Czech Republic (PCR).
To that effect, forces are assigned to the extent necessary and subject to their availability. In principle,
the entirety of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic, including the Armed Forces’ Active Reserve
Force, may be used in support of the IRS and PCR.

**6** See Section 9 of the Act No. 219/1999, on the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic.

29. _Political-military ambitions for the development of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic_ provide
the political guidance for the Armed Forces in terms of their development and fulfilment of legal
obligations, the commitments to Allies and possible additional tasks. The development of the Czech
Armed Forces’ capabilities follows the conclusions of the 2011 White Paper on Defence and is determined
by qualitative and quantitative criteria.

30. Qualitative Criteria:

a. _A single set of forces for the fulfilment of both military tasks and in support of civilian authorities_
in non-military crisis situations.

b. _Force effectiveness_ with respect to the missions of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic
within the framework of the Czech Republic’s National Defence System and the most likely
means of their employment while maintaining the ability to respond across a broad spectrum
of operations in a flexible manner.

c. _Force efficiency with emphasis on achieving the proportion of manoeuvre and combat elements_
(60%) to support elements (40%) across all components of the Armed Forces.

d. _Force modularity enabling the formation of mission-tailored task forces based on organic units._

e. _Deployability of forces and their usability for the performance of missions in allied operations_
while at the same time increasing force sustainability in international operations.

f. _Interoperability of forces ensuring cooperation with allies and performance of missions_
in the Alliance’s integrated information environment.

g. _Force specialisation in areas_ with a higher added value, such as defence against weapons of mass
destruction, special operations forces, military medical service, multinational logistics and
helicopter capabilities.

31. Quantitative Criteria:

a. I n case of an armed conflict which threatens the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Czech
Republic, all forces and assets of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic are employed, including
an option to invoke conscription.

b. For NATO Article 5 collective defence, the Czech Republic provides land and air forces earmarked
to that effect in the framework of the NATO Defence Planning Process. Their core element consists
of a brigade-size task force formed on the basis of a mechanised brigade.

c. Subject to a given situation, the Czech Republic is able to concurrently or gradually assign
the following forces and assets for international crisis management operations:

i. a land battalion task force, or an air force equivalent, rotated after a six-month
period[7]; as part of this deployment, the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic are
able to provide a multinational task force command element for up to twelve
months;

ii. a company-size land or air task force rotated after a six-month period;

**7** Operational tours for air force units may be different than six months.


-----

iii. a battalion-size task force assigned for high readiness stand-by arrangements
of NATO (NATO Response Force) or the EU (EU Battle Group).

d. The Czech Republic is also able to contribute to additional operations with specialised forces
or expert teams, including but not limited to the Special Operations Forces and mentoring and
training teams.[8]

###### Pillar 3 – National Defence as Civic Duty

32. National defence is a civic duty and a moral obligation at the same time. The legal duty of citizens
to defend their homeland has not ceased despite the transformation of the Armed Forces of the Czech
Republic into an all-volunteer force. The Government strengthens the citizens’ awareness of personal
responsibility for national defence.

33. I n the context of intertwining internal and external security threats, preparation of citizens for national
defence calls for a combination of military and civilian approaches. This is the guiding principle
for the development and integration of crisis response planning measures and means.

34. Mobilisation is one of the mechanisms for transition from peacetime to a state of war. The Czech Republic
prepares for mobilisation mainly through conceptual measures and it maintains only the necessary
and minimum level of supplies in line with the principle of deferred requirement. The scope, content and
schedule of measures to prepare and implement mobilisation reflect the development of the security
situation.

35. The Active Reserve Force is an effective instrument for citizens to fulfil their right to participate in ensuring
the defence of the Czech Republic in peacetime. It is also a means for the Armed Forces of the Czech
Republic to reach out to the public. In case of need, the Active Reserve Force personnel augment
the manning levels of selected military units.

**8** Forces and assets necessary to fulfil the political-military ambitions are identified in the policy document Struktura a počty ozbrojených sil České republiky v letech
_2013–2015 (Tables of Organisation and Equipment of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic in 2013–15)._


-----

#### D. Implementation

36. The Defence Strategy of the Czech Republic is implemented by decisions of the Government
of the Czech Republic and by means of the ensuing implementing documents under the purview
of the Ministry of Defence. The present strategy will provide the basis for updating the _National_
_Defence Plan of the Czech Republic. The Government is informed, normally on a biennial basis, about_
the implementation of the _Defence Strategy of the Czech Republic by the Report on the Czech Republic_
_Defence, which is also considered by the relevant committees of the Parliament of the Czech Republic._

37. _The Defence Strategy of the Czech Republic_ will be updated after ten years. In case of major changes
to the security environment, the Government of the Czech Republic may choose to review the strategy
earlier.

38. The present document supersedes the Military Strategy of the Czech Republic (2008).

#### E. Conclusion

39. Safeguarding the defence of sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Czech Republic is the primary
function of the state and an obligation for the Government, which shares this commitment with other
state authorities, regional and local government bodies. The defence of the homeland is also a civic
duty.

40. Preparations for national defence and the development of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic
stem from the principles identified in this strategy. Capable Armed Forces of the Czech Republic with
advanced and interoperable military capabilities at their disposal are the key prerequisite for an effective
and efficient national defence system. The Armed Forces’ development is interlinked and coordinated
with other components of the Czech Republic’s Security System. Given the nature of security threats
and the commitments to Allies, the defence of the Czech Republic is not confined to its national
borders; it is planned within the Alliance framework. The Government allocates sufficient resources
for strengthening national defence capabilities. Thus, the Czech Republic remains a sovereign and
responsible state and a reliable Ally in the dynamic 21st century security environment.

**_The Defence Strategy of the Czech Republic was approved by the Governmental Resolution_**
**_of 26th September 2012, Nr. 699._**
