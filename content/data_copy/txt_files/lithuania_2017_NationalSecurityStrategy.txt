Chapter I

**GENERAL PROVISIONS**


1. The National Security Strategy (hereinafter: the ‘Strategy’) represents a set of provisions
defining the development of a secure state. The Strategy stipulates the vital and primary interests
of national security, the key risk factors, dangers and threats posed to these interests, sets the
priorities and long- and medium-term tasks of the development of the national security system
and foreign, defence and domestic policies. The Strategy is based on the Constitution of the
Republic of Lithuania, the Law of the Republic of Lithuania on the Basics of National Security,
treaties of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (hereinafter: ‘NATO’) and the European Union
(hereinafter: the ‘EU’) as well as on the strategic goals and guidelines stated in strategic security
documents of NATO and the EU.
2. The Republic of Lithuania views its national security as safeguarding of interests of
national security. The security policy of the Republic of Lithuania is open, transparent and nonconfrontational. The Republic of Lithuania does not view any state as its enemy.
3. In shaping and implementing national security policy, the Republic of Lithuania acts in
compliance with the universally recognized international legal norms, principles and commitments enshrined in documents of the United Nations Organization, the Organization for Security
and Co-operation in Europe and the Council of Europe, contributes to international peace and
all-encompassing security based on democratic values, law and justice.
4. The national security of the Republic of Lithuania is ensured by its citizens, their communities and organizations, the President of the Republic of Lithuania, the Seimas of the Republic
of Lithuania, the Government of the Republic of Lithuania, the Lithuanian Armed Forces, police,
intelligence institutions and other institutions significant for national security.

Chapter II

**BASIC ASSUMPTIONS OF NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY**


5. National security is the basis for the prosperity of the State. Only a secure environment
is capable of ensuring the functioning of a mature democratic constitutional order, sustainable economic growth, protection of human rights and freedoms, viability of civil society. The
necessary condition of national security is contribution of civic-minded citizens to the country’s
security and welfare, their preparedness to contribute to its defence under critical circumstances.
6. The national security of the Republic of Lithuania is strengthened by NATO and EU membership and the military presence of the United States of America (hereinafter: the ‘USA’) in Europe
and the region. The strengthening of NATO collective defence, the increased military visibility of
NATO and its allies in the country and the region act as a deterrent and a guarantee of security
for the Republic of Lithuania. The EU provides additional guarantees of security and supports
infrastructure projects of the Republic of Lithuania and other states of the region that increase
the economic and energy security of the Baltic States.

7. The national security of the Republic of Lithuania is a part of indivisible security of NATO
and the EU: a threat to one Member State of NATO or the EU is considered as a threat to the
national security of the Republic of Lithuania; therefore, it is affected by challenges to regional,
European and global security. The Republic of Lithuania bases its national security policy on the
values common to NATO and the EU and implements it independently, in co-operation with
other states and through international organizations.
8. In the current period the main threat for the security of the Republic of Lithuania is
posed by aggressive actions of the Russian Federation violating the security architecture based
on universal rules and principles of international law and peaceful co-existence. Aggression
against the neighbouring countries, annexation of Crimea, the concentration of modern military
equipment of the Russian Federation, its large scale offensive capabilities and their exercises
near the borders of the Republic of Lithuania and other states, especially in Kaliningrad Region
(Karaliaučius), cause international tension and threaten world peace. Capacity of the Russian
Federation to use military and economic, energy, information and other non-military measures in combination against the neighbouring countries, ability to exploit and create internal
problems of the states located in the Eastern neighbourhood of the Republic of Lithuania as
well as preparedness of the Russian Federation to use a nuclear weapon even against the states
which do not possess it is a challenge to the security of the Republic of Lithuania and the whole
Euro-Atlantic community. These factors will affect national security not only in the short term
but also in the future.
9. The security of the Republic of Lithuania directly and indirectly depends on long-term
challenges in Europe’s Southern neighbourhood. Growing religious extremism in these regions,
frozen conflicts, unstable states with the power and security vacuum emerged in them create
conditions for the spread of terrorism, uncontrolled migration, organized crime, humanitarian
crises and constitute a serious challenge for the EU unity.
10. Domestic progress of the Republic of Lithuania is necessary for its security and sustainable national development, therefore, social exclusion, demographic, economic, energy,
environmental issues as well as information, cyber and public security are an integral part of
national security.

Chapter III

**INTERESTS OF NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA**


11. Vital interests of the national security of the Republic of Lithuania are the interests which
are safeguarded by employing all lawful means and violation of which would pose a threat to
the existence of the State of Lithuania and its society. The vital interests of the national security
of the Republic of Lithuania are as follows:
11.1. sovereignty, territorial integrity, democratic constitutional order;

12. The primary interests of the national security of the Republic of Lithuania are the interests a
failure to defend which would eventually result in a violation of the vital interests of the Republic of
Lithuania. The primary interests of the national security of the Republic of Lithuania are as follows:

all states of the Euro-Atlantic community;

Lithuania, external and internal, military and non-military threats, dangers and risk factors are
interlinked. Taking into account the changed security environment, conventional military threats

tive external influence and propaganda, lead to distrust of state institutions and the political
system of the Republic of Lithuania. Such trends may create a basis for the development of
radical, extremist movements within the State and potentially destabilise the political system;
14.11. demographic crisis – a decreasing number of the Lithuanian population due to low
birth rates, demographic ageing and the persistently large scale of emigration poses a threat to

the growth of national economy and hamper the attainment of sustainable economic growth
and welfare;

because of natural, technical, ecological or social events, outbreaks of contagious diseases threatening to cause a major danger and threat to the health and life of the majority of the population,

all measures and methods available to the State.
18. Priorities of the national security policy of the Republic of Lithuania and long-term and
medium-term objectives are as follows:
18.1. strengthening of national defence capabilities. The foundation of defence of the Republic
of Lithuania is the ability of the Lithuanian Armed Forces together with its allies to ensure credible
deterrence, and in the case of failure to deter – to defend the Republic of Lithuania individually
and together with allies. The Lithuanian Armed Forces must also be ready to fulfil the country’s
international obligations. The Republic of Lithuania will:

country’s GDP would be allocated in 2018 at the latest, while ensuring steady increase further on;

prompt and smooth deployment of Allied forces in the Republic of Lithuania and their actions
in the territory of the country;

armed forces and the interoperability of institutions comprising the war time armed forces and
