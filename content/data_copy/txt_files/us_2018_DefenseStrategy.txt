**INTRODUCTION**

The Department of Defense’s enduring mission is to provide combat-credible military forces needed
to deter war and protect the security of our nation. Should deterrence fail, the Joint Force is prepared
to win. Reinforcing America’s traditional tools of diplomacy, the Department provides military
options to ensure the President and our diplomats negotiate from a position of strength.

Today, we are emerging from a period of strategic atrophy, aware that our competitive military
advantage has been eroding. We are facing increased global disorder, characterized by decline in the
long-standing rules-based international order—creating a security environment more complex and
volatile than any we have experienced in recent memory. Inter-state strategic competition, not
terrorism, is now the primary concern in U.S. national security.

China is a strategic competitor using predatory economics to intimidate its neighbors while militarizing
features in the South China Sea. Russia has violated the borders of nearby nations and pursues veto
power over the economic, diplomatic, and security decisions of its neighbors. As well, North Korea’s
outlaw actions and reckless rhetoric continue despite United Nation’s censure and sanctions. Iran
continues to sow violence and remains the most significant challenge to Middle East stability. Despite
the defeat of ISIS’s physical caliphate, threats to stability remain as terrorist groups with long reach
continue to murder the innocent and threaten peace more broadly.

This increasingly complex security environment is defined by rapid technological change, challenges
from adversaries in every operating domain, and the impact on current readiness from the longest
continuous stretch of armed conflict in our Nation’s history. In this environment, there can be no
complacency—we must make difficult choices and prioritize what is most important to field a lethal,
resilient, and rapidly adapting Joint Force. America’s military has no preordained right to victory on
the battlefield.

This unclassified synopsis of the classified _2018 National Defense Strategy articulates our strategy to_
compete, deter, and win in this environment. The reemergence of long-term strategic competition,
rapid dispersion of technologies, and new concepts of warfare and competition that span the entire
spectrum of conflict require a Joint Force structured to match this reality.

A more lethal, resilient, and rapidly innovating Joint Force, combined with a robust constellation of
allies and partners, will sustain American influence and ensure favorable balances of power that
safeguard the free and open international order. Collectively, our force posture, alliance and
partnership architecture, and Department modernization will provide the capabilities and agility
required to prevail in conflict and preserve peace through strength.

The costs of not implementing this strategy are clear. Failure to meet our defense objectives will result
in decreasing U.S. global influence, eroding cohesion among allies and partners, and reduced access
to markets that will contribute to a decline in our prosperity and standard of living. Without sustained
and predictable investment to restore readiness and modernize our military to make it fit for our time,
we will rapidly lose our military advantage, resulting in a Joint Force that has legacy systems irrelevant
to the defense of our people.

_Challenges to the U.S. military advantage represent another shift in the global security environment. For_
decades the United States has enjoyed uncontested or dominant superiority in every operating domain.
We could generally deploy our forces when we wanted, assemble them where we wanted, and operate
how we wanted. Today, every domain is contested—air, land, sea, space, and cyberspace.

We face an ever more lethal and disruptive battlefield, combined across domains, and conducted at
increasing speed and reach—from close combat, throughout overseas theaters, and reaching to our
homeland. Some competitors and adversaries seek to optimize their targeting of our battle networks
and operational concepts, while also using other areas of competition short of open warfare to achieve
their ends (e.g., information warfare, ambiguous or denied proxy operations, and subversion). These
trends, if unaddressed, will challenge our ability to deter aggression.

The security environment is also affected by rapid technological advancements and the changing character of war.
The drive to develop new technologies is relentless, expanding to more actors with lower barriers of
entry, and moving at accelerating speed. New technologies include advanced computing, “big data”
analytics, artificial intelligence, autonomy, robotics, directed energy, hypersonics, and biotechnology—
the very technologies that ensure we will be able to fight and win the wars of the future.

New commercial technology will change society and, ultimately, the character of war. The fact that
many technological developments will come from the commercial sector means that state
competitors and non-state actors will also have access to them, a fact that risks eroding the
conventional overmatch to which our Nation has grown accustomed. Maintaining the Department’s
technological advantage will require changes to industry culture, investment sources, and protection
across the National Security Innovation Base.

States are the principal actors on the global stage, but _non-state actors also threaten the security_
environment with increasingly sophisticated capabilities. Terrorists, trans-national criminal
organizations, cyber hackers and other malicious non-state actors have transformed global affairs with
increased capabilities of mass disruption. There is a positive side to this as well, as our partners in
sustaining security are also more than just nation-states: multilateral organizations, non-governmental
organizations, corporations, and strategic influencers provide opportunities for collaboration and
partnership. Terrorism remains a persistent condition driven by ideology and unstable political and
economic structures, despite the defeat of ISIS’s physical caliphate.

It is now undeniable that the _homeland is no longer a sanctuary._ America is a target, whether from
terrorists seeking to attack our citizens; malicious cyber activity against personal, commercial, or
government infrastructure; or political and information subversion. New threats to commercial and
military uses of space are emerging, while increasing digital connectivity of all aspects of life,
business, government, and military creates significant vulnerabilities. During conflict, attacks against
our critical defense, government, and economic infrastructure must be anticipated.

Rogue regimes, such as North Korea, continue to seek out or develop weapons of mass destruction (WMD)
– nuclear, chemical, and biological – as well as long range missile capabilities and, in some cases,
proliferate these capabilities to malign actors as demonstrated by Iranian ballistic missile exports.
Terrorists likewise continue to pursue WMD, while the spread of nuclear weapon technology and
advanced manufacturing technology remains a persistent problem. Recent advances in bioengineering
raise another concern, increasing the potential, variety, and ease of access to biological weapons.

**DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE OBJECTIVES**


ed to defend the In support of the National Security Strategy, the Department of Defense will be prepared to defend the

of power remain homeland, remain the preeminent military power in the world, ensure the balances of power remain

riorities for the Long-term strategic competitions with China and Russia are the principal priorities for the

magnitude of the Department, and require both increased and sustained investment, because of the magnitude of the
hreats to increase threats they pose to U.S. security and prosperity today, and the potential for those threats to increase

er rogue regimes in the future. Concurrently, the Department will sustain its efforts to deter and counter rogue regimes
olidate our gains such as North Korea and Iran, defeat terrorist threats to the United States, and consolidate our gains

in Iraq and Afghanistan while moving to a more resource-sustainable approach.

nt, and military. power—diplomacy, information, economics, finance, intelligence, law enforcement, and military.

the initiative to More than any other nation, America can expand the competitive space, seizing the initiative to

more lethal force, challenge our competitors where we possess advantages and they lack strength. A more lethal force,

of performance strong alliances and partnerships, American technological innovation, and a culture of performance

will generate decisive and sustained U.S. military advantages.


-----

As we expand the competitive space, we continue to offer competitors and adversaries an outstretched
hand, open to opportunities for cooperation but from a position of strength and based on our national
interests. Should cooperation fail, we will be ready to defend the American people, our values, and
interests. The willingness of rivals to abandon aggression will depend on their perception of U.S.
strength and the vitality of our alliances and partnerships.

_Be strategically predictable, but operationally unpredictable. Deterring or defeating long-term strategic_
competitors is a fundamentally different challenge than the regional adversaries that were the focus of
previous strategies. Our strength and integrated actions with allies will demonstrate our commitment
to deterring aggression, but our dynamic force employment, military posture, and operations must
introduce unpredictability to adversary decision-makers. With our allies and partners, we will challenge
competitors by maneuvering them into unfavorable positions, frustrating their efforts, precluding their
options while expanding our own, and forcing them to confront conflict under adverse conditions.

_Integrate with U.S. interagency. Effectively expanding the competitive space requires combined actions_
with the U.S. interagency to employ all dimensions of national power. We will assist the efforts of the
Departments of State, Treasury, Justice, Energy, Homeland Security, Commerce, USAID, as well as
the Intelligence Community, law enforcement, and others to identify and build partnerships to address
areas of economic, technological, and informational vulnerabilities.

_Counter coercion and subversion._ In competition short of armed conflict, revisionist powers and rogue
regimes are using corruption, predatory economic practices, propaganda, political subversion, proxies,
and the threat or use of military force to change facts on the ground. Some are particularly adept at
exploiting their economic relationships with many of our security partners. We will support U.S.
interagency approaches and work by, with, and through our allies and partners to secure our interests
and counteract this coercion.

_Foster a competitive mindset. To succeed in the emerging security environment, our Department and Joint_
Force will have to out-think, out-maneuver, out-partner, and out-innovate revisionist powers, rogue
regimes, terrorists, and other threat actors.

We will expand the competitive space while pursuing three distinct lines of effort:

 First, rebuilding military readiness as we build a more lethal Joint Force;
 Second, strengthening alliances as we attract new partners; and
 Third, reforming the Department’s business practices for greater performance
and affordability.

**Build a More Lethal Force**

The surest way to prevent war is to be prepared to win one. Doing so requires a competitive approach
to force development and a consistent, multiyear investment to restore warfighting readiness and
field a lethal force. The size of our force matters. The Nation must field sufficient, capable forces to
defeat enemies and achieve sustainable outcomes that protect the American people and our vital
interests. Our aim is a Joint Force that possesses decisive advantages for any likely conflict, while
remaining proficient across the entire spectrum of conflict.

 _Resilient and agile logistics. Investments will prioritize prepositioned forward stocks and_
munitions, strategic mobility assets, partner and allied support, as well as non-commercially
dependent distributed logistics and maintenance to ensure logistics sustainment while under
persistent multi-domain attack.

_Evolve innovative operational concepts. Modernization is not defined solely by hardware; it requires change_
in the ways we organize and employ forces. We must anticipate the implications of new technologies
on the battlefield, rigorously define the military problems anticipated in future conflict, and foster a
culture of experimentation and calculated risk-taking. We must anticipate how competitors and
adversaries will employ new operational concepts and technologies to attempt to defeat us, while
developing operational concepts to sharpen our competitive advantages and enhance our lethality.

_Develop a lethal, agile, and resilient force posture and employment. Force posture and employment must be_
adaptable to account for the uncertainty that exists in the changing global strategic environment. Much
of our force employment models and posture date to the immediate post-Cold War era, when our
military advantage was unchallenged and the primary threats were rogue regimes.

 _Dynamic Force Employment. Dynamic Force Employment will prioritize maintaining the capacity_
and capabilities for major combat, while providing options for proactive and scalable
employment of the Joint Force. A modernized Global Operating Model of combat-credible,
flexible theater postures will enhance our ability to compete and provide freedom of maneuver
during conflict, providing national decision-makers with better military options.

The global strategic environment demands increased strategic flexibility and freedom of
action. The Dynamic Force Employment concept will change the way the Department uses
the Joint Force to provide proactive and scalable options for priority missions. Dynamic Force
Employment will more flexibly use ready forces to shape proactively the strategic environment
while maintaining readiness to respond to contingencies and ensure long-term warfighting
readiness.

 _Global Operating Model. The Global Operating Model describes how the Joint Force will be_
postured and employed to achieve its competition and wartime missions. Foundational
capabilities include: nuclear; cyber; space; C4ISR; strategic mobility, and counter WMD
proliferation. It comprises four layers: contact, blunt, surge, and homeland. These are,
respectively, designed to help us compete more effectively below the level of armed conflict;
delay, degrade, or deny adversary aggression; surge war-winning forces and manage conflict
escalation; and defend the U.S. homeland.

_Cultivate workforce talent._ Recruiting, developing, and retaining a high-quality military and civilian
workforce is essential for warfighting success. Cultivating a lethal, agile force requires more than just
new technologies and posture changes; it depends on the ability of our warfighters and the
Department workforce to integrate new capabilities, adapt warfighting approaches, and change

work capable of We will strengthen and evolve our alliances and partnerships into an extended network capable of

focus on three deterring or decisively acting to meet the shared challenges of our time. We will focus on three

elements for achieving a capable alliance and partnership network:


-----

 _Uphold a foundation of mutual respect, responsibility, priorities, and accountability._ Our alliances and
coalitions are built on free will and shared responsibilities. While we will unapologetically represent
America’s values and belief in democracy, we will not seek to impose our way of life by force. We
will uphold our commitments and we expect allies and partners to contribute an equitable share
to our mutually beneficial collective security, including effective investment in modernizing their
defense capabilities. We have shared responsibilities for resisting authoritarian trends, contesting
radical ideologies, and serving as bulwarks against instability.

 _Expand regional consultative mechanisms and collaborative planning. We will develop new partnerships_
around shared interests to reinforce regional coalitions and security cooperation. We will provide
allies and partners with a clear and consistent message to encourage alliance and coalition
commitment, greater defense cooperation, and military investment.

 _Deepen interoperability._ Each ally and partner is unique. Combined forces able to act together
coherently and effectively to achieve military objectives requires interoperability. Interoperability
is a priority for operational concepts, modular force elements, communications, information
sharing, and equipment. In consultation with Congress and the Department of State, the
Department of Defense will prioritize requests for U.S. military equipment sales, accelerating
foreign partner modernization and ability to integrate with U.S. forces. We will train to high-end
combat missions in our alliance, bilateral, and multinational exercises.

Enduring coalitions and long-term security partnerships, underpinned by our bedrock alliances and
reinforced by our allies’ own webs of security relationships, remain a priority:

 _Expand Indo-Pacific alliances and partnerships. A free and open Indo-Pacific region provides prosperity_
and security for all. We will strengthen our alliances and partnerships in the Indo-Pacific to a
networked security architecture capable of deterring aggression, maintaining stability, and ensuring
free access to common domains. With key countries in the region, we will bring together bilateral
and multilateral security relationships to preserve the free and open international system.

 _Fortify the Trans-Atlantic NATO Alliance. A strong and free Europe, bound by shared principles of_
democracy, national sovereignty, and commitment to Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty is vital
to our security. The alliance will deter Russian adventurism, defeat terrorists who seek to murder
innocents, and address the arc of instability building on NATO’s periphery. At the same time,
NATO must adapt to remain relevant and fit for our time—in purpose, capability, and responsive
decision-making. We expect European allies to fulfill their commitments to increase defense and
modernization spending to bolster the alliance in the face of our shared security concerns.

 _Form enduring coalitions in the Middle East. We will foster a stable and secure Middle East that denies_
safe havens for terrorists, is not dominated by any power hostile to the United States, and that
contributes to stable global energy markets and secure trade routes. We will develop enduring
coalitions to consolidate gains we have made in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere, to support
the lasting defeat of terrorists as we sever their sources of strength and counterbalance Iran.

 _Sustain advantages in the Western Hemisphere. The U.S. derives immense benefit from a stable, peaceful_
