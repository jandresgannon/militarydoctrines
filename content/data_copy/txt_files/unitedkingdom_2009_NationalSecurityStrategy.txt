### Foreword by the Prime Minister

The National Security Strategy provides a comprehensive basis
for planning and delivering the most important responsibility
of Government – protecting our country and our people.

The United Kingdom no longer faces the sort of fundamental
threat to our way of life posed by both the Soviet Union and
fascism at different times in the last century. As an outward
facing nation, we are well placed to take advantage of the
opportunities of the new global age.

But recent events have brought home to us how, in this global age, instability anywhere
in the world can affect our interests and ultimately our security more quickly and in more
fundamental ways than ever before. So we need global responses to global problems
– whether we are facing up to the challenge of a global banking crisis, international
terrorism, or pandemics. The United Kingdom has been at the forefront of developing
these global responses, including at the London Summit in April where decisive British
leadership helped stabilise the world economy and frame a new set of global rules for
the new age.

We also need a strong national basis for our security and prosperity, linking our action
in the international sphere to our action at home. Last March, we set out, for the first
time, a National Security Strategy for the United Kingdom, bringing together the many
important strands of work which Government, its agencies, our world class Armed Forces
and many others carry out to keep us safe and protect our vital interests. I believe this was
an important improvement, but I recognised then that it was a first step in the process
rather than the last word. Therefore we committed to updating the strategy this year.

This update sets out:

�� what we have achieved in the past year;

�� how we have continued to strengthen our approach;

�� our assessment of the challenges ahead; and

�� our response to those challenges – from terrorism and instability in Afghanistan and
Pakistan, to nuclear security, to energy security and climate change, to pandemics, to
failing states and the challenges of strengthening global security through
development.

This report describes what the United Kingdom is doing across the full range of national
security risks. It contains a series of detailed proposals for international reform, together
with realistic plans to deliver them. It shows how our approach to national security is
internationalist, not isolationist; active, not passive; and agile and flexible.

Our approach means we are responsive to new challenges like cyber security. Seizing the
benefits of new technology is vital for our national prosperity. But hostile states, terrorists,
and criminals can all potentially use cyber space to undermine our interests. This could
be at the national level – for example through attacks on our essential infrastructure. But


-----

security threats in cyber space also threaten the interests of businesses and individuals.
In the past, Governments thought about national security as being about protecting
the state and its interests. This remains important, but the nature of the risks we face in
today’s world means our approach to national security must be focused just as much on
protecting individual citizens and businesses. So today, alongside this strategy update,
we are publishing the United Kingdom’s first national strategy for cyber security, to help
people make the most of the benefits of Digital Britain in a safe and secure way.

Our National Security Strategy – and the hard, often dangerous work our dedicated
Armed Forces and others do in putting it into practice – is grounded in core British values
of fair play, human rights, openness, individual liberty, accountable Government and the
rule of law, because we cannot protect our country and our way of life unless we do so
in a way that clearly exemplifies and protects those values.

The Right Honourable Gordon Brown MP

### Executive Summary


###### The National Security Strategy of the United Kingdom

**1.** Providing security for the nation,
safeguarding our citizens and our way of
life, remains the most important
responsibility of government.

**2.** Fulfilling this responsibility requires a
strategic and comprehensive approach.
That is the purpose of the National Security
Strategy of the United Kingdom, published
for the first time last year, under the title
_Security in an Interdependent World._
At that time, the Government recognised
that the fast changing nature of the
security challenges we faced required an
ongoing evolution and adaptation of our
approach, as well as a dynamic and hardheaded assessment of the strategic threats
faced by the UK. For these reasons, as well
as to provide a progress report on the
national security commitments already
made, the Government committed to
presenting regular updates of the Strategy
to Parliament and the public. This paper,
_Security for the Next Generation, is the first_
such update.

###### The strategic context

**3.** In the modern era, governments must
adapt their approach to national security to
reflect the way in which our understanding
of it has changed. There have been rapid
and profound changes to the international
landscape, including the security
landscape, since the end of the Cold War.
Much of this has been positive. The UK no
longer faces an existential threat from a
hostile, state-backed ideology with the
capacity to destroy our way of life.

**4.** No state directly threatens the UK at
present. Nor is there any sustained global
challenge to the liberal, market-oriented
vision of a free society championed by the


UK and our key allies. Over the past two
decades, the opening up of world markets
and the technological advances in
communications have delivered significant
benefits to the UK with wider choices of
goods and services, considerable increases
in capital flows and trade opportunities,
and internationally, increased productivity
and millions lifted out of poverty.

**5.** But this increasingly complex and
unpredictable international landscape has
also provoked new security challenges.
These challenges have transformed our
way of understanding national security,
away from the traditional focus of threats
to the state and its interests from other
states. These are still important. But over
the past twenty years, the focus has shifted
to a diverse but interconnected set of
threats and risks to the UK and our
citizens, both directly and through wider
international instability. These include
international terrorism, weapons of mass
destruction, conflicts and failed states,
pandemics and trans-national crime. The
scope of the National Security Strategy of
the United Kingdom therefore reflects the
broader demands of the global age.

**6.** Over the past year, the banking crisis and
the ensuing synchronised global economic
downturn has shaken confidence in the
rapid process of globalisation and increasing
interdependence seen over the past twenty
years. Economic downturns inevitably lead to
a cyclical slowdown in cross-border economic
activities such as trade and foreign direct
investment. But the magnitude of the current
crisis and its rapid transmission across
borders raises the risk that there will be a
change in attitudes towards globalisation,
and a less permissive environment may result
going forwards. Regrettably, protectionist
measures have already been taken in some
countries. The Government firmly believes


-----

that open international markets for products
and services will maximise welfare for all
countries. We are working with our partners
to mitigate the risks to globalisation in
forums such as the World Trade Organisation
(WTO), the European Union (EU), and the
Group of Twenty (G20) Finance Ministers and
Central Bank Governors.

**7.** The truly global nature of the crisis has
emphasised the integration and
interdependence of all countries into the
world economy. This has demonstrated the
need for policy responses coordinated
across a wide range of countries. The
prominent role the G20, made up of both
advanced and emerging economies, has
played is a direct consequence of this.

**8.** Prosperity and financial stability are
critical for security and so we have
undertaken in-depth analysis to better
understand the potential implications of
the economic downturn for our national
security. Our conclusion is that the crisis has
not fundamentally altered our assessment
of key security threats. That is not to say
that it has had no impact. The downturn
has increased the risk that fragile states and
regions become more fragile, and the risk
that poverty acts as a driver of insecurity at
a global level. And whilst there has been
welcome progress, including at the London
Summit, it is important that we continue to
commit to addressing global risks arising
from climate change and other drivers. We
must also take decisive action to make sure
that the multilateral commitment necessary
to tackle these security challenges does not
falter as countries seek to recover from the
downturn. Most importantly, the economic
downturn has provided new impetus for
vital reform of the international rules-based
system, and the Government is committed
to leading this crucial process.


**9.** The threat from international terrorism
to the UK and our interests overseas
remains severe, and although significant
progress has been made in weakening the
capability of international terrorist
networks, continuing serious terrorist
attacks across the globe show the ongoing
potency of this threat. There also remains a
threat to the UK from small, dissident Irish
republican groups opposed to the political
settlement endorsed by the people of
Northern Ireland.

**10.** South Asia continues to be a region of
crucial security concern to the UK. Of the six
major sources of threat identified in this
strategy, Afghanistan and Pakistan are
relevant to at least four: terrorism, conflict,
trans-national crime and, because Pakistan
is a nuclear state, weapons of mass
destruction. The stability of Pakistan and
Afghanistan are interlinked. The past year
has seen a significant shift in the patterns of
instability in the region. The Taliban
insurgency in Pakistan has reached new
levels of intensity and violence, with a sharp
increase in attacks beyond the border
region. Equally significant has been the
response of the Government of Pakistan,
which has engaged in major military
operations against the Taliban. Although
these have weakened the Taliban, the
consequential internal displacement of
millions of ordinary Pakistanis is a
multifaceted security concern in itself.
The UK has committed £22 million to the
provision of humanitarian aid in response.

**11.** It has become increasingly clear that
a regional approach is necessary if the
international community is to find
enduring solutions to the difficulties of
both Afghanistan and Pakistan; this is
reflected in both the UK’s joint policy in
Afghanistan and Pakistan (published in
April)[1] and the approach being adopted by
the United States.

http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/reports/afghanistan_pakistan.aspx


-----

**12.** The international community has also
needed to work together to tackle threats
as diverse as the attempts by North Korea
and Iran to acquire nuclear weapons
capabilities, and to combat a potentially
very serious outbreak of pandemic ‘flu.

**13.** Across many of these challenges there
has been a welcome impetus from the new
United States Administration. The United
States continues to provide the largest
share of the NATO led presence to stabilise
Afghanistan, and committed additional
troops to the country in February 2009.
The new Administration has worked hard
to build strong alliances with partners
across the globe and use its position as the
sole world superpower constructively. This
‘smart power’ concept has seen a fresh
commitment to the global international
framework, human rights, in taking a
strong stand against torture, and the
importance of international development
for both global prosperity and stability. The
United States has made a fresh attempt to
make vital progress in the Middle East, and
has provided new leadership on climate
change, working with the UK and other
partners.

**14.** The UK will continue to take a leading
approach in multilateral responses to key
issues, building on the success of the G20
Presidency and our ongoing central role in
driving international progress on climate
change.

###### National Security – The Government’s approach

**15.** The National Security Strategy of the
United Kingdom is designed to meet the
challenges posed by this strategic context.
It includes:

�� **Our vision of national security: our**
vision is to protect the UK and its
interests in order to enable its people to
go about their lives freely and with
confidence.


�� **Our guiding principles: the UK’s**
approach to national security is rooted
in our core values. These include human
rights, the rule of law, legitimate and
accountable government, justice,
freedom, tolerance and opportunity for
all. We will be hard-headed about the
risks, our aims and capabilities, and will
work with partners at home and abroad
wherever possible.

�� **Our strategic framework: our**
comprehensive, strategic approach
means:

– we will tackle national security
challenges at source by identifying
**why there are challenges to national**
security – the drivers – and what we
can do to mitigate these;

– we will also tackle who or what is
threatening UK interests and citizens
– the threat actors – and frame the
policy response appropriately;

– we will ensure we have the
capabilities to tackle security threats
no matter how they arise – the
various means or domains in which
threats can manifest themselves.
These go beyond the traditional
military domains of land, sea and air,
to include weapons of mass
destruction, and the increasing
importance of cyberspace; and

– our response will draw on a wide
range of better integrated
**capabilities – including our Armed**
Forces, law enforcement, security
and intelligence agencies, diplomatic
capabilities, and international
development activity.

�� **Our position in the world and our**
**interests: the UK is an open, pluralist**
democracy based on the rule of law. It is
historically internationalist in outlook
and is a hub for global activities. We are


-----

a key part of critical alliances like the
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
(NATO) and the EU, as well as a
permanent member of the United
Nations Security Council. International
security cannot therefore be separated
from domestic security and the UK has
genuinely worldwide interests. All of
these have implications for our national
security outlook.

�� **Our planning assumptions for**
**national security activity: to plan our**
national security responses effectively
we must make robust, hard-headed
assumptions about the threats we face.
_Security for the Next Generation brings_
together, for the first time, these
assumptions in one place. They include
assumptions around all of the drivers,
threat actors, and domains outlined in
our strategic framework.

�� **How we are organised: the disparate**
nature of the threats we face requires
an integrated and flexible response.
_Security for the Next Generation also_
outlines where in Government the lead
responsibility for tackling each national
security threat or driver is held. We have
strengthened the role of expert external
advice through the National Security
Forum and are enhancing Parliamentary
accountability through a new Joint
Committee on the National Security
Strategy.

###### Tackling the drivers of insecurity

**16.** The Strategy outlines how we are
tackling those factors which provoke
challenges to our national security, what
we have done to address these, and our
future plans.


###### Global trends – the economy, technology, demography and migration

**17.** Global trends impact upon and define
the strategic context within which we work
to protect our citizens and interests. Key
global developments impact more quickly
and more profoundly on the UK than ever
before. As we have seen over the past year,
trends in the global economy can rapidly
and dramatically affect the whole world.
Technology, and particularly the growth of
the Internet, has changed the nature of
interaction between and within countries
and regions: the barriers to communication
and commerce globally have been
dramatically reduced. Migration trends will
continue to be affected by global
economic inequality and other factors,
such as climate change. While we have
benefited from globalisation, it has also
created a series of challenges to which the
Government’s response is hard-headed in
its commitment; thorough in its analysis;
and internationalist in its approach.

###### Climate change

**18.** Climate change will increasingly be a
wide-ranging driver of global insecurity. It
acts as a threat-multiplier, exacerbating
weakness and tensions around the world.
It can be expected to worsen poverty, have
a significant impact on global migration
patterns, and risk tipping fragile states into
instability, conflict and state failure. From a
security perspective, it is important to act
now to reduce the scale of climate change
by mitigation, such as emissions reduction,
and by being able to adapt to climate
change that is now already unavoidable.
The Government is determined to play a
leading role and, over the past year, the
Climate Change Act has come into force,
setting a legally binding target to reduce
the UK’s emissions by at least 80 per cent
by 2050, from 1990 levels, and introducing
the world’s first carbon budgets.


-----

**19.** The coming six months are a critical
window of opportunity. The UK has already
led the way multilaterally in securing EU
agreement to reduce emissions by 20 per
cent by 2020. It is vital that the world
reaches an ambitious global deal on
climate change in the multilateral
Copenhagen negotiations in December
2009. The Government places the highest
priority on these talks and will publish its
priorities for negotiations shortly. The
forthcoming National Strategy for Climate
and Energy will set out a comprehensive
set of policies to meet the UK’s carbon
budgets and to cut emissions by more than
a third by 2020. The Government will also
shortly publish a paper on International
Development, Building Our Common
_Future, which will include plans to support_
developing countries to prepare for the
impacts of climate change by building their
resilience and adaptive capabilities.

###### Competition for energy

**20.** Global energy demand, on the basis of
governments’ existing policies, is forecast
to increase by around 45 per cent between
2006 and 2030[2]. Internationally,
competition for energy and other resources
can act as a driver of insecurity in a
number of ways: through fostering
increased state-led competition for
resources; through increasing the
economic and political leverage of
producer states; and through tension
arising from exploitation of resources as a
source of internal instability. The
Government recognises the importance of
tackling these issues. For example, over the
past year we have worked with countries
like Nigeria to help tackle the role that
tensions linked to energy exploitation play
in instability and conflict in the Delta, and,
at the London Energy Meeting in


December 2008, the UK secured wide
international agreement for measures to
enhance oil market transparency and
reduce price volatility. We will look to
develop this work further over the coming
months, including calling for greater, more
rapid progress on work coming out of the
London Energy Meeting.

**21.** The Government’s National Strategy
for Climate and Energy will be published
shortly and will set out more clearly the
Government’s strategic role in ensuring
energy supply in a dynamic market in the
context of tackling climate change.

###### Poverty, inequality and poor governance

**22.** Over one billion people live on less
than $1.25 a day[3]. Poverty, inequality and
poor governance can exacerbate the
impact of violent conflict, organised crime,
and terrorism, among other factors, and
can inhibit an effective response to these
threats. This means that vulnerable, fragile
states and systemic global poverty have
implications for UK national security,
whether manifested in the form of illegal
weapons smuggling by organised
criminals, or the threat from terrorism.

**23.** The UK is a world leader in
international development. The level of
Overseas Development Aid as a proportion
of national income has risen steadily from
0.36 per cent in 2007 to 0.43 per cent in
2008, rising towards the 0.7 per cent target
by 2013[4]. Tackling poverty is essential for
global security, as well as being a
worthwhile investment in its own terms. In
line with our commitment to tackling
security challenges early, the Department
for International Development (DFID) is
looking at ways to increase development

-----

assistance to fragile states and regions
where links between insecurity, poverty and
conflict are strongest.

###### Ideologies and beliefs

**24.** Ideology has long been recognised as
a factor that can influence security threats.
For much of the twentieth century the UK
faced serious threats from potent, state
backed ideologies, first Nazism, and later
communism.

**25.** In the modern age, ideology can still
provoke unrest within and across borders,
and our strategy recognises ideology as a
driver of instability. It is a particularly
important driver of both international and
domestic terrorism. That is why the
Government is committed to promoting our
values of justice, tolerance and the rule of
law at home and abroad, and challenging
those who, for ideological reasons, promote
extremist views which can incite criminal and
violent activity, whether they are for religious,
ethnic, nationalistic or other reasons.

###### Addressing the threat actors

**26.** As well as addressing these drivers of
instability, in the National Security Strategy
the Government has developed a
comprehensive view of potential national
security threats and who or what can pose
such threats. These comprise a mixture of
human and natural factors, as well as
activity by state and non-state actors. It is
important to tackle all relevant threats.

###### State-led threats to the UK

**27.** While it remains our assessment that
no state has both the intent and capability
to threaten the UK militarily, history has
shown how difficult it can be to predict the
nature of conflict and so we cannot rule
out the re-emergence of such a threat in
the future. Given the continuing risk posed
by proliferation and the certainty that a
number of other countries will retain
substantial nuclear arsenals, it would be


premature to judge that a nuclear threat to
our national security will not arise over the
longer term. As a result, a minimum
strategic deterrent capability is likely to
remain a necessary element of our national
security for the foreseeable future.

**28.** Instead of taking offensive military
action, a hostile state may be more likely to
seek to threaten our way of life by nonmilitary means, for example, by disrupting
or denying access to critical services, such
as energy supply, causing sudden or
malicious damage to our economic
infrastructure, or sponsoring terrorism in
the UK or against UK interests overseas.
The threats we face are diversifying.

**29.** The Government will maintain a broad
range of military, intelligence, diplomatic
and other capabilities to ensure that we
are well placed to counter any future state
led threats, wherever and however they
manifest themselves. As a result of the
strategic approach taken in this strategy
we will strengthen, in particular, the
mechanisms for collective analysis and
decision taking across government to
integrate further our response to the
changing nature of non-military state-led
threats.

###### Global instability and conflict, and failed and fragile states

**30.** It is not just competent states with
malign intent that can threaten the UK and
our allies. Threats can emerge from failing
and fragile states, which provide
uncontrolled spaces in which terrorism and
organised crime may flourish, such as
occurred in the past when Al Qa’ida grew
under the Taliban regime. They can also
allow the transition of terrorist groups into
larger and more ambitious insurgent
organisations and cause significant internal
population displacement and migration.

**31.** Our response has to be rooted in
helping states and the societies within


-----

them become more secure, with sound
infrastructure, capable and responsive
government, and the rule of law. For
example, the UK-led joint military-civilian
Provincial Reconstruction team in Helmand,
which has doubled the number of
deployed civilian experts in the past year, is
focused on building Afghan capacity across
roads, power, local governance, policing
and informal justice systems. The
Government’s enhanced Stabilisation Unit[5]
is facilitating the planning and delivery of
this in a range of key target countries,
through both bilateral and multilateral
cooperation. By the end of 2009 we will
have established a one thousand strong UK
civilian standby capability from which to
deploy in support of stabilisation and
conflict prevention in priority areas.
Afghanistan and Pakistan remain critical.
The Government’s strategy for this region,
published in April, set out clearly how we
are supporting the development of sound
government and a strong society.

###### Terrorism

**32.** Terrorism remains a constant and direct
threat to the UK and our people. Since the
publication of Security in an Interdependent
_World, there have been three deaths within_
the UK directly caused by terrorist activity.
These were the actions of small groups of
dissident Irish republicans, rather than
international terrorism inspired by Al Qa’ida
and its affiliates. However, international
terrorism continued to be a threat. There
were major attacks in a number of
countries, notably in India and Pakistan, and
Al Qa’ida inspired terrorism is believed to
have been responsible for the murder of a
British citizen in Mali.


**33.** There is no single source of terrorism
and we must be alert and ready to respond
to terrorism in whatever form it takes.
Within Northern Ireland the Government
continues to work with local political
leaders to strengthen the political and
democratic processes, and empower the
Executive further through the planned
devolution of policing and justice.

**34.** Currently, Al Qa’ida and its affiliates
remain the pre-eminent threat to the UK
and our allies. But Al Qa’ida is not winning
and may not survive in its current form.
The Government’s response to the threat
from international terrorism, the CONTEST
strategy[6], was revised in March this year
and is regarded as one of the most
comprehensive and effective responses to
terrorism anywhere in the world. It has
greatly improved our ability to address the
underlying causes of violent extremism,
detect and disrupt terrorist networks,
protect our people and the structures
which underpin their daily lives, and to
manage the consequences of attacks
should they happen in the future.

###### Trans-national Organised Crime

**35.** The estimated global cost of organised
crime stands at approximately one trillion
pounds.[7] Within the UK, the Government
estimates that over £20 billion of social
and economic harm occurs as a result of
serious organised crime. Our response has
delivered a number of important successes.
In the past year, for example, we have seen
a record increase in the number of assets
recovered from serious organised crime
networks, over 85 tonnes of cocaine has
been intercepted and new evidence
suggests there has been a drop in street
level purity of cocaine.[8]

-----

**36.** But we must strengthen our approach
further and recognise more strongly the
key international dimension to serious
organised crime. The Home Office will
shortly publish the results of a review of
serious organised crime. This review will
overhaul our international organised crime
strategy, through strengthened governance
and greater interlinking of responsibility
between the activities of the Serious
Organised Crime Agency and the
Government’s overseas network.

###### Civil Emergencies, including pandemics

**37.** The UK continues to increase
preparedness for all kinds of civil
emergencies. The UK is rated by the World
Health Organization (WHO) as one of the
best prepared countries for pandemic ‘flu,
building on the nationwide emergency
response organisation and capabilities
developed in the past few years.

**38.** Fulfilling a commitment made in
_Security in an Interdependent World, the_
Government published, for the first time, a
National Risk Register[9] last year, the first
step in providing advice on how people
and businesses can better prepare for civil
emergencies. Building on this, over the
coming months the Government will
announce plans to strengthen further
corporate and community resilience.

###### Action in the threat domains

**39.** As well as setting out what drives
instability, who or what poses a threat, and
how we tackle these challenges, a key
development in this revised strategic
framework for national security is a greater
focus on how threats can arise. The
Government is committed to tackling
national security in a comprehensive way,
and this is why plans are in place to tackle
the causes of instability, and respond to


those groups who may pose threats. But
we also need to be able to act in all of the
domains in which threats can become
apparent. In the modern age, these
domains are evolving rapidly and so our
response, as elsewhere, needs to be
effective, fast, coordinated and adaptable.
_Security for the Next Generation therefore_
contains new analysis and new responses
in respect of a number of important
domains of security threat and response
activity.

###### Nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction

**40.** The Government remains extremely
concerned by the threat posed by the
proliferation of technologies related to
nuclear, chemical, biological and
radiological weapons. We strongly
condemn the continuation by Iran of its
nuclear activities in breach of numerous
UN Security Council Resolutions, and the
recent detonation of a nuclear device by
North Korea. We will continue to work
with international partners to achieve
universal application of the NonProliferation Treaty and secure the entry
into force of the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty.

**41.** The Government also remains
concerned that nuclear capability or
material could fall into the hands of
terrorist groups. We are at the forefront of
international efforts to ensure the safety of
nuclear material and will ratify the
Amendment to the Convention on the
Prevention for the Physical Protection of
Nuclear Material, and press others to do
so. As a nuclear weapons state we are also
committed to engaging fully with
international partners on global
disarmament.

**42.** But we must recognise the role
nuclear energy has to play in the global
supply of energy, if we are to mitigate the
risk of competition for scarce energy
resources and tackle climate change. That
is why the Government is bringing forward
detailed proposals later this year on how
more countries can gain access to civil
nuclear power in a way which avoids
proliferation, within a strong, rules based,
multilateral enforcement system.

**43.** We will also continue to take a leading
role in international efforts to combat the
spread of chemical, biological and
radiological weapons, as well as
conventional weapons, which remain a
significant concern. The UK led multilateral negotiations to secure, in December
2008, a new international agreement to
ban the use, production, transfer and
stockpiling of cluster munitions.

###### Maritime Security

**44.** The UK has long been a maritime
nation and this domain remains vital for
the UK’s commercial and security interests.
Over the last few months the terrorist
attacks in Mumbai and the increase in
piracy related incidents, particularly off
the Horn of Africa, have increased
international focus on the challenges for
the maritime sector, their impact on global
trade and the rule of international law.

**45.** To address the range of challenges in
the maritime domain, the Government is
launching, under Cabinet Office
leadership, a cross-cutting programme of
work to bring together key elements of
Government and industry in partnership to
tackle the full range of maritime security
challenges. This will build on, for example,
the considerable work the UK is already
leading with EU and international partners
to tackle piracy off the coast of Somalia.


###### Cyber security

**46.** Cyber space is the most important
new domain in national security of recent
years. Cyber space is increasingly vital for
our prosperity and our way of life. There
are tremendous commercial and other
opportunities for the UK’s business and
people. But cyber space is also a domain in
which hostile states, terrorists, and
criminals can operate putting the interests
of businesses and citizens at risk.

**47.** That is why, alongside Security for the
_Next Generation, the Government is_
publishing the first Cyber Security Strategy
for the UK. This Strategy announces the
establishment of an Office of Cyber
Security to provide strategic leadership for,
and coherence across, Government
departments and agencies, a Cyber
Security Operations Centre to coordinate
incident response and monitor the health
of cyber space, and a cross-Government
programme working in partnership with
business, international partners and the
public on cyber security.

**48.** The new organisations will help
citizens and businesses by providing
assessments of risk, plugging skills gaps,
and providing advice so that the UK can
avail itself of the many opportunities in
cyber space set out in the Government’s
_Digital Britain strategy.[10]_

###### Space

**49.** Just as cyber space underpins many
elements of our daily life, space also plays
an increasingly key role in modern society,
and space related technologies are now
critical for many services. Building on what
we have learned from the strategic
approach to the cyber domain, over the
next year we will take forward a strategic
cross-cutting programme between
Government, industry and international

Sport (16 June 2009) The Digital Britain Report.

-----

partners to develop recommendations on
how we can secure the UK’s interests with
respect to space now and in the future.
In doing this, we will seek the views of
National Security Forum (NSF) members.

###### Public opinion, culture and information

**50.** Almost every aspect of national
security has an important information
dimension. In the information age, the
world is increasingly interconnected and
information is instantaneous. The sphere of
public opinion, of culture and cultures, and
of information and information operations
is therefore an important domain in its
own right. This has long been recognised
in both the military and diplomatic arenas.

**51.** The Government is adapting and
extending this approach. We know that
international terrorist groups see the
information domain as an integral part of
their broader campaign, and our response
must counter this. Under the CONTEST
framework, we have established a tripartite Research, Information and
Communications Unit (RICU). Staffed and
directed by the Department for
Communities and Local Government
(DCLG), the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office (FCO) and the Home Office, this
new team ensures that the UK
Government communicates effectively to
reduce the risk of terrorism, providing
communications advice to CONTEST
partners, exposing the weaknesses of
violent extremist ideologies and supporting
credible alternatives. Internationally, we
continue to promote our values of
freedom, tolerance, justice and human
rights. Active international outreach, for
example through the work of the British
Council, is an important strand of this
approach.


###### Internationalism – global responses to global problems

**52.** Cutting across all of these domains, is
our work to ensure fair, clearly understood,
commonly accepted, and robustly enforced
international rules which govern global
activity. Our approach to the global era is
an internationalist one, and we are
committed to working with partners to
develop and adapt the rules based
international system to meet the demands
of the twenty first century.

**53.** Over the past year, the UK has played
a crucial and valued role in helping lead
the global response to the financial crisis
and economic downturn, most importantly
through the London Summit in April,
where countries representing 85 per cent
of global output agreed vital steps to
promote the recovery. A key priority for the
UK’s security and international strategies
over the next decade is to build on this
success and work with partners to ensure
that the framework for international rules
for the full range of global activities are
fair, relevant and enforceable. This will
involve significant reforms to key
international institutions.

###### Conclusion

**54.** Government exists to serve the people
and its first function is the protection of
their way of life. The UK is, in many ways,
safer than ever before and the new, global
age provides many opportunities. But it
also gives rise to newer and more disparate
threats to citizens. These modern
challenges require a broader understanding
of national security and a broader range of
responses.

**55.** And in our response to them, we must
be proportionate in and uphold our core
values, including liberty and the rule of
law. We need to be hard-headed about the
UK’s interests but also recognise that the
varied, interconnected threats we face


-----

cannot be tackled in isolation. Global
problems demand global responses.

**56.** Delivering the Strategy requires a
cross-Governmental approach. The
National Security, International Relations
and Development Committee (NSID),[11]
which includes a wide range of Ministers
and the heads of key security agencies, will
oversee implementation of this Strategy.
NSID takes advice from external experts,
including the National Security Forum.


**57.** _Security for the Next Generation_
develops further the UK’s ground-breaking,
comprehensive approach to tackling
security threats, and to understanding why
they exist, who poses them, and how and
where they can arise. It is a strategic
framework for prioritising the
Government’s national security activity in
the years ahead, and how we organise that
activity, in partnership at home and
abroad, to deliver our response.

#### Chapter 1

### Introduction

**1.1** Providing security for the nation –
safeguarding our citizens and our way of
life – remains the most important
responsibility of government.

**1.2** Fulfilling this responsibility requires a
strategic and comprehensive approach.
That is why last year, for the first time, the
Government published a National Security
Strategy: Security in an Interdependent
_World. This groundbreaking approach to_
tackling security challenges reflected a
profound and developing shift in our
understanding of national security:
broadening the concept beyond the
traditional focus of the protection of the
state and its interests from attacks by other
states, to include threats to individual
citizens and our way of life. That is why the
Government’s strategic framework for
national security covers not just traditional
areas of national security like hostile
military activity, or even new and
developing forms of terrorism, but also
challenges such as climate change, energy
security and competition for resources,
serious organised crime, and major civil
emergencies like pandemic ‘flu and
flooding.

**1.3** _Security in an Interdependent World_
contained our first comprehensive
assessment of the international and
domestic security landscape, which has
changed radically since the end of the
Cold War. In the two decades since then,
profound technological and
communications advances have
transformed the global landscape.
These have undoubtedly created many
opportunities, but also new challenges.
The impact of events in one country or
region is now felt more directly, across


greater distances. Perhaps even more
importantly, the speed at which challenges
in one country or region are transmitted to
other parts of the world has increased
dramatically. Previously confineable threats
to security now have the capacity to
quickly affect citizens in the United
Kingdom and our interests overseas.

**1.4** This means that our strategic and
comprehensive approach must also be a
dynamic approach. As our understanding
of national security has broadened, so too
has the range and nature of our response
to security challenges. Our response to the
challenges of the world today is grounded
in our core values and a hard-headed
assessment of our interests. But our
strategic response must also be capable of
adapting and reacting nimbly to the
challenges of a fast changing world.

That is why the Government committed to
publishing an annual update of the
National Security Strategy. This first annual
update comprises:

�� our assessment of how the strategic
context for our approach to securing
the UK has evolved since the National
Security Strategy was first introduced
last year;

�� our vision for the security of UK citizens
in a safer world;

�� a set of guiding principles for all our
work on security; and

�� a Strategic Framework for addressing
challenges to our security, based on:

– understanding and tackling the
drivers of threats;


-----

– addressing the challenge of states,
non-state actors and hazards which
could threaten our security;

– acting in all the domains through
which threats may manifest
themselves;

– an understanding of the UK’s
position, interests and responsibilities;

– a set of planning assumptions to
guide our security priorities; and

– detailed capabilities and actions to
tackle the drivers, address the
threats, and be effective in all
important domains of activity.


**1.5** Chapter 2 sets out the strategic
context for a secure UK. Chapter 3 sets out
the vision; the guiding principles; and the
framework for our national strategy.
Chapter 4 discusses the UK’s position and
interests, and our planning assumptions for
guiding our security priorities. Chapters 5
to 7 set out the details of the capabilities
we have and the actions we are taking to
address the drivers, threats and domains.
Chapter 8 summarises how our national
strategy will be taken forward.

#### Chapter 2

### Context: The Global Security Outlook Since March 2008


**2.1** This chapter sets out the strategic
context for the United Kingdom’s national
security and the Government’s assessment
of how that strategic context is changing.

###### Security in an interdependent world

**2.2** The UK’s National Security Strategy is
designed to address the challenges of the
global age. The two decades since the end
of the Cold War have seen a profound and
rapid shift in the international landscape.
UK national security in the twentieth
century was dominated by direct threats to
the integrity of the UK as a sovereign
nation of free citizens. This threat –
ideologically driven and existential in
nature – came directly from other states
with competing, totalitarian ideologies:
first, from fascism in the 1930s, and then
from the communist Soviet Union in the
four decades of the Cold War.

**2.3** Since the collapse of the Soviet Union
there has been no direct, state sponsored,
ideologically driven, existential threat to
the UK’s sovereignty and our way of life.
At present no state directly threatens the
United Kingdom.

**2.4** This absence of a competing, state
sponsored challenge to the democratic,
liberal, free market based societies of the
UK and our allies has been accompanied
by a drive towards the opening up of trade
and travel routes. At times this paradigm,
sometimes called the ‘Washington
Consensus’, has seemed to be moving
inexorably towards an ever more globalised
society, underpinned by a rules based
international system. Rapid technological


and communications changes have
augmented this shift, with almost
instantaneous communication rendering
physical distance far less important, and
the faster movement of people, goods and
capital worldwide rendering attempts to
manage strategic challenges at a purely
national level obsolete. The UK, with its
long tradition of facing outwards and
engaging strongly at a multilateral level, is
well placed to lead this more integrated
global response to manage the challenges
of the twenty first century.

**2.5** Many of the features of the new
global landscape are positive and the UK
remains in many ways more secure than
many countries, and more secure than at
most times in our history. But this new
global picture also presents complex,
diverse and unpredictable challenges.
As a nation, we cannot rule out the return
of a direct state threat to the UK, and our
highly trained and skilled Armed Forces are
the ultimate guarantee of the nation’s
security. We also continue to face longestablished but rapidly evolving threats
from non-state actors, notably terrorists,
and the potential threats from terrorists or
rogue states attempting to acquire
chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear
weapons for use against the UK and its
interests.

**2.6** But, as Security in an Interdependent
_World set out, the strategic, twenty-first_
century context for national security is
much broader than these well-known risks.
Global poverty and weak or fragile
governance creates instability, and
sometimes conflict, which can impact on


-----

the overall stability of individual regions
which are strategically important to the UK
and our interests. Competition for energy,
which will be exacerbated over the coming
decades by the impact of climate change,
is a further driver of instability. Climate
change increases the risk of disruptive,
high impact events in other countries and
even within the UK itself. Moreover, those
who threaten global stability – be they
other states, ideologically motivated
terrorists or serious trans-national
organised crime syndicates – can use more
sophisticated means to pursue their
objectives, for example through the use of
cyber space.

###### The security context: the Government’s updated assessment

**2.7** Just as these are global problems that
cannot be dealt with by the UK alone, nor
can the UK’s response rely solely on the
role of Government. And no one part of
Government can unilaterally address
individual threats. The purpose of the
National Security Strategy is to bring
together our multilateral and integrated
approach to tackling security threats, the
forces that drive those threats, and the
means through which they can arise.

**2.8** This national security framework
depends on a timely, transparent and
hard-headed assessment of the strategic
context for national security. That is why, in
_Security in an Interdependent World, the_
Government committed to updating
regularly this assessment of the challenges
we face. This is so that Parliament and the
UK public can see how the Government
assesses the implications of ongoing events
for our strategic response.


###### The global economic downturn and its implications for national security

**2.9** By far the most fundamental change
in the global economic landscape since the
publication of Security in an
_Interdependent World is the global_
financial crisis, and the ensuing
synchronised global economic downturn.
The severity of the slowdown is not
disputed, nor is its reach. The International
Monetary Fund (IMF) now forecasts that
the world economy will contract by 1.3 per
cent in 2009.[12] This is the first full year fall
in global output since the end of the
Second World War. Whilst North American
and European countries were the first to
experience the downturn, its effects have
spread across the globe. Some emerging
economies have contracted sharply, while
some of the larger economies that make
up an increased share of global output,
notably China and India, have seen
significant falls in the rate of economic
growth.

**2.10** This shock to the global economic
system requires Governments to assess
what impact the slowdown might have on
individual national security risks. However,
at the strategic level, we must also analyse
whether the slowdown has altered the
overall strategic international security
context.

**2.11** The economic crisis and slowdown in
the world economy has led to sharp falls in
trade volumes and flows of capital across
borders and of investment in key sectors,
such as energy. Much of this can be
considered cyclical, though it is no less
serious for that. We can expect some or all
of these declines to reverse as the world
economy recovers, but this cannot be
taken for granted. There is already some
evidence of heightened protectionist


12 International Monetary Fund World Economic Outlook (April 2009) Crisis and Recovery


-----

sentiment in some parts of the world. This
is not without historical precedent, as
previous slowdowns have also led
countries to try and protect their own
industries to the detriment of all.

**2.12** The Government firmly believes that
open international markets for products
and services will maximise welfare for all
countries, and the UK is a strong advocate
of international policy initiatives that
contribute to this goal. We believe an early
and successful conclusion of the Doha
round of World Trade Organisation (WTO)
trade negotiations will demonstrate
countries’ collective commitment to the
principle of free trade. Opposing
protectionism has also been an important
part of the G20 agenda during the UK’s
chairmanship this year.

**2.13** The truly world-wide nature of the
crisis has emphasised the integration and
interdependence of countries within a
global economy. This has demonstrated
the need for policy responses coordinated
across a wide range of countries. The
prominent role the G20, made up of both
advanced and emerging economies, has
played is a direct consequence of this, and
illustrates that emerging markets will be
increasingly integral to global policy
decisions.

**2.14** For the purposes of assessing the
strategic context for national security,
the Government needs to assess what
implications this global economic
slowdown has on the drivers of insecurity
and threats to national security. At this
point, any assessment can only be
preliminary, but some conclusions can
be drawn.

**2.15** The Government judges that the
economic downturn has not, at this point,


altered the fundamentals of the global
security landscape and our overall
assessment of the security challenges faced
by the UK. It has not altered the
Government’s view that addressing
national security challenges in the modern
world are driven by a range of factors that
arise as a result of a more globalised and
inter-dependent world.

It is therefore important not to
overstate the impact of the slowdown
on the strategic global security picture.
But some important and subtle shifts are
emerging as a result of the events of the
past year, and the economic slowdown
requires some reassessment of individual
drivers of insecurity. There are three main
areas within the strategic security
framework which reflects the
Government’s preliminary assessment of
the implications of the economic
slowdown.

**2.16** The first, and most important, is the
impetus the downturn has given to more
effective cooperation in global governance.
The post-recovery global order cannot and
will not be a resumption of the
international rules-based system before the
financial crisis and economic slowdown.
The global response has illustrated the
widespread acceptance of the need for
concerted action in international crises.
The broadened scope of the global
response, through the G20 in addition to
the post-war Group of Seven (G7)[13] or
Group of Eight (G8)[14], is a welcome
development. It reflects the Government’s
key strategic objective, as expressed in
_Security in an Interdependent World, to_
see enlarged multilateral mechanisms for
tackling such challenges. The UK is
committed to the further reform of key
international institutions and seeks to

USA, UK and Canada.
14 The G8 is a forum for the governments of eight nations in the northern hemisphere: Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, UK and the USA.


-----

make them more reflective of the twentyfirst century context and thus more
effective in their response to its challenges.
It is vital that these efforts succeed, and
gain wide international support.

**2.17** Second, the National Security
Strategy recognises poverty and instability
as a key driver of national security
challenges, and the most serious risk
arising from the global economic
downturn is an exacerbation of those risks.
The Government assesses that economic
difficulties may increase the fragility of
already vulnerable states and regions. Any
resulting poverty or instability could act as
a driver of insecurity.

**2.18** Third, the Government assesses that
there is a potential risk over the willingness
and ability, at an international level, to
tackle long-term security threats
collectively. This is particularly true of
challenges like climate change. Whilst
some countries have emphasised the
importance of ensuring a low-carbon
based recovery, it remains possible that
other countries may de-prioritise
programmes aimed at mitigating climate
change as they focus on economic
recovery. The same may be true in respect
of development, and conflict prevention
and mitigation. There is also the risk of
heightened resource competition between
states. In terms of our long term energy
security, it is possible that a failure to invest
now both in new and existing sources of
energy as a result of lower incomes could
increase problems in the future, elevating
prices and increasing their volatility.

**2.19** All of these issues underline the
interdependence of both the global
economy and of the security context, and
strengthen the argument for a strong
commitment to multilateralism,
strengthened international institutions and
effective coordinated responses to global
challenges. The Government’s programme


for delivering our response to these
challenges is set out in Chapter 7.

###### The wider strategic security context

**2.20** In addition to the economic
downturn, other events since the
publication of Security in an
_Interdependent World have illustrated the_
unpredictability of the security landscape
that provided the impetus for a strategic
framework for national security. There
remain a series of disparate threats to UK
citizens and UK interests. The remainder of
this chapter analyses some of these key
developments.

###### Terrorism

**2.21** International terrorism, principally
motivated by a violent extremist ideology
remained a threat across the world over
this period. Al Qa’ida and other groups
continue to find sanctuary in ungoverned
areas of South Asia and Africa. And in
November 2008, at least 160 people,
including three British citizens, were killed
in Mumbai, India, by terrorists the
Government believes were linked to
Lashkar e Taiba, a Pakistani based militant
group.

**2.22** International terrorism continues to
pose a direct threat to the UK. The Joint
Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC) has
assessed the level of threat to the UK to be
SEVERE, which means that there is a high
likelihood of future terrorist attacks. In
March 2009 the Government published its
updated counter-terrorism strategy, setting
out a comprehensive approach to tackling
this threat and how it is to be delivered.

**2.23** International terrorism is not the only
threat. There remains a threat from a
number of small, dissident Irish republican
groups opposed to the political settlement
endorsed by the people of Northern
Ireland. In March 2009, these groups were


-----

responsible for the murder of two Army
personnel and one officer from the Police
Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), the first
terrorist murder of a police officer in
Northern Ireland since 1997. These acts of
terrorism are aimed at destabilising
Northern Ireland and its people, and the
new power-sharing institutions they have
endorsed. The Government will continue
to work with the Northern Ireland political
parties to strengthen the political
agreement in Northern Ireland, and over
the past year together we have made
considerable progress towards the
devolution of policing and justice to the
Executive.

**2.24** The UK’s approach to tackling
terrorism, in whatever form it takes,
continues to be grounded in our values,
including the rule of law. We oppose
torture and mistreatment in all its forms,
and as we adapt our legal and operational
framework to deal with changing threats,
so too are we strengthening the protection
of civil liberties and the role of
Parliamentary and judicial oversight in the
protection of individual liberty.

###### Instability and conflict, failing and fragile states

**2.25** The UK continues to play a leading
and active role in tackling conflict and its
causes. This is vitally important not just for
those countries and regions but for our
own interests and security.

**2.26** Progress in Iraq remains vital for the
UK’s security interests, and much has been
achieved. Violence is at its lowest level
since 2003; provincial elections were held
peacefully in January and, despite the
economic downturn, economic growth in
Iraq is predicted to be nearly 7 per cent this
year. Substantial challenges remain, but
Iraq’s future is now in the hands of its
people and politicians. British forces
conducted their last combat patrol in Basra
on 30th April this year. At the request of


the Iraqi Government we shall continue to
support the training of the Iraqi armed
forces and Royal Navy ships will continue
to protect the oil platforms that make a
significant contribution to Iraq’s economy
and thus the country’s long term stability.
Economic progress will help embed security
gains.

**2.27** Over the past year in Afghanistan,
the UK and our NATO-led allies have
contributed more forces, more resources
and more long term aid to help the Afghan
people bring stability and security to their
country. The Taliban continue to threaten
the local population, undermine good
governance and the rule of law, and
collude with drugs traders. They seek once
again to rule Afghanistan, a shift which
would see an increase in the freedom
enjoyed by Al Qa’ida and other terrorist
organisations in the region to operate
training camps and to plan worldwide
terrorist events. But through
the remarkable efforts, and sacrifices,
of our Armed Forces, and as part of an
international community effort, we are
tackling the insurgency and the drugs
trade directly, developing Afghan capacity
and reducing the threat to our national
security.

**2.28** Another illustration of where the
failure of the rule of law in one country
can have profound implications for the UK
and beyond is Somalia. State failure and
lawlessness in that country means that
currently 3.1 million are dependent on
humanitarian relief and approximately
200,000 children are malnourished. It also
threatens global trade, on which the UK
critically depends, through the increase in
piracy witnessed over the past year.
Somalia is also a concern because of the
growing number of terrorist suspects who
travel to the country for training.

**2.29** Conflict continues to have the
potential to destabilise individual regions.


-----

The conflict in Gaza in December and
January emphasised the need for urgent
progress in securing a lasting peace
agreement in the Middle East. The
Government strongly supports the
leadership of the new United States
Administration in their efforts in this
regard.

**2.30** In common with Afghanistan,
Pakistan is relevant to at least four of the
major sources of threat set out in the
National Security Strategy.

�� Terrorism – the senior leadership of
Al Qa’ida remains located in the border
areas of Pakistan and a majority of the
most serious terrorist plots investigated
in the UK have links to Pakistan.

�� Conflict – insecurity in Pakistan has an
impact on regional stability which
affects the UK’s interests.

�� Trans-national crime – an estimated
45 per cent of the heroin in the UK
is smuggled via Pakistan.

�� Weapons of mass destruction – Pakistan
is a nuclear armed state. Its proper
control of its weapons and nuclear
material, and the prevention of
proliferation to other countries and
non-state actors is vital to our interests.

Pakistan currently faces grave security
challenges including a major insurgency
along its border with Afghanistan and a
growing threat from violent extremism
across the country. The economic situation
remains fragile and potentially vulnerable
to further external shocks. Pakistan has
made significant efforts, at a considerable
cost in lives lost, to address many of these
challenges. The UK remains committed to
a long term strategic partnership with
Pakistan grounded in a common desire to
tackle Pakistan’s problems.

**2.31** Since the end of the Second World
War and the inception of the EU and


NATO, old rivalries in Europe have been
transformed into peaceful and constructive
partnership. However, the conflict between
Russia and Georgia in August 2008 was a
reminder that unresolved conflicts on the
EU’s doorstep have the potential to spiral
into military confrontation. These conflicts
can threaten our national and regional
security and have potentially negative
wider implications. With several other
unresolved conflicts in the EU’s
neighbourhood, including Nagorno
Karabakh and Transnistria, the Russia
– Georgia conflict demonstrated the need
for countries to make every effort, through
political dialogue and within international
law, to find a solution to ongoing disputes.
As we have seen with the Western
Balkans, the UK is convinced that closer
Euro-Atlantic integration for countries in
the region, if they so choose, will
contribute to a safer, more prosperous
world.

###### Nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction

**2.32** Over the past year, we have
witnessed the continued risk of
proliferation of nuclear weapons, most
notably from Iran and North Korea. The
Government believes that the proliferation
of nuclear weapons and other weapons of
mass destruction must be addressed
through firm, coordinated international
action. But we must also ensure that
nuclear weapons states keep their side of
the bargain, and that we address the
energy needs, including nuclear power,
of those countries that need it if we are
successfully to tackle the challenge of
climate change. That is why the
Government has committed to setting out
a comprehensive roadmap to nuclear
supply and security issues. The
Government’s paper, Road to 2010, will be
published later this year.


-----

###### Climate change and energy

**2.33** Over the past year, compelling
evidence presented at the International
Scientific Congress on Climate Change
suggests that the impact of climate change
is being realised more rapidly than
previously estimated. There is no evidence,
as yet, to suggest that the economic
downturn has slowed the pace of
emissions growth. But such a slowdown,
should it occur, is likely to have little effect
on the overall rate of climate change. To
meet our ambitious climate change
reduction goals, the Government is playing
a leading role in advance of the 15th
Conference of the Parties in Copenhagen
in December 2009.

**2.34** With regard to energy, the EU’s
vulnerability to supply disruptions was
demonstrated in January 2009 when a
dispute led to a disruption of Russian gas
flowing through the Ukraine and
widespread gas supply shortages. This
demonstrated the need for action at EU
level to improve resilience and increase the
diversity of types of energy, their sources
and routes of supply.

###### Civil emergencies, including pandemics

**2.35** The outbreak of H1N1 influenza in
Mexico in April 2009 caused, within
weeks, a global health emergency with
cases diagnosed in 41 countries within 28
days of the first outbreak. This required a
strong response by governments, working
collaboratively and multilaterally with the
World Health Organization and, within the
UK, the activation of the successful civil
contingencies capability, which is working
with delivery partners throughout the
country to mitigate the impact of the
outbreak.

###### Conclusion

**2.36** All of these events, the continuing
threat from international terrorism; the


wider ramifications of regional conflicts;
continuing attempts by individual states
and non-state actors to acquire weapons
of mass destruction; our better
understanding of the imminence and
impact of climate change; and the very real
threat from the rapid spread of infectious
diseases, demonstrate the
interconnectedness of global security
challenges in the twenty first century, as
set out in Security in an Interdependent
_World last year._

**2.37** These events also illustrate the
importance of concerted global action to
tackle these challenges. Over the past year
this has been particularly crucial in
stabilising and reviving the global economy
following the most severe global downturn
since the end of the Second World War.
Whilst that downturn has neither reversed
the trend towards increasing global
interdependence, nor fundamentally
altered the global balance of power, it has
emphasised the need for broadening the
range of international partners needed to
deliver decisive action. Much still depends
on the leadership of the UK’s closest ally,
the United States, and the Government
warmly welcomes the determination of the
Administration not just to show leadership
on driving economic recovery, but in
working with international partners on key
strategic challenges like climate change
and regional conflict. The Government also
welcomes the Administration’s
determination to make progress in
securing a just and lasting settlement in
the Middle East.

**2.38** This updated assessment of the
context for the UK’s national security also
demonstrates why governments in the
twenty first century need to broaden the
traditional strategic framework for national
security. Chapter 3 sets out that framework
and the vision behind it.

#### Chapter 3

### The UK Government’s Approach to National Security: guiding principles and the Strategic Framework


**3.1** This chapter sets out the Government’s
vision for national security; the principles
guiding our approach; and the framework
behind the United Kingdom’s National
Security Strategy, to address the
challenges of the strategic context outlined
in Chapter 2.

###### The vision for national security

**3.2** In Security in an Interdependent
_World, the Government stated that its_
single overarching national security
objective was:

_“Protecting the United Kingdom and its_
_interests, enabling its people to go about_
_their daily lives freely and with confidence,_
_in a more secure, stable, just and_
_prosperous world.”_

**3.3** This remains our objective. National
security may often require action to protect
the functions of government, but this is to
enable government to meet this
fundamental objective. Protecting our
people’s freedoms includes protecting our
capacity to govern ourselves, and
protecting our democracy and the rule of
law as vital elements of our way of life.

**3.4** Nor is protecting our people all that
government can do to achieve a better
future. The Government has a wider vision
to create a strong, fair, prosperous and
secure society, in which everyone has the
opportunity to live their lives and make the
most of their abilities, with fair chances for
all, and governed by fair rules. This wider


vision embraces a world based on
cooperation between peoples and nations,
with collective responsibility taken for
collective problems, and every nation state,
including the UK, playing its part in
working for this better world.

**3.5** To achieve this future involves all the
actions of government, domestically and
internationally. Not all these actions form
part of this strategy. This update to the
National Security Strategy covers the
protection of our people and our country
from disruptive threats.

###### National security as protection against disruptive threats

**3.6** It is not straightforward to define
national security. Traditional approaches to
national security have focused on military
threats, on espionage, and on other
threats to the state and its interests.
However, the disruptive threats which
could endanger our freedom come from a
wide range of sources. In Security in an
_Interdependent World we committed to_
adopting a broader approach to national
security, considering all those threats to
citizens and to our way of life, including to
the state and its vital functions. Therefore,
in this strategy we include not just the
threat from hostile states, but also nonstate threats such as terrorism or serious
organised crime, and serious hazards to
the UK, such as flooding; not just
traditional areas through which we may be
threatened, such as military action, but


-----

new ones such as cyber space; not just
traditional drivers of threats such as
nationalism or inter-state rivalry, but wider
drivers such as climate change,
competition for resources, or international
poverty.

**3.7** This does not mean that climate
change or poverty are themselves national
security threats in the way in which threats,
such as terrorism, are defined in this
strategy. Rather they drive, exacerbate or
change the way in which threats are
manifested. Nor does it mean that in
responding to these issues, the
Government seeks to address them solely
through a security prism. They are major
global issues and security may not be the
only reason for tackling them.

**3.8** The threats with which we are
concerned in this strategy are those which
have the potential to provide severe and
sudden damage to our people, our
institutions or our way of life. This Strategy
looks ahead and aims to address such
potential threats over the next twenty
years. It does not define longer term trends
as threats. But we recognise the need to
act now to address the impact of wider
drivers of national security, such as climate
change, even though its most serious
impacts may not occur within the next
twenty years. And, in time, any long-term
global trends, such as the gradual
exhaustion of hydrocarbon fuel sources
could become acute enough to constitute
a security threat. We will continue to
assess, through horizon scanning and
ongoing analysis, whether further
refinement might be necessary.

**3.9** What counts as serious enough to be
a national security threat? A partial answer
might be whether the response required
needs to be at a national, rather than a
local or regional level. But a national
security threat is not simply a matter of


scale. For example, while ordinary criminal
violence is not a matter of national security,
a threat to the life of people in the UK
from terrorists, or from an overseas state,
is a sufficient attack on our way of life to
amount to a national security threat.

###### Guiding principles for national security

**3.10** Our work to defend national security
is driven above all by some abiding
principles, as well as by the UK’s interests.
In Security in an Interdependent World we
set out eight principles to guide all our
national security work. They remain vital,
and are repeated here.

�� Our approach to national security is
clearly grounded in a set of core values.
These include human rights, the rule of
law, legitimate and accountable
government, justice, freedom, tolerance
and opportunity for all.

�� We will be hard-headed about the risks,
our aims and our capabilities. We adopt
a rigorous approach to assessing the
risks and threats to our security, and the
options for tackling them.

�� Wherever possible, we will tackle
security challenges early. We scan the
horizon for future challenges, and we
aim where we can to tackle not just
threats as and when they become real,
but also the drivers or causes of threats
before they lead to potential damage to
our security.

�� Overseas, we will favour a multilateral
approach. This is based on our need to
work collectively with partners to tackle
threats that are almost always threats to
many of us, not just to the UK and its
people, and most of which we would
be unable fully to tackle on our own.

�� At home, we will favour a partnership
approach. The range of threat actors,


-----

drivers and domains set out in this
Strategy means that Government
cannot work alone to protect our
people. Our people themselves, through
voluntary organisations, civic society,
private industrial sector and all levels of
government need to work together to
tackle domestic threats and develop our
resilience.


�� Inside government, we will develop a
more integrated approach. This involves
integrating both our domestic and
foreign policy, and integrating different
departments, agencies and areas of
policy in support of joined-up responses
to threats.

�� We will retain strong, balanced and
flexible capabilities. Some of the
capabilities needed for our protection
have to be the responsibility of central
Government: for example intelligence
gathering and analysis, military
capabilities, and our diplomatic
network. These have to be maintained
as effective and flexible, to cope with
the threats we have identified now,
those we are preparing for through our
horizon scanning, and those that might
emerge in the future.

�� We will continue to invest, learn and
improve to strengthen our security. This
Strategy develops and learns from
lessons identified since Security in an
_Interdependent World. We apply lessons_
identified from areas of national security
where our thinking is more mature to
deal with the new or evolving
challenges as they emerge.

**3.11** In this Strategy we develop the
theme of protecting and involving our
**citizens in national security. There are**
many examples of this set out in the
Strategy, including:

�� The priority given to countering
international terrorism, as the most
significant security threat currently
facing the people of the UK, and our
approach, which seeks to engage the
public as fully as possible on national
security issues.

�� The strengthening of our work to
combat serious organised crime,
recognising the harm and direct
consequences that such crime can have
on our people, communities and


###### The Government’s Partnership with Industry

The Government maintains a strong
relationship with the defence
industrial base. This is now being
extended by expertise in other key
areas of national security through its
strategic partnership and dialogue
with the UK security industry including
through the Security and Resilience
Industry Suppliers Community (RISC).

Technology plays a vital role in
countering many of the threats
we face. The UK is a world leader
in the field of security, and has a
long experience of dealing with
a variety of significant security
threats. Our security industry is one
of the most diverse and technically
advanced in the world, with UK
companies – many of whom are Small
Medium Enterprises – producing
innovative solutions and cutting edge
technologies across the full spectrum
of security, covering the protection
of people, assets and critical national
infrastructure.

We benefit from strong partnerships
between the public and private sectors
in the security environment, involving
academia, industry and our security
services. This enables us to respond
quickly to new and emerging threats
in order to protect the UK and our
friends and allies around the world.


-----

###### Ensuring security while protecting liberty

The first principle of this Strategy is to ground all our work in our core values.
These include human rights, the rule of law, legitimate and accountable
government, justice, freedom, tolerance and opportunity for all.

This is fundamental to our approach. We cannot protect our country, our people and
our way of life unless the ways in which we do so are themselves compatible with
that way of life. We are a free people with a proud history of defending and
advocating freedom, building up the rule of law, and extending justice and human
rights. We have worked towards greater tolerance and opportunity for all, and
continue to do so.

All our actions are designed to be compatible with these values. We hold ourselves
to the highest standards, but it is a fundamental challenge facing any government,
to balance the measures intended to protect security and the right to life with the
impact they may have on the other core values. We ensure that the use of any
measure is necessary and proportionate to the risk an individual poses, and that
safeguards are in place to ensure the individual’s rights are respected. Thus all our
actions to protect our people’s security have to be compatible with applicable
domestic and international law, including the European Convention on Human
Rights. This includes the actions of our armed forces, our police services, and our
security and intelligence agencies.

Similarly, in considering measures to protect the public, we take into account rights
such as privacy, freedom of speech, and the right to a fair trial. The compatibility of
all our actions with these rights is challengeable in our courts.

These values also guide our counter-terrorism work, where between 11 September
2001 and 31 March 2008, a total of 196 people have been convicted of a terrorist
or terrorist-related offence, many under the new offences which have been brought
in since 2001. In terrorist trials in 2007/8, over half of suspects pleaded guilty.

Our values govern our engagement with partners abroad, including in the difficult
area of detention. In undertaking this work, we have been absolutely clear that the
UK stands firmly against torture. This is a fundamental principle guiding our
approach and that of those who work to protect us, not just in terms of law, but
also in terms of our values as a nation. In March, the Prime Minister announced that
the Government will publish, for the first time, its guidance to intelligence officers
and service personnel about the standards that we apply during detention and
interviewing of detainees overseas. The Intelligence Services Commissioner,
Sir Peter Gibson, will monitor compliance with this guidance.

Alongside this fundamental UK position, we work around the world to eradicate
torture, including through efforts to strengthen UN and other international
mechanisms, diplomatic activity such as lobbying, and funding concrete project work.

economy, through drugs, violence,
people-trafficking and fraud.

�� The new Cyber Security Strategy being
published alongside this Strategy, gives
priority to ensuring that our people’s
ability to do business, communicate,
learn, and interact socially through the
internet and other networked activities
are secure, and that the risks inherent in
our dependence on networks for the
critical infrastructure that underpins all
our lives are managed.


**3.12** Everyone has a role to play in
building the UK’s resilience. Our continuing
work on community resilience builds on
the established resilience structures
Government already has in place by
helping community groups who want to
do more to prepare for the risks we face.

###### The National Security Strategic Framework

**3.13** Responding to the full range of
modern security challenges requires a
strategic approach. The Government’s
Strategic Framework is summarised in

UK characteristics / interests


-----

**3.14** This strategic framework builds on
and develops the approach set out in
_Security in an Interdependent World,_
where the Government distinguished
clearly for the first time between threats to
our national security, and drivers of
insecurity. In this framework that
distinction is developed further.

**3.15** First, global drivers of insecurity are
the causes, reasons or motivations which
might drive state or non-state actors to
behave in a way which could potentially
damage our national security. The
framework assesses the most important of
these drivers, and prioritises action to deal
with the effects of these drivers, and thus
reduce the likelihood that they will cause
threats. Drivers concern answers to the
question “Why might our national security
be threatened?”

**3.16** Secondly, the threats to our national
security are the people, states or
institutions which could act in a hostile
way to threaten our people and way of
life. They could be established states with a
wide range of capabilities; failing or fragile
states; non-state actors motivated by
ideology such as terrorists; or non-state
actors with mercenary motivations, such as
organised criminals. In addition, there is a
category of threats known as ‘civil
emergencies’ which are disruptive actions
caused by accidents or by the hazards of
nature, such as floods, storms or
pandemics. The category of threat actors
(including Nature and accidents) concern
answers to the question “Who or what
might threaten our national security?”

**3.17** The strategic framework also adds a
third category, of domains of threat: those
environments in which threats may
become manifest. The category of threat
domains concern answers to the question
“How or by what means or where
might a threat to our national security be
manifested?”


**3.18** Our National Security Strategy
concerns drivers, threats and domains.
It includes a comprehensive set of actions
by government: to address the drivers; to
tackle the threats; and to protect ourselves
in each of the domains.

**3.19** This is a wide remit of potential
action. We need to act where we can have
the most beneficial effect, unilaterally or in
partnership. We use our guiding principles,
and our assessment of our interests and
position in the world, to help choose from
the many actions we could undertake. And
our actions must be integrated across
departments and agencies. The framework
provides a structure for organising and
aligning all the many levers of government.

**3.20** The different components of the
framework are frequently inter-connected:
one driver can impact on another driver;
the boundaries between different types of
threat actors can be blurred; and particular
threats can be manifested in multiple
domains, and require multiple tools to
combat them. Moreover, our interests in
advancing our national security are
increasingly inter-connected with the
interests of others.

**3.21** The application of this strategic
framework is discussed in more detail in
later chapters, which set out the actions
the Government is taking to address each
of the important drivers, threat actors, and
domains of national security.

###### National Security in law

**3.22** In setting out this Strategic
Framework for analysis and consideration
of national security issues, the Government
is not seeking to amend the legal
understanding of the term “national
security” as it has been established in
statute and common law.


-----

###### National Security Capabilities

**3.23** Our actions may consist of the
strategic development of capabilities, such
as military, diplomatic or intelligence
capabilities, scientific or technical
capabilities; or they may consist of the
application of those capabilities to
particular situations or issues.

**3.24** Capabilities can be applied to tackle
many threats, and to deal with many
aspects of the framework. For example,
our Armed Forces can operate to address
threats from states, contribute to tackling
civil emergencies; and they can also, as
part of a comprehensive civil and military
approach, contribute to addressing
instability. We aim to develop flexible
capabilities which can be applied to deal
with a wide variety of potential future
threats and in a variety of threat domains.
The Government’s range of capabilities for
delivering our national security include:

�� The Armed Forces;

�� The Security and Intelligence Agencies;

�� Diplomacy; and

�� International Development Activity.

###### National Security Capabilities:  The Armed Forces

**3.25** The capabilities of the UK’s armed
forces are a core element of our ability to
ensure our national security. They provide
the ultimate defence against direct threats
to the UK and its overseas territories, and
they contribute to tackling threats to our
national security overseas by helping to
address conflict, instability and crises across
the globe.

**3.26** Internationally, the deployments to
Iraq and Afghanistan have involved
personnel from all three Services, including


vital support from the Territorial Army and
the Reserves. The current UK contribution
to the NATO-led International Security
Assistance Force in Afghanistan is playing a
key role in the South, the Taliban heartland
and centre of the drugs trade. By tackling
the insurgency and the drugs trade directly
and developing Afghan capacity we are, as
part of an international community effort,
reducing the threat to our national security.

**3.27** At home, the Armed Forces
contribute to security by supporting the
civilian authorities in a wide range of tasks,
including through quick-reaction fighter
aircraft and Royal Naval patrolling of our
territorial waters, disaster relief, search and
rescue operations and support for counterterrorism operations.

**3.28** To enable the armed forces
successfully to deliver these effects, the
Government continues to make a major
investment in our service personnel, their
equipment and the infrastructure that
supports them. This investment includes the
decision in 2006 to maintain the UK’s
nuclear deterrent and major new equipment
programmes, including improved armoured
vehicles for the Army and Royal Marines,
continued commitment to renewing the
Royal Navy, through Type 45 Destroyers,
ASTUTE submarines and the Future Aircraft
Carriers, and investment in new aircraft
and weapons for the Royal Air Force,
including Typhoon Tranche 3 and REAPER
unmanned air vehicles.

**3.29** And the Government has continued
to invest to improve the infrastructure,
accommodation and terms and conditions
for our service personnel. Since the
publication of the Government’s Service
Personnel Command Paper (Cm 7424)[15] in
July last year, we have doubled the Armed
Forces Compensation Scheme maximum

lump sum compensation; provided
partners of Service personnel with access
to the New Deal;[16] and have allocated £20
million for affordable housing. These
initiatives form part of an ongoing
programme of reform.

###### National Security Capabilities: The Security and Intelligence Agencies

**3.30** The United Kingdom has three
Security and Intelligence Agencies (the
Security Service (‘MI5’), Government
Communications Head Quarters (GCHQ),
and the Secret Intelligence Service (‘MI6’)).
They (or their predecessor organisations)
have been at the heart of the national
security effort for 100 years, and are as
relevant today in dealing with threats from
both state and non-state actors as they
have ever been.

**3.31** Although their core tasks differ, the
three Agencies work together
comprehensively, bringing global
intelligence-gathering to bear on problems
affecting the security of UK interests
abroad and at home. They, together with
the wider intelligence community including
the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS) and the
Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), have a
great depth of knowledge on a range of
countries and topics which provides
insights that shape Government policy,
diplomacy, and operational engagement at
every level. Their technical expertise allows
them to develop, and help others to
deploy, robust defenses against physical
and cyber threats to our national
infrastructure and Government services.
Their high-end intelligence gathering helps
the law enforcement authorities deal with
the most serious terrorist and criminal
threats we face as a society.

**3.32** The capabilities of our intelligence
and security agencies are reliant on


continual improvement, as technology
develops. In seeking to ensure that these
capabilities are maintained, the
Government will continue to act
proportionately and to ensure that proper
and effective oversight mechanisms and
safeguards are in place to protect
information and individual liberties.

The communications advances that
are transforming the global landscape are
impacting on our capability to undertake
interception of communications for
intelligence purposes and to obtain
information about communications data
for intelligence and law enforcement
purposes. Maintaining this capability is vital
to achieving our vision for national security
and is the objective of the crossgovernment Interception Modernisation
Programme, led by the Home Office. In
April 2009 the Home Secretary ruled out a
central database of all communications
data and published a consultation inviting
views on other options for tackling the
technological challenge which balance
respect for individuals’ human rights and
protection of the public.

**3.33** It is inherent in the business of
intelligence and security that the human
rights of individuals who are understood to
pose a serious threat to the UK’s interest
are balanced against the rights of society
as a whole to security and freedom. Those
decisions are taken very seriously by
Ministers, and are closely regulated and
reviewed by the Intelligence Services
Commissioner, the Interception of
Communications Commissioner and the
Investigatory Powers Tribunal.

###### The Role of Diplomacy

**3.34** The Foreign and Commonwealth
Office (FCO) runs a global network of posts
in more than 170 countries, and 21


16 New Deal – Jobcentre Plus offers a number of New Deal programmes to help unemployed people, particularly
those who have been unemployed for a long time, people with disabilities and anyone in need of extra help to
find work.


-----

delegations and representatives at
international organisations including the
United Nations, the European Union and
NATO. By strengthening the relationships
on which our alliances and partnerships
rest, the UK’s diplomatic network is crucial
to enabling one of the guiding principles
behind this strategy – favouring a
multilateral approach to national security.
The UK is able to draw on these
relationships to tackle the drivers and
causes of insecurity as they originate
overseas, and to respond to security
threats once they arise.

**3.35** In addition, our diplomatic network
can contribute to national security directly:

�� In the UK’s Overseas Territories – in the
Turks and Caicos Islands, FCO staff
helped lead recovery efforts after the
devastation of Hurricane Ike.

�� On counter-terrorism – launching a
range of capacity-building programmes
overseas as well as driving forward an
outreach programme at home and
abroad. For example, stepping up
efforts to support Pakistan in tackling
the shared threat of terrorism, with a
£10 million package designed to build
capacity to disrupt terrorists and their
networks, as well as to address the root
causes of terrorism.

�� On counter-proliferation – using the
FCO’s global network to ensure that the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review
Conference in 2010 succeeds in reenergising the commitment of the
international community to stop the
proliferation of nuclear weapons.

�� On conflict – reducing the impact of
conflict through the contribution FCO
staff make to the Government’s broader
stabilisation effort in many areas of
conflict. These include Kabul, Lashkar
Gas, Baghdad and Basra.


�� Supporting UK citizens overseas –
following the earthquake in China,
the FCO’s London-based emergency
response team handled calls from
families regarding over 500 British
nationals who might have been
involved. Rapid deployment teams
(RDTs) from Hong Kong and London
travelled to the area to locate and assist
British nationals. RDTs were also
deployed during the Russia-Georgia
conflict and to Mumbai within hours of
terrorist attacks in November 2008.

###### The Role of International Development

**3.36** The Department for International
Development (DFID) is currently working
with other departments to help address
the manifold challenges facing Afghanistan
and Pakistan, illustrating the
complementary nature of development
goals with security interests.

**3.37** The UK aid budget is managed by
DFID. DFID works in 150 countries and half
its staff are based overseas. The primary
purpose of UK development assistance is
poverty reduction overseas and
achievement of the Millennium
Development Goals. DFID works with other
Departments, the governments of
developing countries, charities, businesses
and international bodies, including the
World Bank, the UN agencies and the
European Commission. In collaboration
with partners, DFID helps developing
countries to deliver basic services and
foster sustainable growth to participate
fully in the international economy and,
increasingly, to address the underlying
social and economic causes of state
fragility and instability which threaten the
prospects of the poorest countries. Tackling
these helps to reduce poverty, improve the
lives of poor people and can also
contribute to our own security.

#### Chapter 4

### The UK Government’s Approach to National Security: interests, planning assumptions and organisation


**4.1** This chapter sets out how we apply
the principles and Strategic Framework
discussed in Chapter 3 to the particular
interests and concerns of the United
Kingdom and its people. Drawing on an
assessment of these interests, and our
work on horizon scanning about the future
development of threats and drivers, it
outlines some planning assumptions which
underpin this Strategy and future strategic
work on national security issues and
priorities. Finally, it sets out how the
Government is organised to deliver all the
actions necessary for national security, and
how these actions are integrated into a
coherent strategic approach.

###### The position and interests of the United Kingdom

**4.2** To understand how to protect our
people and our way of life, we need a clear
understanding of our position in the world,
our assets and advantages, and the
challenges and vulnerabilities we face. This
section sets out a baseline assessment of
some of the key characteristics of the UK,
and some key implications of how we
therefore need to protect our national
security. The challenges – in terms of the
drivers, threats and domains of threat – are
set out in subsequent chapters. In a public
document we will not discuss all of our
vulnerabilities, lest we help potential
adversaries. But within these parameters
we will be as transparent as possible.


**4.3** It is impossible to capture all the
diverse characteristics of our country. But
this section highlights certain features of
particular importance for national security.

**4.4** The UK is a multi-national state
covering the island of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland. Overall, the UK is
relatively densely populated, and we have
limited domestic food and energy
resources. Our economy, the sixth largest
in the world, is based on the import of
primary and manufactured products and
the export of services and high valueadded manufactured products. It is a free
market economy, with a tradition of
openness. We have a pattern of trade that
reaches many parts of the world, not just
Europe, and very large overseas
investments matched by substantial foreign
investment in our infrastructure and
economy.

**4.5** We are a long-established democratic
constitutional monarchy, with a strong
central government and devolved
administrations in three countries of our
United Kingdom. We are part of the
European Union (EU) and therefore share
competence for many aspects of
government action with other member
states and the institutions of the EU.
We have other strong overseas ties and
responsibilities, economic, familial and
cultural, including with our overseas
territories, the Commonwealth, with the
United States and with other countries.
Over 5 million British citizens live overseas.


-----

**4.6** We are one of the few major
European states with a growing
population. An increasing proportion of
our population (8.9 per cent in 2005)[17] is
made up of ethnic minorities, from very
many different backgrounds. Over 4.1
million residents of the UK are foreign
citizens[18]. In an increasingly globalised
world, diaspora communities can
contribute to the UK’s economic and
cultural success.

**4.7** We have a markedly pluralistic society,
with a tradition of open debate supported
by a lively free press, and a very longstanding tradition of the rule of law. We
have a strong belief in values which should
guide our Government’s actions. But we
also have a tradition of individualism which
means that our values and identity are not
easily captured in a single narrative.

**4.8** The UK, and London in particular, is
a hub for a number of global activities:
communications, media (partly because
of the position of English as a world
language), services including business and
finance, education and international
transport.

**4.9** We have strong and well established
alliances and security interests, notably as a
leading member of the EU and NATO, a
permanent member of the UN Security
Council, and as a nuclear weapons state.
We have a strong and enduring partnership
with the United States, and other countries
including Canada, Australia and New
Zealand, in security and other areas. Our
membership of the Commonwealth, which
is headed by Her Majesty The Queen,
provides a forum within which the UK can
engage with a wide range of partners in
different continents. Given our history in
past centuries, our people have often been
more supportive of action, including
overseas intervention and/or the use of


military force, and over the last century, this
has particularly been in defence of our
values and freedoms.

**4.10** What does all this imply for our
national security? As we consider how to
tackle the threats to our national security,
through the Strategic Framework, we need
to bear in mind the following factors:

�� Because our economic interests, our
citizens, and our cultural and familial
connections with other countries are
spread throughout many parts of the
world, we have interests that are
**genuinely worldwide rather than**
local or regional, and we need to be
able to influence events in many parts
of the world, working with partners in
many regions.

�� Given the openness of our economy,
and our dependence on trade from
around the world, and flows of energy,
information, resources and capital, we
need to be able to ensure that these
**flows are open and secure.**

�� But as we cannot secure world trade
and resource flows on our own,
necessarily we must work in
**partnership with other countries, and**
with international institutions, to ensure
that security.

�� The UK’s position as a hub of
international communications, travel
and migration means that it can act as
**a stage where international events**
**can be played out domestically, with**
events in other countries having an
impact on populations resident here.
The growth of diaspora communities in
the UK means that some overseas
conflicts or instability can be felt acutely
at home. Domestic security cannot
**be separated from overseas security**
**issues.**

-----

�� Our role in established international
alliances such as NATO means that,
while there is no discernible state threat
to the independence, integrity or
capacity for self-government of the UK,
we have obligations to other states
which might be more likely to face
such threats, and we have to take into
account possible state threats to
**allies who may be distant from our**
borders.

�� The tradition of open debate, combined
with a robust independent legal system,
means that policies and actions to
protect our national security have to
**command consent, and be**
**defensible to the public as consistent**
with our values, and justifiable legally.
In addition, both the UK’s international
connections and our past can lead to a
public expectation of action on overseas
issues greater than in many other
developed nations. Our inherited links
to other parts of the world, and our
past and recent actions overseas, heavily
influence the perception of UK security
actions now. Positively, this can help us
exercise leadership and influence
beyond our objective power; negatively,
it can limit our influence on some
important issues and regions.

**4.11** All of this means we have a
**particularly large stake in the success**
**of the international rules-based**
**system. We need international institutions**
to be effective, and we need overseas
actors, states and non-states, to abide by
international rules.

**4.12** These factors are taken into account
in assessing what priority we should give
to particular actions to defend our national
security. Given the very wide range of
issues which directly or indirectly affect
national security, there is an equally large
range of actions we could take to protect
it. This hard-headed assessment of our


position, our influence and our interests
helps us prioritise which of those actions
are most important for us.

###### Key planning assumptions for national security

**4.13** Our work to protect national security
rests on the following key planning
assumptions, which are based on our
horizon scanning of possible futures and
our assessment of current and future
threats. We have organised these planning
assumptions by the categories used in the
Strategic Framework described in Chapter
3. Unless otherwise stated they relate to
the next five years. Our horizon scanning
extends to 20 years. On occasions, we
need to plan programmes over even longer
timescales, but that inevitably requires a
degree of caution, given the challenges of
predicting events over those timescales and
the risks of unforeseen strategic shocks in
the intervening period.

**4.14** These planning assumptions are not
intended to be exhaustive. Nor are they a
substitute for more detailed operational
planning assumptions for individual parts
of Government. However, they provide,
within the Strategic Framework for
national security, a basis for informing
strategic planning across the broader range
of the Government’s national security
responsibilities. The planning assumptions
must be, and are, flexible enough to allow
different parts of Government to tackle
different challenges as they arise.

###### Planning assumptions about the drivers of insecurity

**4.15** The National Security Strategy is
based on a set of assumptions around our
more integrated world, where UK citizens
and interests are affected by a more
diverse range of risks. There are therefore
key planning assumptions about global
drivers:


-----

**4.16** **Global trends: the drivers of**
insecurity, security threats to the UK and
how they can arise, and the required
response, will continue to be driven by a
more interdependent global security
landscape:

�� **the global economy: the present**
global economic recession will increase
fragility in the security situation in some
key regions, but will also provide an
opportunity for increased global
cooperation during the recovery and
beyond;

�� **technology: worldwide advances in**
technology will, alongside all their
positive aspects, inevitably bring with
them emerging national security
challenges, for example in cyber
technology and nuclear power;
particularly if they are exploited by
terrorists and organised criminal groups,
or others with malicious intent; and

�� **demography: the world’s population**
will continue its rapid increase, which,
combined with rising living standards
worldwide will increase demand for
food and energy by up to 50 per cent
and water by up to 30 per cent over a
20 year period. This will bring new
challenges for regional stability in key
areas affected.

**4.17** **Other drivers of instability: Three**
of the other key drivers of instability –
climate change, poverty, and competition
for energy – have potential individual
implications for national security and may
exacerbate the risks of regional instability
and conflict:

�� **Climate change: the world’s climate will**
continue to change with increasing global
temperatures and changing rainfall
patterns. Such changes will increase the
risks to human society and the natural
environment with increasing pressure on
health, water resources, agriculture and


human settlements. Over the next twenty
years these effects will be manageable
but beyond that, the risk of dangerous
impacts will increase strongly. We need to
act now to mitigate the most dangerous
consequences and adapt to those we
cannot prevent, because in the longer
term, climate change will act as a global
threat multiplier, exacerbating existing
weaknesses and tensions around the
world.

�� **Poverty: Most developing countries’**
economies will, once the global recession
has ended, continue to grow over the
medium to long term. Development in
countries like China and India will help
to lift millions out of poverty. However,
there may be a group of fragile and
conflict-affected states that will benefit
much less from the economic recovery
and future growth.

�� **Competition for energy: Global**
energy demand will continue to increase
over the next 20 years and competition
for energy and other resources will
intensify. The scope for disputes within,
and between, states could therefore
increase. Continued instability in energy
markets will put increased pressure on
existing resources. If oil demand
increases faster than supply over the
coming months, this could lead to a
tightening of oil markets and potentially
higher oil prices, which could jeopardise
a sustainable economic recovery.

**4.18** **Ideologies: the National Security**
Strategy recognises the potential for
ideologically driven threats to UK citizens
and interests and specifically:

�� **Al Qa’ida inspired ideology: the**
ideology associated with Al Qa’ida will
outlive any changes to its structure. It
will continue to attract support. A small
but significant number of people will
remain committed to violent extremism.


-----

The terrorist narrative will continue to
exploit political events and individual
grievances; and

�� **Other ideologies: apart from this, there**
is at present no other competing world
ideology of sufficient force to drive
national security threats to us, unlike
during the Cold War. However, some
regionally based ideologies may affect the
UK through our role as a hub, through
our diaspora populations or through
driving conflict which impacts on our
interests. However, none yet amount to
a major national security threat.

###### Planning assumptions about threat actors

**4.19** **Terrorism: the key planning**
assumptions are:

�� **international terrorism: assuming**
continued international pressure, the
Al Qa‘ida ‘core’ organisation may not
survive in its current form. The core
group will not be able to achieve its
strategic goal of establishing a
Caliphate, but it will still have the
capability to conduct significant terrorist
attacks. Al Qa‘ida affiliates will develop
more autonomy. Associated networks
and ‘self-starting’ groups will become
more prominent and develop significant
capabilities. They will continue to
gravitate towards fragile and failing
states, and to challenge them (notably
Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, and Somalia).
They will also have the capability to
conduct significant terrorist attacks,
including against western states.
A fragmentation of the core group of
Al Qa‘ida may cause a diversification of
the threat in the UK. ‘Self-starting’
organisations, old Al Qa‘ida affiliates
and other terrorist groups may all
become more important. Full planning
assumptions for international terrorism
are set out in the CONTEST strategy; and


�� **domestic terrorism: The principal**
threat remains from Irish related
terrorism, and in particular from
Dissident Republican groups. Frequent
attacks on the scale of Provisional Irish
Republican Army (PIRA) activity during
the ‘Troubles’ are highly unlikely, but the
risk of further attacks remains high.
Loyalist paramilitary groups remain
active, though the risk of them
mounting attacks will decrease if they
fully decommission weapons. The
planned devolution of policing and
justice may help to undermine Dissident
Republicans, though their activity will
remain unpredictable.

**4.20** **State threats: the key planning**
assumptions are:

�� we cannot rule out the re-emergence of
a major state-led threat but, in the
foreseeable future, there will remain no
state with the intent and capability to
threaten the independence, integrity
and self-government of the UK
mainland. State threats are more likely
to be manifested in less traditional,
non-military threat domains than
through military action;

�� however, some of our Overseas
Territories will continue to be subject to
territorial claims by other states, which
will seek to exert pressure on them
through some or all of diplomatic,
economic or military means;

�� some Allies of the UK, to which we
have an obligation under Article V of
the NATO Charter, could be threatened
from other states, through military or
other means; and

�� a number of states will continue to
pursue programmes to develop
offensive nuclear capabilities. Some
states may look to develop cyber attack
capabilities.


-----

**4.21** The other key planning assumptions
for threat actors are:

�� **Failing and fragile states: there will**
be continuing conflict, insurgency and
instability in failing or fragile states.
Some of these conflicts may have a
direct or indirect bearing on our
national security or that of our allies;

�� **Conflict: Violent conflict and serious**
instability between states will also
persist. Such conflicts may erupt quickly
and may engage states in which the UK
has a direct interest;

�� **Trans-national organised crime: the**
spread of globalisation and advances in
technology will continue to act as the
main facilitator of transnationally linked
serious organised crime- increasing the
pace of ‘old’ crimes such as drugs and
enabling ‘new’ crimes such as e-crime.
This will increase the ability of serious
organised criminals to operate from a
safe distance to minimise risk, enabling
criminals to locate in weak and/or
fragile states to evade detection; and

�� **Hazards: there is a likelihood of severe**
weather events and other hazards,
particularly widespread flooding,
sufficient to cause disruption in the UK.
The risk of pandemic influenza remains
high (as demonstrated by the current
outbreak).

###### Planning assumptions about actions in the domains of threat and the United Kingdom’s capabilities

**4.22** The National Security Strategy
recognises both how threats can arise and
the importance of maintaining, adapting
and, where necessary strengthening, the
capabilities of the UK to respond to them.


**4.23** The key planning assumptions for the
**domains of threat are:**

�� **Nuclear weapons and other**
**weapons of mass destruction: as well**
as some states seeking to acquire
nuclear capabilities, terrorists will
continue to seek access to chemical,
biological, radiological and nuclear
capabilities. There is an imperative to
secure fissile and other dangerous
material;

�� **Cyber space: this will become**
increasingly important as a national
security domain, as it continues to play
an ever greater role in almost all forms
of human activity; and

�� **Public opinion, culture, and**
**information: in turn, the**
connectedness across the globe
provided by cyber space means that the
domain of culture and public opinion
will be increasingly important.

**4.24** The UK has a range of capabilities,
spanning military and non-military
activities, underpinning our response to the
range of threats within the national
security strategy.

**4.25** The key planning assumptions are:

�� Operationally, activity in Afghanistan to
deny Al Qa’ida a haven and to increase
the stability of the nation of
Afghanistan is likely to dominate the
activities of UK Armed Forces;

�� Capacity-building will become an
increasingly important task for the UK’s
Armed Forces and will include tasks
such as security sector reform, training
of local security and military forces and
building local counter-insurgency skills.

�� The UK’s Armed Forces are likely to be
deployed to confront terrorists, manage
peacekeeping or assist with stabilisation
and development. In those cases, they


-----

are likely to be confronted by a mixture
of high-tech and low-tech military
capabilities; and the success of their
operations will depend less on
battlefield success and more on shaping
behaviours and gaining support for
political change;

�� Adversaries are unlikely to challenge the
UK (and its NATO allies) in traditional
military domains, given the Alliance’s
conventional superiority. However, there
are feasible scenarios which could draw
NATO allies into traditional military
conflict or which would have many of
the characteristics of traditional military
conflict; and

�� The range of potential threats which
require non-military capabilities will
continue to develop, as state and
non-state actors increasingly pose
threats in non-military domains.
Continued law enforcement, security
and intelligence work will be needed to
monitor the threat, to disrupt those
activities where necessary and to
prosecute through the criminal justice
system where possible;

�� To address the risk from terrorists,
hazards, and other threat actors, the
UK’s capabilities for responding to
non-military threats will continue to
need to become more integrated and
flexible, with a greater capability to
involve the citizen, local groups and the
private sector in maintaining and
enhancing the capabilities required; and

�� Over a 20 year horizon, significant
progress in modernising the
international rules based system is
essential if the global capability to tackle
increasingly global problems is to be
sufficiently robust in the long term. This
will require active diplomatic and other
effort from the UK.


**4.26** We do not include in this list any
overt planning assumptions about our
vulnerabilities, nor about gaps in our
capabilities, so as to avoid giving assistance
to actual or potential adversaries.

**4.27** We use this approach (principles,
strategic framework, interests, and
planning assumptions) to set priorities
across the whole of the national security
strategy, and within sub-strategies for
particular areas, to build up flexible
capabilities, and to use those capabilities.
The detailed priorities for particular areas
of action are set out in subsequent
chapters.

###### How Government is organised to protect national security

**4.28** The Government manages national
security issues, including all the issues
covered in this Strategy, through a crossGovernment approach involving many
departments and agencies, as well as
partners in civil society, other levels of
government, and international partners.
The integration of government action to
tackle national security is vital.

**4.29** Within Government, national security
matters are handled at strategic level by
the Cabinet committee for National
Security, International Relations and
Development (known as NSID), chaired by
the Prime Minister. There are also subcommittees of NSID, some chaired by the
Prime Minister and some by other senior
Ministers, which deal with particular
aspects of national security. These
committees are supported by the Cabinet
Secretariat, which works to ensure
coordination across Government of all
policy and action on national security
issues. Programme management of actions
set out in the National Security Strategy is
coordinated by the National Security
Secretariat in the Cabinet Office.


-----

###### The National Security Forum

The National Security Forum is a body of experts who provide independent advice to
the Government on matters relating to National Security. It was established in
interim form in March 2009, with members appointed by the Prime Minister. It is
chaired by Lord West of Spithead. The other members are: Professor Michael Clarke,
Professor Julia King, Sir David Manning, General Sir Rupert Smith, former Deputy
Assistant Commissioner Peter Clarke, Professor Amartya Sen, Professor Ziauddin
Sardar, Sir Ronnie Flanagan, Sir Michael Rake, Dame Juliet Wheldon and Sir David
Pepper. The Forum is tasked and directed through the Cabinet Committee on
National Security, International Relations and Development. It has met twice since its
establishment and its advice has contributed directly to the development of this
update to the National Security Strategy. The Forum’s work this year has also
included a consideration of the impact of the global economic and financial
downturn on national security, the implications for national security of competition
for energy and the Government’s draft Cyber Security Strategy.


**4.30** This work is supported by horizon
scanning on national security issues.
Horizon scanning is the systematic
examination of potential future threats and
opportunities, including those at the
margins of current and future thinking or
planning. In Security in an Interdependent
_World, we committed to strengthening our_
capacity for horizon scanning and, in July
2008, established a Strategic Horizons Unit
in the Cabinet Office. This Unit coordinates
horizon scanning on national security
issues across government to ensure that
the assessment of threat drivers, threat
actors, and domains of threat activity are
kept up to date, and looking to the future.
The Joint Intelligence Committee also
provides a strategic look at future trends.
This enables the national security strategy
process to anticipate and plan for some of
the problems of tomorrow.

**4.31** Parliamentary oversight of the
Strategy will be provided by a new Joint
Committee on the National Security
Strategy, comprising members of both
Houses of Parliament, and including the
chairs of some key House of Commons
select committees with an interest in
national security. The remit of this new
committee is to review the Strategy.


**4.32** Each component of the Strategy
requires cross-Government leadership and
coordination, as each requires more than
one department, and often many
departments, to work together to deliver
the actions needed for each component.

**4.33** Some aspects of national security
involve responsibilities and responses
which are devolved to the administrations
in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
For example, law enforcement and justice
are devolved in Scotland; and aspects of
resilience and the response to civil
emergencies are devolved in all three
countries. Responsibility for national
security as a whole is reserved to the UK
Government. The Government works
closely with the devolved administrations
to ensure that the aspects of national
security work falling to them contribute
effectively to the security of the whole of
the UK.

**4.34** Within central government, there are
lead Ministers and departments responsible
for each component as follows:

�� State-led threats to the UK – the Foreign
and Commonwealth Office.


-----

###### 2012 London Olympics

Providing security for the 2012 London Olympic and Paralympic Games is an
example of where activity across Government is integrated in support of a single
operational objective. The Games will be a celebration of sport and culture for
London and the UK. But the Games will pose security challenges, the starkest of
which is the threat of a terrorist attack on or associated with the Olympics. To
mitigate these risks, the Government has developed a comprehensive strategy with
the aim of delivering a safe and secure Games, in keeping with the Olympic culture
and spirit. Working with the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA), the London
Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG), the Police
and other key partners, the Government (through its Olympic Security and Safety
Programme) will:

�� protect Olympic venues, events and supporting transport infrastructure, and those
attending and using them;

�� prepare for events that may disrupt the safety and security of the Games and
ensure capabilities are in place to mitigate their impact;

�� identify and disrupt threats to the security of the Games;

�� command, control, plan and resource for the safety and security operation; and

�� engage with international and domestic partners and communities, to enhance
our security and ensure the success of our Strategy.

Olympic security measures will be integrated with, and draw on, resources allocated
under the United Kingdom’s Strategy for Countering International Terrorism
(CONTEST) and other pre-existing security regimes, such as those governing the
transport networks. Additionally, we aim to secure some legacy benefits from the
investment made in Olympic security which will support the security arrangements
for future sporting events, such as the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in 2014.


�� Global instability and conflict and failed
and fragile states – the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office.

�� Terrorism (with the exception of Irishrelated terrorism in Northern Ireland) –
the Home Office.

�� Irish-related terrorism in Northern
Ireland – the Northern Ireland Office.

�� Serious organised crime – the Home
Office (and within Northern Ireland, the
Northern Ireland Office).

�� Civil Emergencies – the Civil
Contingencies Secretariat in the Cabinet


Office, coordinating the work of lead
government departments for each type
of emergency (for example, the
Department of Health for human health
issues, and the Department of
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for
animal diseases).

**4.35** In addition, the lead responsibility for
coordinating action relevant for national
security on key threat drivers is as follows:

�� Global economic trends – Her Majesty’s
Treasury


-----

�� Climate change – Department of Energy
and Climate Change

�� Competition for energy – Department
of Energy and Climate Change

�� Poverty, inequality and poor governance
– Department for International
Development

�� Ideologies – work on the ideology
underpinning the main strand of
international terrorism is led by the
Office for Security and CounterTerrorism based in the Home Office

**4.36** The National Security Secretariat in
the Cabinet Office supports the Prime
Minister and NSID, and leads work to
address the interconnectedness of the
various threat drivers. This includes leading
a number of cross-cutting studies on key
areas of national security, and supporting
the work of the National Security Forum.


**4.37** Supporting these functions, there are
also lead responsibilities for coordinating
the development and application of our
national capabilities for acting in particular
domains:

�� military – Ministry of Defence

�� diplomatic – Foreign and
Commonwealth Office

�� intelligence – the Cabinet Office is
responsible for co-ordinating the Single
Intelligence Account and supports the
Prime Minister in overseeing the
intelligence community. The individual
heads of Agencies have responsibility in
statute for each Agency

�� cyber security – Office for Cyber Security
in the Cabinet Office

**4.38** It is important that the strands of
work on the various drivers, threat actors
and threat domains do not become
separate from each other, and create silos
of activity. It is the role of the Cabinet
Secretariat, supporting the National
Security, International Relations and
Development committee of the Cabinet,
to ensure that these strands of work are
considered strategically, balanced, and
prioritised to best effect in pursuit of our
overall national security objective.

#### Chapter 5

### UK National Security Framework – Tackling the drivers of insecurity


**5.1** Challenges to national security spring
from a variety of drivers and motivations.
This chapter looks at why there are
**challenges to the United Kingdom’s**
**interests and our way of life, and at**
**how we address them.**

**5.2** _Security in an Interdependent World_
identified some of the main drivers of
threats to national security. No such list of
drivers can be exhaustive or remain
constant over time. What matters is to
identify the most important drivers likely to
influence threat actors in ways which may
affect the UK, now and for the future. In
this Strategy we identify the following
priority drivers, which are most relevant for
the Government in tackling national
security challenges at source:

�� global economic trends and other global
trends, including demography and
migration;

�� climate change;

�� competition for energy;

�� poverty, inequality and poor
governance; and

�� ideologies.

###### Global trends – the world economy, technology, and demography

**5.3** Understanding and responding to
fast-changing global trends is at the heart
of our strategic approach to national
security. As this strategy explains,
globalisation has created both
opportunities and challenges. Alongside


a robust rules based system, the continued
development of globalisation and the more
equal distribution of benefits remains the
best way to achieve future security and
stability.

###### The United Kingdom as a globalised nation

**5.4** The UK is a highly ‘globalised’ nation.
This reflects our long history as an open,
outward facing, trading nation and a hub
of global activity. As Chapter 3 explained,
the distinctive characteristics of the UK as a
nation mean that it is impossible, when
thinking about our own national security
interests, to separate the ‘domestic’ and
the ‘international’.

**5.5** The UK has and will continue to
benefit from globalisation. We have a
strong interest in monitoring and
managing its development and in
maximising the opportunities and
addressing the challenges that it creates. In
_Security in an Interdependent World, we_
identified three sets of challenges which
continue to be important: the increasing
interconnectedness of and
interdependence within the global
economy; the impact of technology in
reducing barriers between international
activity; and the growth and mobility of
the global population.

###### A more global economy

**5.6** The pace of global integration has
increased profoundly over the twenty years
since the Cold War ended. A range of
factors have driven this. Within the world
economy, the collapse of communism
opened up previously closed markets to


-----

global trade, and the emergence of high
growth regions, particularly though not
exclusively in Asia, has greatly increased
the capacity of world output. The
accompanying leap in productivity, as well
as lower transport costs, has had a
significant impact. In the current recession,
global trade flows have fallen, but in the
last two decades, the trend has been
towards cheaper goods and high levels of
global trade.

**5.7** As the past year has demonstrated,
economic shocks can be quickly
transmitted across national borders. There
is, therefore, a compelling need for
concerted global responses to global
problems to aid economic recovery,
including the promotion of trade.

###### Technology

**5.8** Economies and societies around the
world are increasingly dependent on
electronic information and communication
systems which remain vulnerable to
terrorist, criminal or state-led cyber attack.
The fast changing nature of
communications requires active and
concerted international action to ensure
that communications assets are secure.

**5.9** In a globalised world, scientific
research is increasingly undertaken by
globally dispersed teams. Developments
spread widely and quickly, and information
and capability lies with small groups and
individuals. Further, the continued
proliferation of new technologies and the
rapid pace of change can be exploited for
illicit as well as legitimate means. Virtual
actors can operate in cyber space, across
boundaries and beyond the control of state
hosts. They are able to join together and
dissolve both at will and at speed, and
almost instantaneously reach larger


audiences than ever before. This means
their impact may far exceed any required
effort or outlay.

**5.10** As well as computer technology,
developments in fields such as
bioengineering, nanotechnology, medicine
and the exploitation of space are
transforming the way we live. The
acceleration of technical evolution is one
of the major opportunities, but also one of
the challenges for national security into the
future as criminals and terrorist groups
change their tactics to exploit the new
technology. The government is committed
to regular horizon scanning for
technological and scientific developments,
in order to maximise benefits and minimise
the risks to our national security.

###### Demography

**5.11** The world’s population is growing
and is expected to exceed 9.1 billion by
2050[19]. The global population is also
ageing, especially in developed countries,
where the size of the elderly population is
already greater than the number of
children[20]. However, in many of the world’s
poorest and most fragile regions, there is a
demographic ‘youth bulge’, where as
much as two thirds of the population is
under 25. Finally, there continues to be a
trend towards urbanisation and the world’s
urban population is expected to grow year
on year, reaching a total of 6.4 billion in
2050[21]. These combined trends will impact
on many of the drivers of insecurity.

**5.12** There will be increased pressure on
resources. The Government’s Chief
Scientific Advisor estimates that, by 2030,
the demand for food will rise by 50 per
cent, water by 30 per cent, and energy by
close to 50 per cent. As the population
suffering from a shortage of supplies

increases, so does the possibility of
disputes. Urbanisation, when coupled with
problems such as poor infrastructure and
political exclusion, present increased risk of
social and political instability, conflict and
disorder. In poorer countries, with large
working-age and youthful populations,
unemployment will have been exacerbated
by the economic slowdown. This could
have a destabilising effect and increase the
risk of social unrest, criminal activity and
disorder.

**5.13** Trends such as population growth,
urbanisation and climate change not only
present security challenges but also tend to
increase migration in the longer term.
There are over 190 million international
migrants around the world. This number is
expected to increase to 230 million by
2050.[22] Immigrants form an increasingly
large part of the workforce in many
industrialised economies, and are especially
important for countries with ageing
populations. Human mobility makes
economies more dynamic and more
efficient. Remittances from migrant
workers far exceed international aid as a
source of income to the developing world.

**5.14** The economic slowdown is likely to
have some impact on global migration,
though the effects will be complex and
hard to predict. Global levels of migration
from less developed to more developed
countries are likely to slow temporarily and
some migrant workers may return to their
country of origin.

Despite these immediate effects, in the
longer term, migration will continue to be
an important trend. Increased pressure on
water and food supplies, severe weather
events and continued global economic
inequality are all likely to stimulate global
migration on a large scale in future.


**5.15** In Chapter 2, we explained that the
continued openness of global economies
was the best route to long-term stability
and security. So too is the openness of
societies an important factor in achieving a
secure, prosperous world. Moves towards
closed societies, or economies, would
decrease overall stability and increase risk.
However, the global movement of people
must be properly managed so that its
effects do not create or compound security
challenges.

###### The longer term response

**5.16** Our response will be the same as that
outlined throughout this strategy: a
commitment to acting early, assessing
future risks, and working in partnership in
support of a progressive, multilateral and
rules based approach.

**5.17** We will drive forward the programme
collectively agreed at the London Summit.
We are also committed to pushing for a
resumption and successful completion of
world trade negotiations, as well as the
liberalisation of agricultural trade and
better measures to manage water demand
and promote efficiency.

**5.18** We are working actively with
partners internationally to monitor and
protect the safety and security of new
technology. We continue to support
international efforts to manage global
migration patterns and will continue to
manage migration in a way that is fair and
in the interests of our economy.

###### Climate change

**5.19** There are two interrelated ways in
which climate change acts as a driver of
insecurity, both internationally and
domestically.


22 UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (2002) Population Division: International Migration Report 2002.


-----

###### International risk multiplier
�� Globally, climate change will increasingly
be a wide-ranging driver of insecurity
because it acts as a ‘threat multiplier’,
exacerbating existing weakness and
tensions around the world. It presents a
challenge that goes far beyond direct
physical disruption to the environment.
Climate change could lead to a widerange of social, economic and political
problems such as large-scale migration,
water stress, crop failure and food
shortages, faster and wider spread of
diseases, increased scarcity of resources,
economic instability and the possibility
of new geopolitical disputes.

�� Everyone is affected by climate change,
but the most vulnerable will be those
least able to cope, especially developing
countries and states with weak
governance. Climate changes will
increase poverty in the developing world
and, though the links are complex,
could tip fragile states into instability,
conflict and state failure. Climate
change might also lead to social unrest
and power vacuums, making it easier
for extremists and organised criminals to
move in. Climate change therefore has
the potential to impact on many of the
UK’s current and future security
concerns. This emphasises the need for
an ambitious global deal in Copenhagen
later this year. Progress by the UN
Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) to reach a global
agreement on emissions reduction, to
help limit temperature increases, will be
essential.

###### Direct impacts within the UK
�� Domestically, we are already seeing the
environmental impacts of climate
change in the more frequent extreme
weather events of recent years. These


are likely to increase in frequency and
severity in the future. In the coming
years, national security impacts will
mainly be linked to an increase in
weather driven civil emergencies. But in
the long term, climate change impacts
are likely to increase our vulnerability
more widely: affecting our transport,
energy and water infrastructure, public
and private property, citizen health and
agriculture and food production. This is
underlined by the new UK Climate
Projections 2009[24] which illustrate that
climate change presents a long-term
security challenge to the UK without
effective mitigation and adaptation
action.

**5.20** While the most serious impacts of
climate change domestically and globally
may not be seen for many years, we need
to act now to address the security
implications. The UK is at the forefront of
tackling climate change, both domestically
and internationally, in order to mitigate the
impacts of climate change that are
projected to affect our national security
and adapt to the climate change which is
already unavoidable.

###### Climate Change – the past year

**5.21** Events during the past year have
further strengthened the Government’s
resolve to tackle the risk of dangerous
climate change. The latest research,
presented at the Climate Change Congress
in Copenhagen in March 2009, suggests
that human-induced climate change is
more severe and happening at a faster rate
than previously thought. The economic
downturn poses new challenges, including
risks to global investment in low carbon
technologies and mitigation measures. But
it also presents opportunities. By moving to
a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy,
the UK can secure economic recovery and

###### Climate Change: Government progress on commitments in the past year

In the past year, the Government has led multilateral efforts to tackle climate change
through a reduction in carbon emissions and work to ensure that systems are in place
domestically and internationally to deliver mitigation and adaptation policies. This includes:

**Progress towards Copenhagen**
�� The European Union (EU) has achieved agreement on a 20 per cent reduction in
green house gas emissions by 2020 (or 30 per cent in the event of a global deal),
a 20 per cent renewable energy target by 2020 and a 20 per cent reduction in EU
energy consumption by 2020. This represents a significant step towards a global
agreement on climate change commitments after 2012.

**Making the transition to a low-carbon economy**
�� The UK Climate Change Act 2008 set a legally binding target to reduce the UK’s
greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80 per cent by 2050, and introduced the
world’s first legally binding carbon budgets, alongside a statutory framework to
adapt to climate change.

**Increased funding on climate change research**
�� The Government has provided £10.4 billion funding for low carbon and energy
investment over the next three years.
�� A new funding mechanism for coal carbon capture and storage has been
established to support up to four demonstration projects and a proposal to step
up efforts to develop the Center for Climate Strategies.

**Developing a global carbon market**
�� With EU Emissions Trading Scheme partners, and through other multilateral
groups, UK effort contributed to a doubling from 2007 to 2008 in the value of
the global market and an increase of 61 per cent in the volume of allowances.

**Building capacity in developing countries**
�� The UK has helped to deliver progress towards international adaptation to help
developing countries build their resilience to climate change, including the Pilot
Programme for Climate Resilience under the Climate Investment Funds (the UK
has pledged £800 million to these Funds).

**Building capacity at home**
�� We have also achieved progress on domestic adaptation including a crossgovernment Adapting to Climate Change Programme.


growth at home and also provide the
necessary international leadership for
action.

###### Future Challenges and the Longer Term Response

**5.22** This year is a critical window of
opportunity. The increased emphasis on
climate change by the US administration is


very welcome and the G20 took an
important step forward when it reaffirmed
at the London Summit its commitment to
‘address the threat of irreversible climate
change’.

**5.23** We have the opportunity, through an
ambitious global agreement, to prevent
dangerous climate change. Global
emissions will need to peak and start a


-----

significant decline within the next ten years
if we are to prevent temperature rises of
over two degrees Celsius. However, some
impacts are already inevitable, both in the
UK and globally. Our work to mitigate the
impact of climate change, and to adapt to
what is already unavoidable, will include:

�� The UK will play a full part in
preparations for UN negotiations on a
**new international climate change**
**agreement in Copenhagen in**
December 2009. The Department of
Energy and Climate Change (DECC) will
shortly publish our key priorities for the
negotiations including for emissions
reductions, financing and technology
development and international
adaptation.

�� The Government will shortly publish its
**Strategy for Climate and Energy,**
setting out policies to deliver our first
three carbon budgets (to 2022) and
continue progress towards our 2050
emission targets as required by the
Climate Change Act. The Strategy will
set out measures to cut UK emissions by
34 per cent by 2020 and 80 per cent by
2050 through investment in energy
efficiency and clean energy technologies
such as renewables, nuclear and carbon
capture and storage.

�� The Government will shortly publish its
fourth paper on International
Development: Building our Common
_Future_ which will include plans to
strengthen support for developing
countries by building their resilience and
adaptive capacities.

�� We will continue preparation for the
long-term domestic impacts of climate
change through our cross**Government Adapting to Climate**
**Change Programme. The new UK**
Climate Projections, together with the
actions set out in the summary


document published alongside, are an
important part of this. The first UK
**Climate Change Risk Assessment**
process will start in the autumn and will
build on the Projections and further
develop our approach to domestic
adaptation. Potential national security
risks will be considered as an integral
part of this work and will feed into the
established medium term risk
assessment process which underpins the
National Risk Register.

�� Through our leading role in climate
**research, both domestically and**
internationally, we will continue to
improve our understanding of climate
change and the actions we need to take
to address it.

###### Competition for energy

**5.24** Energy is a fundamental building
block of the global economy. Secure supply
is crucial to ensuring stability and growth.
Energy presents security challenges in a
number of ways. Most obviously, as
demand increases across the globe,
supplies may not be able to keep up,
intensifying competition for energy and
leading to instability and conflict. Increased
competition may drive prices higher,
positively impacting on the economic
power of producer states. However, higher
prices should also incentivise investment in
energy production and help to drive energy
efficiency.

**5.25** There are other potential risks. The
stability and security of our domestic
energy supply is fundamental to our
day-to-day lives and this supply is
increasingly coming from energy imports.
This can make us vulnerable to a number
of disruptive challenges. For example,
energy could be used as a geopolitical lever
by a state threatening to restrict the energy
supplies of the UK or our allies. The
motivation of the state might not itself be


-----

-----

linked to energy, but rather reflect wider
political considerations. We also know that
some terrorists aspire to attack critical
national energy infrastructure. Other
scenarios need not involve malicious intent.
We have already seen that extreme
weather events, such as the 2007 summer
floods, can threaten our energy
infrastructure. Accidents, such as the
Buncefield Oil Depot explosions and fire of
December 2005, remain a risk too.

###### Competition for energy as a driver of insecurity

**5.26** Global energy demand, on the basis
of governments’ existing policies, is
forecast to continue to increase by around
45 per cent between 2006 and 2030.[25]
Although the world is far from running out
of oil and gas, output from mature oil
fields is currently in decline. Remaining
resources are harder to find, reach or
access and are concentrated in areas of
environmental sensitivity and/or potential
political instability.

**5.27** The scope for disputes and conflict
within, and between, states could increase
as a wider range of actors, with increased
projected demands for energy, compete for
limited resources. There have been recent
examples of civil wars where energy has
been used as a lever. Additionally, a state
that has concerns about its access to energy
resources could be motivated to threaten
the UK or our allies. The impact of climate
change increases potential security threats
as states compete for access to energy and
other resources in previously ungoverned
spaces such as the Arctic. In a more
competitive energy environment, price
security will also be more difficult to
achieve.


###### Wider competition for resources

**5.28** Competition for other natural
resources such as food, water and minerals
may be a significant driver of conflict,
especially in countries with
poor governance. In Africa, some of the
most enduring conflicts have taken place
in countries with significant natural
resources, such as Angola. Competition for
water resources can be particularly
destabilising and is set to increase in the
future as the climate warms. For example,
by 2035 the melting of Himalayan glaciers
could affect the water supplies of three
quarters of a billion people in Asia. In
addition, natural resources that can be
easily smuggled out of a country
(diamonds most obviously) have the
potential to act as both a cause and a
means of financing violent conflict.

###### Competition for energy – the past year

**5.29** Developments over the past year have
reinforced the need to understand and
address competition for energy as a driver
of insecurity. The economic downturn has
led to a contraction of energy demand.
Lower oil and gas prices, coupled with
higher spare capacity levels, has increased
our security of supply in the short term.
However, the fall in commodity prices has
meant reduced or delayed investment in
global energy infrastructure, particularly in
oil and gas. This could have security
implications for the UK in the longer term,
particularly when demand rises as the
global economy recovers. An energy supply
crunch would cause significant price-rise
risks and could exacerbate the potential for
global instability and conflict.

**5.30** The cut off in supply of Russian gas
through the Ukraine to Europe in January
2009 demonstrated the potential for
energy to be used as a political lever. It also

###### Energy: Government progress on commitments in the past year

**To mitigate competition for energy as a driver of instability and conflict,**
**we have:**
�� Continual bilateral co-operation with producer countries, such as Nigeria,
to help tackle the role energy competition plays in instability and conflict.

**To address energy competition challenges and threats, we have:**
�� Worked internationally and within the EU to develop competitive oil and gas
**markets, increase physical security of supply and reduce price volatility. This**
includes:
– measures agreed at the London Energy Meeting to enhance oil market
transparency and reduce price volatility;
– the European Commission’s second Strategic Energy Review; and
– agreement of the Third Market Liberalisation Package to improve the
functioning of the EU’s gas and electricity markets.

�� Focussed on energy diversification. This includes:
– working bilaterally with a range of countries, and through multi-lateral
organisations, to increase sources and routes of supply and to facilitate
investment in gas supply infrastructure to manage new imports;
– championing new routes of supply in the UK and Europe; and
– diversifying use of different energy types including facilitating new build
nuclear power stations, improving take-up of renewables to meet the new
EU 2020 renewable energy target of 20% and world leading action on coal
carbon capture and storage.

**To tackle other energy security related challenges, we have:**
�� Pursued bilateral and multilateral dialogue on a range of energy security
issues, including work to strengthen EU-Russia dialogue.

�� Undertaken an extensive programme of security enhancements at critical
**energy sites as part of our wider work to counter the threat of terrorism.**

�� Worked to reduce the vulnerability of our energy infrastructure to natural
hazards, as well as to disruption by terrorist acts, following on from Sir Michael
Pitt’s Review of the flooding emergency that took place in June and July 2007.


demonstrated the importance of EU energy
security for our domestic energy security.
Due to the diversity of our gas supplies,
the significant increase in our import
infrastructure in recent years and our
limited reliance on Russian gas, the UK
experienced little direct effect. However, in
certain circumstances, a longer cut off
could have led to the UK balance of supply
and demand becoming tight, highlighting
the need to monitor and review the
mechanisms for ensuring continued supply.


###### Future Challenges and the Longer Term Response

**5.31** It is clear that the current reduction
in global energy demand is a temporary
departure from the long-term trend of
increased consumption. UK import reliance
is expected to continue to increase. By
2020 we expect to import a much greater
proportion of the oil and gas we use:
DECC projections suggest more than 50
per cent compared to less than 20 per cent
in 2008. We will therefore become more


-----

like other major consuming countries in
facing increasing competition for supplies,
exposure to developments in the global
energy markets and the associated
geopolitical risks.

**5.32** The Government is adopting energy
efficiency measures to reduce the energy
intensity of our economy and moving to
more diverse sources of low-carbon energy.
In the long term, this will reduce our
dependence on fossil fuels. Nevertheless,
the UK will be reliant on imported fossil
fuels for the foreseeable future. We will
therefore need to continue to ensure
secure and reliable supplies of oil and gas
in order to maintain the stability required
to enable the UK to make the transition to
a low carbon economy. We will also need
to address new security challenges linked
to this transition, most obviously the risk of
proliferation due to an increase in the use
of civil nuclear power.

**5.33** Decisions we make in relation to
energy will also have far-reaching
implications for other drivers of insecurity,
most obviously climate change. The
Government will therefore continue to
work internationally, within the EU and
domestically to mitigate the energy risks
identified, while undertaking an urgent
transition to a low-carbon economy. This
will build on the work taken forward in the
past year and includes:

�� The UK Government’s forthcoming
**National Strategy for** **Climate and**
**Energy setting out the Government’s**
strategic role within a dynamic market.

�� We will set out a Renewable Energy
**Strategy, detailing the Government’s**
action plan for ensuring that 15 per cent
(our share of the overall EU target of 20
per cent) of our energy consumption
comes from renewable sources by 2020.
Work to decarbonise the economy will
bring security benefits by reducing our


reliance on foreign supplies of gas and
oil.

�� The Government’s forthcoming ‘Road
**to 2010’ document, which will set out**
our approach to the proliferation
challenges linked to increased use of
civil nuclear power.

###### Within the EU
�� The Government will work to support
and drive further action at an EU
**level.** This must aim to strengthen UK
energy security, while increasing EU
energy security as a whole. We will
continue to press for the opening up of
EU energy markets, in particular
through the implementation of the
Third Market Liberalisation Package.
We will also work to improve Europe’s
ability to respond to potential future
supply disruption, including through
revisions to the Gas Security of Supply
Directive. Finally, we will continue to
encourage the EU to increase the
diversity of the sources of its energy
supply, in particular through the
development of a ‘Southern Corridor’
bringing Caspian Sea gas to the EU via
Turkey. These measures will complement
action to move Europe towards a
low-carbon economy, which will also
have long-term energy security benefits.

###### Internationally
�� The Malcolm Wicks Review is an
independent review of international
energy security issues, commissioned by
the Government in 2008. The report,
due to be published in July will contain
recommendations on what further
measures the UK might take,
domestically and internationally, to
reduce and address the risks posed by
our increasing dependence on imported
oil and gas. We will also consider
whether the Review identifies wider
national security implications.


-----

**5.34** The Government will press for
improvements in international energy
**governance through a process involving**
the International Energy Forum, the
International Energy Agency (IEA), the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) and others. We have
been at the forefront of the IEA’s work to
reach out to key energy states like India,
China and Russia, but will push for further
progress in the coming period. We also
work bilaterally with a range of countries
to build strategic energy partnerships that
will enhance our security of oil and gas
supply over the longer term.

**5.35** The Government’s effort to tackle the
many and disparate issues arising from
both climate change and energy supply are
now led by a single department, the
Department of Energy and Climate
Change. This is one of the most significant
changes in the machinery of Government
in recent years and emphasises the
Government’s determination to tackle long
term and interrelated challenges.

###### Poverty, inequality and poor governance

**5.36** Poverty can be a driver of insecurity
through its contribution to conflict and
fragility in developing countries. Such
instability can have implications for the
United Kingdom, for example by driving
migration patterns which can spread
threats such as people trafficking closer to
home. Recognising this, Security in an
_Interdependent World reiterated the_
Government’s commitment to meeting the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),[25]
with a particular focus on fragile states.


**5.37** Over one billion people live on less
than $1.25 a day. Poverty, inequality and
poor governance can both drive and
worsen the impact of violent conflict,
terrorism, organised crime, climate change
and health pandemics, as well as make it
more difficult to mount an effective
operational response.

**5.38** The vulnerability of developing
countries has implications for global
security and the UK, whether manifested
through flows of illegal drugs and firearms
into our cities, or the current terrorist
threat. It is in our shared interests to
support the efforts of all developing
countries to increase their resilience by
addressing poverty and inequality. The UK’s
commitment to poverty reduction and
achievement of the MDGs is not only
morally right in itself; it can also contribute
to our shared interests, and to our own
security. More effective and accountable
states in poor countries will be better able
to meet the aspirations of their citizens and
deliver basic state functions, as well as
making it more difficult for terrorist
organisations to recruit and operate in
these areas. The UK is committed not only
to ensuring that our own development
assistance is used effectively to reduce
poverty but also that the international
system provides the right support for
developing countries. The UK has a
particular interest in contributing to shared
responses to shared problems because our
way of life is dependent, to a greater
extent than in many other countries, on
the free movement of goods, money,
people and ideas.


25 The MDGs are eight specific goals to be met by 2015 that aim to combat extreme poverty across the world.
These goals were created at the UN Millennium Summit in New York in 2000.


-----

###### Tackling poverty: Government progress on commitments in the past year

**Continued action towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs):**

�� During 2008, the Government, alongside the UN, continued to drive forward the
MDG Call to Action campaign, galvanising international support for efforts to
accelerate progress on the MDGs.

**An increased development budget**

�� We are on track to achieve the UN target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income
(GNI) by 2013, as reflected by the year on year increase in the UK’s Overseas
Development Aid expenditure from 0.36 per cent of GNI in 2007 to 0.43 per cent
in 2008 and the budgeted spend of £7.5 billion, estimated as approximately 0.50
per cent of GNI for 2009.

�� Within this, Department for International Development is also currently
committed to ensure spending on education in developing countries is increased
to £1 billion by 2010/11 and to spend £8.5 billion on education by 2015/16. In
June 2008, the government announced a commitment to spend £6 billion on
health systems and services over 7 years to 2015, and is also committed to
providing £1 billion to the Global Health Fund.

**More assistance to fragile states and regions where links between insecurity,**
**poverty and conflict strongest**

�� DFID has significantly increased development assistance to fragile states over
recent years. In the five years to March 2009 the UK has doubled its aid to
conflict-affected and fragile countries to £1.2 billion per year, and is now the third
largest bilateral donor.

**Working to ensure that mineral revenues contribute to economic**
**development, political stability and security**

�� The Government strongly supported the launch in 2002 of the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). We continue to support the EITI in its aim
to increase the transparency of revenues paid by extractives companies to host
governments.


###### Poverty – the past year

**5.39** The impact of the economic
downturn on developing countries is
serious. Growth for emerging and
developing countries is expected to grow


at 1.6 per cent in 2009 and 4 per cent in
2010[26] compared to growth rates of 8.3
per cent and 6.1 per cent in 2007 and
2008 respectively. The World Bank expects
remittances to fall significantly during
2009, by up to 8 per cent.[27]


26 IMF’s World Economic Outlook (April 2009).
27 World Bank Migration and Development Brief: March 23 2009.


-----

**5.40** The lack of social insurance systems
across the developing world will force
many poor and vulnerable households to
sell their few remaining assets, often small
amounts of livestock or land. This might
mean that they may not be able to take
advantage of the recovery when it arrives
and will remain in poverty.

**5.41** Prior to the economic crisis,
developing countries were already
contending with a massive increase in food
commodity prices. While international food
prices have come down significantly over
the past year, food insecurity in developing
countries continues to rise in the face of
the global economic crisis, causing
increased hunger and poverty.

**5.42** These developments, combined with
population growth, suggest the impact on
poverty will be significant. DFID has
estimated that 90 million more people will
be in poverty (living on less than $1.25 per
day) after 2010 than had been previously
anticipated. In these circumstances, the risk
of conflict is heightened.

###### Future Challenges and the Longer Term Response

**5.43** Investment by the UK development
programme to achieve the MDGs and
improve governance reduces the risks of
instability and conflict by helping
developing countries to address many of its
underlying causes. However, the current
economic context requires additional
support for developing countries, ensuring
that we are using development assistance
for the right things and in the right way to
maximise our impact on poverty reduction.

**5.44** During the economic downturn, we
will work to protect the poorest by
increasing support for social protection. The
UK is working with the World Bank to
design and finance a Rapid Social Response
Fund to channel funds quickly to countrylevel social protection systems, where people


have been badly affected by the crisis. This
will help reduce the impact of the downturn
on individuals but also reduce the risk of
social unrest. We will also give new priority
to ensuring the poorest countries build back
resilient and sustained economic growth.

**5.45** DFID is also exploring new
approaches in fragile and conflict-affected
countries, focused on peace-building and
state-building. This includes doing more to
provide justice, security and economic
opportunities for the poor and new, joint
Government strategies in fragile countries.

**5.46** The economic downturn is already
impacting on international aid
commitments and progress against the
MDGs more broadly. The UK has reiterated
its development commitments, including
increasing aid to achieve the UN’s 0.7 per
cent target and encourages others to do
the same. At the London Summit, world
leaders reaffirmed their commitments to
development, including the provision of
aid. Continued action is needed to ensure
the downturn does not irrevocably damage
the development prospects of the poorest.

###### Ideologies and beliefs

**5.47** Previous sections discussed various
objective or external drivers which can
motivate threats. But threats can also be
motivated by human and social concerns.
A particularly important category of threat
driver in the last century has been ideology.

**5.48** Ideologies comprise a broad grouping
of many types of belief. For a variety of
reasons – political, economic, historical,
ethnic or religious – different groups of
individuals, some organised in states, and
some non-states, have propagated
ideologies which can be hostile to the UK
and its people, and or to our allies and
partners. In the twentieth century, the UK
and its allies faced existential challenges
from the ideologies of Nazism and world
communism.


-----

**5.49** We do not currently face such a
severe challenge from any ideology. Nor
do we form part of a culture or civilisation
that is threatened by other discrete cultures
or civilisations. But ideologies can still be
motivating forces for threats which are
real, even if on a smaller scale than those
of the last century.

**5.50** The current threat from international
terrorism is driven by a violent extremist
ideology associated with Al Qa’ida. This
ideology regards most governments in
Muslim countries to be ‘un-Islamic’ or
apostate; claims that these governments
are sustained by western states who are
engaged in an attack on Islam; and
considers violent action to be a religious
duty. So in responding to the threat of
international terrorism, we have to
consider how to address this ideology, just
as we addressed the ideological appeal of
world communism, in the UK and
overseas, during the Cold War. The
Government’s action against this ideology
is described further in Chapter 6, which
outlines our counter-terrorism strategy.

**5.51** We assess that apart from this
example, at present, there is no other
competing world ideology of sufficient
force to drive national security threats to
the UK or its people. However, regionally
based ideologies – particularly forms of
nationalism, religious sectarianism, or
separatism – can still affect the UK. Given
our role as a hub for international activity,
and for the movement and settlement of
peoples from many countries, regional
conflicts driven by ideology can potentially
reach into the UK. Examples include
disputes in Sri Lanka, in Kashmir and in the
Caucasus. To date, the impact of these
regional ideologies has not been enough
to constitute a driver of threat in the UK.
But we must continue to monitor the
impact of such disputes, and to scan the
horizon for other disputes which could in
time – like the early precursors of Al Qa’ida


in the 1990s – ultimately turn into a threat
to us.

**5.52** Ideologies can be, and often are,
pursued by legitimate and peaceful means.
The peaceful political pursuit of beliefs
amounting to an ideology is not an issue
for national security. Indeed, the pursuit of
a belief in freedom can be a positive force
for good, as in Central and Eastern Europe
in the 1980s and 1990s.

**5.53** It is not always easy to determine
whether the actions of states to expand
their influence and advance their interests
are explicitly ideological; or whether they
arise from other reasons, such as fear of
other states, or differences in perception
about the actions or aims of other states,
or from rivalries between states.
Throughout history, there have been
examples of states seeking to expand their
power and influence at the expense of
other states, not necessarily for identifiable
ideological reasons.

**5.54** But whether actions are driven
ideologically or not, there are always
driving beliefs which are important. This
premise has three important consequences:

�� First, that in order to address any
resulting threat, we have to tackle the
underlying beliefs: either by tackling the
ideology, if there is one; or by working
to change the beliefs of the state
concerned which are motivating its
hostile actions. This is a classic role for
diplomacy;

�� Secondly, that it may also require
appealing directly to the people of the
state concerned, to try and build a
shared set of beliefs which will reduce
the tendency to hostility. This requires
action in the domain of public opinion;

�� Thirdly, such rivalries can be made less
potentially harmful if they are
constrained within multilateral systems


-----

of rules, at the global level through the
United Nations, though international
law, through security and defence
alliances such as NATO, and through
regional organisations, particularly in
Europe through the European Union.
A rules-based international system is
vital to help turn any rivalry into
peaceful competition and in turn into
constructive cooperation. This is another
compelling argument for strong
multilateral governance.

#### Chapter 6

### UK National Security Framework – Addressing the Threat Actors


**6.1** The Government has developed a
comprehensive view of potential national
security threats. It includes all those threats
which could cause a major disruptive
challenge to our country, and which could
prevent UK citizens from going about their
daily business and maintaining their way of
life.

**6.2** In analysing national security threats,
the Government analyses the source of the
threats systematically. Threats may come
from:

�� intentional, hostile human action,

�� from unintentional human action,
i.e. from accidents;

�� or from the effect of natural
phenomena, i.e. from hazards

**6.3** The bulk of national security threats of
course relate to intentional, hostile human
action. These ‘threat actors’ include:

�� state actors –

– established, capable states (state-led
threats); and

– failing and fragile states, and groups
or individuals operating within
conflicts in or between such states

�� non-state actors –

– terrorists, insurgents and other
non-state actors motivated by
ideology

– transnational organised criminals –
people motivated by pecuniary rather
than ideological motives.


**6.4** Taken together, this provides a
comprehensive view of threat actors (those
who may pose a threat), including state
and non-state actors, and accidents and
natural hazards. The National Security
Framework is accordingly structured to
reflect these five categories of threat, the
four listed above, and civil emergencies.

###### State-led threats to the UK

**6.5** _Security in an Interdependent World_
recognised that the bi-polar world of The
Cold War has been replaced by a more
complex set of relationships. The global
balance of power has changed, and is still
changing. Whilst we no longer face a
major state-led existential threat to our
national security, the threats we do face
come from a wider and less predictable
range of sources. The nature of threats is
also diversifying.

**6.6** Instead of taking offensive military
action there is a realistic possibility, within
the 20 year horizon, that a state may seek
to threaten the stability or freedom of
action of the UK, its overseas territories or
its allies through non-military means by, for
example: disrupting or denying access to
critical services such as energy supply;
exerting malign influence on citizens or the
Government; causing sudden malicious
damage to economic infrastructure, or
sponsoring terrorist activities against the
UK or its interests. To achieve these effects,
a state may chose to employ a number of
different levers such as cyber attack or
espionage (both human and technical), or
bring to bear significant economic or trade
pressure.


-----

###### State-led threats: Government progress on commitments in the last year

Much of the Government’s responses to current and future state-led threats are not
made public for essential national security reasons. Therefore, it is not possible to
include them all in a public document. However, since March 2008:

�� The Government has strengthened further the full range of both its military and
intelligence capabilities, as described earlier in Chapter 3.

�� Through the establishment of the new Strategic Horizons Unit in the Cabinet
Office, we have enhanced our ability to scan the horizon for future threats,
including those that are state-led, and plan accordingly.

�� In order to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities which might be exploited by
hostile foreign states, the Government continues to invest in collaborative
working with critical national infrastructure providers and to provide advice on
physical, electronic and personnel security. This effort is led by the Centre for the
Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) and CESG, the UK’s National Technical
Authority for Information Assurance. Up to date advice is also available for
individuals, academic and research institutes and businesses to mitigate the risks
presented by hostile foreign states.

�� Finally, the Cabinet Office has led a programme of work over the past year to
develop the UK’s first Cyber Security Strategy which addresses the full range of
threats, including those from hostile states. This is explained in full in Chapter 7.


###### Future challenges

 Military threats
**6.7** We continue to assess that for the
foreseeable future it is unlikely that any
state or alliance will have both the intent
and capability to threaten the
independence, integrity and selfgovernment of the UK militarily. However,
history has shown that it can be
notoriously difficult to predict the
circumstances and character of future
conflict, and it is not possible to rule out
the re-emergence of a major state-led
threat to the UK over the longer term. We
will need, therefore, to continue to review
the nature of military state-led threats,
including in relation to our Overseas
Territories, some of which remain subject
to territorial claims by other states. It is also
possible that allies of the UK, to which we
have an obligation under Article V of the


NATO Charter, could be threatened by
other states, through military or other
means. Finally, certain states’ intention to
acquire nuclear weapons, and the
proliferation of ballistic missile technology
and other systems, could transform
regional security dynamics and generate
conflicts which, either directly or indirectly,
could pose a considerable threat to UK
interests.

###### Non-military threats
**6.8** As highlighted in Security in an
_Interdependent World, the UK already_
faces a sophisticated and pervasive threat
from hostile foreign intelligence activity,
much of which is conducted in the cyber
domain. There is no reason to expect this
to diminish in the short or medium term.
The techniques used by some state actors
also have the potential to go beyond
traditional intelligence gathering and may


-----

also be used for spreading disinformation
or attempting to disrupt critical services.

**6.9** As Chapter 5 noted, the potential for
one state to use its control over resources
to apply political pressure on another was
highlighted earlier this year. The gas
dispute that led to a disruption of Russian
gas flowing through the Ukraine resulted
in widespread gas supply shortages in the
EU. Although not an imminent concern for
the UK, we need to recognise the role that
access to critical resources, such as energy
supply, may play in defining the global
security landscape in the future. We must
work to ensure that we have in place
adequate protection and mitigation
measures. Given the interconnectedness of
global financial markets, we also need to
be alive to the possibility that hostile states
may turn to economic or trade levers more
widely to exert malign pressure on the UK.

**6.10** The UK continues to benefit from
significant inward foreign investment,
including in elements of its critical national
infrastructure (CNI) and we are reliant on
international products and technology
across all sectors. Foreign ownership does
not of course imply malign intent, nor does
it generally mean foreign state control.
Nevertheless, in some cases, there is the
theoretical possibility of state influence
being exercised through such means in
times of tension. The Government will
keep such issues under review to mitigate
against this possibility becoming an actual
vulnerability.

###### Longer term response

**6.11** Building partnerships and improving
relations with other states, multilaterally
and bilaterally, is at the heart of our
approach to foreign policy. The overall
strategic lead on state-led threats therefore
rests with the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office. However, the UK’s significant
military and intelligence capabilities
represent key elements of our response.


**6.12** The UK’s response to the full range of
state-led threats needs to be informed by a
sound understanding of the changing
nature of the threat; be forward thinking
and able to adapt to the future; and draw
on all the capabilities available, including:

�� **Effective diplomacy and strong**
**multilateral relationships**
We place a high premium on diplomacy
and multilateral engagement to reduce the
motivation of potentially hostile states. For
example, the capability of our Armed
Forces, both as a deterrent and
operationally, is magnified greatly by our
leading role in NATO and the EU, and
through our other international military
and security cooperation and development
programmes.

More widely, we are committed to working
multilaterally to develop a strong rulesbased international system, not just to
promote economic growth and
development, but also to mitigate the risk
of another state acting to damage our
economic well-being in a way that poses a
threat to our national security.

�� **Robust trading partnerships**
Strong international trade links and
industrial interdependencies, supported by
Government where appropriate, also
mitigate the risk in this area.

In a trade-driven world, economic
interaction can contribute to reducing the
motivation of potentially hostile states, by
allowing open international markets for
products and services to benefit all
countries. These trading relationships also
have the effect of enhancing the position
of the UK and its economy.

�� **Our Armed Forces**
The UK’s military capability is fundamental
to our ability to counter state-led threats
and we remain committed to retaining
robust, expeditionary and flexible armed
forces for the foreseeable future. Our


-----

conventional military capabilities also act as
a significant deterrent to potential nonnuclear state-led threats.

As noted in Chapter 4, we assess that no
country currently has the capability and
intent to threaten the UK with nuclear
weapons. We believe that the best way to
ensure that this position endures is to work
towards a safer world in which there are
no such weapons. But given the continuing
risk posed by proliferation, and the
certainty that a number of other countries
will retain substantial nuclear arsenals, we
believe it is premature to judge that a
nuclear threat to our national security will
not arise in future. As a result, a minimum
strategic deterrent capability is likely to
remain a necessary element of our national
security for the foreseeable future.

�� **Our Security and Intelligence**
**Agencies**
Some hostile state actions, particularly in
times of conflict or heightened tension,
could be carried out overtly but many will
be covert. Our security and intelligence
agencies, together with those of our allies,
play a critical role both in providing insight
and early warning on states’ capabilities
and intent and in enabling us to best
mitigate or defend ourselves against
specific threats.

�� **Our underpinning domestic**
**legislative and regulatory**
**framework**
The Government works collaboratively
with the organisations which maintain our
critical infrastructure and provide key
services within the United Kingdom to
ensure that the interests of consumers are
protected. This approach is underpinned by
a robust regulatory framework.

And ultimately, through the Enterprise Act
(2002), the Civil Contingencies Act (2004)
and the Energy Act (2005), the UK
Government has the legislative powers


required to intervene should it have
significant concerns on national security
grounds about the acquisition of elements
of its critical national infrastructure, or to
take control of that infrastructure in the
event of an actual or threatened
emergency.

###### Priorities for the future

**6.13** As the nature of possible future
state-led threats to the UK evolves in both
the military and non-military domains, our
capability to respond to any such threats
needs also to develop. Our priorities,
therefore, include:

�� continued commitment to multilateral
relationships and international trading
partnerships;

�� taking forward the recommendations of
the Cyber Security Strategy to ensure
the safety and security of citizens,
business and Government in cyber
space;

�� strengthening further the mechanisms
for collective decision making across
Government on all aspects of nonmilitary state-led threats;

�� in partnership with industry, working to
strengthen the UK’s industrial capability
in technologies critical to our
infrastructure and defence assets, and
hence our national security;

�� maintaining the global reach of our
security and intelligence agencies
through continued investment in
existing and new capabilities;

�� maintaining the capability of our Armed
Forces by ensuring they remain agile,
deployable, highly trained and are held
at high readiness against a range of
contingencies;

�� maintaining the credibility and utility of
our alliances, especially a reformed


-----

NATO, including our contribution to
strong multilateral forces;

�� continuing to invest in maintaining a
qualitative military advantage over
potential state adversaries in
technological, doctrinal and structural
terms; and

�� maintaining a minimum strategic
deterrent capability, currently
represented by Trident.

###### Global instability and conflict, and failed and fragile states

**6.14** Instability and violence overseas can
pose a threat to the UK, its citizens and
way of life, both directly and indirectly. Our
well-being is derived from trade, security of
our energy supplies and commercial
interests – all of which can be severely
interrupted by conflict within or between
states. What happens in a state where law
and order has broken down or is under
pressure can have a direct impact on
security at home, through the spread of
organised crime, drugs, the growth of
extremism, or the effects of migration. And
our citizens rightly expect us to take action
to uphold security and justice, to promote
legitimate and accountable government
and support for human rights.

**6.15** No two conflicts are the same. The
factors that cause tension in one country
or region to boil over into violent conflict
will not mirror those in another. Nor will
any two conflicts require the same
interventions to prevent violence, bring it
to an end, or to stop it recurring. Our
understanding of the drivers and
implications of instability and violent
conflict and how to reduce conflict
continues to develop. For example, the
likely consequences of climate change,
such as migration, crop failure, damage to
energy infrastructure, decreasing fresh
water supplies and increasing poverty,
could displace populations and exacerbate


existing conflict in already vulnerable
regions.

**6.16** Instability and violent conflict
overseas provide an opportunity for other
threats such as terrorism and organised
crime to flourish. Much of the current
wave of international terrorism is
connected to disputes and conflicts where
the international community has found it
difficult to broker resolution. Palestine,
Afghanistan, Chechnya, Lebanon, Kashmir,
and Iraq have become focal points for
terrorism over the past 20 years. Terrorist
groups can thrive in fragile and failed
states where the infrastructure of terrorism
may flourish, where terrorist organisations
not only run training facilities but also
provide material support, protection and
sometimes quasi-governmental services to
the local population. Al Qa‘ida grew under
the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and it’s
senior leadership now operates out of the
Federally Administered Tribal Areas of
Pakistan. Al Qa‘ida affiliates exploit areas in
Yemen, the Sahel, and Somalia where the
writ of the state is undermined. Failed
states are also prone to insurgencies where
non-state organisations, such as the
Taliban, pose a specific threat to the
integrity of a state or portions of its
territory.

**6.17** Our approach to conflict is to work
across government bringing together the
full range of development, diplomatic and
military tools aligned to wider Government
(and multinational) priorities, working
together towards common goals. The FCO,
MoD and DFID jointly deliver the
Government’s key public service agreement
(PSA): our commitment to reduce the
impact of conflict through enhanced UK
and international efforts. Our efforts must
be prioritised on those conflicts which
most affect UK interests and citizens and
where the UK is most able to make a
difference. Our priorities under the PSA
include Afghanistan and Pakistan, Africa,


-----

including Sudan and the Horn of Africa,
the Middle East and the Balkans as
priorities for UK engagement.

###### Global instability and conflict – the past year

**6.18** Violent conflict and serious instability
between and especially within states
persists. Both state and non-state actors
engage in conflict, and because the
implications of intra-state conflict can
reach beyond the borders of a particular
state, internationalised intra-state conflicts
are also prevalent. The conflict between
Russia and Georgia in 2008 has shown
how conflicts can suddenly erupt and
become an international priority for action.
Israel’s invasion of Gaza in response to
Hamas rocket fire into Israel highlighted
the importance of sustaining international


efforts to achieve political solutions to
entrenched conflicts.

**6.19** It is not yet clear what effect the
global economic downturn will have on
conflict affected and fragile states or on
the international community’s ability and
willingness to address it. Economic factors
alone are unlikely to cause new conflicts.
But the crisis has increased the vulnerability
of countries highly dependent on external
financing, commodity exports or
remittances. And it is likely that it will
further reduce the ability of weak or fragile
states to deal with or absorb external and
internal shocks.

###### Future Challenges and the Longer Term Response

**6.20** We will improve and integrate our
early warning mechanisms for conflict,
trends analysis and planning processes


###### Global instability and conflict, and failing and fragile states: Government progress on commitments in the past year
**Delivering the Government’s PSA on conflict and building the capacity of weak**
**states and regional organisations to prevent and resolve conflicts**
�� Through a broad programme set out in our public service agreement (PSA), we
have provided support to conflict affected regions including Sudan, the Horn of
Africa, Sierra Leone, Democratic Republic of Congo, the Balkans, the Middle East,
Afghanistan and Iraq.

**Strengthening UN capacity for conflict prevention, mediation, stabilisation,**
**recovery and peace-building**
�� We strongly support the UN’s role in international peacekeeping and
peacebuilding. We are working with others to ensure the UN Security Council
develops a more strategic approach and strengthens linkages between the two.
On peacekeeping, we have three main objectives: to ensure that the UN Security
Council’s peacekeeping mandates are rigorous, incorporating robust military
advice, and early consultation with troop contributing nations; working to ensure
that current and future peacekeeping operations are properly resourced. With our
encouragement, the UN’s Peacekeeping Department has started work on a major
report on the future of UN peacekeeping called A New Horizon for Peacekeeping.
On peacebuilding we have built international consensus to address three critical
challenges in support to countries emerging from conflict: strategic leadership,
rapid flexible funding and civilian resources.


-----

_Global instability and conflict, and failing and fragile states: Government_
_progress on commitments in the past year (continued)_
**Strengthening EU capacity for conflict prevention, mediation, stabilisation,**
**recovery and peace-building**
�� Many of the security challenges the UK faces are common to those of Europe as
a whole. This is reflected clearly through the shared approach to security in the
National Security Strategy and the European Security Strategy, first endorsed by
the European Council in 2003 and reaffirmed in December 2008. Both recognise
the key threats posed by proliferation, terrorism and regional and global conflict.
Both also acknowledge the increasing complexity and interdependence of the
threats and challenges we face, the importance of multilateral solutions to them
and the particular importance of climate change and competition for energy as
drivers of future insecurity.

�� Working with European partners we have secured agreement at the December
European Council on the creation of a single civilian and military strategic level
planning structure for European security and defence policy (ESDP) missions and
operations.

**Enhancing ability to deploy civilians and increased civilian-military integration**
�� The UK has also provided police and civilian UK secondments to key international
institutions including the UN, the EU and Organisation for Security Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) in 2008/9. To underpin further our ability to contribute more
widely to international civilian missions and to operate nationally alongside British
or NATO forces, for example in Afghanistan, the UK is also developing a more
robust standby capability of civilians with different areas of expertise, including
800 stabilisation experts, a cadre of around 200 conflict and stabilisation experts
within the civil service, and a wider network of professionals willing to assist in
conflict affected environments. This capacity will be fully established by the end
of 2009.


across government departments. As well
as engaging early, we will engage
substantively by strengthening governance
in fragile states, supporting reform of
security and justice systems, and
addressing the underlying causes of
conflict. We will also aim for solutions that
are locally-led, and implemented, and
inclusive of local non-governmental
organisations (NGOs) and civil society to
help build effective states, accountable to
their citizens.

**6.21** The United Kingdom will rarely be
the only external actor in a given conflict.
When violence or instability erupts
collective action is most effective and


carries greater legitimacy. The Government
expects responses to fragile and conflict
affected states to be primarily through
multinational institutions (particularly the
UN, NATO, the EU and the African Union)
or with like-minded partner nations. In a
time of increasing pressure and strained
resources, the United Kingdom and France
are leading work, launched in the UN in
January 2009 during the French UN
Security Council Presidency, to develop a
more strategic approach to peacekeeping.
This includes a more coherent approach to
when and how we mandate UN
operations, building the capacity of the UN
and troop contributors, and ensuring that


-----

-----

a peacekeeping operation is part of a
wider and coherent strategy to build
peace. We will be taking this forward
during the UK Presidency of the UN
Security Council in August 2009.

**6.22** Different situations of conflict and
fragility require different tools and
capabilities. The Government will continue
to develop its ability to tackle the
underlying causes of conflict and fragility
through its development and poverty
reduction programmes, through mediation
and other diplomatic approaches as well as
developing more flexible military
capabilities to support stabilisation. The
Government’s enhanced Stabilisation Unit
is supporting delivery of our programmes
in a range of key target countries, through
both bilateral and multilateral cooperation.
By the end of the year, we will have
established a one thousand strong civilian
standby capability to deploy in support of
stabilisation and conflict prevention in
priority areas.


**6.23** Government departments are already
working together to deliver the Public
Service Agreement to reduce the impact of
conflict through UK and international
efforts. We will be developing that work
further to ensure we have a coherent
conflict strategy which sets out a strategic
approach to preventing and responding to
conflict.

**6.24** Encouraging international partners
and organisations to take a strategic
approach to conflict will be essential in
ensuring that the international system can
develop its capacity to tackle conflict early
and use scarce resources more effectively
and efficiently.


###### Afghanistan and Pakistan

The challenges facing Afghanistan and Pakistan are substantial and complex: ranging
from strengthening security, to improving governance and basic services, reducing
poverty and promoting growth, and protecting human rights, including women’s
rights. But it is vital to the region, to global security and to our own security, that
these challenges are met. The situation in both countries has changed significantly in
the past year, and we have adapted our activities across development, diplomacy
and defence, as part of an integrated approach – set out in the new joint strategy
_Afghanistan and Pakistan: The Way Forward in April this year. This strategy sets out_
a multi-strand approach, covering improving security in the face of a complex
insurgency with links between the two countries, building more effective and
accountable governance, strengthening the rule of law, and an innovative approach
to development in an often insecure environment. The strategy also recognises that
in all these areas, efforts must be led by the Afghan and Pakistani governments
themselves, with the international community’s support.


-----

_Afghanistan and Pakistan (continued)_

In Afghanistan, we are playing a leading role: there are currently 8,300 UK troops
in Afghanistan. This number will temporarily rise to 9,000, to provide extra security
during the Presidential election, and will return to an enduring maximum of 8,300 in
2010. In Helmand, where the majority of our troops are based, the UK is in the lead
in the joint military-civilian Provincial Reconstruction team. At both national level and
in Helmand we are focused increasingly on building Afghan capacity, so that
Afghans can take control of their own security, governance and development. Over
time, the UK will shift the balance of its military effort away from front line combat
and towards training the Afghan police and army. This will be integrated with civilian
efforts to help build effective and accountable Afghan governance, tackle the drugs
trade, improve the rule of law, and basic services. We are committed to
strengthening Afghan democracy at all levels, including by providing support for
credible and inclusive elections this year, and backing the Afghan government as it
takes forward efforts to tackle corruption and reconciliation. We will increase our
support for sub-national governance and rule of law, including helping governors
reach out to the traditional tribal system through local shuras.

In Helmand, coordination between government departments is significantly
improved, showing how we have adapted to the challenge of delivering
development and governance support in difficult security conditions. We now
have 80 deployed civilians experts, double the number a year ago, working in a
joint civilian-military headquarters to a joint plan for the key population centres.
DFID support to Helmand will help 400,000 people with clean water, better roads,
improved electricity, and support for legal agriculture and other opportunities to earn
a decent wage.

In Pakistan, UK policy is based on principles shared with the Government of
Pakistan, which include the need for long-term good governance and economic
development, as well as providing security and tackling terrorism. To help meet these
needs, the UK and Pakistan recently established a Strategic Dialogue, which provides
a framework for working together at a senior level on high priority issues of security,
economic prosperity and poverty reduction. Increased cooperation on security and
diplomatic issues is complemented by the UK’s development assistance to Pakistan,
which focuses greater attention on the basic human challenges Pakistan faces. That
is why the UK has increased development assistance to Pakistan to £665 million over
the next four years, providing more support for education and health, making
government more effective and making growth work for everyone. This will
contribute to 5 million more children in primary school and train 15,000 health
facility staff. Increasing our work in the areas of Pakistan that border Afghanistan
(especially on education, governance and economic opportunities) will also help the
Government of Pakistan to tackle grievances that can fuel violent extremism.
Maintaining long-term vision and commitment will be essential. The success of UK
and international efforts to help the Governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan bring
stability, democratic governance and prosperity to the region depends on it.


-----

###### Terrorists & Terrorism

**6.25** This section of the Strategy concerns
terrorists and other non-state actors, such
as insurgents, who may threaten our
security. Currently the threat from
international terrorism is the most
significant immediate security threat to the
United Kingdom.

###### Terrorism – the past year

**6.26** Since the publication of the National
Security Strategy, terrorist attacks have
been carried out in the UK by dissident
Irish republican terrorists, with the murder
of two soldiers and a policeman in
Northern Ireland this year. Nonetheless, the
threat by individuals and groups linked to
or inspired by Al Qa’ida continues to
represent the pre-eminent terrorist threat
to the UK and our interests. We know that
conducting a successful attack against the
UK remains a priority for the Al Qa’ida
leadership and that, despite significant
disruption by the police and the security
and intelligence agencies, planning and
attempts to carry out attacks against us
continue.

**6.27** The international terrorist threat
originates primarily from four sources: the
Al Qa’ida leadership and their immediate
associates, located mainly on the Pakistan/
Afghanistan border; terrorist groups
affiliated to Al Qa’ida in North and East
Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, Iraq and
Yemen; ‘self starting’ networks and lone
individuals motivated by an ideology similar
to that of Al Qa’ida, but with no
connection to that organisation; and
terrorist groups that follow a broadly
similar ideology as Al Qa’ida but which
have their own identity and regional
agenda. Al Qa’ida and associated terrorists
aspire to attack without warning and they
aim to cause mass casualties. They are
actively seeking to recruit new members.
We believe that they are prepared to use
unconventional techniques where they can


develop a capability to do so (including
chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear
weapons).

**6.28** Overseas, the past year has seen a
deteriorating security situation in Pakistan,
with over 60 suicide attacks in 2008. We
have an immediate counter-terrorism
interest in Pakistan because the Senior
Leadership of Al Qa’ida continues to
operate from havens in the border areas
near Afghanistan. More widely the UK has
important national interests in Pakistan
that are founded in our historical
association with the Indian sub-continent,
the close familial links between many UK
and Pakistani citizens and the importance
of a stable Pakistan to Afghanistan and the
wider region. These interests are
threatened by the presence of Al Qa’ida
and the continuing Taliban insurgency in
Pakistan.

**6.29** Elsewhere, Al Qa’ida and Al Qa’ida
associated groups have been active in
Yemen, East Africa and the Mahgreb. In
November 2008, India suffered a serious
terrorist attack in Mumbai by 10 terrorists
whom the Government believes were
trained and directed by Lashkar e Taiba,
based in Pakistan. The attack, which killed
at least 160 people and injured over 300,
demonstrated key hallmarks of modern
terrorism: it was an attack on soft targets;
it was designed to cause large numbers of
civilian casualties; it required careful
planning and command and control; and it
exploited the media for propaganda.

###### Counter-Terrorism: Government progress on commitments in the past year

**Increasing capability to detect and disrupt terrorists**

�� The Government published its updated CONTEST Strategy for countering
international terrorism. This set out for the first time in a public document our
view of the history and development of the current threat for the UK, our detailed
approach to countering the threat from international terrorism, and our key
successes to date.

�� The Government has continued with its programme of significant investment in
the intelligence and security services. Since 2001, the Security Service has doubled
in size, Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) Terrorism Team has
grown significantly and additionally Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) resources have
enhanced front-line counter-terrorism operations overseas. In the past year, the
Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC) has also grown by 10 per cent.

�� On 1 April 2009 a fourth Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU) in the Thames Valley
became operational. This was established by expanding the size and capability of
the previous South East Counter Terrorism Intelligence Unit.

**Enhancing protection against terrorism provided by the new UK border agency**

�� The United Kingdom Borders Agency (UKBA) now has more than 25,000 staff
with a presence in 135 countries. Within UKBA, a new unified UK Border Force
presents the primary face of Government at the border and comprises almost
9,000 staff.

�� The £1.2 billion e-Borders system has screened over 90 million passengers
travelling to the UK, using data received from approximately 105 carriers on over
185 routes. This has led to over 40,000 alerts and over 3,200 arrests for all
crimes, not specifically terrorist charges, and has allowed the resources of the
border agencies to be targeted better on those intending harm to the public in
the UK or to deceive UK authorities.

**Increasing capacity to deal with the consequences of a terrorist attack**

�� Counter-terrorism security advisors have run over 900 scenario-based training
events for city and town centre businesses to help them identify measures they
can take to protect themselves, and their customers, and to recover from a
terrorist attack should one occur.

**Tackling violent extremism and challenging the violent extremist narrative**

�� The revised Prevent Strategy and an associated Guide for Local Partners in
England were published in May 2008.

�� A toolkit for schools on preventing violent extremism was published in October 2008
by the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF). This is complemented
by two sets of guidance published in February 2009 to enable higher and further
educational institutions to reduce the risks of radicalisation on campus.

###### Future Challenges and the Longer Term Response

**6.30** For the foreseeable future, Al Qa’ida
and its associates are likely to remain the
pre-eminent threat to the UK, although the
Al Qa’ida ‘core’ organisation may not
survive in its current form. If the very top
leadership (Osama bin Laden and Ayman al
Zawahiri) were killed or captured it would
cause significant disruption in the short
term and lead to changes in Al Qa’ida’s
structure and command and control but
would not necessarily make the broader
movement less lethal. A fragmentation in
the core group of Al Qa’ida may cause a
diversification of the threat in the UK:
self-starting organisations, old Al Qa’ida
affiliates and other terrorist groups may all
become more important. Over time,
Al Qa’ida affiliates are likely to develop
greater autonomy and continue to
gravitate towards and to challenge fragile
and failing states, where it will be difficult,
and at times impossible, to conduct
conventional law enforcement counterterrorist operations.

**6.31** We cannot predict what causes or
ideologies will give rise to terrorism in the
future. Some of the factors that sustain the
current pattern of international terrorism
are likely to persist. Many of the conflicts
and disputes exploited by contemporary
terrorist organisations show no signs of
early resolution, and failing states (or areas
with failing governance) are likely to
remain a factor for the foreseeable future.
Grievances will continue to make some
people in the Islamic world vulnerable to
the political agenda associated with
Al Qa’ida, and small numbers may be
prepared to support Al Qa’ida’s operational
activities.

**6.32** Globalisation, the Internet and the
increasing ease of travel will increase the
extent to which territorially driven or
constrained grievances are played out on


a worldwide stage. The UK may be
particularly exposed to this risk because we
are a very open and diverse society with
numerous diaspora communities. Political
events in countries thousands of miles
away are closely reflected in communities
in the UK. Because of the worldwide
spread of our interests, and our
dependence on the stability that enables
international trade, we have a particular
vulnerability where terrorist attacks
threaten or damage stability and the
peaceful and ordered conduct of affairs
overseas.

**6.33** It is probable that terrorist
organisations will develop greater access to
increasingly lethal technology. Scientific
training and expertise will have significance
for terrorist organisations as technology
enables an asymmetric approach to
methods of attack. While interdependent,
open and networked societies benefit
greatly from the strengths and resilience
that arise from information sharing, cooperation and efficiency, it is also the case
that such societies present unique
opportunities for people to cause harm.
Furthermore, technology will allow
terrorists to compensate for some of their
vulnerabilities, although it will also
generate new opportunities for intelligence
gathering and disruption. These changes
have implications for the shape, size and
capability of our security, intelligence and
law enforcement agencies.

**6.34** As well as potentially easing access
to more lethal effects, technology enables
the use by terrorist groups to communicate
in ways that have long been key to their
delivering mass effect, but which are now
easier than ever to achieve; for example by
the posting of propaganda on videosharing websites. We know how much
importance Al Qa’ida places on
communications and the exploitation and
manipulation of information.


-----

**6.35** A major component of our current
counter-terrorism strategy seeks to
challenge the ideology that drives Al Qa’ida
inspired violent extremism. Whilst terrorism
will always be a method by which groups
may seek to influence the political process
through violence, we can challenge
Al Qa’ida’s distorted interpretation of Islam,
exposing its inaccuracies and shortcomings
in order to reduce the support and
motivation which Al Qa’ida and associated
groups rely on for their survival.

**6.36** The lines between terrorism,
subversion and legitimate dissent and
protest may become increasingly blurred.
This presents a particular and complex
challenge to liberal democracies. We may
face challenges from non-state actors –
whether motivated by ideology or not – who
employ the methods and tactics of terrorists
but do not conform to historical models of
terrorist groups. It is arguable that we are
already experiencing this in Al Qa’ida and
associated groups that lack an obviously
realisable political objective. It is important
that we challenge material and arguments
which create a climate of intolerance and
distrust in which violence as a tool of
political discourse becomes acceptable, as
well as disrupting and prosecuting those
who directly incite violence. We will not
undermine our commitment to freedom of
speech, which allows individuals and
organisations with extreme and even
intolerant views to express them, but we will
work to ensure that the hollowness of these
views is revealed.

**6.37** Terrorists can harness new
technology and develop new techniques
for communication and recruitment which
makes them increasingly hard to identify
and disrupt. In such circumstances, various
forms of covert and intrusive surveillance
become increasingly important. Yet while
we must develop and deliver a strategy,


structures and capabilities that both
address the immediate threat and that are
resilient and flexible enough to cope with
and adapt to the threats we are likely to
face in the coming decade, this must not
be at the expense of the principles of the
UK as a liberal democracy. These include a
commitment to individual privacy. As the
debates around changes to our laws,
measures to enable surveillance and their
relationship to civil liberties underline, this
is an ongoing challenge. To ensure that all
measures we adopt are proportionate to
the threat and necessary to the
management of it, we have, and will
maintain, strict rules governing the use of
surveillance and independent oversight of
the application of these rules.

**6.38** The Government’s response to both
the immediate and the future threat is the
Strategy for countering international
terrorism – CONTEST. In existence since
2003, the Strategy’s aim is “to reduce the
risk to the UK and its interests overseas
from international terrorism, so that people
can go about their lives freely and with
confidence.” Details of this strategy were
made public in July 2006.

**6.39** The Government believes that the
strategy continues to achieve its intended
aim. Over the past six years we have
greatly improved our ability to prevent,
detect and disrupt terrorism, protect our
people and the structures which underpin
their daily lives, and to manage the
consequences of attacks when they do
happen. However since 2003 both the
threat and our understanding of it have
evolved, we have learned lessons about
our response and committed significantly
greater resources to counter-terrorism.
To reflect this changing context the
Government has revised CONTEST and in
March published the updated version of
the strategy (Cm 7547)[28].

###### CONTEST

Delivery of the UK’s strategy for countering the threat from international terrorism –
CONTEST – depends upon a unique and ground-breaking range of local, national
and international partners.

Arrangements in the West Midlands are representative of the steps we have taken at
the regional level across the UK to deliver an integrated response. Under a regional
CONTEST Board, the Government Office for the West Midlands (GOWM), brings
together Home Office representatives, West Midlands Police, Regional Offender
Managers, UK Border Agency (UKBA), Youth Justice Board, Public Health,
representatives for Children & Young People and the Regional Resilience Forum.

A key strand of CONTEST, known as PREVENT, aims to stop people from becoming
radicalised. At a local level, we are working with communities to develop Prevent
projects which, under the framework of the national Prevent Strategy[31], provide
effective support to vulnerable people at risk of radicalisation. Channel is one such
programme. Run in a partnership between the regional Counter Terrorism Units
(CTUs), local authorities, statutory and community partners, it aims to provide a focus
for public sector professionals and members of the community to refer individuals of
concern to a multi-agency risk assessment and case management system, bringing to
bear a variety of resources and expertise to counter radicalisation.

The Civil Contingencies Secretariat, in the Cabinet Office, is leading work to develop
partnerships at local, regional and national level in preparation for all kinds of civil
emergencies. The increased focus of this work on community and corporate
resilience will aid local groups and organisations to respond to terrorist attacks as
well as other common hazards; local groups and networks are best placed to identify
people who may be vulnerable, local places of safety, and local resources of skills
and material than can be used in any kind of civil emergency.

We also recognise that the expertise and knowledge held by citizens, industry and
the third sector is vital to delivery. The Centre for Protection of National Infrastructure
works with a range of Government Departments, the Devolved Administrations and
public and private sector organisations to provide integrated advice on physical,
personnel and electronic security to partners who own or operate infrastructure in
order to protect the UK from terrorist attack.

But we also need to work overseas, just as much as at home, in order to understand
the process of radicalisation, to reduce the vulnerability of our diaspora communities
and the countries and regions from which they come. Our response has increased
significantly in scale over the last two years; Foreign and Commonwealth Office
spending alone on Prevent overseas has more than doubled. It has also widened in
scope, with support from the Department for International Development and the
British Council, and more international work by the Home Office and the
Department for Communities and Local Government. The work of the Armed Forces
and engagement with and through international partners and multilateral
organisations are clearly also critical.


29 HM Government, Preventing Violent Extremism: A Strategy for Delivery (2008); available at
http://security.homeoffice.gov.uk/news-publications/publication-search/prevent-strategy


-----

**6.40** CONTEST governs the UK’s domestic
and international response to the
international terrorist threat. It is organised
around four pillars:

�� Pursue: to stop terrorist attacks

�� Prevent: to stop people becoming
terrorists, or supporting violent
extremism

�� Protect: to strengthen our protection
against terrorist attack

�� Prepare: where an attack cannot be
stopped, to mitigate its impact.

**6.41** CONTEST is overseen at Ministerial
level by the Cabinet Committee on
National Security, International Relations
and Development (NSID), chaired by the
Prime Minister (this is the same Cabinet
Committee which oversees the National
Security Strategy); the Home Secretary (or,
as appropriate, the Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland) is the lead minister for
counter terrorism. Some specific aspects of
CONTEST are also dealt with by
subcommittees of NSID.

**6.42** Delivery of the strategy requires close
co-operation between a wide range of
organisations and stakeholders: local
authorities, Government departments,
Devolved Administrations, the police, the
security and intelligence agencies,
emergency services and the Armed Forces
and international partners and multilateral
organisations. Delivery is overseen by a
CONTEST Board, chaired by the Director
General of the Office of Security and
Counter Terrorism (OSCT) in the Home
Office. Representatives from key
Departments and agencies attend the
Board. Each workstream of CONTEST has
a detailed delivery plan, identifying
responsibility for each programme,
projected timescales, benefits and costs.
Within the Home Office OSCT is
responsible for co-ordinating action on


CONTEST by stakeholders across the whole
of Government, and reports on its delivery
against the Counter-Terrorism Public
Service Agreement (26). The 2007
Comprehensive Spending Review
announced increased resources for
counter-terrorism and intelligence.
Counter-terrorism and intelligence
spending is planned to reach £3.5 billion
pa by 2011.

**6.43** The Government believes that in
CONTEST the UK has one of the most
sophisticated and comprehensive strategies
for addressing terrorism in the world.

**6.44** We now have a robust combination
of intellectual framework, capability, and
governance and delivery arrangements
that will allow us to adapt and respond to
threats as they arise and provide the
structures that will enable this strategy to
operate coherently alongside our strategies
for related challenges (such as Serious
Organised Crime, Civil Emergencies,
Stability and Counter Insurgency in key
countries) within the overall approach set
out in the National Security Strategy.

**6.45** The attacks in Northern Ireland this
year show the continued intent of dissident
republicans in the face of the political
progress that has been made in recent
years and which is supported by the
overwhelming majority of the people of
Northern Ireland. The Government’s
response to the continuing threat from
Irish related terrorism is to continue to
support the political process as the means
by which all sides can pursue their political
ambitions by exclusively peaceful means
and to provide the strategic leadership and
the resources in which the law
enforcement and intelligence agencies can
work to reduce the threat from terrorism.
The Government’s response includes close
cooperation with the Irish Government.


-----

**6.46** The key principles for tackling the
threat from Irish related terrorism are
drawn from those which underpin both
the National Security Strategy and the
CONTEST approach to international
terrorism but are applied to the specific
circumstances of Northern Ireland. The
additional investment, increased
capabilities, and improved structures we
have put in place since 2001 to counter
terrorism are available to respond to
threats as they arise.

###### Counter-Terrorism and Counter Insurgency

**6.47** The UK is currently involved in
combat operations in Afghanistan that
continue to expose the complexities of the
modern security environment in which
insurgency and terrorism are woven
together. Similarly, what began in Iraq as
an insurgency became a theatre in which
Al Qa’ida sought to attack not only the
Coalition but Iraqi forces and civilians too,
as part of an ideologically driven campaign
to undermine the progress of democracy
there.

**6.48** In Afghanistan and Pakistan there is a
complex nexus of terrorist and insurgent
groups with similar, though not always
mutually consistent and shared aims. The
continuing radicalisation of Afghan fighters
in Pakistan and the growing network of
extremism orchestrated from the
borderlands between Afghanistan and
Pakistan are all good reasons to consider a
holistic counter-insurgency and counterterrorism approach.

**6.49** Insurgencies in the last century were
largely fought within the boundaries of
single states (though not devoid of outside
influence), and were rarely, if ever, linked
to wider acts of terrorism. Today,
globalisation and the increasing
dependence of societies on international
financial information and communication
networks ensure that grievances and


agendas can pay little heed to
geographical boundaries. This networked
migration of ideas is exploited to fuel both
terrorist and insurgent action. The transfer
we now see of ideas, money, tactics and
personnel between ‘insurgent’ and
‘terrorist’ groups is unprecedented.

**6.50** Al Qa’ida uses local insurgencies and
instability to fuel its narrative of perceived
injustices. We can expect this approach to
continue. Local insurgents turn to Al Qa’ida
for philosophical guidance, finance, tactical
expertise, and practical assistance (for
example in creating sophisticated explosive
devices), and Al Qa’ida relies on indigenous
insurgents for support and shelter in
ungoverned spaces. Personnel recruited
from local populations feed both local
insurgencies and wider international
terrorist campaigns.

**6.51** The current terrorist threat to the UK
comes predominantly from the global
vision of Al Qa’ida and its associates, which
in turn feeds and is fed by local
insurgencies. The symbiotic nature of
insurgency campaigns and the most
prevalent terrorist threats today require us
to design mutually supporting counter
insurgency and counter terrorism
strategies. The core of our approach to
countering international terrorism must be
to resolve local issues and negate the
grievances that feed terrorism: key to this
will be our work to counter insurgency.
Addressing these problems requires a
co-ordinated response from, and is the
responsibility of, the whole of government,
and the wider international community.
Countering terrorism and insurgency
requires an approach that closely ties
together traditional diplomatic, security
and military capabilities and development
resources which are best placed to help
address the underlying grievances. A
strategy that is any less comprehensive will
fail to match the vision, energy and reach
of the adversary.


-----

###### Trans-national organised crime

 The past year

**6.52** Trans-national organised crime is
often seen to operate in an isolated world,
with little consequence for communities
and their citizens. The reality however is
different: it is present in almost every facet
of society and affects the daily lives of UK
citizens. The Home Office estimates that
over £20 billion a year of social and
economic harms to the UK are attributable
to serious organised crime, which affects
local communities through drug-related
crime, gun crime, people-trafficking and
illegal immigration. Globally, the UN
estimates the cost of international
organised crime to business to be
£1 trillion.

**6.53** In Security in an Interdependent
_World the Government highlighted the_
complex nature of trans-national organised
crime. There is no single model for how an
organised crime group is structured.
Serious organised criminals are operating
across international borders and in a
variety of criminal markets. They mirror
ordinary businesses, adopting a portfolio
approach and switching between different
crime types to maximise profitability and
minimise risk.

**6.54** Globalisation, along with its many
benefits, has also provided opportunities
for serious organised criminals. In fact,
globalisation has acted as the main
facilitator of organised crime, increasing
the pace of ‘old’ crimes, such as drugs
trafficking, and enabling ‘new’ crimes such
as fraud via the Internet.


**6.55** The revolution in global
communications and increased movement
of people, goods and ideas has also
enabled criminals to operate from a safe
distance to minimise risk, often in countries
where state authority is weak or
susceptible to corruption. Organised
criminals are increasingly locating in these
areas to evade detection, and once
established, can stimulate vicious circles of
crime, instability and corruption, which
undermine already fragile states. Piracy is
one of the many ways criminals can seek
to gain large sums of money. Although
piracy is a problem in several areas of the
world, the current incidence off the Horn
of Africa is exacerbated by the existence in
Somalia of large expanses of ungoverned
space in which land-based havens for
pirate groups can be established with
relative impunity.

**6.56** Technology is another factor. Online
payments have increased by 400 per cent
in the last five years[30], creating new
opportunities for legitimate businesses and
organised criminals alike. Online banking
fraud grew to over £52 million in 2008, up
from £22.6 million in 2007[31], and the cost
to the UK’s small businesses of online crime
and fraud is approximately £800 to each
such business per year[32]. Card fraud has
also increased by 13 per cent since 2007[33].
This type of fraud is particularly popular
with organised criminals because it can be
committed from a safe distance.

**6.57** Unrestricted by regulation and
scrutiny, the nature of trans-national
organised crime enables it to take
advantage of changing economic


30 The UK Payments Association (APACS) 2007.
31 APACS 2009.
32 Inhibiting Small Enterprise – Report by Federation of Small Businesses 2009 (includes England, Wales and
Scotland).
33 Figures from APACS show that card not present fraud (includes phone and mail order frauds as well as internet
transactions) amounted to £328.4 million in 2008, a 13% increase from 2007, and account for 54 per cent of
all card fraud losses.


-----

conditions in ways that legitimate
businesses can not. Crime groups
operating across borders can exploit
vulnerabilities in international financial
systems to defraud and to launder their
illegal profits.

**6.58** Internationally, organised crime
is enabled by weak governance and
corruption, conditions that may increase
as a result of the global economic
downturn. Domestically, there is early
evidence to suggest that crime types are
evolving as criminals take advantage of
new markets and new opportunities. For
example, demand for loan sharking has
increased, and there is already evidence of
a proliferation of counterfeit goods in the
shadow economy.

###### Future Challenges and the Government’s Longer Term Response

**6.59** Over the 20 year horizon, advances
in technology, and in particular the
internet, will continue to be important in
defining both crime types and the modus
_operandi of trans-national organised_
criminals.

**6.60** As we look to the future, serious
organised criminals will continue to adapt
to take advantage of new technology and
exploit new markets:

�� Unless we act coherently and
collectively, there is a risk, for example,
that the growth in online social
networking may present opportunities
to plan and commit crime or that the
growing interconnectedness of global
markets may provide greater
opportunities for financial fraud;

�� The predicted ‘youth-bulge’ in many
developing countries may provide


stimulus for migration, with resultant
impact on the UK through organised
immigration crime and people
trafficking;

�� Increased competition for resources,
potentially rising commodity prices and
rise of environmental regulations over
the coming decades may create new
markets for organised crime; and

�� There is some evidence to suggest an
overlap of methods between terrorism
and organised criminal groups, in
particular around how they fund their
operations, for example through drug
trafficking and counterfeiting[34].

**6.61** Organised criminals are uniquely
agile in seizing new opportunities for illegal
gain. The Government’s approach to the
challenges of serious organised crime, both
domestically and internationally, therefore,
needs to be ahead of the threat.

**6.62** As well as creating new crime types,
the advances in technology provide
opportunities for Government in its
response. In recognition of this changing
context, and in line with our commitment
to continue to learn and invest, the Home
Office and Cabinet Office have recently
concluded a joint review of organised
crime. The review identifies opportunities
to build on the successes we have already
had and improve further our response to
the new threats and challenges.

**6.63** The Home Office will shortly publish
a new strategy on serious organised crime,
reviewing the Government’s response to
the threat, doing more to tackle it overseas
and creating a more hostile environment
for serious organised criminals within the
UK.

###### Trans-national organised crime: Government progress on commitments in the past year

**Increasing recovery of organised criminal assets**

�� Over £500 million of criminal assets have been recovered since the Proceeds of
Crime Act 2002 came into force in 2003. There has been a five fold increase in
the value of assets recovered between 2003 and 2007, and a total of £136
million was recovered in 2007-08. Provisional figures for 2008/09 show a further
record increase in assets recovered, but are still below trajectory in relation to the
target to recover £250 million in 2009/10.

�� £175 million worth of assets have been denied to UK criminals by the Serious
Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) through a combination of cash seizure, restraint
orders and property freezing orders, and £88 million worth of assets denied to
criminals overseas.

**Strengthening the European response**

�� Internationally we have worked to strengthen EUROPOL and EUROJUST35,
through the introduction of two new legal instruments (the EU Council
Framework on Europol, which replaces the Europol Convention and the amended
EU Council Decision on Eurojust).

**Enhancing targeting of criminals at our borders**

�� Since the UK Border Agency commenced the implementation of checks against
the Interpol Stolen and Lost Transport Documents database in October 2008,
there have been 4932 hits and 2127 documents seized. Checks against the
database are undertaken pre-entry (visa applications), on-entry (at the border) and
in-country (applications for extensions of stay and residency).

**Tackling the illicit trafficking of drugs**

�� Working with international and domestic partners, SOCA was involved in the
interdiction of over 85 tonnes of cocaine last year, and there is new forensic
evidence to suggest a drop in street level purity of the drug.[36]

�� The Armed Forces continue to support SOCA and international partners and
agencies to combat the trafficking of drugs. Royal Navy vessels in the Atlantic and
Caribbean, and RAF Nimrod MR2 and E3D aircraft play an important role in joint
operations. From April 2008 to March 2009, the Royal Navy and RAF have
assisted in the seizure and destruction of about 13 tonnes of cocaine[37]. Not all of
this cocaine was destined for the UK, but, if it had reached our streets, it would
be worth in the region of £520 million.


35 EUROJUST is an agency of the European Union (EU) charged with improving judicial co-operation.
36 SOCA 2008/09 performance figures.
37 This figure is included in the SOCA overall cocaine intercept figure.


-----

**6.64** Domestically this will mean:

�� **A more hostile environment for**
**organised criminals: we will engage**
all the levers at the Government’s
disposal to attack the spaces in which
organised criminals operate, such as
closing down outwardly legitimate
businesses used for criminal purposes,
using tax investigation powers to pin
down elusive criminals, or blocking the
use of mobile phones by organised
criminals within prisons. This will require
a combined effort by Her Majesty’s
Revenue & Customs (HMRC), local
authorities, regulatory bodies, the
National Offender Management Service
and law enforcement agencies to
identify ways to disrupt the interests of
organised criminals at all possible
opportunities.

�� **A more ambitious approach to asset**
**recovery: we will take the attack on**
criminal finances one step further by
mainstreaming its application in
organised crime cases, shifting the
burden of proof on civil recovery cases,
and increasing the flexibility of law
enforcement to use whatever tool
works, criminal or civil, to recover illegal
assets.

�� **A more strategic policy response to**
**serious organised crime: we will learn**
from the lessons of CONTEST, the Home
Office will sharpen and strengthen the
response to serious organised crime. It
will work with key delivery partners to
increase coordination across
Government, identify and respond to
new and emergent threats, and support
law enforcement in targeting the
organised criminals harming this
country.


**6.65** Internationally:

�� **A more targeted approach to**
**international strategy. This will be**
achieved through closer working
between the Home Office and the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office
(FCO), and by strengthening the crossGovernment forum on international
crime that identifies where best to
intervene overseas to reduce harms to
the UK. This means our international
strategies against organised crime will
be better aligned, better tied to
domestic efforts and make better use of
the range of capabilities available to
embassies, missions and law
enforcement overseas.

�� **Better coordinated spending**
**overseas. The Government agencies**
that have a role to play against
organised crime overseas – SOCA,
UKBA, the FCO and the Crown
Prosecution Service – will work in
concert to combat the threat by
coordinating their activities and
identifying collaborative opportunities.
The FCO and DFID will coordinate
their objectives against organised crime
in weak and failing states and continue
to work together to aid these fragile
countries. The Home Office and SOCA
will explore the extent to which SOCA
can allocate more resources overseas to
ensure we are doing all we can to
attack organised crime at source.

�� **A stronger international response to**
**the finances of organised crime: we**
will work with partner countries to
develop the role and reach of the
international Financial Action Task Force
(FATF) in reducing global money
laundering. The Government will step


-----

up efforts to coordinate international
asset recovery partnerships and take an
aggressive approach to attacking the
illegal finances of overseas criminals
that pass through the UK. This will
make the UK an unwelcome home for
those wishing to do business in
organised crime.

�� **Closer working with international**
**partners. The UK will work with**
European partners to deliver a
strengthened role for Europol, acting as
an information hub for all EU-level
enforcement agencies, which will lead
to a step change in Europe’s ability to
respond to organised crime. In addition,
and as detailed in the new Cyber
Security Strategy published alongside
this document, the Home Office and
the new Office for Cyber Security will
review the Government’s response to
e-crime, a significant element of which
is both organised and international. This
will consider how the Government will
respond to online crime in partnership
with the private sector.

###### Civil Emergencies

**6.66** In addition to ‘malicious’ threat
actors outlined earlier, natural disasters and
accidents, collectively known as hazards,
can pose a significant disruptive challenge
to our way of life. Work to address these
challenges (including malicious threats) has
been underway for many years but the
National Risk Register (NRR) published last
summer, outlined in more detail the
potentially wide ranging impacts that
events such as an influenza pandemic or
widespread coastal flooding could have on
the UK’s citizens.


###### Civil emergencies – the past year

**6.67** The types of civil emergencies
outlined in the Government’s National
Security Strategy and NRR are based on the
more detailed five year projection of risks
facing the UK. These are contained in the
classified National Risk Assessment. As a
result of these projections, the risk profile
for the UK has not significantly shifted
during the past year. Overall the risk profile
continues to be diverse, with no single risk
dominating. It also remains complex and
unpredictable, with links randomly and
suddenly emerging between previously
unconnected events, such as the links
between the flooding in summer 2007 and
the subsequent foot and mouth outbreak.

**6.68** Over the past year the economic
situation has also presented challenges to
our ability to deliver improved resilience;
with many businesses and organisations
facing difficult questions about
prioritisation of their resources. However,
in terms of civil emergencies, the picture in
the UK still compares favourably with many
other parts of the world which are prone
to much more frequent natural disasters
on a catastrophic scale (such as flooding
and earthquakes) or which are less well
prepared to deal with the consequences.

**6.69** Sir Michael Pitt’s Review into the
2007 flooding was published in June 2008
and the Government issued its response in
December of that year. The response
outlined an action plan covering all six
themes of the review: identifying when
and where flooding will occur; improved
planning to reduce the risk and impact of
flooding; changes to rescue and care
arrangements; protection and maintenance
of critical services; better advice to the
public on protection of their families and
homes; and improving the recovery


-----

process. The Government has also
announced some £2.15 billion funding for
improved flood risk management and
resilience to 2011.

**6.70** On pandemic ‘flu the UK has
continued to increase preparedness to
ensure we remain one of the best prepared
countries in the world – a position which
has been validated by the World Health
Organization (WHO). This has included
stockpiling antivirals ensuring that every
National Health Service Trust and Local
Resilience Forum has specific plans in place


for a pandemic and publishing a suite of
guidance to assist planners covering
management of excess deaths, school
closures, infection control, the judicial
system, local and health responses, as well
as guidance to businesses.

**6.71** The Government also launched its
pandemic preparedness international
strategy in October 2008 which is the first
of its kind and sets the priorities for the
Government’s work with international
organisations over the next three years.


###### ‘Swine flu’ and other new or emerging infectious diseases

The response to the current swine ‘flu outbreak is a clear demonstration of the
benefits of working together at all levels to prepare for the risks we face. Over the
last few years the Government has worked with the wider resilience community
including the health sector, emergency services, local and regional resilience
planners, the devolved administrations, businesses and the international community,
to ensure that we have robust but flexible plans in place to deal with an influenza
pandemic in whatever form it may take. This has meant that the nation-wide
response to the current outbreak has been rapid and co-ordinated. Work continues
through the established relationships at national and international levels to ensure
that we are in the best place to handle the further challenges this outbreak may
present as it evolves.

In 2008, the National Risk Register identified an influenza-type pandemic as posing
a very high risk to the UK population. The Register also assessed other kinds of
infectious diseases, either new or emerging, that could pose a risk to the health of
the UK population and are therefore monitored, and included in the National Risk
Assessment. Over the past 25 years, more than 30 new or newly-recognised
infections have been identified around the world. Recent scientific studies suggest
it is relatively unlikely that a new infectious disease would originate in the UK, but
possible ‘hot-spots’ for novel infections elsewhere in the world could lead one to
emerge in another country and spread rapidly before it is detected and be
transmitted to the UK. SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) is an example.
The Department of Health has developed contingency plans for dealing with SARS,
which builds on our generic response to outbreaks of infectious disease. Early
recognition of a new infection is crucial as is international collaboration and the
deployment of surveillance and monitoring systems.

The remit of the Health Protection Agency’s (HPA) Centre for Infections includes
infectious disease surveillance, detection and diagnosis, as well as the public health
risks and necessary preventive and control measures; the HPA collaborates with other
international surveillance bodies, undertaking horizon-scanning to enable a rapid
response to any international health alerts.

###### Civil Emergencies: Government progress on commitments in the past year

**Increasing expenditure on flood management in England**

�� In December 2008 the Government published an action plan outlining its
response to the six themes covered in the Pitt Review into the 2007 flooding and
dedicated £2.15 billion funding to improve flood risk management and resilience
before 2011.

**Increasing domestic capacity to respond to an influenza pandemic**

�� We continued to build the UK’s preparedness for a ’flu pandemic by stockpiling
antivirals, ensuring every NHS Trust and Local Resilience Forum had plans in place
and publishing a suite of additional guidance for responders, businesses and
other organisations.

**Extending networks of organisations engaged in preparing for and**
**responding to domestic emergencies**

�� The Government undertook and extensive consultation on community resilience
which will inform a programme of work to be launched later this year.

�� Publication of the first ever National Risk Register.


###### Future Challenges and the Longer Term Response

**6.72** Whilst it is unlikely that the UK’s risk
profile will change dramatically in the next
20 years, there are obviously factors which
may affect the likelihood of risks occurring,
our vulnerability to them and the potential
impact they may have. Consideration of
the range of possible eventualities can help
us identify and build in the necessary
flexibility in our policy responses. Some of
the potential challenges are outlined
below.

**6.73** As described in Chapter 5, climate
change and the international response, as
well as the UK’s response to it will
undoubtedly have a significant impact on our
resilience over the coming years. In addition
to the primary consequences of severe
weather events, there will also be secondary
impacts such as the potential for migration
and movement of people both within
affected states and to the UK, and for
greater global instability to impact on critical
supplies and supply chains. There is a large


body of work underway to address the
causes of climate change and to adapt to its
consequences. Whilst Government and
emergency responders will remain the first
line of response to events, climate change
will test the resilience of our infrastructure
and communities. All sectors of society –
Government, public bodies, businesses and
individuals – will have a part to play in
preparing ourselves to adapt to those
impacts which are unavoidable.

**6.74** The increasingly networked,
interdependent and complex nature of
modern society, and the critical systems
which underpin daily life will, over the
coming years, increase both the UK’s
vulnerability and the potential impact of
civil emergencies. The interconnectedness
means that a relatively small event, such as
an electricity outage or loss of key
information and communications
networks, irrespective of the cause, can
potentially lead to a cascade failure, with
impacts on a wide range of critical services,
such as water, transport and gas, which


-----

are dependent on that supply. The lack of
inherent resilience in many of our critical
services, for example our reliance on just in
time supply chains, will make us less able
to bounce back from what might
otherwise be minor incidents. Dealing with
these widespread, complex and
unpredictable events will require greater
societal resilience than we have today.

**6.75** The generic way in which the UK
currently prepares for civil emergencies, by
building capabilities to deal with the
consequences of a wide range of events,
provides a flexible and sound basis for
dealing with the changing requirements.
The multi-level, multi sector, bottom-up
approach to resilience planning means
that, wherever and whenever an
emergency occurs, capabilities should be in
place to help respond to and recover from
it. This broad approach is followed
throughout the UK although some aspects
are the responsibility of the Devolved
Administrations. Continued and new
programmes of work to deal specifically
with the highest, potentially catastrophic,
risks (such as pandemic ‘flu), working with
international bodies where necessary, are
obviously also key to improving the UK’s
resilience in the longer term. However,
there are additional measures which might
help us respond to and recover from the
challenges we face.

**6.76** The range of longer-term challenges
outlined here all point to the need to
develop a greater understanding of our
inherent and increasing vulnerabilities and
to build social and economic infrastructure
which is resilient to a wider range of risks.

**6.77** The NRR, which will be reviewed and
reissued later this year, was the first step in
providing advice on how people can better
prepare for civil emergencies should they
wish to do so and incorporated more
established business continuity advice.
Programmes of work to improve corporate


and community resilience, which are
already underway, will build on this and
should, when developed, help build the
sort of socio-economic flexibility and
resilience the UK will need. The new work
by the Government to promote corporate
resilience stemmed originally from the
obligation placed on public sector
organisations both to ensure their own
business continuity in a civil emergency
and, in some cases, to promote business
continuity in the community. There is
evidence that resilience in the private
sector has also improved, but large gaps
remain. It will be in all of our interests, and
it is our collective responsibility, to ensure
that these gaps close as the risk of civil
emergencies grows. A particular focus of
work, which will be developed from the
Pitt Review and the climate change
adaptation programme, will be critical
infrastructure. The Government will publish
a framework and policy statement for an
initial programme to reduce the
vulnerability of critical infrastructure during
the summer of 2009.

**6.78** Similarly, a programme of work will
be announced later this year on
community resilience flowing from the
scoping work undertaken over the last few
months. The scoping work confirms that
the model of community resilience that is
most likely to work is that of self-selecting
communities working together to help
themselves in an emergency, reducing the
burden on the emergency services and
other responder organisations, and
enabling them to focus their efforts on the
most vulnerable groups. But in both cases
the programmes will need to develop and
become embedded in society and with
citizens before they can really have effect.
The Government will announce later this
year how it will contribute to community
resilience schemes, through resources,
guidance, information, and
communication.


-----

**6.79** The delivery mechanisms for civil
emergencies are well established and are
based on the Civil Contingencies Act 2004.
It is founded on the principle of multiagency collaboration at all levels of
Government (local, regional and national)
with Ministerial oversight both of wider
resilience work and specific policy areas.

**6.80** Over the past year, Ministerial
committees have overseen work led by the
Cabinet Office Civil Contingencies
Secretariat to ensure that all Local
Resilience Forums have multi-agency plans
to deal with some of the highest risks such
as flooding and pandemic ‘flu. These plans
knit together the roles and responsibilities
of all agencies and organisations, as well
as the different tiers of Government, which
would be involved in responding to an
incident. The very development of these
plans helps to build trust and familiarity
between organisations, and in the longer
term these plans form the basis for
exercises to ensure each area is as ready as
it can be to face our highest risks. But,
there is always a need to review structures
and consider whether and where changes
might add value. One proposal, emerging
from the Pitt Review, is the concept of a
National Resilience Forum, similar to and
contributing, to the National Security
Forum but focused entirely and therefore
in more depth on resilience related issues.
The Government will establish this Forum
in the second half of 2009.


**6.81** On a more practical level, the types
of challenges we face now and in the
future are likely to require timely and
resilient communications which can target
potentially large sections of the population
at short notice. New communications
technologies need to be explored to
consider whether they can meet this need.
One option which some of our
international partners are pursuing is cell
broadcasting – a system by which people
can be notified of events and provided
with advice in a text message style format
to their mobile phones. The Government
will undertake a review of possible
technologies and work with international
partners to consider whether there is a
system which could support the UK’s
resilience in this way.

#### Chapter 7

### UK National Security Framework – Action in the Threat Domains


**7.1** Having analysed why there are
challenges to the United Kingdom’s
national security interests, and who and
what threatens us as a result, it is
important to look at how and where
those threats manifest themselves in order
to reduce our vulnerability to their impact.
As well as addressing what drives
challenges to national security and what
threats arise as a result, we also look at the
**threat domains.**

**7.2** There are different types of threat
domains:

�� **hostile and destructive capabilities:**
this is a critically important example of
**how threats can arise. A range of threat**
actors, both state and non-state, can
pose national security challenges. In
some areas, the capabilities those with
hostile intent could acquire would, if
used, have consequences of such
severity that the capability itself is an
area of specific risk that requires a
strategic and co-ordinated response.
Nuclear weapons and other weapons of
mass destruction is the most obvious
example;

�� **physical and technological domains:**
there are a number of physical and
technological environments, which can
be characterised as domains where
national security threats can arise. These
include long established and familiar
domains, such as the land and maritime
environments, the air, and emergent,
technology driven domains like space
and cyber space; and


�� **domains of influence: in a globalised,**
information age, there are important
arenas which affect our ability to act
against the drivers of insecurity. A
strengthened international rules-based
system is essential in providing the
robust and effective frameworks
required for an interdependent world.
Without it, risks can arise in various
areas, for example, the use of economic
resources, such as energy supplies, or
unjustified trade restrictions being used
as a hostile policy tool. We also
recognise that almost every element of
national security activity has an
important information dimension, be it
public support for military campaigns,
or persuading those at risk of falling
under the influence of terrorists.

**7.3** There is no simple ‘map’ of how and
where threats can arise. Various groups
that can pose threats to national security
can act in a number of ways and operate
in a number of physical and technological
environments and other domains.

**7.4** This chapter provides a framework for
our strategic response to the questions of
how and where threats can arise, and how
we protect ourselves, in technological
environments such as cyber space or
physical environments such our seas and
borders.


-----

###### Our Borders

The UK already has one of the toughest borders in the world and the UK Border
Agency (UKBA), part of the Home Office, is currently delivering the biggest shake up
of border security and the immigration system in a generation. The new measures
that have been put in place or are in progress will for example, enhance our ability to
prevent entry to those whom we know may pose a threat to our national security,
monitor those who cross our borders, and refer to relevant authorities individuals
who are identified as they are pass through our asylum and migration systems as
potentially posing a national security risk.

In the UKBA we now have a single, strengthened border force that works very
closely with the police. The roll out of the UK’s biometric visa programme was
completed in December 2007 ahead of schedule and under budget. From November
2008, the UKBA began issuing compulsory identity cards to foreign nationals. By
requiring a person to register their unique biometric identifiers we can reduce
immigration abuses, illegal working, the misuse of public funds and identity fraud.

The new electronic eBorders system will enable us to count people in and out of the
country and to conduct checks in real time against crime and terrorism watchlists.
eBorders has already screened over 90 million passengers travelling to the UK, using
data received from approximately 105 carriers on over 185 routes, leading to over
40,000 alerts and more than 3,200 arrests. By the end of 2010 in excess of 95 per cent
of all passenger and crew movements (including UK citizens) into and out of the UK will
be checked.

Between July 2005 and the end of 2008, over 150 people were excluded from the
UK on national security grounds and a further 87 on the basis of unacceptable
behaviour. In addition recent changes to exclusion policy allow for the presumption
in favour of exclusion where an individual comes within the terms of unacceptable
behaviours. Further changes that took effect on 1 June 2009 will enable the Home
Secretary to exclude European Economic Area (EEA) nationals before they travel to
the UK.


###### Hostile and destructive capabilities

**7.5** _Security in an Interdependent World,_
explicitly recognised how a set of hostile
and destructive capabilities, such as nuclear
weapons and others weapons of mass
destruction, could have significant
consequences for our national security.
In Security for the Next Generation we
provide an updated assessment of that
risk.


###### Nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction

**7.6** The Government remains extremely
concerned by the threat posed by the
proliferation of technologies related to
chemical, biological, radiological and
nuclear (CBRN) weapons.

###### Nuclear weapons and other WMD – the past year

**7.7** The Government continues to judge
that no country currently has the capability
and intent to pose a direct threat to the UK
with nuclear, chemical or biological


-----

weapons. However, it would be premature
to conclude that such threats might not
develop in future, either from states or
from terrorist groups, some of whom we
know are trying to develop such
capabilities. As explained in Chapter 6, the
continuing risks from such proliferation
means that the UK’s minimum strategic
deterrent capability, currently represented
by Trident, remains a necessary element of
our security. However, we remain
committed to the goal of a world free of
nuclear weapons and therefore strongly
support the international structures that
are in place to constrain such proliferation
to states or terrorist groups. Although
these have generally been successful in
limiting the global development of such
capabilities, our concerns have been
heightened because:

�� Iran has continued its proliferationsensitive nuclear activities in breach of
numerous UN Security Council
Resolutions and has failed to respond to
International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) questions about possible military
dimensions to its programme. The
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea
(DPRK) has attempted to detonate two
nuclear devices and has launched a
number of ballistic missiles, all in direct
contravention of UN Security Council
Resolutions. Despite repeated attempts
by the international community to
engage, the regime in Pyongyang seems
intent on a policy of isolation and
confrontation. In addition, Syria is not
cooperating fully with IAEA efforts to
investigate suspicious nuclear-related
activity. These states are of particular
concern because of their attitude to
international institutions and treaties,
and for the impact that their activities
have had on regional stability.

�� To enable a shift towards low-carbon
energy generation, while meeting
energy needs, there is likely to be a


global expansion of nuclear power.
Whilst this is welcome, if it is not
managed carefully there is a risk this will
lead to increased availability of dual-use
nuclear technology, knowledge and
nuclear materials relevant to the
manufacture of nuclear weapons.

�� Long term global trends point to an
increase in inter-state tensions, driven by
climate change, competition for
resources, population growth and
movements and increasing public
pressure in less well-developed countries
for improved living conditions.

�� The internet has made information
widely available on the technology of
CBRN devices and the materials which
might be used to develop them. The
advance and spread of dual-use
biotechnology provides easier and
cheaper access to highly destructive and
disruptive technology. This is
increasingly attractive to terrorists.

**7.8** Nationally, therefore, the Government
continues to invest significant resources
into counter-proliferation and CBRN
counter-terrorism efforts. The former is
delivered through a comprehensive
counter-proliferation strategy based
around four inter-linked strands:

�� **Dissuade states from seeking to**
acquire, develop, or spread WMDrelated weapons, materials, technology
and expertise;

�� **Detect attempts by states, and terrorists,**
to develop or acquire these capabilities;

�� **Deny access to WMD and the necessary**
materials, equipment, technology, and
expertise to develop them, while
promoting commerce and technological
development for peaceful purposes; and

�� **Defend our country, our citizens, our**
Armed Forces and our strategic interests
from the threats posed by proliferation.


-----

###### Government progress on commitments in the past year
**Addressing international concerns**
�� As part of the E3+338 in the case of Iran and, in the case of Democratic People’s
Republic Korea (DPRK), as part of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), the
UK continues to put considerable pressure on these two nations to comply with the
will of the international community.

**Strengthening the international nuclear non-proliferation regime**
�� The UK has set a new agenda for non-proliferation, disarmament and arms control,
playing a key role at the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Preparatory Committee
meeting in May. We also played an important role in building consensus at the
Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) on US-India civil nuclear cooperation and in securing
agreement at the Conference on Disarmament to a programme of work that will
include negotiations for a Fissile Materials Cut-Off Treaty (FMCT).

**Reducing the risk of nuclear terrorism**
�� The Government has increased the resources dedicated to tackling CBRN
terrorism threats, and continues to work across government and with partners
internationally to reduce the risk of a successful attack.

**An effective Chemical Weapons Convention**
�� The UK is strongly committed to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
Since the Second Review Conference in April 2008, two States Parties (SPs) have
completely destroyed their declared chemical weapons stockpiles. Good progress
has been made on expanding membership, with Iraq, the Dominican Republic
and the Bahamas acceding to the CWC this year, bringing the number of States
Parties to 188. Only seven countries now remain outside of the Convention.


**7.9** The revised CONTEST strategy
recognises the specific threat of CBRN
terrorism. A recent, classified, strategic
review assessed the current threat facing
the UK and identified specific areas for
further action with regard to countering it.

###### Future Challenges and the Longer Term Response

 Nuclear
**7.10** In his speech on 17 March 2009 on
nuclear non-proliferation and
disarmament, the Prime Minister
underlined that nuclear energy has a vital
role to play in overcoming the global
challenges of climate change, of ensuring
sustainable development and of defeating


poverty. But there is also the risk of a new
and dangerous nuclear era of new states,
and perhaps even non-state nuclear
weapon holders. We will address this risk
by renewing and refreshing the grand
global bargain at the heart of the 2010
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).

**7.11** The Government is determined that
NPT Review Conference will review and
refresh this grand bargain and re-energise
the commitment of the entire international
community to stopping proliferation, to
realising the benefits of peaceful nuclear
energy, and to delivering the NPT’s ultimate
goal of a world free of nuclear weapons.
Because there is a strong inter-linkage
between the global expansion of nuclear


38 The ‘E3+3’ is the group of countries which leads the international community’s engagement with Iran on
nuclear issues. The UK, France and Germany (the E3) initially took forward this engagement. The first meeting
of this group with the US, China and Russia took place in January 2006.


-----

power, the threat posed by nuclear
proliferation and moves towards global
nuclear disarmament, we need a coherent
global strategy to progress on all three
issues.

**7.12** That is why the Prime Minister has
committed to publishing a Road to 2010
plan later this year, setting out proposals in
a range of areas, including:

�� the development of the UK’s civil
nuclear industry;

�� the management of the global
expansion of nuclear power;

�� enhancing the security of fissile
materials;

�� nuclear counter-proliferation;

�� multilateral nuclear disarmament; and

�� reform of the international verification
and control regimes and the
strengthening of the IAEA.

**7.13** Nationally, we have undertaken
a thorough review of our CounterProliferation strategy and its delivery.
We will retain the existing four strands of
that strategy, which are based around
detecting, defending, dissuading and
denying proliferation activities of concern.
Each strand will have a more rigorous
programmatic approach, with clearer
objectives and better assessment of the
effectiveness of delivery. Government
departments will be required to give a
higher priority to counter-proliferation
issues, with stronger inter-Departmental
coordination of bids for additional
resources. The overall strategy will be
governed by a strengthened Cabinet
Office-led Counter Proliferation
Committee, which will, in turn, have a
stronger reporting chain to Ministers.
Closer coherence between the CounterProliferation and Counter-Terrorism
communities will be established, along


with enhanced coordination on intelligence
assessment and operations.

**7.14** We will continue to work hard with
our international partners to achieve
universal application of the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty and the
instruments of the IAEA Safeguards
regime, to secure the entry into force of
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,
including completion of its verification
regime, and to ensure successful
negotiations on a Fissile Material Cut-Off
Treaty.

**7.15** We will continue to take a lead in
designing international mechanisms to
ensure the peaceful uses of nuclear energy,
while mitigating the associated
proliferation risks. We have helped lay the
foundations for such mechanisms through
the conference we co-hosted with the
Netherlands and Germany in 2008, and
the London International Nuclear Fuel
Cycle Conference in March 2009. We will
work to encourage further debate both
regionally and globally.

**7.16** International terrorists have stated
their desire to acquire a CBRN capability.
Such groups have exploited open source
information and have actively recruited
scientists to their cause. There are a
number of facilities in countries across the
world where poor security could provide a
route for terrorists to procure nuclear
materials. As part of our response, the UK
will ratify the Amendment to the
Convention for the Physical Protection of
Nuclear Material (CPPNM) and press key
countries that have not yet ratified this
amendment to do so as soon as possible.

###### Chemical and Biological Weapons
**7.17** Although less than a dozen states
have offensive chemical or biological (CB)
programmes, the number of countries that
have the potential capability to produce CB
weapons is large. Regional security issues


-----

including competition for natural resources
and energy, may provide the political
drivers for some countries to consider
acquiring them. Access to knowledge
about former state CB programmes, as
well as the growth and global spread of
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical
industries may provide technology drivers.

**7.18** We believe that international
co-operation in the framework of the
Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)
and the Biological and Toxin Weapons
Convention (BTWC) is key to defeating
the threat from chemical and biological
weapons, and we are committed to
strengthening these agreements.

**7.19** The BTWC Review Conference in
2010 is advancing work to strengthen the
Convention and promote its universality.
In between review conferences the UK
actively participates in inter-sessional
meetings held to discuss agreed topics
such as national implementation, biosafety
and biosecurity, awareness-raising and
codes of conduct, capacity building and
assistance in cases of alleged use of
biological or toxin weapons.

**7.20** The CWC Review Conference in
2008 reaffirmed the comprehensive nature
of the prohibition of chemical weapons,
the need to take into account scientific
and technological change to keep the
verification regime effective and the
importance of full and effective national
implementation of all obligations under the
Convention. The conference also noted the
threat from non-state actors including
terrorists and encourages states who are
party to the convention to consult and
cooperate on ways to prevent terrorists
from acquiring and/or using chemical
weapons. The UK is supporting efforts to
encourage states not party to the CWC to
accede as soon as possible. Iraq recently
acceded to the CWC and the UK is


considering possible post-accession
assistance.

###### Conventional Weapons
**7.21** The proliferation of conventional
weapons remains a significant concern
because of links to regional stability and
global economic factors, as well as
humanitarian issues. The UK is strongly
supporting the UN process towards an Arms
Trade Treaty to regulate the international
trade in arms. The UK led international
efforts to secure a new international
agreement to ban the use, production,
transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions,
and signed the Convention on Cluster
Munitions in December 2008. The UK
remains committed to the global
humanitarian effort to rid the world of these
munitions. In the same way, we are willing to
extend export laws to control extra-territorial
brokering and trafficking of small arms, and
potentially other weapons.

**7.22** We will ensure that our work under
CONTEST on reducing the threat from
international terrorism and our work under
the Government’s counter-proliferation
strategy on improving the security of all
WMD materials are brought together in a
way that ensures a comprehensive
approach to reducing the CBRN security
threat to the UK and its overseas interests.

###### Physical and technological domains

**7.23** We recognise the importance of
particular physical and technological
environments as domains of threat where
national security risks can arise. These
include long-established and familiar
domains, such as the land and maritime
environments in which the UK has operated
for hundreds of years. They also include the
air, which has become increasingly
prominent since the advent of powered
flight in the early twentieth century, and
emergent domains that are being rapidly


-----

shaped and re-shaped by changes in
technology and patterns of utilisation, such
as space and cyber space.

**7.24** In some cases, the national security
challenges in a given domain are already
being tackled under the remit of a
particular threat. For example, the
CONTEST strategy addresses the terrorist
threat in the air and land environments. In
other cases, such as cyber, maritime and
space, a combination of the diversity of the
challenges and the existing configuration
of the delivery architecture argues for
co-ordination, on the basis of the domain,
as the best means of providing coherence.

**7.25** Whilst all of these domains are
inherently trans-national in character, the
emergent domains are less dependent on
physical location and, as such, distance is a
less effective buffer against potential
threats.

**7.26** Addressing threats in these domains
has substantial common requirements: for
coherent strategic direction, for effective
information-sharing and situational
awareness, for co-ordinated incident
response, and for effective use of resources.

**7.27** The UK’s national security framework
looks across the full range of physical and
technological domains. Within the physical
environment, considerable attention is now
being paid to the maritime domain,
reflecting the UK’s long-established key
strategic interests, our history as a
maritime nation, and recent emerging
challenges. In the technological domain,
the need for security in cyber space is now
a pressing concern. And assets in space are
also increasingly important to the modern
way of life. These are therefore three of
the current areas of focus for specific
consideration within the national security
framework.


###### Maritime Security

**7.28** The maritime domain stretches
beyond the UK’s territorial waters, and
comprises all of our interests overseas.
Global shipping, for example, is
a cornerstone of international trade.

**7.29** It follows that maritime security
comprises a very wide range of issues,
interests and activities, many of which
relate to the operation of threats and
drivers across the marine and in the littoral
environments. The maritime domain
remains a conduit for threats but also
offers a range of opportunities for the UK’s
national security. The diagram overleaf
provides an illustration of the ways in
which interconnected threats and drivers
can manifest in the maritime domain.

**7.30** The UK is, and has ever been, a
distinctively maritime nation. The UK has
over 10,500 miles of coastline and 600
ports. There are 14 Overseas Territories, and
some 5.5 million UK citizens living overseas.
Over 90 per cent of UK trade by volume
(686 million tonnes) transits by sea.
Maritime transport remains critical for
energy supplies to the UK. Historically, we
have relied upon the ability to protect the
integrity of our maritime borders, be it
against invasion during time of conflict,
against criminality in the form of
smuggling, or as a source of natural
resource. Maritime capability has also
historically been central to ensuring security
of trade routes and access to markets.

**7.31** Over the last few months, the
terrorist attacks in Mumbai and the
increase in piracy related incidents
particularly in the Horn of Africa, have
increased international focus on the
challenges this poses both for the maritime
sector and more broadly for international
security.

###### Piracy off the Horn of Africa

The past year has seen a surge in piracy in the seas off the Horn of Africa. Ships
ranging from small privately owned yachts to very large oil tankers have been
targeted by small groups of pirates equipped with guns and rocket-propelled
grenades. Around 22000 ships passed through the Gulf of Aden in 2008, so piracy
threatens one of the world’s trade arteries. Piracy not only poses a direct threat to
UK economic interests, but also to UK tourists and merchant crew.

Piracy stems from serious instability within Somalia, exacerbated by the lack of
capacity for regional response. Any long term solution must take account of the
many complex issues involved, including the need to support improvements in
governance and the rule of law.

The international response to piracy has been effective in reducing risks to shipping,
and includes contributions from China, Russia, Japan and India, as well as many
NATO and EU nations. Over 30 pirate vessels have been destroyed or confiscated
and over 130 pirate suspects transferred for prosecution over the past year.

Under UK leadership, the EU launched a major operation, called ATALANTA. This
operation aims to: protect World Food Programme ships delivering food aid to
Somalia; protect vulnerable shipping transiting the region; and deter, prevent and
repress acts of piracy off the Somali coast.

Since this operation was launched last year, supplies into Somalia have continued
unchecked and far fewer attempted acts of piracy have been successful. NATO and
the US-led Combined Maritime Forces have also made a significant contribution to
international efforts to tackle piracy and are working closely with ATALANTA.

The UK is also playing a leading role in the International Contact Group on Piracy off
the Coast of Somalia. This has included working with maritime industry to ensure
that best practice for ships transiting the region is effectively disseminated, working
with the military operations to ensure co-ordination, and starting work on capability
building in the region.

A long term sustainable solution will require concerted activity on many fronts. In the
meantime the effort to deter and disrupt pirate activity will need to be increased. We
will continue to work closely with the shipping industry to make it harder for pirates
to attack or gain control of ships, and we encourage and support more countries to
prosecute and jail pirates detained by international forces.

**7.32** The UK has many assets it can bring
to bear to both address threats and exploit
opportunities in the maritime domain. But
some areas of policy have developed
independently over the years as threats
and related technology have evolved.
Given the ongoing importance of this
domain to the UK, and the increasing
interdependence of the threats and drivers,
it is vital that we take a more
comprehensive overview of maritime
security.

**7.33** To address the range of challenges in
the maritime domain, the Cabinet Office is
leading a cross-government study that will
bring together key elements of
government and industry in a partnership
approach and across the full range of

maritime security challenges. This work will
clarify which elements pose the greatest
challenges and which present the most
opportunities for our national security. It
will prioritise our aims, assess our current
capabilities and identify ways to fill any key
gaps and remove duplication. We will work
with international partners where
appropriate. A report with
recommendations for further action will be
completed over the next twelve months,
following consultation with the National
Security Forum and others experts.

**7.34** More specifically, in addressing the
threat from piracy off the Horn of Africa, we
will step up efforts to train and equip coast
guard, fishery protection and naval forces in
the area so that progressively they can

complement and in due course replace the
international maritime effort. And in the
longer term, we will need to develop
sustainable Somali-based solutions to this
problem, including supporting alternate
livelihoods for littoral populations,
enhancing the ability of the Somali
authorities to impose the rule of the law,
and more generally working with the
political authorities in that country to ensure
that the ungoverned space cannot be used
by those who might post a threat to our
national security.

###### Cyber Security

**7.35** Millions of people across the UK now
rely on the services and information that
make up cyber space. It is often an essential
component of many people’s jobs, and
many people rely on cyber space for
commerce, research, and social activities.
Modern business, Government, and critical
national infrastructure are similarly
dependent on this new domain of human
activity. Cyber space presents major
opportunities for citizens, business and
Government alike and its effective
functioning is of vital importance.


Cyber space encompasses all forms of
networked, digital activities; this
includes the content and actions
conducted through digital networks.


**7.36** The increasingly digital nature of our
society is recognised in the Government’s
Digital Britain strategy, which aims to make
the United Kingdom the leading major
economy for innovation, investment and
quality in the digital and communications
industries. Digital Britain will bring forward
a unified framework to help maximise the
UK’s competitive advantage and the
benefits to society. The Government’s
ultimate goal is to reduce the risks from
the UK’s use of cyber space to ensure we
can reap its full benefits for the UK,


including using it to assist in the pursuit of
our broader security policy goals. The
Government recognises that we need to
secure the broader benefits of this
engagement with the digital world: for the
individual citizen, for business, and for the
public sector.

**7.37** With the increasing importance of
cyber space, however, comes greater
exposure and vulnerability to some of the
national security threats that interact with,
and through, it. The asymmetric, low cost,
and largely anonymous, nature of cyber
space makes it an attractive domain for use
by organised criminals, terrorists and in
conventional state-led espionage and
warfare. Those with hostile intent can, for
whatever reason, use a variety of methods
of attack through networks, radio
communications, supply chains and
potentially high power radio frequency
transmissions, to gather intelligence,
spread false information, interfere with
data or disrupt the availability of a vital
system.

**7.38** These same attributes also potentially
make cyber space a useful domain for the
UK to exploit in fighting crime and
terrorism, as well as in the military sphere.

**7.39** As with all national security threats,
we must be realistic about the risks, and
proportionate in our response. We all have
an important contribution to make to
ensuring that we reduce those risks to the
greatest extent possible, maximise the
benefits, and do so in a way that
safeguards the respect for privacy and civil
liberties that is enshrined in the values of
the UK. Government and business must
work together to provide more secure
products and services, to operate their
information systems safely and to protect
individuals’ privacy. And citizens have a
responsibility to take simple security
measures to protect themselves, their
families, and others in society.


-----

**7.40** That is why, alongside Security for
_the Next Generation, the Government is_
launching the first Cyber Security
**Strategy of the UK. The Strategy**
recognises the challenges of cyber security
and the need to address them. It sets out
the UK’s strategic objectives of reducing
risk and exploiting opportunities by
improving knowledge, capabilities and
decision-making in order to secure the UK’s
overall advantage in cyber space.

**7.41** The Cyber Security Strategy aims to
build on existing work across government
and industry by developing a more
cohesive and coherent framework. As a
result of the Strategy, the Government is
therefore announcing a crossgovernmental programme of key cyber
security work, and establishing an Office
of Cyber Security to lead it.


identified as gaps in national capability that
warrant early prioritisation.

**7.43** The Government is also establishing
an operational centre for monitoring the
health of cyber space, and for response to
cyber security incidents. This centre will not
only improve the information already
provided to industry, organisations and the
public – it will also work with the Office of
Cyber Security to systematically identify
and prioritise new areas of work for
targeted investment as the crossgovernment cyber security programme
evolves.


**7.44** In summary, the Government will:

�� establish a cross-government
programme to address priority areas in
pursuit of the UK’s strategic cyber
security objectives, including:


– providing additional funding for the
development of innovative future
technologies to protect UK networks;


– developing and promoting the
growth of critical skills;

�� work closely with the wider public
sector, industry, civil liberties groups, the
public and with international partners;


**va**

**7.42** In addition to bringing together
existing work across Government to make
best use of the substantial resources that
have already been committed to cyber
security, the Government will be providing
an initial injection of new funding to
support and expand the collaborative work
already being undertaken by the
Government and industry to help protect
UK networks. This additional funding will
target those areas that the Strategy has


�� set up an Office of Cyber Security (OCS)
to provide strategic leadership for and
coherence across Government;

�� create a Cyber Security Operations
Centre (CSOC) to:


– actively monitor the health of cyber
space and co-ordinate incident
response;

– enable better understanding of
attacks against UK networks and
users;


– provide better advice and
information about the risks to
business and the public.


-----

Further detail, on these steps and others, is
included in the accompanying Cyber
Security Strategy (Cm 7642).

###### Space

**7.45** Just as cyber space underpins many
elements of our daily life, space also plays
an increasingly key role in modern society,
although the dependence of many or our
networks on resources such as satellites in
space is less generally recognised. For
instance, while navigation is the most
recognisable product of the Global
Positioning Satellite (GPS) array, (road
haulage companies, shipping and aircraft
rely heavily on GPS), it also facilitates a
highly accurate and stable timing signal to
many systems globally, including resource
networks. The transmitted ‘pulse’ also
controls the regularity of the frequency
within the UK’s 50 Hertz electricity supply,
the universally-accepted time-stamp
required in our global financial
transactions, mobile phone coverage and
the synchronisation of radios used by
security services such as the police.

**7.46** This considerable and increasing
dependence on space makes us vulnerable
to any disruption but also presents
opportunities which the UK can use to its
advantage. The UK need to understand
where and how it may be vulnerable and
what the impacts of this might be – then
ensure we protect against them and
prepare for them. We also needs to think
strategically about how space can be used
to support security and other aims and
work to shape our approach and the
infrastructure and technology we need to
achieve it.

**7.47** Given the UK’s current reliance on
foreign-owned space assets this may
require some fundamental and difficult
decisions both for Government and
industry. It will also require close working


with international partners who are facing
similar questions.


**7.48** In many ways, the challenges and
opportunities the UK faces in space are
similar to those we are addressing in cyber
security, and there is much we can learn
from that process.

**7.49** The Government will now undertake
a review of the strategic security of the
UK’s interests in space, working with key
stakeholders across Government, in
industry and internationally. It will consider
the UK’s strategic approach to space, how
it underpins our security objectives and
provide recommendations on how this
should be developed to secure our interests
now and in the future. The review will be
led by the Cabinet Office and will seek the
advice of the National Security Forum.

###### Domains of influence

**7.50** In addition to the long-established
and clearly understood physical domains,
and newer technological ones, the
National Security Strategy also focuses on
areas of human activity which are of
fundamental importance to global stability.
The first is around public opinion, culture
and information – in short, the debates


###### Galileo

For some time, the UK has been
working with our European partners
in the development of Galileo, a
Global Navigational Satellite System
(GNSS), which has been developed
with civil applications in mind. On
completion in 2013 it will give Europe
an independent GNSS capability and
not only provide a boost to the
European space industrial sector and
build up expertise and know-how in a
developing area but also help deliver a
wide range of UK and Community
policies.


-----

around the globe that affect the attitudes
of people and what drives the behaviour of
individuals, groups, and nations. The
second is around the vital area of
international organisation and how
multilateral structures are configured to
facilitate shared solutions to shared
problems in the global age.

###### Public Opinion, culture and information

**7.51** This domain of activity is increasingly
important for national security. We live in
an information age. The world is
increasingly connected and transparent.
More than ever before the actions of
government are subject to scrutiny and
comment, at home and overseas.

**7.52** Almost every domain of national
security activity has an important
information dimension. Military campaigns
must command the support of public
opinion, and secure the support of the
people amongst whom they are carried
out. Indeed some have argued that for
much military activity, the very purpose is
to win the support of the people
concerned rather than some more
traditional physical objective. Diplomatic
activity is as much about engagement with
non-governmental organisations as about
traditional inter-state diplomacy.
Intelligence and other covert activity will
necessarily remain secret in detail, but
must command legitimacy and support
through a degree of openness and
understanding in the aggregate.

**7.53** In countering terrorism, we have put
increased effort into preventing people
from becoming terrorists or supporting
violent extremism, as the strategic solution
to the problem of terrorism. This seeks to
challenge Al Qa’ida’s ideology, which is
based on a distorted interpretation of
Islam, exposing its inaccuracies and
shortcomings through better information,


challenge and debate, as well as
addressing perceived grievances that can
colour individuals views of western society.
This is essential: Al Qaida are very
conscious of the importance of
propaganda for radicalisation, and have
made good use of the internet for this
purpose. In our own communications we
recognise the need to engage with the
public on the counter-terrorism agenda;
publishing the full CONTEST strategy this
year was a key step in this direction.

**7.54** So the domain of public opinion, of
culture, and of information and influence,
is a vital area to be considered in its own
right. The exponential growth of the
Internet and cyber space has expanded the
range and influence of this domain so that
it is both global (because the internet can
connect almost all nations, communities
and individuals across the globe) and very
localised (because people can choose
through cyber space who they wish to
connect to). These ‘local’ communities are
not necessarily geographical, because
people can choose to align to communities
across the world.

**7.55** Gaining the support of people
around the world for our values, for our
vision of a secure, stable, just and
prosperous world based on cooperation
between peoples and nations, and for the
actions we take in support of that vision, is
a vital part of securing our future. These
are powerful, universal values, irrespective
of race or religion. We must continue to
develop our capacity to express and
communicate the values that inform our
policy. If we believe in these values, as we
do, we should be confident in our ability to
express and communicate them, and
thereby to win support for them. We must
therefore aspire to be effective in this
domain, organising all our resources to the
best effect.


-----

**7.56** The Government has already
recognised the importance of this sphere
for national security activity, and, just as
importantly, for wider community
cohesion. For example, the FCO works to
address some commonly held
misperceptions about our foreign policy
and about life in the UK for British
Muslims: misperceptions which are
exploited by violent extremists to discredit
our values and win support for their cause.
We have recognised the importance of
supplementing traditional government
communications with more proactive
face-to-face and online contacts to ensure
that people develop an accurate picture of
our work. Since some communities and
individuals can be suspicious of
governments as a source of information,
we are finding credible voices within
communities and building larger contact
bases to enable us to quickly and
effectively distribute the facts about our
policies and rebut distortions.

**7.57** To help tackle the threat from
international terrorism, the Home Office,
the Department for Communities and
Local Government, and the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office, established in
2007 a joint Research, Information and
Communications Unit (RICU) which advises
on, coordinates, and helps deliver the
Government’s counter terrorism
communications.


###### Internationalism: Global responses to global problems

**7.58** In an increasingly globalised world,
the UK’s security and prosperity are
dependent on international stability. The
best way to achieve this is through a
robust rules-based international
**system. Cutting across all aspects of the**
Government’s Strategic Framework for
National Security is the firm commitment
to working in partnership with other
countries and multilateral institutions.

**7.59** Just as our approach to activity in the
UK is governed by our commitment to the
rule of law and accountable government,
so our activity in the international
environment is governed by our
commitment to internationalism and
working with others to develop global
responses to global problems, with
effective global capability to implement
them. This means pushing for clearly
articulated principles and a robust
framework of rules for international activity
– whether it is military, commercial, or
other examples – upheld and enforced by
effective, responsible and accountable
institutions.

**7.60** This is a vital principle. The response
to global challenges must be
internationalist not isolationist: one country
may be tempted to take damaging action
in its own interests. This action in itself may
only have limited impact but it might then


###### London Summit

Against the backdrop of the worst international banking crisis in generations, the
London Summit in April 2009 brought together leaders of the world’s major and
emerging economies, as well as key international institutions. As Chair, the UK took
a leading role in forging agreement on the appropriate response to these challenges
and to ensure multilateral commitment to taking the necessary action to stabilise
financial markets and enable families and businesses to get through the recession; to
reform and strengthen the global financial and economic system to restore
confidence; and to put the global economy on track for sustainable growth. We will
continue to lead this agenda through our G20 Presidency in 2009.


-----

provoke a similar response by other states.
Collectively, this damages global stability.
In the economic context, this risk can be
seen in the current economic slowdown
with the temptation to impose restrictive
trade measures for the benefit of a
particular country. More generally, it can be
seen in the potential for states to use
energy supplies or other economic levers
as hostile policy tools. Strong international
frameworks are needed to combat these
risks. This is why multilateralism is at the
heart of the National Security Strategy.

###### The past year

**7.61** **Global economic cooperation has**
been at the forefront of the multilateral
agenda over the past year. Security in an
_interdependent world outlined the very_
significant priority the Government gives to
promoting strong international financial
institutions (IFIs) and the need for further,
wide-ranging reform to reflect better the
composition of the twenty first century
economy.

**7.62** The financial crisis and subsequent
synchronised global economic downturn
has generated much greater impetus and
global support for this agenda. The London
Summit, under UK Chairmanship, in April
brought together leaders of the world’s
major and emerging economies covering
85 per cent of the world’s output, as well
as key international institutions.

**7.63** The London Summit outcomes
included:

�� A commitment to a package of
measures to help the world economy
through the crisis;

�� Agreement to take steps to prevent
future crises building by creating the
Financial Stability Board to develop
greater cross-border regulation and
crisis management;


�� Agreement to reform the mandates,
scope and governance of the IFIs to
reflect changes in the world economy
and the new challenges of globalisation,
including giving greater representation
to emerging and developing countries,
including the poorest;

�� Extended commitment not to raise trade
barriers or impose any new export trade
restrictions until the end of 2010;

�� Tasking the WTO and other
international organisations such as the
OECD to monitor and report publicly on
adherence to anti-protectionism;

�� Taking steps to eliminate tax havens and
non-cooperative tax jurisdictions;

�� Agreement to make an additional $850
billion available through international
institutions (including £750 billion for
the IMF), promoting global liquidity and
supporting countries most in need
during the crisis;

�� Tasking the International Labour
Organisation with monitoring the
actions countries are taking and should
take to support employment and
provide social protection during the
crisis;

�� Commitment of $50 billion to support
social protection, boost trade and
safeguard development in the poorest
countries, and reaffirmed commitment
to aid targets and to the MDGs; and

�� Commitment to make the best possible
use of investment funded by fiscal
stimulus programmes based on
understanding the importance of
transition towards clean, innovative,
resource efficient, low carbon
technologies and infrastructure.

**7.64** In international **security, building**
stability, democratic governance and
prosperity in Afghanistan and Pakistan,


-----

as well as countering terrorism and violent
extremism remain challenges for us and our
partners in the UN, NATO and elsewhere.
With international partners, we are working
to tackle the continuing humanitarian crisis
in Somalia as well as the piracy, crime and
extremism which are fuelled by it. Following
the Georgia-Russia conflict in August 2008,
we are working with both parties and with
international partners to ensure greater
stability in that region – through the
presence of the EU, the Organisation for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
and the UN – the resettlement of civilians
and a long-term political process. With
international partners we are also working
with the Georgian government to support
democratic reform and closer Euro-Atlantic
integration.

**7.65** The UK is active across a broad range
of multilateral organisations aimed at
strengthening global security.

Within NATO:

�� The UK takes a leading role in NATO,
especially in the areas of transformation
and capability development. The NATO
Defence Ministers’ meeting in London
last September gave impetus to the
transformation agenda and led to an
increase in deployability targets for
Allies’ land forces from 40 per cent to
50 per cent. The NATO Summit agreed
a Declaration on Alliance Security, which
sets the rationale for NATO’s future
direction and underlines the need to
make capabilities more flexible and
deployable to respond quickly to new
crises.

�� NATO has benefited from expansion
and in the past year has welcomed
Albania and Croatia as members. The
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
will be invited to join soon and Georgia
and Ukraine are in the process of
agreeing Annual National Programmes


with the Alliance to help them
implement the reforms necessary for
eventual membership. France’s
reintegration into NATO’s military
structure has given further impetus to
NATO transformation and a key priority
of our engagement with both NATO
and the EU is to increase the European
contribution to global security activity.

Within the United Nations:

�� The United Nations (UN) remains a
vital part of the UK’s multilateral effort.
We have directly supported, through
the Conflict Prevention Pool, the
building of UN Headquarters capacity in
projects which cover the spectrum of
the conflict cycle. The UK has also
provided police and civilian
secondments to key international
institutions including the UN, EU and
OSCE in 2008/9 and has shaped
ongoing debate on the development
of EU mediation capacity. There has
been continued UK political support for
the UN Mediation Support Unit.

�� In January 2009, the UK and France
launched an initiative in the Security
Council to address the need for more
effective UN peacekeeping. This will
help to ensure that peacekeeping
operations have clearer, tighter and
more realistic mandates and that
progress can be measured.

�� The UK is already working to
incorporate best practice into the every
day work of the Security Council, such
as introducing benchmarks into
peacekeeping mandates, in order to
enable more effective progress
monitoring; ensuring that mandates
better incorporate conflict analysis and
military advice; and provide for better
consultation of troop and police
contributors to peacekeeping
operations. We are also working to


-----

ensure closer linkages between
peacekeeping and peacebuilding to
strengthen the international response
when countries emerge from conflict.

�� In June 2009, the UN Secretary-General
will issue his report on peace building.
We will ensure rapid progress to
implement its recommendations
including through our support to
strengthen UN leadership, to clarify the
division of labour for post-conflict
recovery within the UN, and between
the UN and the World Bank, and to
make the Peacebuilding Commission
and Fund more effective. We are
working with others to improve
international civilian capacity and
strengthen links with bilateral capacity.
We are supporting strengthened UN
leadership on the ground.

Within the European Union:

�� The reaffirmation of the EU European
Security Strategy (ESS) in December
2008 was an important step in
achieving more robust, accountable and
integrated EU security policy. We remain
committed to the EU’s European
Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) and
to an integrated approach to addressing
crises, including close coordination
between military and civilian activity.
During the French Presidency of the EU
in the latter half of 2008, a Crisis
Management Planning Directorate was
introduced with the UK’s full support.
This set up permanent comprehensive
political and strategic planning
capability with civilian and military
strategic planners working together.

Working with the African Union:

�� In April 2008 the Prime Minister
underlined the need for more
sustainable funding for African Union
(AU) peacekeeping at the UN Security


Council. We will continue to pursue this
agenda with international partners.

�� The AU continues to develop its African
Peace and Security Architecture, as well
as maintaining peacekeeping missions
in the field in Darfur and Somalia, to
which the UK has made significant
contributions.

�� The UK, with the EU and other
international partners, has contributed
to supporting the growing network of
Political Offices in Africa which provide
information and advice to policy makers
in Addis Ababa. The EU has also
continued to support the development
of the AU Continental Early Warning
System (CEWS). The next twelve months
will be important for the development
of the Africa Stand-by Force (ASF), and
the UK and EU are supporting the
process of creating its operational
capability.

**7.66** The stability and governance of the
international rules based system is critical
for our ongoing security and prosperity.
However, we also maintain important
**bilateral relationships within the global**
context which remain critical. Over the past
year we have worked to develop strong
ties with the new Administration in the
**United States, our most important**
bilateral partner. We have continued to
build an effective and close bilateral
relationship with China, and recently
launched our first ever public strategy,
_The UK and China: A Framework for_
_Engagement, which makes clear that_
building a progressive partnership with
China is a long-term UK priority. The UK’s
relations with Russia, culturally and
economically, are strong and Russia
continues to play a constructive role
internationally, though we stand firm
where we consider actions to be
unacceptable, such as over Georgia. The
UK developed and deepened co-operation


-----

with India across a broad range of bilateral
issues including political, development,
culture and education. The UK is also
committed to its long-term strategic
relationship with Pakistan and will
continue to strengthen it through highlevel dialogue and close co-ordination to
help the country build stronger security
capability, better governance and sustained
economic development.

###### Future priorities

**7.67** Building on these successes, our
future priorities for strengthening
multilateral capability to tackle global
challenges include:

�� **the global economy: we will work to**
ensure that the consensus achieved by
the G20 to overcome the economic
crisis continues and that the London
Summit commitments are upheld and
built upon. We will also seek to make
progress on long-term issues such as
climate change and international
development. The sustainable
enlargement and reform of international
financial institutions to reflect better the
modern world is a priority, and we will
continue efforts to develop a suitable
new model for multilateralism;

�� **NATO: we are committed to developing**
the new NATO strategic concept and
will continue to support an open door
policy on enlargement, working with
countries aspiring to join the Alliance to
implement necessary reforms. We will
continue to contribute to NATO’s ISAF
force in creating a stable and
sustainable future in Afghanistan;

�� **the United Nations: we will champion**
reform of the UNSC throughout
negotiations in Autumn 2009 and will
encourage more of the dialogue
between member states that has helped
to generate a more proactive and
constructive approach to the debate.


�� **non-proliferation: as part of the**
Government’s approach to countering
nuclear proliferation, we are committed
to strengthening the IAEA so that it can
successfully fulfil its crucial role in
safeguarding against the spread of
nuclear weapons and will set out
proposals for doing so in the run up to
the 2010 Review Conference of the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty;

�� **conflict and instability: we will chair a**
meeting of the UNSC in August 2009 to
set out progress on UN peacekeeping
operations and to set the context for
further work. We will continue to work
towards a resolution to the three critical
challenges facing the UN peacebuilding:
ensuring stronger leadership around a
single strategy; deploying civilian experts
to support national efforts; and
disbursing fast flexible financing to get
recovery going. Building further capacity
in regional security institutions remains
a priority, in particular, we are ready to
offer support for the restructuring and
strengthening the AU Commission’s
Peace and Security Department.

**7.68** The UK has played a major role in a
series of significant achievements which
have reformed and strengthened the
international institutions that sustain the
rules-based system.

**7.69** The Government is committed to
pushing further still to ensure that
international governance across all
domains of activity is robust and able to
respond effectively to the challenges of the
global era and that the commitments
made this year are upheld.

#### Chapter 8

### Conclusion

**8.1** This update of the National Security
Strategy – Security for the next generation
– sets out the Government’s assessment of
the range of national security challenges
we face across a broad range of drivers,
threats and domains of activity.

**8.2** National security challenges arise in
different ways, and within different
timeframes. Some, like international
terrorism or poverty, are already evident
and require a continuing response. The
most significant implications of other
challenges, such as climate change, are
unlikely to be seen within the next twenty
years but require action now to mitigate
the consequences. In the case of other
potential threats, like pandemic ‘flu, there
is no credible scientific way of predicting
exactly when threats may arise and we
therefore require a constant state of
readiness to respond.

**8.3** The Government will continue to look
objectively at the evidence to assess how
challenges to national security develop,
and over what timescale. This strategy, and
future updates, therefore set the
framework for targeting the resources
allocated specifically to national security
activity in the 2007 Comprehensive
Spending Review and in future spending
reviews.

**8.4** The National Security, International
Relations and Development Committee
(NSID), chaired by the Prime Minister, is the
Cabinet Committee charged with oversight
of the National Security Strategy. NSID


brings together the large group of
Ministers, heads of Agencies and other key
parts of the national security apparatus
within Government within one forum for
consideration of strategic national security
issues. Over the next year NSID will review
progress against delivering the
commitments set out in the National
Security Strategy, and assess ongoing
developments and the Government’s
response. NSID is supported by a dedicated
National Security Secretariat in the Cabinet
Office, which brings together a wide range
of national security related work across
Government. The Secretariat will also lead
the development of further important
work on maritime security, security of
strategic interests in space, and other key
studies, working closely with other
departments, partners and the private
sector. The Government will continue to
develop its horizon scanning capabilities,
building on the successful establishment of
the Strategic Horizons Unit last year.

**8.5** We will continue to seek the fullest
possible range of external advice. The
National Security Forum will continue to
advise NSID on national security issues and
will be specifically consulted on key
forthcoming work on maritime security.
The Government looks forward to working
with the new Joint Parliamentary
Committee on the National Security
Strategy. We will continue to develop links
with academia and research organisations
with an interest in national security.

**8.6** The aim of the National Security
Strategy Strategic Framework is to ensure
that Government thinking on national
security keeps pace with a rapidly evolving
global context. As such we will publish
further regular assessments on the
challenges we face, and on progress in
implementing this strategy. This will allow
Parliament and the wider public to
scrutinise the Government’s national
security activity and our assessment of
security risks.

**8.7** By bringing together the full range of
national security challenges and activities
in a single strategic framework that looks
ahead to the long term, the Government
aims to provide the UK with a coherant set


of objectives and plans for national security
activity. The Framework is designed to
address the specific challenges arising from
our analysis of the position of the UK in
the modern world. Delivering our plans
requires a concerted and co-ordinated
effort within Government. It also requires
strong and enduring partnerships with
business, local communities, and
international partners. And our approach
to national security must be proportionate
and consistent with the cherished values of
liberty in a free society governed by the
rule of law. All of this is essential if we are
to deliver the progress we need in moving
towards a more secure, stable, just and
prosperous world.
