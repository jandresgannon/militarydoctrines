# National Defence Strategy Of The Czech Republic

I. INTRODUCTION
Defence of the state is the matter of the whole society and each citizen. Its main objective is to ensure the basic conditions for security and prosperity of the society and its members. The most important conditions are sovereignty, territorial integrity, democratic system and national independence.

These conditions can be ensured only by the society and citizens that care for the defenceability of their country. Therefore, the questions of defence are the state priority. The above-mentioned conception of the state defence follows from the conviction that the society which does not defend its own country resigns the possibility to intervene in the crisis situations and armed conflicts which directly or indirectly endanger its interests.

The national defence strategy makes a conception base for the development of a complex system of defence of the Czech Republic and for its military strategy. An objective of the national defence strategy is to set the principles for a spirited and resolute activity directed to ensuring the security of the state, averting an armed conflict and to the use of its armed forces in the case when the above-mentioned values are endangered by external or internal factors. As far as the quality, the national defence strategy is superdepartmental because it is related with the whole area of preparation of the state for economical mobilisation, preparation of the state territory, infrastructure and the whole potential of the resources and means which should be at disposal for the defence. All the constitutional bodies of the state, state administration bodies, territorial administrations, legal entities and citizens participate in the implementation of the national defence strategy within their responsibility. Ensuring of the conditions for their activity in the sense of the defence strategy will require legal arrangements.

## Ii. Bases Of National Defence Strategy 1. Geopolitical Position And Risks Of Threat To The Czech Republic

Demographic, geographical and geopolitical parameters and economical potential rank the Czech Republic among the countries the international an political position of which is determined namely by their economical, social and political stability, democratic system, active involvement in the international economical relations, quality of their home and foreign policy and credible demonstration of ability and determination to defend themselves with the support of the bonds of alliance in the area of security.

Security of the Czech Republic is influenced primarily by the international political and military political situation in Europe as well as in the world. Probability of a global conflict has been substantially diminished during the last years. The Czech Republic is not threatened with an open armed aggression at present. However, a break out of conflicts having limited objectives and local sphere of activity cannot be excluded in the eastern and south-eastern areas adjacent to Central Europe as a result of historical problems in territorial, ethnic or religious context. Further stabilisation in Europe is connected with the success of the European integration process and relations between the major world powers.

Security environment of the Czech Republic is characterised by a growth of new external and internal risks of not only military but, first of all, non-military and mixed character. These risks prove to be important namely because they are difficult to be foreseen.

## 2. Interests And Policy Of The Czech Republic In The Area Of Defence

The Czech Republic is interested in a peaceful and free-of-conflict development in Europe and in the world. Such development will strengthen the stability in Europe and will contribute to the development of democratic institutions and economical prosperity of the whole region.

The Czech Republic strives for the maintenance and strengthening of international peace and stability.

In its effort it follows the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and fulfils the obligations following from the international agreements to which it has committed itself. But in case of need it is ready to defend its interests and security in compliance with Article 51 of the UN Charter which words the right of collective and individual self-defence.

An important means for increasing the Czech Republic defenceability is the achievement of full membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) including its integrated structures. Therefore, the Czech Republic will continue its effort to come closer to the NATO member countries in both political and military areas. It understands the membership in NATO as an expression of joint responsibility for the protection and development of democratic values as well as political and economical stability. The Czech Republic will continue at the co-operation with NATO within Partnership for Peace and at the preparation of joint activities directed to both the prevention of conflicts and maintenance of peace in Europe and in the world. In this connection, it attaches great significance also to the co-operation namely with neighbouring states as well as with all the democratic countries.

The Czech Republic will continue taking active part in the international organisations in which the questions of security character are being solved. It considers very important further co-operation with West European Union. The Czech Republic expects that after becoming a member of the WEU it will take part in formulating and implementation of joint foreign and security policy.

A concrete expression of the effort of the Czech Republic for the maintenance of international peace and stability in the world and namely in Europe is its taking part in the peacekceping, observation and other missions of UN, NATO and OSCE.

## Iii. Principles And Main Missions In The Area Of Defence 1. Strategic Principles Of Defence

When asserting its security interests the Czech Republic prefers political means of solution and prevention of threatening conflicts to their solutions by using force. Therefore, a primary objective of the defence strategy is to ensure reliable readiness of the state and its amed forces for defence together with simultaneous diplomatic effort to solve possible conflict by the use of international law and agreements of alliance.

Defence of the state has its political, historical, economical, legal, military, internal security and generally human character with closely connected and mutually intertwined relations. In case of an armed conflict the defence of the state must be comprehensive and integrated and making use of corresponding population, material and financial resources. The comprehensive strategy of defence requires formation of a unified state security system which would directively determine and legislatively exactly assign the responsibility, duties and tasks of the state administration authorities, territorial self-government authorities, legal entities and natural persons in the state of emergency, threat to the state or in the state of war.

An intention of defence is to discourage possible aggressor by the fact that his losses would be substantially higher than possible gained advantages. An objective of defence is to avert an armed conflict; in case of an attack, to repel aggression either by our own forces or using assistance of our allies. If the aggressor penetrates into our state territory, the task of the Army of the Czech Republic (ACR) will be to destroy its forces, to restore the state border and its inviolability and thus even territorial integrity of the Czech Republic.

External security is ensured by the armed forces the readiness of which must, first of all, reliably prove political resolve of the state to self-defence and decision of citizens to defend unconditionally the state interests. Main tool for ensuring the defenceability of the state against outer threat is the ACR.

Internal security and order are ensured by the Ministry of Interior. From the viewpoint of defence strategy, the main mission of the Ministry of Interior (MI) is protection of the state border and elimination of the phenomena which could be a reason for breaking the internal security of the state, its destabilisation or even an armed conflict on its territory.

## 2. Main Missions In The Area Of State Defence

Duties of the state and self-government institutions, social and private organisations and subjects as well as legal entities and natural persons are solved in the whole extent of state defence problem by the laws dealing with the state defence, security of state and its citizens, Army of the Czech Republic, civil protection and the laws and statutes which follow from international agreements. They refer to all the areas of life in connection with the later mentioned main missions at the state defence and other activities which condition the fulfilment of these missions, follow from them or are derived from them.

Both the external and internal security of the state assume a comprehensive defence of its interests.

The main missions in the area of defence differ according to the intensity, character and territorial extent of the situation of crises.

If the character of threat consists in natural disasters, accidents or other danger which, in considerable extent, jeopardise the lives and health of the citizens, their property, or internal security and order, a state of emergency is promulgated. If the sovereignty, territorial integrity and democratic system of the Czech Republic is directly endangered, a state of threat is proclaimed, and, if the Czech Republic is being attacked or if there is a need to fulfil the obligations following from international agreements on joint defence, a state of war is promulgated.

In the state of emergency, state of threat to the country and state of war, in compliance with corresponding laws, the state institutions gain special competence, and our citizens as well as aliens dwelling on the territory of the state are required to obey special limitations and fulfil special duties. In the period when the state of emergency or the state of war are promulgated, field courts become a part of the system of courts.

## Iv. Forces And Means Of Defence , Tasks And Mission Of Their Institutions 1. State Control Bodies

The state institutions are responsible for the Czech Republic defence control within the scale of their competencies in accordance with the Constitution and laws.

The state of threat to the country and the state of war are promulgated by the CR Parliament on the motion of the CR Government on the whole territory of the state. Actually, the state of war can begin even on the basis of an aggression launched without formal declaration of war.

Dispatching of the ACR units outside the territory of the state has to be approved by the CR
Parliament after being agreed by both its Chambers.

The Czech Republic Government runs the complex system of the state defence. It declares the state of emergency which has to be subsequently approved by the CR Parliament. The state of emergency may be declared either on a limited or on the whole territory of the state.

In accordance with the Constitution Law on the Security of the Czech Republic a State Security Council is set up for the period of the state of threat to the country or the state of war. This Constitutional Law determines even its competence.

For the time out of the state of threat to the country and state of war, the Government establishes its consultative, initiative and co-ordination body responsible for security questions.

Respective ministers and heads of offices are responsible for the processing and implementation of the state defence tasks in different ministries and other central institutions.

Ministry of Defence is a central body of the state administration which co-ordinates the activity of the other central bodies, administration institutions, self-government institutions and legal entities important for the state defence, at the preparation for the state defence, civil protection and at the defence of the country.

The bodies of the state administration and self-government are responsible for the implementation of the defence strategy on regional level within the scale of their duties.

## 2. Armed Forces Of The Czech Republic

Armed Forces of the Czech Republic consist of the Army of the Czech Republic, creating their basis, Civil Protection and Castle Guard.

The Army of the Czech Republic (ACR) was designed for the defence of the state against an external military attack, for fulfilling the peace-keeping and/or peace-making missions and for the defence in accordance with the obligations of the Czech Republic following from the UN Charter and international agreements. Moreover, it is designed to eliminate the non-military and combined threats that cannot be eliminated by the other bodies designed to do it because of their extent. The ACR must be able to fulfil successfully the tasks of the state defence within the whole extent both by its own forces and in co-operation with the armed forces of its possible allies.

Depending on the economic capabilities of the state and limitations set for the Ministry of Defence by the CR Government, the ACR must have at its disposal such number of military professionals and conscripts equipped with necessary equipment and, from the logistics point of view, supported on such a level that, on the basis of this number, it must be able to complete successfully the war strength within the mobilisation and, by means of an active participation of the ACR in the solution of crisis situation, to fulfil the mission assigned by the law.

Civil Protection of the Czech Republic fulfils humanitarian missions protecting the civil population against a danger and helps the population to eliminate the immediate impacts of an armed conflict, crisis situation and serious incidents and to create essential conditions for its survival.

Castle Guard is assigned for the protection of the office and residence of the head of state.

Beside the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic there are Police of the Czech Republic, Prison Guard, Custom Guard, Civil Intelligence Services, Rescue Corps and Accident Services that also participate in the state defence.

## 3. State Administration And Self-Goverment Bodies

Ministries and other central bodies of the state administration fulfil the missions of defence within their competence assigned by the law.

District offices and municipal councils having competence of the district offices are the territorial administration offices executing the state administration in defence matters on their territory within the extent set by the law. In co-operation with territorial military administrations they provide the needs of the Armed Forces, mobilisation and fulfil independently and initiatively the tasks connected with the solution of serious incidents at natural disasters, accidents or other dangers threatening the lives of citizens, environment or inflicting extensive damage on the property.

Municipalities execute the state administration in the defence matters within a delegated competence assigned by the law.

Territorial Defence Commands as well as military territorial institutions co-ordinate the activity of their subordinate territorial military administrations and control the territorial defence on their territory.

Territorial Military Administration Offices execute the state administration in the field of conscription and state defence. They provide a peace-time, mobilisation and war-time replenishment for the Czech Republic Armed Forces with the personnel and material means; in the areas of expected battlefields, they cooperate in building up the defensive system and its all-round support in accordance with the MOD directions.

Regional Offices of Civil Protection are territorial institutions for the organisation and support of civil protection.

All the mentioned bodies must be ready in the peace-time already and be able to create such structures which will enable them, according to corresponding laws, to fulfil the tasks in the state of emergency, state of threat to the country and in the state of war.

## 4. System Of Economic Mobilisation

The system of economic mobilisation ensures the needs of the state defence for the Armed Forces on the basis of the MOD requirements and the needs for the citizens - on the basis of the requirements of the state administration competent institutions. Selected institutions of the state administration and some selected business subjects are integrated into the system of economic mobilisation as primary elements of the system.

Plans of economic mobilisation of individual subject in crises expressing their activity and measures taken in the state of emergency, state of threat and in the state of war are concrete outputs of the system of economic mobilisation. Development of the mobilisation structure, preservation of production capabilities, creation of state material reserves, special reserves of selected commodities and financial resources belong to the measures of economic mobilisation.

Needs of the state defence are covered by the system of economic mobilisation preferentially from domestic resources complemented by necessary resources from abroad. For this reason it participates in operational preparation of the state territory and in the provision of strategic raw materials partially in the peace-time, state of emergency, state of threat and, in a full range, in the state of war.

## 5. Citizens

Within an extent given by the law, citizens are obliged to participate in the defence in different crisis situations when the interests of the Czech Republic, health and security of citizens are threatened. Then, on the basis of their moral values, abilities and capabilities , they participate in the defence within an extent exceeding their duty.

To involve the citizens in the defence in the situations asking for the use of the ACR and their preparation for such situations, the conscription has been instituted. Personnel of the ACR are the citizens wearing uniforms and carrying weapons. It holds the same for the personnel of the other armed forces. All citizens should be aware that the civil population will not stand aside in a possible future war. Those who will not take part in the struggle on the side of their own fighting army could be abused by the army of the enemy to enforce its aggressive goals and to use them as hostages. Potential future enemy will not probably respect human rights of the civil population. The country will be successful in defending only by totally mobilised civic and national community with the ACR as the basic and the most important component.

## V. Resources For Defence

The defence of the Czech Republic is conditioned by the state and character of the population, material and financial resources used in defence.

The ministries elaborate conception of development including the measures for the implementation of their function in the field of defence. The conceptions of development of the ministries make the basis for short-term and middle-term planning. Individual conceptions should be approved by the CR Government.

State of population in the Czech Republic and expected trends of its development ensure the personnel replacement of the armed forces in the peace-time, state of threat and in war-time. The peace-time strength of the ACR is maintained within 0.5 - 0.6 % of the population; planned war-time strength is 5-6 times higher.

Material resources are provided particularly by the Czech Republic industry.

The system of economic mobilisation supplies the armed forces and population, implements necessary measures and regulation restrictions in the state administration and economy, maintains the state material reserves on a prescribed level and structure and creates favourable conditions for a full material support of the initial period of the state of war and for the transition to war production and war economy.

Measures concerning the economic mobilisation and infrastructure are being prepared by the authorised state administration bodies already in peace. The military structure completely ensures the activity of the armed forces and its program is directed to achieve compatibility with NATO.

Quantity and composition of the ACR material supplies will be gradually approaching NATO standards so that the ACR may reach the standards in the time when the CR Government determines.

Financial resources to cover the defence expenditures are ensured by the national budget. In the state of threat to the country and in the state of war, the remaining assets of the state and all the necessary and from the legal regulations point of view accessible resources will be used on the basis of the CR Parliament decision.

Appropriate measures in the field of legislation together with financial reserves make an inseparable part of ensuring the defence. Alternative options for the solution of the situation will be prepared especially in the area of taxes, currency, prices, wages, payment relations, lending, saving, banking, stock market, capital movement, insurance and state property management.

## Vi. Defence Planning

Defence planning is a summary of activities and relations performed by the state institutions in order to specify the needs, objectives and missions of the state defence, procedures and terms of their accomplishment while considering the existing political, military and economic requirements and efficient use of the resources.

The defence planning includes an advanced enough preparation of strategic defence of the state, specification of character, value and tasks of the armed forces, activity of the state administration institutions, self-government and legal persons, tasks of economic mobilisation and the mobilisation structure, extent and way of the population preparation, and the system of war management of the state under the conditions of standard war operations as well as non-standard activities during the crises having different character and intensity.

Al the state institutions and self government bodies are involved in the defence planning. The state defence planning solves both external and internal security of the state, civil emergency planning, elimination of the impacts of large disasters and accidents, measures against serious terrorist activities of sabotage and crime, use of material reserves of the state and development of an emergency infrastructure of the state.

The defence is planning is continuos and performed on the basis of decisions of the highest state institutions already in peace-time. The CR Government is responsible for the defence planning and the MOD is responsible for its co-ordination. The other state institutions and territorial administration authorities organise the preparation of their ministries and subordinate sectors within they own terms of references.

## Vii. Conclusion

Implementation of the measures of the national defence strategy is a continuous process influenced by the development of security situation and security system in both European and global scale, by economic abilities of the state, conditions within integration of the Czech Republic into NATO and, consequently into European Union and West European Union, and, by a number of other political, economic and military aspects.

The national defence strategy makes the basis for adoption of laws, conceptions, and partial strategies of the ministries and state institutions in the area of defence.

Note:
The National Defence Strategy of the Czech Republic was discussed and approved by the Government on March 26, 1997 with the condition that it will be specified annually in case that the effect of changes of the aspect influencing on the national defence strategy will ask for such a need.
