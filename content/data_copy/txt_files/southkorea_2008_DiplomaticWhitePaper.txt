## Minister’s Message

#### 2007, the final year of the Roh Moo-hyun administration, was a year in which
the nation faced a number of major diplomatic tasks and challenges, amongst them the North
Korean nuclear issue, the ROK-U. S. FTA, and the abduction of Korean nationals in
Afghanistan, to name a few.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MOFAT), has strived to promote our
national interest and further enhance our national image through the resolution of various
diplomatic issues and tasks. Furthermore, we have focussed on enhancing our diplomatic
infrastructure through structural reorganization and the strengthening of our human resources,
with the aim of elevating our diplomatic capabilities to ensure that they fully reflect our
national capacity and international stature. Yet we feel that there is still room for further
improvements in these efforts.

MOFAT has focused on fostering thriving ties with nations around the world through
summit meetings at the bilateral and multilateral levels and participation in various forms of
regional cooperation efforts, thereby expanding our diplomatic horizons. In addition, we have
worked in earnest to promote peace and stability in Northeast Asia, exerting efforts to resolve
the North Korean nuclear issue. We have also explored new possibilities for the development
and expansion of our economy.

The Six-Party Talks, which had been stalled since the “September 19 Joint Statement”
of 2005, due to the so-called BDA (Banco Delta Asia) issue, were resumed. Through a
process of close cooperation between the participating countries, the “February 13
Agreement” and the “October 3 Agreement” were adopted in 2007, thereby laying the
foundation for a comprehensive resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue. However, it
was disappointing to see that nuclear declaration and disablement measures were not
completed prior to the deadline of the end of 2007.


completed prior to the deadline of the end of 2007.

2008 Diplomatic White Paper

In the economic and trade areas, with the aim of contributing to the nation’s stable
economic growth, the Korean Government has pursued the conclusion of Free Trade
Agreements with major trade partners, including the U. S. and the EU, and has actively
participated in the multilateral negotiations of the WTO as well. In particular, despite the
many difficulties experienced in the negotiations process, the conclusion of the ROK-U.S.
FTA in April was quite a meaningful achievement.

In addition, MOFAT has rendered its full support for the efforts to secure the hosting of
major international events, working in close cooperation with local governments, relevant
organizations and the private sector. These endeavors have borne fruit, with Korea succeeding
in securing the hosting of the 2011 IAAF World Championships in Athletics in Daegu, the
2012 International Exposition in Yeosu, and the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon.

Furthermore, the Ministry has exerted earnest efforts to prevent any recurrence of cases
such as the abduction in Afghanistan last year, where innocent people were victimized. To
this end, we have reviewed and enhanced the infrastructure for the protection of Korean
nationals abroad. And, MOFAT has dedicated much efforts to provide consular services that
meet the growing demands and expectations of the public.

In diplomacy, it is important to strike a harmonious balance between continuity and
change. In particular, 2008 is the year of the launch of the Lee Myung-bak administration.
Pursuant to the theme of “creative pragmatism”, the Ministry will earnestly pursue still more
active diplomacy, promoting our national interest and embracing a balanced perspective in an
era of constant change. Furthermore, we will focus on nurturing Korea into a “truly advanced
and globally prestigious country”, the vision embraced by the new government, taking us
closer to fully realizing the goal of building a truly “Global Korea.”

It is my sincere hope that this Diplomatic White Paper will serve as a useful guide,
fostering still greater interest amongst the people in our diplomacy and enabling the citizens to
gain an even deeper understanding of our diplomatic endeavors. I look forward to the
continued invaluable support and encouragement by the public for the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and Trade in our pursuit of realizing diplomacy that is in tandem with the wishes of the
people.


Affairs and Trade in our pursuit of realizing diplomacy that is in tandem with the wishes of the

#### World Trends and Korea’s Foreign Policy in 2007


Chapter 1 Introduction

Chapter 2 Korea’s Foreign Policy in 2007


-----

###### Chapter 1 Introduction

 1. World Politics

< Overview >

In the year 2007, a number of notable trends were evident in international
politics. There were signs of shifts in the global power structure and major
nations saw a change of government. There was greater recognition of the
urgency of issues such as nuclear proliferation and climate change. Furthermore,
the issue of UN Security Council reform has resurfaced.
First, whilst the state of affairs in Iraq and Iran gave rise to doubts about the
moral leadership of the U.S. in the international community, there was a rapid
increase in the economic and military influence of China and Russia. Some
developing countries such as India expanded their international influence. With
EU leaders signing the Reform Treaty which includes the creation of posts of a
permanent EU Council President and a High Representative of the Union for
Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Europe laid the basis for a stronger single
voice in the world. Amidst emerging changes in the relations between global
powers, major nations such as Japan, France, Australia, and the UK underwent a
change of government in 2007, leading to further change in their foreign policy
and the global power dynamics.
Second, there was greater recognition of the urgent need for international
efforts to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime in the wake of the
entering into force of a nuclear cooperation agreement between the U.S. and
India, North Korea’s overdue declaration as part of the nuclear disablement
follow-up measures, and Iran’s pushing ahead with its nuclear program. The SixParty Talks and the diplomatic efforts by the participating countries lead to the
adoption of the 「February 13 Agreement」and the 「October 3 Agreement」,


-----

representing bright prospects for steps forward in resolving the North Korean
nuclear issue. Little signs of progress, however, are evident in the follow-up
measures due to the overdue declaration of its nuclear programs by North Korea.
Meanwhile, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted a second resolution
imposing sanctions on Iran in March 2007,[1)] calling on the country to stop its
nuclear activities altogether. However, with a U.S. National Intelligence Estimate
released in December finding that Iran had halted its nuclear weapons program
in 2003, this raised questions about the reliability of the Bush administration’s
foreign policy toward Iran.
Third, as the world turned its attention to the danger of environmental
issues and climate change, international and regional efforts were evident to
strengthen cooperation such as the adoption in December 2007 of the Bali
Roadmap, a medium-term plan for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
The Bali Roadmap, acknowledging the urgency of the challenges climate change
poses, requires the member countries to make deep cuts in global emissions, and
negotiations on the post-2012 climate change framework[2)] to be completed by
the end of 2009.
Fourth, the issue of UN Security Council reform came to the fore again as
the UN Open-Ended Working Group adopted its progress report for the 61[st]

Session of the General Assembly (2006) in September 2007. The report includes a
reference to undertaking “intergovernmental negotiations”during the next
session of the General Assembly on the expansion of both permanent and nonpermanent membership, a proposal backed by the nations which have strongly
urged for the Security Council to be expanded. With the adoption of this report,
it is expected that candidates for permanent seats will take a more active and
aggressive approach toward UN Security Council reform.


1) The first resolution was adopted in December 2006.
2) The so-called “post-Kyoto regime.”


-----

< Regional Trends >

The U.S., while maintaining the broad framework of counter-terrorism and
non-proliferation of WMD, pursued “unilateral multilateralism,”an endeavor to
move beyond the former unilateral approach towards a multilateral approach
appropriate to each situation and time. Furthermore, in an effort to achieve the
administration’s initial foreign policy goals in the Middle East - securing a foothold
in Africa and gaining access to the energy resources of the Caspian Sea - the U.S.
reconsidered its foreign policy toward Iraq and Iran, and approved a plan in
December for the largest readjustment of American forces overseas since World
War II. According to the readjustment plan,[3)] the U.S. will increase the size of the
active-duty Army by 65,000 soldiers, or by 74,000 including the Army National
Guard and Reserve, to a total of 547,000, and reduce the number of U.S. troops
stationed in Europe. Overall, a full one third of all the soldiers in the Army will
have been restationed by 2011.
At a Special Summit in Lisbon, Portugal on 13 December 2007, EU leaders
signed the Reform Treaty replacing the EU Constitutional Treaty, bringing fresh
momentum for the integration of the EU. The EU Reform Treaty created the new
posts of a permanent Council President,[4)] who represents the EU domestically
and internationally, and a High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs
and Security Policy[5)] responsible for Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP),
according greater power to the EU’s central organizations. With Bulgaria and
Romania joining the EU in 2007, the EU has emerged as a regional union
encompassing Western and Eastern Europe.[6)]

In Southeast Asia, the regional integration efforts centering around ASEAN


3) This readjustment plan is a modified and confirmed version of the Global Defense Posture Review
(GDPR), which President Bush presented as part of his military force readjustment plan.
4) Also known as President, who is elected for a two-and-a-half year tenure, renewable for one further term.
5) Also known as Foreign Minister who is elected for a five year term and also serves as a Vice-President of
the Commission.
6) A huge political and economic community of 27 member states with 490 million citizens and a GDP of
13 trillion dollars.

gathered pace. At the 12[th] ASEAN Summit in January 2007, leaders of the ten
ASEAN member countries agreed to bring the establishment of the ASEAN
Community forward to 2015 from the initially scheduled 2020. At the 13[th] ASEAN
Summit held in Singapore in November, the member countries signed the ASEAN
Charter, which confers a legal personality upon ASEAN, and signed a Declaration
on the ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint. In addition, at the Summit,
leaders of the member countries agreed to come up with blueprints for an
ASEAN Political and Security Community (APSC) and ASEAN Socio-Cultural
Community (ASCC) prior to the holding of the next summit in Thailand in 2008.
Moreover, the leaders of 16 countries - the 10 ASEAN member states plus Korea,
China, Japan, India, Australia, and New Zealand - gathered for the third East Asia
Summit (EAS) held in Singapore in November, engaging in extensive strategic
dialogue on major regional and international issues, climate change and energy,
and the future of the EAS.
In Latin America, many countries joined the popular leftist movements as
left of center and left-wing leaders were elected in the region. Some leftist
governments have taken a disapproving standpoint with respect to the neoliberalism of the previous governments and the foreign policy of the United
States. In particular, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez declared the
nationalization of the country’s resources in 2007, emerging as the leader of the
“anti-American alliance.”Bolivia, Ecuador, Uruguay, Chile, and Argentina
jumped on the nationalization bandwagon, bringing confusion to the
international commodity market.
The Middle East suffered another year of perennial conflict resulting from
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the political instability in Iraq and Afghanistan,
Iran’s nuclear program, and major political shifts in Lebanon. In the IsraeliPalestinian conflict, the biggest in the region, some progress was evident with the
Middle East Peace Conference on November 27, 2007 in Annapolis, the U.S.,
bringing together officials from more than 40 countries, at which Israel and
Palestine agreed to immediately launch good faith bilateral negotiations in order
to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues before the end of


-----

2008. The Bush administration’s “surge”strategy is believed to have produced
some positive results in Iraq, but the Kurdish nationalist movement and the
internal Shia conflict remain causes of tensions in the area.
In Africa, there has been a sharp decline in civil wars and inter-state
conflict. This improvement, however, is not the result of political democratization
in the region, but in large part the economic recovery boosted by the rising
international commodity and energy prices in 2006 and 2007, which have shifted
the people’s attention to economic issues. A sharp drop was also witnessed in
intra-state conflict in the region, which is attributable in large part to the
combined efforts for mediation, arbitration and sanctions by the developed
Western nations and the international community such as the UN and the African
Union. Moreover, China, the EU[7)] and the U.S.[8)] have accelerated the pace of
moves to enter Africa as part of their efforts to secure energy and mineral
resources.

###### 2. World Economy

Despite the slowdown in the U.S. economy and the continued rise in oil
and commodity prices, the world economy recorded an annual growth rate of
4.9%[9)] in 2007 thanks to the continuing robust performance of emerging market
economies such as China and India, and the stable growth of the Japanese
economy and the EU economy. In the second half of the year, however, the
financial institutions affected by the collapse of the U.S. subprime mortgage
market (hereinafter referred to as the “subprime mortgage crisis”) announced


7) The EU held the second EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon, Portugal, in December 2007, seven years after the
first EU-Africa Summit took place in Cairo, in 2000.
8) The U.S. established the United States Africa Command (AFRICOM) as an independent command from
the United States Europe Command (EUROCOM). AFRICOM officially became operational in October
2007.

-----

huge financial losses, sending jitters through the global financial markets. As a
result, the world economy experienced a slowdown principally in advanced
market economies.
The U.S. economy enjoyed robust exports and steady growth in
corporate investment and private consumption, but the worsening housing
market dragged the growth down to 2.2% compared with a figure of 2.9% in
the previous year. In particular, in the second half, as the impacts of the
subprime mortgage crisis began to spread in earnest, they dampened the
housing market and hurt consumer sentiment, intensifying concerns over a
sharp economic recession.
The Japanese economy achieved a mild recovery in domestic consumption, and with the expansion of capital investment and robust exports to
European and emerging markets, Japan experienced an economic expansion.
In the second half, however, the strong yen and the bearish stock market
affected by the effects of the subprime mortgage crisis, and the commodity
price hike hindered a full-fledged economic recovery.
The Chinese economy, a new driving force in the global economy,
continued to grow at a rapid pace of 11.4% in 2007 with a strong performance
in domestic investment, consumption and exports. In an effort to avoid the
overheating of the economy, the Chinese government has taken a series of
actions such as raising interest rates and the bank reserve ratio, restraining
investment, and regulating the real estate market. Nonetheless, there are
growing inflation concerns in the Chinese economy as the total amount of
money in circulation increases at an accelerating pace, and consumer prices
continue their upward trend.
As for the Asian economies other than Korea, China, and Japan,
although they suffered a slowdown in exports due to the concerns over the
U.S. economy, they enjoyed solid growth thanks to increasing domestic
consumption and trade within the region. In particular, the growth rate of the
Philippine economy recorded a 30-year high at 7%. The Indian economy grew
by an impressive 9%.


-----

Russia continued to grow at a healthy pace of around 7% thanks to the
increasing energy exports backed by high oil prices, strong private
consumption, and increased infrastructure spending. The EU economy, despite
the strong euro, grew by 2.6% owing to increased investment and strong
exports to Asian emerging markets, Russia, and the Middle Eastern countries.
However the market concerns over the subprime mortgage crisis, and the
ensuing credit crunch and increases in interest rates dampened investment
sentiment. The German economy demonstrated healthy exports and
investment, but, compared with the previous year, the growth slowed down
somewhat with the VAT increase in early 2007, weakening private
consumption. The economic growth of the French economy fell short of 2%
due to sluggish private consumption and growing uncertainties over the
presidential election.
Oil prices, which stabilized somewhat at the end of 2006, rebounded in
early 2007 and continued their upward march. Although there was a temporary
fall in the prices in July as the economy shrank owing to the subprime
mortgage crisis, the upward trend continued well into the end of the year. Of
all the non-fuel commodities, the grain price increase was the steepest. This
grain price hike may be attributed to the imbalance between supply and
demand triggered by the rising demand for biofuel and industrialization in
emerging market economies.
In 2007, there were some preparatory negotiations among working-level
officials as part of the WTO-led global trade liberalization efforts, but no
significant breakthrough was made to keep the negotiations going. With the
negotiations in a stalemate, many countries around the world turned to regional
trade agreements. In 2007, eight new regional trade agreements were notified
to the WTO and came into effect.


-----

###### 3. Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia

The year 2007 in Northeast Asia was characterized by greater flexibility in
the U.S. foreign policy toward Asia-Pacific countries, Japan’s promotion of
Asian diplomacy, and thriving ties of cooperation between China and Russia,
along with international efforts to address the North Korean nuclear issue. In
addition, a “rising China”and a “returning Russia”were noteworthy
phenomena in 2007.
With regard to international efforts to address the North Korean nuclear
issue, with the successful adoption of the Initial Actions for the Implementation
of the Joint Statement on February 13, 2007, five Working Groups for detailed
and earnest negotiations were established. Then came the adoption of the
Second-Phase Actions for the Implementation of the Joint Statement, namely
the October 3 Agreement. In this the DPRK agreed to complete the disablement
of the core nuclear facilities at Yongbyon and to provide a complete and
correct declaration of North Korea’s nuclear programs by the end of the year.
However, as concerns about possible nuclear cooperation between North
Korea and Syria grow and North Korea fails to fully implement the agreements,
little progress is currently being made in implementing the agreements.
As indicated, the U.S. has given top priority to non-traditional security
measures such as counter-terrorism and non-proliferation since the 9.11
terrorist attacks, and has placed the spread of freedom and democracy at the
center of its foreign policy. In the same vein, the U.S. stepped up its efforts to
reinforce the existing alliance network and establish new strategic solidarity.
More specifically, with the Japan-Australia Joint Declaration on Security
Cooperation, the U.S. has incorporated Australia into the framework of the
U.S.-Japan alliance, launching the trilateral security cooperation among the
U.S., Japan, and Australia. In addition, the conclusion of the nuclear
cooperation agreement between the U.S. and India in July has served to take
the efforts to forge closer ties with India one stage further. These recent moves
by the U.S. indicate that the country is intent on expanding military


-----

cooperation that bridges the Asia-Pacific region and the neighboring areas. The
U.S. is also actively engaged in the strengthening of the counter-terrorism
cooperation, development and deployment of a missile defense (MD) system,
and expansion of Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) exercises.
China set as a national goal the pursuit of a so-called “harmonious world”
building upon its economic development, and political and social stability. As
part of such efforts, China has endeavored to secure an engine for sustainable
growth and an elevated status on the global stage. China has actively
participated in various multilateral diplomatic efforts such as the ASEAN+3
Summit and Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Summit. Moreover, the
country has also focused its efforts on expanding economic collaboration with
oil-producing countries and resource-rich countries in Africa, the Middle East,
and Latin America. China engaged in discussions with the U.S. on ways to
address economic and trade issues facing the two countries at the second U.S.China Strategic Economic Dialogue in May in Washington and the third U.S.China Strategic Economic Dialogue in December in Beijing. The fourth U.S.China High-level Talks took place in June, and on the occasion of the APEC
Summit in Sydney, Australia, Chinese President Hu Jintao had a summit with
U.S. President Bush. Moreover, an atmosphere of reconciliation and
cooperation was fostered in 2007 between China and Japan, as evidenced by a
series of high-level talks, mutual port visits of naval vessels between the Japan
Maritime Self-Defense Force and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, and the
agreement to consider setting up a hot line between the two forces. China is
strengthening and expanding its ties with Russia in the political, economic,
military, and security fields. One example of such cooperation would be the
Peace Mission 2007 joint military exercise, which was carried out in the SCO
framework in August 2007.
Japan continued its efforts to strengthen its alliance with the U.S., and
also endeavored to improve relations with its estranged neighboring countries
as part of its promotion of Asian diplomacy. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe had a summit with Australian Prime Minister John Howard in March, and


-----

the Japan-Australia Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation was issued,
calling for broad cooperation on security issues such as counter-terrorism, the
non-proliferation of WMD, and humanitarian aid. With this declaration close
military cooperation among the U.S., Japan and Australia has also been
established. Moreover, Japan exerted sincere efforts to improve its relations
with China. As the economic partnership between China and Japan deepens,
the Japanese Prime Minister held talks with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao in
April in Japan, agreeing to establish a mechanism for high-level economic
dialogue with China. Japan and China also held Defense Minister Talks in
August, significantly narrowing their differences on mutual confidence-building
measures in the field of security.
As Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda took office following the abrupt
resignation of his predecessor, Shinzo Abe, Japan’s attempts to amend the
Constitution and reinterpret it, as part of its efforts to strengthen the U.S.-Japan
alliance, were put on hold or set aside for a cautious reexamination. In
particular, there were growing political tensions in 2007 surrounding the AntiTerrorism Special Measures Law and a bill related to the overseas dispatch of
the Self-Defense Forces. Against this backdrop, Japan’s steps toward becoming
a “normal state”were somewhat hindered. Meanwhile, an atmosphere of
reconciliation between Japan and China is evident as Japanese Prime Minister
Fukuda has visited China and held a series of talks with the Chinese leadership
including President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao, announcing a “mutually
beneficial strategic relationship”in a broad range of fields.
Russia is striving to reestablish itself as a global power by making the
most of the unprecedented economic boom driven by the skyrocketing
international oil and commodity prices of late. Russia was diplomatically at
odds with the U.S. and the EU over the issues of the deployment of MD in
Eastern Europe, Iran’s nuclear program and Kosovo’s independence. Russian
President Vladimir Putin and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad clearly
stated at the Russia-Iran Summit in October that Iran has the right to use nuclear
energy for peaceful purposes, opposing military actions by the U.S. and the


-----

other Western European countries against Iran. Moreover, Russia is maintaining
close relations with China. Russia designated 2007 the “Year of China,”and
strengthened its military cooperation with China through the SCO six nation
joint military exercises and arms exports to China.
As for North Korea’s foreign relations in 2007, the North seemed to have
been slowly breaking away from the international isolation following its nuclear
test. The outlook for North Korea-U.S. relations was generally bright with the
adoption of the February 13 Agreement and the Working Group Talks. North
Korea returned the remains of missing U.S. soldiers in April, and the U.S.
carried out a military operation to rescue the sailors of the North Korean cargo
ship “Daehongdan,”who were abducted by Somali pirates. However, North
Korea is not faithfully implementing the agreements on denuclearization, and
the U.S. is criticizing North Korea’s human rights situation, eliciting a bitter
response from North Korea. Given this, the prospects for North Korea-U.S.
relations are still not clear. North Korea and China were somewhat estranged
due to China’s decision to vote, in the aftermath of North Korea’s nuclear test,
for UN Security Council Resolution 1718, imposing sanctions on North Korea.
However, the relations recovered somewhat after the February 13 Agreement.
They resumed political and military cooperation, and the volume of trade is
also on the rise. In 2007, North Korea’s abductions of Japanese citizens
continued to be a significant obstacle to improvements in the bilateral relations.
Moreover, with the Japanese government still adhering to its policy of sanctions
against North Korea, the Working Group Talks for the normalization of North
Korea-Japan relations ended with no tangible results. Moreover, there have
been no signs of change in this situation since the launch of the Fukuda
administration. Despite Russia’s cooperation regarding the resolution of the
BDA issue and the efforts to regain its influence on North Korea in 2007, the
issue of North Korea’s debt to Russia is still a major stumbling block to North
Korea-Russia relations.

###### Chapter 2 Korea’s Foreign Policy in 2007

In 2007, the last year of the Roh administration, in the conduct of foreign
policy the ROK placed priority on five major objectives: 1) pursuing peace and
prosperity on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia; 2) promoting international
cooperation and enhancing the national image; 3) strengthening economic and trade
diplomacy; 4) protecting Korean nationals abroad, improving consular services, and
strengthening public outreach; and 5) enhancing diplomatic capacity.


###### Pursuing Peace and Prosperity in Northeast Asia

Against an unfavorable backdrop, including the missile and nuclear tests
by North Korea in 2006, the Republic of Korea, in cooperation with the parties
concerned, exerted earnest efforts to convince North Korea to return to the SixParty Talks and, as follow-up measures for the implementation of the
September 19 Joint Statement, the February 13 Agreement and the October 3
Agreement were produced. These agreements have contributed to the
resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue in some degree, but the issue has
not yet been fully resolved due to such factors as the delay in submitting a
complete and correct declaration of its nuclear programs.
Moreover, the Republic of Korea has endeavored to strengthen relations
with neighboring countries. With regard to relations with the United States,
Korea has strived to enhance policy consultations, to foster greater support
within the U.S. for the ROK and to resolve pending issues relating to the ROKU.S. alliance. Moreover, the negotiations on the KORUS Free Trade Agreement
were finally concluded in 2007 and close consultations for Korea’s entry into
the U.S. Visa Waiver Program were held on several occasions.
In addition, although conflicts over history-related issues have been an
obstacle to the development of the political relations between Korea and Japan,


#### Ⅰ


-----

the two countries have constantly expanded exchanges in the economic and
cultural fields. With regard to China, since the “Comprehensive and
Cooperative Partnership”between Korea and China was declared, the two
sides have promoted bilateral cooperation in various areas including the
political, diplomatic, economic and cultural fields. As for Russia, the Korean
government has increased substantial cooperation not only on the resolution of
the North Korean nuclear issue but also on energy development projects in Far
East Siberia and aerospace technology.

###### Promoting International Cooperation and Enhancing the National Image

To meet the international expectations of the Republic of Korea, the
government has strived to expand its international contribution to a level that
befits its economic standing. In particular, Korea has not only assumed a
greater role in a number of international organizations, but also strived to
increase Official Development Assistance (ODA), actively participate in Peace
Keeping Operations (PKO) and reinforce its cultural diplomacy.
The Korean government has increased the level of ODA, with the aim of
helping developing countries, from $210 million in 2000 to $450 million in
2007. Korea has also expanded its participation in UN PKO activities in order to
support the firm establishment of peace in the international community. For
example, it dispatched troops to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon
(UNIFIL) in July 2007. In addition, the government has exerted endeavors for
the spread of democracy across the world by participating in the ‘Community
of Democracies’and ‘Partnership for Democratic Governance’as a founding
member. It has also been making a significant contribution to addressing global
issues such as disarmament and non-proliferation activities, and international
cooperation against terrorism.
In the field of cultural diplomacy, MOFAT has carried out a variety of


#### Ⅱ


-----

diplomatic activities including support for overseas performances by Korean Art
Groups and strengthening of the uniqueness and ingenuity of Korean Art
through various permanent exhibitions in embassies and consulates abroad. In
addition, MOFAT fully supported the Korea’s bid to host international events
such as the 2011 Daegu IAAF World Championships in Athletics, the 2012
International Exposition Yeosu Korea, and the 2014 Incheon Asian Games.

###### Strengthening Economic and Trade Diplomacy

MOFAT has strengthened economic and trade diplomacy with the aim of
securing stable overseas markets and enhancing international competitiveness.
First of all, in keeping with the worldwide trend of trade liberalization and
economic blocs forming across the world, it has exerted efforts to pursue
further FTAs. As a result, Korea concluded the negotiations for the FTA with the
United States in April 2007 and is carrying out FTA negotiations with the EU,
Canada, India, Mexico and other countries in various continents.
As for energy and resources diplomacy, as well as the successive visits by
the President to three Middle Eastern Countries in March, the Korea-Iraq
Ministerial Meeting on Energy was held in April and the Korea-Iraq Resources
Cooperation Commission was held in September 2007. Moreover, the ROK has
also exerted efforts to strengthen environmental cooperation in Northeast Asian
countries, holding an Environmental Cooperation Commission with China in
June, with Japan in July and with Russia in November, and the ninth KoreaChina-Japan Environment Ministers Meeting in December.
As a part of economic and trade diplomacy, the government has
endeavored to resolve pending issues with major trade partners such as the
U.S., Japan, China and the EU through various channels for bilateral
consultations. Moreover, responding to unfair import restrictions, MOFAT has
brought these to an amicable settlement by dispatching the Trade Remedy Task
Force or by making full use of the WTO dispute settlement procedure.

#### IV Protecting Korean Nationals Abroad,
###### Improving Consular Services and Strengthening Public Outreach

With the increase in the number of Koreans traveling and living abroad,
reaching 13 million and 7 million respectively, MOFAT is exerting earnest
efforts to ensure the safety of Korean people traveling overseas as well as
facilitate the greater convenience of their stay abroad, and to promote the rights
and interests of overseas Koreans.
With regard to the protection of Korean nationals, MOFAT has reinforced
its institutions and employed diverse measures aimed at preventing possible
incidents in advance and handling promptly and timely emergencies. For
instance, it has strengthened the functions of the Consular Call Center, operated
the Rapid Response Team, expanded the Overseas Emergency Alert System
through SMS text messages, and introduced the Consular Assistant System.
Furthermore, MOFAT has also exerted diplomatic efforts to deal with incidents
such as the kidnapping of Daewoo Engineering and Construction employees in
Nigeria, sinking of the Golden Rose off the coast of Dalian, and the abduction
by the Taliban in Afghanistan.
Moreover, in order to facilitate the convenience of Koreans traveling
overseas, MOFAT has been pursuing the conclusion of agreements related to
consular services including a Visa Waiver Program (VWP) with the United
States and improving the quality of consular services. Moreover, MOFAT has
endeavored to enhance the rights and interests of overseas Koreans, such as the
designation of October 5[th] as worldwide ‘Korean Day’and the holding of the
Sixth World Korean Business Convention in October.
In addition, MOFAT carried out various public outreach activities
including the foreign policy lecture tour and Visit MOFAT Program so as to
secure public support for the government’s foreign policies and to facilitate
two-way communication with the people.


#### IV


-----

#### V


MOFAT has continued to exert efforts to strengthen diplomatic capacity to
cope with the rapidly changing situation in the 21[st] century.
In July 2007, MOFAT introduced restructuring measures including the
creation of the ‘Bureau of Development Cooperation,’mainly focusing on
effectively and systematically undertaking tasks related to Official Development
Assistance (ODA) intended for developing countries. Moreover, it has strived to
expand and improve the network of Korean Foreign Service posts in order to
strengthen consular services for Korean companies and Korean nationals
abroad. Furthermore, MOFAT has continued to pursue innovation in human
resources planning, employing a range of diverse methods: recruiting through
public advertisement for attache posts; and expanding special recruitment to、
find expert personnel with diverse backgrounds.

###### Chapter 1 Pursuing a Resolution of the North Korean Nuclear Issue

 1. Adoption of the 「February 13 Agreement」

1) Efforts to Resolve the BDA Issue and the Resumption of the
Six-Party Talks

In an effort to implement the Joint Statement of September 19 2005, the
Second Session of the Fifth Round of Six-Party Talks was held from December
18 to 22, 2006, in Beijing. At the meeting, the concerned Parties agreed to take
phased measures to achieve the goal of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.
However, the session had to settle for the adoption of the Chairman’s
Statement due to the DPRK’s insistence on resolving the BDA issue[10)] first. As
this led to a situation in which the Parties were no longer able to hold further
discussions on key issues, the meeting entered into recess.
The ROK government continued its efforts to maintain momentum in
resolving the North Korean nuclear issue through the prompt resumption of the
Six-Party Talks. Efforts were concentrated on building close cooperation with
the U.S. and persuading the DPRK to be more flexible on its terms.
At the ROK-U.S. Foreign Ministerial Meeting in early January 2007, the two
countries held discussions on measures to resume the Six-Party Talks and on the
future course of action. In addition, the head delegates of the ROK and the U.S.
to the Six-Party Talks, on the occasion of the ROK Foreign Minister’s visit to the


10) On September 15, 2005, the U.S. Department of the Treasury designated Banco Delta Asia (BDA), a
Macao-based bank, as a “primary money laundering concern”under Section 311 of the U.S. Patriot
Act on suspicion of money laundering for the DPRK government and other financial transgressions, and
issued a proposed rule-making that imposes special measures against BDA. Due to the actions taken
by the U.S. government, there was a bank run by depositors for fear of BDA’s bankruptcy. Accordingly,
Macao’s monetary authority took control of the bank and froze $25 million worth of DPRK funds.


-----

U.S., held discussions on concrete goals for the next Six-Party Talks and
coordination measures between the two allies.
Based upon such coordinated actions, the U.S. began to exert more efforts
in engaging the DPRK in dialogue, convening the U.S.-DPRK bilateral meeting
in Berlin from January 16 to 18, 2007. During the meeting, the two sides
discussed issues such as resuming the Six-Party Talks through the resolution of
the BDA issue as well as initial measures including the shutdown and sealing of
the Yongbyon nuclear facility.
As a follow-up to this meeting, the U.S. and DPRK officials met in Beijing
from January 30 to 31, 2007 to discuss ways to resolve the BDA issue. As a result
of these efforts, the Third Session of the Fifth Round of the Six-Party Talks was
held in Beijing from February 8 to 13, 2007.


2) The ⌜February 13 Agreement⌟and the Implementation of
Initial Actions for Denuclearization of North Korea

As a result of the consultations on measures to implement the �September
19 Joint Statement.�during the Third Session of the Fifth Round of the Six-Party
Talks, the Parties adopted the �Initial Actions for the Implementation of the


The Third Session of the Fifth Round of the Six-Party Talks (Beijing, February 8, 2007)


-----

Joint Statement�, or the �February 13 Agreement�.
Through this Agreement, the concerned Parties agreed to provide economic
and energy assistance to the DPRK corresponding to its implementation of
denuclearization obligations, to hold discussions on the normalization of U.S.DPRK and Japan-DPRK relations, and to start discussions on the establishment
of a peace regime on the Korean Peninsula and a multilateral security regime in
Northeast Asia.
The main accomplishments and significance of the February 13
Agreement are as follows:
First, compared to the 1994 Agreed Framework which attained limited
success of freezing the DPRK’s nuclear facilities, the February 13 Agreement
agreed on disablement, going beyond the shutdown of the DPRK’s nuclear
facilities.
Second, unlike the 1994 Agreed Framework that guaranteed 500,000 tons
of heavy fuel oil annually to the DPRK for freezing its nuclear facilities, it
adopted a so-called performance-based assistance system under the principle of
“action for action”that would provide rewards for concrete actions and
progress in the denuclearization process by the DPRK. In addition, the Parties
agreed to share the cost of economic and energy assistance for the DPRK
according to the principle of equality and equity.
Third, it provided a mechanism to improve bilateral relations that have
been a stumbling block in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue by agreeing
to start discussions on the normalization of U.S.-DPRK and Japan-DPRK
relations as a corresponding political measure for the denuclearization.
Lastly, for the first time in the region, the Working Group on Northeast
Asia Peace and Security Mechanism provides an opportunity to discuss the
establishment of multilateral inter-governmental security dialogue in Northeast
Asia.

Six-Party Ministerial
Meeting


-----

As a follow-up to the February 13 Agreement, the first meetings of the
five Working Groups were held.
The Working Group meeting on the Denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula was held in Beijing from March 17 to 18, 2007. Parties discussed
action plans for the initial and next-phase measures, and the relationship
between the Working Group and the IAEA.
The Working Group meeting on the Economic and Energy Cooperation
was held in Beijing on March 15. Parties discussed the Initial-Phase provision of
50,000 tons of heavy fuel oil by the ROK and the other Parties’next-phase
assistance.
The Working Group meeting on the Northeast Asia Peace and Security
Mechanism was held in Beijing on March 16. Views were exchanged on main
issues including Northeast Asia’s multilateral security initiative and the future
direction of the Working Group.
The Working Group meeting on the Normalization of U.S.-DPRK
Relations was held in New York from March 5 to 6, 2007. Parties discussed
ways to resolve issues including the Uranium Enrichment Program (UEP) and
removing the DPRK from the list of State Sponsors of Terrorism.[11)]

The Working Group meeting on the Normalization of Japan-DPRK
Relations was held in Hanoi, Vietnam, from March 7 to 8. Views were
exchanged on issues including the unfortunate past and the abduction of
Japanese nationals.


11) “State Sponsor of Terrorism”is a designation applied by the United States to nations that have
repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism. The U.S. imposes on those nations
sanctions such as a ban on arms-related exports and sales and prohibitions on economic assistance.
Countries currently on the list include Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Sudan.


-----

###### 2. Interim Period between the Adoption of the 「February 13 Agreement」and the 「October 3 Agreement」

1) Final Resolution of the BDA Issue


After the conclusion of the five Working Group meetings in mid-March,
the first session of the Sixth Round of Six-Party Talks was held in Beijing from
March 19 to 22, 2007, to start substantive discussions on the implementation of
the February 13 Agreement based upon results from each Working Group
meeting. However, unresolved matters related to the BDA issue prevented
progress. The session concluded with the Parties agreeing to hold the next SixParty Talks at the earliest possible opportunity.
With the Six-Party process at a stalemate due to the BDA issue, a
consensus among the Parties was formed that the BDA issue must be resolved
first in order to make progress in the denuclearization effort. Based upon this
consensus, active consultations between the Parties concerned were made. In
the end, the U.S. and Russia agreed to jointly assist the transfer of North Korea’s
funds with BDA and the matter was finally resolved in June.


2) Moving Toward the Next Phase

At the Heads of Delegation Meeting of the Sixth Round of the Six-Party
Talks held in Beijing from July 18 to 20, 2007, the Parties held discussions on
ways to accelerate the implementation of initial actions for the denuclearization
of North Korea and on specific measures for entering the next phase. Between
July and August 2007, conditions for resuming the Six-Party Talks were met
through the completion of Initial-Phase measures including the ROK’s initial
provision of 50,000 tons of heavy fuel oil, the shutdown and the sealing of


-----

Yongbyon nuclear facilities, and the return of IAEA personnel to Yongbyon to
monitor the denuclearization measures.
Meanwhile, the Parties held second meetings for each of the five Working
Groups between August and September 2007 to accelerate the implementation
of the February 13 Agreement.
During the second Working Group meeting on the Denuclearization of
the Korean Peninsula held in Shenyang from August 16 to 17, 2007, discussions
were targeted on laying the foundation for pursuing the next phase of
denuclearization measures. At the meeting, the concerned countries established
concrete plans for the denuclearization of North Korea including the disablement
and declaration of the DPRK’s nuclear programs by the end of the year.
The second Working Group meeting on the Economic and Energy
Cooperation chaired by the ROK was held in Panmunjeom from August 7 to 8.
The participating countries discussed the basic roadmap for economic and
energy assistance to be provided to North Korea. On the third Working Group
meeting held from October 29 to 30, discussions were held on providing
450,000 tons of heavy fuel oil (excluding the initial provision of 50,000 tons of
heavy fuel oil) and energy-related equipment and materials equivalent to
500,000 tons of heavy fuel oil.
The second Working Group meeting on the Normalization of U.S.-DPRK
Relations was held from September 1 to 2 in Geneva. The two Parties
discussed: the declaration of the DPRK’s nuclear programs and complete
disablement of nuclear facilities; the removal of the DPRK from the list of State
Sponsors of Terrorism and terminating the application of the Trading with the
Enemy Act[12)] to the DPRK.
The second Working Group meeting on the Normalization of JapanDPRK Relations was held from September 5 to 6 in Ulan Bator, Mongolia. The
two Parties aimed at discussing the settlement of historical disputes and the


12) The Trading with the Enemy Act is a U.S. federal law enacted in 1917 to restrict trade with countries
hostile to the U.S. The Act restricts economic activities including exports, imports, and investment with
enemy states. The Act has been applied to the DPRK since 1950.


-----

abduction issue of Japanese nationals.
The second Northeast Asian Peace and Security Mechanism meeting was
held from August 20 to 21 in Moscow to forge a consensus on the need for a
multilateral security cooperation and ways to develop trust in the region.
The progress of the Six-Party Talks process embodied by the February 13
Agreement diminished the external risk factor for the ROK, heralding a positive
effect on its economy. As an example of such a positive outcome, Moody’s
Corporation, a financial research & analysis entity, upgraded the credit rating of
the ROK from A3 to A2 in July 2007, evaluating the ROK as “stable”in its future
credit prospects. Moody’s explained the adjustment as the result of a stable
governance of the economy and the reduction of geo-political risks through the
progress in the Six-Party Talks process including the fulfillment of the February
13 Agreement.


3) Adoption of the ⌜October 3 Agreement⌟

The second session of the Sixth Round of the Six Party Talks was held on
September 27, 2007, in Beijing, after each party had presented its positions on
the denuclearization and economic and energy assistance through the Heads of
Delegation meeting in July 2007, and had held series of second Working Group
meetings. During this meeting, the Six Parties adopted the �Second-Phase
Actions for the Implementation of the Joint Statement�, or the �October 3
Agreement�, as a basis for the implementation of the Joint Statement in a
phased manner.
First, the DPRK reaffirmed its commitment to disable all existing nuclear
facilities and provide a complete and correct declaration of all its nuclear
programs by the end of the year, and to refrain from proliferation of nuclear
material, technology and know-how to other entities.
In return, the other Parties agreed to take corresponding measures toward
the DPRK, such as economic and energy assistance, and to continue their


-----

efforts to normalize bilateral relations. The significance of the October 3
Agreement is that it embodied the concrete action plan for the implementation
of the September 19 Joint Statement.

###### 3. Implementation of the 「October 3 Agreement」

1) Second-Phase Actions for Denuclearization


After the adoption of the October 3 Agreement, the concerned Parties
have sought to advance the implementation of the Second-Phase actions.
First, technical experts from the U.S. visited the DPRK from October 11 to
18 to discuss disablement measures and revisited the country in early November
to implement the measures. In addition, technical experts from other Parties
visited the Yongbyon nuclear facilities to observe the disablement process.
However, the U.S. expressed concern as the DPRK failed to meet the
deadline (December 31, 2007) for the submission of a “complete and correct”
declaration of all its nuclear programs. In a statement by the U.S. Department
of State, the DPRK was urged to make the declaration and complete the
disablement measures. The governments of the ROK and Japan also
emphasized the importance of the early completion of the measures under the
October 3 Agreement.
In the interim, various meetings were held between the concerned Parties
to discuss the declaration issue, which was a key element in the Second-Phase
actions. In January 2008, envoys from the U.S. and China visited the DPRK
respectively and, in February, Assistant Secretary Christopher Hill met with Kim
Gye-Gwan, Vice Foreign Minister of the DPRK, in Beijing, to discuss the
declaration issue. Inter-Korean Heads of Delegation meeting was also held in
Beijing on February 21, 2008, where the ROK side urged the expedited
implementation of the DPRK’s obligations.


2) Economic and Energy Assistance

In addition to the nuclear disablement and declaration issue, economic
and energy assistance toward the DPRK was the other main subject of the


-----

October 3 Agreement. During the ROK-China-DPRK trilateral working-level
meetings from November to December 2007, the Parties reached an agreement
on the burden sharing modality and on specific items to be included in the
equipment and material assistance package.

###### 4. Future Challenges

The North Korean nuclear issue is the highest priority issue to secure
peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, as well as in Northeast Asia, and
ultimately for the international nuclear non-proliferation regime. The Second
Phase of the denuclearization process has been delayed due to the declaration
issue. Despite all the difficulties, the ROK government will continue its
diplomatic efforts toward the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula through
the implementation of the September 19 Joint Statement in close cooperation
with the concerned Parties.
Our immediate tasks are to: △complete the Second-Phase measures
including the submission of a complete and correct declaration of all nuclear
programs by the DPRK, △complete corresponding measures by the other five
Parties such as economic and energy assistance, and △adopt an action plan
for the initiation of the next-phase measures for nuclear dismantlement.
The ROK government will exert its best efforts to lay the foundation for
peace and stability in Northeast Asia through the denuclearization process of
the Korean Peninsula, along with the improvement of inter-Korean relations,
the establishment of a peace regime on the Korean Peninsula and the
reinforcement of multilateral security cooperation in Northeast Asia.


-----

###### Chapter 2 ROK-U.S. Relations

 1. Strengthening the Partnership


In 2007, the Republic of Korea and the United States continued their
efforts to readjust and strengthen the ROK-U.S. alliance, in order to cope with
changing domestic and international environment and meet future security
demands. In an effort to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, the two
countries were able to produce the February 13 Agreement and the October 3
Agreement through close cooperation with other participating members in the
Six-Party Talks. Furthermore, the two countries concluded the Korea-U.S. Free
Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) negotiations and made concrete progress in
their discussions concerning Korea’s participation in the U.S. Visa Waiver
Program (VWP).
In this regard, President Roh Moo-hyun and U.S. President George W.
Bush held one summit meeting and six phone consultations, and discussed
ways to develop the ROK-U.S. alliance, cooperate for the peaceful resolution of
the North Korean nuclear issue, and conclude the FTA negotiations.
On September 7, President Roh and President Bush held a summit
meeting on the occasion of the APEC Economic Leaders’Meeting in Sydney,
Australia. At the summit, the two Presidents reaffirmed their commitment to
develop ROK-U.S. relations into a comprehensive, dynamic, and mutually
beneficial alliance, and further agreed to closely cooperate towards an early
ratification of the KORUS FTA and Korea’s early participation in the U.S. VWP.
In addition, the two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to continue their
efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue through the Six-Party Talks,
noted with satisfaction the two nations’cooperation in Iraq and Afghanistan,
and agreed to continue bilateral cooperation in global issues such as the Doha
Development Agenda and climate change.


-----

In 2007, eight meetings and 23
phone consultations were held
between Foreign Minister Song Minsoon and Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice. On these occasions,
the two ministers discussed ways to
make further progress in the resolution
of the North Korean nuclear issue,
including the implementation of the
February 13 Agreement and the
resolution of the Banco Delta Asia
(BDA) issue. In addition, the two
ministers discussed such issues as the
conclusion of the KORUS FTA, Korea’s
early participation in the U.S. VWP, ROK-U.S. Foreign Ministers’Meeting

(Washington D.C., January 5, 2007)

and the readjustment of the ROK-U.S.
alliance. Moreover, on the occasion of exchanges of high-ranking officials,
regional and global issues including the situation in Northeast Asia, assistance in
peace and reconstruction efforts, the Middle East peace process, and climate
change were discussed along with bilateral and other issues of mutual interest.
Meanwhile, various Korea-related issues, including the North Korean
nuclear issue and the KORUS FTA, were discussed in the U.S. Congress during
2007. The Korean government made efforts to work together with members of
Congress and opinion leaders with influential roles in the formulation of U.S.
foreign policy.
Through such efforts, 「House Resolution 295」, which recognizes the
ROK-U.S. alliance and emphasizes the need to strengthen bilateral relations,
was adopted by the House of Representatives on June 11. On December 9, the
Senate adopted 「Senate Resolution 279」, which recognizes and looks back on
ROK-U.S. relations in commemoration of the 125[th] anniversary of the 「1882
Treaty of Peace, Amity, Commerce and Navigation between the Kingdom of


-----

Chosun (Korea) and the United States」. Meanwhile, the House of
Representatives urged Japan to apologize for its past wrongdoings and called
the international community’s attention to the issue once more by adopting
「House Resolution 121」, also known as the Comfort Women Resolution on
July 30.
On March 30, the Senate Korea Caucus[13)] was established in addition to
the House of Representatives Korea Caucus and the Korea-U.S. InterParliamentary Council, thereby strengthening parliamentary ties between the
two nations.
Moreover, the governments of Korea and the U.S. have continuously
discussed issues related to Korea’s participation in the U.S. VWP. As the 9/11
Commission Act of 2007, which includes 「Section 711 (Modernization of the
Visa Waiver Program)」, came into effect in August 2007, more efforts have
been made to gain the support of Congress and its individual members for
Korea’s early entry into the program. At the same time, the Korean government
has continued to make efforts in securing support for the KORUS FTA from the
business community, state governments, and members of Congress.
Consequently, in 2007, the number of letters of support and public remarks
made by U.S. Congress members with regard to Korea’s position increased by
more than 50 cases compared to 2006.
With the onset of the 2008 U.S. presidential election, exchanges have
been further strengthened with distinguished scholars and opinion leaders in
the U.S. Many eminent members, including both Republicans and Democrats,
of the foreign and security policy community visited Korea and exchanged
ideas on various issues such as the ROK-U.S. alliance, the North Korean
nuclear issue, and Northeast Asian regional issues. Such figures include: Wendy
Sherman, former Counselor of the Department of State; Christopher Bond, U.S.
Senator; John Hamre, CSIS President and CEO; Edwin Feulner, President of


13) The Korea Caucus is composed of members of Congress who are interested in issues concerning
Korea. The House of Representatives’Korea Caucus is the third largest caucus, following the Taiwan
and Israel Caucuses, among the 20 or more regional caucuses. Meanwhile, the Senate’s Korea Caucus
is one of the only five regional caucuses organized in the Senate.

and realignment of U.S. forces in Korea (USFK), defense cost-sharing, and the
transition of wartime operational control.


1) The Transition of Wartime Operational Control

At the 38[th] Security Consultative Meeting (SCM) held on October 20, 2006,
Korea and the U.S. agreed to expeditiously complete the transition of wartime
operational control (OPCON) to Korea after October 15, 2009, but no later than
March 15, 2012. Both sides also agreed to immediately begin developing a
detailed joint implementation plan within the first half of 2007. Thereafter, at
the ROK-U.S. defense ministerial talks held on February 23, 2007, the two
countries reached an agreement that wartime OPCON will be transferred to
Korea on April 17, 2012. Currently, concrete measures are being implemented
for the transition, based on the Strategic Transition Plan (STP) signed on June
28, 2007, between the military authorities of Korea and the U.S.


2) ROK-U.S. Security Policy Initiative

To adapt to the changing security environment, Korea and the U.S. held
12 meetings of the Future of the Alliance Policy Initiatives (FOTA) from January
2003 to September 2004. In the FOTA meetings, the two countries held close
consultations over alliance readjustment, which includes the relocation of the
Yongsan Garrison, the realignment of the U.S. forces in Korea, transfer of
military missions and responsibilities, as well as the enhancement of ROK-U.S.
combined capabilities.
At the 36[th] Security Consultative Meeting (SCM) held in October 2004, the
two sides agreed to launch the Security Policy Initiative (SPI), replacing FOTA,
to discuss ways to further promote the future ROK-U.S. alliance. Since the
launch of the SPI, 16 meetings have been held from February 2005 to January 2008.

Through the SPI consultations, both nations reviewed the progress made
in implementing agreements reached earlier at FOTA, and closely consulted on
the future direction of the ROK-U.S. alliance with a view to responding more
effectively to the changing security environment. The SPI consultations
between the foreign and defense ministries of the two sides have served as an
effective security forum for resolving pending issues concerning the alliance. In
2008, based on the successful outcomes of the previous SPI consultations, both
sides have been continuously engaged in bilateral discussions on issues
concerning the ROK-U.S. alliance.


3) Defense Cost-Sharing

Since 1991, the Korean government, in consideration of the significance
and strategic value of the USFK and Korea’s need to increase its military role
commensurate with its economic development, has shouldered a portion of the
stationing costs of the USFK in accordance with the Special Measures
Agreement Relating to Article V of the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA
Special Agreement). Prior to 2004, the Ministry of Defense led the negotiations
concerning defense cost-sharing. In 2004 and 2006, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and Trade (MOFAT) led the negotiations.


-----

Under close consultations with related agencies, including the Ministry of
Defense, MOFAT held six high-level talks and numerous working-level
negotiations from May to November 2006. As a result, the 2007-2008 Special
Measures Agreement (SMA) was agreed upon in December 2006, and
approved by the National Assembly in April 2007.
According to the 2007-2008 agreement, the cost-sharing contribution of
Korea for 2007 was agreed at 725.5 billion Korean Won, a 6.6% increase from
the previous year. The agreement stipulates that Korea’s contribution for 2008
will be increased by reflecting the inflation rate (the 2006 Consumer Price
Index) on the top of the contribution for 2007. In negotiating this agreement,
the Korean Government took into account that because of Korea’s reductions
in the 2005-2006 cost-sharing, the USFK faced financial difficulties, including
insufficient funds for the labor costs of Korean employees, a problem directly
related to the employment of Korean citizens.
Furthermore, with a shared view on the need to improve the current costsharing system, Korea and the U.S. held two high-level meetings in June and
October 2007, to discuss possible ways of establishing a more reasonable and
stable cost-sharing system.

4) The Relocation and Realignment of U.S. Forces in Korea

The two countries agreed on the realignment of the U.S. forces in Korea
by signing two agreements on the relocation of Yongsan Garrison and the
revised Land Partnership Plan (LPP) in October 2004. Both agreements entered
into force in December 2004 with the Korean National Assembly’s approval.
After the two agreements entered into force, at SPI consultations the two
countries reviewed the progress made in implementing the agreements and in
2007, completed all necessary preparations for the construction, such as
migration of local residents, land purchase, and selection of the Program
Management Consortium (PMC). In 2008, there will be continuous efforts for


-----

the smooth implementation of the construction process including facility
design.
By consolidating USFK bases dispersed across the country, USFK
realignment will lead to a more efficient use of land and solve many
inconveniences caused to the local residents. Furthermore, it will also increase
a more efficient management of the USFK bases and provide a comfortable
stationing environment for the USFK, thereby strengthening the combined
ROK-U.S. defense posture. Various follow-up measures will be continuously
taken to ensure the successful implementation of the relocation and
realignment of the USFK.


###### 3. Improved Implementation of the ROK-U.S. SOFA 

The Korean government has made continuous efforts to improve the
process of the ROK-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) implementation, in
order to minimize public inconveniences in hosting American forces and
provide a stable stationing environment of U.S. forces in Korea, through close
consultations and cooperation with the U.S.
On the occasion of the year-end SOFA Subcommittees’Meeting (ROK
side) chaired by MOFAT, held in November 2007, relevant government
authorities discussed the direction for improving SOFA implementation and
future tasks. With regard to the results brought forth in this meeting, it was
noted that the rate of cases in which Korea exercised criminal jurisdiction for
crimes committed by U.S. soldiers had increased, a rate that has been steadily
growing, exceeding 30% of the total number of crimes since 2006.[14)]


14) The Korean government exercises its criminal jurisdiction upon crimes falling within 12 categorized
cases of sufficient gravity in accordance with SOFA and other crimes regarded as having similar gravity.
USFK exercises its jurisdiction upon all other crimes.

The two sides have strived to cooperatively manage serious criminal cases
involving U.S. soldiers, and have discussed preventive measures against such cases
through close consultations. The USFK has endeavored in recent years to develop
policies and programs, and enhanced U.S. soldiers’understanding of Korean culture
aiming to prevent crimes, and crime rates have actually shown continuous decrease.
With regard to labor issues, both sides have been working hard in close
consultation with each other to enhance the fair rights and interests of USFK Korean
employees, by dealing with pending issues on the application of Korea’s i) Industrial
Accidents Compensation Insurance (IACI); ii) Long-Term Care Insurance (LTCI); and
iii) Employment Insurance Plan (EIP) to Korean Employees of USFK. Also, the two
sides have made efforts to improve the implementation of SOFA by harmonizing the
existing Korean Service Corps (KSC) agreement with up-to-dated Korean labor laws.
Specifically, the Labor Subcommittee, which is composed of the two sides,
developed measures to enable the equal application of the ROK-U.S. SOFA
operating procedures for resolving individual cases and collective labor disputes to
the Korean employees under the KSC agreement, as it is applied to the USFK Korean
employees under SOFA.
As for the Cultural Properties Protection (CPP), notwithstanding the short
operational period since its establishment in July 2005, the CPP Subcommittee has
brought about meaningful results in providing the grounds for taking over Korean
cultural properties and reinforcing their protection within the USFK installations by
developing the 「Procedures for Field Survey of Cultural Properties within USFK
Facilities and Areas」, which was agreed upon by Korea and the U.S. in December
2005.

In addition, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Subcommittee has
established a footing for securing the safety of animal and plant products brought
into Korea by USFK, by concluding the 「Memorandum of Agreement Concerning
Joint Inspection of Plants and Plant Products」(April 2006) and the「Memorandum of
Agreement Concerning Quarantine and Inspection of Animal Products」(October
2006). The Korean government will make continued efforts to improve the overall
implementation of SOFA, through close communication among related government
authorities and reinforcement of cooperative systems.
As for environmental issues, the government has made intense consultations
with the U.S. to reflect the interests of Korean citizens regarding the environmental
protection issue of USFK facilities and adjacent areas. In line with plans for the return
of USFK bases according to the Yongsan Relocation Plan (YRP) and the Land
Partnership Plan (LPP) concluded between the two sides, Korea and the U.S. have
been negotiating, since June 2005, over the remediation level of returning bases,
especially of those that have completed joint environmental surveys.
Against this backdrop, during the hearings held in June 2007, the National
Assembly pointed out problems in managing the return of 23 bases and further
suggested possible measures to improve the situation. The Korean government,
taking that into account, plans to make efforts for the smooth return of the remaining
bases through close consultations with the U.S.
The Korean government will continue to cooperate closely with the U.S. to
make sure that the SOFA is fully implemented according to its revised and improved
contents. In particular, the government plans to minimize public inconvenience in
order to meet the public’s expectations regarding SOFA and create a stable stationing
environment for U.S. forces through continued efforts in improving the SOFA
implementation.

###### Chapter 3 Relations with Neighboring Countries

 1. Korea-Japan Relations

Despite the continued tensions over issues stemming from history since
2005, there were expectations of a cordial atmosphere for Korea-Japan relations
due to Japan’s promotion of Asian Diplomacy pursued by the Fukuda
administration in the second half of 2007. In particular, on November 20,
2007, President Roh Moo-hyun and newly inaugurated Prime Minister Yasuo
Fukuda held an Korea-Japan Summit on the occasion of the ASEAN+3 Summit
in Singapore. Furthermore, the seven rounds of bilateral Foreign Ministers’
Meetings and many working-level contacts have contributed to efforts for the
improvement of Korea-Japan relations.
However, the statement by the former Prime Minister Abe denying that
comfort women were coerced into sexual slavery, some Japanese leaders’
careless statements reflecting distorted perceptions of history, the
commemoration of “Takeshima (Dokdo) Day (22[th] February)”by the Shimane
Prefecture on February 24, and the Japanese government’s approval of
distorted high school history textbooks on March 30 have strained Korea-Japan
relations. In response, on such occasions as the March First Independence
Movement Day’s speech by the President, the bilateral Foreign Ministers’
Meeting held on March 31, and the five statements by the MOFAT
Spokesperson, the Korean government has continued to call for the Japanese
government to take responsible action, emphasizing the importance of an
accurate recognition of history on the part of the Japanese political leaders’
with respect to historical truth, in building future-oriented Korea-Japan relations.
As for people-to-people and economic exchanges between the two
countries, the number of people engaging in exchanges and trade volume


-----

increased from 4.46 million and $78.5 billion in 2006 to 4.84 million people
and $82.6 billion respectively in 2007. In the cultural field, the Korean
government has fostered even more mature relations by supporting exchanges
between the peoples of the two countries, for example, with the Shitennoju
Wasso Festival on November 4, 2007.
Moreover, the efforts by the two governments to address particular issues
relating to history proved highly fruitful in 2007. A total of 611 Sakhalin Koreans
returned from Sakhalin Island between September 28 and December 1. The
return was realized as a part of the repatriation of Sakhalin Koreans which has
been carried out since 1990 as part of efforts to achieve a fundamental
resolution of the Sakhalin Korean issue. Another round of returns of Sakhalin
Koreans to take up permanent residence is being prepared in 2008 and 2009.
Moreover, the receipt of the copies of the deposit money list of military soldiers
and civilians attached to the Imperial Japanese Army (a total of 110,000 people,
equivalent to 91 million yen) opened the way for compensation for those
concerned. The return of the remains of people forced to move to Japan during
the colonial period, agreed upon at the bilateral summit on the occasion of the
ASEAN+3 Summit, was carried out with the return of the remains of 101 people
on January 23, 2008 which had been laid in Yutenji Temple in Tokyo.
It may be said that an accurate understanding of the past is necessary for
a future-oriented relationship between ROK and Japan. In recognition of this,
the second phase of Korea-Japan Joint History Research launched in June 2007,
and the Steering Committee on June 22 and two Plenary Sessions have been
held: the first in Tokyo on June 23 and the second in Seoul on November
23-24.

High Level Exchanges between Korea and Japan in 2007


-----

diplomatic relations, as the “Year of Korea-China Exchanges.”Furthermore,
under the slogan of “Let’s open a bright future for Korea-China relations,”the
two countries held a variety of events in a whole range of fields spanning the
political, economic, social and cultural areas, including Opening and Closing
ceremonies attended by the Prime Ministers of each country. In addition, the
Heads of State, Prime Ministers, and Foreign Ministers of the two countries
exchanged letters of congratulation on the 15[th] anniversary of the establishment
of diplomatic ties. With these various activities throughout 2007, thriving
cooperation was fostered between Korea and China.
The Korean government has exerted continued efforts to develop the
bilateral ties in the political, diplomatic, economic and cultural fields to deepen
and develop the “Comprehensive and Cooperative Partnership”as agreed
upon at the Korea-China Summit in 2003.
First, President Roh had a meeting with Prime Minster Wen Jiabao on the
occasion of the ASEAN+3 Summit held in January in Cebu, the Philippines,
where the two Leaders agreed on expanding exchanges and cooperation
between Korea and China in a whole spectrum of fields. Moreover, the two
countries also agreed, as well as maintaining close cooperation at the regional
and international level, to actively cooperate to ensure the success of the “Year
of Korea-China Exchanges.”In addition, the two sides discussed major pending
issues in the summit on the occasion of Prime Minister Wen Jiabao’s visit to
Korea in April 2007, the summit meeting with President Hu Jintao on the
occasion of the APEC Economic Leaders’Meeting in Sydney, Australia in
September and meeting with Prime Minister Wen Jiabao on the sidelines of the
ASEAN+3 Summit in Singapore in November.
With a view to deepening and expanding the bilateral exchanges, Korea
and China have also pursued increased parliamentary exchanges between the
two countries. Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of China’s National
People’s Congress (NPC) Guxiulian visited Korea on the occasion of the
participation in the 4[th] Korea-China Women Leaders’Forum in June, and met
with President Roh and the Vice Speaker of the National Assembly when they


-----

discussed and exchanged views on matters of common interest including
parliamentary exchanges and exchanges between female leaders. Then in July
the Speaker of the National Assembly Lim Chae-jung visited China, and
exchanged views on strengthening Korea-China exchanges and cooperation,
and measures to achieve a peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear
issue with Prime Minister Wen Jiabao and Chairman of the NPC Standing
Committee Wubangguo.
Furthermore, the authorities of Korea and China have strengthened
consultations in the diplomatic field on diplomatic and security issues through
discussions on pending issues such as the North Korean nuclear issue and
developing the partnership between the two countries. The two sides have
held Foreign Ministers’Talks on the occasion of Foreign Minister Song Minsoon’s visit to China in January, as well as bilateral Korea-China Foreign
Ministers’Talks on the occasion of a wide range of international conferences
such as the ASEM Foreign Ministers’Meeting, the ARF, APEC, the UN General
Assembly, and the ASEAN+3 Summit Talks.
In the field of economic exchanges, in 2007 the total volume of bilateral
trade between the two countries reached $145 billion, which represents a 22.9%
year-on-year increase from the volume in 2006. As of 2007, China was Korea’s
No.1 trading partner, creating a trade surplus for Korea, and also a target for
investment, while Korea also established itself as the third largest trading partner
for China. Furthermore, the people-to-people exchanges between the two
countries have continuously grown to reach a total of 5.85 million people
engaging in exchanges between the two countries, representing a 44-fold increase
compared to 130,000 at the time of the establishment of diplomatic relations.
There are about 830 flights between six cities in Korea and thirty cities in China.
On the other hand, the results of public opinion polls on anti-Korean
sentiment and critical articles about Korea being released in a distorted manner
by some Chinese media, some anti-Korean sentiment has been witnessed in
China. In response, the Korean government has been exerting efforts to
prevent the spread of anti-Korean sentiment through active public relations and
requests for the correction of media reports and inaccurate Internet websites.

###### 3. Korea-Russia Relations

Remarkable progress has been made in Korea-Russia relations in the
seventeen years since diplomatic relations were established in 1990. In
particular, since the upgrading of the bilateral relations into a “Mutually Trustful
and Comprehensive Partnership”during President Roh Moo-hyun’s visit to
Russia in September 2004, Korea and Russia have been forging still stronger ties
of cooperation in a whole range of spheres including the political, economic,
energy and aerospace fields.
Based on the common interest in peace and stability on the Korean
Peninsula, the two countries have been holding summits and high-level
meetings to cooperate closely for stability and prosperity in Northeast Asia. In
2007, there were four rounds of Korea-Russia Foreign Ministerial Talks, at
which they discussed measures to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue such
as those relating to North Koreans’frozen accounts in BDA and the provision
of energy to North Korea, and agreed to cooperate in the future in addressing
regional security threats such as nuclear proliferation.
As for economic exchanges, the bilateral trade in 2007 reached $15
billion, representing a 50% increase from that in 2006, and Koreans invested
$925 million in Russia last year, constituting an upward trend.
The cooperation between the two nations is expanding to a range of
areas including aerospace technology, IT, and farming. The first Korean
astronaut made a successful space flight on the Russian spaceship “Soyuz”in
April 2008. In addition, a jointly developed Korea Space Launch Vehicle (KSLV-1)
is scheduled to be launched at the Naro Space Center in Goheung in December
2008. The recent advance by Korean farming companies into Primorsky Krai is


-----

expected to be of great use in addressing the food crisis resulting from surging
grain prices.
Korea and Russia are actively exploring ways to cooperate in the Russian
Far East and Siberia. Russia is planning to spend 566 billion rubles (or $23.8
billion) to develop the Russian Far East and Siberia from 2008 to 2013, in which
Russia hopes to cooperate with Korea. Korea holds keen interest in investing in
the resource-rich region. The two countries will continue bilateral consultations
on building infrastructure for the 2012 Vladivostok Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) Summit, developing oil and gas fields, and promoting
tripartite cooperation among the ROK, the DPRK and Russia including the TSRTKR Project, which aims to connect the Trans-Korean Railway (TKR) with the
Trans-Siberian Railway (TSR).


###### 4. Cooperation among Korea, China and Japan

In 2007 great progress was made in the institutionalization of cooperation
among the ROK, China and Japan.
There has been an evident trend of a sharp rise every year in the trilateral
economic and people-to-people exchanges. Furthermore, with the pending
common security issues such as the North Korean nuclear issue and a
considerable number of transnational concerns such as energy and the
environment, close trilateral cooperation and collaboration are essential.
Nonetheless, the reality is that the ROK, China and Japan have not yet been
able to establish an order for institutional cooperation as the EU and ASEAN.
However, in 2007 a variety of consultative bodies were in operation
between the three governments including the Trilateral Summit and Foreign
Ministers’Meeting. In particular, significant measures were taken for
institutionalizing trilateral cooperation.
Primarily, the 7[th] and 8[th] Trilateral Summits were held in Cebu, the
Philippines in January 2007 and in Singapore in November 2007 respectively.


-----

On the occasion of these two summits, the three leaders discussed concrete
ways to promote cooperation among their countries and exchanged views on
major regional situations including the Korean Peninsula.
Of particular note is the First Trilateral Foreign Ministers’Meeting held on
June 3, 2007 on Jeju Island, which was highly meaningful as it was the first
meeting to be held independently from other multilateral occasions. It was held
on Korea’s initiative and upon the agreement reached by the three Leaders at
the 7[th] Trilateral Summit in Cebu.


Foreign Ministers’Meeting: Korea, Japan, and China (Jeju Island, June 3, 2007)


The three Ministers agreed to enhance substantial cooperative projects in
nine key areas including the launch of Gimpo-Shanghai/ Shanghai-Haneda
airport shuttles at an early date and the promotion of the Korea-China-Japan
Cultural Shuttle Project. In addition, they concurred on maintaining close
cooperation to achieve progress on the North Korean nuclear issue.
As in other years, the Trilateral Committee attended by the Foreign
Ministers of Korea, China and Japan was held on November 20, 2007 prior to


-----

the Trilateral Summit on the sidelines of the ASEAN+3 Summit. The Committee
conducted a final review of the 2007 Progress Report of the Trilateral
Cooperation among the ROK, China and Japan and reached decisions on the
adoption of new cooperative projects to be implemented after 2008.
The Korea-China-Japan Senior Foreign Affairs Officials’Consultation at
the deputy foreign minister level was held on two occasions: in Beijing on May
19, 2007 and in Seoul on October 28, 2007 respectively. These Consultations
were also held pursuant to the agreement reached between the three Leaders at
the 7[th] Trilateral Summit. The three Deputy Ministers for Foreign Affairs
reviewed the progress in the implementation of trilateral cooperation projects in
the fields of economy and trade, energy, the environment and aviation, and
cultural and people-to-people exchanges, and discussed the future direction for
these projects for cooperation. In addition, they exchanged views on major
issues on the Korean Peninsula including the North Korean nuclear issue and
the 2007 South-North Korean Summit.

###### Chapter 4 Peace Building on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia

 1. Promoting South-North Cooperation


1) Drawing International Support

The Republic of Korea has strived to improve inter-Korean relations as
well as to advance the Six-Party Talks for resolving the North Korean nuclear
issue. The Korean government continued to explain its policy towards North
Korea and the progress of inter-Korean economic cooperation not only at
multilateral meetings such as the 62[nd] session of the UN General Assembly and
ASEAN+3/EAS Summit but also at a number of bilateral meetings to secure
understanding and support of the international community.
South and North Korea held an inter-Korean summit on October 2-4,
2007 and adopted the �Declaration for Development of Inter-Korean Relations
and Peace and Prosperity�. These have led to the opening of channels for
active dialogue. In 2007 alone, a total of approximately fifty dialogue sessions
were held, including the 1[st] South-North prime minister level talks on
November 14-16, the 2[nd] Defense Minister talks on November 27-29 and the
South-North Joint Economic Cooperation Committee on December 4-6.
The Korean government has pursued inter-Korean economic cooperation
with a focus on three major projects: the Gaeseong Industrial Complex
Project,[15)] Mt. Geumgang tourism Project,[16)] and the Roadways and Railroad


15) Inaugurated on June 30, 2003, the Gaeseong Industrial Complex Project is an inter-Korean economic
cooperation project implemented at the civilian level, combining South Korean capital and technology
with North Korean labor and land. Since the first product was made in December 2004, the Complex
achieved a total output worth of $100 million in January 2007 and as of February 2008, approximately
24,000 North Korean laborers are working at 69 companies located in the Complex producing items
such as fabrics, apparel, products, bags, shoes, and electric/electronic components.
16) The Mt. Geumgang tourism project has expanded with more regular tourist roadways and tourist
courses.


-----

Connection Project.[17)] In 2007, the Korean government has endeavored to
ensure international support especially for the Gaeseong Industrial Complex
Project. For this, Korea has made efforts to explain and promote the current¨
status of the project and the positive effect it has on inter-Korean relations and
the political situation on the Korean Peninsula at various international
conferences and bilateral meetings. In order to secure the support and
understanding of the international community regarding the Gaeseong project,
Korea has also assisted the visits of foreign officials to Gaeseong such as former
U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry, Hungarian Foreign Minister Kinga
Goncz, Singapore Foreign Minister George Yeo, California assemblyman Van Tran.¨


17) The first trial operation of two cross-border rail lines - the Gyeongui and Donghae Lines - on May 17,
2007 was the first operation of a train through the Demilitarized Zone in half a century since the division
of the Korean Peninsula.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|


2) Humanitarian Assistance to North Korea

Korea has been participating in humanitarian assistance projects for North
Korea and has provided necessary diplomatic support to North Korea
assistance projects instituted by the international community.
Since the mid-1990s, Korea has been participating in various yearly
projects introduced by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) in the areas of health, nutrition, the
environment and education for women, infants and children. In 2007, Korea


-----

contributed $9.38 million to the WHO and $3.15 million to UNICEF. In
addition, Korea contributed $530,000 to International Vaccine Institute (IVI) for
a vaccine program in North Korea and participated in the North Korean
workers’training project instituted by the UN Economic and Social Commission
for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP).[18)]

Furthermore, while assisting North Korea through direct rice loans on a
bilateral basis, Korea has supplied food aid to North Korea through the World
Food Program (WFP) since 1995 when North Korea requested emergency UN
assistance. In 2007, Korea donated approximately $20 million to the WFP’s
North Korean program.
In 2007, Korea supplied 300,000 tons of fertilizer and 400,000 tons of rice
loans as humanitarian assistance. In August 2007 when North Korea was
affected by heavy floods, Korea undertook relief assistance including sending
equipment for reconstruction. Additionally, in cooperation with the UN Office
for the Cooperation of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and WFP, Korea appealed
for attention and support from the international community toward the disaster
relief effort.

3) Issue of North Korean Asylum Seekers

In the spirit of brotherhood and humanitarianism, the Korean government
accepts North Korean asylum seekers who, by free will, wish to resettle in
South Korea, and makes strenuous efforts to prevent forced repatriation to
North Korea against their will. Under the Law on Protection and Resettlement
Assistance of the North Korean Defectors, the government has made great
efforts in bringing North Korean defectors to Korea safely by requesting the
help and protection of foreign embassies through negotiations, and has sought


18) The program aims to provide North Korean officials and experts an opportunity for exchange with
member countries of UNESCAP, as well as enhance technological capability through 20 projects in four
fields such as energy, environment, transportation and regional cooperation.


-----

close cooperation with international organizations such as the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The yearly flow of North Korean
asylum seekers to South Korea has increased every year since the mid-1990s,
reaching more than 2,500 in 2007. Accordingly, 12,274 North Korean asylum
seekers have resettled in South Korea as of the end of 2007.

Yearly Flow of North Korean Defectors to South Korea

In order to ensure the psychological and physical well-being of the North
Korean asylum seekers in foreign countries while they await exit permits to
South Korea, the Korean government endeavors to provide the best possible
welfare services, including provision of pre-adaptation education and necessary
literature. Moreover, the Korean government provides various assistance
programs after the refugee’s arrival in South Korea, such as resettlement funds,
housing services, social adaptation education and employment education.
At the same time, in cooperation with the international community, the
Korean government is continuing its efforts to improve North Korean living
standards, for example, by alleviating food shortages, which has been one of
the main causes for the increase of North Korean asylum seekers.

###### 2. Multilateral Security Cooperation in Northeast Asia 

1) Northeast Asia Peace and Security Mechanism Working Group

As mentioned above, the Northeast Asia Peace and Security Mechanism
Working Group was established under the February 13 Initial Actions
Agreement, as one of the five Working Groups under the Six-Party Talks.
Chaired by the Russian Federation, the Working Group is the first intergovernmental dialogue in Northeast Asia that aims to create a multilateral
security cooperation mechanism. Northeast Asia has yet to see such multilateral
cooperation in the security field.
In 2007, the Northeast Asia Peace and Security Mechanism Working
Group had two rounds of meetings. The first round took place in the Russian
Embassy to China on March 16. During the meeting, the participating parties
had a common understanding on the need to establish a multilateral security
cooperation mechanism in the long term. The second round was held in
Moscow on August 20-21. During this round, the participants came to a
common understanding that the members of the Northeast Asian region
needed to build mutual trust and jointly lay the foundations for the
establishment of a Northeast Asia Peace and Security Mechanism. The Republic
of Korea played an active role in promoting discussion in the Working Group
meetings. During the second round, Korea noted that the Working Group
should work to agree upon a set of Guiding Principles of Peace and Security in
Northeast Asia, and seek out specific confidence-building measures.


-----

2) Northeast Asia Cooperation Dialogue (NEACD)

Furthermore, Track 1.5 multilateral dialogues for Northeast Asia regional
security are also currently underway. The most prominent of the dialogues is
the Northeast Asia Cooperation Dialogue (NEACD), and the 18[th] NEACD was
held in Moscow in November 2007. Government officials and scholars from all
members of the Six-Party Talks attended this meeting and exchanged views
concerning Northeast Asia multilateral security cooperation in the Six-Party
Talks and the regional security environment.

 1. Expanding the Diplomatic Area

In consideration of Korea’s international standing and expansion of
Korean nationals’activities overseas, the Korean government has been pursuing
multi-dimensional diplomacy in order to enlarge its diplomatic arena and its
scope of international cooperation. In this context, the Korean government
continued in 2007 to vigorously engage in summit diplomacy at bilateral,
regional, and global levels.
In 2007, the Korean government conducted summit diplomacy in a
variety of ways, such as visits made abroad by President Roh Moo-hyun and
the Prime Minister including the President’s round trip to three Middle Eastern
countries, and visits made to Korea by their foreign counterparts, including
Azerbaijani and Mongolia presidents. Meanwhile, the Korean government
pursued summit diplomacy on the sidelines of multilateral meetings including
ASEAN + 3, East Asia Summit (EAS) and APEC. As a result, in 2007 alone, the
Korean government held bilateral summit meetings with 20 countries including
six Presidential visits overseas and seven receptions held for foreign summit
visits to Korea.

2) Diplomacy for Regional Cooperation

North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)

Since the end of the Cold War, NATO is making efforts to fundamentally
transform its existing policy and conventional structure to effectively respond to
the transnational threats such as the proliferation of WMDs, international
terrorism as well as to be heedful to the changes in Europe’s political and
security environments. In addition, NATO is expanding its role and scope of
activity in the international community as can be evinced in its engagement
with the Afghanistan ISAF (International Security Assistance Force).
The Korean government is fully aware of the significant need for a sincere
and steadfast co-operation with the regional security mechanisms such as
NATO in order to effectively respond to the global security threats. As a
consequence, Foreign Minister Ban, on the invitation by NATO SecretaryGeneral Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, became the first Korean high-ranking official to
make an official visit to the NATO headquarters in Brussels. He attended the
North Atlantic Council (NAC), NATO’s highest decision-making body, on
December 2, 2005 and delivered a speech to the ambassadors of the twenty-six
NATO member states. On September 19 of the following year, Foreign Minister
Ban met with NATO Secretary-General Scheffer on the sidelines of the UN
General Assembly and shared his views on the current security issues, paving
the way for the security co-operation.
Meanwhile, NATO established a principle for expansion of co-operation
with the non-member states at the Riga Summit Conference in November, 2006,
and designated the Republic of Korea, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, as
the Contact Countries of Cooperative Objectives. This provided a turning point
in the security relations with NATO and as a result, the Korean government is
currently reviewing concrete co-operative measures.

15[th] APEC Economic Leaders’Meeting

The leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) gathered in
Sydney, Australia on September 8-9, 2007 for the 15[th] APEC Economic Leaders’
Meeting (AELM). Under the theme of “Strengthening Our Community, Building
a Sustainable Future,”the leaders addressed climate change, energy security
and clean development, the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations,
regional economic integration, structural reform, human security, APEC
membership and APEC reform. As a result of the discussions, the leaders issued
the 2007 Leaders’Declaration.
The leaders also adopted the �Sydney APEC Leaders’Declaration on
Climate Change, Energy Security and Clean Development�. This declaration,
based on the principles of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change,
presented new directions underpinning a sustainable and effective international

-----

climate change arrangement after 2012, when the first commitment period of
the Kyoto Protocol will end. The declaration conveyed a strong message to the
UN Climate Change Conference, which was held in Bali in December 2007,
calling for an early establishment of a Post-2012 regime.
Issuing the stand-alone �Statement on the WTO Negotiations�, the leaders
reaffirmed their determination to bring the DDA negotiations to a successful
conclusion. By doing so, they urged flexibility of WTO member economies so
as to bring about ambitious and balanced outcomes for the DDA.
The leaders also endorsed the Regional Economic Integration (REI)
Report, which contains agreed actions to forward the regional economic
integration of the Asia Pacific region. As part of the agreed actions, the member
economies agreed to examine the options and prospects for a Free Trade Area
of the Asia Pacific (FTAAP) and to take concrete initiatives to accelerate regional
economic integration.
APEC economies resolved to enhance their cooperation on challenges to
human security. The leaders welcomed APEC’s program to facilitate recovery of
trade disrupted by terrorist attacks and further encouraged economies to
undertake pilot projects. Further, members endorsed the Food Defense
Principles to protect the food supply against deliberate contamination.
The leaders agreed on the need to further increase productivity and
sustain strong rates of growth through structural reform. In that regard, APEC
economies decided to intensify their work program on the Leaders’Agenda to
Implement Structural Reform (LAISR) and to convene a meeting at the
ministerial level in 2008 to address structural reform priorities in the region.
Finally, by extending the moratorium on APEC membership to 2010, the
member economies agreed to put priority on the deepening rather than
widening of APEC for the next three years lest its on-going process on trade
and investment liberalization and APEC reform should be interrupted.
In the meantime, the leaders and the APEC Business Advisory Council
(ABAC) met at the APEC 2007 Business Summit held on the sidelines of the
AELM and discussed business interests including FTAAP, anti-corruption, and


-----

structural reform. At the meeting, President Roh Moo-hyun stated that, referring
to the position of Korea as a newly industrialized economy, in order to
successfully move forward APEC’s long-term goal of FTAAP, member
economies would need to seriously consider, among other things, how to
handle fundamental issues such as conflict of interests not only between
developed and developing nations, but also among developed nations. With
respect to energy security, President Roh called for renewed attention from
member economies to the importance of atomic energy.
Since APEC economies account for 67% of Korea’s trade volume and 73%
of total investment inflow, Korea’s priority is given to this region in order to
secure export markets and achieve sustainable development. In particular,
APEC serves as a forum for annual exchange among leaders from the major
countries including the United States, China, Japan, Russia, and ASEAN, thereby
assuming a positive policy role to address major issues including the betterment
of the security environment of the Korean Peninsula. In conclusion, the 2007
AELM can be assessed as one of the outstanding events highlighting APEC’s
importance in Korea’s diplomacy.

upcoming decade. As a result, the leaders adopted three statements: The
�Chairman’s Statement�, the �ASEM 6 Declaration on Climate Change�, and the

other multilateral security and economic cooperation fora. The CICA is
expected to engage member states and coordinationg countries in active
discussion on further details of the implemetation of CBMs, and to contribute
to promoting regional security and peace in Asia.

###### Chapter 2 Enhancing Korea’s Role in the International Arena

 1. Participation in UN Reform


Faced with the new and various challenges of the 21[st] century, the United
Nations reaffirmed its commitment to strengthen its system through reform and
engaged in earnest discussion on measures for cooperation at the High-level
Plenary Meeting of the 60[th] Session of the UN General Assembly in 2005.
In the institutional field, UN reform encompasses the Security Council
(UNSC) reform, Secretariat reform, the establishment of the Peacebuilding
Commission (PBC) and Human Rights Council (HRC), and revitalizing the
General Assembly.
UNSC reform includes the issues of the expansion of the size of the SC,
categories of membership, veto and improving the working methods of the SC.
In April 2007, facilitators appointed by the President of the General Assembly
submitted a report on the result of the consultations with the Members of the
UN regarding various aspects of the SC reform.
In the report, they proposed to consider a so-called “transitional/
intermediary approach”to make progress in Security Council reform. At the
conclusion of discussions on the Security Council reform during the 61[st] session
of the General Assembly, a resolution which included the element of initiating
an “inter-governmental negotiation”during the 62[nd] session of the General
Assembly was adopted in September 2007. The Republic of Korea has
maintained its principled position on the Security Council reform that such
efforts should be pursued in a way that would promote democracy,
representativeness, effectiveness and transparency of the Council with the
widest possible consensus among the Member States.
As a result of the reform efforts, the Peacebuilding Commission and


-----

Human Rights Council have been newly established. Action on development
and poverty is being discussed as they became a major issue of the 21[st] century.
Reform of the UN Secretariat is also being discussed as a matter of priority so as
to improve its capability to support the UN’s goal of fostering peace,
development and human rights.
Korea has actively participated in UN reform efforts, endeavoring to
ensure that such reforms contribute to strengthening the UN system in
responding to current challenges and threats of the 21[st] century.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has set the Secretariat reform as a major
task and presented the basic direction as follows: 1) restoring confidence in the
Secretariat and revitalizing the working culture of the Secretariat; 2) embracing
the highest ethical standards; and 3) improving and strengthening relations
between the Secretariat and the Member States. Secretary-General Ban’s “leadby-example,”in particular, has contributed to innovating the working culture of
the organization, creating an increased sense of responsibility and enhancing
transparency. As a result of Secretariat reform, the Resolution on Strengthening
the Capacity of the United Nations to Manage and Sustain Peacekeeping
Operations was adopted in the General Assembly on March 15, 2007.

###### 2. Participation in Decision-Making Processes of International Organizations

Korea was elected as a council member of the ECOSOC at the UN
General Assembly in November 2007, which was the fourth time after the first
in 1993. Furthermore, in January 2008, the Korean Permanent Representative to
the UN was elected as the vice Chair of ECOSOC, enabling Korea to take
leadership role in discussions on economic and social issues such as
development, the environment, humanitarian assistance and human rights.
Korea was also re-elected as a council member of the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO) and International Maritime Organization (IMO).


-----

Since 2001, Korea has been appointed as a council member of the ICAO three
times consecutively. After joining the IMO Council as Category (a) (10 states with
the largest interest in providing international shipping services) in 2001, Korea
has now been elected as a Council member four times consecutively. At the 34[th]

session of the UNESCO General Conference, Korea was elected as an Executive
Board member for a four-year term, our fourth appointment since 1987.
As for personal nominations, Dr. Lee Yang-hee assumed the post of the
Chair of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, Dr. Chai Lee-sik was
appointed Chairman of the Legal Committee of the International Maritime
Organization, Dr. Park Yong-ahn was elected as a member of the Commission
on the Limits of the Continental Shelf and Mr. Lee Man-ki as the member of the
Executive Council for the World Meteorological Organization. With these
appointments to major posts in international organizations, Korea has been able
to more fully participate in addressing major international issues.
Moreover, regarding high-ranking posts, Ambassador Choi Young-jin, the
former Permanent Representative to the UN, was appointed as the Special
Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Cote d’Ivoire, Dr. Choi Soonhong was appointed as the Chief Information Technology Officer (AssistantSecretary-General), and former General Assembly President Han Seung-soo
served as the UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy on Climate Change from
May 2007 to March 2008.


###### 3. Supporting Participation of Korean Nationals in International Organizations

As a means to contribute to the international community, the government
is actively supporting Korean nationals who have the necessary qualities and
qualifications to enter the secretariats of various international organizations.
To this end, the Foreign Ministry established the International
Organizations Recruitment Center in 1995. The Center implements the Junior


-----

Professional Officer (JPO) program, hosts the National Competitive Recruitment
Examination (NCRE), and operates a recruitment information homepage.
Through such programs and policies, the Ministry has worked to enhance
Korea’s participation in global issues and meet the expectations of the
international community.

###### 4. Participation in UN Peacekeeping Operations (PKO)

With United Nations Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) assuming greater
importance in the changed security environment of the 21[st] century, as the 10[th]

largest contributor to the UN PKO budget, Korea has made efforts to more
actively participate in these activities.
Since the deployment of over 250 engineer troops (Sangroksu Unit) to
Somalia in 1993, Korea sent its troops to PKO missions in Somalia (UNOSOM II),
Angola (UNVEM II), East Timor (UNTAET), Cyprus (UNFICYP), West Sahara
(MINURSO) and Burundi (ONUB).
In 2007, Korea sent 38 military observers to PKO missions in
India/Pakistan (UNMOGIP), Georgia (UNOMIG), Liberia (UNMIL), Afghanistan
(UNAMA), Sudan (UNMIS), East Timor (UNMIT) and Nepal (UNMIN). In July,
350 infantrymen were newly deployed to Lebanon (UNIFIL). These 400 men
and women in eight PKO missions make Korea the 37[th] largest troop
contributor among the 119 contributors.
The increase of PKO participation is a reflection of the government’s will
to contribute to world peace and security, thereby enhancing its role in the
international community. In particular, the decision to deploy to UNIFIL was
made in order to play a more proactive role in bringing lasting peace in the
Middle East, a region vital to international peace and security. Korean troops in
Lebanon have been successfully fulfilling their mission, winning the support of
residents and the Lebanese government.[26)]

To provide the legal basis for the rapid and effective deployment of
PKOs, bills were introduced to the Committee on Unification, Foreign Affairs
and Trade of the National Assembly in November 2007.
The Korean government intends to pursue various measures to

Lebanon, not only provided medical services but also formed a musical band (traditional Korean
farmers’music) to give parties for the residents. The aim of “Operation Peace Wave”was to repair old
school buildings and roads.


-----

encourage PKO activities befitting Korea’s national power, including the
introduction of an institutional framework regulating the process of
participation in PKOs and greater participation in PKO-related discussions
within the UN.

###### 5. Promotion of Human Rights and the Spread of Democracy

1) Activities within the UN Human Rights Council and the UN
General Assembly

The Republic of Korea, an inaugural member of the UN Human Rights
Council (HRC) since its launch in June, 2006, has endeavored to contribute to
the process of firmly establishing the Council as a fair and effective body
functioning in a spirit of dialogue and cooperation as it responds to the
violation of human rights in the international community. In 2007, the Council
held three regular sessions and a special session on Myanmar. In particular, it is
noteworthy that on June 18, 2007, the 5[th] Session of the Human Rights Council
adopted the text on the UN Human Rights Council institution-building
including detailed procedures for the newly devised mechanism of the
Universal Periodic Review (UPR), Special Procedures, Advisory Committee of
the Human Rights Council and Complaint Procedure.

         - 362 troops          - 6 police officers


-----

Following the agreement on institution-building, the detailed modalities
for the UPR and the schedule for the review of the human rights situations of
192 UN Member States were determined in the follow-up discussions; the
review is to take place from April 2008 over the next four years. It was decided
that the human rights situation in Korea would be reviewed in May 2008 at the
second session of the Human Rights Council’s UPR Working Group. With
regard to the Special Procedures, it was agreed that the Review, Rationalization
and Improvement (RRI) of the Special Procedures Mandate-holders would be
conducted within a year and the RRI was actually conducted on a number of
special rapporteurs.
Moreover, the 62[nd] Session of the UN General Assembly began in
September 2007, and the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly, which
deals with social, humanitarian affairs and human rights issues, adopted
resolutions on the human rights situations in the Democratic People’s Republic
of Korea, Myanmar, Belarus and the Islamic Republic of Iran, maintaining the
mechanism of resolutions on human rights situations in specific countries. In
addition, resolutions on a moratorium on the use of the death penalty and on
eliminating rape and other forms of sexual violence in all their manifestations,
including sexual violence in conflict and related situations were adopted for the
first time at the UN General Assembly, which is believed to constitute
meaningful progress. Korea abstained in the draft resolution on the human
rights situation in the DPRK, in light of the unique nature of inter-Korean
relations. Regarding the draft resolutions on Myanmar, Belarus and the Islamic
Republic of Iran, the ROK voted against all No Action Motions on the draft
resolutions in accordance with the government’s basic position; it voted for the
resolutions on the human rights situations in Myanmar and Belarus respectively,
while abstaining from the resolution on the human rights situation in the
Islamic Republic of Iran, all maintaining the ROK’s established positions on
these issues.
The Korean delegation actively participated in the discussions on various
agenda items in the UN General Assembly in a variety of different ways such as


-----

by making official statements. In particular, as the issues of sexual violence
against women and organized sexual violence in conflict situations are a matter
of great concern to the Government of Korea, by actively participating in the
consultations on the draft resolution, the government ensured that its position
was appropriately reflected in the resolution on eliminating rape and other
forms of sexual violence in all their manifestations, including sexual violence in
conflict and related situations.
The Korean Government played a leading role in the process of drafting
and adopting the �Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities�. In
particular, through our continued efforts to persuade some developed
countries, Korea played a great part in the inclusion of a separate clause for
women with disabilities in the Convention. It signed the Convention on March
30, 2007.

2) Diplomatic Efforts to Promote Democracy

Korea has actively participated in the international community’s efforts to
spread universal values such as human rights as well as the spread of
democracy. Korea is one of the original members of the Convening Group of
the Community of Democracies (CD) which was first convened in June 2000 in
Warsaw, Poland. Korea hosted the 2[nd] CD Ministerial Meeting on November
10-12, 2002, and in 2006, played an active part in the Convening Group’s
meetings for the institutionalization of the CD, such as the pursuit of the
establishment of a Permanent Secretariat. Korea sent a delegation, headed by
the Deputy Minister for International Organizations and Global Affairs of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, to the 4[th] Ministerial Conference of the
Community of Democracies held in Bamako, Mali on November 11-14, 2007,
where it emphasized the need to eliminate factors which threaten democracy
such as terrorism, and underlined the importance of expanding opportunities
for education and reducing poverty for the promotion and spread democracy.


-----

In order to assist states in fragile situations, such as post-conflict nations
and emerging democracies, in building their democratic institutions and
governance capacity, the decision was made at the OECD Council in July 2007
to launch the Partnership for Democratic Governance (PDG). Korea joined the
PDG as a founding member with democracies such as the United States,
Australia, Canada, Chile, Denmark and Poland.


3) Rights of Women and Children

The ROK government has actively participated in all global endeavors to
protect and promote the rights of women and children, contributing to the
international discussions on their rights and making efforts to implement the
relevant international conventions at the domestic level.
For instance, the ROK, as a member of the Commission on the Status of
Women of the UN, participated in the 51[st] Session of the Commission from
February 26 to March 9 and joined the thematic discussions on the Elimination
of All Forms of Discrimination and Violence against the Girl Child. At this
session, the ROK was elected as a Vice-Chair of the Commission for the Asian
Group of the Member States, enabling it to make an even greater contribution
to the UN’s efforts for the protection and promotion of the rights of women.
In addition, the delegation of the ROK headed by the Minister of Gender
Equality participated in the review by the Committee on the Elimination of
Discrimination against Women of its fifth and sixth national reports. It is
believed that this review served as an opportunity to review the ROK’s current
policies on women as well as to form its future plans.
As part of the efforts to protect children’s rights, the Government of the
ROK submitted its initial national reports as required by the Optional Protocol to
the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in
Armed Conflict and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of
the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography.


-----

The ROK government, led by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, drew up a
report on the implementation of A World Fit for Children (WFFC) adopted by
the UN General Assembly Special Session on Children in May 2002, and
submitted it at the Commemorative High-level Plenary Meeting devoted to the
follow-up to the Outcome of the Special Session on Children which took place
in New York in December 2007.
Furthermore, the Government of the ROK held the 4[th] bilateral
consultation with UNICEF in Seoul on May 22, 2007. The ROK, which has
developed from a UNICEF beneficiary to a donor country, will continue to hold
bilateral consultations with UNICEF to consolidate international cooperation for
the protection of children’s rights.

4) Health

In order to contribute to the promotion of health in the international
community, the ROK has strengthened various assistance programs for
developing countries as well as improved the quality of domestic health and
medical treatment. To this end, the ROK has also strengthened its cooperation
with major international health organizations such as the WHO.
In particular, the delegation of the ROK headed by Heath and Welfare
Minister Rhyu Si-min, participated in the 60[th] World Health Assembly which
took place in Geneva, Switzerland on May 14-23, 2007, and engaged in
discussions on how to cooperate in taking measures to address current
international health issues such as prevention and control of avian influenza,
malaria and noncommunicable diseases and measures for strengthening
health information systems.
In the belief that the HIV epidemic is not just a health and social issue but
also an issue relating to international security as well as a political issue, and
that it is emerging as one of the most important national tasks for developing
countries, the ROK has participated fully in the international efforts to combat


-----

HIV/AIDS, donating three million dollars to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria in 2007 as a follow-up measure to the 2006 HighLevel Meeting on AIDS.
Considering that there are growing concerns about the possibility of the
transmission of avian influenza to human beings, the ROK, as a country that
achieved exemplary results in eradicating and preventing avian influenza, has
participated fully in the efforts to find a solution to this problem at the regional
and global levels. In particular, the ROK actively participated in the discussions
on developing a mechanism to enhance the access of developing countries to
vaccines and information on avian influenza.

###### 6. Disarmament and Non-Proliferation Activities


1) International Trends

The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their means
of delivery is posing an ever-increasing threat to international peace and
security. In particular, the possibility of terrorist groups acquiring WMD has
become grave concerns ever since the terrorist attacks of September 11 and the
subsequent revelation of the international network of nuclear black markets run
by the Pakistani scientist A.Q. Khan. In addition, it is also very alarming to see
that some are exploiting loopholes in international non-proliferation regimes in
their ways of developing nuclear weapons under the guise of peaceful uses of
nuclear energy. In response, the international community has been exerting
efforts to strengthen the international non-proliferation regime to deter the
proliferation of WMD. In addition, with the increasing awareness of the close
interrelation between disarmament and development, the international
community is intensifying its efforts to reduce human suffering resulting from
conventional weapons by reinforcing controls over conventional weapons,


-----

especially those which may be deemed to be excessively injurious or to have
indiscriminate effects. The efforts by the international community to strengthen
the international non-proliferation regime are as follows.
First, multilateral control through the existing international organizations
and arrangements has been reinforced. The International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) celebrated its 50[th] anniversary in 2007 and is seeking to expand
and strengthen its role. The IAEA is seeking to promote the universality of the
Additional Protocol which prevents the illicit use of nuclear materials, while
strengthening its safeguards system for nuclear facilities and materials. As of
December 2007, 116 countries have signed and 86 countries ratified the
Additional Protocol. In addition, the multilateral export control regime has
strengthened its mechanisms to effectively deal with new challenges, such as
Intangible Technology Transfer (ITT) through electronic means and the
proliferation of WMD through transshipment, transit and brokering.
Second, policy coordination among like-minded countries sharing similar
policy frameworks has been strengthened. The G-8 Global Partnership was
launched in 2002 and was implemented by the voluntary contributions from
G-8 countries and other donors including Korea in order to destroy chemical
weapons, dismantle decommissioned nuclear submarines, and dispose of fissile
materials, initially in Russia. The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) was
subsequently introduced in 2003 to interdict shipments of WMD and its related
items likely to be destined to possible nonproliferation perpetrators. In
February 2006, the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) was launched to
seek measures to reprocess spent nuclear fuel while also to minimize nuclear
proliferation threats. The U.S. launched the Secure Freight Initiative (SFI) in
2006 to safeguard global maritime security by scanning U.S. bound containers
for nuclear and radioactive materials in overseas ports. In doing so,
participating countries have deepened mutual understandings and heightened
controls over WMD-related materials.
Third, new norms for the non-proliferation of WMD have emerged and
have been spreading. In April 2004, the UN Security Council adopted


-----

Resolution 1540 prohibiting its members from supporting non-state actors’
development, acquisition, and transfer of WMD. In October 2005, a revised
Protocol to the 1988 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against
the Safety of Maritime Navigation (SUA Convention) was adopted in the
International Maritime Organization (IMO), which has strengthened the legal
framework for control over the illicit transfer of WMD and WMD-related
materials at sea. In addition, the International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO) is pursuing the amendment of the 1971 Montreal Convention for a
similar purpose of the SUA Convention.
Fourth, global initiatives to strengthen controls over conventional
weapons have been maintained and expanded. In particular, greater attention
has been made on the problem associated with small arms and light weapons
given that uncontrolled proliferation of small arms and light weapons pose a
serious threat to the lives and safety of civilians and hinder social and economic
development in post-conflict regions and in developing countries. The United
Nations has called for international cooperation to prevent the illicit trade of
small arms and light weapons with the adoption of the UN Programme of
Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and
Light Weapons in All Its Aspects (PoA) in 2001 and the International Instrument
to Enable States to Identify and Trace, in a Timely and Reliable Manner, Illicit
Small Arms and Light Weapons in 2005.
Finally, there have been more active discussions recently on the use of
cluster munitions which can cause severe harm to civilians in post-conflict
regions. The international community commenced negotiations on cluster
munitions in 2007 and the negotiations are being conducted in two separate
tracks, often referred to as ‘the Oslo Process’and ‘the Convention on Certain
Conventional Weapons (CCW) Process.’In the Oslo Process, the discussions
are focused on concluding a legally binding instrument by 2008 that will ban
the use of cluster munitions. In the CCW Process, states are discussing ways to
minimize harm to civilians arising out of the use of cluster munitions while duly
considering the concern over national security and military necessity.

2) Government Activities

The ROK government recognizes WMD proliferation as a direct threat to
international and national security and, as a member of the major agreements
on disarmament and non-proliferation as well as multilateral export control
arrangements, actively participates in the international efforts for nonproliferation of WMD. Its major activities in the framework for multilateral
cooperation are as follows.

-----

First, the ROK government became an official member of the Global
Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) in December 2007 and is participating in
the global efforts for nuclear non-proliferation, and is establishing a foundation
for the development of new proliferation-resistant recycling technologies in
order to produce more energies, reduce waste and minimize proliferation
concerns in response to ever-increasing demand for nuclear energy in the near
future.
Second, the ROK government joined the G-8 Global Partnership (G-8 GP)
in June 2004 and continues to make financial contributions to this program. In
2007, the ROK government contributed $1 million for four programs, including
the Japanese-Russian Program to dismantle decommissioned Russian nuclear
submarines and the program to provide alternative energy following the
shutdown of the obsolete nuclear reactor in Zheleznogorsk, Russia. The ROK’s
participation in the G-8 GP programs has enabled us to accumulate valuable
experiences in various dismantlement programs, thereby strengthening our
capacity-building in the area of combating WMD terrorism.
Third, the ROK government officially joined the Global Initiative to
Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) in May 2007. The GICNT was announced
at the G-8 Summit held in July 2006 as a joint initiative by the U.S. and Russia.
The GICNT aims to improve physical protection of nuclear materials, detect and
suppress illicit trafficking in nuclear materials, prevent the acquisition of nuclear
materials by terrorists, and promote information sharing. As of June 2008,
73 countries have joined the GICNT. The IAEA and the EU are also participating
in the GICNT as observers. It is expected that, through participation in the
GICNT, Korea will be able to enhance its capability to protect nuclear materials
and facilities and enhance our international standing in this field. In addition, it
will provide an opportunity for Korea to closely cooperate and share
information with such countries as the United States, Russia and China.
Fourth, the ROK government decided in December 2006 to participate in
the Secure Freight Initiative (SFI) pilot program at the Hutchison Gamman
Container Terminal in Busan. The installation of radiation detection equipment


-----

and non-intrusive imaging equipment are scheduled to be completed in 2008.
The preparations for the SFI pilot program are in their final stages as of April
2008. The Korean government’s participation in the SFI will contribute to the
strengthening of international efforts for WMD non-proliferation and, as a
result, the Port Busan is expected in this way to enhance its global reputation as
a nuclear-free port. Concerning the PSI, the ROK government supports the
purpose and spirits of the PSI. Taking into account the unique circumstances
on the Korean Peninsula, the ROK is participating in the PSI activities in a
limited way such as by sending observers to the PSI interdiction exercises.
Finally, Korea co-hosted with Australia an International Seminar on
Brokering Controls in Seoul in March 2007 and the 6[th] ROK-UN Joint
Conference on Disarmament and Nonproliferation Issues in Seoul in December
2007. Furthermore, the Korean government participated in the UN Group of
Governmental Experts on Missiles and assumed the chairmanship of the UN
Secretary-General’s Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters. The ROK
government has, in this manner, contributed to the global efforts for
disarmament and non-proliferation, actively participating in the UN’s
multilateral disarmament and non-proliferation activities and thereby enhancing
its national status in the field.

###### 7. International Cooperation Against Terrorism

1) Trends in International Terrorism

Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 which brought
about fundamental changes in international security environment, the
international community has achieved progress in dismantling major terrorist
bases, disrupting terrorist financing, and tightening border controls through
the strengthening of cooperation. However, terrorist organizations still continue


-----

to expand their scope of influence by updating their methods and structures,
utilizing various high-tech communication systems including the Internet and
engaging in transnational crimes such as kidnapping, human trafficking and
illegal drug and weapons trade.
In particular, the spread of home-grown terrorism, a phenomenon arising
from the infiltration of terrorist ideologies in under-represented groups,
indicates the active recruitment of terrorists through propaganda by major
terrorist groups. Such a phenomenon reflects the need for a thorough
understanding of social and cultural factors affecting terrorism.
In this vein, there is a general understanding that in order to effectively
address terrorism, countries need to enhance counter-terrorism capacity
through a comprehensive international cooperation. This can be achieved by
the exchange of information, the collaboration among law enforcement
authorities and the fostering of mutual understanding. Moreover, joint efforts to
fight poverty and social polarization are also necessary to remove the breeding
ground for terrorism.


2) International Counter-Terrorism Cooperation

(1) Basic Direction of International Counter-Terrorism


The Republic of Korea firmly believes that there is no possible justification
for any acts of terrorism, which is an inhuman crime affronting human dignity.
The ROK will not compromise or yield to any threats of terrorism. Firmly
committed to this principle, Korea is actively participating in the joint efforts by
the international community, such as the United Nations to dispel terrorism.
The ROK has contributed to the international cooperation for the
reconstruction and the promotion of security in key areas such as Iraq and
Afghanistan where the counter-terrorism endeavors are concentrated.
Meanwhile, along with the enforcement of existing laws, Korea is expanding its
role through an increased cooperation and the employment of “soft”approach


-----

in counter-terrorism. As part of such efforts, the government is pursuing
projects to support capacity building by disrupting terrorist financing and by
providing training in the areas of drugs, maritime security, and cyber security.
The ROK is also an active member of the Alliance of Civilizations.

(2) Korea’s Participation in International Counter-Terrorism Cooperation

In September 2006, the UN General Assembly unanimously adopted the
UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, which laid the basis for comprehensive
and globally participated counter-terrorism activities for member states and
regional organizations to implement the measures against terrorism. The ROK is
a part to the 12 Anti-terrorism Conventions and Protocols. In September 2005 at
the 60[th] Session of the UN General Assembly, it also signed the International
Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, which is currently
in the process of being ratified. Moreover, Korea is participating in the efforts to
establish international counter-terrorism norms including the efforts for the early
adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism, which
is currently under discussion in the UN General Assembly. The ROK has
submitted a series of reports regarding the implementation of terrorism-related
UN Security Council resolutions, and is actively cooperating in carrying out the
measures imposed by the UN Al-Qaeda and Taliban Sanctions Committee
including travel restrictions and financial sanctions on the individuals and
entities associated with Al-Qaeda and the Taliban.
The Republic of Korea, as the Chair of the APEC Counter Terrorism Task
Force of the APEC for 2007-2008, is playing a leading role in the pursuit of
various projects in counter-terrorism with an aim of promoting stable trade and
investments in this region.
In addition, the ROK is actively participating in the efforts in the ASEAN
Regional Forum (ARF), encompassing a wide range of issues including border
and maritime security, cyber-terrorism, information exchanges and dialogues
among religions and civilizations. In particular, the ROK takes a firm stance


-----

against the issues on cyber-terrorism. The ROK is also actively participating in
the efforts of rooting out transnational crimes by supporting the projects of drug
eradication in the ASEAN region.

(3) Bilateral Cooperation


The Republic of Korea currently holds consultative meetings with 20
countries and international organizations from various regions for the exchange
of information and expertise, engaging in discussions on measures for counterterrorism capacity building and technical support, and for cooperation in the
event of a terrorist incident.


3) Strengthening the Domestic System for Countermeasures

With 13 million Koreans traveling overseas annually, the increasing
number of Korean businesses expanding abroad, and the Korean troops
dispatched to foreign countries, the ROK is no longer free from the threat of
terrorism. In response to recent incidents of the kidnappings of Korean citizens
in areas of political instability such as Afghanistan and Somalia, the government
is exerting efforts to ensure measures to prevent further damages by terrorism.
Currently, the government is strengthening cooperation with the antiterrorism authorities in the countries concerned, while increasing protection for
Korean businesses and institutions in the regions regarded as vulnerable to
terrorism. Similarly, in an effort to protect Korean nationals abroad against the
increased danger of global terrorism, the amendment of the Enforcement
Decree of the Passport Act came into effect in July 2007. This amendment
provides protection by enforcing regulations and ordinances to temporarily
restrict or ban visits and stays by Korean citizens to the countries or regions in
danger of riots, terrorism and natural disasters.
In a similar manner, the ROK Government has come up with a concrete


-----

counter plan in case of supranational terrorism and preventive measures for the
protection of Korean nationals abroad in areas deemed to be in danger of
terrorism or a breakdown of public order. The ROK amended its National AntiTerror Action Directive (Presidential Decree No.47) in March 2005 and
implemented a government-wide system against terrorism with the
establishment of Council for counter-terrorism measures.

###### Chapter 3 Increasing ODA and Improving the Aid System

 1. ODA Trend in the International Community


With the widening socioeconomic gap between developed and
developing countries, the international society established the United Nations
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and is collaborating efforts to
promote development cooperation and respond to global challenges. As such,
the Official Development Assistance (ODA) is one of the most proactive efforts
of these movements supporting the sharing of technology, resources, and
growth experiences.
The 22 member countries of the OECD Development Assistance
Committee (DAC) provided a tentative $103.7 billion in aid in 2007, which
represents 0.28% of the members’combined gross national income (GNI). The
largest donors in 2007 were the United States, followed by Germany, France,
the United Kingdom and Japan. The only countries to exceed the United
Nations target of 0.7% of GNI were Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Norway and Sweden.


-----

-----

###### 2. Korea’s Current ODA Performance

In 2007, the Korean government disbursed a total of $670 million
(estimated figure) in ODA amounting to 0.07% of Korea’s total GNI, in order to
support the socioeconomic development of developing countries and
contribute to the international society’s efforts in achieving the MDGs.
Specifically, bilateral aid amounted to approximately $462 million (68.8%),
multilateral aid through international organizations recorded $296 million
(31.1%) and grants from bilateral aid totaled $329 million (71.4%), while
concessional lending added up to $132 million (28.6%).
In 2007, Korea’s ODA increased 47.6% compared with $455 million in
2006, and grants disbursed by the Korea International Cooperation Agency
(KOICA) rose 39.5%. Although there has been a steady increase in the total
volume of Korea’s ODA, the ratio of grant aid to total bilateral aid is only 71.4%,
which is insufficient in comparison to the level of OECD DAC member
countries that provide more than 90% of grants in bilateral aid.

###### 3. Improving Korea’s ODA System

Eradicating poverty and supporting development in developing countries
are top priorities in the international society. Improving ODA systems is urgent
because there is a rising demand for Korea to increase its ODA to the level
commensurate with its economic standing, and the size of foreign aid is already
expanding. Accordingly, in 2007, the Korean government established the
Bureau for Development Cooperation within the Office of Multilateral, Global
and Legal Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MOFAT), to be
wholly responsible for implementing and administering grant aids, thereby
building a foundation to collectively and efficiently manage Korea’s foreign aid
policies. Furthermore, the Korean government is working on the legislation of
the Framework Act on ODA, in order to foster a basis in pursuing systematic
and consistent aid policies, while also securing transparent financing for ODA.
Additionally, the Korean government is taking necessary measures to join
the OECD-DAC, a group of advanced donor countries. The government
confirmed its decision to join the DAC by 2010 at the second meeting of the
Committee for International Development Cooperation held under the
presidency of the Prime Minister and further organized a working group to
prepare for membership. After the Special Peer Review overseen by the DAC in
March-September 2008, Korea is expected to submit an official application for
membership within the first half of 2009. In May 2010, Korea’s membership will
be finalized, once the existing member states unanimously agree.


-----

Furthermore, Korea hosted the
International ODA Conference on
March 7, 2007 in Seoul to enhance
Korea’s ODA and simultaneously assist
citizen-participatory development.
Both domestic and international
ODA experts including Dr. Jeffrey
D. Sachs, Special Advisor on the UN
MDGs to the UN Secretary-General,
were invited to collect opinions
encompassing diverse fields.


The International ODA Conference
(Seoul, March 7, 2007)


“ODA Korea”(Korea’s official
ODA website) was launched on
October 1, 2007 to present government
policy directions, raise internal and
external support, and promote the
public’s understanding of ODA.
Providing both Korean and English
services, the website introduces Korea’s

Frontpage of ODA Korea Website contribution to the international society
(www.odakorea.go.kr) and is part of the effort to satisfy an

increasing demand for information concerning ODA and expanding active
participation from the public.
Likewise, as new donor countries and organizations such as the BRICs
(Brazil, Russia, India, China) and the global funding initiatives rapidly emerge,
the Korean government is endeavoring to strengthen cooperation with diverse
donor countries and organizations to increase the efficient use of aid resources
from these countries. As such, the Korean government co-hosted the OECD
Non-DAC Policy Dialogue Meeting on September 5-6, 2007, where both the


-----

OECD-DAC and non-DAC donor countries were represented.
As part of Korea’s efforts to participate in the international efforts in
mobilizing development resources to support the eradication of poverty and
diseases in developing countries, the Korean government introduced the
Global Poverty Eradication Contribution, namely the air-ticket solidarity levy in
September 2007. The air-ticket solidarity levy is an initiative that intends to
secure a stable source of additional financial resources for development by
imposing a small amount of contribution to each international airline-ticket
from which the proceeds will be used to help reduce diseases in African
countries. This initiative has been or will be introduced in 31 countries
including France and Chile. With the introduction of the Global Poverty
Eradication Contribution, Korea will also continue to join international
endeavors in establishing more predictable and stable financing mechanisms
for development[27)] which will in turn help the international community achieve
the MDGs.
The Global Poverty Eradication Contribution will mainly be used to assist
international efforts in eradicating diseases in Africa. To this end, the
contribution will be allocated to UNITAID (the International Drug Purchase
Facility) and Korean development and humanitarian NGOs that carry out
related projects in African countries. Policies on the employment of the
Contribution will be addressed by the Contribution Management Committee,
which is composed of members from in and out of the government and
chaired by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade.


27) Innovative sources of finance for development are characterized as additional, predictable and stable in
comparison to traditional budgetary allocation measures. With the wide recognition of the deepening
gap between the MDGs and the available financing to reach them, the international community has
initiated discussions on innovative financing for development that will supplement the traditional ODA
resources. The air-ticket solidarity levy is the most representative type of innovative financing
mechanisms for development.


-----

Also, Korea has served as the
third president of the Leading Group
on Solidarity Levies to Fund
Development from March to
September 2007 and hosted the
Group’s third plenary meeting in
Seoul in September 2007. The
Leading Group, which consists of 53
countries, was established in March
2006 in order to promote and
disseminate discussions on innovative
financing for development.

###### 4. Korea’s Development Cooperation

1) Increasing Grant Aid through KOICA

The Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), a government
agency in charge of grant aid established in 1991, provided a total amount of
$269 million in grant aid to developing countries in 2007, a 40% increase from a
year earlier. While maintaining its focus on Asia, with which Korea shares close
political and economic relations, KOICA fulfilled the implementation of Korea’s
Initiative for Africa’s Development by significantly increasing aid to Africa,
which is the least developed region. By region, aid is allocated as follows: $93
million for Asia (34%), $59 million for the Middle East (22%), $49 million for
Africa (18%), $36 million for Central and South America (13%) and $7.6 million
for Central Asia (3%). Also, KOICA successfully completed the first
reconstruction assistance work for Iraq (a total of $260 million in aid between
2003-2007).
49% of the total amount of grant aid was directed to the top 10 recipient
countries, including Iraq, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Indonesia, Peru, Cambodia,
Bangladesh, Laos, Mongol and the Philippines, and over 70% was given to the
top 20 recipient countries. In order to allocate the gradually increasing budget
for grant aid more efficiently and strategically, the Korean government
designated 40 partner countries and 19 core partner countries (total 59
countries) in order to promote aid effectiveness in 2006. In addition, the
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for 19 core partner countries has been set up
based on the developmental needs of the developing countries in November
2007.


-----

2) Reconstruction Assistance to Fragile States

(1) Reconstruction of Iraq


The Korean government promised to deliver $260 million in grant aid to
Iraq between 2003 and 2007 at the Madrid Conference in 2003 and successfully
accomplished the mission in 2007. In 2007, the Korean government finished the
reconstruction project that was conducted during the period of the first
reconstruction assistance work for Iraq. Soon, the Korean government
embarked on numerous projects spending approximately $40 million. These
projects included establishing a vocational training center in Baghdad, inviting
trainees and delivering supplies while preparing for the second reconstruction
assistance work for Iraq. In addition, the Korean government contributed $15
million to the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI)
administered by the United Nations and the World Bank.
The projects mainly focused on strengthening administrative capacities,
building social infrastructure and developing human resources in the central
government and the Arbil region where Korean troops were stationed. Korea’s
assistance to Iraq is the largest ODA Korea has given to a single country.
Moreover, the Korean government has participated in the Iraq Core Group as a
key contributor since 2004, which determines the general guidelines for the
reconstruction of Iraq.
In May 2007, the International Compact with Iraq (ICI), an initiative for
the reconstruction of Iraq, was held at Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt with the
participation of 60 countries and 19 international organizations. At the
conference, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Song Min-Soon pledged a
total amount of $200 million for the reconstruction of Iraq between 2008 and
2011 (grants aid and concessional loan for $100 million each).
Furthermore, the Korean government reached an agreement with the
United States to establish a Regional Reconstruction Team (RRT) in Arbil in
order to support the reconstruction of the Kurdish region and to empower the
capacity of the local government. Launched on February 1, 2007, the RRT was
the first case where Korea implemented a reconstruction project abroad with a
third party.


-----

(2) Reconstruction of Afghanistan

The Korean government provided approximately $56 million in grant aid
to Afghanistan from 2001 to 2005. At the London Conference in January 2006,
the Korean government made an official commitment to provide a total of $20
million to support the development of human resources, public administration
and rural development in programs that would provide supplies, invite local
trainees, dispatch experts and offer vocational training.
In addition to such assistance, after the withdrawal of the Dongui and
Dasan military units, the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) was dispatched
in order to support the international community’s efforts for the reconstruction
of Afghanistan. Korea has undertaken the existing medical facilities, which
were previously run by the Dongui and Dasan units, in order to provide the
medical services to Afghans. Also, the Korean government, as a PRT activity,
plans to provide job training programs to Afghan youth through the
establishment of a job training center.
While carrying out its commitment to reconstruct Afghanistan, the Korean
government will actively participate in international forums to discuss effective
ways to assist the strenuous task of reconstruction in Afghanistan.

(3) Reconstruction of Palestine

The Korean government pledged $6 million in aid during the KoreaPalestine ministerial talks in October 2005 to support development and security
in Palestine and to contribute to achieving peace in the Middle East. Also, in
December 2007, Foreign Minister Song Min-Soon promised an additional $20
million in grant aid to Palestine between 2008 and 2010 at the Donor’s
Conference, which was held in Paris with 68 countries and 13 international
organizations participating. During 2007, in order to keep Korea’s promises,
the Korean government strived to strengthen the Palestinian government’s
administrative capacities by implementing the following projects: Establishing
an IT training center and a technical school, developing human resources and
providing supplies.


3) Korea’s Initiative for Africa’s Development

The Korean government granted a total of about $49 million to Africa in
accordance with Korea’s Initiative for Africa’s Development announced in
March 2006 and invited 721 African trainees to share Korea’s development
experiences. In particular, 20 core partner countries among the least developed
countries were identified and assistance was mainly provided to areas in which
Korea has a comparative advantage in such as healthcare, human resources
development, agriculture, fisheries and the IT industry. Furthermore, the
Korean government dedicated the Global Poverty Eradication Contribution,
which was levied on passengers boarding international flights starting from
September 30, 2007 to eradicating diseases in Africa.


-----

4) Strategic Partnerships in Multilateral Development Cooperation

In 2007, the government assisted approximately $27 million to
development programs and projects of international organizations. Breaking
away from the usual practice of providing one-time and small-sum support to a
number of international development organizations, the Korean government is
making an effort to provide strategic and systematic assistance to key partner
institutions such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and
United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) by increasing Korea’s support to
multi-year projects. Moreover, the government is holding policy dialogues on a
regular basis with partner organizations to discuss medium- and long- term
partnership strategies. To this end, the Korea-UNDP Policy Dialogue was held
in October 2007.
In addition, the government is seeking various ways to improve aid
effectiveness while striving to scale up support for international development
organizations at the same time. In December 2007, Korea became an observer
to the Multilateral Organization Performance Assessment Network (MOPAN), a
network of like-minded donor countries that jointly conduct assessments on
multilateral organizations, such as the UNDP, the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank. By participating in MOPAN, Korea aims to reflect Korea’s
position and interest in the operations of multilateral development
organizations. Korea will also endeavor to apply the assessment results in the
process of establishing future ODA plans. At the same time, Korea plans to
strengthen the monitoring and evaluation process of individual projects.
In addition, as part of an effort to strengthen international efforts to
counter global issues including HIV/AIDS and the avian influenza, the Korean
government will endeavor to devise concrete ways with the World Bank to
assist the least developed countries and establish a trust fund to this end.
Moreover, the Korean government is making endeavors to enhance its
profile as a donor in the United Nations development system by serving as a
board member of leading UN development institutions. In particular, Korea is


-----

assuming the role of the Executive Board Member of the UNDP for 2008-2010
and the UNICEF for 2006-2008.


###### 5. Humanitarian Assistance Activities

Korea will continuously seek to expand its contribution to international
efforts to address humanitarian crises due to natural and man-made disasters
and protect the basic dignity and rights of those affected by such disasters.
In addition, with the enactment of the Overseas Emergency Relief Act in
March 2007, the government has established a government-wide system that
provides prompt and effective relief in case of large-scale disasters. In line with
this Act, when a large-scale disaster occurs, an emergency relief system will
come into operation with the Public-Private Joint Committee on Overseas
Emergency Relief chaired by the Prime Minister and MOFAT overseas
emergency relief activities supervised and coordinated by MOFAT.
Furthermore, the government has offered emergency relief aid of more
than $5 million to 28 countries in 2007 to assist the victims affected by natural
disasters. In addition, Korea is increasing its contribution to the United Nations
humanitarian assistance activities by participating as a leading donor among the
Asian countries in the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), a stand-by
fund established by the United Nations to enable more timely and reliable
humanitarian assistance to those affected by natural disasters and armed
conflict.
To further its efforts in enhancing its role in the international efforts in
humanitarian assistance, Korea joined the Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Donor Support Group in October 2006. In the
following year, Korea became a member of the Humanitarian Liaison Working
Group (HLWG).


-----

###### 6. Future Challenges

Korea has transformed from a main beneficiary of international aid to an
advanced donor through rapid economic growth and democratization, setting a
good example for developing countries. By making the most of this unique
experience and state, as part of an effort to play an active role in the
international community, the government is going to make a big contribution to
incorporating emerging donor countries such as China and India and private
institutions into the international aid architecture as their influence has recently
escalated.
Also, in order to enhance the ODA system, the ratio of grant aid to ODA
will be increased, while gradual improvements will be made to the tied aid
system which restricts aid supply rights to domestic companies only. The
Korean government will actively engage in international discussions on diverse
development-related issues, and constantly strive to reflect the outcomes in
domestic policies.
In addition, by advancing the ODA system and grasping global ODA
policy trends, long term aid will be expanded to strengthen the capacity
building measures of recipient countries and promote democracy. In particular,
development aid policies such as those promoting harmony in aid will receive
positive consideration, in order to avoid overlaps in assistance given to specific
recipients and fields while increasing aid effectiveness.

###### Chapter 4 Implementing Cultural Diplomacy

 1. Overview


Today, the world is entering the era of culture based on creativity, leaving
behind the era of knowledge and information that characterized the 20[th]

century. Culture has become an essential element to a nation’s competitive
edge as a useful tool for creating added value. In 2007, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and Trade carried out a variety of activities related to cultural diplomacy
to promote national interests.
First, as the hub of culture, MOFAT has made efforts to cooperate with
Ministries and organizations related to cultural affairs and collect their resources
and capacities. Second, MOFAT has held Cultural Joint Commissions with
several countries on a bilateral basis and started the Korea-China-Japan Culture
Shuttle to gain momentum for cultural exchanges. Third, in a bid to raise
awareness of Korean culture and enhance Korea’s national image, the
government has supported a variety of activities and events such as
performances, various exhibitions in embassies and consulates abroad,
overseas screening of Korean films, and overseas Korean studies in the foreign
countries.
The Korean government has also placed policy priority on sports
diplomacy, which enabled Daegu Metropolitan City and Incheon Metropolitan
City to win the bids to host the 2014 Asian Games and 2011 World Track
Championships respectively. In addition, Korea has actively taken part in
activities related to cultural affairs within international organizations, such as
UNESCO, to promote Korea’s national image as a culturally advanced country.
The Ministry also introduced new programs such as the Mutual Cultural
Exchange Project and the Cyber Art Gallery to give Koreans better access to
cultural activities. Moreover, MOFAT has supported local governments to boost
cultural exchanges with oheir counterparts in other nations.


-----

###### 2. Enhancing the Foundation of Cultural Exchange

1) Increasing Capability for Cultural Diplomacy

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade has placed an emphasis on its
role as a coordinator for cultural diplomacy. Throughout 2007, MOFAT has
held a series of joint policy conferences with the Ministry of Culture, Sports and
Tourism to coordinate overseas cultural exchange programs hosted by a variety
of organizations. To that end, the Ministry drew up schedules for cultural
exchange programs in 2008 based on surveys on the demand for such events
from overseas missions. Under constantly changing circumstances, the Ministry
will continue to closely cooperate with domestic cultural organizations as well
as carefully monitor cultural trends overseas. The Ministry will faithfully carry
out its role as the hub of cultural diplomacy.

2) Cultural Agreements and Cultural Joint Commissions

In order to strengthen the cultural cooperation among the countries,
institutional frameworks such as agreements and intergovernmental cultural
exchange programs are a prerequisite. To that end, MOFAT has signed
agreements on cultural cooperation and drawn up cultural exchange programs
with an increasing number of countries, and has arranged Joint Cultural
Commissions with foreign governments to hold discussions on cultural issues.
In 2007, the Ministry concluded nine cultural agreements and exchange
programs and held Joint Cultural Commissions with six nations, including Brazil
(in July), Argentina (in July), Egypt (in September), Israel (in September), and
Japan (in May and November). The Joint Cultural Commissions covered
bilateral cultural exchanges in a comprehensive manner to raise awareness of
and improve a friendly sentiment towards Korea.


-----

3) The Northeast Asia Cultural Shuttle Project

At the first Korea-China-Japan Foreign Ministers’Meeting held in Jeju
Island, June 2007, the three foreign Ministers agreed to advance the “Northeast
Asia Cultural Shuttle Project”in order to facilitate cultural exchanges among the
three countries.
To establish a new momentum of cultural cooperation among the three
Northeast Asian countries, the Project aims at planning and implementing future
cultural exchanges and cooperation among Korea, China and Japan. The
project also seeks to encourage joint participation of both the public and private
sectors.
As a part of this Project, a “Special Session for the Three Nations’Films”
was held during the 2007 Busan International Film Festival, screening films
produced by collaboration among the three countries. The films included
works such as Hero, Assembly, and Soo.
The government hopes that enhancing cultural understanding among
peoples of the three countries will promote friendly ties, and that the
cooperative atmosphere will consequently spill over to other sectors such as
politics and the economy. The Project is expected to eventually contribute to
promoting peace and prosperity in the Northeast Asian region.


4) Support for Overseas Korean Studies

With the aim of spreading the Korean language overseas, MOFAT has
actively supported the establishment of professorships, Korean language
studies, Korean studies at overseas universities, Korea-related research and
publications, and academic seminars through its umbrella organization, Korea
Foundation.
To enlarge the base of Korean studies worldwide, MOFAT has supported
professorships and courses in 44 countries, and Korean studies programs in 20


-----

countries as of 2007. MOFAT has also fostered overseas Korean researchers and
specialists by providing Korean language training programs to 80 students from
30 countries and to 33 diplomats from 23 countries. To strengthen the
foundation of Korean studies worldwide, MOFAT has provided financial
support for the publication of Korea-related books and the dissemination of
various educational materials.

5) Support for Overseas Performances of Korean Art Groups

MOFAT has sent Korean performance groups abroad to help enhance
their performances to an international level and promote Korean cultural
images to the world.
In particular, 17 performance groups were sent to 35 countries for
important events including the ASEAN+3 Summit, IOC General Assembly, the
30[th] anniversary of diplomatic relations between Korea and Sri Lanka, new
Korean embassy launchings, and Korean cultural weeks hosted by overseas
Korean missions.
Performing groups were selected through evaluations on local cultural
characteristics and preferences by the cultural advisory committee consisting of
cultural experts in each genre, which ensured a fair and transparent process.
In those overseas performances, not only the local residents but also
government officials, businessmen, journalists and artists were invited to enjoy
Korea's rich culture. In order to prepare successful performances in the future,
MOFAT objectively evaluated cultural needs through surveys taken by the audiences
and the corresponding embassy personnel at the end of the performances.

6) Promoting the Uniqueness and Ingenuity of Korean Art
through Various Permanent Exhibitions in Embassies and
Consulates Abroad


MOFAT has supported the use of diplomatic missions as exhibition
spaces where the finest Korean works of arts are displayed to promote Korean
culture to foreigners and to enhance Korea’s image abroad. In 2007, 87 pieces
of art were sent to nine Korean embassies, including those in Brazil, the Czech
Republic, and Permanent Mission of the Republic of Korea to the Organization
of Economic Cooperation and Development. These art collections are carefully
reviewed by members of the Art Advisory Committee that continues to manage
the exhibitions. In addition, in cooperation with the Ministry of Culture, Sports
and Tourism, MOFAT will expand its exhibition project by leasing works of art
from the Art Bank of National Museum of Contemporary Art in order to
diversify the art collections.


-----

7) Supporting Overseas Screening of Korean Films and TV
Dramas

Daejanggum (Jewel In The Palace), SeulpeunYeonga (Sad Love Story),
and GaeulDonghwa (Fall Story), which represent TV dramas under Hallyu (the
Korean Wave), have been aired through state-run or privately managed
broadcasting stations in 10 countries including Saudi Arabia, Iran, Venezuela,
and the Republic of South Africa. The collaborative support for Korean TV
dramas forwarded by both MOFAT and foreign TV stations was much
welcomed by viewers. MOFAT has also endeavored to promote public
diplomacy through visual media, offering overseas TV stations videotapes that
publicize Korea and Korean culture, and further encouraged independent
development of Korea-related programs.
In particular, the pro-Han (pro-Korean) sentiment achieved through the
drama-supporting projects in the Middle East, African and Latin American
region will pave the way for government-driven energy diplomacy.
Moreover, in 2007, through MOFAT ’s support, Korean movie festivals
were held in 31 countries. Korean film festivals were widely hailed by many
people abroad as a positive contribution to widening the exposure of Korean
films and enhancing the image of a mature country.

###### 3. Expanding Activities of Cultural Diplomacy in the Multilateral Area

MOFAT has sought to broaden the horizon of its cultural diplomacy
in the international arena, by actively participating in the activities of
UNESCO, an international organization that leads international discussion
and cooperation in the field of education, science and culture.
In a diplomatic effort for international recognition of Korean cultural
and natural heritage for its outstanding universal value, MOFAT


-----

successfully achieved the inscription of the Jeju Volcanic Island and Lava
Tubes on UNESCO’s World Natural Heritage List and also of Printing
Woodblocks of the Tripitaka Koreana and Miscellaneous Buddhist
Scriptures on the Memory of the World Register in June 2007. With this,
the Republic of Korea has eight Korean heritage sites inscribed on the
World Heritage List, six items on the Memory of the World Register and
three items proclaimed Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of
Humanity.
The Korean government took part in the meetings for the
Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible
Cultural Heritage as an observer to proceed with follow up discussion on
such important issues as incorporation of items proclaimed as Masterpieces
into the Representative List, accreditation of NGOs, and use of resources
from the Intangible Heritage Fund. The Government has put a particular
emphasis on firmly establishing Korea’s prominence in the safeguarding of
intangible cultural heritage in Asia and the Pacific. In line with this goal,
since 2005 the Korean government has sought to establish a center in
Korea for the safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage in the Asia-Pacific
region under the auspices of UNESCO. In February 2008, the government
submitted a proposal, which requested the Director-General to conduct a
feasibility study on the proposed centre.
At the 14[th] session of the ICPRCP (Intergovernmental Committee for
Promoting the Return of Cultural Property to its Countries of Origin of its
Restitution in Case of Illicit Appropriation) held on June 6, 2007 in Paris, Korea
was chosen to host the extraordinary session of the ICPRCP to commemorate
the 30[th] anniversary of the Committee.
At the 34[th] General Conference which took place from October 16 to
November 3, 2007 in Paris, the Korean delegation, with Deputy Prime Minister
and Minister of Education and Human Resources Development Kim Shin-il as
its head, took an active part in the General Conference and various other
Committee meetings. On October 24, the General Conference held an election


-----

for the renewal of half of its 58 member countries and Korea was elected as a
member of the Board, taking on leadership responsibilities for the next four
years.
As culture has emerged as a core element determining national power
and competence in the 21[st] century, MOFAT pledges the expansion of its
cultural influence over the international community and promotion of Korea’s
image as a culturally advanced country, by strengthening its diplomacy toward
UNESCO.

###### 4. Implementing Cultural Diplomacy Intended for the Public

1) Mutual Cultural Exchange Project

MOFAT is promoting a Mutual Cultural Exchange Project, which
introduces the culture of regions where cultural exchange with Korea has been
relatively rare to citizens. It is hoped that the project will expose the public to

-----

cultures of other countries and promote understanding of cultural diversity. As
a part of the project, MOFAT held a “Caravan to Africa”event in Seoul in 2007
and provided citizens an opportunity to familiarize themselves with African
culture through performances, an exhibition, movies and workshops. This
year, MOFAT is planning to hold a “Central Asian Cultural Festival”in several
regions, including Seoul, to facilitate the public’s understanding of Central Asian
culture.


2) Opening of Cyber Art Gallery

In 2007, MOFAT opened a Cyber Art Gallery on its website in order to
provide citizens an opportunity to enjoy the finest works of art possessed by
MOFAT. Around 20 pieces of art are exhibited and replaced every 6 months to
ensure that citizens are able to appreciate various works of art.
In addition, MOFAT has added English translations of comments on the
works of art in order to promote Korea’s finest art to foreigners.

3) Lunchtime Concerts

To expand the cultural horizons of its staff, MOFAT has offered
convenient access to cultural events by hosting concerts during lunchtime at its
auditorium since 2007.
In 2007, talented music groups such as Gumho Asiana Soloists String
Quartet, Sookmyung Gayageum Team and Kang Eun-Il Haegum Plus held
successful performances. Cultural events of diverse genres will be held
regularly.
MOFAT hopes to establish an image of friendliness toward the public by
broadening access to the lunchtime concerts to other government staff or to the
public.

###### 5. Strengthening Sports Diplomacy

Major sporting events not only allow participation from people from all
over the world, regardless of race, religion, and ideology, but they also serve to
promote the image of the host nation. Korea successfully hosted the 1988 Seoul
Olympic Games and the 2002 World Cup, both of which provided good
opportunities to enhance Korea’s national image.
Recently, hosting international sporting events have served as a stepping


-----

stone for a nation’s development and the dissemination of its culture and social
conditions all over the world. Therefore, countries all over the world compete
fiercely to host international sporting events.
In response to these trends, MOFAT is making an effort to reinforce
Korea’s sports diplomacy, supporting sports exchange programs worldwide.
In 2007, MOFAT, in cooperation with Korean Embassies abroad, fully
supported efforts to host the 2011 Daegu IAAF World Championships in
Athletics and the 2014 Incheon Asian Games. Not only has MOFAT supported
bids to host such major multi-sports events, but it has also supported efforts to
host single-sports international competitions. For example, MOFAT supported
Sangjoo City in its bid to host the 2010 World University Equestrian
Championships, and succeeded over Aachen, Germany, one of the major
Equestrian nations.
As Taekwondo has become one of the most beloved Korean sports in the
international community, MOFAT has given support in sending Taekwondo
performance teams abroad every year. This has contributed to the
popularization of Taekwondo and maintenance of amicable relations with
foreign countries.
In cooperation with the Korea Taekwondo Association, MOFAT sent
Taekwondo performance teams to LA, Guatemala, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and
Uzbekistan in 2007 and plans to send them to Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, Libya,
Italy, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore and the USA in 2008. In addition, Korean
Embassies abroad have held annual Taekwondo competitions to advertise
Taekwondo as well as Korean culture.


-----

###### 6. Supporting Local Authorities for International Relations

MOFAT supports the international relations efforts of local governments in
order to strengthen their ties with other nations. To that end, MOFAT has
organized international events (conferences) and international cultural
exchange programs to publicize Korean culture. The number of sister cities
between Korean local governments and those in other nations is over 700,
which shows the dynamism in globalized networking between local
governments. International relations among sister cities have been diversifying
in many areas such as culture, arts, youth exchange and sports exchange.
MOFAT has sent Advisory Ambassadors for International Relations with
vast experience in international cooperation to 10 local governments. These
ambassadors have actively offered advice to various local governments on their
overall programs for international exchange and cooperation. These
ambassadors have contributed to enlarging the economy, trade, and culture
exchange of local governments and have assisted in the bids by local
governments to host international sporting events.

### UNESCO and Cultural Diplomacy

Extracts from a contribution
to The Hankyoreh by Bae Jae-hyun,
Director-General of Cultural Affairs

The Republic of Korea has actively participated in the World Heritage Committee, one of the
most important intergovernmental committees in UNESCO, and various other committees
and subsidiary organs of the General Conference. [...]

The Korean government has also made a significant contribution to many of UNESCO’s
educational and cultural programs by contributing funds-in-trust to the Organization. As a
country that has transformed itself from a beneficiary to an important benefactor to
UNESCO, Korea has become a model of successful economic development for many
developing countries, and has strived to help the third world in their efforts to overcome
poverty and to promote peace.

UNESCO can be a useful channel for strengthening cooperation between North and South
Korea. To take one example, the UNESCO funds-in-trust project for conservation of the
Koguryo Tombs in North Korea is acknowledged to have made a valuable contribution in
conserving heritage by monitoring the tombs and their mural paintings under the guidance of
international experts. The Korean government intends to accelerate the South-North


-----

cooperation through UNESCO by exploring more projects like the Koguryo Tombs project for
furthering such cooperation.

The government of Korea, which proposed the establishment of the Living Human Treasures
System to UNESCO to foster transmission of knowledge and skills of bearers and practitioners
of intangible cultural heritage, hopes to establish an “Intangible Cultural Heritage Centre for the
Asia-Pacific”as a UNESCO Category 2 centre. This year, Korea will host the extraordinary
session of ICPRCP (Intergovernmental Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural
Property to its Countries of Origin or its Restitution in case of illicit Appropriation) to
commemorate the Committee’s 30[th] anniversary and to raise public awareness on the issue of
cultural property removed from its country of origin. Furthermore, by ratifying the UNESCO
Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions, the
Korean government aims to promote Korea’s image as a culturally advanced country that
seeks universality based on cultural diversity.

“Culture”is the key word for the 21[st] century. In this age of culture, it is necessary to play a
more active and leading role in the activities of UNESCO to deliver cultural diplomacy that is
commensurate with our international standing and promotes our national interests.

Recently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade reorganized its structure, giving the Cultural
Affairs Bureau authority to handle all UNESCO affairs, work which had previously been shared
by the Cultural Affairs Bureau and the International Organizations Bureau. With this, the
Ministry has made a particular effort to carry out unified diplomacy toward UNESCO by
collecting and concentrating all available resources and capabilities from various ministries and
agencies involved. In order for these initiatives to bear fruit, public interest and support for the
government’s efforts are more indispensable than ever.

###### Chapter 5 Expanding the Legal Basis for Foreign Relations and Foreign Activities

In the international community, numerous agreements are made between
states, just as there are promises between citizens in a state. These international
agreements are usually documented to ensure their bona fide observation.
These documented international agreements are called treaties. Defined as an
international agreement concluded between states in written form and
governed by international law, a treaty creates legal rights and obligations for its
parties and constitutes an important source of international law. The Korean
government is continually striving to strengthen its legal basis for international
relations and foreign activities by concluding treaties, as well as by participating
in the global norm-making process on various international issues.


###### 1. Conclusion of Treaties in 2007

From the establishment of the Korean government in 1948 until 2007,
2,492 treaties - 1,934 bilateral and 558 multilateral - were concluded by the
Republic of Korea and came into force. In the first thirteen-year period from
1948 to 1960, only 129 treaties - 88 bilateral and 41 multilateral - came into
force, whereas in the seven-year period from 2001 to 2007, 565 treaties - 446
bilateral and 119 multilateral - came into force.

In 2007, 95 treaties - 79 bilateral, 16 multilateral - were concluded and
came into force. While treaties in economic, legal, social and cultural fields are
constantly pursued in view of their direct influence on the public, priority is
also given to treaties in other fields such as the environment and resources.
In the fields of economy and trade, the Free Trade Agreement among
Korea and the Member Countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), including the Framework Agreement on Comprehensive Economic
Cooperation, the Agreement on Dispute Settlement Mechanism and the
Agreement on Trade in Goods, entered into force in June 2007. Furthermore,
four bilateral agreements on the reciprocal promotion and protection of
investments, four on the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of
fiscal evasion, and three on social security came into force in 2007. These
agreements are expected to provide a system for preventing double taxation
and double payment of social security contributions by Korean nationals and
nationals of the countries which are parties to the agreements.
In the fields of science and technology, the Agreement on the
Establishment of the ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor)
International Fusion Energy Organization for the Joint Implementation of the
ITER Project, which entered into force in October 2007, formed the basis of
cooperation among nations in implementing the ITER. Cooperation agreements
with Russia and Ukraine on the peaceful exploration and use of outer space
also came into force in 2007. In addition, in the field of environment,
agreements on the protection of migratory birds with China and Australia, and
in the field of energy, an agreement on nuclear energy with Ukraine, came into
force that year.

In the field of mutual legal assistance, treaties on mutual legal assistance
in criminal matters with Mexico, Japan and Algeria, and treaties on extradition
with Hong Kong and Indonesia, came into force in 2007. In the social sector,
especially concerning human rights, the Optional Protocol to the Convention
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women entered into
force in January 2007 and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities was signed in March 2007. Furthermore, the Republic of Korea has
been participating in worldwide efforts to develop human rights norms and
withdrew its reservation concerning article 14(5) of the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights. In the fields of culture and tourism, agreements
with Indonesia on culture, with Greece on tourism and with France on film coproduction came into force. Furthermore, numerous arrangements with
developing countries on loans from Korea’s Economic Development
Cooperation Fund were concluded.

Finally, 13 treaties with international organizations, including the
Agreement Between the Government of the Republic of Korea and the
International Labor Organization on Korea/ILO Partnership Programme, and the
Agreement Between the Government of the Republic of Korea and the United
Nations Environment Programme on the Establishment of a Trust Fund for
Priority Projects to Improve the Environment in the Democratic Peoples’
Republic of Korea were concluded and entered into force in 2007.

###### 2. Legal Approaches to Major International Issues

1) Active Participation in Multilateral Treaty-making

The Korean government has also actively participated in the process to
establish universal norms with respect to a variety of international issues. As a
result, as mentioned above, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women entered into force,
the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was signed, and
reservation concerning the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights was withdrawn. The Convention Abolishing the Requirement of
Legalization for Foreign Public Documents entered into force in July 2007. The
government also deposited its instrument of acceptance to the Protocol
Amending the TRIPS Agreement in January 2007, its instrument of ratification
of the Convention Concerning Safety in the Use of Asbestos in April 2007, and
its instrument of accession of the Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War
(Protocol Ⅴ) in January 2008.
In order to contribute to the development and codification of
international law, the government has been involved in the legislative
activities of the UN International Law Commission (ILC). Moreover, the
government has actively participated in other international law organizations
such as the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law
(UNCITRAL), the Hague Conference on Private International Law (HccH), and
the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT).
The government has also contributed to the formation of international
conventions at conferences held by international organizations such as the
International Maritime Organizations (IMO), the UN Committee on the Peaceful
Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) and the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO). Futhermore, the government participated in a number of
international meetings relating to Antarctica, including the Antarctic Treaty


-----

Consultative Meeting (ATCM) and the annual meeting of the Commission for
the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR).
In addition, the government has participated in the international
community’s codification activities by attending, among others, the Assembly of
States Parties of the International Criminal Court, the Expert Meeting on
International Humanitarian Law, the Meeting of the Contracting Parties to the
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the Council of the
International Seabed Authority.


2) Negotiation with Neighboring States on Maritime Delimitation

Since the declaration of its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in 1996, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of United Nations Convention on the
Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) the Republic of Korea has devoted its efforts to
negotiating with the People’s Republic of China and Japan concerning the
delimitation of the maritime boundaries in the Yellow Sea, the East Sea and the
East China Sea.
In March and June 2007, Korea held consultations with Japan on the
delimitation of the EEZ, maintaining its basic approach of regarding Dokdo as
its base point for delimitation. In the meanwhile, Korea held the 12[th] Maritime
Delimitation Meeting with China in December 2007 in Jeju Island and discussed
principles of boundary delimitation based on international law. The Korean
government will continue to devote all its efforts to negotiating with its
neighboring nations in compliance with the UNCLOS and international law.


-----

###### 3. Enhancing Public Awareness of International Law and Strengthening Legal Capacity

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade has advanced the publication of
guide-books and information on international law in order to promote
understanding of government and civil agencies in that area.
In February and July 2007, the Ministry produced and distributed books
respectively entitled An Overview of Bilateral Treaties and An Overview of
Multilateral Treaties. It also published a book entitled How to Conclude
Agency-to-Agency Arrangements in October 2007 to assist government
departments and local governments with their administration. How to
Conclude Agency-to-Agency Arrangements includes points to consider when
concluding arrangements, actual examples of arrangements reviewed by the
Treaties Division and solutions to possible problems.
The Ministry held a seminar in December 2007 and several lectures on
treaties and arrangements for central and local government officials in order to
promote their understanding of this field.
Finally, the Ministry published A Collection of International Treaties and
Other Legal Instruments in December 2007, in order to strengthen the
international competitiveness of the ROK by enhancing accessibility to
information about international law. The publication includes 114 basic
international legal texts, including major international treaties and other
agreements related to the ROK. These include major multilateral treaties in the
field of the rights and obligations of States, privileges and immunities, human
rights, international terrorism, disarmament and non-proliferation, the use of
force, and the environment, as well as bilateral treaties including the mutual
defense treaty between Korea and the U.S., agreements on fisheries between
Korea and Japan and between Korea and China, and the Korean war armistice
agreement, and Korean national law including the Constitution. The
publication is expected to help the general public as well as those engaged in
international law, such as academics, gain easier access to international legal
materials.

###### Chapter 1 Expansion of Free Trade Agreements

 1. Overview

As globalization continues to spread and deepen, the Korean government
has actively promoted FTAs with diverse partners as an important tool in
creating dynamism conducive to Korea’s economic growth and developing
Korea into an “advanced, open trading nation.”Since 2003, Korea’s FTA policy
has especially been geared towards adjusting its own economy to global
market trends for greater openness and economic regionalism. By 2006, Korea
concluded four FTAs with 15 nations, such as Chile, Singapore, EFTA, and
ASEAN (on trade in goods and services). All of the four FTAs have since then
been smoothly implemented as scheduled.
The year 2007 was a year full of vibrant FTA negotiations for Korea: the
Korea-U.S. FTA was concluded on April 2, and FTA negotiations with the EU
was launched on May 6. FTA negotiations with a total of 41 countries including
Canada, Mexico, India, and ASEAN (on trade in investment) are currently being
conducted.
At the same time, the Korean government conducted FTA feasibility
studies with several trading partners including China, MERCOSUR, Australia,
New Zealand, Peru and Russia. The Korean government also agreed with the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to launch FTA negotiations in 2008. The first
round of negotiations is expected to be held in July 2008. Meanwhile, the
government also plans to continuously explore the feasibility of concluding an
FTA with other potential economic partners, including Turkey, Southern
African Customs Union (SACU) and Egypt.
Korea’s FTA policy will remain as one of the most important economic
policies for the following years. By building a strategic FTA network, the

###### 2. Conclusion and Implementation of Free Trade Agreements


1) Implementation of Korea-Chile FTA

In order to successfully implement the Korea-Chile FTA, Korea and Chile
engaged in four Free Trade Commission (FTC) meetings since the entry-intoforce of the Agreement on April 1, 2004. In addition, various Committees
established under the Agreement held a total of 14 meetings in order to monitor


-----

the implementation of relevant chapters of the Agreement.
In 2007 alone, four committee meetings were held along with the FTC
meeting to discuss ways to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the principal
areas of the Agreement, including trade in goods, sanitary and phytosanitary
measures (SPS), telecommunications standards, and technical barriers to trade
(TBT).
At the fourth meeting of the Committee on Trade in Goods held in
Santiago, Chile, on October 24-25, Korea and Chile revised product specific
rules of origin (PSR) covered by the Agreement, reflecting the recommendation
of the World Customs Organization (WCO) to bring the existing 2002
Harmonized System (HS) product nomenclature in conformity with the updated
2007 HS.
At the fourth FTC meeting held in Seoul, on November 6-7, Korea and
Chile evaluated and endorsed the recommendations of the various committees.
In addition, both countries reviewed the overall outcome of the implementation
of the Agreement made during the previous three years and discussed ways to
achieve further development.
The growth of bilateral trade since the entry into force of the Agreement
in April 2004, demonstrates the positive economic effects of the Korea-Chile
FTA. Trade volume has increased by 48.8% in the first year (April 2004 - March
2005), 37% in the second year (April 2005 - March 2006), and 56.9% in the third
year (April 2006 - March 2007). The growth rate of Korean exports to Chile also
significantly increased from 9.6% to 58.2% during the first year after the entryinto-force of Korea-Chile FTA. Korean exports further increased by 46.6% in
the second year and 49.8% in the third year. Korea’s leading exports such as
automobiles, mobile phones, and color TVs showed salient export growth
since the immediate tariff elimination.
The significant increase of Korea’s market share in Chile is another
indicator of the success of the Korea-Chile FTA. The market share of Korean
products in Chile’s import market increased from 3.0% in 2003 to 7.2% in 2007,
thus ranking rising to fifth from the previous seventh place.


-----

2) Implementation of Korea-Singapore FTA

The first ad hoc customs committee meeting was held in July 2007 to
discuss the replacement of the HS code system and the rules of origin.
Although not enough time has passed to thoroughly evaluate the effects
of the Korea-Singapore FTA, since it came into effect in March 2006, until
January 2008, bilateral trade has increased by 48.2%. In particular, Korea’s
export volume to Singapore increased by 61.7%, which highlights the positive
effects of the Korea-Singapore FTA. During the same period of time, import
volumes from Singapore increased by 29.8%, resulting in a trade surplus of
$8.69 billion, an increase by 150.5%.
Initially, some concerns were raised over the FTA with Singapore because
there was speculation that an FTA with a tariff-free country would increase
imports from Singapore due to Korea’s unilateral tariff cut, and worsen Korea’s
trade balance.
In reality, Korean exports increased much greater than the increase in
imports from Singapore, leading to a surge in Korea’s trade surplus.
Furthermore, the share of Korean products in the Singapore import market
continued to rise by 4.3% in 2005, 4.4% in 2006 and 4.9% in 2007. Such
expansion could be explained by the positive effect of FTAs, including the
promotion of international awareness of Korea’s products and the removal of
non-tariff barriers as well as tariff cuts. The Korea-Singapore FTA is also
expected to trigger further increase in bilateral investment.
The Korea-Singapore FTA is also significant in the fact that it was the first
FTA to recognize goods from the Gaeseong Industrial Complex (GIC) as
Korean-made. It has set a precedent for Korea’s subsequent efforts in gaining
similar recognition from EFTA, ASEAN and the U.S.


-----

3) Implementation of Korea-EFTA FTA

Korea’s FTA with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA),
composed of Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein, four small yet
economically vibrant Western European economies, entered into force on
September 1, 2006.
Since the Agreement went into effect in July 2007, the trade volume
between Korea and EFTA increased by 13.1%. During the same period, Korea’s
total exports to EFTA decreased by 35%, due to the decrease of exports in the
areas of shipping, gold, and artwork, which are subject to irregular demands
and fluctuations. Excluding these items, the overall volume of exports increased
by 6.9%.
In particular, items such as electric motion, textiles, and other textile
products, which are expected to enjoy substantive tariff reduction, accounted
for the majority of increase in exports. Korean imports from the EFTA countries
increased by 53.7%.
What is more noteworthy in the Korea-EFTA FTA is that a new business
model has developed, in which raw materials imported from EFTA countries
are processed in Korea, and then re-exported, tax-free to EFTA countries as end
products. For instance, Norwegian-made components for ships are imported
into Korea to build special ships, and then re-exported to Norway tax-free. A
review by the WTO RTA committee on the Korea-EFTA FTA is expected to take
place during the second half of 2008.

4) Korea - U.S. FTA

(1) Conclusion of Korea-U.S. FTA

Korea and the U.S. held three preliminary working-level conferences and
six trade ministers’meetings in 2005 to review the need for and the feasibility of
the Korea-U.S. (KORUS) FTA. Building on these efforts, Korea and the U.S.


-----

officially announced the launch of FTA negotiations on February 3, 2006.
The negotiations covered 19 areas, including Market Access (MA) and
National Treatment (NT) for Goods, Agriculture, Trade Remedies, Services,
Investment, Intellectual Property
Rights, Competition, Labor, and
Environment. From the first round
in June 2006 to the final senior-level
talks at the end of March 2007, ten
official negotiating sessions were
held. Despite various obstacles in
the process, the two countries
showed much determination and
finally reached an agreement in Conclusion of the KORUS FTA

(Seoul, April 2, 2007)

Seoul on April 2, 2007.
In May 2007, accommodating the Democrats’position on the FTA, the
U.S. Administration and the Congress negotiated the ‘New Trade Policy’which
strengthened labor and environment standards. In mid-June, the U.S.
government subsequently requested additional consultations with Korea as well
as Peru, Panama and Columbia in order to reflect the new policy into pending
FTAs. Coming to a conclusion that the request for additional consultations
would not alter the balance of interests between the two countries, the Korean
government agreed on a final text of the agreement which reflected the
outcome of the additional consultations, and signed it on June 30, 2007 in
Washington D.C.


-----

(2) Progress in Ratification Procedures

Recognizing that an early ratification and entry into force of the KORUS
FTA is necessary to maximize its economic effect, the Korean government
submitted the KORUS FTA ratification bill to the National Assembly on
September 7, 2007. On the same day, Prime Minister, Han Duck-soo
emphasized the necessity of early ratification of the KORUS FTA through a
public statement, and pledged to make every effort to ensure smooth
deliberations in the National Assembly.
The Korean government spared no effort in promoting favorable
circumstances for the ratification, establishing programs to mitigate its possible
negative impacts as well as enacting and revising laws and regulations for the
implementation of the KORUS FTA. However, the KORUS FTA ratification bill
was not placed on the agenda in the Unification, Foreign Affairs & Trade
Committee of the National Assembly until February 13, 2008 due to the
impending political events, including the presidential election in December
2007. The Committee held public hearings on the KORUS FTA and heard
experts’opinions on February 15, 2008.
The U.S. administration also emphasized to the Congress the necessity of
approving the KORUS FTA at the earliest date possible. The U.S. International
Trade Commission (ITC) submitted a report titled The U.S.-Korea Free Trade
Agreement: Potential Economy-wide and Selected Sectoral Effects to the
Congress in September, 2007. By doing so, the necessary legal procedures
before the deliberation of the Congress were completed. However, as the U.S.
wishes to deal with the U.S.- Columbia FTA before the KORUS FTA in the order
of the completion of the negotiations, the development of the U.S.-Columbia
FTA ratification process is likely to influence the approval of the KORUS FTA.


-----

(3) Key Outcomes of Negotiations and Its Assessment

The KORUS FTA, which was concluded after considerable preparatory
efforts and an entire year of difficult negotiations, is considered to have
successfully achieved a fair balance of interests between the two sides.
In MA/NT for Goods, tariffs on 94% of goods in terms of import amount
are to be eliminated within 3 years. In the agricultural sector, various
exceptional treatments such as exclusion from concessions, maintenance of
current tariffs and agricultural safeguards, are provided to Korea’s most sensitive
items including rice, orange (during harvest season), edible soybeans and
potatoes, powdered milk, and natural honey. In services and investments,
Korea and the U.S. sought to lock-in existing measures of liberalization and to
gradually liberalize sectors where liberalization could enhance their
competitiveness as well. Korea also reaffirmed its liberalization plan in legal,
accounting, and taxation services. The agreement also presented new
opportunities to upgrade systems in the area of protection of intellectual
property rights, competition, government procurement and transparency.
The KORUS FTA is expected to provide the Korean economy with a new
engine for economic growth by improving access to the U.S. market for Korean
firms, and by promoting reform within the Korean economic system. A joint
study was published on the economic effects of the KORUS FTA on April 30,
2007 by eleven research institutions, including the Korea Institute for
International Economic Policy (KIEP). According to the study, the KORUS FTA
would increase Korea’s export vis-a-vis the U.S. by an average of $2.55 billion�
per year. In addition, it would increase Korea’s real GDP by 6.0%
(approximately 80 trillion won) over ten years, and improve Korea’s trade
balance vis-a-vis the U.S. by $4.6 billion and vis-a-vis the world by $20 billion� �
during a 10-year period after the Agreement enters into force.

###### 3. Ongoing Negotiations of Free Trade Agreements

1) Korea-EU FTA

The EU is Korea’s second largest trading partner and the largest source of
foreign investment. Negotiations for an FTA between Korea and the EU
were officially launched by Kim Hyun-jong, the Korean Trade Minister and
Peter Mandelson, the EU Trade Commissioner on May 2007.


The first round of the Korea-EU FTA negotiations
(Seoul, May 7, 2007)


Following the first round of negotiations held on May 7-11, 2007 in Seoul,
five more rounds of talks were held up to November 2007. The Korea-EU FTA
negotiations have been progressing at a rather fast pace, achieving substantial
progress in many areas. The major pending issues are tariff offers on goods,
automobile standards, and rules of origin (including the issue of determining
the origin of products from the “Gaeseong”Industrial Complex). Korea and the
EU have pursued the most practical, comprehensive and WTO-plus FTA,
which is in conformity with the WTO criteria, aiming to conclude FTA
negotiations within year 2008.


-----

The Korea-EU FTA is strategically important for Korea in its pursuit to
become the “East Asian FTA Hub”that connects Europe, East Asia, and the
United States. An FTA with the EU is expected give a boost to Korea’s exports,
considering the EU’s high average tariff rate (4.2%) in comparison to that of the
U.S. (3.7%) as well as relatively high levels of tariff rates placed on our main
export items, such as automobiles (10%), TVs and video equipment (14%), and
textiles and shoes (12~17%). The Korea-EU FTA is also expected to increase
Korea’s overall GDP to the level no less than the impact of the Korea-U.S. FTA,
and create even more jobs.


2) Korea-ASEAN FTA

On June 1, 2007, the Korea-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement on Goods
entered into force along with the Frame Agreement and the Agreement on
Dispute Settlement Mechanism. Under the Agreement, 45% of Korean goods
exported to ASEAN members will enjoy low tariff rates of 0-5% and 63% of
ASEAN goods exported to Korea will enjoy zero tariff rates.
In 2007, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Myanmar, and Indonesia
commenced its implementation. In the meantime, Korea separately held five
rounds of negotiations for tariff concession of goods with the Thai government
who had not been participating in the negotiations in 2006 due to domestic
political situations. Both sides finally concluded concession negotiations in
order to sign the Agreement on Trade in Goods on December 18.
ASEAN, with a population of 500 million and an annual economic growth
rate of 6%, is the world’s fourth largest export market and is still an emerging
market with much potentials. However, in the past, ASEAN maintained high
tariff rates on imports. The reduction of tariffs is expected to increase Korea’s
exports to ASEAN by approximately $4.2 billion and achieve approximately a
$1.5 billion trade surplus annually in the mid- and long- term.
Following the Agreement on Trade in Goods, the Agreement on Trade in


-----

Services was signed on November 21, 2007 in Singapore on the occasion of the
Korea-ASEAN Summit. Most ASEAN members have opened their markets
beyond their WTO commitment levels in areas such as computers,
telecommunications, shipping, construction, and financial services where Korea
has export interests.
Meanwhile, Korea and ASEAN are negotiating an investment agreement,
aiming to conclude the agreement within the year 2008.

3) Korea-Canada FTA

Korea and Canada have held 14 rounds of official meetings since the
launch of negotiations in July 2005, where issues covering market access in
goods, services (including finance, telecommunications and temporary entry),
investment, competition, government procurement, labor and environmental
cooperation have been intensively negotiated.
As a result, both sides achieved a substantial progress in a wide range of
sectors, leaving only a handful of key outstanding issues. The success of the
FTA rests on the outcome of upcoming talks over the remaining, but critical
issues.
Once successfully concluded, the Korea-Canada FTA will strengthen the
bilateral economic partnership and reinforce their complimentary trading
structures: Korea’s competitive manufacturing industry complements Canada’s
abundant natural resources. Canada is also important to Korea in the sense that
it can serve as the gateway to the North American market. Therefore, in the
course of negotiations, the government plans to exert much effort in ensuring a
high level of trade liberalization, while giving due consideration to Korea’s
sensitive sectors.


-----

4) Korea-India CEPA

Korea and India have held nine rounds of negotiations since the launch
of the Korea-India Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA)
negotiations in March 2006 up to December 2007. The negotiations have been
delayed beyond the target year of 2007, because India has consistently
expressed difficulty in increasing the level of trade liberalization as requested by
Korea. The Korean government will try to finalize the negotiations by the end
of 2008, coordinating its goal of pursuing a high level of trade liberalization,
keeping in consideration India’s sensitive areas such as its weak manufacturing
industrial basis.
India is the first country from BRICs (Brasil, Russia, India, and China) with
which Korea has initiated FTA talks. India has a strategic value as an economic
hub in Southwest Asia and as a large emerging market showing a rigorous
annual growth rate of over 8%. In light of the complementary economic
structures of the two countries, the benefits from the Korea-India CEPA are
expected to be substantial. A study by the Korea Institute for International
Economic Policy (KIEP) showed that once tariffs on most goods are eliminated
under the Korea-India CEPA, Korea would gain $2.3 billion in trade balances
and a GDP increase of 1.3 trillion Korean Won.


5) Resumption of Korea-Mexico FTA

On August 8, 2007, Korea and Mexico officially agreed to resume the
once-stalled Strategic Economic Complementation Agreement (SECA)
negotiations and upgrade it into high-level and comprehensive FTA
negotiations. The SECA negotiations were stalled after three rounds of
negotiations in February-June 2006 due to a difference in positions over the
level of tariff concessions.
The resumed FTA negotiations pursues a higher level of liberalization


-----

and more comprehensive coverage than what was agreed for SECA. In this
vein, the first round of Korea-Mexico FTA negotiations was held in Mexico
City on December 5-7, 2007. A Korea-Mexico FTA is expected to expand
business opportunities for Korean companies entering into the North and
Central American market. In addition, it is expected to considerably contribute
to ameliorating the political and strategic partnership between the two
countries.

###### 4. Laying the Groundwork for FTAs with Major Trade Partners

1) Joint Study of Korea-China FTA

At the bilateral Trade Ministerial Meeting held on the sidelines of the
APEC Ministerial Meeting, Korea and China agreed to begin a Joint Study on the
feasibility of Korea-China FTA, involving the governments, businesses and
academic scholars of both sides. The two parties have held four rounds of joint
study meetings since March 2007. At the first meeting in Beijing in March 2007,
the terms of reference and a table of contents of the Joint Study were discussed.
Chapters on trade in goods including the manufacturing industry, agriculture,
fishery and forestry were discussed during the second meeting in Seoul in July.
Chapters on trade in services and investment were discussed during the third
meeting in Weihai in October. During the fourth meeting in Jeju Island in
February 2008, chapters on other issues such as government procurement,
intellectual property, SPS, TBT and economic cooperation were discussed.
An FTA with China will create a favorable condition for Korean
companies to gain early access to the Chinese market. However, some negative
backlashes are anticipated in the domestic agricultural sector because of the
similarity in agricultural products, consumption structures and the geological


-----

adjacency of the two countries. Therefore, launching FTA negotiations with
China will be decided after reviewing the results of the Joint Study, and after an
appropriate mechanism is arranged to address the sensitivities of the Korean
agriculture and fishery sector. In addition, the opinions of domestic stakeholders will be put into consideration prior to launching negotiations.


2) Preliminary Talks of Korea-GCC FTA

The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is the largest economic bloc and
customs union in the Middle East and is composed of six Arab Gulf states:
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The
GCC is Korea’s fifth trading partner, accounting for $7.8 billion in Korea’s
exports (eighth for Korea’s exports) and $54.1 billion in imports (first for Korea’s
imports). Oil and petroleum products consist of 98% ($52.7 billion) of total
imports from the GCC.
On the occasion of the President’s official visit to Saudi Arabia and Qatar
in March 2007, Korea and the GCC agreed that a Korea-GCC FTA would serve
as a springboard for developing both economies and strengthening political
ties. Following Korea-GCC FTA preliminary talks in November 2007 and a


Public hearing on Korea-GCC FTA (Seoul, January 22, 2008)


-----

public hearing on a possible Korea-GCC FTA on January 22, 2008, the Korean
Government officially decided to launch the Korea-GCC FTA negotiations at the
Minister’s Meeting on International Economic Policy on January 25, 2008.
According to a study by the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy
(KIEP), the Korea-GCC FTA is expected to increase Korea’s annual exports by
$260 million and imports by $700 million, achieving a growth rate of 4.9% and
2.4% respectively.

3) Feasibility Study of Korea-MERCOSUR FTA

Korea has taken interest in engaging in an FTA with MERCOSUR, which is
one of the largest economic integration communities in Central and Southern
America with a population of 220 million. During President Roh’s visit to South
America in November 2004, Korea, Brazil and Argentina agreed to launch a
joint feasibility study on the Korea-MERCOSUR Trade Agreement (TA). As a
result, four rounds of intergovernmental joint research studies were held until
its completion in December 2006.
The feasibility study on a Korea-MERCOSUR TA was officially adopted at
the sixth Korea-MERCOSUR policy consultation meeting held in Montevideo,
Uruguay in October 2007. The report suggested that an FTA between Korea
and MERCOSUR would increase Korea’s GDP between 0.17% to 2%, and
0.02% to 2.74% for MERCOSUR. Korean exports of electronic products, cellular
phones, LCDs, medical supplies and textiles would significantly increase,
whereas MERCOSUR expects to increase exports of beef, orange juice, bean
and other agricultural products to Korea.
The official conclusion of the joint study does not serve as a prerequisite
condition for the launching of FTA negotiations. The future of a KoreaMERCOSUR FTA will be determined based on a thorough examination of the
joint study report and the assessment of various opinions from domestic
corporations and academic institutions.


-----

4) Private Joint Study of Korea-China-Japan FTA

President Kim Dae-jung’s suggestion at the summit meeting among
Korea, China and Japan in 1999 initiated a trilateral joint study in the area of
economic cooperation. On the occasion of the joint study, discussions on the
promotion of a possible Korea-China-Japan FTA commenced.
As a follow-up to the summit meeting, research institutions of the three
countries conducted the first phase of research on the topic of development of
trade facilitation and the expansion of direct investment among the three
countries.
The Korean government took the initiative of conducting a joint study
based on its Northeast Asian Cooperation scheme. On the occasion of the
trilateral summit meeting in 2002, it was agreed to continue the joint study on
the economic feasibility of the Korea-China-Japan FTA as the first assignment
for the second phase of research. The Korea Institute for International
Economic Policy (KIEP) from Korea, the Development Research Center of the
State Council of China (DRC) from China, and the National Institute for
Research Advancement (NIRA) from Japan joined this research.
Business institutions such as the Federation of Korean Industries, the
China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, and the Federation of
Japanese Industries have also engaged in the research project since 2006. The
scope of participation has expanded since 2007 with government officials from
three countries participating as observers.
The joint study adopts its annual report by holding two workshops and a
symposium per year. Its outcome is reported to the leaders of the three
countries at summit meetings held on the occasion of the ASEAN+3 summit. In
2007, the joint study published and released a report titled The Study on the
Perspectives and Potentials of the Korea-China-Japan FTA. The three countries
are discussing the way to elevate this private study into a government-led
triangular study, involving the governments, businesses and academic scholars
of the three respective countries.


-----

5) Joint Study of Korea-Australia, Korea-New Zealand FTAs

During President Roh’s national visit to Australia and New Zealand in
December 2006, it was agreed to launch a Joint Study on FTA. KIEP conducted
three meetings with ITS Global from Australia and with the New Zealand
Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) from New Zealand, respectively,
during the year 2007.
Australia and New Zealand have been actively engaged in pursuing FTA
negotiations with Korea. Meanwhile, the Korean government is taking into
account the various factors including the opinions of domestic stakeholders, the
results of the joint study and the effects on sensitive areas such as the
agriculture industry in deciding the future direction of a possible FTA with
Australia and New Zealand respectively.

###### Chapter 2 Energy, Resources and Environmental Diplomacy

 1. Endeavors to Secure Energy and Resources


Korea is the fourth largest importer of oil and the tenth largest energy
consumer in the world. Against this backdrop, securing a stable supply of
energy and resources is a top national priority directly connected to Korea’s
continuous economic growth. In particular, faced with soaring oil prices,
cutthroat competition for energy and rampant “energy nationalism,”the Korean
government has been pursuing energy diplomacy through diversifying energy
supplies, laying institutional foundations for energy cooperation and
establishing regional and global cooperative networks.


1) Diversification of Energy Sources

(1) Summit Diplomacy with Countries in the Middle East


In March 2007, President Roh Moo-hyun pursued summit diplomacy for
energy during his state visits to Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. President Roh
discussed with the leaders of Middle Eastern countries concerted cooperation to
strengthen energy cooperation and to stabilize the world energy market.
President Roh also exerted diplomatic efforts to cement stronger strategic
relationships with Middle Eastern countries.


-----

(2) Collaborative Foundations for Energy Cooperation in East Siberia and
Far East Regions

Korea participated in the third Far East Siberia Committee held in
Blagoveshchensk in April 2007 to reinforce its energy cooperation with East
Siberia and Far East regions in Russia and discussed practical ways to pursue
energy cooperation in the regions. The Korean government also participated in
the second Russian Far East Economy Forum in Khabarovsk in September 2007
and discussed the prospects of energy businesses in Russia.

(3) Strengthening Energy Diplomacy with Asia and Latin America

As part of an effort to diversify energy sources, the government has
strived to strengthen energy diplomacy with Asia and Latin America. In 2007
alone, it dispatched public and private delegations to discuss and promote
resources development projects to Bangladesh (January), Turkmenistan (May),
Vietnam (May-June), Mongolia (June, November), Ukraine (June), and
Venezuela and Ecuador (August).
In addition, the government has also engaged in regular dialogues on
energy via intergovernmental consultation channels with energy-rich countries
such as Myanmar (February), Azerbaijan (April), Mongolia (May), Uzbekistan,
Chile, Australia and Peru (November), and Brazil and Russia (December).

(4) Exploring New Regions for Energy Cooperation

The government also has made efforts to explore and develop new
regions that have potential to become strategic partners in energy cooperation.
In particular, the government established stronger energy cooperation with Iraq
through dispatching public and private delegations to the Kurdish region in
January, 2007. On this occasion, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on
the development of oil fields between the Korea National Oil Corporation
(KNOC) and the Kurdish Ministry of Natural Resource (MNR) was signed.


-----

Furthermore, the government also held a Korea-Iraq energy ministers meeting
in April and Korea-Iraq resource cooperation committee in September. The
Production Sharing Contract (PSC) on the Bazian oilfield was signed in
November between a Korean consortium led by KNOC and the Kurdistan
Regional Government.


2) Institutional Foundations for Energy Cooperation

The Korean government initiated an agreement on energy resource
cooperation with South Africa in May 2007. This agreement is expected to
contribute to building an institutional foundation for reinforcing energy
cooperation between the two countries as well as for securing stable energy
sources from South Africa. Furthermore, Korean companies in South Africa will
be propelled to invest in resource development projects. In the meanwhile,
Korea is pursuing an agreement on nuclear energy cooperation with South
Africa to reinforce bilateral cooperation for the peaceful use of nuclear energy
and to advance into South Africa’s nuclear energy market.
Korea also participated three times in negotiating an agreement for an
international joint project called the “FutureGen Project”[28)] which demonstrates
the possibility of commercializing clean energy technology using fossil fuels.
In October 2007, Korea signed a protocol with the European Organization
for Nuclear Research (CERN), the world’s largest particle physics laboratory.
The protocol established frameworks on human resources, financial
management, and institutional arrangements that serve as requirements for joint
research projects.


28) FutureGen Project is an initiative to equip multiple new clean coal power plants of 275MW with
advanced Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology in the U.S. Several other countries such as
Korea, Japan, China and India have been participating in this U.S.-led project.


-----

3) Regional and Global Energy Cooperation

(1) Reinforcing Energy Security in Northeast Asia

On the occasion of the summit among Korea, Japan and China held in
January 2007, the three countries agreed to reinforce trilateral dialogues on
energy security in the region. During the Foreign Ministers Meeting among
three countries in June, they reconfirmed the aforementioned dialogues. Based
on their determination, more specific action plans to build a senior-level energy
consultation mechanism were discussed among them.

(2) Building the Trans-Asian Energy System (TAES)

The Trans-Asian Energy System (TAES) is an integrated energy system to
trade energy across Asia. In August 2007, the Korean government jointly hosted
with the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)
a conference aiming to provide a broad framework for energy cooperation. It is
expected that this system will contribute to not only balancing energy supplies
among energy-supplying countries, but also mediating disputes caused by the
competitive demands of energy-consuming countries.

(3) Participating in Other International Energy Security Mechanisms

The Korean government has actively participated in international energy
security mechanisms, and exerted effort to stabilize the international energy
market and improve its international status as a major energy consumer. The
government has also kept up with updated information regarding the
international energy market through participation in the Council Meeting and
the Standing Group on Long-Term Global Cooperation of the International
Energy Agency (IEA), while also collaborating with non-IEA member countries
such as China, India and Russia. In addition, the government has participated
in regional and interregional energy security dialogues held on the sidelines of


-----

ASEAN+3, APEC, EAS, ASEM and other international meetings.


4) Building Broader Networks for Effective Energy Diplomacy

The government has exerted effort to establish networks with resourcerich countries through technology training programs in the areas of
development and evaluation of mining resources. Fourteen energy experts
from five resource-rich countries[29)] were invited to these programs organized by
KOICA. The government also tried to reinforce energy information networks
providing updated information related to energy sources through the official
web-site of Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Furthermore, the government
reinforced its collaborative relationship with domestic energy organizations
related to energy issues in 2007. For example, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
and Trade participated in the National Energy Committee and in the Meeting
for pan-governmental solutions to high oil prices. Moreover, it hosted three
seminars on energy environment studies, and a joint workshop on advanced
cooperation in the nuclear field with the Ministry of Science and Technology.


5) Cooperation for New and Renewable Energy

The government has been involved in international cooperation to
develop and promote new and renewable energy. For instance, it hosted an
international Bioenergy seminar, participated in the International
Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project, and reinforced
cooperation with Germany, which is an advanced country in renewable energy
technology. Furthermore, the government has been reviewing joining the
establishment of an International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).


29) Myanmar (2), Bangladesh (4), Azerbaijan (3), Tazikstan (1), Congo (4)

###### 2. Adoption of the Bali Roadmap and Environmental Cooperation

1) Climate Change Conference in Bali

In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released
the fourth Assesment Report on Climate Change, and former U.S. VicePresident Al Gore and the IPCC were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. These
consecutive events have intensified and brought out unprecedented global
attention to climate change issue. Against all these backdrops, the “13[th]

Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change and concurrently 3[rd] Conference of Parties to the Kyoto Protocol”
(hereafter, Bali Conference) was held in Bali, Indonesia on December 3-15, 2007.

United Nations Climate Change Conference
(Bali, December 12, 2007)

In this conference, the so-called “Bali Roadmap”was adopted for the
purpose of designing a framework to tackle climate change. This roadmap is to
envisage how climate change issues should be dealt with, globally after the first


-----

commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2008-2012). In other words, the
roadmap unveiled international negotiation schemes for the post-2012 regime
and is evaluated to serve as the groundwork for global partnerships, since all
major Green-House Gas (GHG) emitting countries - including developed and
developing countries such as the U.S., China, and India, which were previously
not bound to mitigation obligations - were involved in forming the
comprehensive Post-2012 regime.
Firstly, the Bali conference concluded that the “Ad-hoc Working Group to
the Long-term Cooperative Actions under United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change”would hold four meetings in 2008. It mainly
aims to debate imperative issues such as the global long-term goal of
mitigation, evaluation of the adaptation priorities for developing countries, the
transfer and diffusion of climate-friendly technology, and financial assistance to
developing countries.
Taking into account the facts elaborated in the fourth IPCC report, all the
parties at the conference made a broad convergence that developed countries
need to at least reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 25% to 40% by 2020
compared to 1990 levels. Regarding the second review of the Kyoto Protocol, a
variety of issues were decided to be addressed: additional assistance to the
adaptation efforts by developing countries, procedures to join the Kyoto
Protocol Annex B countries, ways and means to enhance an equitable regional
distribution of clean development mechanism (CDM) projects and other issues
identified.
In addition, a variety of measures were formulated to induce developing
countries to join the post-2012 regime. These measures yielded tangible results
such as the agreement to establishment of a operational entity for an Adaptation
Fund, technological transfer, and assistance for coping with forest issues.


-----

2) Enhancing Environmental Cooperation

(1) Enhancing Environmental Cooperation in Northeast Asia

Due to high population densities, rapid economic growth and geographical
adjacency, Northeast Asia faces even more serious environmental problems
such as dust sandstorms (DSS), acid rain and marine pollution. In addition, as
environmental problems can cast negative effects on other neighboring
countries, this region needs various cooperative efforts at both bilateral and
multilateral levels.
At the 12[th] Meeting of the Joint Committee on Environmental Cooperation
between Korea and China held in June 2007, both parties agreed to cooperate
in dealing with DSS and worked out a cooperative research plan to deal with
heavily polluted water in areas such as Balhae(Bohai) Bay in China and Lake
Shihwa in Korea. Meanwhile, at the 10[th] Meeting of the Joint Committee on
Environmental Cooperation between Korea and Japan in July 2007, the two
sides agreed to come up with measures against marine waste, to establish a
regime on Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) of marine genetic resources and to
review environmental cooperation projects and strengthen new programmes.
In November 2007, for the first time in three years, Korea resumed the Joint
Committee on Environmental Cooperation with Russia, to facilitate bilateral
environmental cooperation and to agree on mutual cooperation in exploiting
Russia’s affluent natural resources.
The 9[th] Tripartite Environment Ministers Meeting (TEMM) among Korea,
Japan and China was held in Japan, in December 2007, and the three parties
exchanged their respective environmental policies and suggested visions for
environmental cooperation in Northeast Asia. In particular, the launch of the
Joint Research Group on DSS Among Korea, China and Japan in September
2007 as a follow-up measure of the 8[th] TEMM played a pivotal role in Northeast
Asia’s DSS mitigation. On top of this, Northeast Asia Forest Network (NEAFN),
which was launched in August 2007 by Korea, China and Mongolia, will
prepare a framework for anti-DSS measures.


-----

Moreover, the Northwest Pacific Action Plan (NOWPAP) member states,
Korea, China, Japan and Russia, hosted an international coast clean event and a
workshop on marine waste in Busan in October 2007 as part of cooperative
projects for diminishing marine waste. At the 12[th] Inter-Governmental Meeting
held in China, NOWPAP member countries agreed that NOWPAP would
expand its activities to include land based ocean pollution and integrated ocean
sewage management, by strengthening the role of four regional operation
centers. On December 7, 2007, the Hebei Spirit oil spill caused much damage
in Korean West Coast, but Korea received help through NOWPAP’s mutual aid
system, bringing in 55 tons of oil solvent from China and 10 tons from Japan.
Meanwhile, Korea made diplomatic efforts to play a pivotal role in
environmental cooperation in Northeast Asia, including circulating a proposal
for inviting the North-East Asia Sub-regional Programme for Environment
Cooperation (NEASPEC) to set up its secretariat in Inchon. In addition, Korea
concluded a Trust Fund Creating Agreement with United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP) in November 2007 to improve devastating environmental
conditions in North Korea.
Environmental cooperation in Northeast Asia is expected to intensify
through the aforementioned cooperation mechanisms. In order to enhance
efficiency in environmental cooperation, it is necessary to take action in
reinforcing functions of each consultative body and creating a comprehensive
entity that can cover the scattered collaborating sectors.

(2) Enhancing Global Environmental Cooperation


Global environmental issues cover widespread sectors, ranging from the
atmosphere, the eco-system, the marine environment to hazardous waste and
chemical substances. Some 160 environmental agreements have come into effect
under the UN and the UNEP in order to address environmental challenges.
Currently, Korea actively participates in global efforts to deal with global
environmental challenges by joining more than 50 Multilateral Environmental


-----

Agreements (MEAs). In efforts that concern the atmosphere, Korea is engaged
in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the
Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer. Concerning
the eco-system, Korea is a part of the Convention on Biological Diversity, the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and
Flora, the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, the Waterfowl
Habitat (known as the Ramsar Convention) and the UN Convention to Combat
Desertification. Related to protecting the marine environment, Korea is engaged
in the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of
Wastes and Other Matter (London Convention) and the International
Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Cooperation (OPRC).
In dealing with issues concerning chemicals and waste, Korea takes part in the
Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, and the Rotterdam
Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure.
In particular, Korea will stand shoulder to shoulder with the most
environmentally-conscious country groups by successfully hosting the 10[th]

Conference of the Parties of Ramsar Convention in October 2008 in ChangWon. Roughly 2,000 environment experts will gather from 140 member
countries, environment-related international organizations and NGOs.
The potential threats brought about by Living Modified Organisms (LMOs) to
the environment and human health could be effectively managed as the “Bio
Safety Protocol”was ratified in October 2007 and came into effect in January 2008.
In addition, an international cooperation framework was settled to address all
kinds of marine pollution accidents since Korea signed the OPRC-HNS protocol in
December 2007. The protocol is the revised and advanced form of the former
OPRC Convention which collaborated international efforts to tackle oil spills.
Korea has also strived to address global environmental issues by actively
participating in international environment organizations such as the United
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Commission for Sustainable
Development (UNCSD) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF).

###### Chapter 3 Trade Relations with Major Trade Partners

 1. ROK-U.S. Trade Relations


Since the establishment of trade relations between Korea and the U.S., the
bilateral economic exchange has consistently grown, reaching approximately
$83 billion in 2007. The U.S. is Korea’s third largest trading partner after China
and the EU, and Korea is the U.S.’seventh-biggest trading partner.

ROK-U.S. Trade Relations in 2007

|Export|ROK $45.77 billion|U.S. $37.22 billion|
|---|---|---|
|Major Export Items|Electrical and electronic appliances, automobiles, machinery, steel products|Semiconductors, DRAM manufacturing equipments, aircraft & aircraft parts|
|Investment|$4.38 billion|$2.34 billion|
|Accumulated Investment|$25.4 billion (1968-2007)|$39.0 billion (1962-2007)|


(Source: The Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy, The Export-Import Bank of Korea, Korea International Trade Association)

Korea’s exports to the U.S. in 2007 amounted to approximately $45.8
billion, or 12.3% of the country’s total exports in the year, with strong sales of
electrical and electronic appliances, automobiles, machinery, and steel products
within the United States. Meanwhile, U.S. exports to Korea reached $37.2
billion, or 3% of total U.S. overseas sales in 2007. Major U.S. export items
included semiconductors, DRAM manufacturing equipments, aircraft and
aircraft parts. Korea is the sixth largest market for U.S. agricultural and poultry
exports. The U.S. exported to Korea agricultural and poultry products worth

Despite a continued increase in trade and investment between Korea and the
U.S., Korea’s trade dependency on the U.S. has declined in recent years due to a
surge in trade with China in both Korea and the U.S., as well as a fall in the U.S.
market share of Korean products.
Nevertheless, since the U.S. is still the biggest economy in the world in terms
of GDP, with a total annual import of $2.3 trillion as of 2007, it remains one of
Korea’s most important trade partners. Korea signed a free trade agreement with the
U.S. on June 30, 2007, following a series of negotiations since February 3, 2006, with
an aim of enhancing the competitiveness of Korean products in the U.S. and
facilitating foreign investment.

Along with the Korea-U.S. FTA negotiations, the resumption of U.S. beef
imports to Korea arose as one of the major trade issues between the two
countries. In January 2006, Korea allowed resumption of U.S. boneless beef
imports from cattle under 30 months of age, following a ban lasting several
years since the December 2003 outbreak of Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy (BSE) in the U.S. Classified as a “controlled risk”country for
BSE by the OIE in May 2007, the United States has been requesting the opening
of Korea’s market to U.S. beef from cattle of all ages. However, due to bone
fragments found in several shipments of U.S. beef exported to Korea in 2006,
Korea had closed its market to U.S. beef.

###### 2. Korea-Japan Trade Relations

Trade and economic relations between Korea and Japan have progressed
rapidly since the two countries established diplomatic ties. Institutional
cooperation in many areas such as investment, social security, and customs
clearance has helped the two countries maintain stable relations. Although
bilateral trade volume temporarily decreased in 2001, it has been expanding
since 2002 and hit a record high of $82.62 billion in 2007. Japan is Korea’s third
largest trading partner after China and the U.S. Korea is also Japan’s third
largest trading partner.
However, Korea has never achieved a trade surplus with Japan since the
two countries established diplomatic ties in 1965. In 2007, Korea’s trade deficit
reached approximately $30 billion. In order to alleviate this adverse condition,
the government is making relevant policies as well as building infrastructure so
that Korean companies can develop their technologies and improve their
competitive edge. The government is also making effort to promote
cooperation in the materials and components industry, which is the main cause
of the Korea-Japan trade imbalance, and to encourage an increase in Japanese
investments in Korea.

In order to maintain and further develop trade and economic relations,
the two countries resumed the Korea-Japan High-Level Economic Consultation
in Tokyo in December 2006 and held the sixth meeting in Seoul in July 2007.

###### 3. Korea-China Trade Relations

Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1992, Korea and China
have made remarkable progress in numerous fields such as politics, diplomacy
and culture, and even formed a comprehensive and cooperative partnership in
2004. The most noticeable improvements in the bilateral relationship can be
seen in the field of economy and trade. Korea-China trade volume increased by
approximately 25% annually from 1992 to 2007. In 2007, trade volume reached
$145 billion, which was 2280% of 1992’s trade volume of $6.4 billion.
China has become Korea’s largest export market since 2003, and Korea’s
biggest trade partner since 2004. Conversely, Korea has become China’s third
largest trade partner (excluding Hong Kong and Taiwan).

With trade volume between the two countries exceeding $100 billion for
the first time in 2005, Korea and China agreed to work toward a trade volume
of $200 billion by 2012. With the rapid increase in trade volume, Korea’s trade
surplus reached $23.3 billion in 2005, $20.9 billion in 2006 and $19 billion in
2007. Regarding Korea’s surplus (China’s deficit towards Korea), Korea and
China share the view that trade balance should be gradually pursued while
continuously enlarging the bilateral trade volume. In this regard, Korea has
constantly made effort to alleviate the trade imbalance in bilateral trade with
China by dispatching “buy Chinese products”missions and research teams into
the Great West Development of China.
In terms of investment, China has become Korea’s top foreign investment
market since 2002. Korea’s investment into China reached $33.44 billion
(totalling 18,042 cases) at the end of 2007. There were 4.82 million visitors
between the two countries in 2006 and 5.85 million in 2007, airline companies
servicing more than 830 flights a week between Korea and China in 2007.

Moreover, Korea and China adopted the Joint Study Report on the Vision for
Korea-China Economic and Trade Cooperation at a November 2005 summit, as a
means of further developing bilateral economic and trade relations in the mid- and
long- terms. The two countries agreed to make mutual efforts to implement the
Report as smoothly as possible.
As the bilateral economic and trade relations between Korea and China rapidly
developed, various trade issues came to the fore. The two countries have strived to
develop mutual understanding and cooperation through ministerial consultations
such as Korea-China summit talks, trade ministers’meetings, economic ministers’
meetings, the Industrial Cooperation Committee, and the Investment Cooperation
Committee. In addition, the two countries have successfully resolved some of the
pending trade issues in the fields of food hygiene security, quality supervision,
inspection and quarantine, and the protection of intellectual property rights.
Moreover, by launching the high-level Consultation Mechanism for Quality
Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine and the Early Warning System under the
Consultation in January 2006 and by regularizing it as an annual channel after the
second meeting in March 2007, the two countries have successfully prevented trade
conflicts in food safety.
Korea expects to continue developing smooth bilateral economic and trade
relations through mutual visits and friendly cooperation between nation leaders as
well as high and working level officials in the future.

###### 4. Korea-EU Trade Relations

The EU is the world’s largest single market, consisting of 27 member
countries with a population of 490 million as of 2006. Its rising importance in
the international political economy has been exponential. The importance of
Korea-EU trade relations has been strengthened, both in terms of trade volume
and in terms of trade quality.
Cooperation between Korea and the EU has developed along with the
rise in total trade volume since 2001. Between 2001 and 2007, bilateral trade
grew astonishingly at an annual average rate of 18%, with total volume
quadrupling from $4.7 billion to $19.1 billion. Moreover, the EU now
immediately follows China as Korea’s second largest trade partner. Korea’s
trade with the EU alone accounts for approximately 12.7% of total Korean trade
and the EU has become Korea’s second largest export destination after China
and the fourth largest import destination after Japan, China and the U.S. Among
non-EU trade partners, Korea was the sixth largest import country and the ninth
largest export country to the EU in November 2007.

In terms of total investment, the EU ranks as the largest investor in Korea with
$4.3 billion in investment in 2007 alone and an aggregate sum of $44.8 billion.
Meanwhile, total Korean investment in the EU reached $16.6 billion in 2007.
The Korean government has selected the EU as a potential long-term FTA
partner alongside China and the U.S., following its August 2003 “FTA Roadmap.”
After the two rounds of FTA preparatory talks in 2006, negotiations for a Korea-EU
FTA started in May 2007 and five rounds of negotiations were held that year.
Meanwhile, on June 1, 2007, the 6[th] Korea-EU joint committee was held in Brussels,
serving as the momentum to promote mutual understanding and cooperation.
Bilateral trade issues and other issues in the area of economy and policy,
cooperation in industry, environment, science, and technology were discussed in the
meeting.
The Korean government is also holding discussions over bilateral economic
and trade cooperation with each EU member country through various channels. The
outcomes of such efforts in 2007 were as follows: In the Air Transport Meeting
between Korea and France, held in Seoul in January 2007, both parties agreed to
increase capacity and designate multiple airlines between Seoul and Paris. During
President Roh’s official visit to Italy in February 2007, both parties signed the revised
Science Technology Cooperation Agreement and concluded several MOUs in various


-----

fields, such as IT, SME, Industrial Technology, and Aerospace. In addition, the
Agreement on Social Security between Korea and France was enforced in June
2007 and an Agreement on Social Security between Korea and Ireland was
signed in October 2007.

###### 5. Bilateral Countermeasures Against Trade Remedies

In spite of the global trend towards trade liberalization, most clearly
represented by recent WTO multilateral trade negotiations and free trade
agreements, many countries still use trade remedies such as anti-dumping,
countervailing tariffs, and safeguarding to protect their domestic industries.
Cases of remedies against Korean products are also increasing. To cope with
this trend, MOFAT established a Trade Remedy Task Force in September 2000.
The Task Force has been holding active negotiations with investigation
authorities in order to resolve trade remedy problems bilaterally before
resorting to the WTO dispute settlement process, which is usually time
consuming and costly.

The Trade Remedy Task Force makes requests to investigation authorities
for greater self-control and adjustment of excessive trade remedies. In 2007, the
Task Force was dispatched to deal with seven cases in four countries (China,
EU, India and Ukraine) and delivered letters to India, EU, Ukraine and the U.S.
In 2007, as a result of Korea’s persistence in various bilateral negotiations, 31
cases out of a total 43 cases were resolved in favor of Korean companies. A
72.1% success rate demonstrates Korea’s excellent performance in such cases
compared with the average success rate (35.7%) of other countries (China:
28.2%, India: 39.9%, the U.S.: 40.6%).
The most representative success case in 2007 was the U.S.’s anti-dumping
and countervailing investigation of printing paper. In this case, through active
inter-governmental negotiation and close cooperation with the private sector,
the Korean government was able to induce a favorable decision from the U.S.
International Trade Commission, which ruled that Korean printing paper did
not harm U.S. domestic industries.

Furthermore, in the case of EU’s countervailing measures against Hynix
DRAMs, the government implemented various inter-governmental consultations
including negotiations via the Trade Remedy Task Force and the Korea-EU
Trade Minister Summit. As a result, the EU made a final decision which would
terminate its countervailing measures against Hynix DRAMs retroactively from
December 31, 2007. Moreover, as a result of the government’s strenuous efforts
in dealing with Ukraine’s anti-dumping measures against Samsung products
made in China and LG refrigerators, those products received exemption from
anti-dumping regulations.

###### 6. Resolution of Trade Disputes through the WTO Dispute Settlement Procedure

Listed as one of the top countries in terms of trade volume, Korea has
been involved in a large number of international trade disputes. Especially
since the establishment of the WTO, Korea has been actively protecting its trade
interests by using the WTO dispute settlement procedure against unfair trade
practices of its trading partners and against complaints brought against Korea’s
economic system and trade measures. Through the effective use of the WTO
dispute settlement process, the Korean government has contributed to directing
Korea’s trade policy to conform with international trade standards based on the
WTO agreements. Since the establishment of the WTO in January 1995, Korea
has been involved in a total of 24 WTO disputes as of December 2007.


-----

Following favorable Panel and Appellate Body rulings for Korea on the
Japan-DRAMs Countervailing Duty case on Korean Hynix DRAMs, Korea
requested that Japan abolish its countervailing duties against Hynix DRAMs.
Japan is currently in the process of implementing the WTO decision. The
Japan-DRAMs ruling also had a positive effect on the EU interim decision,
which abolished duties on Hynix DRAMs retroactively from December 31,
2007, ensuring Hynix’s share in the European market. In addition, in the case
of Korea Anti-Dumping Duties on Imports of Certain Paper from Indonesia
(Article 21.5 of the DSU), although some recommendations were made
regarding procedures followed by the Korean Trade Commission, most of
Korea’s positions were reflected in the Panel decision regarding the more
substantive matters. Implementation of the Panel recommendations also
provided an opportunity for the Korean government to shape its trade policy to
better conform to international trade standards.
Korea is also guarding against possible violations of its trade interests by
participating as a third party in disputes where indirect interests of the country
are at stake. In 2007 Korea participated as a third party in the following
disputes: Brazil - Measures Affecting Imports of Retreated Tyres (including the
Appellate Body); Turkey - Measures Affecting the Importation of Rice;
European Communities - Anti-Dumping Measure on Farmed Salmon from
Norway; and the United States - Sunset Reviews[30)] of Anti-Dumping Measures
on Oil Country Tubular Goods from Argentina (Article 21.5 of the DSU). Korea
is currently taking part as a third party in seven disputes.
The Korean Government will continue to strive to protect its trade
interests and prevent unreasonable import restrictions of other member
countries through effective use of the WTO dispute settlement procedure.


30) Sunset Review: In the WTO Agreement on Implementation of Article Ⅵof the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade 1994, Article 11.3 states that “Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2,
any definitive anti-dumping duty shall be terminated on a date not later than five years from its imposition
(or from the date of the most recent review under paragraph 2 if that review has covered both dumping
and injury, or under this paragraph), unless the authorities determine, in a review initiated before that date
on their own initiative or upon a duly substantiated request made by or on behalf of the domestic industry
within a reasonable period.”In this article, the word, “review”refers to “Sunset Review.”

###### Chapter 4 WTO DDA and OECD Related Activities

 1. Participation in WTO DDA Negotiations

1) Developments in the DDA Negotiations

The Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) was launched at the fourth WTO Ministerial Conference in
Doha, Qatar in November 2001. The Doha Round was expected to pave the
way for development of the world economy by enhancing credibility of the
multilateral trading system and promoting the predictability and stability of the
world trade order. However, the DDA negotiations proceeded with difficulty,
as major players in the DDA negotiations could not come to an agreement on
key issues: agricultural market access, reduction of agricultural subsidies, and
non-agricultural market access. Furthermore, the DDA Mini-Ministerial Meeting
held in Geneva in June 2006 ended without results, which led to the
suspension of the DDA negotiations in July 2006.
As a result of various efforts[31)] made by WTO members to bring about an
early resumption of the DDA negotiations, the Mini-Ministerial Meeting that was
held in Davos, Switzerland in January 2007 served as a stepping stone to the
resumption of the Geneva-based multilateral process.


31) In particular, Korea, as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the multilateral trading system, is fully aware of
the negative impact that a prolonged suspension of the DDA negotiations could have on trade
liberalization, and has consequently made various efforts to bring about an early resumption of the DDA
negotiations.


-----

2) Negotiations by Sector

(1) Agriculture


With the resumption of the DDA negotiations in early 2007, the
agricultural negotiations proceeded under a two track approach: G-4 (the U.S.,
EC, Brazil and India) group talks and the Geneva-based multilateral process.
The G-4 group focused its negotiations on core issues such as the total amount
of subsidies of the United States and the market access level of importing
countries including the EU. The market access level is measured according to
tariff reduction rates and the level of tariff rate quota expansion. However, the
G-4 Ministerial meeting held in Potsdam, Germany in June 2007 failed to
produce a consensus among the major players, which led to the suspension of
G-4 negotiations.
In spite of the deadlock of the G-4 negotiations, the multilateral talks
continued in Geneva. In July 2007, Ambassador Crawford Falconer, the Chair
of the agriculture negotiating group, circulated a draft text including modalities
reflecting the progress in Geneva. In the draft text, the chair suggested that
tariffs should be classified into four tiers based on their level and that the tariff
reduction rate of the top band be 66-73% for developed countries and 44-49%
for developing countries. In addition, the text offered flexibilities for developed
countries to designate as much as 4-6% of tariff lines as eligible for sensitive
products, which are allowed to deviate from the standard reduction formula.
He also suggested that the United States reduce its trade-distorting subsidies to
a total sum of $13-16.5 billion. With regard to Special Product (SP), the subject
of high concern to Korea and other developing countries, no specific measure
was presented in the text. However, the Chair called for further discussion on
the topic and reiterated his position that tariff cuts around 10-20% upon 5-8% of
tariff lines would be reasonable.
In the second half of 2007, intense multilateral negotiations were
undertaken based on the chair’s draft. Korea and other WTO member countries
actively participated in the intra-and inter-group meetings to have their


-----

positions reflected in the chair’s revised text. Nevertheless, as members were
unable to narrow their differences on outstanding issues, the negotiations were
extended to 2008.
Korea made continued efforts to have its position reflected in the Genevabased multilateral negotiations by seeking greater cooperation with like-minded
countries such as the G10[32)] and G33.[33)] In particular, Korea actively
participated in the G33 meetings by offering various inputs on the issue of
Special Product and an analysis on the state of play, thus helping to solidify
common ground among G33 countries.

(2) Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA)

Since the WTO member countries agreed to resume the DDA
negotiations in January 2007, five rounds of NAMA negotiations were held by
the first half of 2007. Members discussed core issues regarding the tariff
reduction formula, flexibilities for developing countries, and unbound tariff
lines as well as other issues such as non-tariff barriers (NTB) and sectoral
liberalization.
In July 2007, Ambassador Don Stephenson, the chair of the negotiating
group on non-agricultural market access, circulated draft modalities on NAMA
and WTO members had more in-depth negotiations based on the draft. As the
chair’s text proposed tariff reductions that would bring tariff rates below 8-9%
for developed countries and below 19-23% for developing countries,
developed and developing member countries expressed sharply divided views
on the tariff reduction ranges. In addition, there was no convergence of views
on the additional flexibilities that would be provided for developing countries.
In the three consecutive rounds of negotiations held in the second half of
2007, little progress was achieved on the entire issue in NAMA negotiations due


32) The coalition of agricultural importing countries including Korea, Japan, Switzerland, Norway, Israel and
other countries
33) Also called “Friends of Special Products”in agriculture, comprised of developing countries such as
Korea, India, Indonesia, and the Philippines


-----

to wide differences of opinion between developed and developing countries
on such core issues as the tariff reduction rate and additional flexibilities.
Non-agricultural goods outnumber agricultural goods in terms of tariff
lines and trade volume, and have positive ripple effects on a country’s industrial
structure and economic development via freer trade. Taking this into account,
Korea has actively engaged in the NAMA negotiations to reflect its assertive
interests and intensified its cooperation with other like-minded countries with a
view to moving the negotiations forward.

(3) Services


The services negotiations were conducted five times in 2007, including
two plurilateral request-offer negotiations[34)] in April and September. Among 21
plurilateral negotiation groups for various service sectors, Korea participated as
a requesting member in ten service sectors that included maritime,
telecommunication and financial services sectors. Korea also participated as a
requested member in nine sectors that included legal, audiovisual, and air
transportation services sectors. Based on the revised offers submitted in 2005,
WTO members continued to engage in the bilateral and plurilateral
negotiations, exchanging their positions on requests and offers.
Along with the request-offer negotiations, WTO members have also
actively engaged in negotiations to establish new service rules on domestic
regulations. Such new rules aim to ensure that members’domestic regulations
on services are reasonable under the multilateral system. WTO members are
currently holding negotiations based on the chairman’s draft text submitted in
April 2007.
The service industry is a new driving force for the Korean economy and
its development is instrumental especially in enhancing competitiveness of the


34) The plurilateral request-offer negotiation is a negotiation structure that brings together members that
demand market access and members that are being requested to open up their markets. This
negotiation method reinforces the traditional bilateral request-offer method as the requested members
are placed under greater pressure from multiple sources, rather than one member, to liberalize their
services market.


-----

manufacturing sector. In this vein, the Korean government has actively
participated in the service negotiations to enhance the competitiveness of the
Korean economy and facilitate inroads of domestic industries into foreign
markets. In particular, Korea has focused on five infrastructural services maritime, construction, telecommunication, distribution, and financial services over which the government has exerted continuous efforts to expand
liberalization of services markets.

(4) Others

Negotiations in other areas included trade facilitation, development/
implementation, intellectual property rights and the environment. In rules
negotiations, Korea, as a member of the Friends of Anti-dumping Negotiations,
tried to address the negative impacts of anti-dumping measures. Since the
submission of the Chair’s consolidated text in November 2007, Korea has
intensified its cooperation with other like-minded countries in an attempt to
move the negotiations forward and to reflect its position in the Geneva-based
multilateral negotiations. Korea also took the position that subsidies on fisheries
should be prohibited only when the fisheries management system fails to
prevent over-capacity and overfishing.
In the field of intellectual property rights, major issues included protection
of Geographical Indications (GI) and the relationship between the Agreement
on Trade Related Aspect of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) and
the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Korea participated in meetings
of Council for TRIPS held in February, June and October of 2007 as well as in
several informal meetings and consultations, focusing on protecting the
interests of domestic industries.
The protection system for Geographical Indications (GI) of goods is a
system designed to protect producers and consumers by identifying the origin
of goods when quality, reputation or other characteristics are attributable to its
geographical origin. Countries including the EU have sought to extend the
protection of GI provided for in Article 23 of the TRIPS Agreement to products


-----

other than wines and spirits. In addition, they have strongly advocated the
establishment of a multilateral system for notification and registration of GI that
would lead to binding protection in all member states. However, the U.S. and
other WTO members continue to oppose the extension of GI protection and
the application of binding effects in the multilateral system, resulting in a
deadlock in the negotiations.
As for negotiations on the relationship between the TRIPS Agreement and
the CBD, little progress was made due to the conflicting views between
developing and developed countries. The former argued that it would be
necessary to amend the TRIPS agreement to accommodate the CBD, which
recognizes the sovereign right of its Contracting Parties over their genetic
resources. By contrast, the latter maintained that such an amendment would be
unnecessary.
The development/implementation negotiating group focused on 88
agreement-specific proposals submitted by developing country members to
strengthen the content and efficacy of the special and differential treatment
(S&DT) provisions for developing countries under the WTO agreements.
However, there was no substantial progress in negotiations concerning the
S&DT provisions, unlike other areas such as agriculture, NAMA and Services.
In the trade and the environment negotiations, six special and three
regular sessions of the Committee were held in 2007. The main issues of the
negotiations were ①the relationship between the WTO rules and Specific
Trade Obligations (STO) set out in the Multilateral Environmental Agreements
(MEAs), ②procedures for information exchange between MEA Secretariats and
the relevant WTO committees, and the criteria for granting observer status, and
③the reduction or, as appropriate, the elimination of tariff and non-tariff
barriers to environmental goods and services.
As for the issues concerning the WTO-MEA relationship, discussions have
been pursued based on the proposals submitted by Members. With respect to
the information exchange and the criteria for granting observer status, a
consultation process on Elements of a Draft Text has been undertaken. As for
trade liberalization in environmental goods and services, no agreement has


-----

been reached as to what products should be covered under the category of
environmental goods because of divergence between developed and
developing countries on solutions. In order to find a way forward, it was
tentatively agreed that a combined approach would be pursued, integrating the
positive aspects of various approaches proposed by Members.
Negotiations for trade facilitation focused on simplification of customs
procedures by improving GATT Articles V, VIII, and X. This was intended to
establish a new set of WTO rules which would lead to a reduction in
transaction costs and improvement in the climate for trade. Korea, as a member
of the Colorado Group[35)] together with the U.S., Japan, EC, Canada, Australia,
Switzerland and other developed countries, continued to take a leading role in
the negotiations. During the negotiations, held eight times in total in 2007
alone, Korea submitted three revised proposals on customs procedures: a
“ single window,” which means one-time submission of data and
documentation for the same transaction; publication of time required for
Customs release of goods; and risk-management measures. Furthermore, Korea
actively expressed its position on other Members’proposals to negotiate
outcomes favorable to Korea. In the meanwhile, some progress has been made
on the issue of technical assistance and capacity building for developing
countries, which has been another key issue in the negotiations, considering
that specific discussions have begun in order to come up with a common
mechanism to implement such programs.

3) Korea’s Performance in the Negotiations

With the resumption of the DDA negotiations in early 2007, Korea made
greater efforts at bilateral as well as multilateral meetings for the successful


35) The Colorado Group, organized in the process of preparing for the 1999 ministerial meeting in Seattle,
is a group which supports the adoption of a new WTO agreement on trade facilitation. It is composed
of Korea, the U.S., EC, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Norway, Chile, Hong
Kong, Singapore, Costa Rica, Colombia, Paraguay, and Morocco.


-----

conclusion of the negotiations. Korea played a leading role in seeking a
balanced outcome across the board by actively participating in various highlevel official and minister-level meetings, including the initiative leading to the
special statement on the DDA adopted at the APEC Leader’s Meeting.
Furthermore, the Korean government has actively collaborated with likeminded countries as a member of several issue-oriented groups to efficiently
reflect its positions on the negotiations and their outcomes. More specifically,
Korea worked as a member of the importing group as well as of the
developing country group in the agriculture talks. Korea also belongs to the
group supporting the expansion of market liberalization in NAMA and services
as well as the group continuously calling for the improvement of the WTO antidumping agreement.
In addition, the Korean government has actively sought to reconcile
conflicting domestic interests through coordination among relevant ministries
and extensive dialogue with interest groups. Furthermore, the government
made efforts to foster greater public understanding of the WTO negotiations
process through various outreach activities.


###### 2. Participation in OECD Projects and Activities

Member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) share and analyze their best practices to develop sound
regulatory frameworks. As one of the leading research bodies on globalization,
the OECD seeks ways to maximize the benefits of globalization from diverse
fields such as finance, trade, the environment, social welfare and development,
while minimizing the costs involved.



- nstitutional Progress through the OECD
In 2007, Korea made substantial institutional progress with the support of
the OECD. The OECD Review of Regulatory Reform in Korea: Progress in
Implementing Regulatory Reform released in March concluded that Korea


-----

made significant progress in its regulatory policies, shifting emphasis from a
quantitative reduction of the overall stock of regulations to the pursuit of
regulatory quality. It also noted that regulatory procedures were simplified.
In addition, in June 2007, the OECD declared the termination of labour
monitoring in Korea which had been conducted since Korea’s accession to the
OECD in 1996. This declaration officially recognized the fact that Korea’s
legislation and institutions on labour affairs met international standards.

- ustainable Economic Development through the OECD
The OECD Economic Survey of June 2007 evaluated the Korean
economy’s current status and sought measures to facilitate its future growth.
Although Korea’s economy has managed to maintain a relatively high annual
growth rate of 4.3%, the OECD expressed its concern that the structural
weaknesses of the Korean economy such as a widening income gap, may take
place and that the rapidly aging population may dampen its future growth. The
survey highlighted the need to dissolve structural deterrents to Korea’s
economic growth and identify measures for sustainable growth.

- reater Participation in the OECD’s Activities in Formulating International
Economic Regulations
Korea made an effort to establish itself as a middle power of the OECD.
Korea’s focus in the past was on learning and emulating the best practices of
the OECD member countries. However, this approach is gradually being
replaced by an evolving one in which Korea plays a more active role, widening
its participation in shaping international economic regulations and policies.
The Ministerial Council Meeting was held on May 15-16, 2007 under the
theme of “Innovation: Advancing the OECD Agenda for Growth and Equity.”
During the meeting, Korea presented lessons learned from its recent experience
in negotiating free trade agreements, consequently contributing to developing
policies on balancing growth and equity in a globalized world. Korea also
presented its policies in promoting innovation in research and development


-----

and in protecting intellectual property rights.
The international celebration of the tenth anniversary of the OECD AntiBribery Convention, hosted jointly by the Government of Italy and the OECD in
Rome in November 2007, catalyzed the OECD’s deliberations on the
Convention’s future. On this occasion, Korea presented its achievements in
implementing the Convention and actively contributed to the collaborative
efforts of spreading the impact of the Convention.
Korea also took part in the OECD-MENA (Middle East and North Africa)
Ministerial Council Meeting which was held in Cairo, Egypt on November 2829, 2007. Korea sought to find its role in improving the region’s public
administration and investment climate as part of an overall effort in
strengthening cooperation between Korea and non-OECD member states in the
region.
In the meantime, OECD’s internal management and organizational issues
were areas in which Korea focused on intensifying its involvement. As an active
participant in the OECD enlargement discussions, which would greatly
influence the future of the OECD, Korea provided its support in adopting the
Accession Roadmap in the November 2007 Council Meeting. Furthermore,
Korea’s ambassador was elected as the Chair of the Audit Committee in
December 2007.

- ncreasing Domestic Support for the OECD
The Korean public’s awareness on the OECD grew significantly in the
year 2007. The OECD Online Information Service (OLIS) Workshop was held in
Seoul in September 2007, providing Korean experts from government agencies,
research institutions and universities with information on how to gain better
access to the OECD-internet based information system.
Presentations on the OECD Human Resource Management, organized in
Seoul in November and in Paris in December, attracted highly qualified Korean
students and experts from diverse sectors and provided a forum to discuss ways
to increase Korea’s representation within the OECD Secretariat.

###### Chapter 5 Diplomacy to Promote Trade and Foreign Investment

 1. Attracting Foreign Investment

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) generates positive outcomes for the host
country’s economy such as increased output, employment creation, expanded
exports and transfer of relevant technology and management know-how in the
recipient industries. Statistics show that as of the end of 2005, FDI companies
accounted for 11% of output, 7% of employment and 14% of exports in the
Korean economy, with these numbers continually on the rise. However,
according to UNCTAD, the average accumulated FDI to GDP of each country
in the world in 2006 was 24.8%, and that of developed countries 24.2%, while
Korea recorded a much lower 8.0%.

Recognizing the importance of FDI, the Korean government has taken
various measures to attract foreign investment, striving to improve the domestic
investment environment as well as to create favorable conditions for investment
and promote greater open investment policies overseas.
The FDI committee and Invest Korea play a major role in order to
increase FDI inflow. MOFAT has also participated in these efforts, in particular

striving to resolve difficulties faced by FDI companies and overseas publicizing
of improvements in domestic institutions. MOFAT will continue to implement
these activities in order to promote FDI into Korea, including increasing
overseas PR and concluding FTAs and BITs.


###### 2. Supporting Overseas Business Activities

Diplomatic missions abroad are actively promoting the growth of
domestic businesses overseas by building bridges between foreign
governments and Korean businesses that have already expanded abroad or are
planning to do so. The pan-governmental Action Plan for Supporting Overseas
Business Activities was announced in February 2007 in order to revitalize the
national economy by making overseas expansion a new economic momentum.
Since the announcement, MOFAT has strengthened the activities of the Trade
and Investment Promotion Teams, which have been operating in diplomatic
missions worldwide. One of the most remarkable steps by MOFAT was the
establishment of the Triangle Cooperative System, which includes MOFAT,
foreign governments, and the Korean business community, to help resolve
trade disputes and the difficulties facing Korean companies. In 2008, MOFAT
initiated the Legal Advisory Service in some major diplomatic missions abroad
to provide legal service for small and medium sized enterprises experiencing
difficulties in employing their own lawyers or contracting consulters. This
Service is expected to prevent difficulties that Korean companies may
experience abroad and to further provide substantial support for overseas
business activities.
The Korean government is also supporting the efforts of domestic small
and medium enterprises (SMEs) to develop new global markets, expand
overseas markets, and facilitate overseas business activities. In order to establish
a system favorable to the private sector, MOFAT has signed MOUs with the
Federation of Korean Industries, the Korea Chamber of Commerce and


-----

Industry, the Korea Federation of Small and Medium Business, the Korea
International Trade Association and the International Contractors Association of
Korea since 2004.[36)] After a series of efforts made by the government to create
awareness of new markets among domestic business communities, a UN
Procurement Service Seminar was held twice in 2007 in order to clarify the
procurement process of the UN and its agencies, thereby aiding the expansion
of Korean businesses into the UN Procurement market.[37)] To further aid
participating companies, MOFAT arranged one-on-one meetings between
business heads and officials from the UN Procurement Division. MOFAT also
provides useful information to businesses on government policies, legal
regulations and market information of foreign countries.
In order to build a collective vision for business partnership and mutual
development as well as to receive feedback, MOFAT organizes a periodical
consultative meeting for economic organizations. The meeting offers a forum
for the government to explain major economic and trade policies, as well as for
the business community to express and exchange views with the government.
Various business opinions suggested in the meeting have been reflected in
MOFAT’s economic and trade policies.
To further aid the private sector, especially in the area of agricultural
products,[38)] MOFAT signed an MOU with the Ministry of Agriculture and
Forestry on April 26, 2007 to help find overseas markets for Korean agricultural
goods through diplomatic missions abroad. According to the MOU, seven
overseas missions, namely in France, Germany, Japan, China, L.A., Shanghai,


36) MOUs have been signed with five private-sector economic organizations. MOUs were concluded with
the Federation of Korean Industries and Korea International Trade Association in 2004 and the Korea
Federation of Small and Medium Business and the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry in 2005.
Most recently, the International Contractors Association of Korea entered into an MOU with MOFAT on
July 18, 2007.
37) The ROK supplied $32 million worth of goods to the UN procurement market in 2006, which
accounted for only 0.35% of the total procurement amount of $94 billion, and relatively minute in
comparison to the scope of Korea’s contribution to the UN budget ($43 million in 2007, 2.173% of the
UN budget, placing Korea at 11[th] place in terms of contribution).
38) Korea exported $2.3 billion worth of agricultural goods. Of the total, fresh produce accounted for $540
million and processed foods accounted for $1.75 billion in 2007. Agricultural exports accounted for
around 1 percent of the country’s exports in 2006.

and Qingdao, held promotional events for Korean agricultural goods along
with cultural projects in 2007.
Moreover, in order to lay the groundwork for the support of overseas
activities of Korean enterprises and diversification of export markets, the
government has been dispatching the Joint Public and Private Sector Trade
Delegation since 1998, in cooperation with local governments and private
economic organizations.

Under this system of cooperation between the public and private sectors,
a total of 11 joint delegations were dispatched in 2007[39)] to prominent
international exhibitions and trade fairs, including the New York Trade Fair and
the Beijing Hi-Tech IT Industry Exchange. These events offered valuable
opportunities for export contracts and the forging of ties among firms.
In an effort to support SMEs, the government also commenced a strategic
consortium, which aims to provide new market opportunities to technologyoriented SMEs and to foster an exchange of business ideas between the
companies and a variety of experts, focusing on expansion into new markets.
Discussions ranged from marketing and legal issues to funding. As a result, 45
SMEs made inroads into emerging markets such as India, Vietnam, Singapore
and the United Arab Emirates.


39) The delegation was dispatched to 130 countries from 1998 to 2007.

###### 3. Providing Information on Economy and Trade Issues

MOFAT is doing its utmost to meet the demands of the business
community by providing the latest information on economy and trade issues
reported from diplomatic missions worldwide. The reports, which include
information on development projects, government procurement as well as
information on tenders, are swiftly conveyed to relevant ministries, economic
organizations and companies through an e-mailing service. The latest
information is also accessible on the MOFAT website.
Moreover, a cyber service that provides useful information for businesses
was launched in December 2001 and was made available on overseas
missions’websites. On the website, the government also offers customeroriented one-on-one consulting services to address the concerns of businesses.
In order to provide better services, a cooperative mechanism was established in
2007 between MOFAT and KOTRA. Under the mechanism, KOTRA takes part
in handling inquiries regarding buyer information and product information,
while foreign embassies are in charge of taking inquiries on overseas business
problems, economic/trade policies, legal regulations, and market information.
In 2007, a total of 2,670 inquiries were duly answered.
In addition, the Ministry has published several books on foreign markets,
assisting Korean companies doing business abroad by providing useful
information. A Comprehensive Survey of the Trade Environment - a
compilation of information, research and analysis on the trade environments of
eighty-seven countries - was revised and published in 2007. A Casebook on
Trade & Business Dispute Settlement published in 2007 contains 114 business
dispute cases reported from fifty embassies. These publications offer vital
information for companies considering overseas expansion, as they may face
similar cases.

###### 4. Supporting the City of Yeosu’s Bid to Host the 2012 International Exposition

As the principal Ministry engaged in negotiations for the selection of
Yeosu as the host for the 2012 EXPO, MOFAT set up a Task Force (TF) directed
by the vice Minister on July 28, 2006 to secure Yeosu as the EXPO host.
Through the Yeosu TF, which involved several Director-Generals and Division
Directors, MOFAT engaged in various diplomatic activities by inviting foreign
VIPs to Korea, discussing the matter in economic joint committee meetings and
policy dialogues, and sponsoring domestic and foreign events related to the
Yeosu EXPO. In particular, from early October 2007 to the end of November
2007, MOFAT reviewed the position of each country daily and encouraged
diplomatic negotiation activities.
MOFAT’s diplomatic missions in France and England also set up a Yeosu
TF, negotiating with each country’s representatives for Bureau des International
Expositions (BIE). In particular, the Korean Embassy in France played a major
role in the selection of Yeosu as the host for the EXPO.

The delegation for the City of Yeosu’s World Expo Bidding Committee
arrives at Incheon International Airport (November 28, 2007)


-----

On November 27, 2007, Yeosu was selected to host the 2012 Expo at the
142[nd] General Assembly of BIE after two close rounds of votes by 140 member
countries. In the first round, Korea received 68 votes, followed by Morocco
with 59, and Poland with 13. In the final round, Korea received 77 votes,
defeating Morocco’s 63 votes.
It is believed that the major factors contributing to the victory were active
hosting efforts by close partnership between the public and private sectors,
voluntary support from a global network of private companies, and greater
national strength compared to other competitors. MOFAT also formed a
preemptive and custom-tailored strategy in a bid to promote Yeosu as the
EXPO host, and was able to secure votes from 12 Caribbean countries in
advance as there were no applicants in the region. Furthermore, MOFAT
placed immense diplomatic efforts toward this goal, such as sending Missions at
the Ministerial level. MOFAT’s victory in the diplomatic war is believed to have
been the most important factor in the selection of Yeosu as the EXPO host.

###### Chapter 1 Protecting the Safety and Promoting the Rights of Korean Nationals Abroad

 1. Strengthening Measures to Protect Korean Nationals Abroad

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MOFAT) has established and
consolidated a wide range of consular systems to secure the safety of Korean
nationals abroad.
MOFAT established the Consular Call Center in 2005 as the world’s first
call center designed exclusively to handle consular matters around-the-clock,
and has enhanced its utility through continued improvement of the system and
reinforcement of public relations for the Center. MOFAT also launched the
Rapid Response Team to promptly respond to major emergencies such as
terrorist attacks, incidents, or natural disasters of large scale.
The SMS Alert Service was introduced to inform travelers of deteriorating
security situations outside Korea. Furthermore, campaigns to prevent accidents
and incidents overseas have been carried out by MOFAT via a variety of mass
media channels. In 2007, MOFAT also introduced new systems, the Rapid
Overseas Remittance System and the Consular Assistant System, in a chain of
efforts to strengthen measures to protect Korean nationals abroad.

1) Managing the Consular Call Center

After a four-month test period, the Consular Call Center of MOFAT was
officially launched on April 1, 2005. Since then, the Center has handled a
variety of public inquiries and is still expanding its realm of work.


-----

The number of incoming calls is increasing every year. It has jumped
from 2,000 calls per month when the center was first established, to 17,000 calls
per month or 212,000 calls per year in 2007. Moreover, the center gained public
recognition when it won first place among public call centers on the Korea
Service Quality Index (KSQI) in 2007.
MOFAT will continue to develop innovative services to help stimulate
ongoing improvements made for the welfare of Korean nationals abroad, by
actively adopting and comprehensively integrating various communication
channels such as the Internet, mobile phones, and faxes.

2006/2007 Incoming Calls


2) Dispatch of Rapid Response Teams

In 2007, MOFAT systematically approached terrorism or incidents
threatening the safety of Korean nationals abroad - such as the two abduction
cases in Nigeria in January and May, the sinking of the Golden Rose off the
coast of Dalian in May, and the abduction of Koreans in Afghanistan in July - by
dispatching Rapid Response Teams to the regions in conflict in order to secure
the safety of Korean nationals. In addition, MOFAT has completed successful
tasks to prevent such incidents from occurring in large-scale overseas events

3) Expansion of the Overseas Emergency Alert System (OEAS)

The OEAS was launched on May 2005 to protect Korean nationals
traveling in areas of distress, by text messaging (SMS) emergency information to
users of international roaming services.
Initially, MOFAT provided the OEAS only to SKT Global Roaming Service
users, but has extended this service to KTF Global Roaming Service users as
well since January 2007. Currently, MOFAT provides OEAS to 130 countries and
to an annual average of more than 3 million users worldwide.

4) Introducing the Rapid Overseas Remittance System

The implementation of the Rapid Overseas Remittance System on June 1,
2007 has allowed Korean nationals to enjoy quick international money transfers.
This system provides assistance to Korean travelers who need quick cash due to
robbery, loss of possessions, or other unforeseen accidents. When a traveler
faces emergencies of this nature, a family member (or acquaintance) in Korea
must deposit the amount of money requested by the traveler to the Consular
Call Center’s domestic bank account. Then, the Call Center will inform
diplomatic posts, who will provide the cash directly to the traveler/applicant.


-----

Process Map of Rapid Overseas Remittance System

Abroad Korea

Preexisting international bank transfers not only charge high remittance
fees, but also take a minimum of 2 or 3 days, which may be of substantial
inconvenience to travelers especially under urgent circumstances. In contrast,
the Rapid Overseas Remittance System allows applicants to receive money
transfers within 24 hours of request.
Currently, MOFAT supports approximately 30-40 remittance cases a
month, and in the year 2007 alone, 213 travelers safely completed their trip at
this system’s assistance. In addition, while this system was offered only to
Korean nationals with a stay of less than 2 years abroad, recent amendments
now allow all Korean nationals to use the system, regardless of the length of
their stay abroad.


-----

5) Introducing the Consular Assistant System

MOFAT introduced the Consular Assistant System to expand consular
services to Korean nationals living in areas distant from diplomatic offices with
little access to prompt protection from Korea. The system was put into force on
March 1, 2007, and 100 consular assistants were appointed as of February 2008
to 14 areas that have no diplomatic offices and 86 areas that are far from
diplomatic offices.
The consular assistants’duty is to initiate an early stage response by
following instructions from the consulate in each region.[40)] This system has
enhanced the ability of MOFAT to protect Korean nationals in the following
regions: 27 areas in China (including Wuhan, Harbin, Guilin, and Kunming); 21
areas in the Asia-Pacific region (including Bali and Cebu); 15 areas in Europe
(including Barcelona, Edinburgh, and Albania); 23 areas in America (including
Cuba, Haiti, and Bolivia); and 14 areas in Africa and the Middle East (including
Cape Town and Luxor).


6) Safety Measures for Korean Companies in High-Risk Areas

After the abduction of Daewoo E&C employees by Nigerian armed
groups in January 2007, MOFAT dispatched a safety inspection team comprised
of government officials from relevant departments four times to inspect high
risk areas in which Korean companies were actively involved in. Based on
inspection results, MOFAT has designed safety measures, which have factored
in the distinct characteristics of each region.
Moreover, MOFAT has conducted safety inspections in regions where


40) Consular Assistants are making great contributions by taking initial response in incidents involving
Koreans abroad, as they have lived long enough in the local area to be well informed of the local state
of affairs.

many deep-sea fishing vessels operate under high risk of abduction, and also
endeavored to strengthen cooperation with the International Maritime
Organization. Additionally, in an effort to protect Korean missionaries working
overseas, MOFAT has started training courses on safety and established
emergency networks.

7) The Travel Warning System and Restrictions on Travel to

High-Risk Areas

MOFAT categorizes high-risk areas into four categories according to the
level of risk involved - travel caution, travel refrained, travel restricted, and
travel banned areas - in order to facilitate safe overseas traveling for Korean
nationals.
Furthermore, amendments in regulations concerning the Passport Act
now give MOFAT legal justifications for banning Korean nationals from
traveling to or taking residence in areas of high risk overseas, after conducting a
careful security analysis of the region at issue. Accordingly, MOFAT has
imposed bans on regions of Travel Alert Level 4, specifically Iraq, Somalia, and
Afghanistan, starting from August 7, 2007 to a year thereafter. Nevertheless,
exceptions can be made for entering or staying in these areas under special

circumstances, such as in cases where the people at issue are permanent
residents of the area, or are there for news report purposes, emergent
humanitarian reasons, public affairs, operations for national interest, or
corporation activities, after the reasons for travel and relevant security measures
have been examined thoroughly.


8) Establishment of the Integrated Consular System

MOFAT has reconstituted various programs for protecting Korean
nationals abroad, in efforts to make each step of the process easier for end
users - nationals traveling or staying overseas - to follow, from the first step of
preparing for travel to the final step of returning to Korea. This system is called
the Integrated Consular System, and the system flowchart is depicted in the
diagram below.

###### 2. Promoting the Rights of Overseas Koreans

1) Revitalization of the Committee on Overseas Korean Policy


The Committee on Overseas Koreans Policy was established in 1996, with
the aim to comprehensively review and coordinate policies for overseas
Koreans. At the fourth meeting of the Committee in November 2004, a decision
was made to hold meetings on a regular basis, one or more sessions a year for
the Plenary Committee and two or more sessions a year for the Working
Committee, in order to reinvigorate the Committee. The Committee held
meetings in March and December 2007, and at the 7[th] plenary session held in
March, the Committee designated October 5 as「Korean Day」.[41)]


Ceremony in Commemoration of the 1[st] Korean Day (Seoul, October 5, 2007)


41) The Committee designated October 5 as「Korean Day」and October 4-7 as 「Korean Week」, in order to
show off the mother country’s interest in overseas Koreans, and in hopes of strengthening their
identity and pride in being Koreans. Against this backdrop, the 1[st ]「Korean Day」was held on October
5, 2007, along with various events held throughout the「Korean Week」, such as the overseas Korean
policy seminar, Korean speech contests, and the Korean Festival in Seoul.


-----

By revitalizing the Committee on Overseas Koreans Policy, the Korean
government has coordinated various tasks and support projects involving
overseas Koreans conducted by diverse government agencies. As a result, it is
expected to enhance the efficiency of operations concerning overseas Koreans
policy and further bolster cooperation between various Ministries.

Korean Population and Organizations Overseas


-----

2) Supporting Resettlement of Overseas Koreans in CIS Countries

Approximately 500,000 people of Korean origin are living abroad in the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). After the former Soviet Union
collapsed in 1991, nearly 50,000 of these people left the countries of their
original nationality and are now living illegally or as stateless refugees in CIS
countries, due to the civil war in Tajikistan and economic turmoil in Uzbekistan,
and other various reasons.
In 2006, the Korean government founded the Commission on Overseas
Korean Support for the CIS Region and selected the following as the
Commission’s top 5 priorities: expand opportunities for learning the Korean
language; increase support for students to study or receive training in Korea;
help people to maintain their ethnic and cultural identity; enhance employment
opportunities in Korea; and support efforts to settle down in local areas.
Since late 2005, the Korean government, in efforts to help Koreans
residing in CIS countries under stateless refugee status to resettle, has provided
legal assistance for these people to acquire citizenship, and also endeavored to
enhance diplomatic cooperation with countries of concern such as Russia,
Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. In addition, the Korean government is also
developing agricultural support programs to secure economic independence
for overseas Koreans. Such efforts include dispatching agricultural experts to
Ukraine to construct agricultural training facilities and educate overseas Koreans
in this region, and invite overseas Korean farmers to Korea for agricultural
training.


-----

3) Visiting Employment System for Overseas Koreans Residing
in China and CIS Countries

Overseas Koreans of non-Korean nationality are endorsed by the Law of
the Legal Status of Overseas Koreans, and can enjoy many benefits of living in
Korea, including employment and economic activities. However, this law does
not apply to overseas Koreans working in the manual labor sector.
Consequently, a persistent problem is that overseas Koreans from China and
the CIS countries are in fact deprived of privileges they should receive under
the Law of the Legal Status of Overseas Koreans.
In order to solve this problem, the Korean government has taken
complementary measures to provide Koreans from China and the CIS countries
with more opportunities to visit and work in Korea. For instance, it has
implemented the Employment Management System in December 2002 and the
Special Employment Permit System in August 2004, as alternative means to the
Law of the Legal Status of Overseas Koreans.
In addition, the Visiting Employment System went into effect in March 4,
2007, with an aim to simplify employment procedures by including overseas
Koreans with no domestic ties to Korea, on the list of candidates to visit Korea.
The System is one of the active policies supporting Koreans overseas, by
enabling the issuance of multiple visas with a 5-year validity. Accordingly, it is
expected to help overseas Koreans resettle in their respective countries of
origin, after they return from their visit or employment in Korea.

(2) Major Outcomes of Supporting Overseas Korean Communities

6[th] World Korean Business Convention

The World Korean Business Convention is an off-line event of the Global
Korean Business Network Project, which aims to build a global Korean
business network within various fields - commerce, industry, international
trade, information technology, venture capital, science, and technology - by
interconnecting Korean businessmen and companies from overseas and within
Korea.
Through the global Korean business network, overseas Korean
businessmen can expand their market through exchange of markets, goods,
and information between overseas Korean businessmen from different
continents, countries, and region, and can secure domestic partners or gain
market information by connecting to domestic business networks. Furthermore,
domestic businessmen can overcome language and market information barriers
and expand their realm of involvement overseas through such enhanced
cooperation with overseas Korean companies.
The 6[th] World Korean Business Convention, held in October 2007 in
BEXCO, Busan, was attended by 2,993 persons from 37 countries, and
achieved 4,373 business consultations, resulting in an effective business
accomplishment worth $376 million, a 150% annual increase from $258 million
achieved last year. Through close cooperation with local governments, the
convention hosted the business exhibition in which 368 companies or entities
participated, and 419 booths were established. In particular, since the
convention was held simultaneously with the 2007 Busan Health & Food Expo,
it served as an opportunity to boost the local economy. Moreover, on this
occasion, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Korea
Chamber of Commence and the Industry and Korean business Union of Central
and Southern America was signed to build a cooperation system between
related entities at home and abroad, and to encourage the active participation

of Korean businessmen overseas. Against this backdrop, the convention
became the largest event organized by overseas Korean communities.

Building a Database to Invigorate the Korean Network

The Hanin Directory 2007 was issued in order to build the basis for a
Korean network, uniting the 7 million overseas Koreans into one unified
community. It contains detailed information on 530 Korean associations in 117
different countries, and has categorized the details by country and continent,
for the convenience of Korean nationals in Korea and overseas.


Enhancing Support for Overseas Korean Communities


The Korean government, since the commemoration of the 100[th]

anniversary of Korean settlement in Mexico which was held in 2005, has been
pursuing the Overseas Korean Youth Job Training Program. The Program aims
to foster stable economic activity for the Korean descendants in Mexico and
other Koreans overseas residing in China, Sakhalin, Latin America, and CIS
countries, and to strengthen various exchanges between such descendants and
Korea, the mother country. As a result, 247 persons from China, Latin America,
and CIS countries were given job aptitude training in IT programs (Java and
Web programming), automobile maintenance, and electric welding. The
Korean government also provided IT-related education equipment to national
schools in China and CIS countries. Moreover, by supporting 4,260 million
Korean Won to 2,097 Korean language schools in 109 countries, the
government contributed to maintaining the compatriots’sense of Korean
national identity through Korean language education. Furthermore, it has
invigorated overseas Korean communities by encouraging commemoration
projects in support of Korean immigration, such as the Commemoration for the
70[th] Anniversary of Korean Settlement in CIS Countries.

###### Chapter 2 Improving the Quality of Consular Services

 1. Pursuing the Expansion of Visa Waiver Programs

1) Entry into the U.S. Visa Waiver Program

MOFAT is seeking Korea’s entry into the U.S. Visa Waiver Program
(VWP), in order to facilitate Koreans’visits to the U.S. and to promote personal
exchanges between the two countries. With the aim to enter Korea into the
U.S. VWP, MOFAT has made efforts to keep in contact with the U.S. Congress
and government to establish favorable conditions within the United States.
Meanwhile, MOFAT has also endeavored to satisfy requirements for Korea’s
entry by maintaining close cooperation with other relevant domestic
government agencies.
In December 2006, the two parties agreed on a roadmap for Korea’s entry
into the VWP. U.S. President George W. Bush expressed his support for ROK’s
entry in June 2007, and reiterated his support several times thereafter. In
addition, a bill for modernizing the VWP was passed in the U.S. Congress in
July 2007 and was signed by the U.S. President in August 2007. Such
aforementioned actions have increased the possibility of Korea’s entry into the
U.S. VWP.
In addition to a series of these efforts, both sides have strived to establish
new systems for implementing the VWP, as exemplified in the issuance of
electronic passports by Korea and the introduction of the Electronic System for
Travel Authorization (ESTA) by the U.S.


-----

The 2[nd] Korea-U.S. Consultation Meeting (Seoul, November 6, 2007)


Korea’s entry into the VWP is expected to generate an annual worth of
over 100 billion Korean Won in economic gains, by saving various fees
including visa fees ($131 per person) and cutting opportunity costs in waiting
for visa interviews. Moreover, in the long term, Korea’s participation in the
VWP is expected to work hand in hand with the ROK-U.S. FTA and expand
business opportunities, thereby translating into a new driving force for
economic growth in Korea. In addition, we anticipate subsequent factors to
follow, such as a more mature relationship between ROK and the U.S., and an
enhanced international status of Korean nationals and ROK as a country.


-----

2) Visa Waiver Agreement

More than 13 million Koreans visit foreign countries every year. For the
convenience of Korean nationals visiting foreign countries, MOFAT has signed
the Visa Waiver Agreement with 85 different countries and is also in the process
of entering into an agreement with various other countries.
As such, the Ministry will endeavor to sign the Visa Waiver Agreement in
the future with countries where many Koreans visit or stay.

###### 2. Creating a Service-Minded Organizational Culture

In order to meet the
expectations and win the
confidence of the general
public, MOFAT has strived to
enhance the quality of the
consular services through
creating a service-minded
organizational culture. To this
end, various training sessions,

Telephone Customer Service Training

including one-day consular

(Reception Hall of MOFAT, March 12, 2007)

training sessions, discussion
forums, service attitude assessments, and Consulate-General meetings were
held to incorporate the idea of ‘kindness’into interactive consular services.
MOFAT will consistently strive to innovate its organizational culture
focusing on outstanding consular services in order to gain the public’s
confidence in the Korean government.


-----

###### 3. Improving Consular Services in Overseas Missions

1) Improvement of Consular Services for Korean Nationals
Abroad


Overseas missions provide consular services for Korean nationals living in
remote regions. The consul visits the region and offers numerous administrative
services such as citizen registration, passport services, and notarial services. In
response to the increase in Koreans’activities overseas, MOFAT plans to
strengthen consular services for its people abroad.


2) Research on the Satisfaction in Diplomatic Missions’
Consular Services

MOFAT declared the year 2005 as the “First Year of Advanced Diplomacy
with the People,”and since then have continued efforts to establish a consular
service system that would satisfy the Korean people. To this end, the Ministry
conducted a pilot research on consumer satisfaction of consular services in
2005 and continued the research once every year until 2007, after designing a
more sophisticated research method based on the results from the pilot
research.
Through these research results, the Ministry is endeavoring to recognize
the needs of the citizens and develop quality assured consular services.


-----

###### 4. Improving the Consular Petition System

1) The e -Consul System

Since December 2004, MOFAT has been operating the e-Consul System,
which integrates the overseas mission network with the central government
network. Such innovation has enabled overseas Koreans to receive one-stop
consular services from overseas missions, more quickly and easily. A major
improvement is the significant reduction in the length of time consumed, which
has decreased from one week to real-time, to deal with numerous
administrative services such as obtaining one’s documents for family register,
resident registration, records for entry into and departure from Korea, personal
identification, and driver’s license. As of February 2008, 95 overseas missions
are connected to this e-Consul System through internal networks, and further
expansion of these services to every Korean mission is underway.

2) Petition Offices

MOFAT has set up petition offices at overseas missions to improve
consular services. In addition, opinion boxes have been placed in each petition
office since March 2005, to collect all complaints, recommendations, and
general opinions on the overall services. In this connection, MOFAT is
exploring a variety of methods to provide services to more people.
Furthermore, MOFAT is attempting to standardize the public/customer service
procedure by reforming consular-related Public Service Protocols and issuing
operation manuals for petition offices at overseas missions.

3) Consular Petition Office at the Incheon International Airport


A consular petition office is in operation at the Incheon International
Airport to issue temporary passports with one year validity or to extend the
validity of a passport by six months for emergency uses in the following cases:
expiration of passport, passport with less than six months of validity remaining,
defect or damage of the passport, or other work-related matters of urgency
except tour-related reasons.

###### 5. Providing Information on Consular Services


1) Website for Information on Travel Safety

The website for Safe Travel Abroad (www.0404.go.kr) was opened in
December 2004 to ensure the safety of Korean nationals, by providing
information on safe traveling and other travel-related issues, including the safety
situation in foreign countries, notices on travel alerts, and information on
passports and consular services. In addition, safety alerts on 78 different regions
have been posted on the website, according to the level of local safety.


2) Media Promotion on Safety Tips for Travelers

With a rapid increase in the number of Korean travelers abroad, securing
travel safety has become crucial. To this end, MOFAT has put in every effort to
provide appropriate information to travelers through timely releases of notices
through the media,[42)] pamphlets, and posters.

###### Chapter 3 Endeavors to Secure Public Support for Foreign Policy

The Ministry has strived to avoid one-way delivery of information, and
instead promote two-way communication with greater openness.
To this end, the Ministry has been actively carrying out a Public Outreach
Program including various direct dialogues with the public and on-line
promotional activities, in a bid to ensure the public’s right to information and to
reflect public opinion in establishing and implementing foreign policies by
providing information regarding major issues on foreign affairs and trade in a
prompt manner.


###### 1. Public Outreach

The Ministry has made
efforts to encourage the
public’s participation in
policies and promote greater
public understanding of
foreign policies by expanding
opportunities for direct
meetings and dialogues with
the public, such as the Visit
MOFAT Program, lectures at
local middle and high

schools, Children’s Day (MOFAT, July 19, 2007)
events, and special lectures
for college students. Participants in these activities are registered as a customer
of the Policy Customer Relationship Management (PCRM), a MOFAT service,
and will have continued access to communications with MOFAT.


-----

###### 2. Indirect Promotional Activities

MOFAT has expanded indirect
promotional activities on-line, which
enables a large number of people to
access information on foreign affairs
and trade in a timely manner. As
major issues on foreign affairs and
trade are posted promptly on the
MOFAT website, users are able to
better understand current events. The
website was restructured to focus on Front page of MOFAT Homepage

(www.mofat.go.kr)

the text, containing less images and a
smaller menu, in a bid to improve the speed of connection on the website. In
addition, the site now has better web accessibility and a strengthened search
function, improving the convenience of users both at home and abroad.


###### 3. Elaborating Measures to Reflect Public Opinion

MOFAT has introduced the PCRM Integrated Management System (PIMS)
as a means of gathering public opinion and strengthening the management of
customer database, newsletter, and policy email services. In particular, the
number of customers and the rate of opened policy emails increased due to
customized services and improved content material.
Moreover, MOFAT has been operating “Cywatch”to monitor major
diplomatic issues posted on various relevant websites and to aggregate
opinions on foreign issues and consular services.

### Advisory Committe for Foreign Policy

The Advisory Committee was established in 1998 in order to acquire advice from experts on
key issues of foreign affairs as well as to help familiarize those experts with MOFAT
activities. For the two-year term from August 1, 2006 to July 31, 2008, 85 people,
representing fields such as academia, press, and civic groups, have acted as members of
the Advisory Committee for foreign policy.

The activities of the Advisory Committee are divided between the plenary session covering
general issues and the specialized session for specifically segmented issues. The plenary
session takes place two or three times annually, whereby committee members and officers
of MOFAT exchange opinions regarding outstanding matters such as the North Korean
nuclear issue and the Korea-U.S. FTA. The specialized session is held at any time upon
request from the related bureau or division that has pre-nominated roughly ten individuals
from the advisory committee, and who are renowned for their specialized fields of interest
such as international law, consular affairs, cultural diplomacy, and regional studies.
Specialized sessions are segmented into 13 areas: diplomatic strategy for the 21[st] Northeast
Asia, Korean Peninsula affairs, Asia-Pacific region, North American region, Latin American
and Caribbean region, European region, Middle East and African region, multilateral issues
and international law, overseas Korean nationals, cultural diplomacy, organization and
personnel affairs, Official Development Assistance, and trade negotiations.

#### Buildup of Diplomatic Capacity

Chapter 1 Overview


Chapter 2 Restructuring

Chapter 3 Human Resource Innovation


-----

###### Chapter 1 Overview

With the rapid rise of Korea’s status in the international community over
the past several years, the nation’s diplomatic area has deepened and
expanded, which in turn has led to a substantial increase in regional and
functional affairs handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade
(MOFAT). Accelerating globalization has called for an increased need to
effectively deal with new global issues such as human rights, terrorism,
environmental protection and development aid.
In order to respond to the changing diplomatic environment and rising
diplomatic demands, MOFAT has made constant efforts to innovate its
personnel structure and organization. At the same time, MOFAT has expanded
foreign diplomatic services to serve the ever-growing national population and
companies seeking expansion abroad.

###### Chapter 2 Restructuring

MOFAT has been seeking a more balanced and diversified diplomacy. To
better respond to changes in Asia’s diplomatic environment, such as the rapid
emergence of China and India, and to strengthen relations with ASEAN and
newly emerging nations, MOFAT separated the Bureau of Asian and Pacific
Affairs into the Northeast Asian Affairs Bureau and the South Asian and Oceania
Affairs Bureau in July 2007.
Also, the Office of Diplomatic Policy was expanded and reformed into the
Office of International Organizations and Global Issues to effectively deal with
global issues including human rights, Official Development Assistance (ODA)
and Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) and play a more active role in the
international community in consideration of the heightened status of Korea.
Within the Office of International Organizations and Global Issues, the Bureau


-----

of Development Cooperation was newly established in order to handle Korea’s
gradually increasing ODA affairs in an effective and strategic way.
As Korea enters an era in which its trade volume has reached $700
billion, MOFAT has opened new embassies in Nicaragua, Belarus, Croatia,
Turkmenistan, Yemen and Angola with a view to stepping up its economic and
trade diplomacy. With the number of Korean nationals traveling and living
abroad reaching 13 million and 7 million respectively, MOFAT set up four new
consulates general in Dubai, Milano, Hamburg and Jeddah to strengthen local
services. In total, the number of Korean foreign missions reached 146,
recovering the level of 1997 when a number of foreign missions were shut
down in the aftermath of the financial crisis.
MOFAT will continue to restructure itself to develop into an advanced
diplomatic organization, securing Korea’s national interests in a world of fierce
competition and implementing foreign policies suitable for Korea’s international
status.

Newly-Established Missions Overseas in 2007

###### Chapter 3 Human Resource Innovation

MOFAT has further opened its doors to civilian experts and professionals
from related ministries in order to strengthen the competitiveness of Foreign
Service officials.
As part of these efforts, with the revised Foreign Service Act coming into
effect in November 2007, MOFAT has participated in the Senior Civil Service
Officer Pool System. As a result, foreign service officials joined the System for
the first time among special service officials. This system provided the basis for
active personnel exchange between related ministries, consequently enhancing
the competitiveness of foreign service officials through the integration of
talented personnel from other ministries. Furthermore, the global competitive
edge of the government as a whole is expected to improve through the sharing
of special experience and knowledge of the Foreign Service with other
ministries.
Since the June 2006 revision to the attache recruitment system, in which'
officials from all ministries and divisions became eligible for recruitment,
MOFAT appointed more than 160 attaches by the first half of 2008. The'
introduction of a new competition system has led to a general improvement in
the expertise and language skills of attaches, as well as to the recruitment of'
attaches from ministries previously unrepresented. MOFAT will continue to'
improve the attache recruitment system so that positions are offered to the most'
competent officials with the greatest expertise and language abilities.
Furthermore, MOFAT has consistently diversified recruitment methods in
order to seek out and foster an excellent workforce from various backgrounds.
In particular, special recruitment for language experts and specialists has
advanced through greater openness and competition in the employment
process.[43)] During the second half of 2007, more than 170 new personnel were
hired through the special recruitment process in various areas including foreign
languages, regional cooperation, multilateral cooperation, education, consular


43) 376 new personnel were hired through special recruitment between January 2004 and February 2008.

services, human resources, public relations, accounting, protocol, economy and
trade, and law. As a result, MOFAT ’s diplomatic capacity has significantly
expanded.
In addition, MOFAT has been constantly improving the recruitment
process for foreign service officials through an assessment of diplomatic ability,
language skills, and specialized knowledge. To facilitate a helpful environment
for new recruits during their adjustment period, the Ministry operates mentoring
programs that encourage closer relations between new recruits and senior
officials.

### Human Resource Recruitment and Competency Assessment

Responding to the growing demand for enhanced professionalism and organizational
competitiveness in the 21[st] century, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade revised the
Foreign Service Act in 2005 and introduced the Diplomatic Competency Assessment
System for counselor and minister-level candidates within the Ministry. Correspondingly, the
Office of Diplomatic Competency Assessment (ODCA, formerly known as the Diplomatic
Competency Assessment Center) was inaugurated and has been in full operation since
then.

The ODCA endeavors to accurately assess three commonly needed and essential
diplomatic competencies (relationship building, diplomatic negotiation, and crisis/situation
management) as well as job-specific competencies required at each level. Unlike other HR
assessments, the ODCA’s competency assessment guarantees reliability and validity by
minimizing the errors of the individualized assessment system. This is done through multiple
assessors using a variety of assessment methods such as in-basket, role-playing and
presentations in simulations.

By January 2008, the ODCA has given competency training to and assessed 58 senior
foreign service officer candidates and 81 counselor candidates. Utilizing the competency
assessment, it has also screened 483 talented aspirants with diverse backgrounds. To
enhance the impartiality and objectiveness of the competency assessment, the ODCA has
frequently held SME (Subject Matter Expert) conferences and worked to advance the system
through exchange with the diplomatic assessment centers of developed countries such as
England, the U.S. and Canada. As a result, the ODCA was able to establish an international
standard for the diplomatic competency assessment system in a relatively short period of
time. Moreover, the ODCA is being recognized for its unprecedented excellence in
assessment and has become a role model for various government agencies (the Seoul
Metropolitan Government, KORAIL, etc) and other private companies.

The ODCA will continue to improve the current assessment and development system for the
purpose of strengthening the aforementioned competencies of foreign service officers, which
will enable them and the Ministry to efficiently cope with the rapidly changing international
environment.
