### FOREWORD

The Government Security and Defence Policy Report, built on the comprehensive
concept of security, is presented to Parliament in accordance with the
Government Programme. The Report lays the foundation for guiding Finland’s
policy and strengthening its action in promoting Finland’s interests and goals
in the changing international situation.

The Report analyses the changes, trends and the global security environment,
as well as the conclusions based on these, Finland’s security policy, the
development of defence and actions to secure the vital functions of society.
Accordingly, the Report reviews a wide range of instruments.

The Government Security and Defence Policy Report is the latest in a series of
Government Reports issued on the subject. Special attention is given to topics
in which signi�cant changes have either occurred since the ���� Report, or
are foreseen.

The Report does not repeat the content or topics of speci�c policy documents
that supplement the Security and Defence Policy Report.

The focus of the Report e�tends into the ����s. Due to the long�term nature
of defence procurement, planning cycles and mid�life updates, defence
development in particular requires analysis and guidelines that extend into the
next decade.

The practice of issuing Reports aims to gain broad political consensus and the
support of the citizens on Finland’s security and defence policy.

### SUMMARY

The summary describes the fundamental aspects of Finnish security and
defence policy and focuses on the factors which are particularly important in
Finland’s security environment, and which impact Finland’s key policy choices.
The most important goals of Finland’s foreign, security and defence policy
are safeguarding the country’s independence and territorial sovereignty,
guaranteeing the basic values, security and well�being of the population and
maintaining a functioning society.

Finland’s security policy encompasses both actively creating security and
anticipating and responding to security threats. Defence policy supports the
goals of the security policy. Ensuring Finland’s security calls for the use of a
wide range of foreign, security and defence policy instruments.

Finland’s security is built on good bilateral relations, exerting maximum
in�uence in the European �nion �E�� and broad�based cooperation with other
states and international actors. Finland participates in international burden�
sharing, the creation of viable global governance and solving international
problems.

Finland’s security and defence policy guidelines are characterised by continuity,
transparency and a strong commitment to European and international
cooperation. These are epitomised by active participation in the development
of the E�’s common security and defence policy, �AT� partnership, �ordic
cooperation and international crisis management.

###### The security environment and the impact of the changes in it

Globalisation has intensi�ed the interdependence between states which is
a fundamentally positive factor. The states that have experienced economic
success have increased their international in�uence. Technological development
has revolutionised the possibilities for global communications and dialogue. The
increasing signi�cance of non�state actors in shaping the security environment
has been a central phenomenon. �owever, non�state actors can also create
instability. Population growth and climate change, the principal trends at the
global level, are continuing and increasingly impact the security of states and
citizens in many ways.

Changes in the security environment also impact global governance and the
efforts to change the structures of the international system. The signi�cance

10


-----

of commonly accepted rules and procedures is growing, and the importance
of the �nited �ations ���� as the sole world organisation is accentuated.
The �� Security Council has a central role in legitimising universally binding
international decisions.

Finland can best guarantee its security and well�being by actively participating
in strengthening both global and European security structures as well as the
security structures in the neighbourhood and by participating in international
cooperation. Finland needs to ensure preparedness for external security
challenges which are dif�cult to foresee. Finland’s objective is that international
cooperation be built on transparency and the promotion of human rights,
democracy and the rule of law as well as compliance with international law.

The changes in global power structures that have taken place in recent
years have primarily been the result of differences in countries’ economic
development. While the western economies have suffered from anaemic
growth, China, especially, has been overwhelmingly successful. This has not,
however, altered the status of the �nited States as the most in�uential country
in the world.

Finland highlights the importance of the cohesion of the European �nion
and comprehensive E� policies vis���vis its strategic partners, such as China,
the �nited States and Russia. Simultaneously, Finland continues to foster its
bilateral relations with countries central to global policy and the world economy.

The �nited States is shifting the focus of its international politics to Asia, but it
will remain a strong actor in Europe. Finland strives for broad�based bilateral
cooperation with the �nited States.

Russia is Finland’s biggest trading partner, but the signi�cance of the two being
neighbouring countries greatly transcends that of their economic relations.
The wide�ranging relations encompass active political dialogue, cooperation
between the authorities and increasing interaction at the level of the citizen.
Russia’s foreign and security policy guidelines, its societal development and the
state and development prospects of the major military power are, naturally,
issues that interest Finland. It is in Finland’s interest that Russia increasingly
commits to European development, international collaboration and integrates
into the structures of the global economy. The development of E��Russian
cooperation in the �eld of foreign and security policy is also an important goal
which Finland supports.

11

�embership of the European �nion is a fundamental value�based choice for
Finland. It also includes a strong security policy dimension. It is important
for Finland that the �nion retain its role in preserving stability in Europe and
its signi�cance as a security community. The development of the Common
Foreign and Security Policy �CFSP� and the Common Security and Defence
Policy �CSDP�, to which Finland is committed, supports the aforementioned
goal. Furthermore, the solidarity clause and the mutual assistance clause
included in the Treaty of �isbon bolster the character of the �nion as a security
community. E� enlargement, an effective and comprehensive European
�eighbourhood Policy and the efforts to strengthen common values through
the �rganization for Security and Co�operation in Europe ��SCE� promote the
development of a value�based community in Europe. The development of E�
crisis management capabilities strengthens the �nion’s credibility as a global
actor. Simultaneously, membership of the �nion provides a central channel for
advancing international and global goals that are nationally important.

The �nion is a major actor in many key areas related to societal development
and comprehensive security. The common foreign and security policy, climate
and energy policy, action combating terrorism and organised crime, border
management, immigration policy, promotion of rules�based free trade and
sustainable development are but examples of the E�’s efforts intended
to impact global development and threat scenarios, and to strengthen the
international leverage of the �nion. Exerting in�uence actively and coherently
in the E� serves Finland’s interests.

As a result of the Eurozone crisis the European �nion is in a dif�cult situation.
The weakening of the �nion’s internal unity, it experiencing more discord
or losing its capacity would impact the E�’s global role and also Finland’s
international standing. Finland aims to strengthen the E�’s cohesion and its
capacity to act internationally in all relevant areas.

The �ordic countries are an important and natural reference group for Finland.
Within the �ordic community there is broad consensus on societal goals and
the countries are committed to the promotion of the �ordic model. The �ordic
countries have similar views regarding the advancement of the rule of law,
human rights, gender equality and sustainable development. A tradition of
active and practical cooperation exists between the civilian authorities.

Finland promotes the development of �ordic cooperation in foreign, security
and defence policy as well. This bolsters the role of the �ordic countries as
an international actor, and promotes stability in �orthern Europe and the
northern regions. �ordic Defence Cooperation ���RDEFC�� is a �exible way

12


-----

to improve interoperability, compatibility and cost�effectiveness. The idea of
�ordic cooperation in the air surveillance of Iceland is seen as a concrete
opportunity for closer cooperation in the near future.

The transatlantic connection between �orth America and Europe materialises,
�rst and foremost, in their interlinked economies. The cornerstone of
transatlantic security policy is �AT�, which advances security and stability
in Europe. For Finland, partnership cooperation with �AT� is important and
Finland actively participates in the wide�ranging development of �AT�’s
partnership policy.

Comprehensive participation in international crisis management ���, E�,
�AT� and �SCE� is an integral element of Finland’s foreign, security and
defence policy. Decisions taken on crisis management participation will be
made from the foreign and security policy perspective, taking into account the
needs of the con�ict area and the operation in question, available capabilities
and �nancial resources. Finnish participation in military crisis management
corresponds to the level of Finland’s long�term commitment to the preservation
and development of international peace and stability. This bolsters Finland’s
standing and demonstrates a clear willingness to participate in international
burden�sharing.

Finland’s civilian crisis management participation continues to emphasise
expertise of a high standard in police, rule of law, border management, human
rights and gender equality issues. Finland is also striving to improve its impact
in civilian crisis management. The goal is to second approximately ��� Finnish
experts to civilian crisis management missions.

Finland develops its crisis management capabilities by participating in
multinational training and exercises organised by the European �nion, �nited
�ations and �AT� as well as its �ember States and partner countries. �et
another goal is to continue and improve �ordic cooperation in international
crisis management operations.

Advancing all sectors of the Treaty on the �on�Proliferation of �uclear Weapons,
including the non�proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, requires a
strong commitment from the international community and robust collaborative
regimes. Finland is committed to the strengthening and intensi�cation of these
regimes.

Growing interdependence and the increasingly technological operating
environment also bring a new kind of vulnerability of society to the forefront.

13


-----

�odern, network�based societal structures are increasingly dependent on critical
infrastructure, which includes, among other things, transport, communications
and energy supply. Since nearly all critical functions and services of society
depend on technical systems that use electricity and telecommunications, the
risk of serious disruptions in society becomes all the more serious. This kind of
challenge to the comprehensive security of society can be met by developing
comprehensive security thinking and cooperation. It is a necessary requirement
in securing the vital functions of society in all conditions. The near�term focus
will be on securing the cyber domain, critical to the information society.

In addition to the traditional military threat scenario the comprehensive
concept of security covers a number of different topics, phenomena and
challenges such as climate change, scarcity of energy and water resources,
population growth and migrations, terrorism, infectious diseases, organised
crime in its different forms, such as drug and human traf�cking, cyber attacks
and the increasing vulnerability of society. These issues progressively impact
international cooperation and also Finland’s security environment.

Economically, socially and ecologically sound development is the precondition
of comprehensive global security. �perating under the pressure of changes
Finland must foster international cooperation, participate in strengthening
security in its neighbourhood and elsewhere in Europe, and prepare to respond
to various security challenges at many levels.

When it comes to Finland’s neighbouring areas, on the one hand the changes
visible in the Arctic neighbourhood add to the economic appeal of the region
and, on the other hand, highlight the need for sustainable action. Changes in
the appeal of the region also translate into a rise of security policy interest in
the area.

###### Defence development

Finland’s present security environment is stable. Factors affecting security such
as the unpredictability of the operating environment and uncertainty may also
cause negative security impacts on Finland. A wider European con�ict or a
regional crisis may result in using political pressure or military force against
Finland. While the threat of large�scale armed aggression is low, it cannot
categorically be ruled out. Military force can also be used in a limited fashion as
part of political or economic pressure. Finland must continue to ensure its own
defence capability. Developments in the operating environment require that
the defence doctrine and the operating principles of the forces be continually
improved.

14


-----

The primary purpose of the defence capability is to establish deterrence against
the use of military force and the threat thereof. As a militarily non�aligned
country Finland prepares to repel military threats without outside assistance.
Consequently, it maintains all of the capability areas in the defence system.
�evertheless, the defence capability and its development increasingly depend
on national and international cooperation.

Military defence is an integral part of society’s comprehensive security.
Preparedness for wide�ranging security threats demands networking between
the defence establishment, society and the business community as well as
close international cooperation. The Defence Forces’ resources will also be
used in support of the other authorities.

Multinational defence cooperation and participation in military crisis
management strengthen Finland’s defence capability. Cooperation can be
carried out between several entities while avoiding duplication. Active defence
cooperation bolsters deterrence and defence, and ensures the development of
military capabilities. Cooperation facilitates the reception of political support and
host nation support, should Finland’s resources prove insuf�cient. Reciprocally,
Finland must be prepared and able to provide military and other assistance
to others when required. Cooperation is carried out under the auspices of
the E� and �AT� partnership, in regional groups and bilaterally. The E� and
�AT� play supportive roles in multinational projects. Concrete cooperation
between willing countries occurs in groupings, of which the most important
from Finland’s perspective is the �ordic defence cooperation arrangement
��RDEFC�. �ther collaborative countries important to Finland include the
countries in �orthern Europe and the �nited States. Finland cooperates with
the �nited States especially in the �eld of defence materiel.

In ���� the wartime strength of the Defence Forces will be approximately
��� ��� troops. The aim is to have more capable units and weapon systems
in order to compensate for the reduction in troop strengths. The formation of
the new regional units alongside operational and territorial units will bolster
the local defence capability.

Military defence is built on long�term and consistent planning, extending beyond
several Government terms. The Defence Forces Reform will be implemented
by ����. The reform is a necessary precondition for the capacity and further
development of the Defence Forces while the defence for the ����s is being
built. The political guidelines related to maintenance and development of the
defence capability must take into account the capabilities’ entire life cycle. It is
important to prepare for the key challenges to the defence capability already

15


-----

during the ongoing decade, and capability planning must extend all the way
to the ����s.

Finland will continue to see to its own defence. The defence solution is built
on a territorial defence system covering the entire area of the country and
general conscription will remain one of its cornerstones. The key objectives of
Finland’s defence policy are the maintenance of a defence capability tailored to
the security environment and resources, and the development of the defence
as part of comprehensive security, and intensifying multinational defence
cooperation.

### THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT

#### 1 Security in the global transition

###### 1.1 Interdependence and indivisible security

 Global trends

The development of Finland, like that of other countries, is increasingly
connected to globalisation and changes in the international environment.
Simultaneously, security�related challenges and cross�border threats are more
frequently multidimensional and interconnected, and require the utilisation of
a wide range of instruments. It is justi�ed to analyse the security environment
and make policy decisions on the basis of a comprehensive concept of security.

Greater interdependence affects the everyday life of people and societies in
countless ways. Each state is dependent upon others as it takes decisions
regarding its economy, societal development and security. Therefore, it
is necessary to �nd common solutions to bring the challenges related to
sustainable development and security under shared governance.

Population growth and climate change are the most important factors affecting
long�term global security. Since the end of the Second World War the world’s
population has tripled. Population growth heavily stresses the environment
and natural resources as well as economic and societal structures. At the same
time the world is rapidly urbanising.

The advancing climate change impacts security both locally and globally. �atural
disasters and widespread damage to the environment weaken human security
and cause con�icts. The effects of climate change are felt more and more
widely geographically. The melting Arctic ice cap is a striking phenomenon in
Finland’s neighbouring areas, which also has global consequences.

Demand for raw materials and energy does not only continue to grow in step
with the population growth and, especially, the economic growth of developing
countries, but also with the increasing consumption in industrialised countries.
There is growing concern over energy security. There will be progressively
more competition, locally and globally, over vital commodities such as water
and food. Guaranteeing the availability of natural resources requires the
strengthening of rules�based cooperation based on openness.

17


-----

Increasing inequalities within and between states and regions as well as
continuing widespread poverty reduce security in many ways.The potential for
con�ict also arises from the state of affairs within societies. When intertwined,
imbalanced economic and social development, internal con�icts, violations of
democracy and human rights as well as a non�existent rule of law can diminish
the viability and legitimacy of states.

The correlation between sustainable development and security is becoming
increasingly apparent. More effective climate change mitigation and adaptation
as well as the integration of ecological, social and economic development in a
sustainable way are all critical to the future of humankind.

Regional and local con�icts continue to challenge global security. The
consequences of con�ict, such as refugee �ows, have ever more often spillover
effects beyond their immediate surroundings. Particularly the condition of fragile
states may turn into wider con�icts, resulting in humanitarian crises. Con�ict�
prone and fragile states may provide a fertile environment for extremism and
terrorism as well as organised crime.

Sudden negative shifts in the economy add to societal uncertainty and, when
exacerbated, can cause unrest even in established democracies.

In an interdependent world it is more and more dif�cult to advance national
interests by means of military power politics, nor would they achieve lasting
results the way they did in the past. However, even though the viability of force
as an instrument of policy has diminished, military capabilities still matter,
especially as the dimension of regional in�uence.

###### Need for global governance

Growing interdependence and globalisation – though extremely positive
phenomena as such – pose entirely new challenges to the way communities,
states and nations organise their mutual relationships and adapt to the
requirements posed by sustainable development. The maintenance and
development of security in a globalised, interdependent operating environment
demands progressively more international cooperation, credible international
institutions as well as an active foreign, security and defence policy.

The structures created in the aftermath of World War II, including the shared
norms and institutions, will continue to serve as the base for international
order. However, non�state actors such as non�governmental organisations
��G��, different networks, businesses and the social media are ever more
important as agents of change and reformers of global cooperation. They can

19


-----

increasingly challenge and supplement the operating modes of states and
international organisations in con�icts and con�ict resolution.

In a globalised world a properly functioning international system is in the
shared interest of states. This improves the conditions for cooperation. The
need to develop the structures and instruments of global governance is
highlighted, because the existing institutions and their operating principles
no longer fully correspond to the changes in the operating environment and
power relations. This has been seen, for example, in multilateral climate change
talks. Globalisation and interdependence also increase vulnerability when the
consequences of problems rapidly spread far and wide.

###### International power relations

Changes in the economic power relations are re�ected in international power
relations. The emerging economies, particularly China, are increasing their
political clout by means of their strong economic growth. While the �nited
States will continue to be the most in�uential country in global politics, it has
lost some of its stature. Also the in�uence of the other established western
powers, especially the E�, which is in the throes of an economic and debt
crisis, has weakened in relation to the countries experiencing rapid economic
growth. The western countries are in debt and facing a period of meagre
growth. Despite the fact that the growth rates of the emerging economies will
slow down in the coming years and that they need to institute social reforms,
the transformation in the balance of power will continue.

In addition to the increasing in�uence of the large emerging economies many
other states such as Indonesia and Turkey have raised their political and
economic clout, both regionally and globally. Furthermore, several regional
groupings and organisations such as the African �nion �A�� and the Economic
Community of West African States �EC�WAS� have strengthened their role.

Globalisation has brought nearly every country into the sphere of the global
marketplace. The integration of large developing countries like China, India
and Brazil into the global economy has entailed a major upheaval. Globalisation
has facilitated sustained and rapid economic growth, which is gradually moving
the hub of production away from Europe and the �nited States. In recent years
the emerging economies in Asia have borne the brunt of the global economic
growth. In addition, the economic relations between the southern hemisphere
economies have become more intense, and global economic interaction and
the total volume of investments have signi�cantly grown.

20


-----

The role of the economy in power relations has grown along with interdependence
and prolonged economic imbalances. The underlying causes of the weakening
growth potential include internal factors such as slowing population growth
rates and ageing. Painful decisions in society have to be taken to stop the
growing indebtedness of states. At the same time, ensuring the recovery
capability of the economy and society and preserving equality between the
generations are key challenges. It is important to develop versatile indicators
alongside the Gross �ational Product �G�P� which also measure well�being.
Chronic �nancing shortages and indebtedness have increased the vulnerability
of countries. A constant �ow of new technological breakthroughs is required to
sustain economic growth.

Economic and monetary policy plays an important role in power relations,
such as in the Sino��S relationship. China is one of the major creditors of
the �SA and China’s dollar�based assets are primarily invested in �S treasury
bonds. Whereas the �nited States demands that China revalue its currency
and correct its trade imbalance with the �SA, China, for its part, criticises the
�nited States over its monetary and �nancial policy, hoping to see stability�
building solutions.

###### Burden-sharing in global questions

Irrespective of the changes in the balance of power the West still projects the
most power, and bears the brunt of the international response to global and
cross�border problems, security challenges and hurdles to progress. �ver the
long term, the key questions are whether the emerging countries will assume
more responsibility for solving global problems and how their respective
interrelationships and their relations with established democracies will develop
in the conditions of international structural transformation.

The shift in the balance of power has also become evident in international
organisations such as the ��, the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund �IMF�� it has also impacted their role in global governance. Be that as it
may, the post�WWII structures, including their standards and institutions, will
continue to serve as the basis of the international order. Due to the changing
power relations, decision�making systems are facing increasing pressures to
change. However, in the ��, for example, progress has not been suf�cient.

The gloomy outlook for the global economy causes distrust on several levels,
which can also emerge in increasing protectionism and nationalism. This
simultaneously challenges the maintenance and development of a transparent
and rules�based collaborative international order. The emerging countries, as
well, have relied on the present, rules�based international system, which has
facilitated their economic growth, nor are they offering any alternatives to this
structure.

The rules�based and collaborative international order relies on the respect of
international law, the consolidation of democracy and the safeguarding of the
rule of law and human rights, which are the key values of the E� and states
committed to democracy. As the so�called Arab Spring recently demonstrated,
they epitomise the overall appeal of western democracies. These values,
sometimes referred to as western values, are universal values adopted by the
�� and legal standards based on international agreements.

It is apparent that the emerging countries also diverge regarding their views
on the values and principles on which international cooperation should be
built. �uestions related to self�determination as well as views on international
interventions and the use of sanctions have taken centre stage. The basic
premises of Brazil, India, South Africa and other democratic states may be
different than those of many other emerging powers. Differing values may
result in pressure to change the international system as well as in paralysis
during con�icts.

###### Significance of comprehensive security questions

Due to growing global interdependence the external and internal security of
states are more closely intertwined than before. The prevention of threats
as well as preparedness requires civilian and military resources from society.
Cross�border threats such as organised crime, terrorism, traf�cking in narcotics
and humans, infectious diseases, environmental threats, disruptions in energy
supply and cyber attacks continue to grow in importance. International
contingency planning cooperation between states is increasing.

�ncertainty in economic growth continues. At the same time the business
sector and the civil society are assuming more important roles as regards
securing the vital functions of society. This transformation accelerates as the
public sector is being adapted to balancing the economy. Long, even global,
value chains along with the globalisation of businesses reduce the options of the
national authorities in regulating, steering or monitoring business operations.

Modern, network�based societal structures are increasingly dependent on critical
infrastructure, which includes, among other things, transport, communications
and energy supply. Simultaneously, the vulnerability of this infrastructure only
increases. Practically all critical functions and services of society depend on
technical systems that use electricity and telecommunications. As wireless
communications and system networking become ubiquitous the risk of serious
disruptions in society becomes all the more serious.

Along with technological advances it becomes increasingly easier for non�state
actors to cause harm. Asymmetric and highly destructive means are developed
to counter an adversary’s technological and material supremacy. Asymmetric
means can also be used against society in general, rather than the armed forces
alone. Chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear �CBR�� threats, terrorism
and cyber attacks can cause severe, rapidly escalating crises. Preventing and
repelling them requires comprehensive preparedness.

Securing the global commons �freedom of the seas, the atmosphere and man�
made cyberspace� and protecting the free and reliable use of cyberspace are
questions of growing importance. The phenomenon highlights the importance
of international regulations. The �nited �ations Convention on the Law of the
Sea ���CL�S� lays a comprehensive foundation for all use of the world’s seas
and all conservation measures relating to them. For example, its central role
has been brought to the forefront in the Arctic region.

Disruptions in the cyber domain, especially, present a critical threat. The causes
of cyber threats include vulnerabilities within networks as well as hackers

23


-----

that deliberately cause damage or illegally search for information. Extensive
networks are exposed to accidental disruptions as well. It will become more
dif�cult to distinguish between state�sponsored and non�state sponsored cyber
attacks or to determine the source of the threats.

Cyber security issues cause con�ict and division within the international
community. Their underlying causes include economic and security interests
as well as diverging views on human rights and the role of the state vis���
vis individual freedom. Cooperation is presently being developed in the E�,
�AT�, the �SCE and the �� as well as among different country groupings.
Many states are developing their capability to defend themselves against cyber
attacks and to project different forms of countermeasures on the adversary.
Cyber questions are vital topics as regards military security and securing the
vital functions of society.

A new era has dawned in the cyber domain: malware can now impact all vital
functions of society through industrial automation and programmable logic
controllers. Technological progress in cyberspace increases the risk of new
threats. Finland, too, has already been the target of internal and external cyber
operations.

Energy security is a growing challenge in many areas of the world, Europe
included. The E� imports more than half of the energy it consumes and the
relative share of imported energy keeps on growing. Energy imports are
increasingly concentrated, since Russia has become the leading exporter of
crude oil, coal and natural gas. At the same time the E� area has incorporated
important policies on the increased use of renewables and energy saving
measures. The intention is to respond to the energy security challenge by
expanding the energy base, its suppliers and transit routes, and by promoting
good governance and respect for the rule of law as well as through investments
in the countries of origin. The E� actively pursues these goals.

The E� aims to strengthen the European Energy Policy. The policy takes into
account the internal market as well as environmental questions. Within certain
constraints, it is up to the Member States to choose their energy sources.
The E� should further develop an energy policy that considers both internal
and external dimensions, a more harmonised energy market as well as crisis
mechanisms capable of handling temporary disruptions in energy supplies.

The safety of nuclear power plants is a key question both internationally
and regionally. Whereas each country is responsible for its nuclear safety,
international conventions, norms and standards are actively being developed,

24


-----

especially within the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency
�IAEA�. The E� is the �rst major regional actor in the �eld of nuclear energy
that legislates nuclear safety.

Equal access to clean water is a growing ecological and political challenge.
Water resources and their poor state cause tension between different forms
of use and users both within and between countries and can even result in
instability or con�ict. �n the other hand, joint management of shared water
resources achieved by strengthening international agreements can help
alleviate tensions. This applies to other key commodities and strategic raw
materials as well. �n these topics as well the E� will develop international
cooperation and its in�uence as part of its external action.

While the threat of terrorism has already been commonplace for decades,
during the past �� years it has been in a state of continual transformation.
International terrorism is organised and intricate. The problem is exacerbated,
among other things, by the association of terrorism with religious and other
extremist movements as well as by technological advances that provide
increasingly effective tools for the purpose of causing harm. The in�uence of
extremism is projected to be on the rise. As demonstrated by the tragic events
in �orway in ����, terrorism or violent extremism are not always associated
with external networks or foreign actors.

Global counter�terrorist cooperation and, especially, the E�’s counter�terrorist
action is being further intensi�ed. This comprehensively encompasses
cooperation in judicial and internal affairs, combating radicalisation and
terrorist recruitment, and preventing the underlying causes of terrorism such
as social exclusion and inequality. Target protection, tracking down terrorists
and dealing with the aftereffects of terrorist strikes are also important topics.

International organised crime such as the traf�cking in narcotics and humans
as well as the illicit arms trade and money laundering are growing international
problems. Simultaneously, as the free movement of people increases more
police and judicial cooperation are required.

Dangerous infectious diseases pose a serious international security threat.
Combating natural or intentionally spread contagious diseases requires closer
cooperation and preparedness among civilian and military authorities.

Signi�cant questions are also associated with border management, immigration
control and the functioning of international civil defence cooperation.

Conclusions

Finland is increasingly dependent on international well�being, stability
and security and Finland’s security challenges arise from a wider
international setting. In this respect Finland faces no speci�c or
immediate security threats. However, unforeseeable developments in
the operating environment and uncertainty may also cause negative
security impacts on Finland.

The changes in the global security environment offer, �rst and foremost,
economic and political prospects for Finland. However, they also
pose challenges such as cross�border security challenges. A strong
commitment to wide�ranging international cooperation serves Finland’s
interests. Global interdependence also highlights the signi�cance of
multilateral cooperation.

The increase of the E�’s in�uence serves Finland’s interests. Finland
has an established status as an active Member of the E� and as an
international actor. Changes in the international power balance affect
the relative position of the E� and, hence, that of Finland.

It is important for Finland that international cooperation continue
to build on transparency and universal values and international law.
Finland will endeavour to strengthen them as a Member State of the
E� and in cooperation with other democracies. It would be of great
importance that the emerging powers increase their participation in
solving international questions, including burden�sharing.

When it comes to global public goods Finland has actively advanced the
strengthening of cooperation and international arrangements related to
transboundary water resource management. In Rio���, �� conference
on Sustainable Development Finland promoted adoption of a global
goal on water, which would consist of universal access to water and
sanitation, improved water ef�ciency and water quality.

The development of international cooperation is essential with regard to
all cross�border threats. Above all, through the E� and bilaterally Finland
responds to challenges to comprehensive security and by taking action
on topics such as climate and energy policy, terrorism and organised
crime, border management and immigration control.

As an economy reliant on exports, Finland depends on, among other
things, the international media networks and trade and transport
networks. This is becoming increasingly important owing to technological
advances and other economic and societal development. Finland is one
of the most developed information societies and its functions depend on
various electronic networks and services therein.

The threat of international terrorism in Finland remains low. Because
of the rising number of persons that may have terrorism�related

26


-----

connections and the increasing threat of terrorism in its neighbouring
areas, Finland, too, must actively monitor the threat of terrorism and
institute preventive measures.

###### 1.2 Role of the key actors in the global transition

 Role of the European Union as a global actor

The idea of strengthening and utilising interdependence, including the need
for common rules, is an important principle of the European �nion. Hence, it
is only natural that the E� is one of the leading actors in many international
cooperative structures.

The E� plays an invaluable role in strengthening the international judicial
system, promoting the freedom and transparency of the international economy,
and setting up and defending its rules.

The E� has assumed, and is expected to assume, the role of responsible
initiator in resolving global issues such as controlling climate change,
guaranteeing sustainable development, eradicating poverty and developing
global governance. The E�’s clout as a global actor hinges on its ability to
ef�ciently operate within international organisations. For this reason, the E�’s
coherence in international organisations should be strengthened.

The E� has fallen into a severe economic crisis from which there is no fast
way out. It is imperative to solve the crisis, revive economic growth and
competitiveness as well as strengthen the E�’s internal cohesion and preserve
its character as a value community. These are necessary for the �nion to
maintain its credibility and secure its role as a global actor and a strategic
partner for other major actors. The �nion’s valuable input is not limited to
the economy, and so a decline of the �nion would more extensively erode the
multinational system and international cooperation.

�ther factors of uncertainty are also related to the �nion’s future development
and they re�ect on its global capacity. These include issues such as the growing
pressure for differentiated integration, recent internal developments in certain
Member States, challenges related to stabilising the European neighbourhood
and the dif�culties the E�’s enlargement policy faces.

�otwithstanding its own crisis, the E�’s international standing faces pressures
caused by economic, political and value�related changes in the world. The E�’s
strong position as the world’s largest economic area has been the crux of its

27


-----

in�uence. In the conditions of global transition the E� will continue to be a
leading trade policy actor and an important trading partner for the other major
actors.

A functioning transatlantic partnership between the European �nion and the
�nited States is crucial to the E�’s international in�uence. Economic cooperation
between the E� and the �nited States lays the foundation for an open and
collaborative international economy, which must be further strengthened.

The E� continues to cooperate multilaterally, among other things, in supporting
democracy, human rights, basic rights and liberties and gender equality, and
in promoting the rule of law and in crisis management. At the same time the
E� establishes collaborative networks and partnerships, especially with the
emerging powers and regional organisations.

The strengthening of the E� as a global actor demands a more ef�cient use
of its wide range of policy instruments in its external relations. The external
action policy includes the common commercial policy and development policy,
the common foreign and security policy �CFSP� and its subset, the common
security and defence policy �CSDP�. In addition, the E�’s internal policies
and their external dimension are valuable instruments in the �nion’s global
action, which includes environmental and climate issues and the prevention of
international crime.

The structures created by the Lisbon Treaty increase the chances of
strengthening the E�’s role� they also improve the consistency, coherence and
effectiveness of its external action. �onetheless, the goal of the external action,
i.e. coherence between the different policies of the �nion’s external action
and between these and its other policies, has not materialised as planned.
The phase of setting up the European External Action Service, including the
evolution of its institutional culture, is still in progress. It is a challenge for the
High Representative to combine the plethora of roles of the of�ce.

E� Member States have lacked the political will to act more coherently and
support the activities of the High Representative and the External Action
Service. Predominantly the large Member States do not always act within the
framework of the �nion, which weakens the E�’s capacity. The Member States’
foreign and security policy priorities often result in E� foreign policy which is
built on compromises based on the lowest common denominator. This weakens
the �nion’s capacity and decreases its clout. �either has the CFSP been at the
core of political decision�making in recent years.

28


-----

In order to improve the effectiveness of the CFSP the Member States should
be able to establish a common strategic vision which de�nes the key foreign
policy questions, common objectives and the order of importance of these. In
the long run, provided that the E� wants to retain its capacity to respond to
global security challenges, there is no alternative for a robust common foreign
and security policy.

###### The United States shifts focus to Asia

Despite the global change the �nited States will retain its world leadership
and it plays a key role in solving many global problems and in responding to
challenges. From the standpoint of a well�functioning rules�based international
system, it is important that the �nited States commit to the multilateral system
as well as to international law and cooperation.

Taking into account the geopolitical shifts, the present state of the economy,
the lessons learned from the protracted operations in Iraq and Afghanistan
and counter�terrorist action, the �nited States has undertaken a review of its
security strategy. Apart from the energy sector the �nited States, generally
speaking, is becoming increasingly dependent on the international system. By
the end of this decade �orth America will be nearly self�suf�cient as regards
fossil fuels. This may affect the manner in which the �nited States chooses to
emphasise its strategic interests.

Different views exist in the �nited States concerning the future orientation
of its foreign policy. The present administration believes in the promotion of
partnerships and cooperation. There are also those who think the �nited States
should attempt to preserve its primacy in different situations by resorting to
power politics, if necessary. Then there are those who believe that the �nited
States should discerningly curtail its international role, focusing resources on
domestic issues instead.

In recent years the �nited States has exercised its international leadership in
a �exible manner by creating partnerships, calling for dialogue and committing
to multilateral cooperation. Meanwhile, the �nited States has retained its
military supremacy, and continues to act unilaterally when it sees �t to do so.

The overall strategic interest of the �nites States as well as its economic and
military focus is shifting towards the Asia�Paci�c region. The �SA prepares to
maintain its geopolitical presence and security commitments with its allies in
the region. The countries in the area hope that the �nited States will act as a

29


-----

counterbalance to China’s rising military power. In addition, the Greater Middle
East has a prominent role in �S defence planning.

The strategic shift does not imply that the �nited States is about to abandon
its commitments to Europe or its role as the ultimate guarantor of European
security. The close ties between the �nited States and Europe mean that
the �nited States will also continue to participate in wider European security
cooperation. From the �S standpoint �AT� is the key forum for security policy
cooperation and dialogue. The commitment and capabilities of the �nited States
associated with �AT�’s collective defence arrangements remain unchanged.

In the era of global challenges the E� and the �nited States, being close
strategic partners, are expected to cooperate to achieve lasting solutions. The
�nited States believes that a cohesive E�, capable of robust global action,
serves its interests. From the standpoint of �S interests it is also imperative
that the European economic crisis be resolved. To intensify the transatlantic
partnership the �nited States aims to persuade the European countries to
assume a greater role in maintaining international security and in con�ict�
solution. The E� hopes that the �nited States would increasingly commit
to comprehensive security measures such as climate change prevention.
The economy is at the core of the transatlantic link. This is so because the
economies of Europe and the �nited States are closely intertwined and the
regions are each other’s largest trading partners, representing up to one third
of the volume of world trade.

The global military presence of the �nited States is built on rapidly deployable
troops and units positioned abroad. Most western democracies �including the
overwhelming majority of the E� Member States� are bilateral or multilateral
politico�military allies of the �nited States. �ther democracies, too, have signed
various partnership arrangements with it. The �nited States considers that
democratic countries, owing to the shared value base, establish the nucleus of
an open and collaborative international order.

###### China’s global authority is on the rise

Because of its opening economy and signi�cant economic growth China has
become the world’s second largest economy. In a relatively short period of
time it managed to lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. During
this time China also became a major importer of raw materials and energy.
Safeguarding the access to natural resources is a key goal of China’s foreign
policy.

30


-----

Economic growth can be considered to be the central factor that maintains
China’s internal stability. The differences in standards of living in China are
great and there are a considerable number of poor people. �ne of China’s key
goals relates to extending the higher standards of living beyond its wealthier
coastal areas. �ther signi�cant challenges include the ageing population, social
problems, issues related to human rights and freedom of speech, the progress
of democracy as well as unsolved environmental problems.

The mere size of China and its dynamic economy have turned it into an
important economic actor on the global scale. China bene�ts from the western�
created, transparent and rules�based world economy.

China continues to focus on its internal problems and on raising its standard
of living. This re�ects on its foreign policy as well. However, other countries
want China to play a constructive international role when it comes to burden�
sharing in solving global economic and environmental problems, including
climate change and regional crises. While it has continued to emphasise its
development challenges, warily eyeing any new commitments, it has also
undertaken noteworthy action in curbing its growing environmental problems.

China stresses state sovereignty as well as non�interference in states’ internal
affairs. China has preparedness to retaliate should foreign powers criticise its
policies on human rights or Tibet. For China, its �ne�China Policy is integral
part of its foreign policy, and it concerns especially Taiwan. �ne�China Policy
is widely recognised within the international community, including the E�.

China, like the other countries in the area, shows growing interest in maritime
regions and groups of islands off the Paci�c coastline. Regarding security in
Eastern Asia as well as global security it is important that regional and local
disputes such as those in the South China Sea be solved through consultations.
This should be done under international law, including the principles of
international maritime law. The South China Sea possesses global strategic
importance because approximately one half of the world trade passes through
its maritime routes.

While China has no treaty�based network of allies, economic interaction
increases its in�uence in its neighbourhood as well as in Africa and Latin
America. The economic integration of the large economies in Eastern Asia
increases their shared interests which, in time, may bring them closer together.
The European �nion is an important trading partner for China. Conversely,
China is the biggest supplier of industrial products for the �nion. Both parties
are increasingly interested in mutual cooperation. This being the case, both

31


-----

sides are committed to launching negotiations of an E��China investment
agreement as soon as possible.

###### Russia’s wide-ranging interests

Russia aims to preserve its great�power status, which is built on its permanent
membership of the �� Security Council, its nuclear arsenal and its abundant
reserves of energy and raw materials. Russia is an important actor in the global
arena and in Europe, even though its in�uence varies by region and topic.
Russia’s international standing is affected by its ability to tackle its internal
challenges, such as an unbalanced economy, corruption which impedes
economic and administrative reform, bleak demographic trends as well as
shortcomings in the rule of law and the political system.

Russia keeps promoting a multilateral world order and it wants to be duly
recognised as a key actor in global policy. Russia underscores the principles of
state sovereignty and non�interference. In international con�icts Russia tries
to constrain international interventions and will not accept political change as
the goal of any intervention. Russia’s input in global governance is uneven, for
example in environmental and development questions.

The focus of Russia’s foreign policy lies in the area of the former Soviet �nion
where it aims to preserve or increase its in�uence. A signi�cant number of
Russians live in countries belonging to the Commonwealth of Independent
States �CIS�.

Russian foreign and security policy is built on the premise that the �nited States
and �AT� might challenge its sphere of in�uence and great power�status.
Russia’s military�political estimates emphasise its relationship with the �nited
States as well as the growing geostrategic importance of Asia, which does not
eliminate the importance of Europe to Russia’s wider security interests.

The �reset’ in the relationship between the �nited States and Russia was
pronounced in ����. The aim was to make progress in �S�Russian relations
on such matters in which consensus was considered achievable. The most
important achievement is the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty �START�,
which entered into force in ����. Furthermore, Russia opened its territory
to �AT� supply routes to Afghanistan, which will be of special importance
in the drawdown phase of �AT�’s ISAF operation �International Security
Assistance Force� and the implementation of the follow�on operation. Russia
has also participated in P����cooperation ��SA, ��, China, France, Russia
and Germany� in the diplomatic efforts with regard to Iran’s nuclear program.

32


-----

Russia’s long�sought membership of the World Trade �rganization �WT��
materialised in ���� with the support of the European �nion and the �nited
States.

Strategic missile defence continues to be the major point of dispute in �S�
Russian and, consequently, �AT��Russia relations. �o solution satisfying both
parties has been found. Russia and �AT� disagree in their estimates whether
the implementation of �AT�’s missile defence programme in its current form
could weaken Russia’s strategic deterrence in the future, thus altering the
balance of power. Russia’s demands of legally binding guarantees have not
been accepted by �AT� or the �nited States.

Russia’s major security challenges are along its southern borders as well as
in regions bedevilled by instability, con�ict and radicalisation related to the
rise of Islamist extremism. Despite the abolition of martial law the �orthern
Caucasus, especially Dagestan, remains volatile. At times the violence spills
over into other regions in Russia.

The rise of China is increasingly important to Russia’s security policy
considerations. Russia considers its relationship with China to be a strategic
partnership which is implemented bilaterally as well as multilaterally under
the auspices of the Shanghai Cooperation �rganisation �SC��. At the global
stage, especially in the �� Security Council, Russian and Chinese views often
converge.

Russia and China are rivals. China is strengthening its economic clout in Central
Asia. Due to the developments in Central Asia, Russia aims to strengthen the
signi�cance and standing of the Collective Security Treaty �rganisation �CST��,
which it leads, as a true actor in the region’s security architecture.

The Russian Far East is integrating into the China�led Asia�Paci�c economic
zone. Russia is concerned about the consequences of China’s economic and
demographic impact in the Russian Far East.

Russia promotes Eurasian economic integration which, in its �rst phase, has
materialised in a customs union between Russia, Belarus and �azakhstan.
Russia also wants the other CIS countries to join the customs union. Russia’s
long�term vision is a more deeply integrated Eurasian �nion modelled on the
E�, in which the Member States pursue a common monetary and foreign
exchange policy as well as economic policy.

33


-----

Russia and the E� are strategic partners and their mutual relationship, especially
in the area of the economy, is extensive. The E� is Russia’s biggest trading
partner and the most important market for its energy exports. Russia is also
the most important energy supplier for many E� countries. The exploitation of
shale gas in the �nited States and the increasing trade in lique�ed natural gas
impact Russia’s standing in the energy market. Russia often prefers to operate
bilaterally with the largest E� countries. Russia’s WT� membership opens
new vistas for intensi�ed trade relations and the modernisation of Russia’s
economy. Should Russia continue to deepen its wide�ranging cooperation with
the E� it might also better fare in its modernisation attempts. Furthermore,
Russia’s memberships of the G�� and the G� provide in�uential frames of
reference� they are also important to Russia for reasons of prestige.

###### Russia’s development

Whereas Russia’s economy survived the ����–���� crisis with the help of
its previously accumulated cash reserves and the recovering price of energy,
economic growth has been much more anaemic during this decade. Russia’s
economy continues to depend on the production and export of energy and raw
materials. The volume of oil and gas production is not expected to signi�cantly
increase.

Characteristic to Russia’s political system, the concentration of power on the
president will continue. Thus far this has been seen, among other things, in
the role of the parliament and the relatively minor role of political parties in
decision�making. The next federal election is scheduled for December ����.
Changes in the political system are expected to occur at regional and local
levels in the coming years. The reforms related to the registration of political
parties and the direct election of governors, launched during the previous
president’s administration, raised the citizens’ expectations of reforming the
centralised system. Progress, however, has been sluggish. In addition to the
democratisation process the citizens are concerned about the shortcomings in
the rule of law as well as the widespread corruption. Many are also worried
about the restrictions imposed on �G�s and the media, and the implementation
of the new legislation.

Russia continues to struggle with its demographic situation even though the
birth rate has risen to the average European level. During this decade the
working�age population will diminish by approximately nine million people.
While emigration is on the rise, fuelling Russia’s interest in protecting its citizens
abroad, immigration is also increasing in a situation in which Russia has already

34


-----

received more immigrants than any other country in Europe. Immigration is
one of the underlying causes for the growing nationalism in Russia.

Problems in the democratisation process, slower economic growth and the
continuing violence in the �orthern Caucasus motivate people to emigrate
from Russia. Consequently, Russian citizens comprise one of the largest groups
of asylum�seekers in the area of the European �nion.

Spurred by the economic growth the proportion of the middle class is growing.
�evertheless, inequalities in income and disparities between regions remain
large compared to those in Europe. The population and well�being are
converging in Moscow, St Petersburg and other large cities. Peripheral areas,
especially in the north and the east, are facing the risk of atrophy.

When it comes to Russia’s opposition groups, the western media most often
takes notice of the actors who support liberal western values. Still, nationalists
and communists also have a strong voice in Russia’s opposition. The
opposition forces are not united under any conspicuous leader. The popularity
of the different parties will be determined by the elections in the coming
years. It will also be seen whether the opposition forces integrate into the
conventional political party system if free political competition is considered
to be unattainable. The goal of the most recent protest movement has been
to achieve a society which is built on extensive participation and in�uencing,
rather than on a top�down authoritarian system.

###### The United Nations and the new groupings

The central role of the �nited �ations in the international system is based on
its unique status of encompassing practically all countries of the world as its
members. In recent years the Security Council has also assumed a greater role
in con�ict prevention and resolution, and in legitimising the use of force under
international law, even though its composition does not properly re�ect the
present power balance.

The �nited �ations will continue to remain the generally recognised forum
for discussing and resolving global and international problems. �o other
organisation or alliance can replace the role of the ��. The Security Council
has remarkably stepped up its performance since the end of the Cold War.
�onetheless, in recent years there have been some challenges regarding
the functioning of the Council. �� Member States must demonstrate more
determined common leadership and increasingly consistent commitment to
strengthen the capacity of the organisation.

35


-----

The purpose of the �nited �ations is to maintain international peace and
security. �nder international law, the key principles for the use of force are
included in the �� Charter. The basic premise is that the use of force is
prohibited except for the purpose of self�defence or under �� Security Council
mandate. The European �nion, �AT�, the African �nion and other regional
actors are developing their cooperation with the ��. The �� is vitally important
to the development of comprehensive security.

The Responsibility to Protect �R�P or RtoP� principle, adopted by the �nited
�ations General Assembly in ����, rose to the centre of the international
agenda following the events in Libya and the Ivory Coast. The situation in
Libya in ���� was the �rst time the Security Council issued a mandate for the
use of force in accordance with the RtoP principle. The operation in Libya also
generated political discord with regard to the application of the Security Council
Resolution’s mandate. This may affect the way in which the RtoP principle will
be applied in the future as well as the general manner by which demanding
crisis management operations will be handled in the �� Security Council.

When it comes to groups outside the �� system the G��� has played an
important role in questions related to economic and monetary policy. It has
also shown initiative in various security�related themes such as the prevention
of proliferation of WMDs and counter�terrorist action.

The signi�cance of the G��, encompassing the major economic powers, has
grown. This was particularly evident in controlling the economic crisis which
began in ����. The G�� has managed to coordinate economic policy and
international �nancial supervision. Its activities have evolved from economic
topics to other global issues such as climate policy. From the standpoint of
multilateral cooperation the development of the relationship between the
G�� and the ��, including its agencies, will be important. The decisions
taken by the G�� will ultimately be implemented by states and established
international organisations. Still, the �� can issue global authorisations to the
G��’s decisions. The E� participates in the activities of the G�� and the G���,
represented by the President of the European Commission and the President
of the European Council.

While the BRICS countries �Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa� are
established as a concept, the group’s approaches and goals have not become
fully established. The BRICS countries have differing views regarding the focus
of their activities, their role and ambitions. Russia is trying to strengthen the
political role of the BRICS group as a part of the multilateral world order. The
BRICS countries are not a cohesive group as regards values.

Regional organisations are important, especially in the �eld of trade and
economic cooperation. Particularly the African integration organisations
such as the African �nion, the Economic Community of West African States
�EC�WAS� and the Southern African Development Community �SADC� have
made great progress in political and security questions. They bear considerable
responsibility over the continent’s security policy. In the Asia�Paci�c region the
Association of Southeast Asian �ations �ASEA�� and the Asian Regional Forum
�ARF� have raised their status.

Conclusions

From the Finnish standpoint the future global role of the E� will be of
special importance. It is in Finland’s interests to advance the E�’s global
capacity and role, and its cohesion in every possible way.

It is important for Finland to closely monitor the great powers’ political
and economic development and shifts in their strategic orientation. It
is equally important that Finland develop close bilateral relations with
them.

It is also important that Finland develop its multilateral cooperation with
the key international actors. The �� provides a unique forum for the
management of international questions. Finland’s in�uence in global
groupings outside the �� structure, such as in the G�� and the G���,
will materialise through its E� membership.

A robust and well�functioning multilateral system based on cooperation
is important to Finland. It is imperative that the �nited States commit
to strengthening it.

Closer economic ties between the E� and the �SA, including the
negotiations on a free trade agreement, would strengthen both
economies and support the development of an international, rules�
based trade regime.

It is particularly important for Finland to assess Russia’s political
development and the goals of its international action. Finland invests in
its relationship with Russia both bilaterally and through its involvement
in the E�, including support for a new E��Russia Agreement.

The importance of E� cohesion is accentuated in the E�’s external
relations. From the Finnish standpoint cohesive action is particularly
important in E��Russian relations.

The Finnish�Russian arctic partnership creates the framework for
charting mutual interest, establishing contacts for handling questions
related to comprehensive security and achieving results. Russia is also
the most important market for Finnish arctic know�how. �ortheast

Passage cooperation has been discussed within the framework of the
Partnership.

The �ordic countries are the natural reference group for Finland. �n a
global scale Finland, like the other �ordic countries, is one of the most
successful and stable western democracies. The �ordic welfare state
model, built on a competitive economy and a high rate of employment
as well as equal services and care, has proved to be an attractive social
system. It is essential that Finland preserve the strengths of this model.

**The Responsibility to Protect principle**

The Responsibility to Protect (RtoP) is a political commitment adopted by UN Member States
in 2005. Its purpose is to protect civilians from genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes
and ethnic cleansing. The basic principles of the RtoP are: 1) The State carries the primary
responsibility for protecting populations from the aforementioned crimes; 2) The international
community has a responsibility to encourage and assist States in fulfilling this responsibility;
and 3) If a State is manifestly failing to protect its populations, the international community
must be prepared to take collective action to protect populations. While the primary means
are intended to be peaceful, using the instruments available in Chapters VI-VIII of the Charter
of the United Nations, should they prove insufficient the Security Council can also mandate
the use of military force for this purpose. This may entail a temporary violation of a state’s
territorial sovereignty. Even though the RtoP principle is not a binding legal standard on states
or individuals, it carries moral authority as a guiding principle in organisations’ multilateral
diplomacy and crisis management, especially when it comes to the UN.

In 2011 the UN Security Council mandated military interventions in Libya and the Ivory Coast
with Resolutions 1973 and 1975, both of which referred to the RtoP principle.

In the autumn of 2011 Brazil made the initiative on Responsibility while Protecting. Its
purpose is to create mechanisms that establish some ground rules for the implementation of
RtoP and the use of military force.

In order to consolidate the RtoP concept it is important that the RtoP be actively and primarily
implemented through peaceful means, in accordance with Chapter VI. Should these prove
insufficient, the instruments available in Chapter VII could be invoked. In addition, in the
future the role of regional organisations in implementing the RtoP and, to a larger extent, in
advancing human security, will continue to grow.

###### 1.3 Military power and arms control

 The changing character of war

While the threat of large�scale armed aggression has diminished, it cannot
categorically be ruled out over the long term. Military force can also be
employed in a limited fashion in regional and internal con�icts, and as an
instrument of power projection. Even an extensive use of force in the future

38


-----

will not necessarily translate into seizing and occupying large land areas. The
adversary may attempt to achieve his goals by using force unexpectedly, and
by rapidly seizing limited key areas. The defender’s early�warning window and
the period available for raising readiness will shrink.

In addition to the military means, warfare will simultaneously incorporate
different asymmetric means as well as political, economic and military
pressure, various forms of information and cyber warfare, and combinations
thereof. Chronologically speaking, hostilities can already begin in peacetime
with psychological and information operations. This increasingly blurs the line
between political pressure and warfare. �ew technologies will not necessarily
replace most traditional means of warfare. �evertheless, technology will create
new possibilities for waging war. The western countries have widely adopted a
network�centric defence concept built on ICT technology which enhances joint
situation awareness, rapid decision�making, joint effect and interoperability.
The aim is to compensate for the suddenness of crises and the fog of battle by
improving prognostication, situation awareness and the situation picture as well
as the intelligence and analysis capacity. Particularly the use of ICT systems
also generates signi�cant knock�on effects such as system vulnerability and
incurred costs.

The options for non�state actors increase with the development of dual�use
technology and society’s growing vulnerability. It will be increasingly dif�cult to
identify the sources of threats and perpetrators, especially in the information
space and cyberspace. The entire society will be the target of the attack, rather
than the armed forces alone.

The tempo of future military operations will be rapid and their progression
will be dif�cult to predict. Troops will be increasingly mobile, possessing more
�repower and improved range and accuracy of �re. Critical military capabilities
will include intelligence and surveillance systems, the capabilities of the air
force, the navy and special forces. �nmanned aerial vehicles will be developed
for intelligence and surveillance and, to a growing extent, as platforms for
precision�guided munitions.

As a result of the increasing proportion of regular military personnel in the
armed forces the number of troops will decrease. However, the troops will be
much more deployable in contrast to the units in conscript�based systems.
�evertheless, defence cuts will increase the importance of the reserves. In
addition to achieving savings niche expertise, needed in complex crises, can
be recruited from the reserves.

39


-----

As the nature of con�ict changes and technological options multiply
the development of, and compliance with, international obligations and
humanitarian law in armed con�icts require closer monitoring and attention.
This also affects the international acceptability of weapon systems and their
availability in the international market. The changing nature of con�ict will
make it increasingly challenging to protect the civilian population.

###### Development of armed forces

While the threat of a global great�power con�ict remains low regional, local
and internal con�icts pop up continually. They increasingly include non�state
actors. Prolonged unresolved con�icts do not only cause casualties, they also
result in civilian casualties and carry the risk of escalation.

The end of the Cold War over two decades ago reduced defence spending
globally. However, at the turn of the ��st Century defence appropriations
began to climb again. Still, the current economic crisis causes outright cuts
or lower growth in defence spending, especially in Western Europe. Contrary
to this development, the defence budgets of Russia, Sweden, �orway and
Estonia – Finland’s neighbours – are on the rise.

In most European countries the development of armed forces is increasingly
geared towards international crisis management. Western Europe has, by and
large, abolished general conscription. �et, on many other continents armed
forces are still being developed with an emphasis on territorial defence and the
capabilities for a large�scale use of force. The western countries will primarily
carry out their territorial defence through alliance�based defence solutions.
This means that their armed forces will have had to develop the capability
of participating in multinational joint operations outside their own area, if
necessary.

The �S spending cuts aimed at reducing the increasing debt will also impact
defence budgets during the next decade. �wing to the end of the operations in
Iraq and Afghanistan the combined effect of the savings will probably translate
to zero growth in defence spending. �onetheless, the �nited States will
retain its overwhelming global military supremacy. The reductions will focus,
especially on the Army as the �nited States, in line with the ���� strategic
guidance for the Department of Defense, will no longer maintain the ability to
�ght two sustained large�scale wars at once, and will be cautious about future
participation in large�scale and prolonged crisis management operations.

40


-----

In conjunction with the cuts the �S armed forces will be developed to be
increasingly mobile, �exible and deployable. The strategic focus is shifting to
the Asia�Paci�c region. The signi�cance of global commons will grow in �S
strategy, aiming at guaranteeing the freedom of transport routes critical to
trade. Additional resources will be allocated, among other things, to cyber
defence and space�based systems as well as intelligence and missile defence.
The �nited States will continue to be the leading source of defence technology
and R&D in the future as well.

The �nited States has increased its military predominance in relation to its
European �AT� Allies, especially in its ability to execute large�scale operations
and develop and use expensive and advanced capabilities. Within the
spheres of �AT� burden�sharing also carries a political attribute in addition
to the practical one. The �nited States pays particular attention to this. The
European allies contribute less and less to the sum total and their defence
G�P�shares have been diminishing. The operation in Libya clearly revealed
the shortcomings in European capabilities. Even though the operation was
carried out under European leadership, it could not be implemented without
�S strategic capabilities such as airlift, air�refuelling and C�I systems.

Even though the nuclear capability has dramatically lost its relative importance
in �S thinking in the post�Cold War era, the �nited States intends to modernise
its strategic arsenal in the coming decade. The �nited States will also develop
its conventional long�range weapons arsenal so as to enable precision�guided
strikes.

The growth of defence spending in China and Russia, the countries with the
next largest defence budgets after the �nited States, continuously exceeds the
growth of their respective national economies. From the military standpoint
China is a regional great power which also uses regional interests as well as
a growing need to guarantee the maritime transports and availability of raw
materials as a backdrop to its military programme. China develops its armed
forces in many �elds, concentrating speci�cally on state�of�the�art capabilities.
These include missile technology and aircraft carriers, stealth �ghters, space
technology and the cyber domain. China also aims to modernise and increase
the number of its strategic warheads.

Russia’s strategic goal is to restore an internationally recognised military great�
power status. It has launched a comprehensive weapons and equipment
modernisation programme. According to the plans one third of state
appropriations will be earmarked for the defence and internal security in the
coming years. The plan is to allocate approximately E�R ��� billion alone to

41


-----

weapons procurements by ����. The focus will be on the nuclear arsenal as
well as air and space�based defence systems.

As per its military doctrine Russia also reserves the right to use pre�emptive
force and defend its citizens outside its own territory. Russia will be developing
numerically smaller, yet more deployable and modernised armed forces. The
goal is to improve the speed, range and accuracy of capabilities and weapon
systems. Russia, too, is developing its cyber warfare capacity.


The bulk of Russia’s armed forces are positioned in the �orthern Caucasus and
in strategically vital areas such as Moscow and the Far East. When necessary,
the troops are redeployed in accordance with the centre of gravity. Troop
transfers are an integral element of strategic exercises in Russia.

�uclear weapons in operational readiness are the essence of Russia’s strategic
deterrence in the ����s. The pronounced role of the nuclear arsenal in Russia’s
military doctrine will continue well into the future. �uclear weapon systems
have also been systematically developed through various military programmes.


�nited �ingdom and France, the fourth and �fth largest defence spenders, as
well as many other European countries have cut their defence appropriations
since the onset of the economic crisis in ����.

###### Development of multinational defence cooperation

As the �nited States is shifting its foreign and security policy focus from Europe
to Asia, European countries are forced to assume more responsibility over their
own security. This is the latest step in the process which began as soon as the
Cold War ended. �evertheless, it is impossible to increase the responsibility
and role of Europe without closer defence cooperation. As appropriations
continue to diminish countries are less able to independently generate all of
the required military capabilities. A completely independent national defence
is no longer a viable concept. Collaborative capability development as well as
pooling and sharing have become important political and military goals.

The challenges also impact the �eld of defence materiel. In addition to the
common security and defence policy the European �nion seeks solutions by
developing the single market.

Participation in this cooperation is voluntary and countries make case�by�case
decisions regarding the projects and their input. Actual projects are launched
at the behest of willing partners in different country groupings. The European
�nion and �AT� coordinate and facilitate said cooperation. Whereas the �nion
calls this approach �Pooling & Sharing’, �AT� calls it �Smart Defence’. As a
Member State of the E� and a �AT� partner Finland participates in both of
them. Consequently, defence cooperation does not imply military alliance
or any changes in Finland’s fundamental security policy solutions. �ordic
Defence Cooperation ���RDEFC�� is an example of a well�functioning regional
collaborative arrangement.

In practice, cooperation can cover various functions, ranging from
training, exercises and capability development to common operations. The
interdependence arising from various joint projects advances the commitment
of participants and promotes the access to capabilities when needed.

The advantages of cooperation should not only be evaluated from the standpoint
of short�term results and cost�savings. To a large extent cooperative ventures
are only at an early stage, and states have differing views and expectations
regarding the terms and goals of cooperation. Moreover, divergent defence
solutions, dissimilar legislation and practices as well as industrial policy factors
impact the content and scheduling of cooperation.

Pooling and sharing projects have already created tangible results. An example
of a well�functioning joint project involves the Strategic Airlift Capability
cooperation, in which twelve countries, Finland and Sweden included, share
acquisition and operating costs for three strategic C��� transport aircraft. A

43


-----

speci�c challenge in the future concerns the sharing of capabilities in which
a country will rely on the capabilities of another country or other countries.
Emphasis on national sovereignty and uncertainty over access to shared
capabilities in the hour of need are challenges to such cooperation. This applies
to allied and non�allied states alike. When it comes to, especially, non�allied
countries, the abolishment of critical defence capabilities would require the
creation of binding agreements.

Training and exercises of troops and units is an integral part of capability
development. In recent years combined joint interoperability has been
maintained and developed, especially in �peration ISAF in Afghanistan.
It will be important to maintain the level of interoperability and guarantee
the dissemination of the lessons�learned. The level of performance and
interoperability needed in multinational operations, as per international
standards and practices, can only be attained by regularly participating in
demanding multinational training and exercises.

The signi�cance of, in particular, multinational response forces, such as the
E� Battle Groups �E�BG� and the �AT� Response Force ��RF�, will become
increasingly important in the coming years as vehicles for the development
of interoperability and armed forces transformation. Response forces pools
represent the pinnacle of multinational capabilities, and their practices and
training as well as evaluation and certi�cation methods are constantly being
updated in accordance with future challenges and the lessons�learned from
operations. This also has real meaning regarding the composition of the units
deployed to future crisis management operations.

The E� battle groups are relatively small units, comprising � ��� � � ���
troops. The E� has two battle groups on a standby period of � months, ready
for deployment. The E�BG can be used independently or as a part of a larger
crisis management operation. The battle groups facilitate a rapid E� military
response to a crisis. They must be able to start implementing the operation
on the ground within ten days of unanimous approval from the Council. Their
tasks include con�ict prevention, separation of parties by force, humanitarian
and rescue tasks, post�con�ict stabilisation, and military advice and assistance
tasks. Even though the E�’s battle groups are yet to be deployed, the
implementation of the Battlegroup Concept has markedly intensi�ed European
cooperation at the practical level, and improved the interoperability of troops.

The �AT� Response Force ��RF� comprises an operational command and
control element, the Immediate Response Force �IRF� and the so�called
Response Forces Pool �RFP�. The command and control element and the IRF

44


-----

must be able to deploy within ���� days of a decision. Troops in the RFP can
supplement the IRF when necessary. �nits in the RFP must be deployable
within ����� days. Whilst they are not tied to any standby rosters they can
participate in the standby troops’ training and exercises. Should the �AT�
Response Force be deployed to an operation, the Response Forces Pool would
mainly supplement any shortcomings in the Immediate Response Force’s
capabilities.

The participation of �AT� partners in the activities of the �RF is always
supplementary in nature. The partner country can independently determine its
unit’s readiness to deploy ������ days�. Partner participation in �RF activities
does not signify any commitment to potential operations. Rather, any possible
deployment to an operation always requires a separate national decision.

E�BG cooperation and �AT�’s �RF activities are mutually reinforcing: they
develop the very same troops and capabilities and utilise �AT� standards,
exercises, evaluation and certi�cation processes. For their part they also
support the goals of �� crisis management. After all, the �� wishes that
regional organisations, especially the E� and �AT�, develop rapid response
capabilities.

The European �nion, �AT�, bilateral and regional collaborative arrangements
�incl. ��RDEFC�� are not rivals as regards capability development. �verlapping
participation ensures the elimination of unnecessary duplication, and that said
collaborative venues complement each other.

**Multinational capability development cooperation:**
**EU’s Pooling & Sharing and NATO’s Smart Defence**

European states, irrespective of their defence solutions, are increasingly dependent on
multinational defence cooperation when it comes to maintaining, developing and using
military capabilities. The EU and NATO set the framework for said cooperation. Practical
cooperation on individual capabilities often occurs in smaller country groupings under the
tutelage of EU or NATO, in country groupings (including regional groupings) or bilaterally. The
collaborative fora do not compete with each other, rather, they are mutually reinforcing. More
often than not it is easier to cooperate at the practical level in smaller country groupings.

The Member States of the EU and NATO have a long tradition of cooperation in the
maintenance, development and use of capabilities. The economic crisis and the attempts
of the Europeans to assume more responsibility over their own security have spurred the
intensification of cooperation. For their part, these factors have lifted the cooperation from
the technical level onto the political agenda as well. Whereas the EU calls this cooperation
‘Pooling and Sharing’ (P&S), in NATO it is known as ‘Smart Defence’.

###### Weapons of mass destruction and arms control

While a Cold War�style confrontation between the nuclear powers has vanished,
the proliferation of �ssile material and nuclear weapons continues to be a
serious global threat. The fact that the parties to certain regional con�icts
possess nuclear weapons increases the tension. For the nuclear powers, their
nuclear arsenals are the essence of their defence strategies and great�power
status.

The �nited States, Russia, France, the �nited �ingdom and China are nuclear
powers recognised by the Treaty on the �on�Proliferation of �uclear Weapons

46


-----

��PT�. India and Pakistan, choosing to remain outside the treaty as well as
�orth �orea which withdrew from the �PT also possess nuclear weapons.
In addition, Israel, a non�party to the treaty, is generally believed to hold a
nuclear arsenal.

According to estimates Iran is further developing its capacity and facilities to
the extent that it can acquire a nuclear weapons capability if it chooses to
do so. In addition to intelligence estimates the reports of the International
Atomic Energy Agency �IAEA� point towards this. For a long time already the
international community has tried to resolve the situation through negotiations
and by imposing sanctions on Iran. �n top of the sanctions of the �� Security
Council the E� and �SA, among others, have imposed autonomous sanctions
on it. The international community is particularly worried about the possibility
of a unilateral strike as an attempted solution to the problem, and that several
other countries in the region might want to follow Iran’s example should it
succeed in acquiring a nuclear capability. Iran must be able to address the
international community’s justi�ed concerns over its ultimate intentions.

Despite continuing efforts �orth �orea has refused to abolish its nuclear
weapons programme or limit any related research and development. The
growth of internal instability in Pakistan increases concern over the control of
its nuclear arsenal.

The goal of a nuclear weapon�free world has increasingly entered the
international agenda in recent years. The new START treaty between the
�nited States and Russia is a major achievement. Then again, no negotiations
have been conducted over the reduction of Russia’s and �AT�’s tactical nuclear
weapons in Europe.

In ����, the European �nion adopted a strategy against the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction, which includes the commitment to a multilateralist
approach to non�proliferation and disarmament.

The �PT regulates the non�proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear
disarmament as well as the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Despite serious
challenges to the treaty it is of central importance. The treaty has failed to
prevent the emergence of new nuclear powers and the established nuclear
powers have not been ready to effectively advance nuclear disarmament.
Military R&D has been conducted under the guise of peaceful use of nuclear
energy. The efforts on the universalisation of the �PT continue.

47


-----

The decision to convene a conference on the establishment of a Middle East
zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction was
made at the ���� Review Conference of the �PT. The international community
authorised Finland to facilitate the conference.

Biological threats, including biological weapons, constitute one of the greatest
global security threats. The dual�use nature of biological agents as well as rapid
scienti�c and technological progress pose challenges to the non�proliferation
of these threats. Many countries’ civilian and military authorities have begun
to invest in the prevention of bio�threats. Cooperation between national and
international health and security authorities is imperative to prevent these
threats.

Chemical weapons, perceived as a more traditional problem, will also remain
a threat. The authorities must also prepare for new types of challenges and
threats, such as incapacitating chemical agents, in addition to existing agents
and weapons.

Further efforts to strengthen the Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention
and the Chemical Weapons Convention �CWC� and to widen the base of their
signatories will continue. The total ban of these weapons is based on widely
rati�ed agreements and customary international law requires more robust
treaty monitoring mechanisms as well as frank international dialogue and
exchange of information so as to guarantee the timeliness and coverage of
norms alongside technological progress.

A growing concern is nuclear weapons or dangerous materials related to WMDs
ending up in the hands of new states or non�state actors. Helping fragile states
comply with their international obligations and engaging in cooperation related
to the control of transporting dangerous materials is useful when it comes to
nuclear non�proliferation and preventing the spread of other WMDs.

As with the non�proliferation of WMDs, disarmament and arms control also
continue with regard to conventional weapons so as to preserve existing
achievements and to take on new obligations, both globally and regionally. The
progress is slow and, in spite of the efforts, it is possible that some standards
may weaken.

Comprehensive regulation of the international arms trade, the ambition of the
Arms Trade Treaty �ATT� yet to be �nalised, is an important new goal. The illicit
spread of small arms and shortcomings in the regulation of arms trade are

48


-----

signi�cant problems. Whereas their effects are most apparent in developing
countries, they also manifest themselves globally.

Arms control standards are becoming increasingly robust and the development
echoes the strong in�uence of the �G�s. Examples of this include the
implementation and regional expansion of the �ttawa Convention banning
anti�personnel landmines as well as the �slo Convention regarding the
regulation of cluster munitions. The fact that many major military powers are
not planning to accede to these treaties is a continuing problem.

International export control arrangements on conventional weapons and dual�
use technology, nuclear technology as well as the transfer of technology and
know�how related to biological and chemical weapons are elemental features
of the arms control regime. The arrangements maintained by the producing
and supplying states are based on a political understanding. An internationally
controversial decision from the recent past involves the fact that the nuclear
technology�producing countries consented to allowing cooperation with India,
despite it being a non�party to the �PT.

Conclusions

Finland estimates that the prerequisites and usefulness of traditional power
politics have decreased in the present environment of interdependence.
However, power politics cannot be categorically ruled out, but rather
must be prepared for. It is increasingly important to prevent and solve
regional, local and internal con�icts through international cooperation.

While the threat of large�scale armed aggression has diminished, military
force can still be employed in a limited fashion in regional and internal
con�icts, and as an instrument of power projection. Simultaneously,
the options for non�state actors are multiplying due to advances in
technology, and through the progressively more vulnerable societies.

Future military operations will be increasingly mobile and unpredictable,
and the range and accuracy of �re will improve. In addition to traditional
military action, operations will incorporate different asymmetric means
such as various forms of information and cyber warfare as well as
political, economic and military pressure, and combinations thereof.
This will be taken into consideration in the development and use of the
defence capability.

Finland considers the development of a multilateral international
capability cooperation to be essential. Finland participates in capability
cooperation on complementary fora, such as ��RDEFC�, the E� and
�AT� partnership, and through bilateral arrangements. Comprehensive
participation in multilateral cooperation ensures Finland’s in�uence in

49


-----

decisions that are taken on new �elds of cooperation, procedures and
structures.

Since ���� Finland has participated four times in the E� battle groups’
standby periods, and continues to participate in E� battle group
cooperation.

Since ���� Finland has participated in activities supplementing the
�AT� Response Force, and in exercises. In addition, since ���� Finland
has regularly designated units in the Response Forces Pool �RFP� from
its military crisis management troop register. In ���� Finland assigned
a Deployable CBR� Laboratory to the RFP. In ���� the contribution to
the pool will include an army Special �perations Task Group, followed by
an air force F��� �ghter squadron in ����, and a navy Amphibious Task
�nit in ����. The units will be assigned to the pool in accordance with
the defence establishment’s plan.

From the Finnish perspective the intensifying European defence materiel
cooperation is useful. The development of the E�’s single market defence
materiel sector has been a natural development in the increasingly
competitive international marketplace.

Advancing all sectors of the �PT and the non�proliferation of WMDs,
requires a strong commitment and robust collaborative arrangements
from the international community.

###### 1.4 International crisis management

 Crisis management actors

Crises are often complex with regard to their origin and appearance. Their
comprehensive management requires a continuum of various measures,
ranging from crisis prevention, mediation and conciliation to possible military
stabilisation and the transfer of ownership to local actors, and to the creation

51


-----

of prerequisites for continuous development by means of civilian crisis
management and development policy.

The �nited �ations has a central role in mandating international crisis
management operations. A �� mandate is also emphasised when decisions
are taken on E� and �AT��led crisis management operations.

�nited �ations�led crisis management, known as peacekeeping in ��
terminology, has increased and has been particularly focused in Africa. The
signi�cance of the African �nion and other regional organisations on the
continent has risen in the management of crises in Africa. The input of the
Arab League was politically crucial in launching the ���mandated operation
in Libya. Also the emerging powers, India, South Africa, Indonesia, Brazil and
China, have increased their participation in �� crisis management operations,
albeit choosing to abstain from a leading political role.

���led crisis management is comprehensively being developed. It combines
military and police activities with wide�ranging civilian action. The �� Security
Council also increasingly deals with the position of women in con�icts and in
con�ict resolution, questions related to the protection of children, and civilians
in general as well as issues related to the rule of law as part of the attempts to
resolve armed con�icts. �� action also exhibits the determination to increase
the responsibility of regional and other international organisations. This is
accentuated in extremely demanding crisis management operations.

As part of its common security and defence policy the E� has demonstrated
the capacity to independently carry out civilian and military crisis management
operations, for example in the Western Balkans, the Horn of Africa and
Afghanistan. The E� is a pioneer in civilian crisis management, especially,
and focuses on police activities and on strengthening the rule of law and
civilian governance. These days the E�’s military crisis management also
covers military training. The E�’s comprehensive approach aims to utilise
development and trade policies, humanitarian assistance, political dialogue
and crisis management in the E�’s action so that the policy areas are mutually
reinforcing. The goal of this approach is to improve the effectiveness of E�
action. �et another goal of crisis management is to develop civil�military
cooperation and the synergies therein.

The E� continues to develop crisis management cooperation with third
countries. For example, the E� and the �nited States have signed a framework
agreement under which American civilian personnel can participate in E�
crisis management operations. Due to the lack of progress in the negotiations

52


-----

for a framework agreement, Russian participation in E� crisis management
cooperation has hitherto been based on ad hoc arrangements.

The expectations on European leadership and overall responsibility in military
crisis management continue to mount. Simultaneously the importance
of European capability cooperation grows. �AT� standards, criteria and
regulations are of central importance in military crisis management. Moreover,
the E� and �AT� have agreed in principle that the E� can make use of �AT�’s
strategic capabilities in its military crisis management operations. However, the
unresolved question regarding Cyprus hampers E���AT� security and defence
policy cooperation as well as practical collaboration.

���mandated international crisis management operations have become one
of �AT�’s main tasks. As demonstrated by the operations in Afghanistan, the
Western Balkans and Libya, �AT� can broadly in�uence international politics
through crisis management operations. Due to its resources and capacity �AT�
is the most important actor in implementing demanding crisis management
operations. �AT� is also developing a limited pool of civilian crisis management
experts for the purpose of improving its cooperation capability with other
actors in crisis management.

The �rganization for Security and Co�operation in Europe ��SCE� plays a
particular role in con�ict prevention. Its �eld operations have added special
value to the work of the organisation.

###### Crisis management environments

The new crisis management environments are often more demanding than
those of the past. The use of asymmetric means such as terrorism, sabotage
and information warfare is on the rise, which makes it more dif�cult for the
international community to stabilise con�ict areas. This has been demonstrated
in Afghanistan and Somalia. The effectiveness of international action demands
increasing coordination, consistency and perseverance, and a comprehensive
approach.

Crisis management participation is a vehicle for international burden�sharing,
raising international clout and improving competence. Participation in
international burden�sharing strengthens the prospects of receiving assistance
in a crisis.

53


-----

Crisis management tasks are becoming all the more demanding and expensive.
When decisions are taken with regard to participation, the fact that risks against
personnel in crisis management tasks have risen must be taken into account.

Military crisis management operations call for versatile capabilities which are
technologically advanced, �exible and interoperable. Rapid deployability is
nowadays of the essence in crisis response, and its demands must increasingly
be taken into account. Military budget cuts and structural changes require
the proper allocation of resources and comprehensive planning in crisis
management, as well.

Likewise, the development of capabilities and adequate resources are topical
questions in civilian crisis management. It is a speci�c challenge to second
professional civilian crisis management experts from various �elds to a crisis
area on short notice while taking into account the region’s speci�c demands.
As operating environments are becoming more and more demanding, the
requirements for civilian crisis management capabilities are also growing with
regard to training, recruitment, personal kit and logistics. The role of private
security and defence contractors in the different phases of con�icts and post�
con�ict reconstruction is on the rise. This creates new types of problems.
Finland, like many other states, is politically committed to the so�called
Montreux Document, which deals with the responsibilities of states and good
practices in ensuring compliance with humanitarian law and human rights law
in the activities of private military and security companies.

Conclusions

Wide�ranging participation in international crisis management ���, E�,
�AT� and the �SCE� is a central element of Finland’s foreign, security
and defence policy. A �� mandate, comprehensiveness and the mutual
complementariness of civilian and military action have had a central
position in Finland’s crisis management activities.

The development of the European �nion’s crisis management
strengthens its credibility as a global actor. Through its wide range of
instruments the E� provides added value, and its potential synergies
should be developed and fully exploited in crisis areas.

Finland develops its crisis management capabilities by participating in
multinational training and exercises organised by the E�, �AT� and its
Member States and partners. The topics can also include emergency
and disaster�related exercises or decision�making and consultation
exercises.

#### 2 Europe’s security development and the key actors

###### 2.1 Overall development of Europe’s security

Even though the security situation in Europe is generally stable, instability
factors do exist in its neighbourhood, in Europe’s different regions and inside
the E�. The European �nion has made a crucial difference in spreading the
zone of democracy and the increasingly wealthy free market in Europe. The
expanding commitment to the rule of law and the respect for democracy
and human rights has increased European unity and bolstered its economic,
societal and security development.

The prospect of E� enlargement has visibly spurred on economic, social and
political reforms in countries seeking E� membership. E� enlargement has
functioned as a peace project in the Western Balkans. Following Croatia’s
accession to the E� in ���� the enlargement process will continue elsewhere
in the Western Balkans as well as with Iceland and Turkey. The E�’s appeal can
justi�ably be expected to positively impact its neighbourhood, irrespective of
the membership prospects of the countries located in its neighbourhood. This
entails the preservation of the political will to offer E� membership to countries
meeting the required criteria, and to further deepen relations in the European
neighbourhood.

The European �eighbourhood Policy �E�P� and the Eastern Partnership aim
to increase stability in the neighbourhood of the �nion. The E�P provides
for versatile relationships and offers new possibilities for in�uencing the
development of many regions.

As a result of developments in the security environment �AT� is increasingly
focused on functioning as a wide�ranging security organisation that engages
in crisis management activities. �AT� sustains and promotes security and
stability in Europe. �AT� continues to keep its doors open to new members
and, in the coming years, the focus of the accession process will be focused in
the Western Balkans. The accession process of Georgia is unlikely to proceed
quickly, even though Georgia retains membership prospects. The present
government of �kraine is not seeking membership in �AT�.

Russia’s views affect the development of European security. Preserving its
in�uence in its neighbourhood is an essential element of its great�power status,
which is also echoed in E��Russian and �AT��Russia relationships. Even though
the �SCE continues to provide the opportunities for the creation of a pan�
European security community, no signi�cant steps have recently been taken.

56


-----

Conclusions

It is in Finland’s interests to support European and transatlantic security
cooperation, especially within the framework of the E� and the �SCE,
and in cooperation with �AT�. �S commitment to European security
and stability advances the security of the entire continent.

The societal and political development and the well�being of the �nion’s
neighbourhood are important for European security� the �nion’s wide
and extensive collaborative networks bolster this development.

###### 2.2 The present state of the European Union and its influence  in its neighbourhood

The role of the European �nion as the model of prosperity and societal stability
as well as being the promoter of the continent’s security and uni�cation
processes is central. However, the global �nancial crisis has turned into a
protracted European recession. The economic crisis saps the �nion’s cohesion
and weakens its credibility as a leading actor.

The politically painful austerity measures have also encountered resistance and
in�uenced public opinion. The essence of the �nion as a historical uni�cation,
peace and stability process in Europe has become blurred in the eyes of many
citizens. The economic crisis has created unnecessary political division within
the E�.

Economic growth, competitiveness, employment, a robust public economy and
social well�being establish the foundation for the abovementioned issues. They
are increasingly important security policy questions, de�ning the international
capacity and the standing of the Member States and the �nion.

Through the Lisbon Treaty progress has been made on the common security
and defence policy. E� crisis management operations have a central role. In
addition, political commitment to the development of capability cooperation
has increased. �evertheless, the �nion is not developing any features leading
towards a collective defence. The solidarity clause and the mutual assistance
clause included in the Treaty of Lisbon strengthen the character of the �nion
as a security community. While there has been some discussion regarding the
implementation of the solidarity clause, the Member States have not discussed
the manner in which the mutual assistance obligation would be implemented.
Regarding this, the international obligations on the non�forti�cation and
neutralisation of the Åland Islands are also taken into account in Finland.

57


-----

The eastern and southern neighbourhood is the focal area of the �nion’s
external relations where the E� widely applies its political, economic and
development policy instruments. The European �eighbourhood Policy also
strengthens Europe’s security. This involves regions possessing global strategic
importance such as the Middle East and �orthern Africa. The European �nion
and the countries on the southern rim of the Mediterranean as well as Eastern
Europe and the Southern Caucasus have wide�ranging partnerships.

Even though the transition in the countries of the southern rim of the
Mediterranean spawned from internal factors, rather than at the behest of
the E�, the values represented by the �nion have been at the heart of the
evolution. The �nion continues to play a central role in supporting the region’s
societies as they develop their economic, social and political structures.

The E�’s southern neighbours are in a period of profound transition, which
may entail long�lasting effects. The democracy movements in �orthern Africa
and the Middle East may cause a long period of uncertainty and instability. The
democratisation processes vary from country to country and concurrently the
power relations in the region are undergoing a massive transformation. The
relative weakening of the in�uence of the �nited States in the area has already
resulted in increasing rivalry between the states in the region.

The forms and results of the democratisation process spawned by the Arab
Spring vary. The role of political Islam is on the rise, exposing its many facets.
The rivalry between moderates and radicals may intensify and could result in
a reversion of civil liberties and women’s rights.

The stalled peace process between Israel and the Palestinians diminishes the
prospects of implementing the two�state model, increasing the possibilities
of renewed armed con�ict. The recent changes in the Arab World introduce
additional tension to Arab�Israeli relations. The con�ict in Syria and the
questions related to Iran’s nuclear programme increase the volatility of the
region. Active involvement is expected of the E� in preventing the escalation
of the con�icts and in resolving them.

In addition to the onward march of democracy the E�’s key strategic interests
served by an effective southern neighbourhood policy include energy security,
controlled immigration, the development of economic cooperation and the
freedom of trade routes. The operations of the European border management
agency FR��TE� on the external borders of the E� and in third countries do
not only support the �nion’s border control, they also bolster third countries’

58


-----

border management structures and national capacities, and the materialisation
of human rights and the rule of law.

Permanent goals of the Eastern Partnership, implemented within the framework
of the European �eighbourhood Policy, include the consolidation of democracy,
human rights and the rule of law as well as economic growth and well�being.

The intensity of the E�’s relations with the countries of Eastern Europe, the
Southern Caucasus and Central Asia varies. �f the partner countries, Moldova,
Georgia and �kraine have made the most progress in coming closer to the
European �nion. The �nion’s strategic goal is to not only strengthen security
and stability in wider Europe but beyond its immediate neighbourhood as well.

The E��Russian relationship is important to both parties. �kraine is presently
seeking a course at the crossroads between the E�’s and Russia’s economic
and political sphere of in�uence. �kraine can play an important role in the
entire domain of the �SCE, provided it manages to stabilise its political system
on the foundation of democracy and the rule of law. Recently this progress has
been somewhat erratic.

The E� strives for the democratisation of the political system of Belarus through
the combination of dialogue, support for the civil society and sanctions. It is
important to make Belarus conform to European standards, to which it has
already committed in the �SCE.

Regional con�icts hold back political stability and democracy in the Southern
Caucasus. This instability also has a spillover effect in Russia’s �orthern
Caucasus.

Conclusion

Finland has consistently supported European integration and the
establishment of an extensive security community in Europe. It is
important for Finland that the �nion retain its status in preserving
stability in Europe and its signi�cance as a security community. The
development of the common security and defence policy supports the
aforementioned goal. E� enlargement and the European �eighbourhood
Policy are also key factors in this development.

###### 2.3 The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)

 NATO’s internal development

�AT�’s Strategic Concept, reformed in ����, de�nes the following three core
tasks for the Alliance: collective defence, international crisis management
and cooperative security through partnership with relevant countries and
international organisations.

While the threat of a conventional attack against �AT� is considered to be
low and the strategic concept highlights that the Alliance does not consider
any country to be its adversary, �AT� prepares for its collective defence
commitment set out in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty.

�AT� defence planning is in constant �ux. The post�Cold War reductions in
heavy weaponry are continuing in Europe with the focus on developing rapidly
deployable, multi�purpose capabilities.

The �S tactical nuclear weapons situated in Europe will be preserved, even
though they are not generally believed to have much military signi�cance, and
the Alliance is ready to negotiate reciprocal reductions with Russia. Progress
on the matter has not been made because as a precondition to negotiations
Russia demands that the �SA withdraw to its national territory the tactical
nuclear weapons. While the �nited States is reducing the footprint of its
permanently stationed troops in Europe, it is increasing its contribution to joint
training and exercises.

�AT� adopted a Phased Adaptive Approach to defend its European allies
against a potential ballistic missile attack by ����. The mainstay of �S
presence in Europe will be the missile�defence architecture which will include
missile defence�capable warships in nearby waters as well as ground�based
radars and missile defence interceptor sites positioned in the territories of its
allies �Turkey, Romania and Poland�. The system, which is primarily intended
to defend against �Iranian� medium�range missiles, is planned to be ready by
���� as per the four�phase plan. It will implement the collective defence task
pursuant to Article 5. Phase �ne reached interim capability in ����.

In addition to international security development, the strategic refocusing
of the �nited States to the Asia�Paci�c raises expectations on the European
�AT� Members as regards the implementation of �AT�’s tasks. The goal
of the �nited States is to increase the relative share of Europeans in �AT��
led operations. Such development only increases the need to improve the

60


-----

relationship between �AT� and the E� in crisis management and capabilities.
�AT�’s civil emergency preparedness activities bolster national preparedness
and harmonise resources in view of potential crises.

In the prevailing security environment, alongside crisis management, �AT�
focuses on cyber security, the threat arising from the proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction and ballistic missiles, and energy security and counter�
terrorist action.

###### Reform of NATO’s partnership policy

The importance of partner countries in �AT� activities has grown. �AT� allies
and partners form a wide�ranging security cooperation network. The partner
countries signi�cantly contribute to crisis management and other security
collaboration.

The reform of �AT� Partnership policy, adopted in the Berlin ���� meeting
of ministers of foreign affairs, put all �� partner countries on equal footing
and ended the special status of the countries participating in �AT�’s PfP
programme. �AT� has improved the in�uence of its partner countries and is
aiming to increase the options of engaging in political dialogue with them in
different con�gurations. At the same time the fundamental distinction between
membership and partnership will prevail, in other words, only �AT� Member
States will participate in collective defence and decision�making.

The �nited States hopes that �AT�’s partnership and cooperation develops
in a manner through which it can accrue more bene�ts from burden�sharing.
While �AT� partnership arrangements are tailored to �t the capabilities and
readiness of its partner countries, �AT� expects ever�increasing initiative from
its partner countries as regards their degree of collaboration. Finland and
Sweden are respected as partner countries that have progressed the most in
interoperability and have actively participated in operations.

�AT� is increasingly shifting its attention beyond the Euro�Atlantic area,
and is focusing on developing global partnerships. The �nited States has
underscored the role of �AT� as the nucleus of global security and stability.
�AT� partnership is one way to highlight interdependence and common
responsibility with countries such as Australia, �ew �ealand, �apan and South
�orea. �AT� is also interested in future dialogue with increasingly in�uential
states like China, India and Brazil. This entails that �AT� is not only perceived
as an enforcer of the speci�c interests of western industrialised countries.

61


-----

###### NATO and Russia

�AT�’s �� Member States and Russia extensively cooperate in the �AT��Russia
Council which deals with military�to�military cooperation, the �ght against
terrorism and civil emergency planning. �AT� Member States and Russia have
declared at the level of heads of state that, rather than posing a threat to each
other, they are partners to one another. The �AT��Russia relationship mirrors
the changes in the �S�Russian relationships.

In addition to �AT� enlargement the key disagreement involves missile
defence, which, on the other hand, could also offer the possibility for a new
type of cooperation.

Conclusion

Finland has participated in �AT� Partnership since its inception. From
the Finnish standpoint the reform of �AT�’s partnership policy is a
positive development. The consistent opening of activities to all partner
countries has also presented some challenges to Finland. Finland aims
to further develop �AT� cooperation in a mutually bene�cial way.

**NATO missile defence system**

According to the decisions of the Lisbon Summit (2010) NATO would create a strategic
Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) capability to protect European populations, territory and
forces. This capability supports the implementation of the collective defence task.

The strategic missile defence capability will be created by expanding the theatre-level tactical
missile defence system (Active Layered Theatre Ballistic Missile Defence, ALTBMD), which
protects troops in operations. The components of the US national missile defence system to
be positioned in Europe (Poland, Romania, Turkey and Spain) represent the fulcrum of the
strategic missile defence capability.

In the Chicago Summit (2012) it was declared that the NATO missile defence system has
reached interim capability. This phase was considered to have been achieved when US national
missile defence systems positioned in Europe had reached initial operational capability under
NATO command and control. The goal is that the system will reach full operational capability
by the end of this decade.

At the Lisbon Summit NATO agreed to pursue cooperation with Russia on strategic missile
defence. However, progress in the fledgling NATO-Russian missile defence cooperation
has been slow. Whereas Russia’s point of departure entails a joint system and a ‘sectoral’
approach to the defence of Europe, NATO is aiming for cooperation between two separate
systems, and has proposed the creation of a joint situation picture with Russia. Through
tangible cooperation NATO is trying to demonstrate that the system is not intended to be
used against Russia.

The Lisbon Summit also raised the possibility of cooperation with partners.

62


-----

###### 2.4 The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe  and the Council of Europe

The vision for a free, democratic, united and indivisible Europe advanced in
the post�Cold War era. However, the progress then slowed to a halt in the ��st
Century. The concept of wide, cooperative, equal and indivisible security is
increasingly topical in strengthening stability and security in Europe.

At the �SCE’s Astana Summit Meeting in ���� the participating countries
recommitted themselves to the vision of a Euro�Atlantic and Eurasian security
community stretching from Vancouver to Vladivostok. In recent years the
�SCE has particularly focused on election observation missions, democracy
and con�ict prevention.

In order to proceed with the uni�cation process in the wider Euro�Atlantic and
Eurasian area, which includes the Caucasus and Central Asia, it is imperative
to resolve protracted political con�icts, reform arms control regimes and
strengthen the commitment to common norms in practice. Russia plays a
pivotal role with regard to any progress in these questions.

Mistrust between the Member States resonates in the debate on reforming
the �SCE. Russia believes that the �SCE’s practical activities one�sidedly
focus on achieving political change in countries that relate to its security
interests. Election monitoring is a persistent point of contention. The impasse
in the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe �CFE� Treaty negotiations creates
distrust. Even though the military equilibrium, as a whole, is not threatened in
the area of the �SCE, military transparency as well as con�dence and security�
building measures are needed in regional and local con�icts. The signi�cance
of the �SCE must also be evaluated against the backdrop of Russia having
begun to push for Eurasian integration, in which it has a leading role.

The geopolitical standing of Central Asian countries hinges on their location
and natural resources. It is important to keep them within the sphere of �SCE
commitments and assistance. In �ovember ���� Mongolia was accepted as a
new Member State of the �SCE. This opens up entirely new vistas for �SCE
activities in Asia.

The impact of the Middle East and Afghanistan on the security of wider Europe
arises from geographical proximity as well as their strategic importance as
zones of con�ict. The spillover effects into the area of the �SCE can include
Islamist extremism, the narcotics traf�cking and the proliferation of WMDs.
The stabilisation of Afghanistan, following the end of ISAF operation in ����,

63


-----

will speci�cally impact the security of Central Asia and Russia. It will continue
to be an important target for international security cooperation.

In addition to the �SCE the Council of Europe strengthens the shared value
base. The Council of Europe plays a central role in consolidating democracy,
human rights and the rule of law in Europe. The Council plays an important
role in developing treaty regimes and it also continues to focus on promoting
tolerance and advancing the rights of minorities.

Despite the states’ commitments and the long�standing efforts of the �SCE,
the Council of Europe, other organisations and increasingly stronger civil
societies, the zone of stable democracies has not expanded in recent years.

Conclusion

The goal of reinforcing common values through the �SCE and the
Council of Europe advances the creation of a security community in
Europe.

#### 3 Security development in Finland’s neighbourhood

###### 3.1 Cooperation in strengthening comprehensive security

 Neighbouring areas

The security situation is good in Finland’s neighbourhood. The consolidation of
cooperation in the Baltic Sea area and in the north, based on mutual interests,
strengthens stability and promotes comprehensive security in Finland’s
neighbourhood. Regional cooperation in �orthern Europe is an important
addition to the development in Europe and beyond.

Long�standing cooperation in Finland’s neighbourhood covers common
problems such as environmental threats, nuclear safety, major accidents and
disasters, cross�border organised crime, illicit immigration, cyber threats and
issues related to public health.

Established cooperation in the Baltic Sea region, especially within the framework
of the Council of the Baltic Sea States �CBSS�, bene�ts the environment, the
economy, transport, research and other �elds of society. States around the
Baltic Rim share the bene�ts of keeping the transit route open and accident�
free as well as clean and viable. This supports stability in the region. The
�ord Stream Pipeline increases the signi�cance of the Baltic Sea in economic

64


-----

interaction in which Russia and the European �nion depend on each other.
The volume of oil transports in the Baltic Sea will grow sharply, which also
increases the risks of accidents and environmental disasters in shipping.

The �orthern Dimension and the E� Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region fuse
the �nion’s collective prestige and resources into cooperation which has
achieved good results, especially in the �eld of the environment. The �orthern
Dimension is a policy shared by the E�, Russia, �orway and Iceland. Concrete
cooperation takes place within the framework of the Dimension to alleviate
problems in areas such as wastewater management, nuclear safety, transport
and infectious diseases. Russia’s participation in institutionalised regional
cooperation is important, and new venues of cooperation are presently being
sought. The E� Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region aims to improve cooperation
between the actors in the area, and to better utilise the E��funded programmes
intended to improve the maritime environment, economic development, appeal
and security of the Baltic Sea area.

page 116

###### The Arctic region

The consequences of climate change to the Arctic environment are profound.
It is estimated that temperatures will increase at about twice the global rate in
the Arctic region. As a result of this the vegetation zones in the Arctic will shift,
the diversity and distribution of fauna will change, the polar ice cap as a whole
will continue to shrink and the permafrost will melt in places. Climate change
will increase the commercial utilisation of the northern sea routes ��ortheast
Passage, �orthwest Passage� in the coming decades.

There is great interest in exploiting the abundant natural resources of the
Arctic region. The management of environmental issues requires improved
technologies, better infrastructure and maritime safety as well as more
sophisticated navigation systems. It also requires a balanced approach in the
tolerance of the environment to Arctic business activities and tapping into
international cooperation.

The development of transport routes as well as communications and logistics
networks in the �orthern Arctic �cean is paramount to the economy of the
northern regions. The oil and gas reserves are almost exclusively located on
the continental shelves or in the economic zones of Arctic �cean rim states
and so they control the manner by which the resources will be brought online.

65


-----

There are several unresolved questions pertaining to the rights of the coastal
states of the region and these have to be resolved in accordance with
international law. The present international treaty regime, in particular the
�nited �ations Convention on the Law of the Sea ���CL�S�, provides a basis
for the handling of Arctic questions.

In ����, after �� years of negotiations �orway and Russia signed a historically
important treaty on maritime delimitation and cooperation in the Barents
Sea and the Arctic �cean. There are still unresolved maritime delimitation
issues between Denmark�Greenland, Canada and the �nited States. In the
coming years Russia, Canada and Denmark will make their submissions to the
Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf regarding the extension
of their continental shelves. As regards the northern sea areas, thus far the
Commission has only adopted the �nal recommendations on the outer limits of
�orway’s continental shelf. The �nited States has yet to ratify the Convention.

The Arctic �cean rim states have agreed that they will attempt to resolve
delimitation questions on the basis of international law and scienti�c data. The
ongoing assessments and their results will echo on the states’ views on Arctic
cooperation.

In their national Arctic strategies Russia and Canada emphasise their
sovereignty in their Arctic regions. The rim states are modernising their
maritime surveillance and military equipment suited to the Polar regions, and
the number of exercises in the vicinity of the region is on the rise. Russia does
not want �AT� or China to increase their presence in the Arctic region.

When it comes to security policy the Arctic region is stable, and a military con�ict
in the area is considered to be unlikely. �onetheless, security developments
in the region must be monitored. A goal shared by all Arctic �cean rim states
and the other Member States of the Arctic Council is to preserve and promote
peaceful cooperation in the Arctic region.

Conclusions

Finland maintains close and wide�ranging relationships in its
neighbourhood, and actively participates in establishing and developing
cooperative structures in the area. Comprehensive cooperation in these
structures promotes stability in Finland’s neighbourhood.

When it comes to Arctic questions Finland supports the efforts of
international and regional organisations. The Arctic Council, the Barents
Euro�Arctic Council and the International Maritime �rganisation �IM��
play important roles in Arctic questions. The �nited �ations Convention

66


-----

on the Law of the Sea lays a comprehensive foundation for the terms
of using and protecting the world’s seas. The Arctic Council implements
collaborative programmes in the �eld of sustainable development.

Finland has actively developed the cooperative structures in the area of
the Baltic Sea, such as the Council of the Baltic Sea States �CBSS� and
by utilising the E� Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region.

**The Arctic Council, the Barents Euro-Arctic Council and the Council**
**of the Baltic Sea States**

All three councils are intergovernmental cooperative fora which operate in their respective
geographic areas. The Arctic Council was founded in 1996 and its Member States include
the eight Arctic states and representatives of indigenous peoples. It comprehensively covers
issues related to the region such as the environment, navigation, research and treaty regimes.
The Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, Poland, France and Germany have observer
status in the Council.

The purpose of the Barents Euro-Arctic Council is to promote stability, sustainable
development and security in the Barents area, the most populated area in the Arctic region.
The Council was founded in 1993 and, in addition to its seven permanent members, observer
states include the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Italy, Canada, Poland, France, Germany
and the United States.

The Council of the Baltic Sea States was established in 1992 to promote democracy and
economic development in the Baltic Sea Region. In addition to the Members of the Council
there are observer states (the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy, Slovakia, France,
Romania, Ukraine, Belarus and the United States).

###### 3.2 The security and defence policy of Nordic countries, and security  cooperation

The �ordic countries are forerunners in the provision of security. In addition,
there is broad support for �ordic cooperation among Finns. The �ordic
countries make up a strong value community and an area of close interaction.
There is a long tradition of active, practical cooperation between the civilian
authorities. The �eld of defence is the newest addition to this cooperation
and is viewed favourably by the citizens. The development of �ordic defence
cooperation ���RDEFC�� was launched in ���� by the joint initiative of the
chiefs of defence of Finland, �orway and Sweden. In ���� the report of
Thorvald Stoltenberg, the former foreign minister of �orway, gave it signi�cant
impetus as regards cooperation in �ordic foreign and security policy.

**The proposals of the Stoltenberg report (2009) to increase Nordic cooperation**

1.  Nordic stabilisation Task Force. A Nordic stabilisation task force should be established
that can be deployed to states affected by major internal unrest or other critical situations
where international assistance is desirable.

2.  Nordic cooperation on surveillance of Icelandic airspace. The Nordic countries
should take on part of the responsibility for air surveillance and air patrolling over Iceland.
The Nordic cooperation could be developed in three phases.

3.  Nordic maritime monitoring system. A Nordic system should be established for
monitoring and early warning in the Nordic sea areas. The system should in principle
be civilian and be designed for tasks such as monitoring the marine environment and
pollution and monitoring of civilian traffic.

4.  Maritime response force. Once a Nordic maritime monitoring system is in place, a
Nordic maritime response force should be established. One of its main responsibilities
should be search and rescue.

5.  Satellite system for surveillance and communications. By 2020, a Nordic polar orbit
satellite system should be established in connection with the development of a Nordic
maritime monitoring system.

6.  Nordic cooperation on Arctic issues. The Nordic countries, which are all members of
the Arctic Council, should develop cooperation on Arctic issues focusing on more practical
matters. The environment, climate change, maritime safety and search and rescue services
are appropriate areas for such cooperation.

7.  Nordic resource network to protect against cyber attacks. A Nordic resource
network should be established to defend the Nordic countries against cyber attacks.

8.  Disaster response unit. A Nordic disaster response unit should be established for dealing
with large-scale disasters and accidents in the Nordic region and in other countries. The
unit’s main task would be to coordinate Nordic efforts as needed.

68


-----

It is natural for the �ordic countries to cooperate in the �eld of foreign and
security policy in the spirit of solidarity. Regarding the interested parties the
���� �ordic declaration on solidarity involves potential risks, such as natural
and man�made disasters, cyber and terrorist attacks. Should a �ordic country
be affected, the others will, upon request from that country, assist with relevant
means. The intensi�ed �ordic cooperation will be undertaken fully in line with
each country’s security and defence policy and complement existing European
and Euro�Atlantic cooperation.

Sweden promotes more exhaustive security commitments. For its part, the
Swedish government declared that Sweden will not remain passive should
another E� Member State or �ordic country be struck by disaster or attack.
By the same token, Sweden expects that the E� and the �ordic countries do
the same if a disaster or attack were to befall Sweden. Sweden must have the
capability to provide and receive military assistance.

The �ordic countries’ geographical proximity, their shared security environment
and the similar tasks, goals and operating cultures of their defence forces,
facilitate and foster wide�ranging defence cooperation and common solutions
among the �ordic countries. Finland is preparing to assume the presidency of
��RDEFC� in ����.

69


-----

�ordic cooperation strives to achieve added operational, economic and
technical value for defence. This will enable closer cooperation between the
�ordic defence forces as well as the common development of pooled and
shared national military capabilities. Capabilities development between the
�ordic countries also complements the capabilities cooperation done under
the auspices of �AT� and the E�.

**Nordic Defence Cooperation, NORDEFCO**

Whilst Nordic cooperation has significantly intensified in recent years, it already has a long
tradition. For example, crisis management cooperation has been implemented since the
1960s and defence materiel cooperation since 1994. In 2009 a decision was taken to combine
the cooperation under the single umbrella of Nordic Defence Cooperation, NORDEFCO.

NORDEFCO is a cooperative structure, comprising a flexible combination of experts and
decision-makers from the political and military levels of the Nordic defence establishments.
The cooperation strives for cost-effectiveness. Simultaneously, it aims to bring operational,
economic, technical and industrial added value as well as interoperability which would
facilitate even better cooperation between the Nordic defence forces in the future. The
cooperation complements the nations’ national defence solutions as well as bilateral, EU
and NATO cooperation. At present the daily cooperation covers the following areas: defence
policy, strategic development, capabilities, human resources and education, training and
exercises and operations.

The Nordic countries have already greatly profited from cooperation. Many tangible results
have been achieved in logistics as well as training and exercises, to name but a few. The
practical examples also include crisis management cooperation, combining strategic
transports and logistics in the operation in Afghanistan, air cross-border air exercises, the
army’s ground-based air defence and gunnery practice exercises, cooperation on naval
countermeasures and joint exercises, the creation of a Nordic Center for Gender and the
support to East African crisis management capability.

The strongest points of Nordic defence cooperation include the flexible format and that the
countries can select in which cooperative projects they want to participate. More often than
not cooperation occurs between two or three Nordic countries. At the same time a part of the
cooperation is implemented within the framework of the EU or NATO. A good example of this
is the so-called NORDIC+ crisis management cooperation in the NATO-led Operation ISAF in
Afghanistan, and the cooperation in the European Union’s Nordic battle group.

The countries in the Baltic Sea area and in the Arctic Council are interested
in security policy cooperation with the �ordic countries. The �nited States is
continuing the security dialogue related, especially, to the environs of �orthern
Europe with the �ordic countries and Baltic states in the Enhanced Partnership
in �orthern Europe �e�PI�E� format. The Baltic states have been invited to
participate in some ��RDEFC� joint projects.

70


-----

The �ordic countries participate in exercises with Russia in maritime rescue
and oil recovery, among other things.

Sweden is an in�uential international actor. It has a solid standing in the ��
and the E�. In addition, it has sound bilateral relations and it is also the key
player in �ordic cooperation. Whereas Sweden is not planning to apply for
�AT� membership, it has traditionally engaged in close cooperation within the
framework of �AT� partnership.

Sweden and Finland have a close security policy relationship. There is an
understanding that they consult each other on security policy questions
and evaluate the signi�cance of each other’s policy positions from their own
standpoint.

Sweden actively participates and in�uences security policy and international
crisis management. Sweden has made a valuable contribution to �AT�
operations in Afghanistan and �osovo, and it had an important role in the ���
mandated, �AT��led operation in Libya.

Sweden is politically prepared to increase its own role, and that of the
�ordic countries, in the preservation of regional security: it is developing the
appropriate capabilities for this. Sweden’s security policy guidelines emphasise
both solidarity and collective security generated in concert with other countries
and international organisations. The policy is based on the Swedish view that
military con�icts or other threats in its neighbourhood would not impact one
country alone.

In line with its security policy Sweden will follow through with its landmark
decision of imposing numerical cuts to its defence forces while launching
qualitative improvements aimed at improving their deployability. By ���� the
total wartime strength of Sweden will decrease to 5� ��� troops, �� ��� of
which will belong to the Home Guard. Apart from the Home Guard all other
troops can be deployed to international tasks. Sweden’s defence reform has
been positively regarded by �AT�.

By ����, following its reform, Sweden aims to achieve the target of maintaining
� ��� troops in constant readiness for national or international tasks. This
number includes the troops that are already deployed to operations, the
national high�readiness troops and those in the E�’s Battle Group standby
rotation.

71


-----

�orway and Denmark base their security on �AT� membership. Support for
E� accession has not been on the rise in �orway. By virtue of its caveat at
the level of the Treaty on European �nion Denmark opted out of the E�’s
military activities. However, it actively participates in the E�’s civilian crisis
management operations.

�orway and Denmark have staunchly contributed to �AT��led crisis
management, especially in Afghanistan and, in the past, in Libya, and to
�AT�’s defence planning. While the troop strengths of their defence forces
have been cut, their capabilities and deployability have been improved from
the perspective of crisis management participation.

Iceland is a �AT� Member State and its pre�accession process with the E� is
presently ongoing. Iceland has signed a bilateral defence agreement with the
�nited States. The country has no armed forces of its own, nor are there any
permanently stationed foreign troops on its territory. Icelandic air surveillance
is carried out by �AT� with periodic rotations in which �orway and Denmark
have also participated. In reference to the proposal of the Stoltenberg report,
Iceland has also expressed the wish that Finland and Sweden participate in the
air surveillance as a �ordic project.

Conclusions

The intensifying �ordic foreign, security and defence policy cooperation
supports the strengthening of the role of the �ordic countries in the
international arena, promotes stability in �orthern Europe as well as
in the Baltic Sea area and northern regions, and provides a practical
approach to handling wide�ranging security questions. Closer �ordic
cooperation advances and expands Finland’s options in in�uencing its
neighbourhood.

�ordic defence cooperation improves cost�effectiveness and
interoperability. Cooperation in international crisis management
operations is already time�honoured. ��RDEFC� provides the framework
for the intensi�cation of defence cooperation.

2013 on the budget proposal (17 September 2012).

###### 3.3 The security and defence policy of the Baltic states


The security policies of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are based on �AT�
membership. Simultaneously, they underscore their relationships with the
�nited States. In addition, E� membership carries security policy signi�cance
to the Baltic states.

The Baltic states contribute to �AT� activities and actively participate
in international crisis management, in �AT� and the E� alike. Defence
development within �AT� and the participation of the �nited States in the
security of its European allies are questions of vital importance for the Baltic
states. They have required that �AT� update the defence plan for the region
which, presumably, has been done.


Baltic air policing is an established system in �AT�. It is important for the
Baltic states that their air policing is carried out as a �AT� core task, i.e. by
�AT� Member States alone.

73


-----

Conclusions

The increasing participation of the Baltic states in �ordic and Baltic Sea
region cooperation is a positive development.

The Baltic states are close partners to Finland in deepening security and
defence policy dialogue as well.

###### 3.4 Russia’s security and defence policy in its neighbouring areas

Russia’s internal stability, its economic development and its military
modernisation programme are factors which fundamentally impact Finland’s
security environment. Apart from oil and natural gas production the bulk of
Russia’s population as well as most of its infrastructure and the facilities for
its economic activity are located in its northwestern and western regions. The
signi�cance of the Baltic Sea region is of key importance to Russia’s foreign
trade and energy policy. The area is strategically vital to the capacity of the
nation.

The positioning, composition and exercises of the Russian armed forces in
the Western Military District focus on protecting the strategically important
greater St Petersburg area and the �ola Peninsula. The goal is to improve
the capabilities of the troops in the northwest by rationalising functions and
command structures, replacing obsolete defence materiel and by improving
the conditions of the troops. �ey goals include the efforts to achieve high
readiness, improved power projection capabilities and a capacity that can
make an impact in Russia’s neighbouring areas.

Russia views �AT� enlargement as a political and military problem. According
to the Russian view, the enlargement weakens its foreign policy goal of
achieving a multipolar world order and jeopardises its sphere of interest.
Russia has been unreceptive towards its neighbours’ approaches towards
�AT�, objecting speci�cally to the �AT� membership aspirations of Georgia
and the past ambitions of �kraine.

Russia is developing the Arctic military capacities of all of its military services.
The intention is to better equip the Army for the northern environment. �aval
supply bases will be built along the northern waterway and air bases in the
Barents Sea area such as �ovaya �emlya will be reopened and modernised
for the air force. The �ola Peninsula continues to remain highly important in
Russian military thinking. Russia also intends to improve its air defences of
the �ola Peninsula and St Petersburg as well as �aliningrad by deploying the
most modern and capable ground�based air defence missile systems there.

74


-----

Russia’s armed forces are developing their strike capability, among other
things, through the Army’s new ballistic missile systems, and by procuring new
�ghter�bombers for the air force.

The signi�cance of the Arctic region is not only economically important to Russia.
It also has wider security policy signi�cance. The opening of the �ortheast
Passage increases Russia’s territorial surveillance tasks and responsibilities
over maritime safety. The increasing strategic signi�cance of the region will
also re�ect on Russia’s military policy decisions.

Russia considers the Arctic region to be its sphere of interest. According to
Russia, only Arctic �cean rim states have a legitimate right to participate in
decision�making related to the region. Its central goal is to keep control of
the use of raw materials in the hands of the states of the region. Then again,
Russia needs to cooperate with foreign businesses in bringing its raw material
reserves online.

Conclusion

Russia’s foreign policy, its societal development and the transformation of
its armed forces impact Finland’s neighbourhood. Positive developments
in �AT��Russia relations promote stability in the region.

### SECURITY AND DEFENCE POLICY

#### 4 Security policy

###### 4.1 Central premises and key policies

 Central premises

The foreign, security and defence policy of Finland safeguards the independence,
territorial integrity and common values of society. Maintaining the security
and prosperity of the nation and the undisturbed functioning of society are
at the core of these policies. Based on a concept of comprehensive security
that is in�uenced by changing factors, the use of multiple instruments in the
implementation of these policies is called for.

Finland’s security policy actively furthers security as well as anticipates
and responds to security threats. Finland must analyse the global security
environment, anticipate the developments therein and ensure that the selected
security policy guidelines promote international collaboration and cooperative
security in the most optimal way as well as promote Finland’s international
status, values, interests and security.

Finland’s security and defence policy is characterised by continuity, transparency
and a strong commitment to European and international collaboration. These
are epitomised by active participation in the development of the E�’s common
security and defence policy, �AT� partnership, �ordic cooperation and
international crisis management.

It is important to strengthen the E�’s cohesion and capacity. From the
standpoint of Finland’s interests it is vital to strengthen the �nion’s common
values, societal well�being, economic competitiveness, international appeal
and global in�uence. An internationally robust, united and capable �nion
also serves Finland’s interests. Membership of the E� is a fundamental
security policy choice for Finland. The �nion’s wide�ranging activities increase
European integration between Member States and have a positive impact on
their international and security policy roles. They also promote the well�being
and security of citizens and sustain the viability of society. Finland, being an
active and involved Member State, is committed to the political union, whose
Member States share a sense of unity and the will to collaborate on wide�
ranging issues.

76


-----

The importance of the European �nion to the security of Finland is profound
and multifaceted. It widely impacts Finland’s security environment at global
and European levels as well as in Finland’s environs. The �nion is a key actor
in issues related to the functioning of society, internal security and in tackling
border management challenges.

Finland’s security is built on good bilateral relations, active in�uencing in the
European �nion as well as wide�ranging cooperation with other states and
international actors. Finland aims to consolidate international stability, security,
peace and justice as well as sustainable development, and to advance the
rule of law, democracy and human rights. Finland participates in international
burden�sharing, in the development of global governance and takes an active
part in efforts to �nd solutions to international problems. Finland aims to
strengthen the role of the ��.

Security policy will take into account the importance of cross�border threats as
well as international cooperation in combating them. In addition, the signi�cance
of the internal state of societies is highlighted as part of comprehensive
security. Security can also be bolstered by promoting societal well�being and
by preventing tension, social exclusion and segregation.

While the probability of armed aggression against Finland is low and, speci�cally,
of one aiming to seize territory, it cannot be categorically excluded. A security
threat extending to Finland can emerge within the context of a wider regional
or European con�ict.

Finland will continue to see to its own defence capability. The defence solution
is built on a territorial defence system covering the entire area of the country.
General conscription will remain one of its cornerstones. The goal is to prevent
security threats and to prepare for them in accordance with the principle of
comprehensive security. The options provided by multinational cooperation will
be utilised in maintaining and developing the defence capability.

The Province of Åland Islands has a recognised status under international
law. �pholding the special status of the province does not prevent Finland
from intensifying defence cooperation within the European �nion and in
international organisations.

###### Key policies

Finland advances and strengthens its bilateral relations with other countries.
Along with the traditionally signi�cant relations with the �ordic countries, other

77


-----

Member States of the European �nion, the �nited States and Russia, Finland
intensi�es its relationships with the emerging countries.

The aim is to develop the European �nion so as to improve its external role,
security and competitiveness. The goal is to strengthen the structures and
activities which advance the E�’s global role as a value�based actor that
coherently taps into a wide range of instruments.

Finland strives for the extensive development of the E�’s external relations by
emphasising strategic partnerships with key global actors and the importance
of the European neighbourhood to Europe’s prosperity and security. In
accordance with the options provided by the Lisbon Treaty, Finland increasingly
promotes both a more effective common foreign and security policy �CFSP�
and a common security and defence policy �CSDP�.

Finland is not a member of a military alliance, but cooperates with the �orth
Atlantic Treaty �rganisation and maintains the option of applying for �AT�
membership. Finland is not preparing to apply for �AT� membership during
the present Government’s term of of�ce. Finland will evaluate its possible �AT�
membership on the grounds of its own national security and defence policy
interests. Finland promotes cooperation between the European �nion and
�AT�, recognising �AT�’s importance as the key forum of European security
policy. Defence development will see to it that no practical impediments are
created for possible military alignment.

�ordic foreign, security and defence policy cooperation will be intensi�ed.
Deepening collaboration facilitates the maintenance and development of military
capabilities. Furthermore, this cooperation improves interoperability, which
facilitates more effective cooperation in training and exercises, surveillance
missions, procurement projects and crisis management operations.

The ��, being a universal global organisation, has a central role in strengthening
multilateral cooperation – which is Finland’s goal as well – and in creating
an international order based on international law. Finland supports con�ict
prevention, crisis management, mediation and peacebuilding within the
multilateral system, the E�,international organisations, and bilaterally.

78


-----

###### 4.2 Finland as a Member State of the EU, and cooperation with NATO

 Supporting the European Union’s role in strengthening security

A credible, effective and comprehensive E� common foreign and security
policy serves Finland’s interests. From the Finnish viewpoint the E� should
strengthen the strategic approach of the CFSP and, if possible, outline a new
foreign and security policy strategy which draws the necessary conclusions
from the changing operating environment. A common vision of the E� for the
key priorities and their order, as well as the consistent use of resources and
instruments will also intensify the impact of the �nion’s external policy in its
entirety.

Finland is committed to the development of the common security and defence
policy. The possibilities for collaboration between like�minded countries must
be utilised in achieving this goal. It is important for Finland that the E�
comprehensively develop its crisis management activities. The long�term goal
involves the creation of the E�’s permanent planning and conduct capability
for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of crisis management.

Any new political division regarding the development of the CSDP within the
E� must be avoided. All Member States should participate in its development.
If, however, this is not feasible Finland is prepared to support work in smaller
groups. Permanent structural cooperation provides an option for developing
military capabilities within smaller groups.

The European �nion’s area of freedom, security and justice should be further
enhanced. This applies to the area in which internal and external security
questions are intertwined. Furthermore, the �nion itself, too, should develop
the means of consolidating the fundamental rights and the rule of law in its
Member States.

Finland actively promotes further E� enlargement. All European countries
that meet the membership criteria should have the possibility to to accede to
the �nion. The accession process of Turkey and its intensifying partnership
with the E�, especially as Turkey’s regional and global role is continuously
growing, also strengthen Europe’s security environment. Finland promotes
the European �eighbourhood Policy and the Eastern Partnership in order to
support reforms in its eastern and southern neighbourhood, and to stabilise
the countries therein.

79


-----

###### Cooperation with NATO

�AT�’s intensifying cooperation with the E�, the ��, the �SCE and other
international and regional organisations is a positive development from the
Finnish viewpoint. �AT� continues to be the key European security policy
actor. The role of �AT� and the commitment of the �nited States to Europe
are vital aspects in maintaining the security of the continent.

Wide�ranging cooperation with �AT� will continue. In addition to the defence
sector, several administrative branches cooperate with �AT� in �elds such as
civil emergency planning and contingency planning.

Finland actively participates in the development of �AT�’s partnership policy.
Finland supports the development of cooperation within the framework of
�exible, thematic structures. Crisis management and capabilities cooperation
are the crux of Finland’s partnership cooperation. Finland, at its own discretion,
continues to participate in �AT��led crisis management operations. Finland
considers it important that operational partners be allowed to participate in the
planning and preparation phases of new operations.

Finland continues to comprehensively tap into the instruments provided
by �AT� in developing the capabilities of the Finnish Defence Forces. By
participating in �AT�’s Planning and Review Process �PARP� and the �perational
Capabilities Concept ��CC�, and by developing its capacity to participate in the
activities supplementing the �AT� Response Force ��RF�, Finland develops
interoperability and improves its capacity to participate in international crisis
management, irrespective of whether the operation is led by �AT�, the E� or
the ��. The development of military interoperability also improves Finland’s
technical preparedness to receive international assistance in a crisis.

###### 4.3 Other key actors

Finland engages in extensive bilateral cooperation with the �nited States
and values the continued commitment of the �nited States in multilateral
cooperation.

Finland also aims to advance the cooperation between the E� and the �SA so
that the partnership improves the global security environment and advances
the solution of international problems. It is important for Finland that Europe
remain an interesting cooperation area for the �SA, and that the �nited States
support security, stability and well�being in the region.

80


-----

Finland develops its relationship with Russia through close interaction
and cooperation at the political level, between the authorities, through the
economy and at the level of citizens. Furthermore, Finland encourages Russia
to participate in regional cooperation in its neighbourhood.

It is Finland’s goal that Russia strongly commit to international cooperation
and multilateral treaty regimes and global burden�sharing. Finland actively
promotes a broad�based development of the E��Russia relationship. E��
Russian cooperation should also be developed in the �eld of foreign and
security policy.

Finland also develops its relationships with the emerging states and supports the
development of the E�’s strategic partnerships. Finland intensi�es its political
and economic relationship with China in areas that are of particular interest
to Finland and essential to the development of China, such as environmental
technology and renewables, and topics related to good governance and the
rule of law.

Finland continues to invest in versatile bilateral relations with developing
countries. Development policy is a key instrument in this cooperation. Trade
relations, too, will be broadly developed.

###### 4.4 The promotion of global security

 Supporting the multilateral system

Finland advocates increasingly robust global governance structures and in
particular the development of the capacity of the �� system. The �� and its
Security Council have a central role in legitimising universally binding solutions.
The Security Council should be expanded so as to make it more representative.
It should also be made more ef�cient by increasing transparency, among other
things.

The international economic crisis must be resolved and international economic
interaction must be reformed in a manner that strengthens sustainable
development, fair global governance and transparent economic interaction.
Finland particularly in�uences the international economy within the E� and
through the �ordic community. Finland aims to internationally highlight the
model of the �ordic welfare state which has prevailed and demonstrated its
effectiveness and resilience in the global transition.

81


-----

Finland promotes the strengthening of international law and, especially the
work of the International Criminal Court �ICC� and other international war
crimes tribunals in their efforts to reduce impunity. Finland aims to advocate
the application of the international Responsibility to Protect �RtoP� principle.

Finland operates within the framework of the �SCE to sustain and strengthen
its principles and standards, and to comprehensively develop the organisation.
The role of the �SCE as the proponent for wider European security development
and uni�cation should be preserved. Finland promotes the strengthening and
promotion of the standards and mechanisms developed by the Council of
Europe, and supports the focusing of the activities of the Council of Europe on
the promotion of human rights, the rule of law and democracy.

###### Using a wide range of instruments

Finland supports con�ict prevention and management as well as peacebuilding
through the means of foreign, trade and development policies, and by
participating in the development of civilian and military crisis management,
mediation, humanitarian assistance, arms control and the promotion of human
rights.

Finland in�uences the development of international mediation within the
framework of the ��. Finland and Turkey have jointly established the Group
of Friends of Mediation. Finland is actively involved in the development of
the E�’s mediation capacity and bilaterally supports the strengthening of the
mediation capacities of regional organisations, such as the African �nion. The
role of women in peace processes is strengthened and mediation resources are
improved in Finland and in the �ordic context.

�nder Government guidelines development cooperation funds can be increased
to advance comprehensive security in areas where Finland supports mediation,
peacekeeping and crisis management activities. Suf�cient resources will be
earmarked for this purpose.

Tasks related to mediation, security sector reform and the rule of law often
require rapid reaction and the �exible use of resources. In view of this the
Ministry for Foreign Affairs has already introduced a simpli�ed and expedited
�nancing process for mediation. Should there be a need to establish new
mechanisms in addition to the existing ones, the possibilities of implementing
them will be studied. Functions excluded by the criteria for of�cial development
assistance will not be �nanced through development cooperation funds.

82


-----

International sanctions are an important element of the comprehensive
approach in con�ict prevention and management. Finland actively participates
in the development of the international sanctions regime by emphasising the
role of the �� Security Council as the originator of decisions that are binding to
all �� Member States. Sanctions also comprise a key feature in the E�’s range
of instruments. The wider the international support, the more effective the
sanction regimes. Finland regards it important that sanctions be as accurately
targeted as possible, and that the negative impacts to those not concerned be
minimised and that the targets of sanctions retain the due protection of law.

###### Participation in international crisis management

Finland continues to participate in crisis management tasks in order to support
security, stability and con�ict solution, and to strengthen Finland’s security,
international standing and defence capability. Military crisis management
develops the skills and capabilities needed in defending Finland and in crises
affecting us. Finland aims to improve the effectiveness of its crisis management
activities and its comprehensive participation in demanding international crisis
management activities in a manner that takes into account Finland’s strengths.
The objective is to have Finns in leading positions of crisis management
operations.

Military and civilian crisis management can be used in a complementary manner,
tailored to the speci�c needs of each crisis area and international mission.
Military and civilian crisis management as well as development cooperation and
humanitarian assistance should be coordinated to achieve the best possible
and sustainable combined effects. Whereas the roles and responsibilities of
military and civilian crisis management as well as development cooperation and
humanitarian assistance are distinct, they can mutually reinforce each other.
The �� principles of independence, impartiality and humanity are followed
when it comes to the implementation of humanitarian assistance.

Supporting a crisis area’s own security structures and the rule of law, and
training its security sector, strengthens the basic structures of society. Alongside
operational participation, increasing attention is given to the export of crisis
management training expertise. The goal is to boost the developing countries’
local crisis management capacities, especially in Africa.

Crisis management will also take into account cross�cutting themes such as the
promotion of human rights, gender equality, democracy and the rule of law as
well as cultural and religious dimensions. The status of women and girls as well

83


-----

as their participation in issues related to peace and security will be advanced in
accordance with the �ational Action Plan �Women, Peace and Security’.

Finland participates in military crisis management in accordance with its
foreign and security policy goals and at a level which sustains Finland’s long�
term commitment to and development of peace and stability, and takes into
account Finland’s decades�long tradition of participating in peacekeeping and
military crisis management operations. This strengthens Finland’s international
standing and indicates a clear desire to participate in international burden�
sharing� it also calls for suf�cient training and resources.

The decision to participate in a crisis management operation will be based on
foreign and security policy considerations, taking into account the needs of the
crisis area and the operation, available capabilities and �nancial resources. The
decision�making process will also evaluate the impact of our participation and
any possible bene�ts to our military capabilities. Finland will primarily offer the
assets to operations which are included in Finland’s troop register.

The budget proposal will prepare to �nance ongoing operations or those
in which Finland has already decided to participate. �ew operations will be
�nanced through supplementary budgets. In addition, with supplementary
budget provision, it is possible to cover the �nancing of additional costs arising
from operations or to facilitate the continuance of operations, any potential new
crisis management operations as well as other crisis management expenses.

Finland’s crisis management participation continues to emphasise expertise
in police, rule of law, border management, human rights and gender equality
issues. The main focus is on the E�’s civilian crisis management operations.
Finland also participates in the ��’s efforts in promoting international security
and stability by allocating civilian assets, stressing the improvement of police
activities and the rule of law.

Finland also aims to improve the impact of its participation in civilian crisis
management. The goal is to second approximately �5� Finnish experts
to civilian crisis management operations. �et another goal is to have Finns
selected to leadership positions of missions. The increasing demands and risks
to civilian crisis management experts in operations will be taken into account.
Suf�cient resources will be earmarked for the purpose of seconding Finnish
experts to civilian crisis management tasks.

84


-----

The need to review international crisis management legislation or that related
to other possible international cooperation will be determined later. The aim is
to begin the review during this Government term.

###### Development of multinational defence cooperation

Active defence cooperation bolsters regional stability and increases the
credibility of defence. Fully��edged participation in multinational cooperation
makes it possible for Finland to in�uence decisions on new cooperation areas,
procedures and structures. Situation awareness and international in�uencing
also demand appropriate representation in international structures.

Finland is already dependent on multinational cooperation in the development
and maintenance of military capabilities. It is necessary to intensify cooperation
in order to secure the capabilities. Finland participates in defence cooperation
in the �ordic context, in the E�, within the framework of �AT� partnership
and bilaterally. The goals of cooperation in the different combinations and
structures are mutually reinforcing and complementary. Finland sets out with
the purpose of achieving practical and �exible cooperation, while keeping in
mind the equal opportunities of the domestic defence industry in relation to
their �ordic and European competitors.

Finland believes that the E� needs to develop a common vision for foreign,
security and defence policy, and politically commit to the collective development,
maintenance, pooling and sharing of military capabilities.

In particular, Finland supports the intensi�cation of �ordic defence cooperation.
The goal is to create a common desired end state for �ordic cooperation to
advance its expansion and intensi�cation. Finland supports the development
of cooperation related to the creation, maintenance and use of national and
shared capabilities, and that of associated modi operandi. The capability for
joint operations both at home and in Finland’s neighbourhood as well as in
crisis management operations, including cooperation in defence training and
exercises, is being further honed.

From the Finnish perspective the E�’s Battle Groups �E�BG� and participation
in the activities supplementing the �AT� Response Force ��RF� as well as
international training and exercises are key practical instruments when it
comes to developing the Defence Forces’ capabilities and interoperability.

Finland, at its discretion, continues to participate in the E�BGs and supports
an increase in their capacity and deployability. Finland also continues to

85


-----

participate in the activities supplementing the �RF. The primary goal of
Finland’s participation is to improve the capabilities needed in military crisis
management. However, the participation also improves the national defence
capability and the facilities of receiving assistance from abroad.

###### Arms control

Finland highlights the importance of the �� as the keystone of multilateral
arms control and disarmament structures, and as the primary forum for
treaty regimes. Finland emphasises the need to intensify the implementation
of arms control arrangements and to improve their monitoring mechanisms.
Developing countries will be supported within available means so that they,
too, can commit to international arms control obligations.

Finland participates in arms control, disarmament and non�proliferation
negotiation processes. Finland tries to actively in�uence them, conducting a
comprehensive analysis regarding the adoption of any new commitments at
the completion of each process.

In its own defence arrangements Finland takes into account the existing
international standards and its own obligations. Finnish defence planning
also tries to anticipate the development of the standards, the humanitarian
acceptability of weapon systems and the availability of weapons systems in
the international market.

The signi�cance of the Treaty on the �on�Proliferation of �uclear Weapons
��PT� as the cornerstone of the international nuclear arms control regime is
pivotal. Finland underscores all pillars of the �PT. Through its own action Finland
strives to advance transparency related to nuclear weapons, mitigate the risks
of accidents and misunderstandings, and promote nuclear disarmament.

In addition to bilateral treaties, the Geneva Conference on Disarmament
should produce results, �rst and foremost, on its primary goal, the Fissile
Material Cut�off Treaty �FMCT�. Tactical nuclear weapons should be included in
the multilateral arms control and disarmament regime. It is imperative that the
Comprehensive �uclear�Test�Ban Treaty �CTBT� enter into force.

Finland actively promotes the non�proliferation of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons and their means of delivery as well as related materials
and know�how pursuant to, among others, �� Security Council Resolution
�5��, the G��launched Global Partnership, the �S�Russian launched Global

86


-----

Initiative to Combat �uclear Terrorism and the Proliferation Security Initiative
launched by the �SA.

In view of biological threats, Finland also pursues international and national
cooperation between the security and the health authorities. Finland actively
advances the non�proliferation of chemical weapons and the development of
means for the veri�cation of chemical agents.

Finland has acceded to the �ttawa Convention banning anti�personnel
landmines. In accordance with the Convention Finland’s anti�personnel mine
stockpiles will be destroyed within four years of its entry into force for Finland.
Finland also continues its active participation in humanitarian mine action.

Finland is not a state party to the �slo Convention on Cluster Munitions.
However, Finland supports the goals of the convention as well as the attempts
to universalise it, and participates in the implementation of the convention
through humanitarian mine action. From the Finnish perspective no such
changes in conditions have taken place which would enable accession to
the convention. Finland actively strives for the �nalisation and the possible
implementation of an Arms Trade Treaty which would extensively, effectively
and comprehensively regulate the international arms trade. Finland continues
its efforts to actively curb the illicit spread of small arms and light weapons
�SALW� and to minimise the human rights and security problems caused by
SALW.

Finland also actively participates in processes related to the development of
international humanitarian law.

Finland participates in the development of international export control
arrangements. Finland complies in its export controls with E� regulations and
criteria provided by the E� Common Position, which Finland aims to improve
and strengthen. Arms exports are forbidden in a situation in which there is
ample reason to believe that they will be used in human rights violations.

###### 4.5 Advancing security in Finland’s neighbourhood 

Finland also fully utilises the opportunities of the intensifying �ordic cooperation
in security and defence policy.

Finland improves its bilateral cooperation with the Baltic states, in the E�
and other international fora. Finland supports closer cooperation between the

87


-----

�ordic countries and Baltic states and promotes collaboration in the Baltic Sea
area as regards the economy, environmental protection, border control and
border management cooperation as well as maritime safety and transboundary
crime prevention. The aforementioned cooperation is being developed within
the framework of the E� as well as regionally and bilaterally.

Alongside sector�speci�c action the Council of the Baltic Sea States plays a
central role as an intergovernmental policy cooperation forum. Finland advocates
the effective implementation of the E� Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region and
the earmarking of suf�cient funding for it. Finland supports improvements
in the marine environment of the Baltic Sea through the Baltic Sea Action
process and within the framework of the Baltic Marine Environment Protection
Commission �HELC�M�. Finland actively participates in the implementation
of the E�’s Integrated Maritime Policy with the aim of improving the marine
environment of the Baltic Sea.

The Government will establish how the special status of the Åland Islands will
be taken into consideration during potential oil spills and other crises, and how
to ensure the appropriate authorities’ suf�cient preparedness.

Arctic cooperation is being improved in the Arctic Council, the Barents Euro�
Arctic Council and the �ordic Council of Ministers, as well as other venues.
Finland supports the strengthening of the Arctic Council as an organisation.
Regarding the use of natural resources Finland aims to contribute to the
peaceful settlement of disputes under international law. Finland advances a
more vigorous E� Arctic policy and an observer status for the E� in the Arctic
Council.

Finland considers it important to improve the �ow of information and
transparency regarding accident risks related to nuclear power plants, nuclear
submarines and tactical nuclear weapons in Finland’s near environs.

�n the basis of reciprocity Finland promotes the free movement of persons
between Finland and Russia, and supports the E�’s goals in advancing visa�
free travel in accordance with the terms and conditions agreed between the
E� and Russia. For the purpose of managing the increasing border traf�c it is
important to establish the E�’s and national technical systems early enough
for visa�free travel.

###### 4.6 Security solidarity

 The Solidarity Clause included in the Treaty of Lisbon (terrorist strikes, disasters)

Finland prepares to act in accordance with the solidarity clause �TFE� Art ����,
and develops and maintains the necessary preparedness to provide and receive
the assistance included in the solidarity clause. Finland will see to it that there
are no national legislative impediments to the implementation of the solidarity
clause in Finnish territory or for Finland’s action, should another Member State
become the object of a terrorist attack or the victim of a natural or man�made
disaster and ask for assistance. This will require changes in Finnish legislation.
The goal is to determine the need for legislative review during the term of
of�ce of this Government. Moreover, Finland will make certain that suf�cient
resources are earmarked for the implementation of the clause. Finland actively
participates in the debate on the implementation of the solidarity clause and
advocates the creation of rules required by the implementation of the solidarity
clause in the Lisbon Treaty.

Finland considers it important that the E� Member States develop their
capabilities in providing and receiving assistance in accordance with the clause.

Finland also believes that the existing assistance mechanisms should be more
effectively utilised. There are already mechanisms that facilitate cooperation
between Member States such as bilateral and multilateral treaty arrangements,
rapid alert systems and assistance arrangements at �nion level as well as
judicial and executive assistance mechanisms.

Finland regards it as important that, in accordance with the ���� �ordic
declaration on solidarity, the �ordic countries also further develop their
capabilities to provide assistance to each other following terrorist attacks,
natural disasters or cyber attacks.

###### Special provisions to the Common Security and Defence Policy  of the Lisbon Treaty: the Mutual Assistance Clause (armed attack)

Finland regards that the mutual assistance clause included in the Treaty of
Lisbon �TE� Art ������ should be interpreted so that it also demands the
preparedness to provide assistance should one Member State become the
victim of armed attack. Invoking the obligation does not require a decision
at �nion level. The clause does not grant competences to the �nion. Each
Member State will individually take a decision as regards the provision of, and

89


-----

forms of, assistance. The E�’s Member States who are also �AT� members will
implement their national defence within the framework of the Alliance.

The E� Member States have not discussed the implementation of the mutual
assistance obligation. Finland will improve its capacity to provide and receive
assistance and, during the present Government’s term in of�ce, aim to
determine the needs to review its legislation so as to enable the implementation
of the clause.

In its own policy Finland takes into account the fact that the �nion does not
have any defence planning of its own, nor common defence arrangements.
Finland advocates the development of the common security and defence
policy, which will facilitate the ability to receive and provide assistance.

**The EU’s Solidarity Clause**

“(TFEU Art 222) “1. The Union and its Member States shall act jointly in a spirit of solidarity
if a Member State is the object of a terrorist attack or the victim of a natural or man-made
disaster. The Union shall mobilise all the instruments at its disposal, including the military
resources made available by the Member States, to:

(a) prevent the terrorist threat in the territory of the Member States;
– protect democratic institutions and the civilian population from any terrorist attack;
– assist a Member State in its territory, at the request of its political authorities, in the event
of a terrorist attack;

(b) assist a Member State in its territory, at the request of its political authorities, in the event
of a natural or man-made disaster.

2. Should a Member State be the object of a terrorist attack or the victim of a natural or manmade disaster, the other Member States shall assist it at the request of its political authorities.
To that end, the Member States shall coordinate between themselves in the Council.

3. The arrangements for the implementation by the Union of the solidarity clause shall be
defined by a decision adopted by the Council acting on a joint proposal by the Commission
and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. The Council
shall act in accordance with Article 31(1) of the Treaty on European Union where this decision
has defence implications. The European Parliament shall be informed.

For the purposes of this paragraph and without prejudice to Article 240, the Council shall be
assisted by the Political and Security Committee with the support of the structures developed
in the context of the common security and defence policy and by the Committee referred to
in Article 71; the two committees shall, if necessary, submit joint opinions.

4. The European Council shall regularly assess the threats facing the Union in order to enable
the Union and its Member States to take effective action.”

###### 4.7 Securing the functioning of society – comprehensive security

Increasing international interaction and interdependence bring more
prosperity and bene�ts to Finns. The success of society will continue to be
built on transparency and extensive civil liberties and rights, while at the same
time ensuring suf�cient government controls and emergency management
capacities. These are the underlying premises of Finland’s security and defence
policy, which also include the consideration of society’s preparedness.

Finland has a well�functioning, trusted by its citizens, tradition of preparedness.
For decades this has established the basis for cooperative arrangements between
the different actors of society. Comprehensive security has been developed in
concert with the authorities, the business community and organisations. Each
actor aims to further develop the cooperation. It is increasingly important to
engage citizens in security�related activities and to improve their competences.

Society’s preparedness for emergency conditions and serious disruptions is
built on the comprehensive concept of security and the subsequent Security
Strategy for Society �Government Resolution, �����. Future challenges demand
a comprehensive and networked approach as well as strategic agility vis���vis
the changes in the operating environment. The Security Strategy for Society,
which is built on these premises, covers both internal and external threats –
without distinction – and provides a common baseline for contingency planning,
division of responsibilities and the implementation of action.

The preparedness of Finnish society materialises under the comprehensive
concept of security, which means that society’s vital functions are secured
through collaboration between the authorities, the business community,
organisations and citizens.

91


-----

The Security Strategy for Society de�nes the comprehensive concept of security,
and the duties of the administrative branches are given in the Government
Resolution on the Strategy for Security in Society. The Strategy consolidates
the comprehensive concept of security as the common concept and model
of preparedness. In addition, it transforms the present Security and Defence
Committee into a more wide�ranging and broad�based Security Committee. The
Committee assists the Government and ministries in comprehensive security
preparedness and in its coordination. It monitors and analyses the impacts
of the changes in Finland’s security and defence policy environment, and
society in general, on comprehensive security arrangements. The Committee
also monitors the action of different administrative branches and levels of
administration as regards the maintenance and development of comprehensive
security arrangements. If necessary, the Security Committee also coordinates
large and important contingency�related issues, such as the harmonisation of
preparedness at the state level, the development of collaborative models, modi
operandi, research and improvements in training.

The Government Security and Defence Policy Report is the central steering
document that extends beyond several Government terms and, as per
the comprehensive concept of security, lays down the key guidelines for
comprehensive security. The principles of implementing the comprehensive
concept of security are explained in the Government Resolution on the
Strategy for Security in Society. The concrete guidelines for its implementation
are given in the Government Programme, Government decisions, the
competent administrative branches’ operating and �nancial plans, and other
strategy documents such as the Government Decision on the �bjectives of
Security of Supply, the Internal Security Programme and the Action Plan on
�ational Information Security Strategy. The authorities, working together with
the business community and organisations, are responsible for the practical
implementation.

###### 4.8 Guidelines for developing the implementation  of comprehensive security

The changes in the Report’s operating environment and in the possible use
of force have diverse effects on the manner in which society’s functions are
secured. When it comes to comprehensive security the key challenge relates to
the growing interdependence between global and national systems. Systems’
operating logics often fail to comply with the control attempts of administrative
sectors or markets. While increasingly high�speed communications intensify

92


-----

cooperation between security operators, they also make it ever more dif�cult
to curb the spread of incorrect information or malware.

The business community is increasingly important in securing the vital
functions of society. The contingency plans of large companies and critical
service providers are an important part of comprehensive security. Issues
related to security of supply, service agreements and other cooperation with
the authorities require increased availability and awareness of legislation and
contractual and application guides. The key players of the business community
must be utilised at all collaborative fora of security development.

As a result of the changes in the operating environment it is all the more
important to be able to more comprehensively identify and analyse the
indirect and immediate interrelationships of threats. The coordination of
multidimensional skills at all levels of the administration is essential so as
to improve comprehensive security and optimise resources. Comprehensive
security�thinking, emerging from collaboration, also supports the discovery of
anticipatory action and cost�effective solutions.

###### The central role of the European Union in preserving the comprehensive security of society

The E� has competences with regard to several key areas of comprehensive
security of society. These areas relate to the security and well�being of the
population and to sustaining the viability of society. Whereas in some areas the
E�’s competence is exclusive, which means that only the E� enacts legislation
and signs international treaties in these areas, in other areas the E� shares
competence with its Member States. Additionally, in certain areas the �nion
either implements measures that complement the actions of its Member States,
or the Member States coordinate their own policies.

###### Utilisation of international cooperation

The interdependence of the global security environment as well as threat
prevention and management require extensive international cooperation
in foreign and security policy and on a practical level between the security
authorities. As a part of European and global collaborative structures
and organisations, one must prepare to prevent and repel wide�ranging,
transboundary threats and problems. Intersectoral cooperation must be
intensi�ed due to the nature of crises and threats, and to facilitate the effective
use of society’s resources.

93


-----

International cooperation associated with internal security also strengthens
Finland’s foreign policy and national security. �ey international cooperation
areas related to internal security include counter�terrorism and organised
crime, better border management, immigration control, participation in
international civil emergency preparedness cooperation and other crisis
assistance. The European �nion is Finland’s central frame of reference when
it comes to maintaining and improving security. It is important that Finland
participate in the development of the E�’s border, maritime, immigration and
common asylum policies, and in the development of associated European
facilities. Finland actively participates in the operation of the European border
management agency FR��TE� and the European Asylum Support �f�ce. This
advances border management and immigration control in Europe and the
capacity of the E�’s neighbours and, consequently, positive development of
the security environment in the European neighbourhood.

International cooperation in the exchange of information and security research
is crucial regarding the accurate anticipation of changes in the operating
environment and responding to threats. The importance of the security of
information�related agreements which Finland has signed with other states
and international organisations such as the E�, �AT� and the ESA �European
Space Agency� culminates in the exchange of classi�ed information. This,
for its part, increases the need for Finland to secure the preconditions of its
national security authorities ��ational Security Authority �SA – Designated
Security Authority DSA� in all situations.

###### The development of security expertise

The comprehensive nature of security and the interdependence of its many
branches demand research and development which, especially, supports
practical action. Research guidance and cooperation between universities,
research institutes, the security sector’s educational establishments and other
actors involved in security research or funding must be further improved. The
utilisation of the results of research and the development of preparedness
must be more systematic. For example, operational environment analysis, an
intersectoral research programme, will eventually support the drafting of future
reports and other studies. These matters must be taken into consideration
when the �ational Security Research Strategy is updated into a security
research action plan in ����. Comprehensive security research themes must
be considered as an entirety, encompassing the vital functions of society,
developments in the operating environment and trend assessments. Guidance
will be provided by the respective administrative branches’ research units,
supported by the future Security Committee.

94


-----

The development of security expertise is important from the standpoint of
society’s comprehensive security. The citizens’ security preparedness must be
enhanced by improving the access to information as well as the quality of
instructions. �rganisations play a central role in this process and the authorities
must support them. While the citizens’ skills are being improved, the process
must simultaneously aim to improve communality and prevent social exclusion.
Professionals in the security sector, be they in the public sector, the business
community or the private sector, must be able to evaluate threats and their
possible consequences in a wider context than that of their own.

###### Improving situation awareness and communications

The national ability to compile and maintain a comprehensive situation picture
on the vital functions of society, and to analyse and manage activities during
disruptions and emergency conditions demands further improvement. When it
comes to developing comprehensive security and disturbance management, the
importance of situation awareness cuts across all levels of the administration
and society. The Government situation awareness activities are being reformed,
and the development of situation picture dissemination and comprehensive
situation awareness coordination is being further advanced by drafting a
national risk analysis on the basis of the threat scenarios given in the Security
Strategy for Society.

Crisis communications will be further improved and strategic communications
will be harmonised between the state leadership and administrative branches.
The goal is to provide prognostic and coordinated communications during
various crises. Communications constitute an elemental part of the effectiveness
of leadership and management, and different perspectives must be taken into
consideration in all plans and exercises related to comprehensive security.

###### Making exercises more methodical

Good preparedness in preventing and repelling threats and managing their
consequences calls for systematic exercises. Exercises that test society’s
crisis preparedness and the methods of evaluating the implementation of
strategies must continually be improved. The state leadership’s preparedness
exercise VALHA is organised once every four years during the �rst half of every
Government’s term of of�ce. Maintaining and developing the preparedness of
administrative branches and sectors requires a systematic development and
testing system. The administrative branches must draw up plans for developing
the functions that the preparedness concepts included in their strategic tasks
entail.

95


-----

###### Advancing the security of municipalities and regions

Municipalities organise welfare and security services at the local level.
Municipalities have a central role in preparedness because they are responsible
for setting up basic services and several other functions vital to society. It
is not practicable to establish all�embracing security expertise in every
municipality. Cooperation between the municipalities, supported by the
regional administration, must be improved. Existing regional security networks
must be utilised in regional development. Municipalities must see to it that
they themselves, their cooperative structures and private service providers are
prepared for disruptions, and that they have up�to�date and tested contingency
and continuity management plans.

�rganisations and the business community closely participate in continuity
management planning. Preparedness and continuity management perspectives
must be taken into consideration when the service structure of social and health
services is being created, so that new structures and service areas support
intersectoral cooperation and continuity management. Municipalities’ access
to national and regional assistance will be improved, especially with regard
to rapidly escalating and widespread disruptions. The respective boundaries
of the state’s regional actors and municipalities’ collaborative sectors will
be synchronised. Along with the past and present changes of the different
authorities’ regional division of duties it is important to make certain that the
roles and responsibilities related to security remain clear.

###### Security of supply and continuity management

Security of supply is playing an ever more important role in the development
of society’s comprehensive security because the private sector has taken
over an increasingly large share of society’s vital functions. �ew ownership
arrangements and business structures as well as international dependences
brought on by globalisation pose challenges to security of supply.

Government Resolutions on the �bjectives of Security of Supply steer the
activities related to security of supply. The basic goal of security of supply
has been to sustain the livelihood and functioning of the population as well
as critical infrastructure and production during serious disruptions in normal
conditions, and in emergency conditions.

The present Government Resolution on Security of Supply will be updated
by the spring of ����. Since the economic environment and threat scenarios
have changed, the revised Resolution will be built on an extensive analysis
of trends, risks and threats in the operating environment, including their

96


-----

impact on security of supply. The Government Resolution on the �bjectives
of Security of Supply will determine the focus areas for the coming years
and take into account the challenges brought on by the networked society’s
interdependences, from both national and international perspectives.

In order to guarantee the basic goals of security of supply, continuity
management, including organisational safety, will be developed particularly
with regard to the critical actors in the security of supply�chain.

**Security of Supply**

Security of supply refers to the capability of sustaining such basic economic functions of
society which are vital to the livelihood of the population, the viability and security of society
and securing the material preconditions of national defence during serious disruptions and
emergency conditions. The National Emergency Supply Agency, a public body, is responsible
for the tasks related to the coordination, development, and maintenance of security of supply.

Security of supply relies on functioning markets and a competitive economy. Nonetheless,
markets alone will not necessarily sustain society’s economic and technological basic
functions during various disruptions and emergency conditions. Hence, preparations to sustain
the vital functions of society are done through different security of supply-measures even in
emergency conditions. The instruments include emergency stockpiling of critical products,
legislation on preparedness as well as financial and economic policy, international security
of supply-cooperation, and voluntary continuity management planning and preparedness in
critical companies and organisations.

Finland’s emergency preparedness is built on the solid tradition of cooperation between
the central government and the business community. Security of supply-related activities
are organised as a comprehensive collaborative network which flexibly and cost-effectively
develops society’s crisis resilience through voluntary public-private partnerships.

###### National cyber security

Cyber threats pose a wide�ranging and serious challenge to comprehensive
security. Cyber threats have become more dangerous to society in general. In
addition to information security violations and cybercrime, cyber attacks can
be used as a means of political and economic pressure: in a serious crisis they
can be employed as an instrument of in�uence alongside traditional means of
military force.

Finland’s cyber response capability is closely connected with international
cooperation. Cyber security, including its ancillary tasks, provides an example
of a comprehensive security challenge affecting all administrative branches. In
addition to networked cooperation the compilation of a cyber security picture

97


-----

along with continuous forecasting and analysis require centralised solutions
such as the Government Situation Centre and the Cyber Security Centre.

The national Cyber Security Strategy, to be completed in early ����, lays the
foundation for cyber security arrangements in Finland. The Strategy extensively
utilises the expertise of society’s security actors, especially that of the business
community. The guidelines of the Cyber Security Strategy will be put into
practice through an action plan which will be drafted in ����.

###### Securing the capacity of security authorities

The capacity of the security authorities must be maintained in all situations.
All threat scenarios must include extensive preparedness. The support
society gives to comprehensive security and national defence requires ever
more intensive networking. Reliance on society’s security of supply and,
subsequently, on production that supports the military defence and security
as well as system maintenance, keeps growing. Due to the interdependence
of national and international security the tasks of the Defence Forces, i.e.
the military defence of Finland, interauthority cooperation and international
military crisis management will be more intertwined in the future.

While Finland prepares to defend itself, it must also be able to protect
the population and secure the viability of society. In accordance with the
Government Programme a separate report will assess the need to build more
civil defence shelters.

#### 5 Developing Finland’s defence

###### 5.1 Defence policy

Defence policy measures advance Finland’s security, support national foreign
and security policy decision�making and create the preconditions for the
maintenance and development of the defence capability. Having an active
defence policy guarantees a wide range of instruments available to the state
leadership and supports the realisation of Finland’s foreign and security policy
goals.

The key objectives of Finland’s defence development are the maintenance
of a defence capability tailored to our security environment and resources,
defence development as part of comprehensive security and the intensi�cation

98


-----

of multinational defence cooperation, which also serves the goals of Finland’s
crisis management participation.

In the desired end state, in the ����s Finland will have the capability,
respected by the state leadership and others, to defend the country and
its independence, sustain the livelihood of its citizens and, in concert with
international actors, manage security threats. Finland advances its security
by maintaining capable defence forces in accordance with the comprehensive
concept of security, by participating in crisis management and through active
international cooperation.

The primary objective of the defence capability is to establish deterrence
against the use of military force and the threat thereof. Should Finland become
the victim of armed aggression the vital functions of society will be protected
and the attack will be repelled.

Preparedness against the use of military force, or the threat thereof, requires
such military capabilities which raise the threshold against the use of force
on Finland and make any military action ineffective. In normal conditions the
capabilities needed for territorial surveillance and the protection of territorial
integrity are emphasised.

Foreign actors continually evaluate Finland’s defence capability and its
development. The assessments of our deterrence comprise a number of
factors. At the political and societal level the evaluation includes political
and economic stability, the decision�making capability, resources allocated
to defence, the will to defend the country, and the scope and depth of our
international cooperation. The military assessment focuses on the entirety
of our military capabilities. The key factors include command and control,
intelligence, surveillance and logistics systems, as well as the readiness and
mobilisation capability, the level of training and equipment, the capabilities of
the units and weapon systems and the skills of the personnel. In particular,
the most capable and rapidly deployable troops and weapon systems are able
to raise the threshold against the use of force and, if necessary, begin to repel
an attack.

As a militarily non�aligned country Finland prepares to repel military threats
without outside assistance. Consequently, it maintains all capability areas of
the defence system. The nucleus of Finland’s defence is the military defence
capability generated by the Defence Forces. The Finnish Defence Forces must
retain control over all of the critical capabilities of the military defence system.

99


-----

Military defence is a part of society’s comprehensive security. Crises increasingly
affect all sectors of society, and it is dif�cult to limit them. While the growing
interdependence increases risks and the vulnerability of society, it also enables
the bene�ts that can be obtained through intensifying cooperation.

Securing the vital functions of society, crisis resilience and security of supply as
well as guaranteeing critical competence are pivotal factors which also affect
defence. Society’s support is critical to the implementation of defence during
a crisis, just as the support of the Defence Forces is valuable to securing
the effectiveness of the civilian authorities’ activities. It will be increasingly
challenging to allocate society’s resources to protracted, wide�ranging defence
activities in the future. The private sector has taken over an ever�growing
share and responsibility of society’s critical resources and vital functions. In
order to meet the requirements of emergency conditions, cooperation with
strategic and other partners, government authorities, businesses and �G�s is
being intensi�ed. Partnership is a feature of managing wartime capabilities and
life cycle costs as well as the cost�effectiveness of the defence.

Multinational defence cooperation strengthens the defence capability and
ensures the development of military capabilities. In the most important areas
cooperation can be achieved via several venues by avoiding unnecessary
duplication. By participating in defence cooperation Finland can also in�uence
its content and structures. It is particularly important for Finland to maximise
its in�uence so as to be able to add in the special requirements arising from our
defence solution. Interaction within international structures and organisations,
for its part, improves our situation awareness and the ability to pre�emptively
in�uence crisis resolution in the regions of their origin.

Active defence cooperation improves Finland’s deterrence. While the cooperation
does not provide any security guarantees, it facilitates the reception of political,
military and other assistance should Finland’s resources prove inadequate. In
return, Finland must be ready and able to provide military and other assistance
to others when required.

Cooperation takes place under the auspices of the E� and �AT� partnership,
in regional groups and bilaterally. The E� and �AT� play supportive roles in
multinational projects. Tangible collaboration between willing partners occurs
in country groupings, of which the most important from Finland’s perspective
is the �ordic defence cooperation arrangement ��RDEFC�. �ther important
cooperation partners for Finland are especially the �nited States and the
countries in �orthern Europe. Cooperation promotes military interoperability,
the creation and development of capabilities, and strengthens our faculty for

100


-----

international crisis management participation. �AT� standards and procedures
are the mainstay of interoperability.

�ordic defence cooperation has signi�cantly intensi�ed in recent years. �ordic
cooperation attempts to achieve synergies while aiming to gain operational,
economic, technical and industrial added value. This collaboration also strives
for interoperability which would facilitate intensi�ed and more wide�ranging
cooperation to supplement national defence solutions and capabilities. �ordic
cooperation areas are the following: defence policy, strategic development,
capabilities, human resources and education, training and exercises, and
operations. The �ordic countries are, politically and militarily, deeply committed
to the development and intensi�cation of defence cooperation. Finland is an
active participant in this process.

Multinational exercises and international rapid response force pools will become
increasingly important as vehicles for maintaining and improving interoperability.
The Defence Forces develop their capabilities and interoperability, especially
by participating in the E�’s battle groups and in activities supplementing the
�AT� Response Force ��RF�, and associated exercises.

Participation in military crisis management strengthens Finland’s defence
capability. The goal of preparation and implementation is to guarantee the
effectiveness of the participation. The quantitative and qualitative goals of
operational participation are set on a case�by�case basis.

###### 5.2 Using and developing the defence system

Finland demonstrates its defence capability through territorial surveillance and
by protecting its territorial integrity, through national training and exercises,
through participation in military crisis management, and through a strong will
to defend the country.

Finland’s defence underscores good situation awareness and command and
control capability, joint effects and the ability to exploit the strengths of its
own territory. Defence readiness is regulated to correspond to the prevailing
security environment.

101


-----

In ���5 the wartime strength of the Defence Forces will be approximately
��� ��� troops. The aim is to have more capable units and weapon systems
in order to compensate for the reduction in troop strengths. The formation of
regional troops alongside operational and territorial units will bolster the local
defence capability.

Defence development will be built on the long�term policies adopted over
the past two decades and investments in weapon systems, know�how and
infrastructure, among other things. The focus has been on defence readiness
and the capability to prevent and repel a strategic strike. Furthermore, a
defence capability suf�cient to repel any armed aggression aimed at seizing
territory has been maintained and the preparedness to participate in military
crisis management missions has been improved. Troop performance has been
maintained and developed through better skills and training as well as materiel
acquisitions.

The command and control system creates the preconditions for managing and
using the defence system at the different levels of hierarchy. The development
of operational command and control will lead towards an integrated system,

102


-----

and the system’s robustness and usability will be improved. The development
will take into account the requirements of network�centric warfare. The
Defence Forces’ cyber capabilities will be created as part of the Defence Forces’
command and control system and society’s comprehensive security.

The intelligence and surveillance system generates a situation picture and an
analysis in all readiness conditions. These generate situation awareness and
early�warning, and support the selection of desirable targets. The development
of the system must ensure the creation of a sound entity that comprises
intelligence, surveillance and battle�eld targeting support.

The logistics system is an elemental part of the military defence. It comprises
defence logistics as well as society’s logistic components and functions, i.e.
strategic partnerships and outsourced services. The logistics system must be
viable in national and international settings. The focus of its development is on
the capability to support the military services’ operational troops.

The Defence Forces’ regular personnel and the most rapidly deployable
wartime troops will be used in responding to military pressure. They also raise
the threshold against the use of force and, if necessary, will be used in the
initial phases of repelling an attack. The defence system will be used to deny
the adversary’s freedom of action, break down his order of battle, repel his
attacks and protect important targets.

The Defence Forces’ troops and systems create the defence capability.
�perations in which the most capable troops and systems participate create
the centre of gravity for defence and the preconditions for the decisive battles.
Long�range standoff weapon systems support the operations. Information
operations, consisting of cyber operations, electronic warfare and psychological
operations are executed during all stages of a crisis. The creation of the defence
system’s most important capabilities will be secured. Development focuses on
the functioning and robustness of intelligence, surveillance and C� systems, as
well as interoperability, the range and speed of �re, troop mobility and force
protection. Development must also take into account the capability to receive
assistance from abroad.

The Army is the most important service in active defence and decisive battles.
Ground defence will hold up and gradually wear down the adversary, retain
control over key military areas, repel attacks, protect society’s vital functions
and targets and, ultimately, defeat the aggressor.

103


-----

The capability of the Army’s operational troops to �ght decisive battles requires
the maintenance and development of �repower, mobility and force protection.
Heavy rocket artillery, �eld artillery and countermobility capabilities are the
key elements of the Army’s effect. The most important territorial units are
trained to �ght active defensive battles. They will be used in pinning down
and weakening the aggressor, repelling attacks and retaining control over
important strategic points. In accordance with the new battle tactics the Army
troops will operate actively and �exibly, and will be capable of dispersed action.
At �rst the Army will focus on developing its territorial troops. As of ���� the
emphasis will shift to operational troops.

Local defence will be strengthened by the introduction of regional units.
Among other things, regional troops will be used locally in combat tasks, target
protection and surveillance functions, in mobilising other units, supporting
territorial and operational troops, maintaining contact with the authorities
and in assisting them. Regional troops also help associate voluntary defence
activities with the Defence Forces and comprehensive security. The composition
and materiel of regional units will be tailored to suit their tasks and their area
of operations. �nits will incorporate suitable functions related to voluntary
defence and comprehensive security.

Maritime defence focuses on maritime surveillance, safeguarding the vital sea
lines of communication and repelling naval attacks. Missile and mine warfare
are the mainstay of the �avy’s effect. The vessels of the naval combat units
must be maintained and improved so as to be able to safeguard the vital
sea lines of communication and deny the adversary his freedom of operation
in key areas. The night�vision capabilities and mobility of amphibious and
coastal units will be improved so that they can successfully implement coastal
surveillance and coastal defence.

Air defence focuses on air surveillance, protecting nationally important targets
and repelling air attacks. Fighter aircraft and anti�aircraft missile units form the
framework of the air defence system. The development of an air�to�ground
capability will continue while maintaining the performance of �ghter defence.
The life cycle of the present F��� �ghter aircraft will be utilised as cost�
effectively as possible into the late ����s. The air defence of important targets
and troops will be improved by ground�based air defence system acquisitions.

The Finnish Border Guard, an integral element of the defence system,
participate in the defence of the nation. The Border Guard’s defence plans and
preparations, related to the defence of the nation, are implemented in close
cooperation with the Defence Forces. Should defence readiness so require,

104


-----

Border Guard units, or parts thereof, can be seconded to the Defence Forces
as an element of the military defence system.

The Defence Forces prepare to support other authorities on the basis of their
requests for executive assistance, or in accordance with jointly implemented
contingency plans. Preparedness is built on common planning and exercises.
The support can include military capabilities which the other authorities do not
then need to acquire, so as to avoid unnecessary duplication. In practice these
can include niche capabilities, special equipment and materiel, personnel,
logistics or command and control systems, among other things. Some of
the Defence Forces’ capabilities are readily available in normal conditions.
These include assets such as helicopters, aircraft, ships, executive assistance
detachments, special forces, �rst responders and other niche capabilities �e.g.
CBR�: chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear�. The usability of these
capabilities is ensured through investments in suf�cient personnel, know�how
and materiel.

All of the services’ units can be used in military crisis management tasks. First
and foremost, units having undergone troop production and evaluation will be
deployed to crisis management missions. In accordance with E�BG and �AT�
Response Force classi�cations, the units participating in crisis management are
divided into rapid response and lower readiness units, and niche capabilities.
A versatile crisis management troop register best enables comprehensive crisis
management participation, allowing for �exible decision�making.

Military crisis management capabilities are also prepared to be used in support
of other crisis management actors. The support may include things such as
materiel, logistics and expert assistance as well as the exchange of a situation
picture. Along with military crisis management operations the Defence Forces
must have the readiness to provide expert assistance as well as training and
support associated with security sector reform. The lessons learned from the
latest operations in Afghanistan, Chad and the Horn of Africa are taken into
consideration in capability development.

###### 5.3 Defence Forces Reform and the Defence Forces’  peacetime organisation in 2015

The Finnish Defence Forces will implement a reform by the year ���5. The
reform is a precondition for the capacity and further development of the
Defence Forces as the defence for the ����s is being built.

During the past two decades the Defence Forces’ command and administrative
structures have undergone several reforms. The need for a more thoroughgoing
reform was already identi�ed before the present challenging situation in the
state economy. �ey causes for the transformation include the rising operational
costs, defence materiel becoming obsolete and smaller age groups in national
service. Internal cost pressures and the in�exible structure of the budget
have resulted in a signi�cant reduction in the level of activities and cuts in
procurements. The saving targets in the ��������� decisions on spending

limits make the reform all the more urgent and, therefore, signi�cant cuts have
been instituted to the level of activities and acquisitions.

The key goals of the reform include both restoring the volume of training
and exercises to a level which corresponds to the training requirements and
safeguarding the necessary investments in materiel. The reform centralises
the Defence Forces’ intelligence, logistics and support functions as well as
research and planning. The number of personnel will be reduced and wartime
troop strengths will decrease. At the same time unnecessary premises will be
closed. The Defence Forces’ peacetime command structure will be changed
into a three�tier arrangement by abolishing the regional commands and their
headquarters. The number and structure of units that train conscripts will
be adjusted to coincide with the diminishing age group and wartime force
generation needs.

In administrative matters the Defence Forces are subordinate to the Ministry
of Defence. The Defence Command is a central government agency and
the supreme headquarters of the Defence Forces. It is also the command
headquarters of the Chief of Defence. The Defence Command has the capability
to lead defence planning and development, and the creation, maintenance
and use of the defence capability. The Defence Command’s subordinate
establishments are the Defence Forces C� Agency, the Defence Forces Service
Centre, the Defence Forces Military Intelligence Centre, the Defence Forces
Technical Research Centre and the Defence Forces Logistics Establishment.
The �ational Defence �niversity organises the Defence Forces’ international
courses.

Despite the reorganisation, the Defence Forces will retain their presence
in different parts of the country. Cooperation with the authorities and the
continuance of voluntary defence activities during the reform will be ensured
through military units and the network of regional of�ces. The regional
of�ces are part of Army units and are subordinate to the Army Command in
administrative matters.

The Government continues to assess the handling of military command matters.

###### 5.4 Creating and maintaining the defence capability

The basic structure of defence encompasses suf�cient and competent
personnel, a suf�cient amount of suitable and modern material, appropriate
infrastructure and security of supply.

###### Personnel and their competence

The goal of human resources management is to secure professional, competent
and motivated personnel for the Defence Forces. In ���5 the peacetime
strength of the Defence Forces will be approximately �� ��� persons.

The defence solution requires that wartime units have enough �t and able
professional military personnel serving as wartime leaders, as leaders of
technologically advanced weapon and command systems and as maintenance
experts. The viability of the military pension system will be ensured in such a
manner that regular personnel can end their active service at the correct time
from the perspective of a leadership reserve, and so that their time of service
supports the creation of the reserve.

The defence establishment must be able to handle the development of special
features related to the status, skills requirements and abilities of personnel.
These include the obligation to transfer to another post, the military pension
system as well as a person’s mental state and physical �tness.

Personnel transfers and moves to new locations will temporarily increase during
the implementation of the Defence Forces Reform and the duties of personnel

108


-----

are being altered in a fashion that promotes performance. The obligation to
transfer to another post will require supportive action in the future as well.

International assignments are a positive thing from the perspective of defence
performance, personal expertise and an individual’s career advancement. The
development of support services and other similar services provided during
and after assignments to military crisis management missions will continue.

The viability of general conscription will be improved by guaranteeing the
preconditions of training units. Each training platoon will have �.5 instructors
on average.

The different sectors of society must tackle and prevent the causes of military
service interruptions as well as try to in�uence the education and well�being
of persons who have not completed military service. The call�up system will
be developed by intensifying cooperation between the Defence Forces and the
other authorities.

The conscripts’ economic, societal and social status will be enhanced so as to
improve their motivation to serve in the military and guarantee the viability of
general conscription. Special attention will be paid to giving credits for military
service as regards studies and different tasks of society. �et another goal is
to better utilise the conscripts’ civilian skills. The development of conscription
will continue on the basis of the recommendations included in the ���� report
titled ‘Finnish conscription’.

The reserves are an indispensable asset to wartime units. Critical tasks in the
Defence Forces’ crisis organisation and the proper use of the reservists’ skills
in the Defence Forces’ different tasks are highlighted in the development of
the role of the reserve.

Individual and unit�level training and exercises are a central part of creating
and maintaining capability. In order to ensure adequate skills for the key troops
and units, suf�cient �eld exercises, �avy vessels’ sea days and �ight hours that
meet the training requirements must be guaranteed. This is also essential
from the standpoint of health and safety. As of ���5, in line with the Defence
Forces Reform, the number of refresher exercises will be returned to the level
that meets the demands of emergency conditions. The goal is to annually train
approximately �� ��� reservists, which will proportionally represent the level
that existed before the Defence Forces Reform.

109


-----

Voluntary defence supports the preservation of a capable reserve and the
readiness to assist other authorities. Voluntary defence activities are developed
to better serve the needs of the Defence Forces. The know�how of voluntary
defence organisations and the reserve will be utilised in regional troop planning.

General national defence instruction will be conducted on �ational Defence
Courses and Provincial Defence Courses, Advanced and Continuing Education
Courses, and Special Courses on �ational Defence. The instruction is carried
out within the framework of comprehensive security development. �ational
defence courses are conducted by the Defence Forces and the provincial
defence courses by the civilian authorities with the support of the Defence
Forces. The Defence Forces Reform and the regional administration reform will
take into account the continuity of provincial defence courses.

The will to defend the country remains the cornerstone of defence. The defence
will is also vitally important to society’s crisis resilience. Among other things
the will to defend the country can be safeguarded by high�quality conscript
and reservist training, improving the viability of general conscription, creating
regional troops, and supporting voluntary defence activities.

###### Materiel

Investments in materiel constitute an important element in the maintenance
and development of capabilities. Approximately one third of military defence
appropriations is allocated to material readiness.

In addition to shrinking resources and ageing materiel the following factors are
particularly in�uential in material policy decisions: requirements for capabilities
and cost�effectiveness, rising life cycle costs, military security of supply as well
as E� legislation on defence and security�related acquisitions. The structures
of military security of supply must be developed while taking into account
domestic and foreign actors. The defence establishment will actively develop
domestic and international cooperation in development of capability and
security of supply between the authorities and the business community.

The ability of the domestic defence and security industry to integrate, maintain,
further develop, service, repair and decommission the Defence Forces’ critical
materiel will be maintained and developed from the perspective of military
security of supply. The role of the industry will be assessed vis���vis strategic
competences and critical technologies. As a rule, support for critical systems
must be available in Finland. The defence industry’s export efforts and
internationalisation are actively sponsored.

110


-----

The rationale for retaining a substantial domestic gunpowder and ordnance
manufacturing capability is continually reassessed. For the time being, domestic
manufacturing has been justi�ed because of security of supply�considerations.

A strategic partner can be responsible for the maintenance and life cycle
management of critical materiel. The possibilities of new partnership
arrangements are being studied in areas outside the Defence Forces’ core
competences.

The life cycle of the Defence Forces’ existing materiel will be exploited to its
maximum. Multilateral and bilateral cooperation will be used in procurements.
The main focus is on operationally mature and tested products. The acquisition
of surplus materiel from abroad is seen as one instrument in procurements. In
order to sustain the competence and capacity of the critical domestic defence
industry, technological research and development will mainly be commissioned
from domestic sources.

International defence materiel cooperation is implemented within �ordic
cooperation, the development of the European defence market, �AT�’s
partnership cooperation and bilateral cooperation. International defence
materiel cooperation is a precondition for cost�effective acquisitions,
international material compatibility, the capability to receive foreign assistance,
securing the military security of supply and the Defence Forces’ ability to
participate in international crisis management operations. �ordic defence
materiel cooperation is to be intensi�ed. Its objective is to more concretely
plan, prepare and implement, in particular, common development projects
as well as common acquisitions and logistics. The prospects for common
procurements are actively being evaluated. Interoperability and compatibility
as per �AT� standards is a goal in procurements.

###### Infrastructure and the environment

The Defence Forces’ real estate mass will be developed from the national
defence perspective. It must meet the requirements of technological progress
and it will be integrated into the overall structure of society through land
use planning. The network of garrisons is maintained at the level required
by peacetime training and wartime functions. Following the changes in the
Defence Forces’ activities and those caused by the reform unneeded areas and
structures will, if possible, be relinquished as entities. An evaluation into the
entirety of the defence establishment’s premises will be completed by the end
of ����. This should facilitate a more cost�effective use of the premises.

111


-----

The needs of national defence are taken into account in land use planning in
accordance with the use purposes of the defence establishment’s real estate
nationwide.

The points of departure as regards the environment are sustainable
development, responsibility over the adverse effects of activities, and the
efforts to prevent them. There are special features in military activities that
differ from civilian activities. These must be taken into account in the review of
real estate planning and environmental legislation.

###### 5.5 Resources for defence development

The maintenance of a defence capability built on long�term planning and
development requires guidelines from the state leadership that extend
beyond several Government terms. Despite the economic uncertainty our
defence capability must continue to meet the requirements of the operating
environment. The political guidelines related to maintenance and development
must take into account the capabilities’ entire life cycle. Hence, capability
planning must extend all the way to the ����s.

The keystones of defence development include the defence of the entire
territory of the nation as well as the preservation of general conscription and
military non�alignment.

The maintenance and development of the defence capability requires a
balanced approach between appropriations to materiel readiness, operational
expenses and �xed personnel expenses. Since the price of defence materiel
increases more rapidly than other activities, it profoundly impacts the resources
allocated to military defence. At the same time, the other costs will continue
to rise as well. The assessment of appropriations must take into consideration
that a materially suf�cient defence capability also requires a satisfactory level
in terms of Euros.

The development guidelines with regard to timetables and volumes, given in
the ���� Government Report, will not materialise as planned. This is because
most of the cuts in appropriations had to be targeted on the maintenance and
development of capabilities, and on day�to�day activities.

Considering the requirements in the maintenance and development of
capabilities in the ����s an imbalance is about to emerge between the desired
end state of defence and the available resources, as described in this Report.

112


-----

Consequently, the Defence Forces’ ability to carry out their tasks may fall short
of the required level. It is important to prepare for the key challenges to the
defence capability already during the ongoing decade. �therwise, at the onset
of the ����s the defence capability will no longer meet the requirements of the
Defence Forces’ tasks and the operating environment.

In the short term �approximately �ve years� the Defence Forces Reform will
balance the cost structure and lay the foundation for future development.

In the medium term, by the beginning of the ����s a substantial share of the
critical material for all services’ most important troops will become obsolete,
degrading their capability below the required level. In practice, the materiel
investment level of ���5 requires strong prioritisation: it will only enable the
maintenance of a small share of the troops’ capabilities.

In the long term, by the mid�����s the maintenance of maritime defence
capabilities, and by the late ����s the maintenance of air defence capabilities,
will become extremely challenging. The guidelines for replacing and �nancing
these assets must already be adopted during the next Government’s term
of of�ce. Furthermore, the creation and maintenance of capabilities required
by future threats must also be secured �cyber, electronic warfare, long�range
standoff �repower, mobility�.

The sustainable maintenance of the selected defence solutions requires a
suf�cient level of investments in materiel. The defence establishment estimates
that the required increase, which focuses mainly on the maintenance of
capabilities, of military defence appropriations will come to approximately E�R
5� million in ����, in addition to index adjustments, and, gradually, to E�R
�5� million by ����, in addition to index adjustments. Closing the sustainability
gap of public �nances called for spending cuts of a permanent nature in Prime
Minister �yrki �atainen’s Government Programme and the decision on spending
limits in the spring of ����. Due to the worsening economic situation and
growing uncertainties, it is not possible to change the future spending limits in
advance. It will be the task of the next Government to consider the possibilities
of providing added resources to the Defence Forces, including their possible
impact on the present defence solution.
