**On the Publication of Defense of Japan 2023**

HAMADA Yasukazu
Minister of Defense

The world is at a turning point in history. The international community is facing its greatest
trial since World War II (WWII), and we have entered a new era of crisis.

Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is an unprecedented situation. A permanent member of
the United Nations Security Council has shown disregard for international law by launching
an aggression against a sovereign country and repeating rhetoric and actions that can be
interpreted as threats of nuclear weapons use. Additionally, China is rapidly enhancing its
military capability qualitatively and quantitatively, including nuclear and missile forces, while
continuing and amplifying its unilateral changes to the status quo by force and such attempts
in the East China Sea and the South China Sea. Furthermore, North Korea is rapidly advancing
its nuclear and missile development, repeatedly launching missiles.

Under these circumstances, it goes without saying that diplomatic efforts are the foremost
priority of Japan, which has experienced WWII and has since been pursuing the path of a
peace-loving nation. Japan remains unwavering in its commitment to respecting the rule of
law and settling any disputes not through the use of forcible measures but peacefully and
diplomatically. At the same time, in order to protect the lives and livelihood of Japanese
nationals, it is essential to make efforts to “defend our country by ourselves” and increase
deterrence. In other words, we need to make the opponent think that “attacking Japan will not
achieve its goals.”

Japan’s intentions and tangible measures for achieving them are articulated in our new
National Security Strategy, National Defense Strategy, and Defense Buildup Program that
were adopted by the Cabinet last December. The Ministry of Defense (MOD) will follow

through on them, including reinforcement of our defense production and technology bases.
In doing so, we will focus on two priorities: first, to maximize effective use of our current
equipment by improving operational rates, securing sufficient munitions, and accelerating
investments in improving the resiliency of major defense facilities; and second, to strengthen
the core areas of our future defense capabilities, including stand-off defense capabilities that
can be utilized as counterstrike capabilities and unmanned assets.

However, no matter how much advanced equipment the MOD/Self-Defense Forces (SDF)
procure, our defense capability cannot be demonstrated without personnel to operate them.
The core element of defense capability is SDF personnel. We will speed up our efforts to
improve their lives, work environments and treatment.

In recent years, diplomatic efforts have also gained importance for defense. Since my
appointment as Minister of Defense, I have held discussions on numerous occasions with
defense ministers, including Secretary of Defense Austin of the United States, Japan’s only
ally, and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Marles of Australia, working to
deepen our cooperation and collaboration. Building upon these discussions, we will continue
to pursue various cooperation, including the joint development of the next-generation fighter
aircraft by Japan, the United Kingdom, and Italy.

Even if my counterparts and I were to have different views, it is important to make persistent
efforts to maintain and increase our communication through dialogue, aiming to build trust
and avoid unforeseen circumstances. As such, I will continue to make these endeavors.

From this perspective, Defense of Japan 2023 outlines the security environment surrounding
Japan and the activities and efforts of the MOD/SDF. The beginning focuses on the changes
before 2013 (when the previous National Security Strategy was formulated) and the changes
through 2022 (when the current National Security Strategy was formulated), which includes a
special feature titled, “An Era of Upheavals: 10 Years of Change.” Additionally, the National
Defense Strategy is explained concisely and clearly with photos and diagrams to deepen
readers’ understanding.

It is important above all that initiatives for defense of Japan have the understanding and
cooperation of the people and are highly transparent to the international community. In this
regard, this white paper has played a critical role. We sincerely hope that Defense of Japan
2023 will be read by as many people as possible and help increase their understanding of the
activities and efforts of the MOD/SDF.

Japan’s defense capabilities are the ultimate guarantor of national security and demonstrate Japan’s resolve and capability to defend itself. Defense
capabilities cannot be replaced by any other means. The SDF play a central role as the “last stronghold.” Japan has consistently committed to modest and
efficient development of defense capabilities since the end of World War II.

Squarely facing the reality of the increasingly severe security environment, Japan decided to build truly effective defense capabilities under the 2013
National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG) and the 2018 NDPG, and has strengthened our defense capabilities as well as resolutely defended the lives
of Japanese nationals and their peaceful livelihoods as well as Japan’s territorial land, waters and airspace. However, Japan’s neighboring countries and
others are increasing their military activities while strengthening their military capabilities. With regard to future defense capabilities, Japan must clearly
demonstrate its intention to never tolerate any unilateral changes to the status quo by force and such attempts at any point in time.

Japan faces the most severe and complex security environment since the end of WWII. Japan needs to squarely face the grim reality and
fundamentally reinforce its defense capabilities, with a focus on the capabilities of its opponents and new ways of warfarefundamentally reinforce its defense capabilities, with a focus on the capabilities of its opponents and new ways of warfare, in order to protect

Based on this recognition, the Government of Japan finalized the NDS to comprehensively present Japan’s defense objectives, approaches

and means to accomplish those objectives, and the means to achieve them. The NDS replaces the NDPG, which was formulated six times since
1976. 1976. The NDS represents a major turning point for postwar defense policy and provides the direction and content for strengthening defense

capabilities over the mid-term to long term.capabilities over the mid-term to long term. The Government will make every effort to deepen the public’s understanding of the significance of

this major turning point.

**Defense Challenges**

The military background for Russia’s aggression against Ukraine was that Ukraine did not possess sufficient capabilities to deter Russia’s aggression.
Also worth paying attention to in this event is that a country with strong military capability has one day come to possess the intention to
launch an aggression. A threat materializes when the capability to inflict harm is combined with the intention to do so; accurately gauging other’s
intent from outside is inherently difficult. When a state’s decision-making process is opaque, there always exists conditions under which threats
may materialize.
To protect one’s country from such states, it is necessary to possess deterrence capability that makes others realize the difficulty of making
unilateral changes to the status quo by force, as well as to develop defense capability that are focused on opponent capabilities.
In addition, whether Japan will be able to respond to these emerging new ways of warfare is a major challenge in building future defense
capabilities. Japan’s future security and defense policy will directly affect the peace and stability of the region and the international community.

**Seven Fields of the Fundamental Reinforcement of Defense Capabilities**

Japan will work to fundamentally reinforce our defense capabilities by emphasizing seven pillars as the necessary functions and capabilities for
national defense. In particular, the top priorities for the next five years are to improve equipment operational rates, secure sufficient ammunition
and fuel, and expedite investment in key defense facilities in order to effectively maximize the use of current equipment, as well as to reinforce
future core capabilities such as stand-off defense capabilities and unmanned defense capabilities.

**Reinforcing Defense Production and Technology Bases**

The rapid progress of science and technology has fundamentally changed the nature of security, and various foreign countries are now working
to surround themselves with such technology.
In order to ensure stable procurement of equipment, it is essential to maintain and strengthen the defense production and technology
bases in Japan as a virtually integral part of its defense capabilities.

**Overview** **Chapter 1**

**International Community is Facing the Greatest Post-War Trial Yet International Community is Facing the Greatest Post-War Trial Yet **

States that do not share universal values nor political and economic systems based on these values are expanding their influence, and unilateral changes to the status quo

by force and such attempts, including Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, represent a serious challenge to the existing international order. The international community

is facing the greatest post-war trial yet, and has entered a new era of crisis. In addition, changes to the power

balance have brought about interstate competition across the political, economy, military, and other spheres,

and the competition between the United States and China is growing particularly intense. The international

community is presented with greater difficulties to rally together in taking on common challenges.

Furthermore, rapid development in science and technology are fundamentally changing the paradigm

of security. Countries are striving to develop cutting-edge technologies that prove to become “game

changers” and that are resulted in fundamental changes to the way the military is organized as well as the

way warfare is prosecuted, and the security sphere is expanding into the economic sphere, encompassing

areas such as the competition for control over advanced technologies.

In addition, risks in cyber and other domains are becoming more serious. It is highly likely that

information warfare, including the dissemination of disinformation, will be conducted on a regular basis,

and that hybrid warfare combining military and non-military methods will be employed in an even more

sophisticated manner.

**The Security Situation Intensifies in the Indo-Pacific Region The Security Situation Intensifies in the Indo-Pacific Region **

The Indo-Pacific region in which Japan is situated faces a host of security challenges. In particular, the

number of arms including nuclear weapons and missiles is rapidly building up around Japan, and the

**Russian Aggression and Defense by Ukraine** **Chapter 2**

**Unilateral Changes to the Status Quo by Force Shake the Foundation**
**of the International Order, Including in Asia of the International Order, Including in Asia **

The Russian aggression against Ukraine undermines the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. It
is a serious violation of international law prohibiting the use of force and of the United Nations (UN) Charter.

Such unilateral changes to the status quo by force have shaken the very foundation of the international

order, including in Asia.
The situation in which a permanent member of the Security Council, which is supposed to take

primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security, openly engages in military actions

challenging international law and the international order, claims innocent lives, and repeatedly uses

language and actions that can be interpreted as threats involving nuclear weapons, is unprecedented.

While the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) estimates the
number of noncombatant victims in Ukraine may be over 8,000 as of April 2023, the actual number is

possibly much larger as accurate numbers cannot be determined due to the ongoing fighting, and the An apartment building in Zaporizhzhia destroyed by a Russian missile

number is likely still increasing now. If such Russian aggression is tolerated, it could send a message with March 5, 2023)

the wrong implication that unilateral changes to the status quo by force are acceptable in other regions as

well, including Asia. Therefore, the international community, including Japan, should never tolerate Russia’s action.
It is possible that Russian national strength will decline and the military balance between Russia and surrounding countries will change in the medium- and long-

term, because of significant casualties of conventional forces in this aggression. Furthermore, through Russia’s deepening cooperation with China and other factors,

this may have an impact on global affairs, including the development of the strategic competition between the United States and China and its impact on Asia. Therefore,

**New U.S. Strategy Places Emphasis on Alliances and Partnerships New U.S. Strategy Places Emphasis on Alliances and Partnerships **

The National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy released by the United States in October 2022 characterize China as a “pacing challenge,” Russia as an

“acute threat,” and North Korea as a “persistent threat.” In the Nuclear Posture Review released at the same time as the National Defense Strategy, it was noted that,

the United States will face two major nuclear powers by the 2030s

with China’s emergence as a major nuclear power.

In this context, the United States showed its recognition that

mutually-beneficial alliances and partnerships are a center of gravity

for its national defense strategy because it cannot meet these complex

and interconnected challenges alone. In particular, it states that it

will promote partnerships with allies and efforts to form multilateral

frameworks such as the Quad and AUKUS to counter China’s coercive

behavior in the Indo-Pacific region. The United States also continues

to demonstrate its commitment to a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific”

through ongoing “Freedom of Navigation Operations” in the South

China Sea and the passage of U.S. Navy vessels through the Taiwan

Strait.

**China’s Intensification of Unilateral Change to the Status Quo by Force and Such Attempts China’s Intensification of Unilateral Change to the Status Quo by Force and Such Attempts **

China has been increasing its defense budget at a rapid pace for an extended period of time,

and supported by this, it has been extensively and rapidly enhancing its military capability in

a qualitative and quantitative manner, with focuses on its naval and air forces as well as its

nuclear and missile forces.

For example, it has been pointed out that China may possess 1,500 nuclear warheads

by 2035, and it is proceeding rapidly with the construction of its second indigenous aircraft
carrier, which has been noted to be equipped with an electromagnetic catapults systems, as

well as the development of a wide variety of unmanned aerial vehicles.

Backed by these tremendous military capabilities, China has been intensifying its activities
across the entire region surrounding Japan, including in the East China Sea, particularly the

area around the Senkaku Islands, the Sea of Japan, and the western Pacific Ocean including

Xi Jinping, currently in his third term as general secretary [EPA/Jiji]

areas around the Izu and Ogasawara Islands, extending beyond the so-called first island

chain to the second island chain. It is increasing military pressure on Taiwan and continues to

entrench its military foothold in the South China Sea.
Regarding Taiwan, in particular, China launched nine ballistic missiles in August 4, 2022,

five of which landed within Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). This was perceived as a

threat to local residents.

China’s current external stance, military activities, and other activities have become

a matter of serious concern for Japan and the international community, and present an
unprecedented and the greatest strategic challenge to which Japan should respond with its

comprehensive national power and in cooperation and collaboration with its ally, like-minded

countries and others.

China regards unification with Taiwan as “a natural requirement for realizing

the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,” and is highly wary of the United

States’ involvement in issues concerning Taiwan.

In 2022, then Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Pelosi and

other members from both parties of Congress visited Taiwan. Following this,

the Taiwan Enhanced Resilience Act to reinforce security cooperation with

Taiwan was passed, indicating that both the U.S. government and Congress

plan to further strengthen support for Taiwan.

Responding to this, China has further intensified military activities

around Taiwan.

**North Korea Makes Advances in Nuclear and Missile Development North Korea Makes Advances in Nuclear and Missile Development **

In recent years, North Korea has been repeatedly launching ballistic

missiles and other missiles at an unprecedentedly high frequency. It is also

concentrating on enhancing its nuclear and missile related technologies

and operational capabilities. For example, North Korea has repeatedly

launched ballistic missiles that fly with irregular trajectories and missiles

it calls “hypersonic missiles,” and it is also pursuing the implementation of

long-range cruise missiles with the intention of mounting them with tactical

nuclear weapons. In October 2022, it launched a ballistic missile that passed

over Japan, and it has also repeatedly launched ICBM-class missiles. Such

military activities pose an even more grave and imminent threat to Japan’s

national security than ever before and significantly undermine the peace,

stability and security of the region and international community.

**Russia Adopts the “Strong State” Model and Ramps Up Strategic Coordination with China Russia Adopts the “Strong State” Model and Ramps Up Strategic Coordination with China **

Russia has been developing and deploying a variety of new weapons under its “strong

state” model. Since the start of its aggression against Ukraine, it has also been making

moves to increase troop numbers and expand and reorganize its military units. Russia has
actively continued it’s military operations in the Far East even in the midst of its aggression

against Ukraine, and the “Vostok-2022” strategic command post exercise was conducted

with more than 50,000 troops and the participation of a total of 14 countries including China

and India. Russia has also been making moves to strengthen a strategic tie with China.

The repeated joint bomber flights and joint navigations of vessels by Russia and China are

clearly intended for demonstration of force against Japan and are of grave concern from the
perspective of the security of Japan and the region. We must continue to monitor actions

by the Russian military in the Indo-Pacific region, including Japan, with strong concern.

Science & technology, and the creation of innovation are sources of Japan’s economic

and social development. Appropriate use of these technologies is essential not only for

security, but also for addressing global-scale issues such as climate change. Countries

are making efforts for the research, development, and military applications of artificial

intelligence (AI), quantum technology, next generation information and communication

technology, and other advanced, potentially game-changing technologies that could

dramatically change the future character of warfare.

In addition, there is concern about information theft of advanced technologies

for military use by abusing cyberspace or corporate activities, including acquisitions

and investments. Countries are taking measures from the perspective of so-called

“economic security,” such as strengthening export controls and screening mechanisms

for foreign investments, as well as increasing the independence of technological

development and production.

**Basic Concepts of Japan’s Security and Defense** **Chapter 1**

**Defense Capabilities To Protect Japan’s Independence, Peace, and Security Defense Capabilities To Protect Japan’s Independence, Peace, and Security **
Peace and security are essential for Japanese people to live with a sense of safety and for Japan to continue to prosper, but these cannot be secured by simply wishing
for them.
What we must prioritize first and foremost is developing proactive diplomacy to protect the lives and livelihood of Japanese nationals. It is essential to promote
multilateral cooperation with like-minded countries through the Japan-U.S. Alliance as a cornerstone. At
the same time, diplomacy needs to be backed by defense capabilities. As its strategic approach, Japan will
fundamentally reinforce its defense capabilities, including counterstrike capabilities, while developing its
diplomacy under the vision of a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific.” Moreover, from the perspective of preventing
the emergence of threats to Japan, the importance of the role played by defense capabilities in cooperative
efforts in the Indo-Pacific region is increasing.
Recognizing the role of such defense capabilities, Japan will ensure its peace and security by exerting

**Creating a Defense Architecture That Can Surely Protect the People Creating a Defense Architecture That Can Surely Protect the People **
We are currently living in an era where the world order is facing grave challenges, and confrontation and cooperation are intricately interwined. Moreover, Japan has
entered a new era of crisis, facing its most severe and complex security environment since WWII. To respond to this severe security environment, Japan formulated
the National Security Strategy of Japan (NSS), the National Defense Strategy of Japan (NDS), and the Defense Buildup Program (DBP) in December 2022. These are
thought to mark a major turning point in Japan’s postwar defense policy, enabling the fundamental reinforcement of necessary defense capabilities and creating a
defense architecture that can truly protect the people.
The NSS is positioned as Japan’s supreme national security policy document. It outlines the Government’s strategy to respond with a whole-of-government
approach in a wide range of areas including economic security, technology, and intelligence, in addition to the traditional areas of diplomacy and defense. In particular,
in FY2027, Japan will take the necessary measures to ensure that the budget level for both the fundamental reinforcement of defense capabilities and complementary
initiatives reaches 2% of the GDP in FY2022 (approximately 11 trillion yen), in order to reinforce Japan’s own architecture for national defense.
The NDS outlines Japan’s defense objectives and its approaches and means by which Japan accomplishes those objectives. In order to defend the lives and
peaceful livelihood of Japanese nationals amid the most severe and complex security environment since the end of WWII, Japan needs to squarely face the grim reality
and fundamentally reinforce its defense capabilities, with a focus on opponent capabilities and new ways of warfare (massive missile attacks; hybrid warfare, including
information warfare; asymmetrical warfare leveraging the domains of space, cyber and electromagnetic spectrum and with unmanned aerial vehicles and other assets;
threats using nuclear weapons, etc.). To this end, the NDS establishes a policy for the fundamental reinforcement of defense capabilities, including the possession of
counterstrike capabilities.
As for the functions and capabilities required for defense, Japan will first strengthen its (i) stand-off defense capabilities and (ii) integrated air and missile defense
capabilities, in order to disrupt and defeat invading forces from a long distance, thereby deterring an invasion of Japan itself. Should deterrence fail, in addition to capabilities
(i) and (ii), Japan will strengthen its (iii)
unmanned defense capabilities, (iv)

the status quo by force occur are hard to predict, Japan will strengthen its defense capabilities by FY2027, in five years, to the point Japan will be able to take primary
responsibility for countering any invasion of Japan that occurs and disrupt and defeat the invasion while receiving support from its ally and others. In addition, further
efforts will be made by approximately ten years from now to better ensure these defense objectives are met, and to reinforce Japan’s defense capabilities so that any
invasion of Japan can be disrupted and defeated earlier and at places further afield.
In addition, Japan will also reinforce its defense production and technology bases as virtually integral part of a defense capability, as well as the foundation for SDF
personnel, who are at the core of defense capability, to demonstrate their abilities.
The DBP indicates the level of defense capability Japan should possess, including what needs to be done to reach that level. It describes various measures to
realize the fundamental reinforcement of defense capabilities at a budget of approximately 43 trillion yen for the next five years, which is on a completely different
level from the past. In particular, Japan will work to fundamentally reinforce areas at the core of its future defense capabilities, such as stand-off defense capabilities
and unmanned defense capabilities; improve operational rates, secure ammunition, and accelerate investment in fortifying key defense facilities to maximize the use
of existing equipment; and further reinforce defense production and technology bases and the human resource base.

**Budget for the “First Year” of Fundamentally Reinforcing Defense Capabilities Budget for the “First Year” of Fundamentally Reinforcing Defense Capabilities **
Regarding defense-related expenditures for FY2023, the MOD has secured a budget appropriate for the content of the first year of the “buildup program” (budget for
the “first year” of fundamentally reinforcing defense capabilities), which will build up the initiatives necessary to fundamentally reinforce defense capabilities within
five years.
The annual budget expenditure includes ¥6,600.1 billion (year-on-year increase of ¥1,421.3 billion (27.4%)) allocated for DBP-related expenditures, an amount
that rises to ¥6,821.9 billion when U.S. Force realignment-related expenses are included, with the “substantial increase of the defense budget” having been secured.

Japan must deter, through cooperation and collaboration with its ally, like-minded countries and others, unilateral

changes to the status quo by force and such attempts that concern Japan’s peace and security. In order to influence

an opponent’s actions, it is necessary to improve and enhance training and exercises such as Flexible Deterrent

**Responses to Invasions of Japan, Including Missile Attacks Responses to Invasions of Japan, Including Missile Attacks **

In response to an invasion against Japan, including our remote islands, Japan would disrupt and defeat the invading

that organically integrate capabilities in the ground, maritime, and air domains, as well as in the domains of space,

cyber, and electromagnetic spectrum to secure asymmetrical superiority, and disrupt and defeat the invading forces.

Japan would also continue persistent actions to crush the opponent’s will to invade.

Moreover, in response to an invasion of Japan, including missile attacks, Japan will intercept missiles flying over

the high seas and our territorial airspace with its missile defense system. In addition, as a measure for self-defense

to the minimum required level to prevent invasion, including missile attacks, Japan will utilize capabilities including

stand-off defense capabilities to enable itself to conduct effective counterstrikes in the opponent’s territory, and

Large-scale terrorist attacks and attacks against critical infrastructure including

nuclear power plants are also serious threats. The MOD/SDF will take effective measures in

the event of such attacks in close cooperation with relevant organizations. In addition, when

an invasion of Japan is predicted, the MOD/SDF will utilize mobile deployment capabilities

to facilitate initiatives for civil protection, including evacuation guidance for residents.

**Responses to Invasions of Japan,**
**Including Responses to Information Warfare Including Responses to Information Warfare **

As military activities around Japan become more active, while striving to gather information

quickly and accurately through various means on a regular basis, the MOD/SDF is reinforcing

functions such as information gathering and analysis.

In the international community, emphasis is being placed on information warfare,

a method of warfare that uses the spread of disinformation and strategic information to Personnel participating in civil protection training

influence public opinion and decision-making in other countries while creating a security

environment favorable to one’s own country, even when a conflict has not yet erupted. In light of this situation, the MOD/SDF, from the perspective of the defense of

Japan, will build a system and posture that can reliably handle integrated information warfare with special regard to the cognitive dimension, with a focus on fact-

checking and analyzing disinformation and promptly and appropriately disseminating information.

**Sustainability and Resiliency Enhancement Initiatives**
**to Ensure Warfare Sustainability to Ensure Warfare Sustainability **

In order to defend Japan in the future, the current warfighting sustainability of the SDF is not

necessarily sufficient in the form of ammunitions and fuel, and the number of operationally

available equipment. It is necessary to squarely address these realities and strive to ensure

and maintain sufficient warfare sustainability so that the SDF can continue persistent

activities in contingencies, which serves as an effective deterrent. To this end, the MOD/

SDF will urgently possess adequate ammunition as necessary, build up ammunition storage

facilities and fuel tanks, and improve equipment availability. In addition, major command

headquarters will be moved underground and structurally reinforced, and other facilities

**Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements as a Cornerstone for Japan’s Security Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements as a Cornerstone for Japan’s Security **

The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements based on the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty,

together with Japan’s own national defense architecture, constitute a cornerstone

for Japan’s national security. Japan has maintained its peace, security, and

independence centered on the Security Arrangements with the world’s dominant

military power, the United States, with which it shares basic values such as

democracy, respect for human rights, the rule of law, and a capitalist economy as

well as interests in maintaining the peace and security of the world and has strong

economic ties.

The NDS calls for further deepening of discussions with the United States

on both countries’ respective roles, missions, and capabilities to further reinforce

Japan-U.S. joint deterrence capabilities in an integrated manner from the

perspective of deterring invasion against Japan. Specifically, Japan will further

deepen cooperation with the United States to smoothly implement allied cross-

domain operations of the Alliance, including in the domains of space, cyber, and Japan-U.S. Defense Ministerial Meeting (January 2023)

electromagnetic spectrum, and to improve interoperability. Furthermore, Japan will

reinforce collaboration in such areas as air defense, anti-surface warfare; anti-

submarine warfare; mine warfare; amphibious operations; airborne operations;

intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and targeting (ISRT); protection of assets

and facilities; and logistics support. In order to effectively realize the division of

roles and missions between Japan and the United States in light of the fundamental

reinforcement of Japan’s defense capabilities, Japan will ensure close operational

coordination with the United States through Japan-U.S. bilateral planning. In

addition, Japan will work to improve response capability of the Alliance, including

readiness and interoperability of the Alliance, through more advanced and practical

exercises and training. In order to ensure that the United States extended deterrence

with nuclear deterrence at its core remains credible and resilient, Japan will further

actively engage in and deepen bilateral discussions on extended deterrence,

including those at the ministerial level. To deter unilateral changes to the status

quo by force and such attempts, as well as to deter various contingencies from

emerging, Japan will further expand and evolve operations including joint flexible

deterrent options (FDO) and joint intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
(ISR) activities as a part of routine bilateral efforts by Japan and the United States

on a regular basis.

In addition, while the presence of U.S. Forces in Japan (USFJ) functions as

deterrence, it is necessary to make efforts appropriate for the actual situation of

each area in order to mitigate the impacts of the stationing of the USFJ on the
living environment of the local residents. In particular, the realignment of the USFJ

is a very important initiative for mitigation of the impact on local communities,

including those in Okinawa, and maintaining the deterrance capability of the U.S.

Forces. Therefore, the MOD will advance the realignment and other initiatives and

make continuous efforts to gain the understanding and cooperation of the local

**Technology Bases Technology Bases **

Science and technology are rapidly advancing, and countries are developing cutting-

edge technologies that could become so-called “game changers” which dramatically

alter the future character of warfare. In addition, the development of new technologies

such as artificial intelligence (AI) has expanded the character of warfare not only in the

ground, maritime, and air domains, but also in the space, cyberspace, and electromagnetic

domains, including the cognitive dimension. In response to these changes, each country

is actively engaged in research and development to ensure its technological superiority.

On the other hand, Japan’s defense production and technology bases have been exposed

to challenging conditions resulting from growing issues such as supply chain risks and a Next-generation fighter aircraft to be jointly developed by Japan, the United Kingdom,

Japan’s defense production and technology bases are essential infrastructure for securing

the stable research and development, production, and procurement of equipment in Japan

and for incorporating the cutting-edge technologies necessary for new ways of warfare

into its defense equipment, making these bases virtually defense capability itself, and that

efforts will be made to reinforce these bases.

In addition, in order to acquire the necessary equipment for new ways of warfare, it

is imperative for Japan to leverage the technology that it possesses. The development

of scientific technologies and innovations based on Japan’s advanced technological

capabilities is at the source of its economic and social development and constitutes a key

element of its comprehensive national power integral to its national security. In addition,

actively utilizing technological capabilities developed by Japan’s public and private sectors

essential activity for strengthening Japan’s architecture for national defense. It is important

to work strategically to ensure technological superiority as a nation by actively leveraging

the results of research and development in science and technology in Japan’s public and
private sectors for the research and development of defense equipment. Therefore, it is

necessary to further promote research and development domestically and develop and

strengthen the technology base for the technology areas on which Japan should focus.

Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology, its Implementation Guidelines, and other

systems are to be considered for revisions in order to promote smooth transfer of defense

equipment and technology of high security significance and international joint development

in a broad array of fields. In addition, Japan will carry forward with the transfer of defense

equipment and technology in the joint public and private efforts by establishing a fund, and

implementing measures including providing corporate assistance as necessary to smoothly

promote such transfers

Despite a severe recruitment environment with a declining number of

people eligible for recruitment due to a declining birthrate, the MOD/SDF is

working on recruitment activities and also reinforcing mid-career recruitment

to utilize human resources from the private sector in order to ensure stable

recruitment of excellent human resources. Regarding SDF Reserve Personnel

To this end, the MOD/SDF is adopting working style reforms to correct

working long hours and measures such as teleworking to make work hours

and locations more flexible.

In addition, the MOD/SDF is working to promote the participation of

highly motivated and capable women, such as by lifting restrictions on the
assignment of female SDF personnel.

For the SDF to respond to the increasingly severe strategic environment, strategic and

**Measures Relating to Training and Exercises** **Chapter 3**

In order to fulfill its challenging mission of defending Japan, the SDF constantly conducts joint exercises and training by the GSDF, MSDF, and ASDF services. The

content of these trainings is not limited to conventional domains, but extends into new domains, including that of space, cyber and electromagnetic spectrum. Efforts

are being made to improve cross-domain operations in order to better utilize these domains and enhance defense capabilities.

In addition, in order to reinforce the deterrence and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S. Alliance, each service of the SDF conducts bilateral trainings with the

corresponding U.S. military service and Japan-U.S. bilateral joint exercises, the contents of which have been deepened year after year.

Furthermore, in order to strategically promote multi-faceted and multi-layered defense cooperation based on the vision of a Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP), the

SDF is actively engaged in bilateral training and exercises with ally and like-minded countries and others in the wider Indo-Pacific region.
Moreover, in recent years, the SDF actively promotes bilateral training and exercises not only with coastal states in the Indo-Pacific region, but also with like-

minded countries and others outside the region, with a view to improving interoperability and deepening ties with these countries.

**DIGEST**

In order to protect Japan’s peace and independence in an increasingly severe security environment, the SDF must become more powerful on its own while

improving its ability to cooperate and collaborate with Japan’s ally and like-minded countries and others, rather than be content with its current capabilities. For this

reason, the SDF is striving to acquire further deterrence and response capabilities through training and exercises.

Japan. The MOD/SDF has long complied with environmental laws and regulations and has

made efforts to thoroughly conserve the environment and reduce environmental impact.
In August 2022, the MOD/SDF formulated the Ministry of Defense Response Strategy on

Climate Change, which outlines strategic measures for the MOD to address climate change.

Going forward, the MOD will promote concrete measures to combat the impacts of climate

**KEY WORDS**

**“Grey Zone Situations” and “Hybrid Warfare”**

So-called “grey zone” situations simply represent a wide range of situations that are neither peacetime nor wartime.
In a grey-zone situation, for example, a country that confronts another over territory, sovereignty or maritime and other economic interests uses some forceful
organization to demonstrate its presence in the relevant disputed region in a bid to alter the status quo or force other countries to accept its assertions or demands.
The so-called “hybrid warfare” represents methods intentionally blurring the boundaries between the military and non-military realms, forcing affected actors to take
complex measures that are not limited to military actions. The means of hybrid warfare include operations using military units of unidentified nationality, cyberattacks
to affect communications and other critical infrastructure, the spread of false information through the internet and the media, and other influential operations. The
combination of these measures is considered as amounting to hybrid warfare. In hybrid warfare, a country takes measures that are difficult to identify definitively as
an “armed attack” based on its outward appearance. It is said that such an approach is taken with an intent to make it difficult for the target country to address the
situation, such as delaying the military’s initial response, while denying the attacker country’s own involvement.

more necessary to ensure security.
On the other hand, due to the changing power
balances and diversifying values around the world,
strong leadership is being lost in the global governance
structure at large. As a result, the international community


is presented with greater difficulties to rally together in
taking on common challenges such as climate change,
free trade, arms control, disarmament, non-proliferation,
terrorism, global health including measures against
infectious diseases, and food and energy issues.

**Security Environment in the Indo-Pacific Region**
**2**


The global security environment and challenges
articulated above are particularly prominent in the IndoPacific region, where Japan is situated, and its severity
may be on the rise in the future. The Indo-Pacific region
is the core of global vitality, home to more than half of
the world’s population. The dynamism of the intersection
of the Pacific and the Indian Oceans is a growth engine
for the global economy. Japan, situated in this region, is
well positioned to benefit from this. At the same time, the
Indo-Pacific region faces a host of security challenges.
For example, several nations and regions that possess
large military forces, including nuclear weapons, do
not share universal values, nor political and economic
systems based on such universal values. Furthermore,
there exists a complex intertwining of diplomatic and
other relations based on historical backgrounds. With
regard to Japan, territorial disputes over the Northern
Territories and Takeshima, both of which are inherent
parts of the territory of Japan, remain unresolved. In
addition, Japan faces threats and challenges of various


types and intensities, such as unilateral changes to the
status quo by force and such attempts in the East and
South China Seas and other areas, piracy, terrorism, the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and natural
disasters.
In the vicinity of Japan, military buildups, including
those of nuclear weapons and missiles, are rapidly
advancing, coupled with mounting pressures from
unilateral changes to the status quo by force. Moreover,
**grey zone situations over territories, cross-border**
cyberattacks on critical civilian infrastructures, and
information warfare through the spread of disinformation,
are constantly taking place, thereby further blurring
the boundary between contingency and peacetime.
Furthermore, the scope of national security has expanded
to include fields previously considered non-military such
as economic, technological, and others, and thus the
boundary between military and non-military fields is no
longer clear-cut either.

**(2) Start of Ukrainian Counteroffensive**
After repelling the Russian attack on large cities such
as Kyiv and Kharkiv, the Ukrainian military kept fierce
resistance to the AFRF along the entire front line as
well as intensified its attacks on Russian positions from
April 2022, which seemed to be prepared for the future
counteroffensive.
In mid-May of the same year, the AFU reportedly
regained some areas around Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine.
The Ukrainian military reportedly sank a Slava-class
guided missile cruiser “Moskva”, the flagship of Black
Sea Fleet of the Russian Navy, by a domestically produced
surface-to-ship cruise missile “Neptune” on April 13 of
the same year in southern Ukraine where Russian forces
achieved relatively considerable successes. On June 30,
2022, General Zaluzhnyi, Commander-in-Chief of the
AFU, announced that the AFU attacked AFRF units on
Zmiinyi (Snake) Island in the Black Sea, occupied in
the early stages of the war, and forced them to withdraw
from the island.
These Ukrainian attacks degraded the Russian air
defense network that had been provided by the vessels
of the Russian Black Sea Fleet in southern Ukraine,
which made it difficult for Russian Air Forces to conduct
operations in the area, as a result of which made it easier
for Ukraine to launch counteroffensive in the region.
It can further be seen that the AFU used M142 High
Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), supplied by
the United States, in action from late June 2022. The AFU
announced an attack on fuel and ammunition depots in a
Russia’s base near Nova Kakhovka, Kherson oblast, on the
night on July 11, and mentioned starting a counteroffensive
in the south. The Ukrainian military effectively attacked
Russian command posts and logistics bases using a longrange precision strike weapons system such as HIMARS in
the region, and interdicted bridges and other crossing sites
over the Dnieper River. Difficulties in logistics had been
caused by these attacks decreased fighting capabilities
and morale of Russian troops to the north of the river and
improved conditions for the Ukrainian counteroffensive.
In August 2022, there were explosions in several AFRF
facilities including air bases in the Crimean Peninsula
in southern Ukraine which had been occupied by the
AFRF since 2014. While Ukraine does not officially
acknowledge involvement in these incidents, several
AFRF facilities for military air power and logistics have
been based on the peninsula since the start of Russia’s
aggression against Ukraine


made territorial gains in southern Ukraine adjacent to
the Crimean Peninsula, which was illegally “annexed”
by Russia in 2014, more quickly than in other areas. The
AFRF occupied Kherson, the capital city of Kherson
oblast on the western bank of the Dnieper River, in early
March 2022, and advanced further west in the direction
of Mykolaiv, the capital city of Mykolaiv oblast. It is
probable that the AFRF made territorial gain in the
northern Zaporizhzhia oblast and the southern Donetsk
oblast on the coast of the Sea of Azov, encircled an
industrial port city of Mariupol and attempted to seize
the city by indiscriminate bombarding on the area where
noncombatants remained.

Russian forces, which failed to take control of the capital
Kyiv, on March 25, 2022, announced that previous
military action had been at “the first phase of operation”
and that the primary goal of its operation would shift to
the “liberation” of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in
eastern Ukraine, that is, pursuing expanded territorial
gains in the regions.
It is said that after withdrawing its forces from the Kyiv
area and regrouping, the AFRF seized Sieverodonetsk,
the temporary capital city of Luhansk oblast, and its
surroundings from late June to early July of the same
year.
The AFRF concentrated its forces on seizing
Mariupol, Ukraine’s last stronghold in southern Donetsk
oblast on the coast of the Sea of Azov. On May 16, 2022,
AFU General Headquarters announced that it ordered all
commanders of Ukrainian units surrounded by Russian
troops at the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works in Mariupol
to give first priority to soldier’s lives. On May 20, the
Russian Ministry of Defense announced that Defense
Minister Shoigu reported to President Putin that the
AFRF completed the operation in Mariupol with the
surrender of Ukrainian units at the iron works.
As a result of the seizure of Mariupol, Russia secured
the whole coast of the Sea of Azov and land bridge
connecting to the Crimean Peninsula that made it easier
to make further territorial gains for the AFRF in southern
Ukraine.

**3 Full-fledged Ukraine Counteroffensive**
**and Russian Response**

**(1) Full-fledged Ukraine Counteroffensive**
In early September 2022, the Ukrainian military
conducted a successful counteroffensive in Kharkiv
oblast in eastern Ukraine, and regained most of the
Russian-occupied area in the oblast. It is probable that
the Ukraine military strived to conceal its plan and intent
for the counteroffensive in the east, unlike the south
where the counteroffensive was conspicuous. It is also
pointed out that the Russian troops in the east had become
vulnerable after redeployment of its troops to the south
to prepare for the expected Ukrainian counteroffensive,
which led to Ukraine’s successful counteroffensive in
the east.
On the other hand, in the south, as a result of efforts to
cut off and undermine each AFRF unit using the Dnieper
River, the AFU forced Russian troops to withdraw and
successfully regained the northern part of the Dnieper
of Kherson oblast including Kherson, the capital city of
the oblast, in mid-November 2022. It is seen that, since
then, the AFU and the AFRF have faced each other on
both sides of the Dnieper River, and the Russian military
continues bombardment and shelling of cities and towns
on the western bank of the Dnieper with multiple rockets
and artillery.
Furthermore, there was some damage inside the
Russian territory caused by an explosion and destruction
of a girder of the bridge connecting Krasnodar of Russia
and Crimean Peninsula of Ukraine in October 2022,
and reported in December, explosions and fires in
several Russian military facilities including air bases,
where long-range bombers that have been used to target
Ukraine are based


**(2) Russia’s Response**
Russia responded in various ways to Ukraine’s full-fledged
counteroffensive, such as with troop buildups and making
its occupation of Ukrainian territory a fait accompli.
In respect of buildup of forces, President Putin
signed executive orders related to partial mobilization
to replenish forces, as it is pointed out there were as
many as about 80,000 casualties as of early August
2022, explained the necessity of the actions, and asked
people for their support on September 21. On the same
day, Defense Minister Shoigu said that he was planning
to mobilize some 300,000 reservists. In other measures,
on September 30, an executive order was announced,
which simplifies procedures for foreign citizens to
acquire Russian nationality if they signed a contract to
join AFRF. It is pointed out that the decision was made
with former Soviet citizens in mind .
Regarding Russia’s fait accompli of the occupied areas
in Ukraine, Russia illegally “annexed” four regions of
the occupied areas in the oblasts of Luhansk Donetsk


-----

Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson in September 30, based on the
results of what they called a “referendum” conducted in
the area from September 23 to 27 to ask the people whether
their territory was to be “annexed” to Russia or not.
At the same time, the AFRF intensify bombardments
with missiles and loitering munitions all over Ukraine. It
is pointed out that this was aimed at depleting Ukraine’s
air defense missile reserves, as well as weakening war
sustainability and the fighting spirit of Ukrainian people
by damaging power grids critical for civilian life in cold
winter. While the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) estimates the
number of noncombatant victims caused by Russian attack
in Ukraine amount to be over 8,000 as of April 2023, the
actual number is possibly much larger as accurate numbers
cannot be determined due to the ongoing fighting, and the
number is likely still increasing now.
As May started, a private military company (PMC)
Wagner and some units of AFRF strengthened offensive
actions, and announced the Bakhmut city came under
complete Russian control.

back threats to territorial integrity of the nation in his
statement to people to promulgate an executive order
about partial mobilization on September 21, 2022. He
was clearly keeping nuclear weapons in mind in the
statement. Other high officials make similar statements
repeatedly as well.
Russia has repeatedly claimed that Ukraine may use
chemical and biological weapons. But the United States
and the United Kingdom evaluate it as showing that Russia
is preparing for the so-called “false flag campaign.”[1]

**5 Future Outlook and Effects on Military Balance**


**Part**
**Ⅰ**

**Chapter**


**(1) Future Outlook**
While there is no predicting about what may happen in
the future regarding Russia’s aggression against Ukraine,
there are many indications about strategy, tactics, and
human and material war sustainability of both the AFRF
and the AFU which may impact future developments.
Some difficulties in the chain of command of the
AFRF were indicated from the very early stages. It is
pointed out that, at the start of aggression, the AFRF
allocated the chain of command and assigned troops of
a Joint Strategic Command (Military District) to each
operational front as it is in peacetime, and did not have a
centralized command chain covering the entire projected
force consisting of mechanized infantry forces said to be
as many as 200,000-strong, and missile units belonging
to the Army, Navy, or Air Force, as well as sea power
and air power [2]. In early April 2022, a Joint Task Force
Commander was reportedly appointed to command all
actions of the AFRF. This is seen as a measure to improve
cooperation among services and theaters. Also, on
January 11, 2023, Russia announced that Army General
Gerasimov, Chief of the General Staff of the AFRF, was
named as the Joint Task Force Commander, aiming to
improve cooperation among services, the quality of
logistics support, and command efficiency of the unit.
The AFU continues fighting until today undauntedly
against the AFRF that has superior quality and larger
numbers. Continuation of fighting is made possible by
several factors such as a number of reservists with combat
experience derived from the eastern front campaign since
2014, significant progress in training non-commissioned
officers who assume leading roles in battle realized with


Russia repeatedly takes dangerous actions around
nuclear facilities in ongoing aggression against Ukraine.
Russia occupied the Chornobyl nuclear power plant
near the Belarusian border on February 24, 2022, and
also occupied the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant
in southeastern Ukraine on March 4 of the same year.
In addition, Russia attacked the Kharkiv Institute of
Physics and Technology (KIPT) multiple times on and
after March 6, which has experimental reactors and
handles nuclear substances.
On April 20, 2022, when the Russian military
conducted its first flight test of “Sarmat” the new
large intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in
development, President Putin made a statement showing
off his country’s nuclear force. Furthermore, President
Putin repeatedly mentioned nuclear weapons probably
with the intention of intimidation. For example, he
said Russia would use every possible means to bounce


On March 21, 2022, U.S. President Joe Biden made a statement to the effect that there are certain signs that President Putin is considering using biological and chemical weapons in Ukraine.

reorganization of the Defense Ministry and the AFU
aiming to achieve the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) standard, and the introduction of rapid and
highly accurate fire coordination systems based on
commercial off-the-shelf technologies.
For human war sustainability, it is pointed out that
the number of casualties was 180,000 for the AFRF,
and 100,000 for the AFU, both as of January 2023.[3] It is
said that the AFRF is supported in training for mobilized
soldiers by Belarus because it has deployed even units
taking on educational and training roles in peacetime.
The AFU is supported in education and training for new
recruits by Western countries.
It is pointed out that Russia’s war sustainability
for material has been undermined with hindered
equipment acquisition caused by economic sanctions
against the country. Even in this situation, the Russian
military maintains its power by various means such
as the munitions industry operating around the clock,
diverting missiles not for ground attacks, the acquisition
of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) made in Iran, and
taking over tanks from Belarus. Furthermore, it is pointed
out that Russia is capable of prolonged battle, even under
sanctions, because it has sufficient production capacities
for equipment including ammunition belonging in the
technical scope of the former Soviet Union.
The Ukrainian military, on the other hand, can acquire
only limited parts and ammunition from outside of Russia
because most of its equipment was made in the former
Soviet Union. Although there is some equipment that
can be repaired or acquired domestically, it is difficult
to carry out, because the major ammunition industrial
cities, such as Kharkiv and Dnipro, are within the attack
range of the AFRF. Therefore, support from foreign
countries is important in the acquisition of equipment
and ammunition as well as in education and training to
change over former Soviet Union equipment to western
equipment in order to maintain war sustainability.


It is seen that the AFU will continue the
counteroffensive with strong will to resist invaders.
However, it is pointed out that there is a possibility for
a prolonged battle, considering Russia’s attempt to build
up its strength through the partial mobilization.

**(2) Influence on Other Regions**
Although Russia has relied on military power in order to
persist in its opinion, it is possible that Russian national
strength will decline and the military balance between
Russia and surrounding countries will change in the
medium- and long-term, because of significant casualties
of conventional forces in this aggression. It is possible
that Russia will maintain and strengthen relationships
with the member states of the Collective Security Treaty
Organization (CSTO)[4] and Shanghai Cooperation
Organization (SCO)[5] as well as make much account of
nuclear power as a deterrent.
In Europe, Russia is seen to move to strengthen
further its military involvement with Belarus which is
a member state of CSTO. For example, both countries
agreed that equipment modification and deployment of
new equipment for the Armed Forces of Belarus (AFB)
can be conducted in order to make it possible for the
AFB to transport Russian nuclear weapons.[6]

While Belarus reportedly allows Russia to use its
territory and provides equipment, logistics support,
and education and training to the AFRF in Russia’s
aggression against Ukraine, it is pointed out that Minsk
is reluctant to enter the war.
In the Caucasus region, Nikol Pashinyan, the prime
minister of Armenia, which is a member state of CSTO,
stated in January 2023 that his government refuses to host
exercises for CSTO Peace Keeping Troops scheduled to
take place in Armenia in 2023. It is pointed out that this
refusal is because Armenia considers measures taken
by CSTO against the armed conflict at the border with
Azerbaijan in September 2022 to be inadequate.[7] In the

According to the remark of General Kristoffersen, Chief of Defense of Norway, on January 22, 2023.

CSTO is a military alliance consisting of six member states, namely Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Armenia. Article 4 of the 1992 Collective Security Treaty, which is the
grounds for establishing the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), states that, in the event of an act of aggression against any of the participating States, “all other participating States at
the request of this participating State shall immediately provide the latter with the necessary assistance, including military, and provide support by the means at their disposal in accordance with
the right to collective defense pursuant to article 51 of the UN Charter.”

President Putin stated that Russia could deliver Iskander-M surface-to-surface ballistic missiles that can be equipped with either a conventional warhead or a nonstrategic (tactical) warhead, and
could provide modifications to enable nuclear weapons to be loaded to Su-25 attacker jets of the Belarus Air Force in a meeting with President Lukashenko of Belarus on June 25, 2022.

Armenia expressed dissatisfaction about CSTO’s action at a CSTO summit meeting in November 2022, because when the country requested military support from CSTO for the conflict against
Azerbaijan in accordance with Article 4 of Collective Security Treaty on September 14, 2022, CSTO only dispatched observers. This conflict in September occurred at the Armenia-Azerbaijan border,

Middle East region adjacent to the Caucasus, it is seen
that Russia will strengthen its military cooperation with
Iran[8] and continue its military involvement with Syria as
a foothold in the eastern Mediterranean Sea.
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, which are
CSTO member states in the Central Asia region, do not
support Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.[9] In this way,
while Russia desires for CSTO to be maintained and
strengthened after it started the aggression against Ukraine,
the degree of cooperation of each member state is not clear.
In the Indo-Pacific region, Russia is deepening linkage
with China taking into consideration competition against
the United States.

**The Impact of Russia’s Aggression against Ukraine on International**
**3**
**Affairs and Various Countries’ Responses to It**


**1 General Situation**


While ground forces and air forces in the Eastern Military
District seem to be depleted from the actions of aggression
against Ukraine[10], it is seen that military action in Japanese
Northern Territories and Kuril Islands on the outer skirt
of the Sea of Okhotsk will be continued to defend the
maneuvering area for strategic missile submarines playing
a part of the AFRF’s strategic nuclear force. In addition, it
is seen that large sea and air power should remain in the Far
East region even after aggression against Ukraine, and it is
necessary to observe their action carefully.

See Chapter 3, Section 5-3-1 (Nuclear and Missile Forces);

Chapter 3, Section 5-4 (Russian Forces in Japan’s Northern
Territories); Chapter 3, Section 5-5-4 (Relations with Former
Soviet Republics)

against Ukraine marks a significant turning point in the
European security environment. Clearly, the aggression
by Russia, which saw NATO’s eastward expansion as
a threat to itself, prompted European countries to shift
their security policies in this manner. The aggression
has made it hard for Russia to say that it has achieved
its strategic goal of gaining security for itself through
maintaining its “sphere of influence.” In this regard,
based on the recognition that the security of Europe and
that of the Indo-Pacific region including Eastern Asia
are indivisible, Japan needs to pay attention to the future
developments of the situation in Europe, including its
strategic effects. This is because Japan is a close ally of
the United States, a NATO member state, and is located
on the opposite side of Europe across the Eurasian
Continent where Russia also sits. In addition, the
change in the European situation in response to Russia’s
aggression against Ukraine can also have an impact on
global affairs including developments of the strategic
competition between the United States and China and
impact on Asia. In any case, it is necessary to monitor the
related situations closely with great interest.

For Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, Russia has
had to pay a high price not only because Ukraine itself
strongly resists Russia’s aggression but also because the
international community imposes strong coordinated
sanctions against Russia and continues to support
Ukraine. In addition, European countries stand more
united against Russian threats, and Russia’s aggression

8 Military cooperation between Iran and Russia is progressing. It is probable that Russia acquired Iranian UAVs to compensate for the missile shortage, and it was reported on January 15, 2023, that
Iran was scheduled to receive in spring of that year Russian Su-35 jets (a 4.5 generation fighter held only in the AFRF and China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA)), and had ordered Russian air
defense systems, missile systems, helicopters, and other equipment.

9 Above all, Kazakhstan reacts most severely. The country clearly denied according governments of the so-called “Donetsk People’s Republic” and “Luhansk People’s Republic” diplomatic recognition,
and approved a law to prohibit weapon export to other countries for one year.

10 According to announcements by the Ukraine General Staff Office and articles of Russian media related to the Ministry of Defense, the AFRF 29th Army, 35th Army, and 36th Army from the Eastern
Military District, and 68th Corps controlling troops placed in Southern Sakhalin and Northern Territories were transferred to eastern Ukraine after participating in the attack of Kyiv, and 40th and

from October 2022. As continuous missile attacks by
Russia are expected, the donor countries announced that
they will provide missile systems capable of defending
ballistic missiles. In January 2023, the countries for the
first time announced provision of tanks and infantry
fighting vehicles manufactured outside former Soviet
Union states, and in February, the delivery to Ukraine
was started with the handing over of German-made tanks
from Poland. Some NATO member states stated that
they would deliver fighter jets made by former Soviet
Union in March 2023, and the United Kingdom and the
Netherlands stated in May that the two countries would
establish an “international coalition” for fighter jets
acquisition and flight trainings. Furthermore, the United
States stated in the G7 summit meeting that it would
support the multilateral initiative for the flight trainings
of fourth generation fighter jets including F-16s.
Among all of this support from various countries,
the contribution of the United States is prominent. The
cumulative security support from the United States
to Ukraine under the Biden administration is USD 38
billion, including USD 37.3 billion announced after
start of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine (as of May
21, 2023). The United States clearly shows a strong
supporting attitude towards Ukraine providing not
only a variety of equipment in large quantities but also
familiarization training for newly delivered equipment
and boot camp training outside Ukraine. President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the United States in
December 2022, and said support from the United States
is “an investment in global security and democracy”
in his speech to U.S. Congress appealing to American
people to continue support.
The United Kingdom also provided continuous support
to Ukraine through equipment support and dispatching
training instructors with the United States and other
countries from when Russia “annexed” the Crimean
Peninsula in 2014, and since the regime change from
the Johnson administration to the Sunak administration,
it has continuously and actively supported Ukraine by
providing a variety of equipment and conducting boot
camp training. In particular, the United Kingdom took the
plunge to announce that it would provide its main battle
tanks in January 2023 ahead of any other country, and this


**2 NATO’s response**

Russia’s aggression against Ukraine prompted a rapidly
growing alarm amid European countries, and Russia’s
aggressive actions are being viewed as the most
significant and direct threat to European and northern
Atlantic security.[11] With renewed awareness of the threat
of Russia, NATO member states direct their efforts at
enhancing defense cooperation under the collective
defense system of NATO, and pursue the development
of defense capabilities in each country. For example, the
unit scale in the eastern direction is expanded as needed,
and an agreement has been made to put 300,000 and
more troops into high readiness conditions in place of
NATO Response Forces.

See Chapter 3, Section 9-2 (Enhancement of Multilateral Security

See

Frameworks)

The United States also intends to enhance the
strength of U.S. Armed Forces in Europe. In June 2022,
the United States announced among other measures
the establishment of U.S. Army V Corps permanent
headquarters in Poland, increasing the number of U.S.
destroyers based on Spanish ports, rotation deployment
of U.S. troops in Romania, and additional deployment of
an F-35 squadron to the United Kingdom.
Furthermore, several nations including NATO
member states provide equipment, training support, and
the like to Ukraine depending on the progress of the war.
At the beginning of the war, the donor countries provided
portable anti-tank missiles and man-portable surface-toair missiles that seemed to contribute to prevent front line
expansion by delaying advancement of Russian military
armored units and reducing the strength of airborne troops.
After the AFU stopped Russia’s full-scale invasion, the
countries moved towards providing large equipment
that helps suppression and securing wide area in ground
fighting, such as tanks, armored vehicles, and howitzers,
for the Ukrainian military’s counteroffensive. They also
came to provide longer range artillery to attack enemy
bases, following the concentration of AFRF troops in the
eastern Ukraine region. Furthermore, handing over of
air defense systems from various countries was rapidly
progressed as a result of Russia commencing missile
attacks targeting all over Ukraine including civil facilities

was the first announcement about delivery of main battle
tanks other than ones made in former Soviet Union states.
The United States and the United Kingdom actively
disclose information about Russian military movement
for the purpose of countering Russia’s disinformation and
containing the action of the AFRF through announcements
by high officials and posting on social media.
France, which acted as a mediator between Russia
and Ukraine together with Germany in the “Normandy
format”[12] aiming to bring the conflict in eastern Ukraine
to a peaceful resolution, announced delivery of equipment
such as wheeled combat vehicles and missile air-defense
systems to Ukraine. Germany drastically changed
its defense strategy after Russia’s aggression against
Ukraine, announcing to deliver infantry fighting vehicles
and surface-to-air missile systems, and took the plunge
to deliver its main battle tanks directly to Ukraine as
well as permit the transfer of German-made main battle
tanks from third party countries to Ukraine in January
2023. Canada that has been supporting the AFU through
providing training support from 2015, has turned to more
proactive support through enhancing its military support
since the start of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine to
over CA$1 billion as of the end of March 2023.
Other NATO member states also announced that they
would supply a considerable amount of equipment. In
particular, some Central and Eastern European countries,
which are considered to have a keen sense of alarm
towards Russia due to their historical circumstances and
geographical relations, have expressed active support to
Ukraine.
Furthermore, non-NATO member states have also
delivered military equipment to Ukraine. Among them,
notably, Sweden has decided to supply equipment against
its principle of not supplying weapons to countries
involved in a conflict.
The European Union (EU) also announced military
support to Ukraine of the whole sum of 3.6 billion euros
until March 2023 through the European Peace Facility,
a fund of the EU, and started a military support mission
to train 300,000 AFU soldiers within EU territory from
November 2022.
Technical support provided by private companies to
Ukraine is also attracting attention. Satellite internet
services using a small satellite constellation provided


by U.S. companies in response to the request from the
Ukrainian government are used not only as a means of
communications for the Ukrainian people but also are
utilized to operate the Ukrainian military’s unmanned
aircraft. Moreover, it is pointed out that some European
and U.S. IT/security companies have been supporting
Ukraine’s cybersecurity since before the aggression
against Ukraine began, and have successfully reduced
and localized damage from Russian cyber attacks.
While actors such as NATO member states and other
countries moved towards supporting Ukraine, Turkey that
has deep relations with both Russia and Ukraine shows
consideration for Russia to some extent. Concretely,
Turkey declares support for Ukraine while basically not
implementing economic sanctions against Russia. The
country also mediates the restarting to export grains
from Ukraine. Hungary that deeply depends on Russia
economically has not provided weapons to Ukraine
stating that it is not in its national interests, and takes
a conciliatory attitude to Russia among NATO member
states, as, for example, Hungary was initially against the
EU’s economic sanctions against Russia.

**3 Other Regions’ Response**

**Chapter**


A United Nations general meeting resolution that demands
immediate stop of Russia’s aggression was adopted by
approval of 141 member states, that is over 70% of UN
member states, on February 23, 2023, one year since
the start of the aggression against Ukraine. On the other
hand, in addition to Russia, some countries and regions
do not sympathize with this movement. For example, six
countries and regions including Belarus and North Korea
were against the resolution, and thirty-two countries
including India and China abstained from voting.
North Korea is showing its stance of standing by
Russia, for example, as it voted against the UN General
Assembly’s resolution calling for the immediate
withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine and claims
that the United States and other Western countries are
to be blamed for the conflict in Ukraine. Furthermore,
Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the
UN, announced in December 2022 that North Korea
completed its first weapons delivery including infantry
rocket launchers and missiles to Russian private military

deny this, if weapons are actually being delivered from
North Korea, it not only benefits Russia’s aggression,
but also is unacceptable because it violates the related
Security Council resolution prohibiting all acquisition
of weapons and related supplies from North Korea. The
international community must monitor future actions to
enhance the relationship of these countries under close
coordination.

While Iran has been increasingly opposed to Western
countries since its secession from the nuclear agreement
with the United States in 2018, it is enhancing its
relationship with Russia, particularly in the economic and
military domains. Iran made an argument for a diplomatic
solution in regard to the aggression against Ukraine, but
shows sympathy to Russia’s standpoint to the extent of
insisting that if Russia had not acted then NATO would
have provoked the war. President Raisi of Iran and
Secretary Patrushev of the Security Council of Russia
talked together in November 2022. The Iranian side
stated it would raise its level of strategic relationship with
Russia in various fields and criticized sanctions against
Russia by the United States and its allies. The United
States announced in July 2022 Iran’s plan to provide
UAVs to Russia, and in September 2022, pointed out that
Russia was using Iran-made UAVs for attacks as well as
Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR). The
Ukrainian military also announced that Russia conducted
attacks in various points of Ukraine using Iranian UAVs.
To this, Iran claims that the delivery of Iranian UAVs
to Russia was carried out before the aggression against
Ukraine and suggests that their purpose was not for use in
war with Ukraine. William Burns, Director of the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA), pointed out in February 2023
that Russia investigates possibilities to support Iran’s
missile plan and provide fighter jets as consideration for
Iran’s support, and therefore it is necessary to observe
closely the progression of cooperation between the two
countries.
China avoids direct criticism of Russia in respect of
the aggression, requesting “self-restraint and dialogue”
to both Russia and Ukraine, and takes a standpoint
from which China will play constructive roles in its
own ways towards a solution to the Ukraine issues.
However, China insists that Russia’s actions are caused
by the “Cold War mentality” of the United States and


other NATO countries, and that it understands Russia s
reasonable concerns about security issues, and criticizes
sanctions against Russia and equipment delivery to
Ukraine from Western countries. President Xi Jinping
stated that China would strongly support Russia on
issues about mutual core interests at the China-Russia
Summit Meeting in September 2022 that was held faceto-face for the first time after the start of the aggression.
He also announced in regard to the aggression against
Ukraine, that “China will continuously maintain an
objective and fair standpoint, encourage the formation
of collaborated influence in the international community,
and take a constructive role towards peaceful resolution
of the Ukraine crises” in an online China-Russia Summit
Meeting in December 2022. Furthermore, he stated that
China will play constructive roles in peace negotiations
and reconstruction after the conflict in a document
titled “China’s Position on the Political Settlement of
the Ukraine Crisis” published in February 2023. Xi
also rated highly Russia’s intention to reopen dialogue
with Ukraine as quickly as possible and was opposed
to unilateral sanctions without the resolution of United
Nations Security Council in the joint communique
resulting from the meeting with President Putin held in
Russia in March 2023. Russia, which is internationally
isolated with its aggression against Ukraine, especially in
its ground forces, will likely find its political and military
cooperation with China more important than ever.
On the other hand, it is seen that Western counties
are taking actions to contain China that is deepening
cooperation with Russia. In September 2022, NATO
Secretary General Stoltenberg pointed out that China
continued to cooperate with Russia and opposed
expanding NATO even after the aggression against
Ukraine, and the notion that NATO should regard China
as a challenge for international security was adequately
reasonable. The United States added Chinese entities
including companies regarded as providing satellite
images to Russian private military company Wagner
to the list of entities subject to regulations for export
from the United States. Furthermore, Antony Blinken,
U.S. Secretary of State, warned Wang Yi, Director of
the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the
Communist Party of China Central Committee, during
their meeting in February 2023 that delivery of lethal
weapons to Russia would have serious consequences for
the U.S.-China relationship.

strengthen military cooperation in the area around Japan
since the aggression against Ukraine; for example,
bombers of both countries conducted joint flights in the
airspace surrounding Japan, warships of both navies
conducted joint navigations in the area near Japan, and
joint naval training was conducted in the area from
the Sea of Japan to the Sea of Okhotsk as a part of the
“Vostok 2022” exercise. Japan must closely monitor the
possibility of deeper military cooperation between China
and Russia with concern, including cooperation in the Far
East and East Asia where the two countries are situated,
considering Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.

India emphasized the need for an immediate stop
of hostile operations and violence, as well as the need
for a solution through diplomatic means and dialogue
regarding the aggression against Ukraine, and Indian
Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated “now is not the
age of war” to President Putin at the Indo-Russia Summit
Meeting in September 2022, while India, which has
traditionally deep relations with Russia, avoids explicit
criticism of Russia. As stated above, India maintains a
strong military cooperative relationship with Russia, and
responses such as increasing import of Russian crude oil
with lower prices due to the economic sanctions have
been observed. Close attention should be paid to India’s
movement in future.

October 2022, the United States expressed its recognition The NSS states that China presents America’s most
that it faces two strategic challenges of “geopolitical consequential geopolitical challenge and is the only

In addition, the Department of Defense (DoD)
released the National Defense Strategy (NDS) in October
2022 and expressed its intention to advance “Integrated
Deterrence,” “Campaigning,” and “Building enduring
advantages” while identifying top level priorities that
the DoD must pursue to strengthen deterrence such as
defending homeland and deterring strategic attacks. On
top of that, the DoD showed its recognition that mutually-

rights issues in its relations with China. The Uyghur
Forced Labor Prevention Act went into effect in June
2022, banning the import of all products produced
in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region unless
the company could prove the products were not made
with forced labor. Also, the United States hosted a
summit-level meeting on the launch of the Indo-Pacific
Economic Framework[3] (IPEF) in May 2022. The IPEF
launched by thirteen countries in the Indo-Pacific region
including Japan presented an idea to aim for resilient and
integrated supply chains as one of the four IPEF pillars.
At the Japan-U.S.-Australia-India (the Quad) Summit
Meeting held in May 2022, the leaders also announced
a joint statement regarding critical technology supply
chains, promoting cooperation to improve resilience
against various risks to the region.
While it competes strategically with China, the United
States has stated its policy to seek greater strategic
stability through the following measures; manage the
competition responsibly, reduce the risk of unintended
military escalation, and ultimately engage China on
more formal arms control efforts. In addition, the
Biden administration always shows a cooperative
attitude to China where their interests align with
challenges requiring cooperation such as climate change
and nuclear non-proliferation.
In regard to Russia, the United States evaluates
that Russia poses an immediate and ongoing threat to
the regional security order in Europe and it is a source
of disruption and instability globally but it lacks the
across the spectrum capabilities of China as Russian
government has chosen to pursue an imperialist foreign
policy with the goal of overturning key elements of
the international order. Based on the above, the United
States expressed its policy to prioritize maintaining an
enduring competitive edge over China while constraining
a still profoundly dangerous Russia. Furthermore, the
Biden administration evaluates Russia’s aggression
against Ukraine as a strategic failure that profoundly
has diminished Russia’s status vis-a-vis China and other
Asian powers such as India and Japan. On the other hand,
together with NATO allies, the United States evaluates
that they are strengthening their defense and deterrence
and welcoming Finland and Sweden to NATO will
further improve their security and capabilities.


In regard to relations with North Korea, the
administration announced the completion of a review
of its policy toward North Korea in April 2021, and has
indicated that it intends to advance diplomacy with North
Korea through a “calibrated, practical approach” with
the goal of “complete denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula.” The administration has also made clear its
intention to advance its consideration in consultation with
allies and partners, such as the Republic of Korea (ROK)
and Japan, at every step of the response to North Korea.
In regard to the Middle East, the U.S. military
withdrew from Afghanistan at the end of August 2021,
ending the 20-year U.S. military presence in the region.
The termination of the combat mission of the U.S.
military in Iraq was announced in December of the
same year. U.S. forces stationed there continue to have
the duties of providing advice, support, and training
to the Iraqi military. In addition, regarding the nuclear
agreement with Iran, from which the former Trump
administration declared its withdrawal in May 2018,
the Biden administration has continued talks with Iran
towards rebuilding the agreement since April 2021, but
conclusion of negotiations has not been reached.
The Biden administration has indicated that its foreign
policy direction will be based on international cooperation
and that its responses will be made in close collaboration
with allies and partners. As a concrete move for this, in
September 2021, the Japan-U.S.-Australia-India (Quad)
summit meeting was held for the first time in-person.
The leaders affirmed that their countries, as democratic
partners with a common vision, would unite to address
major contemporary challenges such as critical and
emerging technologies, and affirmed their commitment
to a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific.” In the same month,
the leaders of Australia, the United Kingdom, and the
United States announced the establishment of AUKUS,
a new trilateral security cooperation framework aimed at
deepening diplomatic, security, and defense cooperation
in the Indo-Pacific region. AUKUS will deepen
cooperation on various security and defense capabilities
such as cyber and artificial intelligence. As the first
initiative, the countries agreed to cooperate for the
acquisition of nuclear submarines by Australia. In April
2022, the countries announced that they will also deepen
cooperation on hypersonic capabilities, electronic

increasingly severe environmental conditions. The Plan
calls for addressing climate change challenges not only
through DoD efforts but also across the entire federal
government as well as with allies and partners.

**2 NSS and NDS**


**Part**
**Ⅰ**

**Chapter**


The NSS presents three lines of effort to realize free,
open, prosperous, and secure international order;
namely, 1) investing in the U.S. national power,
2) building the strongest coalition of nations, and
3) modernizing and strengthening the U.S. Military. The
NSS also indicates six pillars as concrete approaches
to realize these directions; namely, 1) breaking down
the dividing line between foreign policy and domestic
policy, 2) alliances and partnerships, 3) perception of
geopolitical challenges, 4) involvement in other areas,
5) correspondence with new economic situations, and
6) maintaining and increasing international cooperation.
On top of that, the NSS shows the policies that the
United States focuses on investment in domestic strength
as a source of American power, positions alliances and
partnerships as its most important strategic asset, and
deals with strategic challenges. Furthermore, the NSS
presents a policy that the United States will cooperate
with any countries including non-democracies that are
willing to work constructively with the U.S. to address
“shared challenges” which are cross-border issues
including climate change.
The NDS presents four top-level defense priorities to
support a stable and open international system and defense
commitments; namely, 1) defending the U.S. homeland, 2)
deterring strategic attacks, 3) deterring aggression while
being prepared to prevail in conflict, 4) building a resilient
Joint Force and defense ecosystem. The NDS also indicates
an idea to advance the top-level defense priorities through
1) Integrated deterrence, 2) Campaigning, and 3) Building
enduring advantages. With regard to deterring aggression
while being prepared to prevail in conflicts, the DoD
indicates a policy prioritizing the China’s challenge in the
Indo-Pacific region, then Russia’s challenge in Europe. As
such, attention will be focused on how the United States
will deal with these challenges.

**3 Engagement in the Indo-Pacific Region**


The NSS raises “geopolitical competition between
the major powers” and “shared challenges” as the two
strategic issues the United States faces now. Based on the
understanding that the most pressing strategic challenge
to pursuing a free, open, prosperous, and secure world
is from powers that layer authoritarian governance with
a revisionist foreign policy, the NSS also shows its
recognition that the next ten years would be the decisive
decade in setting the terms of the competition with
China, managing the acute threat posed by Russia, and
in its efforts to deal with shared challenges, particularly
climate change and pandemics. The NDS states that
China seeks to undermine U.S. alliances and security
partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region, and leverage its
growing capabilities, including its economic influence
and the People’s Liberation Army’s growing strength and
military footprint, to coerce its neighbors and threaten
their interests. As a result, the United States regards
China’s coercive and increasingly aggressive endeavor
as the most comprehensive and serious challenge to U.S.
national security. On the other hand, the NDS indicates that
the DoD would support robust deterrence of aggression
by Russia that poses acute threats such as its aggression
against Ukraine with its allies and partners. North Korea
is mentioned as a persistent threat continuing to expand
its nuclear and missile capability to threaten the U.S.
homeland and East Asia, and Iran is mentioned as further
undermining Middle East stability by supporting terrorist
groups and malicious cyber operations. Also, the NDS
shows the perception that these competitors seek adverse
changes in the status quo using gray zone methods.
Furthermore, the Biden administration has shown great
interest in the effects of climate change on security. In
October 2021, Secretary of Defense Austin announced
the Department of Defense Climate Adaptation Plan,
which will serve as a guide for maintaining the readiness
and resilience of the U S military in the future under

with allies including Japan in the Indo Pacific region

and promote a Free and Open Indo-Pacific through
multilateral frameworks such as the Quad and AUKUS.
With regard to the relationship with Japan, the United
States reaffirms its unwavering commitment to the
defense of Japan under mutual security treaty, which
covers the Senkaku Islands. In addition, the NSS shows an
intention to expand its regional diplomacy, development,
and economic engagement, with a particular focus on
Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Regarding the
relationship with India, which is the world’s largest
democratic country and a major defense partner, the
NSS states that the United States and India will work
together, bilaterally and multilaterally, to support their
shared vision of a “free and open Indo-Pacific” and
that the United States will promote prosperity and
economic connectivity across the Indian Ocean region
by addressing climate change and China’s coercive
behavior with regional partners in South Asia, including
India.
The Indo-Pacific Strategy, which was released in
February 2022, clearly indicated that the United States
will continue to place the highest priority on the IndoPacific region where faces increasing challenges from
China. It also made clear that the United States will
cooperate with allies and partners in efforts to advance
a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” and strengthen regional
security.
In July 2020, regarding China’s maritime expansion,
after the U.S. DoD expressed concern about China’s
decision to conduct military exercises in the South
China Sea, the United States deployed two Carrier Strike
Groups in the South China Sea for the first time in about
six years and conducted naval exercises. Since then,
the United States has continued Carrier Strike Group
operations in the same region to demonstrate continuously
its commitment to promote a “Free and Open IndoPacific” to allies in the region. In January 2022, the State
Department released a study examining China’s claims
regarding its maritime rights in the South China Sea in
light of international law. The study noted that China’s
claims over most of the South China Sea are inconsistent
with international law and gravely undermine the rule of
law in the ocean. In addition, U.S. Vice President Harris


visited the Philippines and met with President Marcos in
November 2022 and reconfirmed the U.S. commitment
to the mutual defense obligation against armed attack
on the Armed Forces of Philippines in the South China
Sea. Also, both countries agreed at the U.S.-Philippine
Defense Ministers’ Meeting held in February 2023 to
expand the list of bases available for U.S. Armed Forces.
As part of its activities around strengthening its
presence in the Indo-Pacific region, the U.S. Navy which
promotes Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO)[4]
deployed the USS America, an amphibious assault ship
with enhanced ability to carry F-35B fighters and other
carrier-based aircrafts to Sasebo in December 2019, and
deployed for the first time the MQ-4C Triton unmanned
maritime reconnaissance vehicle in Guam in January
2020. The U.S. Air Force which promotes Agile Combat
Employment (ACE)[5] conducts ACE exercises in the
Indo-Pacific region using fighter jets and unmanned
aircraft. Furthermore, the U.S. Army which promotes
the Multi-Domain Operations concept announced in
September 2022 the deployment of a Multi-Domain Task
Force[6] in Hawaii to undertake operations simultaneously
in all domains including the aspect of human cognition.
The U.S. Marine Corps which promotes Expeditionary
Advanced Base Operations (EABO)[7] deployed its first
Marine Littoral Regiment (MLR) with capabilities to
conduct EABO activities in Hawaii in March 2022, and
announced in January 2023 that it would reorganize the
12th Marine Regiment stationed in Okinawa into a MLR
by 2025. In March 2018, the aircraft carrier USS Carl
Vinson made the first port call by a U.S. aircraft carrier
in over 40 years in Vietnam. Another port call in the
country was made in March 2020, by the aircraft carrier
USS Theodore Roosevelt.
The United States has continued to conduct “Freedom
of Navigation Operations” in the South China Sea, and
U.S. Navy vessels have passed through the Taiwan Strait
in order to show the U.S. commitment to a “Free and
Open Indo-Pacific.” At this announcement, the United
States clearly indicated that it would bear a number
of responsibilities in the Indo-Pacific region, with
the protection of the rights and freedom of navigation
in accordance with international law being one of

the responsibilities, and therefore, the country would
continue the “Freedom of Navigation Operations.”
Based on the posture towards the Indo-Pacific
described above, the United States appears to continue to
be undertaking initiatives based on its vision of a “Free
and Open Indo-Pacific.”
In contrast, while talks between the United States
and North Korea have been conducted since their first
summit meeting in history held in June 2018, no specific
progress has been seen with regard to the dismantlement
of North Korea’s missiles and weapons of mass
destruction. The United States and South Korea took
steps including cancelling or downgrading scheduled
Joint U.S.-ROK exercises in response to the meeting.
Then Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan
expressed in regard to the U.S.-ROK exercises a
willingness to maintain U.S. Forces in the ROK, stating
that close coordination between the military activities
of the United States and the ROK will continue to
support diplomatic efforts and that the two countries
were committed to ensuring the continued combined
defense posture of U.S.-ROK combined forces and
maintaining firm military readiness. The United States
and the ROK have been expanding the scope and scale
of exercises since the Yoon Suk-yeol administration of
ROK, which exhibits a firm stance against North Korea,
was inaugurated in May 2022. In the context of this
situation, Kim Jong-un, Chairman of the State Affairs
Commission of North Korea, is reacting sharply, such as
he reportedly stated the aim of the United States was “to
disrupt my regime anytime,” and, to restrain the United
States on a long-term basis, “we can never abandon
nuclear weapons.”
The U.S. Government expresses in the NSS its
intention to seek a sustained diplomatic relationship
with North Korea in order to achieve concrete progress
towards complete denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula, while it states in the NDS that the DoD will
deter attacks through forward posture of U.S. forces
and nuclear deterrence against North Korea, which
continues to expand its nuclear and missile capability
and has been trying to drive wedges among the allies.
At the present point, no concrete progress can be seen
in the disarmament of North Korea’s weapons of mass
destruction and missiles. However, attention will be
paid to how the United States advances its policy toward
North Korea going forward.

**4 Innovation in the National Defense Field**


In President Biden’s remarks at the DoD in February
2021, the President, emphasizing the importance of
technologies in national defense strategies, stated
that the United States would deal with dangers and
opportunities generated through emerging technologies,
enhance its capabilities in cyberspace, and lead in a
new era of competition from deep sea to outer space.
In addition, the NDS states that the DoD will support
the innovation ecosystem to develop defense equipment
through cooperation among research institutes, private
companies, and government agencies as one of the
approaches to building enduring advantages. It also
aims to promote research and development for advanced
capabilities including in directed energy and cyber
as well as create opportunities in biotechnology and
quantum science. Attention will be focused on activities
in this field.

**5 Nuclear and Missile Defense Policy**


**Part**
**Ⅰ**

**Chapter**


In October 2022, the DoD released the Nuclear Posture
Review (NPR) and the Missile Defense Review (MDR)
on the same day as NDS, which had previously been
published individually, to ensure tight linkages between
each strategy.
In the NPR, the DoD expresses that China is the
overall “pacing challenge” for U.S. defense planning
and a growing factor in evaluating its nuclear deterrent,
and evaluates that China will become a major nuclear
power following Russia by the 2030s and the United
States will, for the first time in its history, face two major
nuclear powers. It also states that Russia continues to
emphasize nuclear weapons in its strategy, modernize
and expand its nuclear forces, and brandish its nuclear
weapons in support of its revisionist security policy,
while recognizing that Russia’s modern nuclear arsenal
presents an enduring existential threat to the United
States and its Allies and partners, and the possibility of
the limited use of nuclear weapons in order to avoid a
defeat. The NPR mentions that North Korea is not a rival
on the same scale as China and Russia, but it poses a
persistent threat as it expands non-nuclear capabilities
as well, including its chemical weapon stockpile, in
addition to nuclear and ballistic missiles. Furthermore,
the DoD evaluates that a crisis or conflict on the Korean
Peninsula could involve a number of nuclear armed


S


-----

actors, raising the risk of broader conflict.
In showing such recognition across nuclear situation,
the U.S. Government expressed its intention to continue
to pursue engagement with other nuclear-armed states
where possible to reduce nuclear risks, setting a key goal
of reducing the role of nuclear weapons. The following
were raised as the roles for U.S. nuclear weapons: (1)
deter strategic attacks; (2) assure allies and partners;
and (3) achieve U.S. objectives if deterrence fails,
while “hedging against an uncertain future,” which
was raised as one of the roles for nuclear weapons in
the NPR released under the Trump administration
in 2018, was eliminated this time. Also, as the U.S.
declaratory policy, the administration expressed that the
fundamental role of nuclear weapons is to deter nuclear
attacks by adversary, and the United States would
only consider the employment of nuclear weapons in
extreme circumstances. Although the U.S. Government
conducted a thorough review of a broad range of options
for nuclear declaratory policy including both “No First
Use” and “Sole Purpose” policies, it concluded that those
approaches would result in an unacceptable level of risk
in light of the range of non-nuclear capabilities being
developed and fielded by competitors that could inflict
strategic-level damage to the United States and its allies
and partners, but it indicated that the government retains
the goal of moving toward a sole purpose declaration.
Based on the understanding that the U.S. nuclear
deterrence strategies require tailored strategies for
potential adversaries, the NPR mentioned that the United
States would maintain a flexible deterrence strategy and
force posture against China, while it would bolster the
nuclear Triad[8] against Russia through fielding a modern
nuclear Triad and with flexible, tailorable nuclear forces
to deter both large-scale attacks and limited strikes. It
also indicated that the United States would work on the
replacement program for the nuclear triad, which most
systems are operating beyond their original design life,
to avoid any gaps in its nuclear deterrent, ensuring that
the United States can withstand any strategic attack,
tailor its deterrence strategies as needed, and assure
Allies in support of its extended deterrence commitments
by maintaining a modern Triad. Furthermore, the NPR
expressed that the government cancelled the nucleararmed Sea-Launched Cruise Missile (SLCM-N) program
which was introduced in the previous NPR, while


maintaining currently operating low yield submarine
launched ballistic missile (SLBM) as flexible, tailorable
nuclear forces. Also mentioned is a plan to transfer the
roles of dual-capable aircraft (DCA) from F-15E fighters
to F-35A fighters in order to support NATO nuclear
missions.
Moreover, the U.S. Government withdrew from the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty on
August 2, 2019 as the government alleged that Russia
violated the treaty. In the same month, the United States
conducted a flight test of a conventionally configured
ground-launched missile with a range of more than 500
km. In this regard, the United States has been working
on the development of intermediate-range, conventional,
and ground-launched missiles whose test launches,
production and possession had been restricted by the
treaty.
President Putin stated in his annual presidential
address to the Federal Assembly of Russia in February
2023 that the implementation of the New START Treaty
(New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty), extended for
five years in February 2021 based on the agreement
between the United States and Russia, has been halted.
Attention will be focused on future movement of nuclear
arms control.
The MDR, whose contents strongly reflect the
“integrated deterrence” concept mentioned in the NDS,
expresses a concept that in order to protect the United
States and deter attacks, missile defenses are positioned
as a top priority area, and that they offset benefits of
an enemy attack and are useful to limit damage when
deterrence has been breached. Also, the U.S. Government
declares that it will recognize attacks on any U.S. territory
overseas including Guam as attacks directed at the U.S.
mainland, and states that Guam is vital as an operation
base to maintain a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific,” and
that defending Guam helps realize integrated deterrence.

In March 2023, the United States government released
the President’s budget request for FY2024 discretionary
funding. The budget request for the DoD is approximately

which indicates a policy to prioritize responding to China
by positioning China as a “pacing challenge.”
Based on above, the DoD requests US$9.1 billion for
the Pacific Deterrence Initiative in order to strengthen
deterrence against China in the Indo-Pacific region and
expresses its intention to invest in maintaining support
for Ukraine and European allies confronting Russia’s
aggression.


The budget also requests a record US$315 billion for
acquisition and R&D of equipment, and a record US$145
billion for R&D on innovation and modernization.
The goals for military end strength include securing
1,305,400 troops, an increase of around 9,100 from
FY2023, and, in terms of equipment, the procurement of
83 F-35 fighter jets.

The U.S. air forces have roughly 3,500 combat
aircraft across the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps.
In addition to carrier-based aircraft deployed at sea, part
of the tactical air force is forward-deployed in Germany,
the United Kingdom, Japan, and the ROK, among others.
In regard to strategic offensive weapons including
nuclear force, the United States proceeded with its

The operation of the U.S. Forces is not controlled by the
individual branches of the broader armed forces; rather it
is operated under the command of the Unified Combatant
Commands, composed of forces from multiple branches
of the armed forces. The Unified Combatant Commands
consist of four commands with functional responsibilities
and seven commands with regional responsibilities.
The U.S. ground forces have about 460,000 Army
soldiers and about 170,000 Marines, which are forwarddeployed in Germany, the ROK, and Japan, among other
countries.
The U.S. maritime forces have about 970 vessels
(including about 70 submarines) totaling about 7.2 million
tons. The 7th Fleet is responsible for the western Pacific
and the Indian Ocean; the 3rd Fleet in the eastern Pacific;

these capabilities will reinforce China’s **“Anti-Access/**
**Area-Denial (A2/AD)” capabilities and lead to the**
establishment of operational capabilities further afield.
China is also prioritizing efforts to increase practical joint
operational capabilities through military modernization


**1 General Situation**

For more than 30 years, China has sustained high-level
growth of its defense budget without transparency,
engaging in broad, rapid improvement of its military
power in qualitative and quantitative terms with focus
on nuclear, missile, naval and air forces. In doing so, it
has attached importance to strengthening its operational
capabilities for steadily acquiring information
superiority for the purpose of enhancing operational
capabilities throughout the Chinese military and gaining
asymmetrical capabilities to effectively impede enemies
with overall military superiority from exerting their
strength. Specifically, China has been increasingly
emphasizing endeavors to achieve dominance in new
domains. For example, it has been rapidly expanding its
capabilities in the cyber domain, enabling it to disrupt
enemy communications networks, and in the field of
electromagnetic spectrum, which offers the potential
to render enemy radar and other equipment ineffective,
thereby hampering their ability to exercise their military
might. In addition, it continues to build capacity to make
it possible to restrict enemies’ use of space Bolstering


**KEY WORDS**

**Anti-Access/Area-Denial (A2/AD) capabilities**

The A2/AD capabilities represent a concept given by the United States.
Anti-Access or A2 capabilities refer mainly to long-range capabilities to
block adversaries from entering some operating zones. Area-Denial or AD
capabilities refer to short-range capabilities to limit adversaries’ freedom of
action within operating zones.


**KEY WORDS**

**Civil-military fusion**

Civil-military fusion is an initiative promoted by China as a national
strategy designed to promote the military use of civilian resources and the
civilian use of military technologies in peacetime as well as emergency, in
addition to the traditional development of defense mobilization arrangements
for emergency. In particular, initiatives in seas, outer space, cyberspace, and
artificial intelligence (AI), which are referred to as “emerging areas” for
China are viewed as priority areas for civil-military fusion.


-----

including reforms. Additionally, while implementing
a development strategy of **civil-military fusion across**
the board, with the aim of promoting two-way links
between military and civilian resources in technology
development and various other fields, China is striving to
develop and acquire cutting-edge technologies that can
be used for military purposes. Cutting-edge technologies
that China seeks to develop and acquire include game
changing technologies that would dramatically change
future warfare.
Xi Jinping also reported at the 20th CCP Congress
“we will continue integrated development of the
military through mechanization, informatization, and the
application of smart technologies (intelligentization).”
Attention should be paid to measures related to the use
of artificial intelligence (AI) by the People’s Liberation
Army (PLA).
Along with the reinforcement of its operational
capabilities, China has intensified the unilateral changes
to the status quo by force and such attempts in the
maritime and air domains including in the East and South
China Seas, such as its intrusions into the territorial
waters and airspace around the Senkaku Islands, and has
expanded and intensified its military activities that affect
Japan’s national security in the Sea of Japan, the Pacific
Ocean, and other areas as well. China, particularly
regarding maritime issues where its interests conflict with
others’, continues to act in an assertive manner, which
includes dangerous acts that could cause unintended
contingencies. China has also been intensifying its
military activities around Taiwan. Moreover, moves
to strengthen China-Russia cooperation, including on
military activities, have been further intensifying.
The Chinese military leadership has exhibited the
“struggle” against the Senkaku Islands, an inherent
territory of Japan, the establishment of the “East China
Sea Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ),”[1] its
Navy and Air Force’s “regular patrols,” and others as
the achievements of the military forces’ activities and
emphasized to continue improving the Chinese military’s
operational capabilities. Furthermore, the Chinese
military forces have rapidly expanded and intensified
activities including those in the areas surrounding Japan,
such as the East China Sea, Pacific Ocean and Sea of


Japan. Given these facts, there is a high probability that
China would not only attempt to make such activities
routine but also further expand and intensify them both
qualitatively and quantitatively. China’s current external
stance, military activities, and other activities have
become a matter of serious concern for Japan and the
international community, and present an unprecedented
and the greatest strategic challenge in ensuring the peace
and security of Japan and the peace and stability of the
international community, as well as in strengthening
the international order based on the rule of law, to
which Japan should respond with its comprehensive
national power including its defense capabilities and in
cooperation and collaboration with its ally, like-minded
countries, and others.

**2 Defense Policies**


**Part**
**Ⅰ**

**Chapter**


China has described the objectives of its defense policies
and the missions of its military forces as: supporting
the CCP’s leadership, China’s characteristic socialism
system, and the modernization of its socialism; defending
the nation’s sovereignty, unification and security;
backing the nation’s sustainable “peaceful development”
through protecting its maritime and overseas national
interests; building strong national defense and massive
military forces commensurate with the interests of the
nation’s security and the interests of development; and
providing strong assurances for realizing the “Chinese
dream” of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
China contends that these national defense policies are
“defensive” in nature.[2]

For the development of national defense and military
forces, China has employed a policy of building the
“system of modern military power with Chinese
characteristics” by sustaining the military development
under the party, the military buildup through reforms,
military promotion based on science and technology,
and law-based military governance, by pursuing
practical capabilities that “can fight and win a war” by
giving greater priority to the civil-military fusion, by
promoting the fusion and development of mechanization,
informatization, and intelligentization. This might have
apparently deepened a policy of giving priority to the


On November 23, 2013, China established the “East China Sea ADIZ” including the Senkaku Islands misleadingly indicated as if they were China’s territory. China requires aircraft flying in the zone
to abide by rules set by its Ministry of National Defense and claims to take military “defensive emergency measures” against aircraft failing to do so, unduly infringing on the principle of freedom of
overflight. Over the move to unilaterally change the status quo in the East China Sea, not only Japan but also the United States, the ROK, Australia, and the European Union (EU) expressed concerns.


-----

informatization of military forces based on a military
strategy to win informatized local wars in response to
the global trend of military development. Such military
buildup in China apparently indicates that China has
given top priority to dealing with a Taiwan contingency
by improving its capabilities to deter or deny Taiwan’s
independence and foreign military support for the
Taiwanese independence, and has recently considered
the improvement of operational capabilities in more
distant waters to protect its expanding overseas interests.
Furthermore, China seems to emphasize not only
physical means but also non-physical means in military
affairs and warfare. It regards the concept of “Three
Warfare” - “Media Warfare,” “Psychological Warfare,”
and “Legal Warfare” - as part of the political work of
the military. In addition, China has set forth a policy
of coordinating military struggle closely with political,
diplomatic, economic, cultural, and legal endeavors.
As for the future goals of the development of national
defense and military forces, General Secretary Xi
Jinping’s report to the 19th CCP National Congress in
October 2017 and the defense white paper released in
2019 noted that China would try to (1) basically achieve
mechanization and make great progress in informatization
to dramatically improve strategic capabilities by 2020,
(2) basically complete the modernization of national
defense and military forces by 2035, and (3) generally
transform Chinese forces into world-class forces by the
mid-21st century.
In the 5th Plenary Session held in October 2020,
the goal year for 1st stage mentioned above, China’s
determination to achieve a struggle goal for the 100th
anniversary of the foundation of the PLA in 2027 was
announced. The new “three-step development strategy”
was stipulated in the so-called “historic resolution”
in 6th Plenary Session in 2021, which consists of the
achievement of the 100th anniversary struggle goal of
the PLA by 2027 as the first step, and achievement of the
aforementioned goals by 2035 and the mid-21st century
as the second and third steps respectively. Furthermore,
the report of 20th CCP Congress in 2022 newly stated
that elevating the PLA to world-class standards “more
quickly” is a strategic task for building a modern socialist
country in all respects, and it is possible that the CCP is


considering moving forward its target of establishing
world-class forces,” scheduled for the mid-21st century.
However, China has recognized a wide gap between
the real military modernization level and the level
required for national security, and between Chinese and
world-class military forces. Although China has not
defined what it means by “world-class forces,” it has
been pointed out that China may seek to develop military
forces that equal to - or in some cases superior to - the
U.S. military. Furthermore, it has also been pointed out
that China aims to build “world-class forces” capable
of “intelligentized warfare” by acquiring advanced
technology and becoming an “innovation superpower.”[3]
In light of this, it is suggested that China is planning to
offset its military power gap with the U.S. military, and
may recognize that the “intelligentization” of its forces
is a necessary condition for this. It is thought that China
will aim to build an army that can “fight and win a war”
against the U.S. military in the “intelligentized warfare”
of the future.[4]

Based on that recognition, it is expected that China
will further accelerate the military modernization
against the backdrop of national power development and
General Secretary Xi’s enhancement of his power base
in the CCP in his third term and expansion of his power
as Chairman of the Central Military Commission.[5]

**3 Transparency Concerning Defense**
**Policies and Military Affairs**


**Part**
**Ⅰ**

**Chapter**


China has neither set out a clear and specific future
vision of its military strengthening, nor ensured adequate
transparency of its decision-making process in relation
to military and security affairs. Although China has
released a defense white paper roughly every two years
since 1998, it has not fully disclosed information such as
specific equipment in its possession, procurement goals
and results, organization and locations of major units,
records of main military operations and training, and a
detailed breakdown of its national defense budget, even
in the latest white paper “China’s National Defense in
the New Era,” released in July 2019 for the first time
approximately in four years.
Incidents in which Chinese authorities provide factually


According to the annual report “Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China,” U.S. DoD (2021)

There is a view that “intelligentization” of the military provides an excellent opportunity for a latecomer’s military to leap ahead in development and thereby rapidly surpass other advanced-level militaries.

The Central Military Commission is a leading and commanding organ to China’s armed forces. Formally, there are the CCP CMC and the People’s Republic of China CMC. However, each consists


-----

inaccurate explanations or refuse to admit facts regarding
Chinese military activities have been confirmed, inciting
concerns over China’s military decision-making and
actions. For example, the submerged transit of a Chinese
Navy submarine through Japan’s contiguous zone around
the Senkaku Islands was confirmed in January 2018, but
China did not acknowledge this. In the same way, in
the cases of submarines in the contiguous zone around
Amami Oshima Island presumed to belong to China
confirmed in June 2020 and September 2021, China did
not acknowledge this fact. On the contrary, there were
some Chinese media reports that criticized the Japanese
side by claiming they were making exaggerations.
Similarly, explanations that stoke concerns about
Chinese military decision-making and actions are also
evident in comments about the South China Sea, where
China is seeking to unilateral changes to the status quo
by force and to create a fait accompli, including through
militarization. At the press conference after the U.S.China summit meeting in September 2015, President
Xi Jinping stated “China does not have any intention
to pursue militarization” in the South China Sea, but in
February 2016, then Foreign Minister Wang Yi described
the facilities in the South China Sea as “necessary
self-defense facilities” that China was developing in
accordance with international law. In 2017, reports in
official media asserted that China had rationally expanded
the area of its “islands and reefs” in the South China Sea
to “strengthen the necessary military defense.”
China’s influence in the international community
has risen politically, economically, and militarily. It has
become increasingly important for China to improve
its transparency regarding defense policies and military
affairs, provide fact-based explanations about its
activities, and share and observe international rules as
a responsible country in the international community
to allay concerns about China. It is strongly hoped that
China will increase transparency through such efforts as
specific and accurate information disclosure.

announced national defense budget recorded a doubledigit increase almost every year between FY1989
and FY2015. The nominal size of China’s announced
national defense budget grew approximately 37-fold in
the 30 years from FY1993 and approximately 2.2-fold in
the 10 years from FY2013. China positions the buildup
of defense capabilities as important a task as economic
development. It is believed that China has continued
to invest resources in the improvement of its defense
capabilities in tandem with its economic development.
However, there have been many years in which the
announced annual national defense budget increase rate
exceeded the economic growth (an increase in gross
domestic product). Attention is to be paid to how the
slowdown in China’s economic growth would affect its
national defense budget.
In addition, it is noted that the amount of the
announced defense budget is considered to be only a
part of its actual military expenditures. For example,
it is believed that the announced defense budget does
not include foreign equipment procurement costs or
research and development (R&D) expenses. According
to an analysis of the U.S. DoD, actual defense spending
in FY2021 was significantly higher than the announced
national defense budget.[7]

As for a breakdown of the national defense budget,
past defense white papers specified personnel, training
and sustainment, and equipment expenses for the
announced national defense budgets for FY2007,
FY2009 and FY2010-2017 (and expenses for active,
reserve and militia forces for FY2007 and FY2009).
However, no more details have been given.

The PAP is designed to engage mainly in patrol,
emergency response, counterterrorism, maritime rights
protection and law enforcement, emergency rescue,
defense operations, etc. The militia is planned to
engage in economic construction, etc., in peacetime and
undertake logistic support missions in an emergency.

**(1) Military Reforms**

In recent years, China has been carrying out military
reforms seen as the largest in its history. In November
2015, Chairman Xi unveiled China’s official position on
a specific direction of the military reforms for the first
time, announcing that the military reforms would be
carried out by 2020.
By the end of 2016, the so-called “above-the-neck”
reforms in the center of the military were reported
to have basically been completed. Specifically, they
abolished the PLA’s seven Military Regions and created
five new Theaters with primary responsibility for
command of operations, namely, the Eastern Theater,
Southern Theater, Western Theater, Northern Theater,
and Central Theater. In addition, they also formed the
PLA Army (PLAA) Headquarters-ranked equally with
the PLA Navy (PLAN) and PLA Air Force (PLAAF)


Headquarters-, the Rocket Force (PLARF), the Strategic
Support Force (PLASSF), and the Joint Logistics
Support Force. Moreover, the headquarters for the entire
PLA were replaced by 15 functional sections under the
CMC, including the Joint Staff Department, Political
Work Department, Logistics Support Department, and
Equipment Development Department. Since 2017,
military reforms have been making steady progress
with the start of what are called full-scale “below-theneck” military reforms at the field level. For example,
the expansion of the Navy Marine Corps, whose
missions include amphibious landing operations,
has been confirmed along with the unification of PAP
leadership and command system under the CMC, and the
reorganization of 18 Group Armies into 13, a reduction
of 300,000 soldiers, the transfer of the coast guard to the
PAP, etc.
It is considered that these series of reforms are
designed to build more practical military forces by
improving their joint operational capabilities and
strengthening the military’s readiness, including the
development of military capabilities and organizational
management in peacetime. In addition, it has been noted
that the reorganization of the headquarters is a means
of tackling corruption at the center of the military by
decentralizing the leading organs. Persons close to and
deeply trusted by Xi Jinping are actively appointed


-----

as members of the CMC; for example, Zhang Youxia
remained in his position as Vice Chairman of the CMC
in the 1st Plenary Session after the 20th CCP Congress
held in October 2022. Given these points, it is thought
that Chairman Xi is attempting to further enhance his
leadership in the CMC and the military.

**(2) Nuclear and Missile Forces**
China has continued independent efforts to develop
nuclear weapons and missiles for their delivery since
the mid-1950s, indicating its apparent attempt to ensure
nuclear deterrence, supplement its conventional forces
with nuclear capabilities and secure its influence on
the international community. It is regarded that China’s
nuclear strategy is to deter any nuclear attack on its
territory by maintaining a nuclear force structure able to
conduct retaliatory nuclear attacks on a limited number
of targets such as cities in adversary countries, should
China be subject to nuclear attacks. China has explained
that it is committed to “no first use” of nuclear weapons
under any circumstances, to “unconditional negative
security assurance” that it would not use or threaten to
use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states
or nuclear-weapon-free zones unconditionally, and to
keeping its nuclear capabilities at the minimum level
required for national security. In recent years, however,
doubts have been expressed about the explanation.[8]
Furthermore, the United States has been inviting China
to participate in the framework of the New START Treaty
(New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty), with the upper
limit of strategic nuclear forces determined between the
United States and Russia, but China has consistently
been denying its participation.
China is viewed as having given priority to
conventional missile capabilities since the 1990s
because of the growing significance of precisionstrike capabilities in the global military trend. China is
aiming to modernize, diversify, and expand its nuclear
capabilities. It is investing in and increasing the number
of means to deliver nuclear weapons by land, sea, and air.
It has been pointed out that China’s operational nuclear
warheads stockpile surpassed 400 in 2021 and China will
likely field a stockpile of about 1500 warheads by 2035
if China continues the pace of its nuclear expansion.[9] It is


believed that China plans to strengthen deterrence against
the United States, and will continue to place importance
on nuclear and missile capabilities in the future.
China possesses ballistic missiles of various types
and ranges, including ICBMs, SLBMs, intermediaterange ballistic missiles (IRBMs), medium-range ballistic
missiles (MRBMs), and short-range ballistic missiles
(SRBMs). The update of China’s ballistic missile forces
from a liquid propellant system to a solid propellant
system is improving their survivability and readiness.
Moreover, it is believed that China is working to
increase their performance by such means as extending
ranges, improving targeting accuracy, and employing
maneuverable reentry vehicles (MaRVs) and multiple
independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs).
China’s main ICBMs, its strategic nuclear asset, had
been the fixed-site liquid-propellant DF-5 missiles.
However, China has in recent years deployed the DF31, which is a mobile-type ICBM with a solid propellant
system mounted onto a transporter erector launcher
(TEL). China is developing the new DF-41 ICBM, which
is viewed to be able to fly up to approximately 11,200 km
and carry 10 warheads. It made its first appearance in
the military parade to mark the 70th anniversary of the
founding of the People’s Republic of China in October
2019. Also, it is pointed out that China continues
building ICBM silos, and that the number of new ICBM
silos reached at least 300 in 2021.[10]

With regard to submarine-launched ballistic missiles
(SLBM), it is considered that Jin-class Nuclear-Powered
Ballistic Missile Submarines (SSBN) equipped with
**JL-2 SLBMs with an estimated range of approximately**
7,200 km are operational. It is believed that China’s
strategic nuclear capabilities will improve significantly
through nuclear deterrence patrols using the Jin-class
SSBNs. Furthermore, it is pointed out that JL-3 extended
range SLBMs reportedly with the range of 12,000 km
have already been loaded into the Jing class SSBNs.
China’s missile forces have been put outside the
framework of the U.S.-Russia Intermediate-range
Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, and China holds numerous
amounts of ground-launched missiles with ranges
between 500 and 5,500 km that had been subjected to
the INF treaty. It is also deemed that China is ahead of

the United States in relation to ground-launched ballistic
missiles and cruise missiles.[11] As for the IRBMs/
MRBMs covering the Indo-Pacific region including
Japan, China has the mobile solid-propellant DF-21
and DF-26, which can be transported and operated on
TELs. These are viewed as capable of carrying both
conventional and nuclear warheads. China possesses
ballistic missiles carrying conventional warheads with
high targeting accuracy based on the DF-21, including
the DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile (ASBM), called
“carrier killer,” which carries conventional warheads


to attack overwater ships including aircraft carriers.
The DF-26, which has a range including Guam and is
called “Guam killer,” is considered a “second-generation
ASBM” developed on the basis of the DF-21D. It was
announced in April 2018 that the DF-21D had “formally
joined the order of battle.” China also possesses the CJ20 (CJ-10) long-range land-attack cruise missile with a
range of at least 1,500 km, as well as the H-6 bomber that
is capable of carrying this cruise missile. It is deemed
that these missiles complement ballistic missile forces,
covering the Indo-Pacific region including Japan. In the
military parade to celebrate the 70th anniversary of its
founding in October 2019, CJ-100/DF-100, which is
said to be a supersonic cruise missile, also made its first
public appearance. The deployment of these ASBMs
and cruise missiles is expected to strengthen China’s
“A2/AD” capabilities. Concerning SRBMs, China has
deployed a large number of solid-propellant DF-16, DF15, and DF-11 missiles facing Taiwan. It is believed that
their ranges cover a part of Japan’s Southwestern Islands
including the Senkaku Islands.
Furthermore, China is believed to be rapidly
developing several HGVs that would be launched with
ballistic missiles to penetrate missile defenses. Their
flight tests have reportedly been conducted since 2014.
In the military parade to mark the 70th anniversary of
China’s founding in October 2019, the **DF-17 MRBM**
viewed as capable of carrying a hypersonic glide
vehicle made its first public appearance. The U.S. DoD
has pointed out that China began DF-17s operations in
2020 and some older SRBMs may be replaced with DF17.[12] In August 2018, China is believed to have tested
a hypersonic vehicle featuring the “waverider” design.
Furthermore, China conducted its first orbital launch
of an ICBM carrying a hypersonic glide vehicle in July
2021. The vehicle reportedly flew approximately 40,000
km in over 100 minutes, and did not strike its target, but
came close.[13]

HGVs have evolved remarkably. It has been pointed
out that multiple warheads can be attached to the
aforementioned new ICBM, the DF-41, and that China
is testing an intercontinental range HGV. Furthermore,
it has been pointed out that it is highly likely that the
launch vehicle is derived from the DF-41. It will not only
be capable of significantly extending the effective range

of HGVs compared to the DF-17, but will also be capable
of carrying larger, heavier hypersonic glide vehicles.
These vehicles are said to be more difficult for missiles
to intercept because they fly low at very high speeds and
are highly maneuverable.
China also seems to be making efforts to develop
missile defense technologies, such as the HQ-19 ballistic
missile defense system. It is believed that China has
been conducting missile interceptor tests in the midcourse phase since 2010. The most recent test was in
February 2021. It has been pointed out that this is an
attempt to acquire capabilities to respond to IRBMs and
other missiles.[14] In addition, in May 2019, two S-400
surface-to-air missile systems introduced from Russia
were reportedly deployed near Beijing. In October of
the same year, Russian President Putin stated that Russia
was helping China build a “missile-attack early warning
system.” Furthermore, the U.S. DoD has pointed out that
China likely has at least three early warning satellites in
orbit as of 2022.[15]


Given that ballistic missile defense technology has the
potential to be applied to missiles capable of destroying
satellites, attention will focus on future Chinese missile
defense trends.

**(3) Ground Forces**
China has the third largest ground forces in the world,
following India and North Korea, with approximately
970,000 personnel. China has sought to improve the
operational capabilities of ground forces pursuing the
downsizing, multifunctionality, and modularization of
military units. Specifically, it is believed to be improving
ground forces’ mobility using measures such as shifting
from theater defense to trans-theater mobility and
working to motorize and mechanize infantry units.
It is said that the Navy Marine Corps is still in the
process of reinforcement. It is reportedly acquiring
equipment and conducting training necessary to become

an expeditionary force. On the other hand, it repeatedly
conducts training for amphibious operation including
using civilian RORO vesseles.[16] It is also pointed out
that these activities suggest that Navy Marine Corps
troops are to be flexibly utilized in multiple roles in a
scenario surrounding Taiwan.[17]

China has annually conducted Stride, Firepower, and
Sharp Sword maneuver-exercises that cut across multiple
regions. They are aiming at verifying and improving the
capabilities necessary to deploy army troops to remote
areas, such as long-distance maneuvering capabilities
of the Army, and logistical support capabilities that
include mobilizing militias and public transportation.
China has also conducted combined military branch
and service exercises under Joint Action since 2014.
Furthermore, it has been reported that force-on-force
training has been frequently conducted to improve
practical operational capabilities. The U.S. DoD pointed
out that PLA Army continued to emphasize joint training
in 2021, and conducted new types of exercises such as
coastal defense, sea crossing, and landing exercises, in
addition to conventional training.[18] These facts suggest
China’s attempt to improve its practical joint operational
capabilities.
The above described PAP consists of internal security
corps, which are organized and established based


on administrative divisions such as provinces and
autonomous regions, mobile corps, which do not have
fixed areas in charge and perform missions across different
areas, and the Coast Guard, described later, which is said
to safeguard national sovereignty, security, and maritime
interests as well as implements law enforcement. The
PAP is said to own various equipment such as armored
vehicles, rotary-wing aircraft, and heavy machine guns.
Furthermore, it is reported that the PAP focuses on
maintaining internal security and joint operations with
the PLA, and is developing capabilities for readiness,
mobility and counter-terrorism operations.[19]

See Fig. I-3-2-4 (Deployment of the People’s Liberation Army (image))

**(4) Naval Forces**
The naval forces consist of three fleets: North Sea Fleet,
East Sea Fleet, and South Sea Fleet. China’s naval
forces, which own a larger scale of ships exceeding
the U.S. Navy and are said to be the largest navy in the
world,[20] are rapidly modernizing. The Chinese Navy
promotes the mass production of its indigenous Yuanclass submarines with improved quietness, as well
as surface combatant ships such as Jiangkai II-class
frigates with improved air defense and anti-ship attack
capabilities. Furthermore, at least eight Renhai-class
destroyers, the largest destroyer class in the PLA Navy,


16 Roll-on-Roll-off ships. Generally, ships to which vehicles loaded with cargo are driven aboard on their own wheels, that can be transported with cargo.

have been commissioned by April 2023. The Renhaiclass destroyer is said to be equipped with a vertical
launch system (VLS) with 112 launch cells, almost twice
the number of launch cells as the new Luyang III-class
destroyer. This VLS is said to be capable of launching
long-range land-attack cruise missiles and YJ-18 antiship cruise missiles with a supersonic terminal attack
capability, as well as ASBMs. It has also been pointed
out that the destroyer is being considered as a launch
vehicle to defend against ballistic missiles in the midcourse phase,[21] and that this suggests a plan for capability
of carrying anti-ship HGVs. The destroyer could be key
for the Chinese Navy’s long-range missile capabilities
in the future. Large landing ships and supply ships also
are increasing. For example, Yushen-class (Type-075)
large landing ships have been launched in succession
since September 2019, with “Hainan” commissioned
in the Southern Theater Command in April 2021, the
second ship in the class, “Guangxi,” commissioned in
the Eastern Theater Command in October 2021, and the
third, “Anhui,” is believed to have been commissioned
already. Furthermore, it has been pointed out that Type076 landing ships may be built following on from the


Yushen-class landing ships. Since September 2017,
Fuyu-class fast combat support ships (comprehensive
supply ships) have been in operation for replenishment
for the aircraft carrier group.
China’s first aircraft carrier Liaoning has been in
action in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, and
the Pacific Ocean since its commission in September
2012. China’s first indigenous aircraft carrier (its
second carrier) was launched in April 2017, and then
it was named “Shandong” and commissioned in Sanya
of Hainan Island in December 2019. The “Shandong,”
with a ski-jump flight deck, is an improved version of
the “Liaoning,” reportedly carrying a greater number of
aircraft than the “Liaoning.” China is reportedly building
its second indigenous **aircraft carrier “Fujian,” its third**
carrier, which could be equipped with an electromagnetic
catapult system to operate fixed-wing early warning
aircraft. It has also been pointed out that China has plans
to build nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.
China is believed to have been developing and
deploying unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) and
unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) that are
available for military purposes. Such equipment, though


-----

being relatively cheap, are viewed as representing an
asymmetric force to effectively prevent adversaries from
winning maritime supremacy, particularly underwater
supremacy.
Given these developments concerning the naval forces,
China appears to be steadily building up capabilities for
conducting operations in more distant waters in addition
to near sea defense. It has also been pointed out that in
the near future, the PLA Navy will have the capability
to make long-range precision strikes against land targets
using land-attack cruise missiles from submarines and
surface combatant ships, and its anti-submarine warfare
(ASW) capabilities of surface combatants and fixed and
rotary wing aircrafts are significantly improved, while it
continues to lack a robust deep-water ASW capability.[22]
It is necessary to continue to monitor the related
developments.
The PAP, one of the China’s armed forces other than
the military, has the Coast Guard under its umbrella, one
of whose missions is the protection of maritime interests.
The Coast Guard consists of three groups: North, East
and South Sea Sub-bureaus. Chinese government
ships belonging to the Coast Guard have recently been
designed to be larger and armed. At the end of December
2022, the China Coast Guard possessed 157 ships[23] with
full displacement of 1,000 tons or more, including two
10,000-ton-class patrol ships, among the world’s largest
ones. The vessels equipped with a gun-like armament
were observed as well. It is pointed out that the newer
ships are significantly larger and more capable than older
ships, and are equipped with helicopter facilities, highcapacity water cannons, guns ranging from 20mm to


76mm, and other equipment, so that they are viewed as
being able to withstand long-term operations and engage
in distant-water activities.[24]

The enhanced cooperation between the PLA and the
China Coast Guard has also been confirmed. In July
2018, the China Coast Guard that had been conducting
maritime surveillance operation under the direction
of the State Council’s Ministry of Public Security
was transferred to the PAP under unified control and
command of the CMC and renamed PAP Coast Guard.
After the transfer, former naval officers were reportedly
given major Coast Guard posts, indicating enhanced
cooperation between the military and Coast Guard. It
has been noted that retired naval destroyers and frigates
were delivered to the Coast Guard, suggesting that the
military has been supporting the Coast Guard in terms
of equipment as well as personnel. It has been pointed
out that the military forces and the Coast Guard have
conducted joint exercises. The enhanced cooperation
between the PLA and the PAP including the Coast Guard
is believed to be intended to steadily strengthen their
joint operational capabilities through the enhancement
of cooperation.
Amid such a situation, in June 2020, “Law of the
People’s Republic of China in the People’s Armed
Police Force (PAP Law) was revised, and “protection
of maritime interests and law enforcement” were
added to the duties of the PAP. The revised version also
stipulates that the PAP shall be centrally and uniformly
guided by the Central Committee and the CMC of the
People’s Republic of China. In the revision of this law,
the duty of “protection of the maritime interests and law
enforcement” was supposed to be stipulated separately
by law. However, the Coast Guard Law of the People’s
Republic of China (Coast Guard Law), which stipulates
the Coast Guard’s responsibilities and authority
including the use of weapons, was newly enacted in
January 2021 and entered into force in February 2021.
A Spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign
Affairs explains that the establishment of the CCG Law
is merely a normal legislative activity of the National
People’s Congress and that China’s maritime policy has
not changed. However, the Coast Guard Law includes
problematic provisions in terms of their inconsistency
with international law. Sources of inconsistency include,

China’s air forces consist mainly of the Navy’s air units
and the Air Force. As for fourth-generation fighters,
China has introduced from Russia the Su-27 and Su-30


25 In addition, it is pointed out that while the maritime militia often rents fishing vessels from companies or individual fishermen, China has built a state-owned fishing fleet in the South China Sea for
the maritime militia. It is also pointed out that the Hainan provincial government, adjacent to the South China Sea, ordered the building of 84 large militia fishing vessels with reinforced hulls and
ammunition storage, which the militia received by the end of 2016, along with extensive subsidies to encourage frequent operations in the Spratly Islands. Since this maritime militia unit recruits

long-endurance (HALE) UAVs for reconnaissance and
other purposes as well as those capable of carrying
weapons such as missiles. Some of these are deployed
and actively exported. In fact, it is suggested that the
Chinese Air Force has created a UAV unit for attack
missions and frequently used UAVs for reconnaissance
and other purposes in waters and airspace surrounding
China. Several unmanned vehicles such as the FH97A which is reported to be operative in supporting
manned fighters, and the unmanned reconnaissance/
attack vehicle WL-3 which is reported to have a range of
over 10,000 km were first shown publicly at the China
International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition held in
November 2022. Moreover, it has been noted that China
is improving “Swarm” technology to operate a large
number of small low-cost UAVs.
Given such modernization of the air forces, it is
believed that China is steadily improving not only its
defense capabilities for its national airspace but also
capabilities for conducting combat operations, and
supporting ground and maritime forces in more distant
areas.

and the Su-35 latest fourth-generation fighter. China is
also developing its own domestic modern fighters. China
has started the mass production of the J-11B fighter,
a suspected copy of the Su-27, and the J-16 fighter, a
suspected copy of the Su-30, as well as the domestic
J-10 fighter. The J-15 fighter aboard the aircraft carrier
“Liaoning” is viewed as a copy of the Russian Su-33.
China is deploying **J-20 fifth-generation fighters and**
developing J-31 (J-35) fighter. It has been pointed out
that J-31 (J-35) fighter could be the base for developing
the replacement for the J-15 carrier-based fighter.
As China is continuing the modernization of its
bombers as well, the Air Force has increased the number
of **H-6 bombers, which are believed to be capable of**
carrying long-range land-attack cruise missiles with
nuclear capability. In an attempt to improve bombers’
long-range operation capabilities, the Air Force has
reportedly begun to operate H-6N bombers that can take
advantage of aerial refueling to fly longer. It is believed
to be developing a new long-range stealth bomber called
H-20. It is also pointed out that China is developing an
air-launched ballistic missile with nuclear capability to
be carried by such bombers. Moreover, it has also been
pointed out that China is developing a stealth bomber.
China is also making continuous efforts to improve
capabilities which are essential for operations of modern
air power by introducing the H-6U and IL-78M aerial
refueling tankers and the KJ-500 and KJ-2000 early
warning and control aircraft. Since July 2016, China has
promoted the deployment of the indigenously developed
Y-20 large transport aircraft. The Y-20U, an aerial
refueling tanker based on this transport aircraft, has also
been deployed since June 2021.

space and cyberspace have become new commanding
heights (capture point) in strategic competition among all
parties,” indicating that it has recognized the importance
of taking on information mastery in wartime when it
must protect its own information systems and networks
while neutralizing those of its adversaries. In fact, the
PLASSF established at the end of 2015 apparently takes
charge of outer space, cyberspace, and electronic warfare
missions for intelligence support for all military forces.
It is pointed out that China actively utilizes outer
space for military purpose, and given that administrative
organizations and state-owned enterprises involved in
the use of outer space in China are pointed out as having
close cooperative ties with the military, it is considered


that China is planning to improve its capabilities for
military operations in outer space.[26] China is said to
have developed its space program in the shortest time
in the world. Specifically, China has rapidly increased
the number of satellites available for military purposes in
recent years. For example, the “BeiDou” global satellite
positioning system, which is called a Chinese-version
GPS and pointed out as available for ballistic missiles
and other guided weapons systems, started its global
operation service in late 2018, and it is deemed that the
launch of all satellites constituting the BeiDou system
was completed in June 2020.
As for the cyber domain, it has been noted that current
major military training of China always contains cyber


-----

operations covering both attacks on and defense of
command systems. Cyber attacks on enemy networks
are likely to bolster China’s “A2/AD” capabilities. The
militia as a part of China’s armed forces reportedly
includes “cyber militias” with excellent cyber domain
capabilities.
With regard to electromagnetic spectrum domain, the
presence of aircraft with electronic warfare capabilities
has been noted. Y-8 electronic warfare aircraft, which
frequently fly near Japan, are pointed out along with J-15
carrier-based fighters, J-16 fighters and H-6 bombers
that appear to be equipped with electronic warfare pod
systems giving them electronic warfare capabilities.

**(7) China’s “Intelligentization” of its Military Forces**
The “intelligentized warfare” advocated by China is
described as “integrated warfare waged in land, sea, air,
space, electromagnetic, cyber, and cognitive domains
using intelligentized weaponry and equipment and
their associated operational methods underpinned by
the IoT information systems”. The “cognitive domain”
is believed to be recognized as important in the future
aspects of warfare.
Also, in respect of “intelligentized warfare,” it is
pointed out that the PLA
-  has recognized that new technologies will increase
the speed and tempo of future warfare, and that
operationalization of AI will be necessary to improve
the speed and quality of information processing
by reducing battlefield uncertainty and providing
decision making advantage over potential adversaries.
-  is exploring next-generation operational concepts for
intelligentized warfare, such as attrition warfare using
intelligentized swarms.
-  considers unmanned systems to be important
intelligentized technologies, and is pursuing greater
autonomy for unmanned land, sea, and air assets to
enable swarm attacks, optimized logistics support,
as well as dispersed intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance (ISR) operations.[27]


Command Center is believed to have been established
under the initiatives for the CCP to carry out decision
making at the highest strategic level. The five new theaters
established in February 2016 are seen as representing
permanent joint operation headquarters. Attention
will be focused to movement towards integration in
personnel affairs as well; for example, General He
Weidong who has experienced as a commanding
officer of a joint force as Commander of the Eastern
Theater Command was assigned as Vice Chairman
of the Central Military Commission in October 2022.
In recent years, China has implemented joint service
trainings giving priority to practicality and other drills
to improve its joint operational capabilities. These drills
are apparently designed to secure the effectiveness of
the abovementioned organizational reforms and other
initiatives to improve joint operational capabilities.
Xi Jinping stated in his report in the 20th CCP Congress
held in October 2022 that China will optimize the
command system for joint operations, intensify military
training under combat conditions, and lay emphasis on
joint training. Given these remarks, the abovementioned
moves towards joint operations are expected to progress
further.

**6 Maritime and Airspace Activities**


**Part**
**Ⅰ**

**Chapter**


**(1) General Situation**
Recently, China is believed to be aiming to build up
capabilities for operations in more distant waters and
airspace, including those to project power to waters
including the so-called second island chain, beyond
the first island chain. In such efforts, China has rapidly
expanded and intensified its activities in the maritime and
aerial domains using its naval and air powers. In waters
and airspace surrounding Japan, particularly, Chinese
naval vessels, and naval and air force aircraft suspected as
conducting training and information gathering activities
have been observed frequently, along with Chinese
naval ships heading for the Pacific and Indian Ocean
and numerous China Coast Guard vessels operating
under the name of protecting maritime interests. Their
activities include China Coast Guard vessels’ intermittent
intrusions into Japan’s territorial waters, and dangerous
acts that could cause unintended consequences, such
as the directing of fire-control radar at Japanese Self

**(8) Efforts to Develop Comprehensive Operational**
**Capabilities**

In recent years, initiatives have been under way to
improve joint operational capabilities in areas from
the front line to logistics. The CMC Joint Operations


-----

Defense Forces (SDF) ships and aircrafts, 28 Chinese
military fighters’ abnormally close approach to Japanese
SDF and U.S. military aircraft, and the establishment
of the “East China Sea ADIZ” and other activities that
could infringe upon the freedom of overflight. These
activities have become a grave matter of concern and
are very deplorable. Furthermore, flying objects that
were confirmed within Japanese territorial airspace
are strongly presumed to be unmanned reconnaissance
balloons flown by China. In the South China Sea, China
is moving forward with militarization, expanding and
intensifying its activities in the air and sea space in the
area, and creating a fait accompli of unilateral changes
to the status quo by force. It is strongly hoped that China
will act on the basis of the principle of the rule of law
and play active roles in the region and the international
community in a more cooperative manner.

**(2) Military Activities in Japan’s Surrounding Waters**
**and Airspace**

The Chinese Navy and Air Force have in recent
years expanded and intensified their activities in the
surrounding sea areas and airspace of Japan, including the
area surrounding the Senkaku Islands. These activities
include those allegedly based on China’s unilateral claim
on the Senkaku Islands, and cases involving the onesided escalation of activities, creating a situation of great
concern to Japan. The Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF)
has continued to make frequent scrambles against
Chinese aircraft, as indicated by an all-time high of 851
scrambles in FY2016. China has also continued naval
ships’ passage through waters near Japan for navigation
to distant waters such as the Indian Ocean, as well as
activities viewed as training of maritime and air forces
making forays to the Pacific and the Sea of Japan.
It appears that China continues to improve the
complexity of its activities in recent years. Given that
Chinese efforts are also seen to improve practical joint
operational capabilities, Chinese military activities
in Japan’s surrounding waters and airspace should be
closely watched with grave attention.
a. Activities in the East China Sea (including the Areas
around the Senkaku Islands)
Chinese naval vessels have been conducting operations
in the East China Sea continuously and actively. Stating


its own position regarding Japan s Senkaku Islands,
China claims that patrols by Chinese naval vessels
in the sea areas under its jurisdiction are completely
justifiable and lawful. Chinese naval vessels have been
continuously operating in the areas near Japan’s Senkaku
Islands. In June 2016, a Jiangkai I-class frigate became
the first ever Chinese Navy combatant vessel to enter
Japan’s contiguous zone around the Senkaku Islands.
Furthermore, in January 2018, a Shang-class submerged
submarine and a Jiangkai II-class frigate passed into
the contiguous zone around the Senkaku Islands on the
same day. This was the first time a Chinese submarine was
identified and announced as conducting submerged transit
through the contiguous waters off the Senkaku Islands. In
June 2020 and September 2022, submerged transit of a
submarine presumed to belong to China was confirmed in
the contiguous zone surrounding Amami Oshima Island.
In recent years, Chinese Navy intelligence gathering
vessels (AGIs) have also been found conducting
activities in multiple cases. A Chinese Navy Dongdiaoclass AGI repeatedly navigated back and forth outside
of the contiguous zone south of the Senkaku Islands in
November 2015. In June 2016, an AGI of the same type
sailed in Japan’s territorial waters near Kuchinoerabujima
Island and Yakushima Island, and then passed Japan’s
contiguous zone north of Kitadaitojima Island.
Subsequently, the vessel repeatedly conducted eastwest passages outside the contiguous zone south of the
Senkaku Islands. .
A Jiangwei II-class frigate entered the contiguous
zone southwest of Uotsurishima Island in July 2022.
Furthermore, a PLA Navy Shupang-class survey
ship sailed through Japan’s territorial waters near
Kuchinoerabujima Island, Kuchinoshima Island, and
Yakushima Island in November 2021, in April, July,
September, November, and December 2022 as well as
in February 2023.
PLA Air Force aircraft are also actively conducting
actions in the East China Sea including air space near the
Senkaku Islands on a routine basis. Their activities are
thought to include warning and surveillance, combat air
patrols (CAPs), and training. Chinese military aircraft
have recently become more active in airspace closer
to Japan’s Southwestern Islands. Their activities have
possibly been intended to operate the “East China Sea

28 In January 2013, a Chinese naval vessel directed a fire-control radar at a Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) destroyer navigating on the high seas of the East China Sea on January 30. Moreover,
it is believed that other Chinese naval vessel directed a fire-control radar at a helicopter mounted on an MSDF destroyer on January 19. Projecting fire-control radar is normally conducted prior to


-----

ADIZ. Moreover, actions of UAVs are activated; for
example, aerial unmanned reconnaissance/attack vehicle
TB-001, aerial unmanned reconnaissance vehicles BZK005 and WZ-7 flew past alone in the air space between
the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima Island
in July and August 2022, and in January 2023, one
presumed Chinese UAV flew from the East China Sea,
after passing south, and flew off in the direction of the
continent in November 2022.
b. Advancements into the Pacific Ocean
Chinese Navy combatant vessels continue to transit
the waters near Japan to advance into the Pacific
Ocean and return to base with high frequency. The
advancement routes are multiplying. Chinese naval
vessels have been confirmed as transiting the sea area
between the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima
Island, and have been found passing through the Osumi
Strait, the sea area between Yonagunijima Island and
Nakanokamishima Island near Iriomotejima Island,
the sea area between Amami Oshima Island and
Yokoatejima Island, the Tsugaru Strait, and the Soya
Strait. Through these activities, China has apparently
attempted to “regularize” naval ships’ advancements
into the Pacific Ocean through waters near Japan and
improve its capabilities for accessing the open ocean
and conducting operations there. In December 2016,
the aircraft carrier “Liaoning” navigated the East China
Sea together with other vessels and passed the sea area
between the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima
Island to advance to the Pacific for the first time. After
that, Liaoning also went into the Pacific Ocean with other
ships in April 2018, June 2019, April 2020, and in April
and December 2021, and in May and December 2022.
It was observed that Liaoning navigated from the South
China Sea passing through the Bashi Channel, and from
the East China Sea passing through sea area between the
main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima Island to the
Pacific Ocean. Also, during navigations of the fleet that
includes aircraft carrier Liaoning, landings and takeoffs
of carrier-based fighters and other aircraft in the Pacific
Ocean were frequently observed. Furthermore, the
actions of aircraft carrier Shandong including landings
and takeoffs of fighters in the Pacific were observed for
the first time in April 2023.
The activities are worthy of attention as indicating the
enhancement of the capabilities of China’s naval forces,


including the aircraft carrier, and the improvement of its
capabilities to project power to more distant areas.
Regarding air forces, the advancement of a PLAN Y-8
early warning aircraft into the Pacific Ocean, passing
between the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima
Island, was confirmed for the first time in July 2013.
The advancement of Air Force aircraft into the Pacific
was also confirmed in 2015. Since 2017, advances into
the Pacific Ocean via this airspace have become more
active. The types of aircraft passing through the airspace
have also diversified year by year. H-6K bombers and
Su-30 fighters were confirmed by 2016 and the Y-8 EW
aircraft in July 2017. At least one bomber was confirmed
as carrying objects in the form of missiles. The U.S.
DoD has pointed out that such Chinese bomber flights
indicated the Chinese forces’ training targeting the
United States and its allies.[29] Flight patterns of Chinese
military aircraft have also been changing. Flights from
the East China Sea to the Pacific Ocean, passing between
the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima Island, and
from the direction of the Bashi Channel to the Pacific
Ocean, both with the return trips on the same shuttle
routes, have been repeatedly made. Since November
2016, H-6K bombers and other aircraft were confirmed
as flying around Taiwan. In August 2017, H-6K bombers
were confirmed as flying to waters off the Kii Peninsula
after advancing to the Pacific Ocean via waters between the
main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima Island for the first
time. Through frequent long-distance flights of bombers
and other aircraft, including advancements to the Pacific,
and their advanced flight paths and composition, China
is thought to be demonstrating its presence around areas
including those surrounding Japan, and planning further
enhancements to more practical operational capabilities.
Additionally, activities considered planned to improve
sea and air joint operational capabilities in more distant
areas, such as what seemed to be air-to-ship attack drills
including advancements to the Pacific Ocean, have been
seen in recent years. China is expected to further expand
and intensify naval and air activities in the Pacific Ocean.
c. Activities in the Sea of Japan
While the Chinese Navy has been active in the Sea
of Japan during training and on other occasions for
some time, its Air Force activities in the area have also
intensified of late. “Force-on-force trainings” in the Sea
of Japan by Chinese Navy ships were announced for

the first time in August 2016. Three aircraft apparently
participated in the trainings, including two H-6 bombers
that passed through the Tsushima Strait into the Sea of
Japan for the first time.
In December 2017, Chinese Air Force aircraft (H6K bombers) passed through the Tsushima Strait and
advanced to the Sea of Japan. Then, Chinese fighter
aircraft (Su-30 fighters) were confirmed as advancing to
the Sea of Japan for the first time. In February 2018, it
was confirmed for the first time that the Y-9 intelligence
gathering aircraft entered the Sea of Japan via the Western
Channel of Tsushima Strait (the strait between Tsushima
in Nagasaki Prefecture and the Korean Peninsula). The
PLA conducted five joint flights of bombers with Russia
from 2019 to 2022; in every case, the bombers flew over
the Sea of Japan, and a case in which PLA aircraft passed
through Russian airspace and moved into Sea of Japan
directly was observed. In regard to sea power, AGIs
passing through Tsushima Strait have been frequently
observed in recent years.
Since 2018, China’s sea and air forces have further
intensified activities in the Sea of Japan involving
passages through the Tsushima Strait. It is considered
that the PLA will continue to expand and intensify its
activities in the Sea of Japan.

**(3) Activities of Chinese Ships Including Coast**
**Guard Vessels, and Aircraft around the Senkaku**
**Islands, etc.**

China Coast Guard vessels have been seen almost every
day in the contiguous zone of the Senkaku Islands, Japan’s
inherent territory, and repeatedly intruded into Japan’s
territorial waters. Since the activities of China Coast
Guard vessels based on China’s own assertion conducted
in Japan’s territorial waters around the Senkaku Islands
are violating international law in the first place, Japan
has been strongly protesting against these activities and
requested them to leave many times. Despite Japan’s
strong protests, however, Chinese Coast Guard vessels
continued to intrude into the Japanese territorial waters
in FY2022. Almost every month in 2022, China Coast
Guard vessels entered Japan’s territorial waters. Incidents
occurred in which China Coast Guard ships attempted
to approach Japanese fishing boats when those Japanese
boats were navigating in Japanese territorial waters near
the Senkaku Islands. China Coast Guard vessels entered
Japan’s territorial waters around the Senkaku Islands and
stayed there for more than 80 hours the longest period


ever, from the end of March to beginning of April 2023.
Providing the background, in December 2008, China
Maritime Surveillance vessels intruded into Japan’s
territorial waters for the first time and hovered and
drifted, running counter to international law. Later,
China Maritime Surveillance and China Fisheries Law
Enforcement Command vessels gradually intensified
their activities in the Japanese territorial waters. Such
activities have greatly intensified since September 2012,
when the Japanese Government acquired the ownership
of three of the Senkaku Islands (Uotsurishima Island,
Kitakojima Island, and Minamikojima Island). The
number of Chinese government ships intruding into the
Japanese territorial waters in a day had been limited
to two or three until August 2016. Later, however, the
number has reached four frequently.
China is seen to be steadily strengthening an
operational posture intended to use Coast Guard vessels
to intrude into Japan’s territorial waters. Since December
2015, Chinese ships armed with gun-like armament have
repeatedly intruded into the Japanese territorial waters.
Cases indicating the improvement of China Coast
Guard vessels’ operational capabilities have been also
confirmed. From February to July 2021, China Coast
Guard vessels were seen in the contiguous zone of the
Senkaku Islands for a record 157 consecutive days. China
Coast Guard vessels were seen in the contiguous zone of
the Senkaku Islands on 336 days of 2022, the highest
number of days ever. In that year, the total number of
China Coast Guard vessels seen in the zone was 1,201,
which was a high level continuing from 2021.
Additionally, cases indicating China’s capabilities
to send numerous China Coast Guard vessels and
other ships to waters around the Senkaku Islands
simultaneously have also been identified. In early August
2016, approximately 200 to 300 Chinese fishing boats
advanced to the contiguous zone of the Senkaku Islands.
At that time, as many as up to 15 China Coast Guard
vessels and other ships were confirmed in the contiguous
zone simultaneously. Over five days, a large number of
China Coast Guard vessels, other ships, and fishing boats
repeatedly intruded into Japan’s territorial waters.
In December 2012, a fixed-wing aircraft of the
State Oceanic Administration was identified as the
first Chinese aircraft to intrude into Japan’s airspace
around the Senkaku Islands. Until March 2014, aircraft
of the State Oceanic Administration were frequently
confirmed as approaching the airspace In May 2017 it

**(4) Trends of Activities around Taiwan**
China has intensified military activities around Taiwan.
According to announcements from the Ministry of
National Defense of Taiwan, entry into airspace around
Taiwan has been increasing since September 2020. The
total number of aircraft that entered was over 970 in
2021, and that number increased significantly from the
previous year to over 1,700 aircraft in 2022. Furthermore,
the Ministry announced that other aircrafts such as attack
helicopters, air refueling tankers, and UAVs came to
be seen entering the airspace from 2021, in addition to
conventional fighters and bombers.
On August 2, 2022, China announced the setting of
six training areas surrounding Taiwan, and conducting
“a series of integrated military operations” around
Taiwan, in conjunction with the visit of Nancy Pelosi,
Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives (then)
to Taiwan. China launched nine ballistic missiles on
August 4, 2022, five of which were landed within the
Japanese Executive Economic Zone (EEZ), an another
landed at the closest point to Japanese territory, which


was confirmed that an object that appeared to be a small
drone was flying above a China Coast Guard vessel
intruding into the Japanese territorial waters around the
Senkaku Islands. This flight also constitutes an invasion
of Japan’s territorial airspace.
China has thus relentlessly continued attempts to
unilaterally change the status quo by force in the sea area
around the Senkaku Islands, leading to a grave matter of
concern. Japan cannot accept China’s actions to escalate
the situation.

was about 80 km from Yonagunijima Island. This was
perceived as a threat to local residents. In addition, some
of the missiles passed over Taiwan. After that, the PLA
continued the large-scale military exercise covering
subjects such as joint blockage, sea and ground attack,
air superiority combat, and anti-submarine warfare in
air space and sea space around Taiwan for about one
week. It is probable that, in this military exercise, China
may have rehearsed some parts of a Taiwan invasion
operation, such as the blockade of Taiwan, ground/ship
attacks, the acquisition of sea/air superiority in wartime,
and gray-zone situations, including cyber attacks and
“cognitive warfare.”
Furthermore, according to an announcement of the
Taiwanese Ministry of National Defense, PLA aircrafts
repeatedly entered air space east of the China-Taiwan
“median line”[30] over the Taiwan Strait, since the U.S.
Speaker Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan.
In addition, in response to President Tsai Ing-wen’s
meeting with Kevin McCarthy, Speaker of the U.S.
House of Representatives on April 5 (local time), during
her visit to the United States as a stepover for her tour of
Central America in 2023, China conducted large-scale
military exercises in the sea and airspace around Taiwan
from April 8 to 10, involving numerous naval vessels
and aircraft, including the aircraft carrier “Shandong.”
China announced that simulated joint accurate attacks
to important targets in Taiwan and the sea area around
Taiwan and joint blockage by several services were
executed in these exercises. It is viewed that China
may have rehearsed some parts of a Taiwan invasion
operation, following the exercise in August 2022.
It is believed that through the series of activities
around Taiwan, China seeks to create a fait accompli
where the Chinese military is continuously operating,
and improve its actual combat capabilities.

**(5) Trends of Activities in the South China Sea**
China has also been intensifying its activities based on
assertions, which are conflicting with existing laws and
orders of the seas, in the South China Sea, including
waters around the Spratly Islands and the Paracel Islands,
over which territorial disputes exist with neighbors,
including some member states of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).


Since 2014, on seven features of the Spratly Islands
(Fiery Cross Reef, Mischief Reef, Subi Reef, Cuarteron
Reef, Gaven Reefs, Hughes Reef, and Johnson South
Reef), China pressed ahead with large-scale and rapid
land reclamation. The Philippines-China arbitration
award issued in July 2016 denied the “historic rights”
as the basis of the “nine-dash line” claimed by China,
and determined the illegality of China’s activities such
as land reclamation. However, China has made it clear
that it would not comply with the award and is currently
continuing military activities while promoting the
development of military facilities, such as batteries,
and various kinds of infrastructure that can be used for
military purposes, including runways, ports, hangars,
and radar facilities, to militarize these features.
On Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief Reefs, called the
Big Three of the Spratly Islands, China has developed
batteries for anti-aircraft guns, missile shelters,
underground storage facilities pointed out to be
munitions storage, large ports capable of accommodating
combatant ships and runways available for takeoff and
landing of fighters and bombers.
On Fiery Cross Reef in April 2016, a Navy patrol
aircraft flying over the South China Sea landed for a
nominal purpose of evacuating emergency patients. On
Subi and Mischief Reefs in July of the same year, China
forced aircraft test flights on runways available for the
takeoff and landing of large aircraft. Reportedly, there
was confirmation of a Y-7 transport aircraft on Mischief
Reef in January 2018, a Y-8 special mission aircraft on
Subi Reef in April that year, a Y-20 transport airport on
Fiery Cross Reef in December 2020, and a KJ-500 early
warning and control aircraft on Fiery Cross Reef in June
2021. Additionally, in April 2018, it was reported that
anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missiles were
deployed on Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief Reefs for
military training and that radar jamming systems were
deployed on Mischief Reef. Furthermore, it was reported
in May 2020 that China possibly deployed aircraft
including Y-8 patrol and Y-9 early warning aircraft and
other aircraft to the Fiery Cross Reef in rotation.
On the other four features, it is pointed out that the
construction of facilities, such as harbors, helipads, and
radars, has made progress and that what appears to be

also conducted during the exercise period.
In the area surrounding Japan, two Chinese UAVs were
confirmed to have passed between the main island of Okinawa
and Miyakojima Island and engaged in activities over the Pacific
Ocean near Taiwan on August 4, and one presumed Chinese
UAV that flew from the East China Sea was confirmed to have
engaged in activities over the ocean northeast of Taiwan. It is
possible that these activities may have been related to this
military exercise.
From this series of circumstances, it is probable that, in
this military exercise, China may have rehearsed some parts
of a Taiwan invasion operation, such as the blockade of Taiwan, Image of an apparent ballistic missile launch conducted by the Eastern Theater

(CIWS) may have already been deployed. If these
features are used for full-scale military purposes, it
could significantly change the security environment in
the Indo-Pacific region. Furthermore, it was reported
in December 2022 that China is carrying out new
construction activities on another four features of the
Spratly Islands.
China carried out the militarization of the Paracel
Islands before that of the Spratly Islands. China has
reportedly extended the runway to nearly 3,000 m on
Woody Island since 2013. In October 2015, October 2017,
and June 2019, China was reported to have deployed
J-11, J-10 and other fighters on the island. In February
2016 and January 2017, the existence of equipment
likely to be surface-to-air missiles was confirmed. It has
been noted that the takeoff and landing training of the
H-6K bombers in the South China Sea announced by the
Chinese Ministry of National Defense in May 2018 was
carried out on Woody Island.
In recent years, Chinese vessels have allegedly been
conducting what are likely to be survey activities in
Scarborough Shoal, where a standoff took place between
Chinese and Philippine government ships in April
2012. It is pointed out that new land reclamations on
the shoal might be seen in the future. It is also pointed
out that if China conducts land reclamations and installs
radar facilities, runways, and other infrastructure on
Scarborough Shoal, it could possibly increase its ability
for situation awareness and power projection capabilities
in the surrounding sea area and ultimately enhance its
operational capabilities throughout all the areas of the
South China Sea.
Also, it has been pointed out that if China were to
consider bastion operations (fortification) to enhance the
survivability of new types of long-range SLBMs capable
of hitting the U.S. mainland, the South China Sea would
be the suitable choice.[31] Attention must continue to be paid
to the situation in the South China Sea going forward.
The activities in sea and airspace in the area are
expanding and intensifying as well. In March 2009,
December 2013 and September 2018, Chinese naval
and other vessels approached and intercepted U.S. Navy
vessels navigating in the South China Sea. In May 2016,
February 2017 and May 2017, PLA fighters allegedly
flew close to U.S. Forces aircraft. In July and August
2016, after the Philippines-China arbitration award was


rendered, PLAAF H-6K bomber aircraft conducted
“combat air patrol” in the airspace close to Scarborough
Shoal. The Chinese Ministry of National Defense
announced that this patrol would “become normal.” In
December 2016, H-6 bombers reportedly flew along
the so-called nine-dash line. In September of the same
year, the China-Russia bilateral naval exercise “Joint
Sea 2016” was conducted for the first time in the South
China Sea.
A field training exercise by naval vessels including the
aircraft carrier “Liaoning” and a naval review ceremony,
regarded as the largest since the founding of China,
were conducted in the same area from the end of March
until April 2018. In 2019, anti-ship ballistic missile tests
were reportedly conducted in the South China Sea for
the first time. In 2019 and 2020, the deployment of the
aircraft carrier “Liaoning” accompanied by Fuyu-class
fast combat support and other ships in the South China
Sea was reported. Furthermore, China Coast Guard
vessels reportedly fired warning shots at fishing boats of
neighboring countries. When China Coast Guard vessels
interrupted Vietnam’s oil and natural gas development
within its exclusive economic zone from July to October
2019, they reportedly visited Fiery Cross Reef for supply.
In April 2020, China unilaterally announced the
establishment of Xisha (Paracel) District and Nansha
(Spratly) District under Sansha City in the Hainan
province. China conducted simultaneous military
exercises in three sea areas (South China Sea, East China
Sea, and Yellow Sea) in July and is believed to have
launched middle-range ballistic missiles in August 2020.
Furthermore, it was announced that the aircraft carrier
“Shandong” conducted an exercise in the South China
Sea in May 2021, and reported that another exercise was
conducted in early winter of the same year. In June of
the same year, the Malaysian Air Force announced that
16 Chinese military aircraft had flown over the Luconia
Shoal and approached as far as the Malaysian coast.
In addition, in December of the same year, it was also
reported that the aforementioned Yushen-class landing
ships conducted a series of exercises in the South
China Sea, and that exercises were conducted at several
locations on Hainan Island facing the South China Sea.
It was pointed out that the latter exercises in particular
were possibly exercises simulating an amphibious
operation using Hainan Island against Taiwan. It was

in the South China Sea in August 2022.
In this way, it appears that China seeks to expand its
presence and enhance war-sustaining and other joint
operational capabilities including military and other
means in the South China Sea.
Such activities conducted by China based on its own
assertions, which are conflicting with existing laws and
orders of the seas, further advance unilateral changes to
the status quo by force and efforts to create a fait accompli.
Japan is deeply concerned about these activities, and
the concern is shared with the international community,
including the United States and other G7 Member States.
For example, in July 2020, the United States issued a
statement from the U.S. Secretary of State saying that
China’s maritime claims in the South China Sea were
unlawful. In January 2022, the State Department issued
a study stating that China’s unlawful territorial and
jurisdictional claims gravely undermined the rule of law


in the oceans.
China asserts that some of the ASEAN member states
including the Philippines and Vietnam are illegitimately
occupying features. However, China’s development
work on the features is of a scale incomparable to the
activities carried out by other countries and is conducted
at a rapid pace.
In any case, the issues surrounding the South China
Sea are directly related to peace and stability in the IndoPacific region and are a legitimate concern not only for
Japan, which has major sea lanes in the South China Sea,
but also for the entire international community. Countries
concerned, including China, are urged to refrain from
unilateral actions that heighten tension and act on the
basis of the principle of the rule of law.

**(6) Trends in the Indian Ocean and Other More**
**Distant Waters**

The Chinese Navy is considered to be shifting towards
“protection missions on the far seas” and has been
steadily increasing its capabilities to conduct operations
in more distant waters, such as the Indian Ocean, in recent
years. Progress has been seen in the Navy’s development
of such equipment as large combatant ships and
replenishment ships and in its operational initiatives. For
example, since December 2008, Chinese Navy vessels
have been deployed off the coast of Somalia and in the
Gulf of Aden to take part in international counter-piracy
efforts. In March 2023, the Chinese Navy conducted
its third trilateral exercise with its Russian and Iranian
counterparts in the northern Indian Ocean.
Chinese forces have expanded activities not only in
the Indian Ocean but also in other waters. In September
2016, China-Russia “Joint Sea” bilateral naval exercises
took place in waters including the Mediterranean Sea.
Furthermore, Chinese Navy conducted a trilateral
exercise offshore of Durban in eastern South Africa
in February 2023 with its Russian and South African
counterparts for the second time since November 2019.
China has also deployed a space observation support ship
in the southern Pacific and dispatched a military hospital
ship to waters including the southern Pacific as well as
those near Latin America under “Mission Harmony.”
In September 2015, five Chinese military vessels
reportedly sailed in the high seas of the Bering Sea and
in U.S. territorial waters near the Aleutian Islands. China
has deployed the vessels such as the polar research
vessel Xue Long to the Arctic Ocean in total twelve
times since 1999;[32] moreover, in January 2018, China
published a white paper entitled “China’s Arctic Policy,”
which mapped out a policy of active involvement in
Arctic initiatives, including efforts to build a “Polar Silk
Road” through the development of Arctic sea routes. It is
pointed out that China could take advantage of scientific
survey and commercial activities to increase its presence
including military activities in the Arctic sea.[33]

Additionally, China has been remarkably trying to
secure overseas outposts such as harbors, which would
help support its operations in far seas. For example, in


August 2017, China began to operate a support base
for logistics support of the PLA in Djibouti, a strategic
point in Eastern Africa facing the Gulf of Aden. It is
reported that a Fuchi-class replenishment ship entered
the “support base” port in March 2022, and a Yuzhaoclass dock landing ship entered the port in August 2022.
Furthermore, it has also been pointed out that in addition
to these, China may be considering or planning military
logistics facilities in several other countries, including
Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia,
Pakistan, Sri Lanka, the UAE, Kenya, Equatorial Guinea,
Seychelles, Tanzania, Angola, and Tajikistan.[34] In recent
years, China has been promoting its **“Belt and Road”**
Initiative (BRI) whose main purpose is advertised as
establishing an economic zone in regions including the
Eurasian continent, with the Chinese military possibly
taking on the role of the shield behind the initiative by
such means as the stabilization of areas via counterpiracy activities and the improvement of counterterrorism capabilities in coastal states through bilateral
and multilateral exercises. While it is thought that the
initiative includes a strategic intention to expand its
influence in the region, it is possible that the initiative
will further improve the PLA’s operational capabilities
in the Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean and elsewhere. For
example, China’s support for the construction of port
infrastructure in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and
other Indian Ocean countries as well as Pacific island
countries including Vanuatu could lead China to secure
outposts available for its military purposes.

**KEY WORDS**

**“Belt and Road” Initiative**

A concept for an economic sphere proposed by President Xi Jinping. The
“Silk Road Economic Belt” (“One Belt”) and the “21st Century Maritime
Silk Road” (“One Road”) were announced in September and October 2013,
respectively. Since then, the two concepts are collectively referred to as the
“Belt and Road” Initiative.


32 In 2012, Xue Long became the first polar research vessel to sail across the Arctic Ocean. In 2013, the cargo freighter Yong Sheng became the first Chinese commercial ship to cross the Arctic Ocean.
Canadian scientists took part in Xue Long’s voyage to the Arctic Ocean in 2017, and they succeeded for the first time in trial navigation of the Arctic Northwest Passage (along the north coast of Canada).
Furthermore, its second polar research vessel Xue Long 2 completed its first Arctic Sea cruising in September 2020, and China is promoting research and construction of a heavy icebreaker.

geographical conditions and globalizing economy, and
other factors indicate that the recent water and airspace
activities of the Navy, Air Force and other Chinese
organizations have the following objectives:
The first is to intercept operations by adversaries in
waters and airspace as far as possible from China in
order to defend its territorial land, waters and airspace.
Behind this objective is an increase in the effectiveness
of long-range attacks due to recent progress in science
and technology.
The second is to develop capabilities to deter and
prevent Taiwan’s independence. China maintains that
it will not allow any foreign intervention in solving the
Taiwan issue and realizing the unification of China.
To ensure the prevention of foreign intervention in the
Taiwan issue, China needs to enhance its operational
capabilities at sea and airspace as Taiwan is surrounded
by the sea in all directions.
The third is to weaken the control of other countries on
islands subject to China’s territorial claims and enhance
the claims through various surveillance activities and
use of force in waters and airspace surrounding these
islands. Such activities are considered to also have the
purpose of creating a fait accompli as part of the reasons
for unilaterally changing the status quo and justifying
China’s claims based on its own concept of “legal warfare.”
The fourth is to acquire, maintain, and protect its
maritime rights and interests. China is engaged in oil and
gas drilling as well as building facilities and surveying in
the East and South China Seas. It has been confirmed that
in addition to the existing four platforms, China has built
12 additional offshore platforms on the Chinese side of
the Japan-China median line of the East China Sea since
June 2013, and was also confirmed to be moving towards
installing a new structure in May 2022 and June 2022
respectively as well. In late June 2016, the installment
of an anti-surface vessel radar and a surveillance camera
was confirmed on one of the platforms. Attention is to
be paid to matters regarding the platforms, including the
purpose of such equipment. Japan has repeatedly lodged
protests against China’s unilateral development and
demanded the termination of such work.
The fifth is to defend its sea lanes of communications.
In the background is the fact that its sea lanes, including
its oil transportation routes from the Middle East, are
essential for the Chinese economy. Given the recent
strengthening of the Chinese Navy and Air Force, it
is believed that they have been expanding military


capabilities to cover distant waters beyond China s
near seas.
Given these objectives of China’s water and airspace
activities and recent trends, it is believed that China plans
to further expand the sphere of its activities, and further
intensify its operations in waters surrounding Japan,
including the East China Sea and the Pacific Ocean, as
well as in the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean.

**7 International Military Activities**


**Part**
**Ⅰ**

**Chapter**


In recent years, the PLA has been indicating its
positive attitude on nontraditional security missions such
as peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance and disaster
relief, and counterpiracy, dispatching numerous units for
such overseas missions.
China has vowed to consistently support and actively
participate in UN PKO, increasing its presence in UN PKO.
According to the UN, as of the end of November
2022, China had a total of 2,224 personnel including
troops and police members - the largest number of
peacekeepers among the permanent members of the
UN Security Council - engaged in UN peacekeeping
activities, including the United Nations Multidimensional
Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA).
The Chinese share has remained the second largest, after
the U.S. share, since 2016.
Moreover, China has been actively participating in
counter-piracy activities off the coast of Somalia and in
the Gulf of Aden as well as humanitarian assistance and
disaster relief activities.
It is pointed out that factors behind such Chinese
attitude include the growing need for protecting and
promoting China’s national interests overseas following
the expansion of national interests beyond its national
borders, China’s attempt to verify military capabilities
including units’ long-distance deployment, its intent
to raise its status by demonstrating its will to fulfill its
responsibilities to the international community, its hope
to diffuse the military’s peaceful and humanitarian
images, and its attempt to enhance relations with PKO
regions including African countries.

**8 Education and Training**


In recent years, the PLA under the policy of building
a military that “can fight and win a war” has promoted
practical exercises including large scale ones such as


-----

joint exercises led by theater commands, force-on-force
exercises, landing exercises, inter-theater exercises, and
large exercises including distant ones, as well as nighttime exercises and joint exercises with other countries,
in order to strengthen its operational capabilities.
In the education spectrum as well, the PLA aims
to train soldiers who have the ability to execute joint
operations. It was reported in 2017 that the PLA National
Defense University began training to develop human
resources capable of directing joint operations.
China has been developing defense mobilization
systems and others in order to effectively utilize private
resources in case of emergencies, including wars. The
military use of civilian resources includes civilian ships’
transportation of military equipment. As such initiative
generally augments China’s forces available for military
missions and is expected to proactively be promoted in
the future, the initiative’s implications for the Chinese
military forces’ operational capabilities should be
watched closely.

equipment, to modernize its military. It has been pointed
out that China is acquiring technologies ambitiously
not only through domestic technology research and
development and foreign direct investment, but also via
illegal means in the form of secret information theft.[36]
The trend of the national defense industry sector is
directly linked to the modernization of the military and
should be closely watched with strong attention.
China’s civil-military fusion policy has been evident
in the technology area. China promotes two-way
technological exchanges where military technologies
are utilized for developing the national economy while
civilian technologies are absorbed for national defense
development. It also seems interested in absorbing
foreign technologies available both for military and
civilian purposes. It is pointed out that China’s civilmilitary fusion policy gives priority to initiatives in seas,
outer space, cyber, AI, and other emerging areas for
China. The U.S. DoD has pointed out that civil-military
fusion includes six mutually related efforts: (1) fusion
of China’s defense industrial base with its civilian
technology and industrial base, (2) integration and use
of scientific and technological innovation across military
and civilian sectors, (3) human resources development
and mixing of military and civilian expertise and
knowledge, (4) incorporation of military requirements
into civilian infrastructure and use of civilian structures
for military purposes, (5) use of civilian services and
logistics capabilities for military purposes, and (6)
expansion and deepening of China’s defense mobilization
system in a manner that includes all relevant aspects of
society and economy for use in competition and war.[37, 38]

In addition, in recent years, China has reportedly
promoted the standardization of civilian products for
their military adoption from the production stage under
the civil-military fusion policy. This initiative is expected
to allow the military to more effectively utilize civilian
resources.
As the growth rate of defense spending has slowed in
recent years, the civil-military fusion policy is expected
to become increasingly important for China, which
must balance building up its defense and its economy.
In addition, in order to realize the aforementioned

Under the State Administration of Science, Technology
and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND) of the
Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, a
department of the State Council, China’s main national
defense industry had consisted of 12 corporations to
develop and produce nuclear weapons, missiles and
rockets, aircraft, vessels, information systems and other
military equipment. It is pointed out that China was the
fifth largest weapon supplier in the world as of 2021.[35]
In 2018, China National Nuclear Corporation and China
Nuclear Engineering & Construction Corporation was
reorganized. After China State Shipbuilding Corporation
merged with China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation
in 2019, the industry now comprises 10 corporations
including China State Shipbuilding Corporation.
While China imports highly sophisticated military
equipment and parts that it cannot produce domestically
from other countries such as Russia, it is believed that
China places emphasis on the enhancement of its military
industrial sector, including the domestic production of

because China s civil-military fusion policy is seen
as an indispensable means to achieve this, this policy,
including its relationship to “intelligentized warfare,”
must continue to be monitored with serious concern.

are thought to include alleviating other countries’
concerns regarding China by strengthening its relations
with these countries, creating a favorable security
environment for China, enhancing China’s influence in
the international community, exploring overseas arms
markets, securing stable supplies of natural resources,
and ensuring foreign bases.

**2 Relations with Russia**


**1 General Situation**

China, particularly regarding maritime issues over which
its interests conflict with others’, continues to demonstrate
its attitude of realizing its unilateral assertions without
compromise, while promoting assertive actions including
those to unilaterally change the status quo by force and
create a fait accompli for such changes, based on its own
assertions incompatible with the existing international
order. China has been promoting its BRI as a national
strategy, but some BRI-participating countries have
recently reconsidering BRI projects due mainly to their
fiscal deterioration. Furthermore, it has been pointed
that there have been moves towards creating China’s
own international order, including the establishment of
China-led multilateral mechanisms in many fields such
as security, growth, and development[39] to influence
political decisions in other countries through efforts such
as winning over foreign politicians.[40]

At the same time, China recognizes that a peaceful
and stable international environment is necessary for
maintaining sustainable economic development and
enhancing China’s overall national power. Based on such
recognition, China has advocated building a “community
of shared future for mankind” and referred to promoting
the building of “a new type of international relations
based on mutual respect, equity and justice, and winwin cooperation.” China proactively carries out military
exchanges with other countries. In recent years, China
has been engaged in active military exchanges not only
with major powers such as the United States and Russia
and with its neighboring countries including Southeast
Asian countries, but also with countries in Africa and
Latin America. Furthermore, movement to strengthen
relationships with Pacific countries is observed. The
objectives of China’s promotion of military exchanges


Ever since the so-called China-Soviet confrontation
ended in 1989, China and Russia have placed importance
on their bilateral relationship. They have emphasized
the deepening of their “strategic partnership” since its
establishment in the mid-1990s. In 2001, the ChinaRussia Treaty of Good- Neighborliness and Friendly
Cooperation was concluded. In 2004, the long-standing
issue of border demarcation between the two countries
came to a settlement. The two countries have a common
view on promoting the multipolarization of the world
and the establishment of a new international order, and
have further deepened their relations. At the ChinaRussia summit meeting in early February 2022, the two
countries assessed China-Russia relations as “superior
to political and military alliances of the Cold War era.”
Furthermore, for example, amid growing tensions
in U.S.-China and U.S.-Russia relations, China and
Russia have consistently deepened their cooperation.
Each country is believed to be planning to create an
international environment favorable to itself by taking
a united stance on security issues, such as Taiwan and
issues surrounding NATO’s eastern expansion, which
are in conflict with the United States and others.
On the military front, since the 1990s, China has
purchased modern weapons from Russia, including
fighters, destroyers, and submarines. Russia is currently


39 For example, President Xi put forward the “Global Security Initiative” consisting of advocacy of the United Nation’s authority and status as well as opposition to security build up sacrificing the security
of other countries in April 2022.

the largest supplier of weapons to China. Although
China-Russia arms transactions in value in recent years
have been lower than in some past period, China has
apparently continued to indicate its strong interests
in importing advanced Russian defense equipment
and in joint equipment development with Russia. For
example, China has introduced what are believed to be
the latest fourth generation Su-35 fighters and the S-400
surface-to-air missile system from Russia. China has
been reported as the first country to import the Russian
S-400 missile system. It is also suggested that Russia
has concerns about competing with China in arms
exports taking into consideration China’s improvement
of technological power.
Military exchanges between China and Russia take
place in such forms as routine mutual visits by senior
military officers and bilateral and multilateral exercises.
For example, China participated in the Vostok 2018
exercise in 2018, viewed as one of the largest Russian
military exercises since the end of the Cold War, the
Tsentr 2019 exercise in 2019, Maneuvers “Kavkaz
2020” in 2020, Zapad/Interaction 2021 in 2021, and
Vostok 2022 in 2022. It is believed that in total over
2,000 troops from PLAA, PLAN, and PLAAF as well
as aircraft and naval vessels participated in the Vostok
2022 exercise. Additionally, the two countries have
held the large-scale bilateral naval exercise “Joint Sea”
since 2012. The annual exercise for 2016 took place in
the South China Sea for the first time, and that for 2017
was held in the Baltic Sea and Sea of Okhotsk for the
first time. In October 2021, a group of vessels, including
a Renhai-class destroyer, participated in the exercise,
which was conducted in the Sea of Japan. Furthermore,
China and Russia continued this by conducting their first
joint navigation around Japan by a total of 10 vessels
from both countries. “Joint Sea” exercises in December
2022 were conducted in the East China Sea for the first
time in eight years since 2014. In 2016 and 2017, the two
countries held the “Aerospace Security” missile defense
computer-simulated exercise. Furthermore, China has
held the counterterrorism joint exercise “Peace Mission”
between China and Russia or among the member
countries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization
(SCO), which was established in June 2001 and includes
Russia. China likely regards these exchanges as an

41 According to SIPRI Arms Transfers Database


opportunity to learn about how to operate Russian-made
weapons and the operational doctrine of the Russian
Armed Forces, which have combat experiences.
In addition, moves indicating deepened China-Russia
relations have been confirmed in recent years. In the two
countries’ “first joint strategic flight” of bombers in July
2019, their bombers joined in the Sea of Japan and flew to
the East China Sea. In September 2019, China and Russia
signed a series of documents on cooperation in the military
and military technologies.[42] Similar trends continued in
2020. In December that year, Russian Defense Minister
Sergey Shoigu and then Chinese Defense Minister
Wei Fenghe held a video teleconference and signed
a protocol on the extension of the intergovernmental
agreement on mutual notifications of ballistic missile
and carrier rocket launches for 10 years.
Furthermore, bombers of Russia and China have
flown long distance jointly around Japan a total of
five times since the first time mentioned above in July
2019, namely, in December 2020, November 2021,
May 2022, and November 2022. The joint flight in May
2022 was with stronger provocation than ever because it
was intended for demonstration of force against Japan,
which was holding a Japan-U.S.-Australia-India summit
meeting at that time. Furthermore, diversified action was
seen. Russia announced for the joint flight in November
2022 that Russian aircraft landed on airfields in China
for the first time after the joint flight and vice versa.
Warships of Russia and China jointly navigated in
October 2021, as mentioned above, and warships of
both countries navigated separately one week apart
around Japan in almost an orbital manner. Warships of
both countries participated in the Vostok 2022 exercise
mentioned above, conducted machine gun shooting on
the sea area west of Hokkaido, and jointly navigated
around Japan.
These repeated joint actions conducted by Russia
and China are clearly intended for demonstration of
force against Japan and are of grave concern from the
perspective of the security of Japan.
In this way, China and Russia demonstrate actions
to enhance cooperation further even while aggression
against Ukraine is ongoing. There is a possibility for the
two countries to enhance military cooperation further,
and these developments, including the strengthening

**3 Relations with North Korea**


**4 Relations with Other Countries**

**(1) Relations with Southeast Asian Countries**
As for its relations with countries in Southeast Asia,
reciprocal summit-level visits and other activities
continue to be actively carried out. China is also actively
involved in multilateral frameworks such as ASEAN
Plus One (China), ASEAN Plus Three (Japan, China
and the ROK), East Asia Summit (EAS) and ASEAN
Regional Forum (ARF). At the ASEAN-China Special
Summit in November 2021, there was an announcement
on the elevation to the ASEAN-China Comprehensive
Strategic Partnership. Furthermore, China has developed
bilateral relations through infrastructure development
support, etc., under the BRI.
On the military front, there seems to be moves that
China has made efforts toward military confidence
building, such as the first ASEAN-China Maritime Field
Training Exercise, which took place in October 2018.
Moreover, it was reported about the possibility of China
using part of Cambodia’s Ream Naval Base exclusively
in July 2019 and June 2022. Concerning this matter,
the Cambodian side denied the existence of such a fact,
saying that hosting foreign military bases is against its
Constitution. In addition, in June 2021, Cambodia’s
Minister of National Defense acknowledged that China
had contributed to the development of the Ream Naval
Base, which the United States is considered to have
concerns about in regard to its military use by China.
However, he stated that access to the base facilities was
not limited to China alone.
In July 2016, an arbitration award based on the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)
adjudicating the Philippines’ case against China in the
South China Sea was rendered, accepting most of the
Philippine claims. After that, the Philippines was said to
have refrained from referring to the arbitration award.
In September 2019, however, a Philippine Presidential
Office spokesperson noted that the arbitration award was
still a subject in bilateral talks, and in September 2020,
then President Duterte remarked at the United Nations
General Assembly that, “The (Arbitral) Award is now
part of international law beyond compromise and beyond
the reach of passing governments to dilute, diminish, or
abandon.” In November 2022, the Philippines announced
that China Coast Guard interrupted a Philippine navy

China has kept close relations with North Korea under the
1961 Sino-North Korean Mutual Aid and Cooperation
Friendship Treaty. In June 2019, President Xi Jinping
became the first Chinese president to visit North Korea
in 14 years, and held his fifth summit meeting with the
Chairman of the State Affairs Commission Kim Jongun. Chairman Kim sent a congratulatory telegram to
President Xi Jinping on his election as President for his
third term saying “we will shape a more beautiful future
of the North Korea-China relationship meeting demand
of the times” in October 2022. President Xi stated in his
reply that he would put a great emphasis on the ChinaNorth Korea relationship and make it great in the new
state of affairs while the world is changing.
China has reportedly adopted three principles on the
Korea Peninsula - (1) the denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula, (2) the maintenance of peace and stability on
the Korean Peninsula, and (3) the resolution of problems
through dialogue and consultations - indicating that
China gives priority to the maintenance of stability
and dialogue as well as the denuclearization. Under
these principles, China, while agreeing to UN Security
Council resolutions until 2017 to enhance sanctions on
North Korea, cooperated with Russia in proposing a
draft resolution including lifting some of the sanctions
based on UNSC resolutions recently. In May 2022,
China exercised its power of veto with Russia to a draft
resolution for sanctions proposed by the United States
in response to North Korea’s launching of ICBM-class
ballistic missiles.
Although China has vowed to have seriously observed
its international obligations, it has been pointed out
that Chinese ships have been involved in illicit shipto-ship transfer prohibited by the UN Security Council
resolutions.

**(2) Relations with Central Asian Countries**
The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, located in
the western part of China, is situated next to Central
Asia. Therefore, China is deeply concerned about
the political stability and security situations, such as
terrorism by Islamic extremists, in Central Asian states.
Such concerns of China appear to be reflected in China’s
tightened border control and its engagement in the
SCO and the stabilization of Afghanistan. Moreover,
China is strongly interested in Central Asia, with a
view to diversifying its supply sources and procurement
methods for resources. China promotes cooperation in
the energy field with Central Asian countries, such as
the construction of oil and natural gas pipelines between
China and Central Asian nations.

**(3) Relations with South Asian Countries**
China has a close relationship with Pakistan under their
“all-weather strategic partnership,” and mutual visits
by their summit leaders take place frequently. Their
cooperation in the military sector, including bilateral
exercises, exporting weapons, and transferring military
technology, is also deepening. As the importance of
sea lanes increases for China, it is believed that the
importance of Pakistan is rising for China accordingly,
partly because of the geopolitical features of Pakistan
which faces the Indian Ocean.
Although economic ties between China and India are
strengthening, the two countries have not demarcated their
borders in areas such as Kashmir and Arunachal Pradesh.
In May 2020, a clash between Chinese and Indian
forces occurred near the China-India border in Ladakh,
India, and tensions between the two countries escalated
with the first deadly clash in 45 years on June 15
of the same year. Since then, China and India have
regularly held commander-level meetings based on the
management agreement for the Line of Actual Control,
a temporary border between the two countries. They
agreed to separate their forces at Pangong Lake in
February 2021 and in the Gogra area in July of the same
year. The countries are currently still continuing efforts
to gradually ease tensions.
In recent years, China has also been deepening its
relations with Sri Lanka. To Sri Lanka, which is located
at a strategic point in the Indian Ocean and supports the
BRI, China has provided massive economic and technical
cooperation in infrastructure development, including for
railroads ports and airports On the other hand in July


force. China admitted the subject was the debris of
Chinese rocket, and insisted it was handed over to China
peacefully after discussion on the site.
In July 2017 and March 2018, the Vietnamese
government reportedly made foreign companies,
engaged in oil drilling in the South China Sea with the
permission of the Vietnamese government, cancel the
drilling under the pressure from China. Chinese and
Vietnamese government ships staged a standoff over
oil and natural gas drilling within Vietnam’s exclusive
economic zone from July 2019 until Vietnam withdrew
its HAKURYU-5 drilling rig in October of that year
to end the standoff. The Government of Vietnam also
announced in April 2020 that it had protested the Chinese
side concerning the incident in which a China Coast
Guard vessel rammed and sunk a Vietnamese fishing boat
near the Paracel Islands. On the other hand, in December
2021, the joint medical exercise “Peace Rescue 2021”
was conducted for the first time by the Chinese and
Vietnamese militaries to improve the medical support
capabilities of both militaries. During the exercise, the
Chinese side provided the Vietnamese side with medical
masks, protective clothing, and PCR test equipment.
Indonesia has had frequent disputes with China over
Chinese fishing boats’ operations within Indonesia’s
exclusive economic zone and taken strong actions
against foreign fishing boats engaging in alleged illegal
operations. Recently, the Indonesian government filed
a strong protest against Chinese fishing boats’ illegal
operations near Indonesia’s Natuna Islands from
December 2019 to January 2020, rejecting China’s
assertion on the nine-dash line anew.
China and ASEAN have continued talks to discuss the
formulation of the Code of Conduct of Parties in the South
China Sea (COC). In July 2019, China announced at the
Chinese and ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ meeting that they
had completed the first reading of the Single Draft COC
Negotiating Text. Subsequently, a second reading was
initiated. At the August 2021 ASEAN Foreign Ministers’
Meeting, it was noted that a provisional agreement on
the Preamble had been reached. Despite the effects of
COVID-19 and other factors, in the Joint Statement
of the ASEAN-China Special Summit in November
of that year, there was mention of expectations for the
early conclusion of an effective and substantive COC in
accordance with international law, including UNCLOS.

**(5) Relations with Middle East and African Countries,**
**Pacific Island countries, and Central and South**
**American Countries**

China has been enhancing its relations with Middle
Eastern and African nations in the economic realm. In
recent years, it has also strengthened military relations
with them. Not only intensive interactions among state
leaders and senior military officials but also arms exports
and exchanges between military forces are actively
conducted. China also actively dispatches personnel
to undertake UN PKO in Africa. Some suspect that
underlying these movements could be China’s aim to
ensure a stable supply of natural resources and to secure
overseas bases in the future.
China is Australia’s biggest trade partner. However,
there has been economic friction between the two
countries such as China’s successive restriction on
importing Australian beef and other goods since Australia
suggested the necessity for an independent investigation
into the origin of COVID-19. China has also been
boosting its relations with Pacific island countries by
providing them with proactive and continuous economic
support and medical services deploying a military
hospital ship. China has promoted resources development
in Papua New Guinea and signed an agreement with
the island country on military cooperation. Moreover,
it was announced in April 2022 that China and the
Solomon Islands signed the “Framework of Security
Cooperation.” It was reported in March 2022 that the
draft framework included items that allow China to
deploy police and troops and allow Chinese warships
to call at ports and get supplies. China has also been
moving to enhance military relations with Vanuatu,
Fiji, and Tonga. In addition, when a volcanic eruption
occurred in Tonga in January 2022, China dispatched
transport aircraft and supply ships. While China has been
enhancing relations with Pacific island nations, Australia
and some other countries have expressed concerns about
such Chinese moves.
China has been striving to further deepen its relations
with Central and South American countries, holding
ministerial meetings with the Community of Latin
American and Caribbean States (CELAC) since 2015. In
the military field, China has dispatched senior officials
and sold arms to these countries and enhanced relations
with them in medical services, counterterrorism and


2017, an agreement was reached to lend interests for 99
years to Chinese enterprises at the Port of Hambantota,
which is being constructed with Chinese loans. Some
have noted that this constitutes what has been described
as a “debt trap.” President Wickremesinghe took office
in July 2022, and continues discussions with creditor
countries including China to resolve the debt problem.
Chinese tracking ship Yuan Wang 5 reportedly operated
by the PLA Strategic Support Force entered the Port of
Hambantota in August 2022.
Additionally, China is deepening its relations with
Bangladesh through its port development in Chittagong
where a naval base is located, arms exports including
Ming-class submarines, and other deals.

**(4) Relations with European Countries**
For China, the European Union (EU) countries are
increasingly in its presence especially in the economic field.
European countries possess more advanced military
technologies than China or Russia regarding information
and communication technology, avionics/aeroengines, air
independence propulsion (AIP) systems for submarines,
and other areas. The EU countries have maintained their
arms embargo on China since the Tiananmen Square
incident in 1989, and China has requested them to lift the
embargo.[43] If the EU arms embargo on China were lifted,
sophisticated military technologies could be transferred
to China and to third countries via China, dramatically
changing the security environment in the Indo-Pacific
and other regions.
China’s recent rise has attracted attention from NATO
as well. The new strategic concept announced at a
NATO summit meeting in June 2022 states that “China’s
ambition and coercive policies challenge NATO’s
interests, security, and values,” and expressed concern
over rapid enhancement of nuclear forces, absence of
transparency, and malicious hybrid and cyber activities.
Based on this, it mentioned that NATO will be engaged
with China for the alliance’s security interests, and to
prevent China’s coercive actions to divide the NATO.
China’s relations with European countries, including
EU discussions on the arms embargo on China and
NATO’s policy on engagement with China, should be
continuously watched.

and other Latin American countries, Saudi Arabia, and
other Middle Eastern countries, and Turkmenistan and
other former Soviet Union countries.[44]

Some claim that China has transferred weapons to
foreign countries in order to strengthen its strategic
relationships with friendly nations, enhance its influence
in the international community, and secure natural
resources. China has not participated in some of the
frameworks for international arms export control, and
some point out that missile-related and other technologies
have been transferred from China to other countries.


China has been expanding exports of weapons such
as missiles, tanks, aircraft including drones, and
ships. China’s major arms export destinations include
Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Myanmar. China has also
been reportedly exporting arms to Algeria, Tanzania,
Nigeria, and other African countries, countries in South
East Asia including Thailand and Indonesia, Venezuela

such as climate change and food security at the U.S.China summit meeting held for the first time in person
under the Biden administration in November 2022.
However, they made no concessions in areas of conflict
such as the Taiwan issue, human rights issues, and on
trade issues. United States Armed Forces shot down
a Chinese reconnaissance balloon that was detected
over the U.S. homeland in February 2023. The U.S.
Government communicated to China that the flight was
a clear violation of its sovereignty and of international
law, and postponed Secretary of State Blinken’s visit to
China scheduled in the same month. China insisted that
it was a privately owned weather observation airship
that strayed into U.S. territory due to force majeure, and
expressed strong discontent with the shooting down of
the balloon by the United States, and protested against it.
In this way, strategic competition between the United
States and China in various fields is becoming more and
more apparent and has enhanced a sense of caution in the
United States especially regarding the field of sensitive
technologies and key technologies in which the fierce
competition is most perceptible. China promotes the
“intelligentization” of the PLA; for example, General
Secretary Xi of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP),
stated in his report in the 20th CCP Congress in October
2022 that China “will continue integrated development of
the military through mechanization, informatization, and
the application of smart technologies (intelligentization).”
Based on these movements, the Biden administration
puts effort into protecting and fostering sensitive
technologies and key technologies recognizing that U.S.
security will be threatened as a result of the strengthening
of Chinese military power due to leakage of sensitive
and key technologies from the United States and its
allies. Aimed at strengthening the competitiveness of the
United States in the semiconductor field, the “Creating
Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS)
and Science Act” was passed in August 2022 to support
semiconductor manufacturing companies in the United
States financially, while making it compulsory that
the supported companies agree with the Secretary of
Commerce not to enhance advanced semiconductor
manufacturing facilities in countries of particular
concern including China for ten years. In addition, the
administration announced the enhancement of Export
Administration Regulations related to semiconductors in


October 2022 to limit the ability of China to obtain and
manufacture technologies and products used in advanced
military systems to increase the accuracy and speed of
military decision making. It also took measures to add
Chinese AI semiconductor-related companies to the
entity list in December 2022 to restrict exportation from
the United States because the companies are supporting
the modernization of the PLA. In February 2023, Chinese
companies and institutes related to the aerospace industry
were added to the entity list for supporting the PLA’s
aerospace plans including plans for balloons.
On the other hand, China criticizes these measures
taken by the United States as malicious blockage of
Chinese companies. Moreover, in response to the
tightening of regulations by the United States and other
foreign countries, China has been enforcing a series of
countermeasures, such as laws and regulations, since 2020.
In September 2020, China implemented its Unreliable
Entity List in response to the U.S. Entity List. In December
of the same year, China’s Export Control Law entered
into force to control the export of technology and the
like related to China’s national security and interests. As
further pushing back against the United States measures,
in January 2021, China passed new rules to protect its
firms from “unjustified extra-territorial application of
foreign legislation and other measures.” In addition to this,
in June 2022, China announced the entry into force of the
Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law and implemented sanctions
against U.S. individuals and organizations, including the
former U.S. Secretary of Commerce. China’s Ministry of
Commerce then criticized the U.S. Export Administration
Regulations related to semiconductors as disruptive to
the order of the international economy and trading, and
presented a case to the World Trade Organization (WTO)
in December 2022. In February 2023, China for the first
time added two U.S. companies to the entity list of alleged
unreliable business connections because, in Chinese
opinion, the companies compromise the safety of China
by frequently selling weapons to Taiwan.
Competition in the technology field between the
United States and China is likely to intensify further
in the future as both sides continue to reciprocate each
other’s efforts to set forth new regulations. For example,
the United States made a move to enhance bilateral and
multilateral cooperation, the effects of which can be seen
to be spreading internationally.

**Military Trends of the United States and China in the Indo-Pacific Region**
**2**


2022 places importance on strategic competition with
China and Russia. Newly added to the NDAA are
initiatives relating to strengthening the posture and
capacity of the U.S. military in the Indo-Pacific region,
such as the “Taiwan Enhanced Resilience Act” with
various provisions to strengthen security cooperation
with Taiwan, and to establish an inter-departmental task
force to confront economic threat from China, as well
as for the assignment of a headquarters in command of
joint operations within the area of responsibility of U.S.
Indo-Pacific Command.
The United States expressed its determination to
optimize its force posture in the Indo-Pacific, including
Japan in the joint statement of the Japan-U.S. Security
Consultative Committee (Japan-U.S. “2+2”) held in
January 2023. Furthermore, the United States repeatedly
states that Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty
is applied to the Senkaku Islands as well. The Biden
administration also reconfirms in the NSS its unwavering
commitment to defense of Japan, including the Senkaku
Islands, under the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, and this
policy is continuously reconfirmed in various situations
including Japan-U.S. summit meetings.
On the other hand, China resists this U.S. posture,
saying these are acts of repressing the growth of China and
protecting U.S. hegemony. It is seen that China is wary
of the growth of initiatives such as the Quad into strong
alliances, as well as with the growing involvement of the
United States in the Indo-Pacific region. Furthermore,
the military power balance between the United States
and China in the Indo-Pacific region is changing because
China is rapidly strengthening its military power against
a background of economic growth and other factors.
China is out of the framework of the IntermediateRange Nuclear Force Treaty (INF Treaty) and the New
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START Treaty)
and has been enhancing ground-launched missile power
unilaterally. Although the United States has insisted that
China should be included in arms control negotiations
and expressed its intention to apply brakes to China’s
missile power build up, China consistently refuses,[1]
asserting that the United States should take the initiative
in conducting disarmament.


**1 General Situation**

The Biden administration released its “Indo-Pacific
Strategy” in February 2022 clearly stating that it places
the highest priority on the Indo-Pacific region because
the region is facing mounting challenges from China.
The administration pointed out in the NSS published
later that competition with China was most pronounced
in the Indo-Pacific region. The NDS also pointed out
that China attempts to coerce its neighbors and threaten
their interests using its growing capabilities, including
its economic influence, the PLA’s growing strength and
military footprint in order to undermine U.S. alliances
and security partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region, and
stated that the challenges from China in the Indo-Pacific
region have the priority.
The Biden administration that puts the Indo-Pacific
region utmost importance announced in NSS that it was
going to deepen its tightest partnerships with five allies,
namely Japan, Australia, the Republic of Korea (ROK),
the Philippines, and Thailand based on the recognition
that a Free and Open Indo-Pacific is achievable only
with the collective capacity of alliances and partnerships.
Furthermore, it was stated that the Quad (comprising
Japan, Australia, India, and the United States) and
AUKUS (Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United
States) are also important for dealing with regional
challenges, because total power can be strengthened
through cooperation between Indo-Pacific countries and
European countries. The administration also stated that
it places emphasis on Southeast Asia and Pacific Islands
regions to enhance regional diplomacy, development,
and economic involvement. Moreover, it discloses in the
NDS the direction of the United States to reinforce and
build out resilient security architecture in the Indo-Pacific
region in order to sustain a free and open regional order,
and deter attempts to resolve disputes by force. With this
view, it is stated that it is necessary to modernize the
alliance with Japan and strengthen combined capabilities
by aligning strategic planning and priorities in a more
integrated manner.
The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for
Fiscal Year 2023 passed through Congress in December

The changes in the military power balance between

announced an anomalous approach to a U.S. Forces
aircraft by a Chinese fighter jet over the South China Sea
in December 2022.
Moreover, China utilizes not only its military forces
but also the Coast Guard, which is a “maritime law
enforcement organization” in the Coast Guard law,
and so-called maritime militia to increase pressure on
the neighboring countries, attempting to change the
status quo. Actions by China asserting sovereignty have
been seen in attempts to interfere with the activities
of other countries. There have been cases in which
fishing activities of neighboring countries have been
interrupted by actions such as the firing of warning shots
at fishing boats from China Coast Guard machine guns.
In addition, President Marcos summoned the Chinese
ambassador in the Philippines and stated his serious
concerns to the incident in which a China Coast Guard
ship shone a military-grade laser at a Philippine Coast
Guard ship supplying the Philippine Navy near the
Second Thomas Shoal in February 2023. The China
Coast Guard Law that entered into force in February
2021 includes problematic provisions in terms of
their inconsistency with international law. Sources of
inconsistency include, among others, ambiguity as to
geographical areas the Coast Guard Law applies and how
the rules governing the use weapons are implemented,
and neighboring countries started expressing concerns
about Chinese moves. In addition, in March 2021, the
Philippine government announced that it had confirmed
approximately 220 Chinese militia ships near Whitsun
Reef and expressed concern over the action of maritime
militia. It is pointed out that maritime militia play
major roles in forceful activities, but not to the extent
of provoking armed conflict, in order to fulfill China’s
political objectives.[2] It is necessary to pay attention to
these asymmetric strategies.

See Section 2-2-6 (5) (Trends of Activities in the South China Sea);

Section 7 (Southeast Asia)

The United States has been criticizing China’s action
about issues concerning the South China Sea hitherto,
and conducted Freedom of Navigation Operations and
other activities.
The Biden administration has continued to show its
consistent and strict deterrence stance against China.
For example, it stated that the United States will reject
China’s claims about maritime interests in the South

**Chapter**


With regard to the issues over the South China Sea,
the United States is concerned about such dimensions
as obstruction to the freedom of navigation in sea
lanes, restrictions on the activities of U.S. Forces, and
the worsening security situation in the entire region.
The United States has requested China comply with
international norms, and has repeatedly criticized
China’s unilateral and assertive actions. On the other
hand, China expresses opposition saying the United
States is the largest threat to peace and stability in the
South China Sea, and confrontation between these two
countries is deepening.
China has been advancing into the South China Sea
taking advantage of the power vacuum there since the
1950s, and promoting the militarization of the Paracel
Islands. It has also been conducting rapid reclamation
of the Spratly Islands on a large scale since 2014. Even
after the illegality of the Chinese activities such as land
reclamation was determined at the Philippines-China
arbitration in 2016, China has made it clear that it would
not comply with the decision and has been promoting its
plan to militarize the area.
In addition, China enhances and activates its actions
in the sea and air space in the region, and has repeatedly
conducted military exercises and launched ballistic
missiles in the South China Sea. Also, in August
2022, China announced that aircraft carrier Shandong
conducted training in the South China Sea. Actions that
heighten the tension between China and its neighboring
nations have also been seen. For example, the Malaysian
Air Force announced that 16 aircraft of the PLA Air
Force (PLAAF) approached the coast of Malaysia in June
2021. Furthermore, China has repeatedly interrupted
armed forces of other countries operating in the South
China Sea. For example, Australia announced that a
Royal Australian Air Force patrol aircraft in flight over
the South China Sea received dangerous interference
from PLAAF jets in June 2022, and the United States

China Sea, and stand up together with Southeast Asian
countries facing China’s pressure. Antony Blinken,
U.S. Secretary of State, stated again in July 2021, on
the fifth anniversary of the ruling of the arbitral tribunal
to Philippines v. China, that the United States demands
China comply with the obligations of international law.
In addition, in January 2022, the U.S. Department of
State released a study examining China’s maritime
claims in the South China Sea in light of international
law. The study concluded that China’s claims over most
of the South China Sea are inconsistent with international
law and gravely undermine the rule of law in the ocean.
The administration shows its stance to further enhance
cooperation with countries surrounding the South China
Sea. For example, U.S. Vice President Harris reaffirmed
the commitment of the United States to the Mutual
Defense Treaty between the Philippines and the United
States in the case of armed attacks on the Armed Forces
of Philippines in the South China Sea, and announced
new support measures for Philippine maritime law
enforcement agencies in November 2022.
Additionally, the United States has sought to
enhance military efforts in the South China Sea. It has
continuously conducted the Freedom of Navigation
Operations, carried out joint exercises in July 2020 by
deploying two Carrier Strike Groups for the first time
since 2014, and even after President Biden took office,
in February 2021, conducted similar exercises several
times in order to confront China’s excessive claims on
maritime interests. The United States has also conducted
joint training with partner countries including Japan, the
United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, Canada,
Singapore, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Responding
to these American efforts, China has criticized the United
States for hindering the peace and stability of the region.
Going forward, while forming free and open order
based on the rule of law is important in the South
China Sea, the military tensions may rise. Japan, which
promotes the vision of a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific”
(FOIP) with the United States, will have to pay great
attention to the situation.

**3 Taiwan**


China and Taiwan. China is also strongly opposed to
any foreign intervention in the unification of China as
well as any move towards the independence of Taiwan
and has repeatedly stated that it has not renounced the
use of force in respect of the Taiwan issue. “The AntiSecession Law,” enacted in March 2005, clearly lays
out China’s policy of not renouncing the use of force,
providing that in the event that possibilities for a peaceful
reunification should be completely exhausted, the state
shall employ nonpeaceful means and other necessary
measures to protect China’s sovereignty and territorial
integrity. General Secretary Xi stated in the report to the
20th Party Congress held in October 2022, in respect of
cross-strait issues, China’s position to “continue to strive
for peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity
and the utmost effort” while he stated again “resolving
the Taiwan question and realizing China’s complete
reunification is a natural requirement for realizing the
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation” and “we will never
promise to renounce the use of force, and we reserve the
option of taking all measures necessary.”
On the other hand, the United States stated in the NSS
that it has an abiding interest in maintaining peace and
stability across the Taiwan Strait, opposes any unilateral
changes to the status quo from either side, does not
support Taiwan independence, and remains committed
to the “One China” policy which is guided by the Taiwan
Relations Act (TRA), Three Joint Communiqués, and
the Six Assurances. Based on this, the United States also
makes it clear that it intends to uphold its commitments
under the TRA to support Taiwan’s self-defense, and to
maintain the United States’ capacity to resist any resort
to force or coercion against Taiwan.
The Biden administration has positioned China as
America’s most consequential geopolitical challenge as
well as the only competitor with the intent and power to
reshape the international order, and has made clear its
diplomatic stance to contain China through cooperation
with allies and partner countries on issues concerning
Taiwan and other matters. For example, since the start
of Biden administration, the importance of “peace and
stability across the Taiwan Strait” has been repeatedly
mentioned at international meetings such as the JapanU.S. summit meetings, the G7 Summit, and the U.S.-EU
summit meetings. Furthermore, the Biden administration
has been promoting efforts to enhance Taiwan’s
international standing, including calling on UN member
states to support Taiwan’s meaningful participation in

underlying premise and foundation for dialogue between


-----

the UN system.
The United States has decided to sell weapons to
Taiwan based on the TRA. Since the inauguration
of the Biden administration also, the United States
has continued to sell weapons such as self-propelled
howitzers, aircraft-launched missiles, and maintenance
and repair packages for air defense missile systems.
The Biden administration also continued to have U.S.
warships pass through the Taiwan Strait periodically.
Moreover, President Tsai Ing-wen acknowledged that the
U.S. military was visiting Taiwan for training purposes
in an interview with U.S. media in October 2021.
With regard to the United States, not only the
government but also Congress has indicated its intention
to further enhance support for Taiwan. Congressional
delegations of the United States including then Speaker of
the U.S. House of Representatives Pelosi, visited Taiwan
repeatedly and met with President Tsai and others, and
exchanged views on strengthening U.S.-Taiwan relations
and other matters during 2022. Moreover, the FY2023
NDAA that passed through Congress in December 2022
includes approvals for the Taiwan Enhanced Resilience
Act to enhance security cooperation with Taiwan, and
military financing of up to US$10 billion over five years
from 2023 to 2027, among other items.
Responding to this, China has further intensified
military activities around Taiwan. According to
announcements from the Ministry of National Defense
of Taiwan, the number of Chinese military aircraft
entering airspace around Taiwan has been increasing
since September 2020. The total number of aircraft
entering the airspace was over 970 in 2021, and that
number increased significantly from the previous
year to over 1,700 aircraft in 2022. Furthermore, the
Ministry announced that other aircraft such as attack
helicopters, air refueling tankers, and UAVs came to be
confirmed entering the airspace from 2021, in addition to
conventional fighter jets and bombers.
China announced that it will conduct “a series of


integrated military actions and set six training areas
around Taiwan, in conjunction with then Speaker of the
U.S. House of Representatives Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan,
on August 2, 2022. China launched nine ballistic
missiles on August 4, 2022, five of which were landed
within the Japanese Executive Economic Zone (EEZ),
and another, the closest, was landed at a point of about
80 km from Yonagunijima Island. This was perceived
as a threat to local residents. It is probable that, in this
military exercise, China may have rehearsed some parts
of a Taiwan invasion operation, such as the blockade
of Taiwan, ground/ship attacks, the acquisition of sea/
air superiority in wartime, and gray-zone situations,
including cyber attacks and “cognitive warfare.”
Furthermore, according to the announcement of
National Defense Ministry of Taiwan, PLA aircraft
intermittently entered air space east of the ChinaTaiwan “median line”[3] over Taiwan Strait, since the U.S.
Congress Speaker Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan.

Column “Chinese Military Trends Concerning Taiwan”


Due to these increasing military activities by China
in the vicinity of Taiwan and the response from the
Taiwanese side to the situation, the possibility of military
tension between China and Taiwan to become further
heightened cannot be denied.
While the Biden administration is clarifying its
stance of supporting Taiwan in the military-related
area, it is deemed unlikely that China, which position
Taiwan issues as “the core of the core interests,” will
show a compromising attitude towards the U.S. stance.
It is viewed that the U.S.-China conflict over Taiwan
may become more apparent. Stabilizing the situation
surrounding Taiwan is important not only for Japan’s
security but also for the stability of the international
community. Therefore, it is necessary that we pay close
attention to the situation with a sense of crisis more than
ever before.

from meetings held by international organizations,
including ones in which they had participated up to that
point.[5] As Honduras severed diplomatic relations with
Taiwan and established such relations with China in
March 2023, the number of countries having diplomatic
relations with Taiwan declined to 13 from 22 in May
2016, when President Tsai took office. Taiwan is
strongly protesting these actions, claiming them to be
“actions taken by China that compress the international
space of Taiwan.”

Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen from the Democratic
Progressive Party, who took office in 2016, has noted
that she has never accepted the “1992 Consensus” that
China claims as embodying the “One-China” principle.[4]
In response, China has criticized the Democratic
Progressive Party for destroying the political foundation
of the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations by
rejecting the “1992 Consensus” unilaterally, emphasizing
that the maintenance of the “1992 Consensus” would
be the unshakable foundation for peace and stability of
cross-Strait relations.
In a January 2019 speech at an event commemorating
the 40th anniversary of China’s “Message to Compatriots
in Taiwan,” regarding the application of the “one country
two systems” model to Taiwan, General Secretary Xi
stated that “the specific form of the ‘one country, two
systems’ model in Taiwan will give full consideration
to the situation in Taiwan.” In her immediate response
to the speech, President Tsai issued a statement firmly
rejecting the “one country, two systems” model and
called for negotiations between “government-authorized
agencies.” Moreover, in October 2021, at the ceremony
commemorating the 110th anniversary of the Xinhai
Revolution, General Secretary Xi sought to check the
Tsai administration again, stating, “Those who… seek
to split the country will come to no good end; they will
be disdained by the people and condemned by history.”
On the other hand, in her speech for the Double Tenth
National Day Celebration that month, President Tsai
said, “We call for maintaining the status quo,” stating
that “the Republic of China and the People’s Republic
of China should not be subordinate to each other,” and
emphasized the stance that cross-strait conflicts should
be resolved through dialogue between the two sides on
equal footing.
In regard to relations between the international
community and Taiwan, since around the inauguration of
President Tsai for her first term, Taiwanese delegates were
refused attendance at or had their invitations deferred

With regard to Taiwan’s military power, at present,
ground forces, including the Navy Marine Corps, have
a total of approximately 104,000 personnel. In regard
to the organization of the army, plans are underway
to abolish the traditional Army Corps and the like
and establish “theaters of operation” as permanent
organizations of joint operation. The Taiwanese Minister
of National Defense explained the reason for this as being
advantageous for the execution of integrated operations
during conflict or peacetime. In addition, it is assessed
that approximately 1.66 million reserve personnel of the
air, naval, and ground forces would be available in case of
war. In January 2022, the All-out Defense Mobilization
Agency was established to integrate the reserve forces
and public and private organizations involved in wartime
mobilization to optimize the efficiency of the mobilization
system in the event of an emergency. Regarding naval
capabilities, in addition to Kidd-class destroyers which
were imported from the United States, Taiwan possesses
the indigenously built “Tuo Chiang” stealth corvette,
among other vessels. Taiwan is currently promoting a
national shipbuilding program to independently build
its own military vessels, which includes plans to build
eleven Tuo Chiang-class corvettes by 2026 and ultimately
about eight indigenously built submarines. Regarding
air capabilities, Taiwan possesses F-16 fighters (A/B
and F-16V upgraded from A/B), Mirage 2000 fighters,


The “1992 Consensus” refers to what represents a common understanding reached between Chinese and Taiwanese authorities in 1992 on the “One-China” principle. The CCP and Taiwan’s
Kuomintang Nationalist Party (Taiwan’s ruling party at the time), viewed as parties to the consensus, have reportedly differed over the interpretation of the consensus. In addition, Taiwan’s Democratic
Progressive Party has clarified that it has not accepted the “1992 Consensus.”


-----

Ching-kuo fighters, and other assets. In November 2021,
Taiwan’s first unit composed of F-16V fighters upgraded
from F-16A/B fighters was established at Chiayi Air
Base, and the deployment of fighters capable of carrying
longer-range missiles is being strengthened, including
the new F-16V fighters scheduled to be introduced from
the United States.
Taiwan adopted conscription in 1951, but it has been
switching to a volunteer system mainly to improve the
expertise of its military personnel, and the last of the
conscripts were enlisted by the end of 2018. After that,
while the four-month mandated military training for
males aged eighteen to thirty-six has been maintained,
the Tsai administration decided in December 2022 to
revive the one-year obligatory military service for males
of conscription age from 2024. The administration stated
that the new military service will include more enhanced
training than conventional mandated military training,
such as compulsory enhanced training for new equipment
and compulsory practical engagement training.
On the other hand, since China has consistently
expressed its intention of not renouncing the use of force
to Taiwan, the country may make a decision on military
options such as air and maritime blockade, limited use
of force, air and missile operations, and invasion of
Taiwan. If that happens, it is deemed that China will
deter or delay any potential interventions by the United
States. It was reported in December 2021 that according
to an unpublished report submitted from the Ministry
of National Defense of Taiwan to the Legislative Yuan
about the Chinese invasion process for Taiwan, in the
initial phase, China will assemble its military forces on
the Chinese coast under the guise of exercises and use
“cognitive warfare” to cause panic among the Taiwanese
people. China will then gather its naval vessels in the
western Pacific to prevent foreign military intervention.
Next, under the strategy of transformation from exercises
to war, the Rocket and Air Forces will launch ballistic
and cruise missiles to attack Taiwan’s key military
facilities, while the Strategic Support Forces carry out
cyber attacks on Taiwan’s key military systems. Finally,
after gaining sea and air superiority, landing operations
by amphibious assault ships, transport helicopters, and
more will be carried out, thus achieving total control of
Taiwan before foreign forces intervene.


In response to such moves of China, Taiwan under
President Tsai Ing-wen has put forth defense strategy
called as “Resolute Defense and Multi-domain
Deterrence” preventing the invasion from China at
the farthest points possible within its territory with a
multi-layered defense posture, which combines major
equipment such as fighters and vessels with asymmetric
force. The strategy raises a defense concept comprising
“force protection” to contain the initial destruction
caused by the enemy and ensure integrity of military
power through mobility, concealment, dispersion,
deception, camouflage, and other tactics, “decisive battle
in littoral zone” to gain a partial superiority by air assets
and shore-based firepower, and deploying integrated
forces in order to intercept and destroy the enemy’s
landing forces, and “destruction of enemy at landing
beach” to destruct the enemy at breathing, landing
beach and coastal areas by integrating forces, firepower
and prepositioned barriers of three services during the
enemy’s landing and maneuvering operations on shore,
and give them no places to set foot on.[6] This is believed to
be aimed at exhausting the operational capabilities of the
Chinese military and preventing or reducing the landing
of Chinese troops in the face of the overwhelming gap
in military strength between China and Taiwan, as well
as delaying an invasion by the Chinese military and
buying time until intervention by the U.S. military. It
is believed that Taiwan plans to constrain any Chinese
military invasion from a long distance by expanding the
development and production of domestically produced
asymmetric capabilities and long-range weapons, as well
as introducing high-performance, long-range weapons
from the United States, in order to successfully execute
“Resolute Defense and Multi-domain Deterrence.”
Taiwan is currently strengthening its domestic
development of sea and air capabilities, long-range
missiles, and the like. In November 2021, a special
budget bill for the expansion of sea and air capabilities
was passed, and it was decided to invest 240 billion
Taiwan dollars (approximately 950 billion yen) over five
years for the acquisition of self-developed equipment. In
addition to these, Taiwan has decided to acquire from
the United States the “M142” (HIMARS) high mobility
artillery rocket system, the “RGM-84L-4” (Harpoon)
surface-to-ship missile system, and the “AGM-84H”

Note that the 2021 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and the National Defense Report present tactical principles of “resist the enemy on the opposite shore, attack it at sea, destroy it in the littoral
area, and annihilate it on the beachhead.” It will impose multiple interdictions and joint fire strikes to degrade the enemy’s capabilities, disrupt its offensive and prevent it from landing, so as to

In November 2021, a national defense report (the
National Defense Report 2021) was released for the
third time under the Tsai administration, presenting
to the people the defense policy initiatives of the past
two years. While maintaining the defense strategy of
“Resolute Defense and Multi-domain Deterrence,” the
report indicates China’s strong wariness of China’s
gray zone tactics, including a new section on China’s
gray zone threats. The report recognizes China’s gray
zone tactics as a means of “seizing Taiwan without a
fight.” Specific examples raised of China’s gray zone
tactics include cyber attacks through information
gathering, attacks on infrastructure and systems, and
other means, and “cognitive warfare” to create disorder
in Taiwan’s society by manipulating and disturbing
the public’s mentality through the development of
the “Three Warfares” (psychological warfare, public
opinion warfare, and legal warfare) and disseminating
disinformation via social media and other such means.
In response to these threats from China, Taiwan has
expanded its asymmetric capabilities and domestically
produced weapons, purchased weapons from the United
States, strengthened integrated training, enhanced cyber
operations capabilities, enhanced literacy education
on Chinese cognitive warfare, and strengthened its
mobilization system through the establishment of the
“All-out Defense Mobilization Agency.”
In addition to this, Taiwan annually conducts the “Han
Kuang” large-scale military exercise that simulates an
invasion by Chinese forces. It is believed that the Taiwan
military’s defense strategy is verified through this series
of drills. In the “Han Kuang” exercises in recent years,
in addition to anti-landing and interception programs,
drills are conducted with an awareness of anti-gray
zone tactics, such as anti-cyber warfare and joint drills
between the Navy and the Coast Guard Administration.
It is said that training in the “Han Kuang 38” Exercise in
2022 was set based on the aggression against Ukraine,
and included counterattack training using Javelin antitank missiles, combat drills with reservists deployed
on front lines, air defense drills conducted with the
participation of all citizens, and anti-cyber and cognitive
warfare exercises.


**3 Military Balance between China and**
**Taiwan**

While China has continued to increase its defense
budget by a significant margin, Taiwan’s defense
budget, at approximately 409.2 billion Taiwan dollars
for FY2023, has remained almost unchanged for nearly
20 years. China’s announced military budget in the
same year totals approximately 1,553.7 billion yuan,
roughly 17 times the amount of Taiwan’s in terms of
U.S. dollars based on exchange rates announced by the
Taiwanese Central Bank. It is pointed out that China’s
actual defense expenditure has been larger than the
published defense budget, indicating that the ChinaTaiwan defense expenditure gap could be greater. Amid
this situation, President Tsai has ordered an increase in
Taiwan’s defense budget.
The U.S. Department of Defense evaluates the PLA’s
invasion capabilities against Taiwan as the following,
according to the 2022 Report on “Military and Security
Developments Involving the People’s Republic of
China” released in November 2022.
-  The PLA Army organized six combined arms brigades
capable of carrying out amphibious operations,
comprising four brigades in the Eastern Theater the
operational range of which includes Taiwan, and two
brigades in the Southern Theater.
-  The PLA Navy is building up a system to achieve
maritime superiority within the First Island Chain
to deter third-party intervention by deploying new
attack submarines and modern surface combat vessels
with anti-air capabilities. While it has not invested
in landing ships and craft considered to be enough
in number for large-scale assault on Taiwan, it may
intend to make up for the shortage with civilian
transport ships and other vessels.
-  The PLA Air Force has acquired advanced aircraft
to conduct air and ground-attack operations. It
also has a high ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance,
and Reconnaissance) capability to support military
operations in the event of a Taiwan invasion.
Furthermore, it is improving its ability to operate
further from China through enhanced refueling
capabilities.
-  The PLA Rocket Force intends to degrade Taiwan’s
defense and break the will to fight through missile
attacks against high-value targets including Taiwan’s
military facilities

In addition to this, it is pointed out in the report that
the Strategic Support Force would conduct cyber and
psychological warfare in the event of a Taiwan invasion,
and the Joint Logistic Support Force, newly formed
in 2016, would be responsible for integrated logistical
support missions.
The military capabilities of China and Taiwan are
generally characterized as follows:
(1) Regarding ground forces, while China possesses an
overwhelming number of troops, its capability of
landing and invading the main island of Taiwan is
limited at present. In recent years, however, China
has been steadily improving its landing invasion
capabilities through building and commissioning
large landing ships, and it is also improving
transportation capabilities by mobilizing civil
transport ships and the like. Confronting this, in
recent years, Taiwan also has been taking actions
to improve anti-landing capabilities such as by
conducting enhanced training using asymmetric
weapons including Javelin anti-tank missiles, and
combat drills with reservists and would-be draftees
from conscription who will be reinstated in the future.
(2) In regard to China’s naval and air forces, the
PLA Navy and PLA Air Force are being rapidly
reinforced both in terms of quality and quantity. This
includes the launching of the second domestic-built
aircraft carrier which reportedly could be equipped
with an electromagnetic catapult system, and
operational deployment of the J-20 fifth-generation
fighter. While Taiwan strives to enhance its naval
and air forces by passing special budgets for them,
the capability gap is expanding in an advantageous
direction for China.
(3) Regarding missile strike capabilities, China has
many missiles including short-range ballistic
missiles (SRBMs) and multiple launch rockets
and other assets with enough range to strike
Taiwan. Although Taiwan is enhancing its missile


defense capabilities such as by upgrading its PAC2 system imported from the United States and
newly acquiring the PAC-3 system, it is pointed
out that the ability to counter enemy’s saturation
attacks is limited. In addition, Taiwan attempts to
enhance stand-off attack capabilities, including
by developing and producing long-range cruising
missiles such as the “Hsiung Sheng” surface-tosurface missile, which is said to have a range of
1,200 km, and it is considered to be aiming to
introduce the AGM-158 long-range air-to-surface
missile from the United States.
Comparison of military capabilities should be made
based not only on the troop strength and the performance
and quantity of equipment but also on various other
factors such as the purpose and aspects of assumed
military operations, operational arrangements, the skill
level of personnel, and logistics. Nevertheless, the
overall military balance between China and Taiwan is
rapidly tilting to China’s favor.
China has intensified its coercive military activities
around Taiwan, and concerns about the peace and
stability of the Taiwan Strait, which is indispensable to
security and prosperity in the international community,
are rapidly growing not only in the Indo-Pacific region,
including Japan, but also in the entire international
community.
Recognizing that unilateral changes to the status quo
by force are a challenge not only for the Indo-Pacific
region but one common to the entire world, Japan, in
cooperation with its ally, the United States, like-minded
countries, and the international community, will pay
close attention to the relevant situation with a greater
sense of crisis.

launched ballistic missiles and other missiles with
an unprecedented frequency. North Korea resumed
launching intercontinental-range ballistic missile
(ICBM)-class ballistic missiles from February 2022
and passed a law stipulating the terms for using nuclear
weapons in September; Chairman Kim insisted, “we
can never abandon nuclear weapons.” After launching
ICBM-class “Hwasong-17” on November 18, North
Korea stated that it had verified its performance clearly
and would continue to enhance and strengthen its nuclear
arsenal. Meanwhile, North Korea has been concentrating
on enhancing nuclear and missile related technologies
and operational capabilities. For example, ballistic
missiles flying with irregular trajectories and missiles
referred to as “hypersonic missile” are repeatedly
launched. In addition, operationalization of long-range
cruise missiles is being pursued with a view to arming
them with “tactical nuclear weapons.”
North Korea has continued to promote the
development of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs)
and ballistic missiles and enhancement of their
operational capabilities by conducting six nuclear tests
and repeatedly launching ballistic missiles as a nuclear
delivery system so far. It is assessed that North Korea
already possesses the technological capabilities to mount
a miniaturized nuclear warhead on its ballistic missiles,
whose range includes Japan and is able to attack Japan
with such a missile. Still, it will continue to make further
efforts to maintain and enhance its military capabilities
and combat readiness, including its nuclear and missile
capabilities, as stated above.
Moreover, it is probable that North Korea promotes
enhancement of cyber troops and keeps special
operations forces on a large scale. While the defense
budget of North Korea was said to make up 15.9%
of its annual budget according to the statement of the
Supreme People’s Assembly in January 2023, this
seems to be only a part of the actual defense budget.
While facing serious economic difficulties without any
improvement in its human rights situation to date, North


**1 General Situation**

Kim Jong-un, Chairman of the State Affairs Commission
of North Korea (hereinafter “Chairman Kim”)[1] made it
clear that he adhered to the so-called “Byungjin line”
policy of simultaneous economic and nuclear forces
development as well as “Songun politics”[2] in May 2016.
In fact, North Korea pushed ahead and conducted three
nuclear tests and launched numerous ballistic missiles
from 2016 to 2017 and stated that it had completed
development of the state nuclear force. This intensified
sanctions based on resolutions of the United Nations
Security Council and other independent sanctions by
several countries including Japan and the United States.
On the other hand, in early 2018, Chairman Kim
declared that the “Byungjin line” had been successfully
carried out and announced the “new strategic line”
in which it would “fully concentrate efforts on the
construction of a socialist economy.” Chairman Kim
decided to discontinue “nuclear tests and intercontinental
ballistic rocket test-fire” and announced the nuclear test
ground had been blown up, while momentum towards
dialogue between the United States or the ROK and
North Korea grew. He also expressed during the summit
meeting with the U.S. in June 2018 the intention to work
towards denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
However, the February 2019 U.S.-North Korea
summit meeting ended without the two sides reaching an
agreement. In December of the same year, Chairman Kim
announced the intention to continue developing strategic
weapons until the United States rolled back its hostile
policy towards North Korea. Furthermore, Chairman
Kim showed his hostile stance towards the United States
in January 2021 and stated to “further strengthen the
nuclear war deterrent,” showing the intention to continue
developing nuclear and missile capabilities.
After that, North Korea criticizes the U.S. attitude
towards it and continuously states its intention to
strengthen military power including nuclear weapons
as “self-defense”. During 2022, North Korea repeatedly

As of May 2016, Kim Jong-un held the position of the First Chairman of the National Defense Commission. At the Supreme People’s Assembly in June 2016, the National Defense Commission was
renamed the State Affairs Commission, and Kim Jong-un assumed the position of Chairman of the State Affairs Commission. Reflecting this change, “Chairman of the State Affairs Commission” is
used for the title of Kim Jong-un throughout this white paper.

In a written decision of the 7th Congress of the KWP, “Report on the Work of the KWP Central Committee” (May 8, 2016), it has been defined as a basic form of socialist politics that leads the great

Korea continues to heavily allocate its resources to
military affairs. In addition, North Korea has repeatedly
used provocative rhetoric and behavior against relevant
countries, including Japan.
North Korea’s military activities described above
pose an even more grave and imminent threat to Japan’s
national security than ever before and significantly
undermine the peace and security of the region and the
international community.
Needless to say, North Korea’s development and
possession of nuclear weapons cannot be tolerated. At
the same time, sufficient attention needs to be paid to
its development and deployment of ballistic missiles,
military confrontation of the Korean Peninsula and
proliferation of WMDs and missiles. As for North
Korea’s abduction of Japanese nationals, utmost efforts
continue to be made to realize the return of all abductees
to Japan as quickly as possible by close cooperation with
related countries, including the United States.

**2 Military Posture**


Korea.
Furthermore, in order to maintain its regime, North
Korea is believed to be planning to build its own nuclear
deterrence and improve capability to respond to conflicts
with U.S. and ROK forces by concentrating on building
up its WMD and ballistic missile arsenal, etc. In recent
years, North Korea has repeatedly launched short-range
ballistic missiles (SRBMs) and other missiles capable
of flying at low altitudes with irregular trajectories in
a simultaneous process of promoting the development
of ICBM-class ballistic missiles covering a range of
the whole U.S. territory, rapidly improving related
technologies and operational capabilities and diversifying
their launch platforms to include rail-launched and
submarine-launched types. At the same time, North
Korea has been striving to expand more practical
SRBM capabilities. Furthermore, since Chairman Kim
mentioned the development of “ultra-modern tactical
nuclear weapons including intermediate-range cruise
missiles” in January 2021, North Korea announced that
it had succeeded in conducting test launches of longrange cruise missiles and launched ballistic missiles
in what it called training for “tactical nuclear weapons
operation units.”
The background for North Korea’s series of
development and launches appears to be that in addition
to acquiring nuclear deterrent capabilities through the
possession of nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic
missiles for the maintenance and survival of the regime,
North Korea aims to acquire the means to be able to
respond to an armed conflict that could occur between
itself and United States as well as ROK forces in which
conventional forces or tactical nuclear weapons are
used.[4] North Korea repeatedly stated it would enhance its
military power including nuclear weapons and missiles
according to the “five-year plan for the development of
the defense science and the weapon system” (hereinafter
“five-year plan”) said to have been presented at the
8th Congress of the Korean Workers Party (KWP) in
January 2021,[5] and it is likely that it is focusing efforts

**(1) General Situation**
North Korea has continued to enhance its military forces
consistently in the situation of south-north division,[3]
however, reduction in military assistance from the former
Soviet bloc due to the end of the Cold War, its sluggish
economy and modernization of ROK Forces have resulted
in much of its equipment being outdated, and there is
significant qualitative disparity between North Korea’s
conventional forces and those of the ROK’s military
and U.S. Forces Korea. Nevertheless, North Korea’s
military forces are comprised mainly of ground forces,
with a total troop strength reaching roughly 1.28 million
personnel. It still maintains a large-scale military force,
including artillery units deployed near the DMZ. North
Korea also retains special operations forces and the like
on a large scale for information gathering and sabotage.
In addition, many military underground facilities seem
to exist all over the land, which is a peculiarity of North


North Korea has been building up its military capabilities in accordance with the Four Military Guidelines, consisting of extensive training for all soldiers, modernizing all military forces, arming the
entire population, and fortifying the entire country, adopted at the 5th plenary meeting of the 4th KWP Central Committee in 1962.

For example, at the 8th Congress of the KWP in January 2021, Chairman Kim stated that North Korea would “develop tactical nuclear weapons which can be used for various missions according
to the purpose of operational duty and target of strike in a modern war” and “thoroughly contain, control and handle various military threats on the Korean peninsula which inevitably accompany
the nuclear threat on our own initiative.” He also stated in September 2022 that North Korea “will be enhancing tactical nuclear operation measures relentlessly, realize higher level of diversity of
applying means, and strengthen nuclear combat posture from multiple directions.”

There was no direct reference to the name “five-year plan for defense scientific development and weapons system development” in North Korea’s announcement at the same Congress of the KWP
in January 2021. However, when there was an announcement of the launch of long-range cruise missiles on September 13 of the same year, the North Korean media mentioned it publicly for the
first time by stating that this missile development project was significant for “achieving the key objectives of the five-year plan for the development of defense science and weapon system presented


-----

on research and development (R&D) and enhancement
of operational capabilities for various weapons under
this five-year plan.

**(2) Military Capabilities**
The North Korean Army comprises about 1.10 million
personnel, and roughly two-thirds of them seem to be
deployed along the DMZ. The main body of the army
is infantry, but the army also maintains armored forces
including at least 3,500 tanks and artillery. North Korea
is believed to deploy long-range artillery along the DMZ,
such as 240 mm multiple rocket launchers and 170 mm
self-propelled artillery guns, which can reach cities and
bases in the northern part of the ROK including Seoul.
The Navy retains about 790 ships and boats with
a total displacement of approximately 100,000 tons
and is chiefly comprised of small naval vessels such
as high-speed missile craft. Also, it has about 20 of
the former model Romeo-class submarines, about 30
midget submarines and about 140 air cushioned landing
crafts, the latter two of which are believed to be used
for infiltration and other actions of the special operations
forces.
The Air Force has approximately 550 combat aircraft,
most of which are out-of-date models made in China
or the former Soviet Union. However, some fourthgeneration aircraft such as MiG-29 fighters and Su25 attack aircraft are also included. North Korea has
a large number of outdated An-2 transport aircraft as
well, which are believed to be used for transportation of
special operations forces.
Moreover, North Korea retains a large-scale special
operations force[6] as so-called asymmetric capabilities.
Also, it is likely in recent years that it has been
strengthening its cyber forces as asymmetric forces as
well in order to steal military secret intelligence and
funds for developing nuclear weapons and missiles, and
develop capabilities to attack critical infrastructure of
other countries.


**3 WMD and Missiles**

At the 8th Congress of the KWP held in January 2021,
Chairman Kim indicated a stance of further enhancing
nuclear and missile capabilities and continuously
improving North Korea’s military power. He referred
specifically, as future objectives, to the advancement
of nuclear technology including the development of
“tactical nuclear weapons,” preemptive and retaliatory
nuclear strike capabilities and development of various
weapons including “hypersonic gliding flight warheads”
and submarine-launched and ground-launched solidfuel intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). It is
said that the “five-year plan” was presented at the same
Congress, and since that year, North Korea actually has
been improving related technologies and operational
capabilities based on this plan, including the successive
launches of ballistic missiles flying with irregular
trajectories, missiles called “hypersonic missile” and
new ICBM-class ballistic missiles.
The launches of ballistic missiles and other missiles
by North Korea have continued; moreover, from early
2022, in particular, it has forced through launches with an
unprecedented frequency. North Korea resumed launches
of intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM)-class and
longer-range ballistic missiles including new ICBMclass ballistic missiles which it had not launched since
2018. At the same time, North Korea likely intends to
enhance further surprise attack capabilities, complicating
indication of warning detection and interception of its
missiles, by pursuing the operationalization of ballistic
missiles that can fly at low altitudes with irregular
trajectories as well as by launching these missiles
from various platforms such as Transporter-ErectorLaunchers (TELs)[7], submarines and trains. In addition
to this, it is also a recent distinctive feature that North
Korea likely aims to enhance and display its operational
capabilities by escalating provocation, implying actual
war situations; for example, it repeatedly launched
ballistic missiles almost every day in training of “tactical
nuclear weapons operation units” from late September
to October 2022.

**Chapter**


James Thurman, then Commander of the U.S. Forces Korea, stated, “North Korea possesses the world’s largest special operations force of over 60,000” in his speech at the Association of U.S.
Army in October 2012. Additionally, the 2022 Defense White Paper of the ROK notes about North Korea’s Special operations force, “The forces are estimated at approximately 200,000 strong.”

The signs of a launch from a fixed launcher are easy for the adversary to detect and are vulnerable to attack by the adversary. TEL was developed mainly by the former Soviet Union, among others,
in order to make the detection of launch signs more difficult and increase survivability. According to the U.S. DIA’s “North Korea Military Power” of October 2021, North Korea possesses a maximum
of 100 TELs for Scud B and Scud C, 100 TELs for Nodongs, and 50 TELs for IRBMs (Musudans). As for a TEL-mounted missile launch, it is deemed difficult to detect individual specific signs in
advance concerning the detailed location and timing of the launch. This is because it is operated by being mounted and transported on a TEL, and furthermore, military-related underground facilities


-----

In addition, given the technological maturity obtained
through a series of nuclear tests, North Korea is assessed
to possesses the technological capabilities to mount a
miniaturized nuclear warhead on its ballistic missiles,
at least such ballistic missiles as Nodong and Scud-ER,
whose range includes Japan and is able to attack Japan
with such a missile. Still, it repeatedly states the intention
to enhance its nuclear forces further.
Recent remarkable development of nuclear and
missile-related technologies by North Korea cannot be
overlooked for the security of Japan and the region. Such
military trends in North Korea pose an even more grave
and imminent threat to Japan’s national security than
ever before and significantly undermine the peace and
security of the region and the international community.
Additionally, such development poses a serious challenge
to the entire international community with regard to the
non-proliferation of weapons, including WMDs.

**(1) Nuclear Weapons**
a. The Current Status of the Nuclear Weapons Program
Considering that North Korea has conducted six nuclear
tests so far, it is conceivable that North Korea has made
considerable progress in its nuclear weapons program.
With regard to plutonium, a fissile material[8] that
can be used for nuclear weapons,[9] North Korea has
suggested its production and extraction on several
instances. Recently, it has been pointed out that the
nuclear reactor in Yongbyon that was believed to have
been out of operation since 2018 restarted operations in
July 2021.[10] As the restarting of the reactor could lead
to the production and extraction of plutonium by North
Korea, those activities are causes of great concern.
As for highly enriched uranium that can also be
used for nuclear weapons, in June 2009, North Korea
declared the commencement of uranium enrichment.
In November 2010, North Korea disclosed its uranium
enrichment facility to American nuclear specialists


and later announced that it was operating a uranium
enrichment plant equipped with thousands of centrifuges.
The expansion of this uranium enrichment plant has
been suggested in recent years; in this regard, North
Korea could have increased its enrichment capabilities.
Furthermore, it is also pointed out that there are some
uranium enrichment facilities that have not been
disclosed by North Korea. The series of North Korean
behaviors related to uranium enrichment indicate the
possibility of the development of nuclear weapons using
highly enriched uranium in addition to plutonium.[11] In
general, facilities used for uranium enrichment are more
secretive in appearance than reactors used for plutonium
production, and it is difficult to ascertain their activities
from the outside. On the other hand, plutonium has a
smaller critical mass than uranium, and it is pointed out
that it is easier to make nuclear weapons smaller and
lighter. In light of both these advantages, North Korea
may continue to promote the development of both
plutonium and uranium types of nuclear weapons.
North Korea conducted nuclear tests on October 9,
2006, May 25, 2009, February 12, 2013, January 6, 2016,
September 9, 2016 and September 3, 2017. It is highly
likely that North Korea has made strides in its nuclear
weapons program, while miniaturizing nuclear weapons
to be loaded on ballistic missile, by collecting the
necessary data through these nuclear tests. For example,
in September, 2017, it was announced that Chairman Kim
had visited North Korea’s Nuclear Weapons Institute and
had seen a hydrogen bomb capable of being loaded onto
an ICBM, in addition to which, following North Korea’s
sixth nuclear test that was forced through on the same
day, North Korea announced that it “successfully carried
out a test of H-bomb for ICBM.”[12]

In regard to miniaturization of nuclear weapons small
enough to be mounted on a ballistic missile, considering
the fact that the United States, the former Soviet Union,
the United Kingdom, France, and China succeeded in

8 Plutonium is synthetically produced in a nuclear reactor by irradiating uranium with neutrons, and then extracting it from used nuclear fuel at a reprocessing facility. Plutonium is then used as a
basic material for the production of nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, in order to use uranium for nuclear weapons, it is necessary to extract uranium 235 (U235), a highly fissile material, from natural
uranium. This process is called enrichment. Generally, a large-scale enrichment facility that combines thousands of centrifuges is used to boost the U235 concentration to nuclear weapon levels
(over 90%).

9 North Korea announced in October 2003 that it had completed the reprocessing of 8,000 used fuel rods that contain plutonium, and in May 2005 that it had completed extraction of an additional
8,000 used fuel rods. The 2022 Defense White Paper of the ROK estimates that North Korea possesses around 70 kg of plutonium.

10 According to the IAEA’s “Application of Safeguards in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea” published in August 2021 and others. Indicated by a Member State in the interim report of the
Panel of Experts of the UN Security Council Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) Sanctions Committee released in October 2022.

11 The 2022 Defense White Paper of the ROK assesses that North Korea possesses a substantial amount of highly enriched uranium (HEU). It has been noted that a uranium enrichment facility different
from the one in Yongbyon exists in Kangson.

12 The yield of the sixth nuclear weapons test in 2017 was estimated to be the largest ever, with a maximum yield of approximately 160 kt. Given the size of the estimated yield, the possibility cannot
be discounted that the test was of a hydrogen bomb. North Korea also insisted that its fourth nuclear test, conducted in January 2016, was a hydrogen bomb test. However, given that the yield of

light of the current state that the ROK assumed our
undoubted enemy” in December 2022. North Korea has
repeatedly stated that the ROK under the stern policy
of the Yoon Suk-yeol administration confronting North
Korea will not be excluded from potential targets of
its nuclear attacks. Furthermore, North Korea shows
its stance to pursue development of tactical nuclear
weapons with a view to dealing with a possible armed
conflict on the Korean Peninsula.
In September 2022, North Korea passed “the law on
the state policy on the nuclear forces” that stipulates
mission and command and control of its nuclear forces
as well as conditions of using its nuclear weapons. The
law notes the main mission of nuclear forces is “to deter
a war.” If deterrence fails, its nuclear forces “shall carry
out an operational mission for repulsing hostile forces’
aggression and attacks and achieving decisive victory
of the war.” Chairman Kim insisted on the justification
of North Korea’s nuclear development, saying that
by promulgating the law, “our country’s status as a
nuclear-weapons state has become irreversible” and
“no one can accuse us falsely or question about our
nuclear forces.” Furthermore, it is stipulated in the
law that nuclear weapons can be used when an attack
deemed imminent, regardless of whether it is nuclear
or conventional, on “leadership” or “important strategic
objects” and, in particular, that a “nuclear strike” will
be conducted automatically and immediately in the case
that “command and control system over the state nuclear
forces” are exposed to any danger. From these factors, it
is possible that North Korea assumes a possible use of
nuclear weapons in an actual combat.
In fact, North Korea has repeatedly launched missiles,
allegedly, for practical training; for example, it launched
missiles in “tactical nuclear operation units” training
several times from late September to October 2022 and
exploded test warheads simulating nuclear warheads
above the targets in what was called “comprehensive
tactical training for simulated nuclear counterstrike”
among others in March 2023. North Korea also announced
in March 2023 that Chairman Kim received explanation
about tactical nuclear weapons from the department in
charge and “instructed about weaponizing of nuclear
weapons,” giving direction to expand the production of
weapon-grade nuclear materials and nuclear weapons.

Object claimed to be a hydrogen bomb loaded on ICBM [AFP/Jiji]

acquiring such technology by as early as the 1960s as
well as the North Korean technological maturity that
is estimated to have been reached through previous
six nuclear tests, it is assessed that North Korea has
already achieved necessary miniaturization of its nuclear
weapons to fit ballistic missiles, whose range includes
Japan. There have also been reports that North Korea
possesses approximately 20 nuclear warheads—overall
enough fissile material to produce 45 to 55 nuclear
warheads.[13]

Furthermore, it is likely that North Korea has been
preparing for additional nuclear tests, as has been
suggested that North Korea has been working on
restoring its northern nuclear test site since March 2022,
which it publicly announced it had blown up in 2018.
b. Background of the Nuclear Program and Future Outlook
North Korea’s ultimate goal appears to be maintaining
its existing regime. It has been developing nuclear
weapons to accomplish this goal through constructing its
own nuclear deterrence to counter U.S. threats, including
threats with nuclear weapons. These perceptions are
obvious as can be seen in Chairman Kim’s speech that
North Korea can never abandon its nuclear weapons
because the objective of the United States is to collapse
“our government.”[14] It is likely that North Korea will
continue to focus on advancing development of nuclear
weapons and long-range missiles capable of attacking
the whole U.S. territory in order to acquire deterrence
against the United States.
Meanwhile Chairman Kim showed his perception
that it is revealed that “the importance and necessity of
a mass-production of tactical nuclear weapons” in the

**(2) Biological and Chemical Weapons**
North Korea is an extremely closed regime. In addition,
most materials and technology used for manufacturing
biological and chemical weapons are for both military
and civilian uses, which in turn facilitates camouflage.
For these reasons, details of the status of North Korea’s
biological and chemical weapons development and
arsenals are unclear. However, with regard to chemical
weapons, North Korea is suspected to have several
facilities capable of producing chemical agents and
already a substantial stockpile of such agents. North


Furthermore, it is possible that North Korea will
conduct additional nuclear tests in the near future to arm
ICBM-class ballistic missiles with multiple warheads
and operationalize tactical nuclear weapons pursuing
for further miniaturization of nuclear weapons.[15] It is
necessary to look closer at North Korea’s actions in
the future under its policy to enhance nuclear forces
both qualitatively and quantitively as fast as possible,
accelerating movement against denuclearization.

(a) New SRBMs first launched since 2019
North Korea has launched various kinds of shortrange ballistic missiles different from traditional liquid
fuel propelled type ones such as Scud missiles since
2019. From published images, it can be ascertained
that these SRBMs were launched from a wheeled-drive
or continuous-tracked TEL or railway cars with radial
exhausts a typical characteristic of solid fuel propelled
engines. Many of these SRBMs are being launched
towards the east coast of North Korea. It is assumed that
North Korea aims to advance operational capabilities, as
some images that show impact on a specific target have
been released.

16 The 2022 Defense White Paper of the ROK pointed out that North Korea began the production of chemical weapons in 1980s and has stored around 2,500-5,000 tons of them. Furthermore, it
is estimated that North Korea has capabilities to cultivate and produce various kind of biological weapons such as anthrax, smallpox, and the plague on its own. North Korea ratified the Biological
Weapons Convention in 1987 but has not acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention.

17 According to “Jane’s Sentinel Security Assessment China and Northeast Asia” (accessed in March 2023) North Korea possesses 700 to 1,000 ballistic missiles in total, 45% of which are presumed
to be Scud-class, 45% Nodong-class, and the remaining 10% other intermediate- and long-range ballistic missiles.

9, July 25, and August 6, 2019, January 27, June 5,
October 1, October 6,[20] and October 14, 2022, as well
as on March 19 and March 27, 2023, are all presumed
to be the same system and flew up to approximately 800
km. In terms of the shape, the launched missiles have
a similarity to that of the Russian short-range ballistic
missile “Iskander.” It is also presumed that this missile is
able to fly at a lower altitude than conventional ballistic
missiles with an irregular trajectory and can be mounted
with a nuclear warhead.[21]

North Korea also launched two SRBMs on both
September 15, 2021 and January 14, 2022. Based on
images released by North Korea, these missiles were
launched from railway cars that appear to have been
converted from ordinary freight cars. They have external
similarities with SRBM A, and it is possible that they
were developed based on that missile. North Korea has
announced that it was a firing exercise by the “railwayborne missile regiment” and has also expressed its
intention to expand the units in the future.
In this way, North Korea has been pursuing the
operationalization of the SRBM A, while diversifying
its launch platforms, towards its mass production and
deployment, and future developments need to be closely
watched.
(ii) SRBM B
The SRBMs, described by North Korea as “new
weapon” or as “tactical guided weapon,” launched on
August 10, and August 16, 2019, March 21, 2020, and
January 17 and June 5,[19] 2022, are all presumed to be
the same system and flew up to approximately 400 km.
It is also presumed that this missile is able to fly at a
lower altitude than conventional ballistic missiles with
an irregular trajectory.
(iii) SRBM C
The SRBMs, described by North Korea as “super-large
multiple rocket launcher,”[22] launched on August 24,
September 10, October 31, and November 28, 2019;
March 2, March 9, and March 29, 2020; May 12, June
5,[19] September 29, October 6,[20] October 9, November 3,
22 November 17, and December 31, 2022; January 1,
and February 20, 2023, are all presumed to be the same
system and flew up to approximately 400 km. Some


of the intervals between launches were estimated less
than 1 minute, suggesting that North Korea is trying
to improve the continuous fire capability required for
saturation attacks and the like. Chairman Kim mentioned
that they can be loaded with tactical nuclear warheads.[23]
Regarding TELs, various types can be confirmed in
images published by North Korea.
(iv) SRBM D
It is pointed out the SRBMs (North Korea calls a “newtype tactical guided missile”)[18] launched on March 25,
2021 and September 28, 2022, are presumed to be the
same system, and they were developed based on the
SRBM A. They are capable of flying at lower altitudes than
conventional ballistic missiles with irregular trajectories,
and their maximum range could reach about 750 km.
In addition, North Korea carried out two launches
of what could have been SRBMs on July 31, 2019
and another two a couple of days later, on August 2.
Furthermore, the analysis of the details of two missiles
launched on November 2, 2022 that flew approximately
150 km and 200 km respectively is still ongoing.
(b) Scud
The Scud is a liquid fuel propellant single-stage ballistic
missile and is operated on a TEL.
Scud B is an SRBM with a range of 300 km, and Scud
C is an SRBM with an extended range of 500 km. It is
believed that North Korea has manufactured and retained
them and has exported them to the Middle East and other
countries. On November 3, 2022, North Korea launched
three Scud C missiles with an estimated flying distance
of about 500 km each. North Korea announced later
that the missile launches including these were a part of
a “countermeasure military exercise” against the U.S.ROK joint air training exercise Vigilant Storm.
The Scud-ER (Extended Range) is a ballistic missile
that has an extended range due to the extension of the
Scud’s body as well as the reduction in weight of the
warhead, among other factors. The range of the Scud
ER is estimated to reach approximately 1,000 km, and
it appears that a part of Japan falls within this range.
Regarding the two ballistic missiles that were launched
on December 18, 2022, North Korea announced that
their launch was for an important test for development of

**Chapter**


19 It is presumed that the eight ballistic missiles launched on June 5, 2022, were all SRBMs, including SRBM A, SRBM B, and SRBM C.
20 It is presumed that the first ballistic missile that was launched on October 6, 2022 and flew approximately 350 km was an SRBM C, and the second that flew approximately 800 km was an SRBM A.

21 According to the Congressional Research Service’s “North Korea’s Nuclear Weapons and Missile Programs” (updated January 2023) and others.
22 It is presumed that of the six ballistic missiles launched on November 3, 2022, the two which flew approximately 350 km were both SRBM C.
23 Chairman Kim attended the event to “present” the SRBM C to the 6th plenary meeting of 8th Central Committee of the KWP in December 2022, and stated this missile’s range covered the whole


-----

a reconnaissance satellite and released images. These
missiles could be ballistic missiles based on Scud-ER.
Furthermore, North Korea is also developing a
ballistic missile that appears to be an improvement of
the Scud missile. This ballistic missile was launched on
May 29, 2017. A day later, North Korea announced that
it had successfully conducted the new development and
test launch of a ballistic rocket incorporating a precision
navigation guidance system.
In addition, the images released by North Korea show
that the ballistic missile was launched from a continuous
tracked TEL and had what appears to be small wings of
its warhead that are different from the characteristics of
existing Scud missiles, while the shape other than the
warhead and length are similar.
Another similarity is that it can be confirmed that the
missile has straight-line exhausts, a typical characteristic
of a liquid fuel-propelled engine. It has also been noted
that this ballistic missile is equipped with a Maneuverable
Re-entry Vehicle (MaRV).[24] North Korea is believed to
be improving the accuracy of its ballistic missile attacks.
(c) Nodong
The Nodong is a liquid fuel propelled single-stage ballistic
missile and is operated on a TEL. It is assessed to have a
range of about 1,300 km, reaching almost all of Japan.
Although the details of Nodong’s performance have
not been confirmed, Nodong may not be able to carry
out precise strikes on specific target installations, as
it is likely based on Scud technology. However, it has
been suggested that North Korea is working to increase
the Nodong’s accuracy. A launch aimed at enhancing
accuracy by improving the shape of the warhead
(whose range is deemed to reach approximately 1,500
km through the weight reduction of the warhead) was
confirmed for the first time in the images published by
North Korea a day after the launch of one Scud and two
Nodong missiles on July 19, 2016.
(d) SLBM
North Korea is believed to possess one Gorae-class
submarine (displacement of approximately 1,500 tons) that
is capable of carrying and launching a single submarine

launched ballistic missile (SLBM) and is being operated
mainly as a test vessel. In addition, North Korea is believed
to be upgrading its existing Romeo-class submarines to
carry SLBMs. In January 2021, Chairman Kim mentioned
the goal of possessing nuclear submarines.
North Korea has been developing SLBMs to be
mounted on these submarines, and in May 2015, it
announced the first successful test launch of an SLBM.[25]
It is deemed that through developing the SLBM and
a new submarine to carry it, North Korea intends to
diversify its ballistic missile attack capabilities and
improve survivability.
(i) SLBM “Pukguksong”
Following North Korea’s launch of an SLBM (the
“Pukguksong” type according to the North Korean
designation) from a Gorae-class submarine on April 23,
2016, it launched the same missile a total of three times
in July and August of the same year.
Judging from the images and footage that it has
made public so far, North Korea may have succeeded
in operating the “cold launch system,” in which the
missile is ignited after it is ejected into the air. Moreover,
it appears, based on observations such as the shape of
the flame coming out of the missile and the color of the
smoke, that the solid fuel-propelled system was adopted.
The “Pukguksong” missile that was launched in
August 2016 flew about 500 km but was on a somewhat
higher trajectory compared to the normal altitude of a
ballistic missile with a firing range of 500 km. If it were
launched on a nominal trajectory, the firing range is
expected to surpass 1,000 km.
(ii) SLBM “Pukguksong-3”
On October 2, 2019, North Korea launched one SLBM
(referred to as the “Pukguksong-3” by North Korea)
different from the “Pukguksong” SLBM. This SLBM is
estimated to have flown about 450 km. As it reached a
maximum altitude of about 900 km, it is surmised to have
been launched with a lofted trajectory. If launched with
a nominal trajectory, it is estimated that it could have a
range of approximately 2,000 km. The radial exhausts, a
typical characteristic of solid fuel-propelled engines are

**Chapter**


24 According to “Jane’s Sentinel Security Assessment China and Northeast Asia” (accessed in March 2023), the launch on May 29, 2017 was presumed to have been the first launch of a short-range
ballistic missile based on a Scud missile, equipped with a MaRV, suggesting that North Korea has made advances in its precision guidance systems.

25 The MOD has presumed five instances of SLBM launches by North Korea on April 23 2016 (Pukguksong type), July 9 2016 (Pukguksong type), August 24 2016 (Pukguksong type), October 2 2019
(Pukguksong-3 type), October 19 2021 (a new type of SLBM), May 7 2022 (a new type of SLBM) and September 25 2022 (a new type of SLBM). Among these, the launches in 2016, 2021 and
May 2022 (five in total) were evaluated to have been from a Gorae-class submarine.

In addition, on May 9, 2015, North Korea announced that it had succeeded in a test launch of an SLBM. On January 8, 2016, it released footage of an SLBM test launch that appeared to be different
from the one unveiled in May 2015.

April 25, 2022 [AFP/Jiji]


identifiable on images published by North Korea. The
SLBM in question could potentially have been launched
from an underwater launch test equipment.
In addition, North Korea showcased two possible new
types of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM)
referred to as “Pukguksong-4” and “Pukguksong-5” in
the military parades in October 2020 and January 2021
respectively. In addition, an exhibition titled Defence
Development Exhibition “Self-Defence-2021” held
in October 2021 featured an exhibited item that had
external similarities to the “Pukguksong-5.”[26]

(iii) New Type of SLBM
North Korea’s new types of SLBM launched on October
19, 2021, May 7 and September 25, 2022 flew up to
approx. 650 km. Two SLBMs are believed to have been
launched from a Gorae-class submarine in October 2021
and May 2022 respectively and flew with an irregular
trajectory at a low altitude before falling into the Sea
of Japan. The trajectory of the October 2021 launch
in particular is believed to have been a so-called pullup trajectory, in which the SLBM descended once,
maneuvered again and then ascended. The launch in
September 2022 is assumed to have been carried out
using an underwater launching test device from inland
underwater. On this point, North Korea announced later
that launch training for a ballistic missile loaded with
simulated tactical nuclear warhead was conducted at a
“water reservoir underwater launch site” in the north
western region and revealed the existence of a “water
reservoir underwater launch site construction” plan.
Based on images released by North Korea, it is


possible that the missile was developed based on the
SRBM A, as it has external similarities with that missile.
(e) Ballistic Missile Modified from the SLBM
North Korea launched a ballistic missile on both
February 12 and May 21, 2017, both of which appeared
to be a modified version of the SLBM “Pukguksong”
for ground launch (referred to by North Korea as
“Pukguksong-2”). This ballistic missile is estimated to
have flown approximately 500 km on both occasions,
with somewhat higher trajectories than normal. If it were
launched with a nominal trajectory, the firing range is
assessed to surpass 1,000 km. A day after the launch in
February of the same year, North Korea announced that
it was developed as a ground-to-ground ballistic missile
based on the results of the August 2016 SLBM launch.
It also announced a day after the launch in May 2017
that it had again successfully conducted the test launch
of the missile and that Chairman Kim had authorized its
“operational deployment.”
Moreover, the launch by a “cold launch system,” in
which the missile is ignited after it is ejected into the
air from a continuous-tracked TEL and radial exhausts,
a typical characteristic of solid fuel-propelled engines
can be confirmed from each of the images that North
Korea released. It has the characteristics of appearing to
be using “cold launch system” and solid fuel-propelled
engines in common with the SLBM “Pukguksong.”
(f) Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM)-Class
To date, North Korea has launched four liquid fuelpropelled IRBM-class ballistic missiles (referred to by
North Korea as “Hwasong-12”). One of these ballistic


26 In addition, a missile that could be a new type of SLBM and is believed to not have been publicly announced in North Korea was shown at the military parade on April 25, 2022. However, there was


-----

missiles was launched on each of May 14, 2017 and
January 31, 2022, and based on their flight patterns,
it is presumed that they were launched with a lofted
trajectory. Had they been launched with a nominal
trajectory, the maximum firing range is assessed to
be close to approximately 5,000 km. In addition, the
straight-line exhausts, a typical characteristic of a liquid
fuel propelled engine can be confirmed from the images
released by North Korea a day after the launch.
On August 29 and September 15, 2017, single
“Hwasong-12” missiles were launched and flew
over Japan’s territory in the vicinity of the Oshima
Peninsula and Cape Erimo. In view of their flight paths,
“Hwasong-12” missiles appear to demonstrate a certain
level of function as an IRBM. Also, the fact that missiles
that overflew Japan were launched in succession in
a short time period would suggest that North Korea is
steadily improving its ballistic missile capabilities.
Furthermore, in the May and August launches of
the same year, it was confirmed that the missiles were
launched after being separated from the wheeled-drive
TEL. However, in the September launch, it was confirmed
that the missile was launched while still mounted on the
wheeled-drive TEL.[27]

North Korea also launched a missile passing over
Aomori Prefecture, Japan on October 4, 2022. It is
presumed that this missile was a ballistic missile with a
range over that of an IRBM, based on the flight distance
of around 4,600 km achieved at that time. North Korea
announced later that a “new type of surface-to-surface
long-range ballistic missile” was launched. From images
released at the time, although the date of photography
was not mentioned, the straight-line exhausts, a typical
characteristic of a liquid fuel propelled engine and the
TEL similar to ones for the “Hwasong-12” missile were
visually confirmed. On the other hand, since the shape of
the warhead and engine structure were different to that of
the “Hwasong-12,” the possibility that the missile North
Korea launched at that time was a new type of IRBMclass ballistic missile cannot be ruled out.
(g) Intercontinental-Range Ballistic Missile (ICBM)-Class
(i) ICBM-class “Hwasong-14”
North Korea launched ICBM-class ballistic missiles,
referred to by North Korea as “Hwasong-14,” on July 4


and 28, 2017. From the flight pattern, it is presumed that
the two missiles were launched with a lofted trajectory. If
they were to have been launched with a normal trajectory,
it is estimated that they would have a maximum range of
at least 5,500 km. The images suggest that the missiles
were of two-stage configuration.
On July 4 of the same year, the day of the launch, North
Korea made an “important announcement,” announcing
that it had successfully conducted a test launch of a new
type of ICBM. Furthermore, on the day following the
July 28 launch, North Korea asserted that the “nuclear
bomb detonation device” had functioned normally, and
the safety of the warhead in an atmospheric reentry
environment had been maintained.
Based on the released images, the “Hwasong-14”type ICBM-class ballistic missiles have the following
in common with the “Hwasong-12”-type IRBM-class
ballistic missile: (1) the configuration of engine system
(one main engine and four auxiliary engines); (2) the
shape of the lower part of the propulsion system (conical
shape); and (3) the straight-line flame of liquid-propulsion
systems can be confirmed. Based on the respective
ranges that can be estimated for the missiles and other
matters, it can be assumed that Hwasong-14 type was
possibly developed on the basis of the Hwasong-12 type
IRBM-class ballistic missile.
Also, based on images published by North Korea, it
can be confirmed that the “Hwasong-14”-type missiles
had been mounted on the wheeled eight-axle TEL.
However, it can be confirmed from the images at the time
of the launches that they were launched from simplified
launch pads, not TELs.
(ii) ICBM-class “Hwasong-15”
On November 29, 2017, North Korea launched an
ICBM-class ballistic missile, referred to by North
Korea as “Hwasong-15,” with a lofted trajectory. On
the day of the launch, North Korea made a “government
statement,” declaring that it had successfully conducted
a test launch of the “Hwasong-15,” a newly developed
type of ICBM with the capability to strike all areas of
the U.S. mainland and asserting that it had completed
development of its state nuclear force.
Moreover, another “Hwasong-15” missile was
launched with a lofted trajectory on February 18, 2023.


**Part**
**Ⅰ**

**Chapter**


27 North Korea repeatedly launched the Musudan that is believed to be a ballistic missile in 2016. Although the missile launched in June of the same year flew a certain distance on a lofted trajectory,
the fact that there were two successive launch failures in October would suggest that there may still be obstacles remaining towards the operationalization of the Musudan and that North Korea
may be concentrating on the development and operationalization of the “Hwasong-12” as an IRBM instead. It is pointed out that the range of the Musudan is up to approximately 2,500-4,000 km.


-----

Then on the following day, North Korea announced that
“ICBM launch training” had been conducted and that
“the reliability of the weapon system was reconfirmed
and verified.”
“Hwasong-15” is loaded on a nine-axle TEL[28], and
from released images, two-stage configuration and its
straight-line exhausts, a typical characteristic of a liquid
fuel propelled engine can be confirmed.
Moreover, the range of “Hwasong-15” is estimated to
be over 14,000 km based on the trajectory of maximum
altitude around 5,700km and flight distance around
1,000km when it was launched in February 2023,
depending on factors such as its warhead weight. In this
case, the range would cover the whole U.S. territory
including the East Coast.
(iii) ICBM-class “Hwasong-17”
North Korea launched one ballistic missile on both
February 27 and March 5, 2022. Both are estimated
to have been launched with a lofted trajectory, flying
approximately 300 km and reaching maximum altitudes
of approximately 600 km and 550 km respectively.
North Korea announced the day after each launch that
they were “reconnaissance satellite” development tests,
but it is believed that a new type of ICBM-class ballistic
missile, referred to by North Korea as “Hwasong-17,”
was launched at that time.
The ICBM-class missile launched on March 24,
2022, recorded a lofted trajectory of maximum altitude
over around 6,000 km and flight distance over around

Image publicly released by North Korea when it launched an ICBM-class ballistic missile
“Hwasong-17” (November 2022) [Korea News Service]


1,100 km, greatly exceeding the trajectory and distance
of “Hwasong-15” launched in November 2017. North
Korea announced on the following day that it conducted
test launching of “Hwasong-17.”[29] While North Korea
repeatedly launched missiles after that, the launches on
May 4 and 25, and November 3 and 18, 2022 and March
16, 2023 are presumed to be of the ICBM-class ballistic
missile “Hwasong-17.” The range of “Hwasong-17” is
estimated to be over 15,000 km based on the past flight
trajectories depending on factors such as its warhead
weight. In this case, the range would cover the whole U.S.
territory including the East Coast. North Korea’s efforts
to extend the range of its ballistic missiles is a matter of
concern once again. Furthermore, North Korean media
later reported on the launch on November 18, 2022,
stating that the “final test launch” of “Hwasong-17” was
successfully conducted.
From released images, “Hwasong-17” is presumed
to be two-stage, and the straight-line exhausts, a typical
characteristic of a liquid fuel propelled engine can be
confirmed. The missile is mounted on an 11-axle TEL,
believed to be the largest in North Korea’s possession,
and its size is thought to exceed that of the existing
“Hwasong-15”-type. It has been suggested that North
Korea is possibly pursuing a greater yield and multiple
warheads which are generally considered difficult to
intercept, based on the increased warhead weight.[30]

(iv) ICBM-class ballistic missile Hwasong-18
On April 13 2023, North Korea launched a single
ICBM-class ballistic missile (referred to by North
Korea as Hwasong-18). This was a new type of threestage solid-fuel propelled missile, and it is estimated
that it flew approx. 1,000 km shifting its direction to left
(north). North Korea announced the day after the launch
that “the first-stage was in the standard ballistic flight,
and the second-stage and third stage were in the lofted
flight,” and “we could check the performance of highpower solid-fueled multi-stage engines and blowing off
technology of each stage.”
The launch by so-called a “cold launch system,” in
which the missile is ignited after being ejected into the

28 Although the wheel-drive TELs possessed by North Korea are thought to be modified versions of Russian and Chinese TELs, it is noteworthy that North Korea claimed to have developed its own TELs.
Furthermore, based on published images of Hwasong-15, it is confirmed that the missile was loaded on and launched from the TEL in February 2023, while it was launched after being decoupled
from the TEL in November 2017.

29 North Korea also launched a ballistic missile shortly prior on March 16, 2022, but it is presumed to have not flown properly, and other details, including the type of missile, are still being analyzed.
30 Eleven Hwasong-17s and five launchers that may be TELs for as-yet unannounced new ICBM-class missiles (later, North Korea announced the launching an ICBM-class ballistic missile they called
Hwasong-18 from a TEL that was viewed identical to this one) were shown in what was called the “ICBM column” at the military parade in February 2023. Since the number of missiles significantly
increased from the four Hwasong-17s and four Hwasong-15s shown at the previous parade (in April 2022), it is pointed out that North Korea was showing off its mass-production setup of ICBM

-----

air from a TEL assumed to be the same as the 9-axle TEL
shown for the first time in the military parade in February
2023, and radial exhausts, a typical characteristic of solid
fuel-propelled engines, can be confirmed from each of
the images that North Korea released.
It is viewed that North Korea put the top priority to
the completion of solid-fuel propelled ICBMs since
Chairman Kim set it as a goal in January 2021. It is
possible that there will be further launches for achieving
operationalization, based on the fact that the launch in
April was, allegedly, “the first test launch”.
(h) Taepodong-2
Taepodong-2 is a long-range ballistic missile launched
from a fixed launch pad.[31] It is believed that this missile
is equipped with four and one Nodong-base engines
at its first and second stage respectively. Its range is
estimated to be approximately 6,000 km for the twostage type, while the range of its three-stage variant can
be more than approximately 10,000 km assuming that
the weight of the warhead is not over approximately 1
ton. Taepodong-2 missiles and its variants have been
launched a total of five times so far.
Most recently, in February 2016, North Korea
conducted a launch of a missile disguised as a “satellite”
from the Tongch’ang-ri district in the northwest coastline
of North Korea using a Taepodong-2 variant after
notifying international organizations. It is assessed that
North Korea’s long-range ballistic missiles’ technological
reliability had been advanced by this launch because it is
estimated that (1) it successfully launched two similar
types of ballistic missiles in a row; (2) the missile flew in
almost the same way as the last launch; and (3) it put an
object into orbit around the Earth.
(i) Ballistic Missiles Referred to as “Hypersonic Missiles”
On January 5 and 11, 2022, North Korea launched
one ballistic missile each day, which it referred to as
a “hypersonic missile”. Both missiles are believed to
have flown at lower altitudes than conventional ballistic
missiles. In particular, the missile launched on January 11
may have flown at a maximum speed of approximately
Mach 10 with an irregular trajectory that included
horizontal maneuvers.[32]

Based on images released by North Korea, it is
confirmed that the missiles were launched from a
wheeled TEL and that they had a conical warhead and


were equipped with an engine appearing to be a liquidfuel propulsion system. It has been pointed out that its
conical warhead may have been based on Maneuverable
Re-entry Vehicle (MaRV)-related technology. In any
case, based on announcements to date, it is clear that
North Korea continues to pursue the development
and enhancement of hypersonic missiles and the
like in an attempt to breach other countries’ missile
defense networks. It is necessary to monitor its future
technological progress, including its application of these
technologies on longer-range missiles and moves for
the development of a possible ballistic missile with a
flat warhead (referred to as the “Hwasong-8” by North
Korea), which was launched on September 28, 2021
with the designation as “hypersonic missile.”

b Other Missile Forces under Development by
North Korea
(a) Cruise missiles
While North Korea has been supposed to develop and
retain anti-ship cruise missiles with relatively short
range including ones modified from Chinese-made
cruise missiles, in recent years it stated its intention
to develop new cruise missiles which are supposed to
load tactical nuclear weapons on them. For example,
Chairman Kim mentioned the development of “ultramodern tactical nuclear weapons including intermediaterange cruise missiles” in January, 2021. In fact, North
Korea announced that it successfully conducted a test
launch of a newly developed long-range cruise missile
in September 2021, then that a long-range cruise missile
that is believed to be of another type was launched in
January 2022. These cruise missiles were repeatedly
launched after that and announced as launches of
“strategic cruise missiles” said to be deployed in the
“tactical nuclear weapons operation unit.” It is clear
that these missiles have come to be known as “Strategic
Cruise Missile Hwasal-1” and “Strategic Cruise Missile
Hwasal-2” respectively. According to North Korea’s
statement, these cruise missiles flew up to 2,000km.
Besides, North Korea has announced to have launched
a “Strategic Cruise Missile” from a submarine in March
2023.
While many of the details, including their actual
performance, are still unknown, it is obvious that North
Korea pursues operationalization not only of ballistic
missiles but also of long-range nuclear capable cruise
missiles. If the series of the announcements about flying
distances and the like are factual, there is a need for
concern, as these missiles pose threats peace and stability
in the region.
(b) “New Type of Tactical Guided Weapon”
On April 17, 2022, North Korea announced that a “new
type of tactical guided weapon” was launched. The
missile was seen at the military parade on April 25
and also later appeared in North Korean media. It can
also be confirmed that the missile is transported on a
three-axle wheeled TEL and that radial exhausts are
a typical characteristic of solid fuel propelled engines.
This missile is believed to be one of the weapons that
North Korea is developing as potentially tactical nuclear
weapons, in aiming to respond to armed conflicts that
may occur with U.S. Forces and ROK Forces involving
conventional forces and/or tactical nuclear weapons


This belief is based on North Korea s announcements
stating that these missiles are significant in drastically
improving long-range artillery firepower and strike
capabilities on each front and enhancing “effectiveness
of tactical nuclear weapons operation.”
c Trends in Ballistic Missile Development
North Korea has driven ballistic missile development
and attempted to improve related technologies and
operational capabilities quite rapidly and in continuous
manner. These trends have the following characteristics.
(a) Improvement of missile-related technologies
(i) Improvement of concealment and promptness
North Korea appears to be seeking to improve its ability
to conduct surprise attacks by enhancing concealment and
promptness to make it difficult to detect signs of a launch.
North Korea has repeatedly launched missiles from
various platforms such as TELs, submarines and railway
cars in recent years. Using these platforms, launchers can
be concealed, and missiles could be launched from any
given site. It appears that North Korea aims to complicate
indication of warning detection and interception by
improving concealment.
In addition, particularly since 2019, North Korea has
repeatedly launched ballistic missiles using solid fuel. It is
therefore believed that North Korea is proceeding with the
development of solid-fueled ballistic missiles. Generally,
solid fuel-propelled ballistic missiles are not only
relatively easier to store and handle, but are also preloaded
with solid fuel. Therefore, in comparison to liquid fuelpropelled missiles, they can be launched promptly, and
the signs of their launch are more difficult to detect.
Furthermore, they can be reloaded more quickly. In this
respect, they are considered to be superior militarily. Such
characteristics are expected to contribute to improving the
ability to conduct surprise attacks. While in the past solid
fuel propelled ballistic missiles developed and retained by
North Korea were mainly short-range missiles, Chairman
Kim raised the development of solid fuel propelled
ICBMs as a task in January 2021, and a new-type solidfuel propelled ICBM-class ballistic missile was actually
launched on April 13 2023. Attention should be focused
on future trends.
(ii) Enhancement of penetration capabilities for Ballistic
Missile Defense (BMD)
North Korea is advancing the development of ballistic
missiles that fly at low altitudes with irregular trajectories
in an attempt to breach other countries’ missile defense
networks The SRBM A SRBM B and SRBM D as

**Chapter**


-----

well as rail-launched ballistic missiles and a new type
of SLBM with a similar outline to the SRBM A, are
believed to be capable of flying at lower altitudes than
conventional ballistic missiles with irregular trajectories.
Furthermore, North Korea raised the development
of “hypersonic gliding flight warheads” as one of its
priority targets. Actually, it has repeatedly launched
missiles it called “hypersonic missile” since September
2021. In this way, North Korea is persistently pursuing
missile development to make interception difficult and
to breach missile defense networks.
(iii) Developing long-range missiles
North Korea consistently pursues development of
SRBMs flying with irregular trajectories as well as longrange missiles with ranges covering the United States.
The ICBM-class ballistic missile Hwasong-17 is thought
to have a range of over 15,000 km depending on the
weight of its warhead, etc. In such a case, the whole U.S.
territory including the East Coast is within its range.
For the operationalization of these ballistic missiles,
it is said that technology to protect the re-entry vehicle
from the extremely high temperature generated during the
atmospheric re-entry of the warhead is required. Although
North Korea announced that the reliability of warheads in
the re-entry environment had been proven after launching
ICBM-class missiles “Hwasong-14” and “Hwasong-15”
in 2017, careful analysis is still needed to determine
whether this technology actually has been established.
On the other hand, should North Korea make further
progress in the development of long-range ballistic
missiles, it may unilaterally come to have a recognition
that it has secured a strategic deterrence against the
United States. If North Korea has such a false sense
of confidence and recognition regarding its deterrence,


it could lead to an increase and escalation of military
provocations by North Korea in the region, a situation
that Japan needs to be deeply concerned about.
(b) Enhancement of missile operation capabilities
North Korea has launched ballistic missiles in various
patterns such as multiple and simultaneous launches,
consecutive launches at very short intervals and multiple
launches from various locations at specific targets.
First, there have been some cases since 2014 in which it
launched multiple missiles from unprecedented locations,
cutting across the Korean Peninsula, in the early morning
and late at night using TELs. In recent years, North Korea
has conducted launch drills and other training combining
SRBMs with various types of artillery, showing that it has
the capability to launch multiple missiles simultaneously
at a given time and place.
Second, North Korea attempts consecutive launches
at very short intervals. For example, the SRBM C which
North Korea refers to as a “super-large multiple rocket
launcher” is thought to be developed in order to enhance
continuous fire capabilities. In fact, from 2019, there
was a case, in which two SRBM C were launched at
estimated intervals of less than one minute.
Third, there have been some cases since 2019, in which
North Korea launched multiple ballistic missiles and other
weapons from various places and hit specific targets.
Through these launches, North Korea is believed
to pursue the enhancement of not only missile-related
technologies but also practical missile operational
capabilities with saturation attack and the like in mind.

of various weapons as future military objectives at the

**North Korea’s Nuclear and Missile Development Trends in 2022**

In 2022, North Korea repeatedly launched ballistic missiles and various bilateral exercises from September to November,

At the Congress of the Korean Worker’s Party (KWP) in repeatedly launched various types of missiles, including one that

8th Congress of the KWP in January, 2021. It is said that
the “five-year plan” was presented at this time.
With regard to nuclear weapons and missiles, Chairman
Kim also mentioned development of “tactical nuclear
weapons” as further advancement of nuclear technology,
miniaturization and weight reduction of nuclear weapons
and development of tactical weapons. He also stated that
North Korea would promote the production of “supersized nuclear warheads,” improve its hit rate on targets
within a 15,000 km range and upgrade its “preemptive
and retaliatory nuclear strike capabilities.” In addition,
North Korea mentioned the promotion of research and
development of multi-warhead technology, “hypersonic
gliding flight warheads,” nuclear-powered submarines,
“underwater-launched strategic nuclear weapons” and
solid fuel-propelled ICBM, demonstrating its stance of
relentlessly pursuing increasingly complex and diverse
modes of attack. In addition, besides the nuclear and
missile capabilities, development of reconnaissance
means, including military reconnaissance satellites and
unmanned reconnaissance aerial vehicles, was also
mentioned.
In fact, since this year, North Korea has launched
missiles repeatedly as if to advance the process of the
development plan presented at the Congress.
North Korea insisted that the guided maneuverability
of “hypersonic gliding flight warheads” was demonstrated
and stated that the hypersonic missile R&D project was
“belonging to the five high priority challenges in the
strategic weapons division of the five-year plan” when
it launched a missile referred to as “hypersonic missile
Hwasong-8” in September, 2021. North Korea stated
in December 2022 that the “captive firing test of highthrust solid-fuel engine” was completed successfully and
that Chairman Kim rated this highly, saying, “another
significant problem is solved to realize the five high
priority challenges in the strategic weapons division of
the five-year plan,” and stated that he expected to “show
another new strategic weapon” in the shortest period of
time.[33] From these statements, North Korea is believed
to promote R&D of “hypersonic gliding flight warheads”


and solid fuel propelled ICBMs in particular, raising
them as priority issues of the “five-year plan.”
In addition, following the February 27 and March
5, 2022 launches of ICBM-class ballistic missiles,
allegedly “reconnaissance satellite” development tests,
North Korea publicly announced that Chairman Kim had
actually inspected a facility related to the “reconnaissance
satellites,” during which he stated that the objective of
the military reconnaissance satellites is to obtain realtime military information on South Korea, Japan and the
Pacific Ocean, that a large number of “reconnaissance
satellites” will be deployed during the period of the
“five-year plan” and that the Sohae satellite launching
station in Tongch’ang-ri district will be renovated and
expanded in order to do so. North Korea stated on the
day following the launch of the ballistic missile on
December 18, 2022 that an “important test in the final
phase” for development of “reconnaissance satellites”
was completed and that its “first military reconnaissance
satellite” would be prepared by April 2023.[34]

Furthermore, Vice Department Director of the
Central Committee of the KWP Kim Yo-jong stated in
December 2022 and February 2023, “try right now”
and “the frequency for us to use the Pacific Ocean as
our shooting range” was dependent on the action of
U.S. Forces in refuting views questioning North Korea’s
acquisition of atmospheric re-entry technologies for
ICBM-class ballistic missiles. It is pointed out that this
was suggesting the possibility for North Korea to decide
to verify whether its ICBM-class missiles can tolerate
practical use through launching them towards the Pacific
Ocean if North Korea escalates provocation in the future.
In addition, North Korea showed its stance to pursue
diversified its nuclear delivery systems through the
statement made in March and April 2023 that tests for a
weapon called an “underwater nuclear attack boat” were
conducted.
In this way, while there does not appear to be any
progress in dialogues with the United States or the ROK,
North Korea constantly focuses on the R&D of related
technologies in line with the “five-year plan,” claiming

33 Chairman Kim also stated in the 6th plenary meeting of 8th Central Committee of KWP at the end of the same month that North Korea will develop “another ICBM system” with the mission of “rapid
nuclear counterattack.”

34 North Korea subsequently announced in April 2023 that Chairman Kim said that the acquisition and operation of military reconnaissance satellites are the most important and prerequisite task and
that “the military reconnaissance satellite No.1 completed will be launched at the planned date” and “speed up final preparations,” mentioning deployments of multiple reconnaissance satellites in
the future. Then, on May 17, 2023, North Korea announced the inspection of the “military reconnaissance satellite No. 1” by Chairman Kim. On May 31, after providing advance notice of the launch
period and drop zone, North Korea pushed ahead with launching a missile from near Tongch’ang-ri on the west coast of North Korea toward the south using ballistic missile technology, but it is
presumed that no object of any kind was put into space, and the launch is considered to have been a failed attempt at launching a satellite. On the same day as this launch, North Korea announced
that it had launched the military reconnaissance satellite “Malligyong-1” mounted on the “Chollima-1,” a new type of carrier rocket, but that it had crashed into the Yellow Sea, and that North Korea

that these are “defensive” actions. It is possible that
North Korea may continue to repeatedly launch various
missiles and the like to accomplish the “five-year plan”,
as it is constantly demonstrating its stance to strengthen
nuclear and missile capabilities. It is necessary to observe
weapon development and other trends closely.

**4 Domestic Affairs**


the general secretary of the party in January 2021.
On the other hand, since 2020, cases have begun to
be seen of senior party officials providing “guidance”
during site inspections and various meetings, which
had previously been performed only by Chairman Kim,
suggesting that some authority may have been delegated
to senior officials. It is believed that Chairman Kim keeps
senior party officials tense by promoting and demoting
them in a short period of time.
Furthermore, it has also been pointed out that amid
the difficult economic and food situation, the regime is
wary of social unrest caused by the influx of information
from abroad and is further strengthening its ideological
control. This is notable from the perspective of the
stability of the regime.


**(1) Developments Related to the Kim Jong-un Regime**
In North Korea, the power base centered on Chairman
Kim is being solidified. The constitution of North
Korea stipulates that the Chairman of the State Affairs
Commission is “the supreme leader of the Democratic
People’s Republic of Korea who represents the state,”
and it is pointed out that North Korea is run under the
leadership of the KWP Chairman Kim took the office of


-----

**(2) Economic Conditions**
In the economic domain, North Korea has been facing
chronic stagnation and energy and food shortages due
to the vulnerability of its socialist planned economy
and diminishing economic cooperation with the former
Soviet Union and East European countries following
the end of the Cold War. Furthermore, it faces enhanced
independent sanctions by countries including Japan and
the United States and sanctions based on UN Security
Council resolutions adopted in response to nuclear tests
and ballistic missile launches.[35]

Furthermore, it is believed that COVID-19 infections
and natural disasters largely affected North Korea’s
economy from 2020. In particular, North Korea
demonstrated a stance to deal with COVID-19 with all its
strength, undergoing a major change from conventional
passive and closed disclosure of information, announcing
that the first infected individual was confirmed in May
2022 and that epidemic prevention project was transitioned
to a “maximum emergency epidemic prevention system.”
In addition, Chairman Kim mentioned that COVID-19
was “the greatest turmoil since our founding.” Although
North Korea declared the “victory” and eradication of
COVID-19 in August 2022, the actual situation in respect
of infections has many unclear points. It is believed
that North Korea continues to face major constraints on
economic and other activities.
Chairman Kim presented the “five-year plan for the
national economic development” based on self-reliance
and self-sufficiency in January 2021. In December 2022,
Chairman Kim presented “to build up decisive assurance
for completion of the five-year plan” as the challenge of
2023, and as such, even under difficult circumstances,
it is believed that North Korea continues to consider
rebuilding the economy in accordance with “the plan”
important. Nevertheless, as North Korea is unlikely to
carry out any structural reforms that could lead to the
destabilization of its current ruling system, it faces
various challenges in making fundamental improvements
to its current economic situation.
North Korea is presumed to be evading the UN Security
Council sanctions by conducting ship-to-ship transfers


prohibited by the UN Security Council resolutions. The
final report of the UN Security Council’s Panel of Experts
assisting the North Korea Sanctions Committee (“Final
Report of the Panel of Experts submitted pursuant to
resolution 2627 (2022)”), released in April 2023, points
out that during the January-August period in 2022, North
Korea illicitly imported a volume of petroleum products
that exceeded the annual aggregate 500,000-barrel cap
by tankers of North Korean registry.

See Fig. I-3-4-6 (Sanctions based on UN Security Council Resolutions

against North Korea)

**5 Relations with Countries and Regions**

**Ⅰ**

**Chapter**


**(1) Relations with the United States**
In June 2018 at the historic U.S.-North Korea summit
meeting, Chairman Kim presented his intention to work
towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula. However, the second U.S.-North Korea
summit meeting in February 2019 ended without any
agreement being reached between the two countries.
After that, while North Korea stated that the United States
is its “biggest enemy,” it has shown a stance that the key
to establishing a new U.S.-North Korea relationship is
withdrawal of hostile policy towards North Korea by the
United States.
In April 2021, the United States announced that it
had completed a review of its policy towards North
Korea and that it would explore diplomacy with North
Korea under a “calibrated practical approach” with the
continued goal of “complete denuclearization of the
Korean Peninsula.” Although the United States clearly
stated, in the National Security Strategy (NSS) published
in October 2022, that it will seek sustained diplomacy
with North Korea to make tangible progress towards
complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,
progress such as formal restarting of dialogue has not
been seen, and the relationship between the United
States and North Korea remains deadlocked.
Although North Korea voluntarily declared to stop
“the test launch of inter-continental ballistic rockets” in
April 2018, no progress has been seen in the U.S.-North


35 In recent years, North Korean fishing boats and Chinese fishing boats have been conducting illegal operations within Japan’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) surrounding Yamato tai, creating a
situation that threatens the safety of Japanese fishing boats operating in the EEZ. In this sea area, the Fisheries Agency and the Japan Coast Guard in cooperation crack down on illegal operations
by foreign fishing boats. See the Cabinet Office Annual Report, “The situation of the oceans and the implemented measures by the Government with regard to the oceans,” the White paper on
Fisheries and the Japan Coast Guard Report for further details of the control activities.

36 Between the beginning of 2018 and the end of March 2022, MSDF patrol aircraft and ships have observed 24 cases in which a North Korean-flagged tanker and a foreign-flagged vessel were
anchored side-by-side on the high seas. As a result of comprehensive judgment by the government, there are strong suspicions that the observed vessels were engaging in illicit ship-to-ship

Korea relationship. Then, in January 2022, Chairman
Kim ordered North Korean officials to “promptly
examine the issue of restarting all temporarily suspended
activities” based on the assessment that the “hostile policy
and military threat by the United States have reached a
danger line that cannot be overlooked anymore.” In fact,
North Korea restarted launching ICBM-class ballistic
missiles from February 2022. Chairman Kim stated
that North Korea will thoroughly prepare for long term
confrontation against the United States and also stated in
his speech in September 2022 that the aim of the United
States is “to disrupt our government anytime” and “we
can never abandon nuclear weapons” to keep the United
States in check in the long term.
North Korea could further escalate its provocation
while the deadlocked relationship between the two is
continuing. Chairman Kim stated, “we have no contents
for dialogue with the enemy, and we do not feel any
necessity.”[37] Attention will be focused on future trends.

**(2) Relations with the ROK**
The three inter-Korean summit meetings in 2018 led
to major progress in inter-Korean relations, including
an agreement on the “Panmunjom Declaration,” which
confirms, among other matters, that the two parties
agreed to completely cease all hostile acts against each
other in every domain and confirmed the common goal
of realizing a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. The summit
meetings also led to an agreement on the “Pyongyang
Joint Declaration of September 2018,” which refers to
the ending of military hostilities, and the “Agreement on
the Implementation of the Panmunjom Declaration in the
Military Domain,” which prescribes concrete measures
to ease inter-Korean military tensions. However, there
has been no progress in inter-Korean relations since the
breakdown of the U.S.-North Korea summit meeting
in 2019, and North Korea has taken a hard and soft
approach to the ROK.
Furthermore, in April 2022, after President Yoon Sukyeol, who demonstrates a strict stance against North
Korea, assumed the presidency in the ROK, Kim Yojong, Vice Department Director of the Central Committee
of the KWP, stated in her press statement that while the


ROK was not a main enemy and that the north and the
south were of the same nation who should not fight each
other, if the ROK selected a military confrontation, “our
nuclear combat forces will fulfill their duty.” Chairman
Kim also stated in his speech in July 2022 that if the
ROK conducted preemptive strikes, North Korea would
retaliate immediately and the “Yoon administration and
his armed forces will be annihilated.” North Korea’s
attitude to the ROK began to turn harsh. In particular,
in September 2022, North Korea escalated provocations
such as launching ballistic missiles in succession when
the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan called at a ROK
port and conducted joint training after that. Furthermore,
regarding a series of launches, North Korea announced
it had conducted training of “tactical nuclear weapons
operation units,” targeting hypothetically airfields in
the ROK in October. Moreover, until December, North
Korea repeatedly conducted shelling towards the area
in which military exercises are banned by the military
agreement between the south and north.
North Korea opposed the Yoon administration’s
“audacious initiative”[38] stating that if North Korea accepts
denuclearization, the ROK will provide economic and
public support to North Korea according to the progress
of denuclearization. Chairman Kim stated in December
2022 that the ROK was an “absolute and obvious
enemy” and mentioned “the importance and necessity
of mass production of tactical nuclear weapons” as well
as increasing “inventory of nuclear warheads.” Attention
needs to be focused on the trend of inter-Korean relations
amid rising tensions.

**(3) Relations with Other Countries**
(i) Relations with China
China is a vital political and economic partner for North
Korea and maintains a degree of influence on North
Korea. The “Sino–North Korean Treaty of Friendship,
Co-operation, and Mutual Assistance” signed in 1961
is still effective, and China is currently North Korea’s
biggest trade partner. In 2021, trade volume between
China and North Korea was very large, accounting for
over 90% of North Korea’s total trade (excluding trade
between North Korea and the ROK),[39] suggesting North

that at the time of this announcement, Chairman Kim stated, “we would sharply watch the instable security circumstance on the Korean peninsula and all military moves of the enemies which cannot
be overlooked and strongly take all military countermeasures if necessary”

38 Vice Department Director of the Central Committee of the KWP Kim Yo-jong published an announcement and condemned the “audacious initiative” proposed by the Yoon administration saying that
it was “the perfection of stupidity” and “the hypothesis of ‘if the north takes denuclearization measures’ is the wrong prerequisite in the first place” in August 2022.


-----

Korea s dependence on China.
In regard to the situation in North Korea and its
nuclear issue, China has stated that the issues should be
resolved through dialogue and consultations based on
the concept of a “dual-track approach” (denuclearization
of the Korean Peninsula and the transition from the
armistice mechanism to a peaceful mechanism) and the
principle of phased and synchronized actions. In recent
years, China has demonstrated a stance of defending
North Korea’s repeated provocations through exercising
its power of veto with Russia over a draft UNSC sanction
resolution proposed by the United States for North
Korea’s launching of ICBM-class ballistic missiles,
and it stated that the current worsened situation on the
Korean Peninsula was caused by the United States.
The China-North Korea summit meeting was held
five times from March 2018 to June 2019. Chairman
Kim submitted a congratulatory telegram on General
Secretary Xi Jinping’s reelection in October 2022, and
the General Secretary Xi submitted a thank you telegram


in which he stated China thought the relationship between
their countries was highly important and would make it
great in the new state of affairs changing in the world.
(ii) Relations with Russia
Concerning North Korea’s nuclear issue, Russia, along
with China, has expressed support for the denuclearization
on the Korean Peninsula and early resumption of the SixParty Talks. In October 2021, Russia submitted a draft
UN Security Council resolution on North Korea jointly
with China stating that North Korea had already taken
many denuclearization measures and that there should be
adjustment of some sanctions concerning the economy
and livelihoods, and in May 2022, Russia exercised its
veto with China against the draft sanction resolution
proposed by the United States, mentioned above.
North Korea continuously shows the stance to protect
Russia, insisting since the start of Russia’s aggression
against Ukraine in February 2022 that the cause of the
situation in Ukraine is the United States and Western
countries.

strategic alliance, emphasizing the importance on the
relations with the United States.
In addition, the ROK announced its first Indo-Pacific
strategy in November 2022, in which it expressed its
intention to contribute to building up regional order
based on universal values and rules under a vision for
freedom, peace and prosperity.

**1 General Situation**

The Yoon Suk-yeol administration established in May
2022 has stated its objective of achieving sustainable
peace on the Korean Peninsula through the complete
and verifiable denuclearization of North Korea. While
the policy of the administration is to respond strongly
to North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats, the
administration also presents an “Audacious Initiative”
under which the ROK will take comprehensive measures
in the economic, political and military fields according
to the progress of denuclearization of North Korea.
Continuous attention will need to be focused on future
inter-Korean relations.
The U.S. Forces, mainly the Army, have been stationed
in the ROK since the ceasefire of the Korean War. The
ROK has established very close security arrangements
with the United States primarily based on the U.S.-ROK
Mutual Defense Treaty. The U.S. Forces Korea have been
playing an important role in securing peace and stability
of the region such as playing a vital role in deterring
the large-scale armed conflict on the Korean Peninsula.
The Yoon administration has indicated that it intends to
develop the U S ROK alliance into a comprehensive


**2 Defense Policies and Defense Reform of**
**the ROK**

The ROK has a defensive weakness, namely, its capital
Seoul, which has a population of approximately 10
million, is situated close to the DMZ.
The ROK has set the National Defense Objective as
follows: “to protect the country from external military
threats and invasions, to support peaceful unification,
and to contribute to regional stability and world peace.”
While the words “main enemy” and phrase “the North
Korean regime and its military will remain an enemy”
had not been used in Defense White Papers under the
previous administration, the latter expression was used
again in the version of the Yoon administration.
The ROK has continued to undertake reforms of its

“Defense Innovation 4.0” based on cutting-edge science
and technology such as artificial intelligence (AI) from

three axis system” consisting of kill chain, Korea Air
and Missile Defense (KAMD) and Korea Massive
Punishment and Retaliation (KMPR) and will establish
the strategic command for joint operation of forces in the
system in 2024.
The missile guidelines agreed upon by the United
States and the ROK in 1979 had placed restrictions on the
range and warhead weights of the missiles for the ROK’s
missile development. These restrictions had been lifted
gradually, and finally the termination of the guidelines
was announced at the U.S.-ROK summit meeting in May
2021.[40]

In terms of ballistic missiles, the ROK appears to have
operationally deployed Hyunmoo-2 missiles with an
estimated range of 300-800 km. The ROK also promotes
the development of “high power” type missiles; for
example, it is said that the test launch of Hyunmoo-4
missile with a two-ton warhead and 800 km firing range
was successfully conducted in 2020, and a missile under
development that is said to be Hyunmoo-5 and equipped
with a heavier warhead was announced in October 2022.
Moreover, the ROK announced that it successfully
conducted the test launch of a submarine-launched
ballistic missile (SLBM) in 2021. By developing and
possessing these various ballistic missiles, the ROK is
believed to be planning to augment and diversify its own
conventional strike capabilities without relying on the


The ROK’s military capacity is as follows. The ground
forces consist of 19 army divisions with approximately
420,000 personnel and 2 marine divisions with
approximately 29,000 personnel; the naval forces consist
of approximately 230 vessels with a total displacement
of approximately 290,000 tons; and the air forces (Air
Force and Navy combined) consist of approximately 660
combat aircraft.
The ROK Forces has been modernizing its military
forces- not only its Army but also its Navy and Air
Force- in order to establish an omni-directional defense
posture. The Navy has been introducing submarines and
domestically built destroyers. The Air Force plans to
increase the number of F-35A fighters from the current
40 and is also promoting the introduction of domestically
built fighters.
The ROK Forces are focused on building the “Korean


-----

United States and to improve survivability.
With regard to cruise missiles, the ROK appears to
have operationally deployed the Hyunmoo-3 surface-tosurface cruise missile, which is believed to have a range
of about 500-1,500 km, and the Haeseong series ship-toship/ship-to-surface cruise missiles, which are believed
to have a maximum range of 1,000-1,500 km.
Furthermore, the ROK has been actively working
on equipment export in recent years. In particular, in
2022, the annual export resulted more than doubled
that of previous years on a contract basis, reaching
US$17.3 billion[41], including a large-scale export contract
with Poland that is striving to enhance its defense
capabilities after Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.
Considering these movements, it is believed that interest
in ROK-made equipment is growing in the international
market including in Europe. The ROK set the goal to rank
4th in export of defense industries by 2027. Attention
will be focused on future trends.
Defense spending in FY2023 (regular budget)
increased by about 4.4% from the previous fiscal year
to nearly KRW 57.0143 trillion, marking the 24th
consecutive year of increases since 2000. In addition,
according to its 2023-2027 Defense Mid-term Plan, the
ROK will increase its defense budget by 6.8% on an
annual average over five years to 2027.

**4 U.S.-ROK Alliance and U.S. Forces Korea**


At the 46th SCM in 2014, the two countries
agreed on “Concepts and Principles of the ROK-U.S.
Alliance Comprehensive Counter-missile Operations
(4D Operational Concept)” to tackle North Korean
ballistic missile threats. At the 47th SCM in 2015, the
implementation guidance on the 4D Operational Concept
was approved.
Additionally, after North Korea went ahead with a
nuclear test in January 2016, the Terminal High Altitude
Area Defense (THAAD)[42] was temporarily deployed by
the U.S. Forces Korea in September 2017.
Recently, at the 53rd SCM in 2021, the United States
and the ROK expanded their alliance from the Korean
Peninsula and Northeast Asia to the Indo-Pacific
region, approved new Strategic Planning Guidance
(SPG) for the first time in 11 years and updated their
operation plans based on the SPG.[43] Moreover, at
the 54th SCM, the first for the Yoon administration,
in November 2022, both countries agreed to several
measures to enhance extended deterrence such as
revising the Tailored Deterrence Strategy (TDS) by the
next SCM, strengthening deployment of U.S. strategic
assets around the Korean Peninsula[44] and regularly
conducting tabletop exercises including a North Korea
nuclear use scenario. The ROK stated in the Washington
Declaration of the U.S.-ROK summit meeting[45] in April
2023 that the country recognized the importance to
trust the U.S. commitment for extended deterrence and
reaffirmed ROK’s commitment to its obligations under
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
(NPT). The United States and ROK also announced
in the Declaration the establishment of the Nuclear
Consultative Group (NCG) as well as a visit by a U.S.
SSBN and others as initiatives to strengthen extended
deterrence.
While the United States and the ROK had aborted or
reduced the scale of U.S.-ROK joint military exercises
from 2018, considering the progress of dialogue with
North Korea, both countries have been expanding
the scope and scale of the exercises since the Yoon
administration was established. The regular joint

The United States and the ROK have taken various steps
to deepen the U.S.-ROK Alliance in recent years. The
two countries regularly confirm the strengthening of the
U.S.-ROK Alliance at the summit level.
As specific undertakings, the two countries signed the
U.S.-ROK Counter-Provocation Plan for dealing with
North Korea’s provocations in March 2013. They also
approved the Tailored Deterrence Strategy, designed to
enhance deterrence against North Korean nuclear and
other WMD threats, at the 45th Security Consultative
Meeting (SCM) in October of the same year.


41 Major examples of export contract cases in 2022 are an approximately US$12.4 billion contract of tanks, self-propelled artillery guns, light attack jets and multiple-launch rocket systems for Poland,
a contract of intercept missiles for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and a contract of self-propelled artillery guns for Egypt and other countries.

42 A ballistic missile defense system designed to intercept short- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles in their terminal phase from the ground. It captures and intercepts targets at high altitudes
outside of the atmosphere or in the upper atmosphere.

43 The United States and ROK stated that this reflected changes to the strategic environment, including the North Korean threat. It has been pointed out that the background includes factors such as
the increasing sophistication of North Korea’s nuclear and missile capabilities.

44 The ROK stated that it will increase the frequency and intensity of deployment of U.S. strategic assets to a level equivalent to permanent deployment.

military exercises has been changed to the form that the
Freedom Shield (FS) exercise is conducted in first half
of a year and the Ulchi Freedom Shield (UFS) exercise
is in the latter half. In the UFS exercise from August
to September 2022, a large-scale field exercise was
conducted in parallel with command post exercises for
the first time in four years. After that, the joint maritime
exercise with aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan and
joint air training exercise Vigilant Storm with U.S. B-1B
bombers were conducted in 2022.[46] In addition, largescale joint field training Warrior Shield was conducted
with U.S. bombers, aircraft carrier and amphibious
assault ship deployed from March to April 2023.
At the same time, the two countries deal with such
issues as the transition of operational control (OPCON)
to the ROK[47] and the realignment of U.S. Forces Korea.
For the transition of OPCON to the ROK, aiming to
complete the transition by December 1, 2015, the two
countries have reviewed the approach of transitioning
from the existing combined defense arrangement of the
United States and ROK Forces, to a new joint defense
arrangement led by the ROK Forces and supported by
the U.S. Forces.
Nevertheless, based on the increasing seriousness
of North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats, the two
sides decided at the 46th SCM in 2014 to re-postpone
the transition of OPCON and to adopt a conditionsbased approach, i.e., implementing the transition
when conditions such as the ROK Forces’ enhanced
capabilities are met. At the 50th SCM in October 2018,
it was decided that following the transition of OPCON,
a ROK military officer will serve as the commander of
the Future Combined Forces Command, replacing the
current arrangement of a U.S. military officer serving as
the commander of the U.S.-ROK Combined Forces.
Initial Operational Capability (IOC) verification
is conducted as the first step to evaluate ROK Forces’
capability in combined command post exercise in August
2019, and the important role of the exercise to verify
IOC was confirmed. Furthermore, Full Operational
Capability (FOC) evaluation was conducted as the
second step in the UFS exercise in 2022, and at the
54th SCM in November 2022, it was confirmed that the


FOC evaluation was successfully conducted and that all
assessment task met the criteria.[48]

ROK Forces stated that the United States and the
ROK comprehensively consider the results of combined
evaluation about ROK Forces’ military capabilities
of leading U.S.-ROK combined defense and ability to
respond to North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats,
which are necessary for the transition of OPCON, then
steadily promote evaluation of the Future Combined
Forces Command according to procedures for each of
the steps.
With regard to the realignment of the U.S. Forces
Korea, an agreement had been reached in 2003 on
the relocation of the U.S. Forces’ Yongsan Garrison
located in the center of Seoul to the Pyeontaek area,
south of Seoul and on the relocation of the U.S. Forces
stationed north of the Han River to the south of the river.
Subsequently, however, the agreement has been partially
revised, due to various factors, including: in relation to
the postponement of the transition of OPCON, it has
been necessary for some U.S. Forces personnel to remain
at Yongsan Garrison; and it was decided that the counterfires forces of U.S. Forces Korea would remain in their
location north of the Han River to counter the threat of
North Korea’s long-range rocket artillery.
In July 2017, the U.S. Eighth Army headquarters
relocated to the Pyeontaek area; in June 2018 the
headquarters of U.S. Forces Korea and UN Command,
and in November 2022, the U.S.-ROK Combined Forces
Command Headquarters also relocated to the same area.
The realignment of U.S. Forces Korea could have a
significant impact on U.S. and ROK defense postures on
the Korean Peninsula, and as such it will be necessary to
follow closely in the future.
Concerning defense burden sharing, whereby the ROK
government bears a portion of the total stationing costs
of the U.S. Forces Korea to ensure a stable stationing
environment, in March 2021, the United States and
the ROK reached an agreement on the 11th Special
Measures Agreement (SMA). This agreement is valid for
six years from 2020 to 2025. Total amount for FY2020
remains unchanged at the FY2019 level and 13.9%
increase for FY 2021, compared to FY2020, while for

46 Other than this, combined air training was conducted with B-52H bombers and F-22 fighter jets deployed around the Korean Peninsula in December 2022.
47 The United States and ROK have had the U.S.-ROK Combined Forces Command since 1978 in order to operate the U.S.-ROK combined defense system to deter wars on the Korean Peninsula and
to perform effective combined operations in the case of a contingency. Under the U.S.-ROK combined defense system, OPCON over the ROK Forces is to be exercised by the Chairman of the Korea
Joint Chiefs of Staff in peacetime and by the Commander of the U.S. Forces Korea, who concurrently serves as the Commander of the Combined Forces Command, in a contingency.

**(2) Relations with Russia**
The ROK and Russia have agreed on cooperation in
the areas of military technology, defense industry, and
military supplies. Both countries held Defense Strategy
Dialogue in August 2018 and agreed to promote the
dialogue to vice minister level and, in November 2021,
also agreed to set up hotlines between Navies and
between Air Forces.
The ROK has implemented sanctions against Russia
and provided military supplies and other resources to
Ukraine in a show of solidarity with the international
community following Russia’s aggression against
Ukraine since February 2022. Although ROK still
maintains a cautious attitude to deliver military
equipment to Ukraine, President Yoon suggests possible
support outside the scope of humanitarian and economic
ones when Ukraine civilians receive attacks in a large
scale. An attention will be focused on what measures
ROK will take based on the situation in Ukraine and
considering the relationship with Russia.

spending from the previous year will be applied.

**(1) Relations with China**

China and the ROK have made continuous efforts to
strengthen their relations. China opposes the deployment
of the THAAD to U.S. Forces Korea, saying that it
undermines the strategic security interests of China.
Although both countries agreed in October 2017 to
continue communicating on the THAAD-related issues
that China was concerned about through channels
established between their respective military authorities,
conflicting views still remain.[49] The Yoon administration
raises the realization of China-ROK relations based on
“mutual respect” as a goal. Attention will be focused on
future trends in China-ROK relations.

In addition, the doctrine expresses growing alarm,
defining the following as new military risks: NATO’s
military buildup; the realization of the U.S. Global Strike
concept; the rise of global extremism (terrorism); the
formation of governments in neighboring countries that
carry out policies threatening Russia’s interests; and the
incitement of ethnic, social, and religious confrontations
in Russia.
In addition, the doctrine raises characteristics of
modern military warfare as being the massive use of
precision weapons, hypersonic weapons, electronic
warfare equipment, all types of autonomous vehicles,
and the like, as well as the phenomena of automation
and centralization of operations through a network of
automatic management systems. In addition, without
using the phrase “hybrid warfare,” the doctrine also
points out the integrated use of military force and
political, economic, informational and other non-military
measures, as well as participation in hostilities by
irregular armed groups and private military companies.
The doctrine positions nuclear weapons as an essential
component for preventing the outbreak of nuclear wars
and military conflicts that use conventional weapons.
Regarding the criteria for its use, it states Russia reserves
the right to use nuclear weapons in retaliation not only
for the use of nuclear or other WMDs, but also in the
event of invasion using conventional weapons, where
the survival of the country itself is imperiled.
In June 2020, for the first time, Russia released a
policy document, “Basic Principles of State Policy of
the Russian Federation on Nuclear Deterrence,” which is
equivalent to the so-called nuclear doctrine. Criteria for
the use of nuclear weapons are the same as the criteria
described in the military doctrine, but the document
clarifies the conditions for Russia to newly proceed to
the use of nuclear weapons. In the “Basic Principles,”
it is explained that, in addition to the “individual states

[...] that consider the Russian Federation as a potential
adversary,” “military coalitions (blocs, alliances)” in
which these countries participate are also subject to
Russia’s “red lines” for nuclear deterrence.

and reached 4.4% of GDP. After that, it has generally
remained at a level of around 3% of GDP. Furthermore,

the original budget for FY2023 increased 6.5% from the
previous year due to the aggression against Ukraine.[1]

See Fig. I-3-5-1 (Changes in Russia’s Defense Expenditure)

**3 Military Reform**


Russia has implemented full-scale military reform
since 1997 by presenting the three pillars of reform:
downsizing; modernization; and professionalization.
Regarding the downsizing of military forces, troop
reductions and systems reorganization (with services
and military districts consolidated, and fundamental
organizational units of land forces transferred from
divisions to brigades) have been progressed. As a result,
by January 2021, joint strategic commands were placed
instead of four military districts (Western, Southern,


-----

Central and Eastern Districts) as well as the Northern
Fleet (in charge of units facing the Arctic) respectively.
The entire military forces such as Land Forces, Navy,
and Aerospace Forces units are jointly operated under
each District Commander in this system.
However, since the commencement of the aggression
against Ukraine in February 2022, the Russian Ministry
of Defence and the AFRF show some movements to
increase strength as well as to enlarge and reorganize
units. Defence Minister Shoigu proposed to increase
total strength to 1.5 million troops, establish two military
districts in Moscow and Leningrad, reorganize several
existing brigades into divisions, strengthen artillery
units, newly deploy one corps to the Finland border
region, and other measures to President Putin at the
Ministry of Defence staff conference expanded meeting
in December 2022.
Regarding the modernization of the military forces, the
AFRF has achieved its goal of increasing its percentage
of new equipment to 70% by 2020. It was announced
that the percentage reached 71% (as of the end of 2021)


for conventional forces and 91% (as of the end of 2022)
for strategic nuclear forces.
Regarding the professionalization of the military
forces, in order to make the combat readiness of the
permanent readiness units effective, Russia promotes
the introduction of a contract service system which
selects personnel who would serve under contracts
from the conscripted military personnel. The number
of contracted soldiers exceeded that of draftees in 2015
for the first time, and the number of contracted soldiers
is said to have grown to about double the number of
draftees in 2020.
The partial mobilization of reservists started from
September 2022, because of a shortage of strength
from the heavy loss of soldiers as well as low morale
and skills of Russian troops noticeable in the aggression
against Ukraine. Furthermore, volunteers are recruited
in companies related to government and prisons. It is
pointed out that some of these draftees and volunteers
are brought to the frontline without sufficient equipment
and skills.

**Military Posture and Trends**

**1 Nuclear and Missile Forces**


**Part**
**Ⅰ**

**Chapter**


Russia’s military forces are comprised of forces such
as the AFRF, the Border Guard Service of the Federal
Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), and
the Federal National Guard Service of the Russian
Federation. The AFRF consists of three services and
two independent forces: Land Forces; Navy; Aerospace
Forces; Strategic Missile Forces; and Airborne Forces.
In developing its military capabilities, after having been
conscious of the United States, which it has confronted
in the past, and ensured a balance in its nuclear forces,
Russia is expanding equipment similar to that of advanced
nations, such as land-attack cruise missiles capable of
being precision-guided and unmanned vehicles, for its
conventional forces that it perceives as inferior to those
of advanced nations. As for its asymmetric responses, it
is believed that Russia places importance on improving
its so-called “A2/AD” capabilities through long-range
surface-to-air and surface-to-ship missile systems and
electronic warfare equipment.

See Fig. I-3-5-2 (Location and Strength of Russian Military (image))


Russia emphasizes its nuclear forces to secure its global
position, to strike a balance with the nuclear forces of
the United States and to supplement its inferiority in
conventional forces. Russia is thus making efforts to
maintain readiness, and is renewing various platforms,
early-warning systems, and other equipment.
Regarding strategic nuclear forces, Russia possesses
intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarinelaunched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and long-range
bombers comparable to the United States in scale.
In 2011, Russia started the deployment of ICBM
Yars, which is considered a multi-warhead version of
ICBM Topol-M. It says it is currently testing the large

there are plans to deploy five of such vessels each to the
Northern Fleet and Pacific Fleet in the future. Russia also

Tu-95s and the new production of Tu-160 long-range
bombers.
As for non-strategic nuclear forces, Russia is working
to deploy various non-strategic missiles such as the
ground-launched missile system “Iskander,” which is
believed to be capable of carrying either conventional or
non-strategic nuclear warheads, the sea-launched cruise
missile system “Kalibr,” the air-launched cruise missile
Kh-101, and the air-launched ballistic missile “Kinzhal.”
Russia places these missiles as “non-nuclear deterrence
by precise guided weapons,” and considers them
important. In particular, Russia has been promoting the
deployment of warships capable of carrying the “Kalibr”
submarine-launched cruise missile (SLCM) system in
the Far East. It is necessary to closely watch this trend


because it could have a major impact on the security
environment around Japan.

**2 New Types of Weapons**


Russia has opposed ongoing missile defense system
build ups by the United States domestically and abroad
in recent years.
Russia announces that it develops the following
various advanced weapons in order to penetrate missile
defense systems deployed in the United States and other
countries, that can be countermeasures for Russian
ballistic missiles which are the foundations of Russia’s
nuclear forces.
-  Hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) **“Avangard,” which**
is claimed to be capable of flying at speeds greater
than Mach 20 in the intercontinental atmosphere
-  Sea-launched hypersonic cruise missile (HCM)

**“Zircon,” which has a believed range of 1,500 km with**
the maximum speed of Mach 9
-  Nuclear cruise missile “Burevestnik,” which is
capable of flying at lower altitudes with no substantial
range limitation
-  Nuclear-powered unmanned underwater drone
weapon “Poseidon,” which is claimed to be able to
navigate at high-speed in the deep sea
Of these new weapons, HGV “Avangard” is deployed
already, and HCM “Zircon” is believed to be deployed
because Russia announced in January 2023 that the
Gorshkov-class missile frigate RFS Admiral Gorshkov,
equipped with HCM “Zircon,” is going to be deployed to
the high seas as a part of the Northern Fleet.
Regarding Russia’s own missile defense equipment,

being completed, the Navy will now move on to building
surface vessels for the open sea.

**4 Space and Electromagnetic Domain**


The AFRF has also been stepping up its activities in
the realms of space and electromagnetic spectrum in
recent years. Russia is believed to be promoting the
development of anti-satellite weapons such as the
“Nudol” anti-satellite missile system. In November
2021, Russia announced that it would conduct a satellite
destruction test using an anti-satellite missile. Since 2013,
Russia has put satellites into both low and geostationary
orbits to conduct rendezvous and proximity operations
(RPO), which have repeatedly been observed engaging
in frequent RPO with other countries’ satellites on
geostationary orbits.
In the electromagnetic spectrum domain, since 2009,
the AFRF has established an Electronic Warfare (EW)
Unit, and many new EW systems have been procured
and distributed or allocated to each service and force.
In December 2021, it was announced that the EW Unit
belonging to the Central Military District conducted an
exercise to deceive the enemy by sending fake orders
and signals to conceal the activities of their own forces.
This indicates that the AFRF places importance on
improving electronic warfare capabilities as a response
to “network-centric warfare.”

of 2022, and it was announced that test launches of an
advanced ballistic missile intercept missile system were
conducted in November 2022.

**3 Conventional Forces and Other Issues**


Russia has conducted research and development for
equipment based on its State Armament Program (GPV).
However, it is pointed out that several factors, such as the
need to cover the loss of equipment from the aggression
against Ukraine, and very low availability of machine
tools and various parts due to economic sanctions, are
hindering the continuation of the GPV.
Land Forces continue tests for advanced equipment
such as T-14 tanks and Koalitsiya-SV self-propelled 155
mm howitzers.
The Aerospace Force announced that deployment
of the pre-production model of the so-called “fifthgeneration fighter” Su-57 was started, and that it is
putting effort into integration of unmanned aircraft and
manned aircraft for UAV development.
The Russian Navy plans to increase the rate of
modernization of its equipment to 70% by 2027. Because
the development of surface vessels for coastal waters is


Since 2010, the AFRF has been conducting large-scale
round-robin exercises in each military district, with the
objective of verifying the combat readiness of the military
districts, etc.[2] These exercises are helping to improve the
long-distance mobilization capability of the AFRF. In
2022, the strategic command and staff exercise Vostok
2022 was conducted in the Eastern Military District with
over 50,000 troops, and 14 countries including China
and India participated.
Among exercises for nuclear and missile forces, in
February 2022, just prior to the start of the aggression
against Ukraine, a large-scale missile exercise was


The exercises were conducted primarily in the Eastern, Central, Southern, and Western Military Districts, and are called “Vostok (East),” “Tsentr (Central),” “Kavkaz (Caucasus),” and “Zapad (West)”

activities as strategic nuclear deterrence patrols by
SSBN and patrol flights by long-range bombers. For
example, Tu-95 and Tu-160 long-range bombers have
frequently been observed flying through international
airspace off the Alaskan coast and over the Barents Sea
and Norwegian Sea.
Against the background of such activities in the
Arctic Region, this region had been attracting attention
from many countries due to increased mining potential
of reserve resources and enhanced usefulness as a sea
route identified with sea ice melting caused by global
warming in recent years. For this reason, Russia has been
promoting the system to defend the national interests in
the Arctic Region, and clearly stating in various policy
documents the interests in the Arctic Region and the
roles of the AFRF in defending them. For example, in
the Strategy for Developing the Russian Arctic Zone
and Ensuring National Security until 2035, revised in
October 2020, Russia clearly states “ensuring operational
system adequate for the Arctic Circle,” “developing
modern weapons, and military and special equipment
suitable for the Arctic environment,” and “developing
base infrastructure” as specific issues to be addressed in
order to ensure the military security in the Arctic Region.
Russia thus appears to be stepping up military
activities, so close scrutiny of developments in this
regard will be required.

conducted across Russia as a “strategic deterrence forces
exercise” using strategic nuclear forces such as ICBMs
and SLBMs as well as missile forces capable of carrying
conventional or tactical nuclear warheads (Iskander,
Kalibr, Kinzhal, and Zircon). In addition, a similar missile
exercise for strategic nuclear forces also was conducted
as “strategic deterrence training” in October 2022.
In the Arctic Region, Russia is developing coastal
surveillance radar networks for enhanced vigilance and
surveillance. At the same time, Russia is rebuilding
airfields and deploying Tu-22M medium-range bombers
and MiG-31 interceptor fighters, while also deploying
surface-to-air missiles and surface-to-ship missiles to
develop sufficient preparedness for dealing with airborne
threats from the north and attacks from ships. Along
with these developments, Russia has built a large-scale
residential facility for personnel at the base in two places
within the Arctic Region.
In addition to the development of such military
facilities the AFRF has also been conducting such

District Commander, who conducts unified operation of
these services.
The current presence of the AFRF in the Far East
region is significantly smaller than it was at its peak.
However, a considerable scale of military forces,
including nuclear forces, still remains in the region.
Russian armed forces in the vicinity of Japan are
generally increasing activity, including the trend related
to the deployment of new units and military facility.
In recent years, Russia has also been deploying the
latest equipment in the Far East. It announced that the
percentage of new equipment in the Eastern Military
District was 56% as of December 2021.
Given that the AFRF set their basis of operation
on maintaining the combat readiness of their strategic
nuclear units and dealing with conflicts through the
intertheater mobility of its round-the-clock readiness
units, it is necessary to keep our attention on the trends
of the AFRF in the Far East region while also keeping in
mind the trends of units in other regions.

**(1) Nuclear Forces**
As for strategic nuclear forces in the Far East region, three
Borey-class SSBNs equipped with SLBMs are deployed
in and around the Sea of Okhotsk, and approximately
30 Tu-95 long-range bombers are deployed in Ukrainka.
Russia is prioritizing the reinforcement of its maritime
strategic deterrence posture which had been scaled down
after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and as part of these
efforts, it plans on deploying five Borey-class SSBNs to
the Pacific Fleet in the future.


The fleet is comprised of approximately 250 ships with
a total displacement in the region of approximately
670,000 tons, including approximately 20 major surface
ships and approximately 15 submarines (approximately
10 of which are nuclear powered submarines). Warships
equipped with cruise missile Kalibr have also been
deployed sequentially to the Pacific Fleet since 2021. As
of the end of FY2022, such warships as one Udaloy-class
destroyer (modified type) and four improved Kilo-class
submarines in Vladivostok, as well as one Steregushchiy
**II-class frigate and one Yasen-class nuclear-powered**
attack submarine in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy are
deployed.

**(4) Air Forces**
In the Eastern Military District, Russia deploys
approximately 320 combat aircraft from its Aerospace
Forces and Navy combined. Existing models are being
modernized and new models, such as the Su-35 fighters
and the Su-34 fighter-bombers, are being introduced to
improve their capabilities.

**(5) Operations in the Vicinity of Japan**
In the vicinity of Japan, the AFRF has been generally
increasing its activities, including exercises and drills
which are believed to be conducted for objectives such
as verifying the results of the military reform.
The number of exercises carried out by the Russian
Land Forces in the areas adjacent to Japan has decreased
from the peak. However, its activities are generally
increasing.
With regard to naval vessels, their activities are
generally increasing in recent years. For example,
various exercises and long-distance voyages have been
carried out by Pacific Fleet vessels, along with patrols by
nuclear-powered submarines.
From the end of January to mid-March 2022, a largescale naval exercise, believed to be a part of the Russian
Navy’s whole fleet exercise, was conducted in the Sea
of Okhotsk and other areas with the participation of
more than 20 naval vessels. During the exercise period,
a total of 49 vessels, including those not announced as
participating in the exercise, sailed through the Soya and
Tsugaru Straits. The exercise was unique in terms of both
its timing and scale. In addition, given the characteristics
of the sea area in which the exercise was conducted, it
is believed that it was intended to demonstrate Russia’s
ability to actively operate in the Sea of Okhotsk which


**(2) Ground Forces**
The Eastern Military District now consists of 31 brigades
and two divisions with approximately 80,000 personnel
in total, including motorized rifles (mechanized infantry),
tanks, artillery, surface-to-surface missiles, material
and technology security (logistics), and air defense, as
well as a marine brigade equipped with amphibious
operations capability. The Eastern Military District
has introduced new equipment, such as the “Iskander”
surface-to-surface missile system, “Bal” and “Bastion”
surface-to-ship missiles, and the “S-400” surface-to-air
missile system.

**Russian Forces in Japan’s Northern Territories**
**4**


Since 1978 during the former Soviet Union era, Russia
has redeployed Land Forces units on Kunashiri, Etorofu,
and Shikotan Islands of the Northern Territories, which
are inherent territories of Japan.
While the Russian troop strength is thought to be far
less than that at peak times, one division, which belongs
to a corps still stationed in South Sakhalin, is located
on Kunashiri and Etorofu Islands. Furthermore, tanks,
armored vehicles, various types of artillery, anti-air
missiles, and unmanned reconnaissance vehicles are
deployed.
Furthermore in recent years Russia has been


upgrading the facilities of its troops located in the Northern
Territories. It is also deploying new equipment such as
coastal (surface-to-ship) missiles belonging to its Navy
and fighter aircraft belonging to its Aerospace Forces,
conducting large-scale exercises, and implementing
other such activities as it increases its military activities
under the illegal occupation of the Northern Territories,
which are inherent territories of Japan.
Some point out the background for such moves as
being the rising military importance of all of the Sea
of Okhotsk, an operating area of SSBN, as well as the
trend of increasing Russian military activities not only in

the Northern Territories but also in South Sakhalin and
the Chishima Islands, whose jurisdiction has not been
determined.
In recent years, the deployment of major new
equipment in the Northern Territories has included the
announced deployment of coastal (surface-to-ship)
missiles to Etorofu and Kunashiri Islands in 2016, and
in August 2018, three Su-35 fighters were reportedly
deployed at the new civilian airport on Etorofu Island,
which was opened to military and civilian dual use in
January of that year.
As for equipment of the Land Forces, in December
2020, media related to the Russian Ministry of Defence
reported the deployment of **“S-300V4”** surface-to-air
missile (maximum firing range of 400 km) in Etorofu
and Kunashiri Islands. Furthermore, in January 2022,
it was announced that in the previous year, the tanks
of the units located in the Northern Territories had
been replaced with the “T-80BV,” which is suitable for
operation in cold regions.

Military exercises have also continued in the Northern
Territories. In June 2021, landing and anti-landing
exercises were conducted on Etorofu Island, Kunashiri
Island, and South Sakhalin, involving over 10,000
military personnel, 500 ground equipment and machines,
32 aircraft, and 12 vessels.
In addition, in the vicinity of Sakhalin and the
Chishima Islands, which, like the Northern Territories,
are adjacent to the Sea of Okhotsk, it is reported that the
AFRF newly deployed the S-400 surface-to-air missile
system to South Sakhalin in February 2021, the surfaceto-ship missile system Bastion to South Sakhalin at the
end of 2021, to Matua (Matsuwa) Island of the Chishima
Islands in December 2021, and to Paramushir Island
of the Chishima Islands in December 2022. There are
reports on the establishment of a new coastal (surfaceto-ship) missile brigade placed in South Sakhalin, with
jurisdiction over units located on Etorofu and Kunashiri
Islands. It is necessary to monitor with strong concern the
Russian military movements in the Far East, including
the Northern Territories, while taking into account
developments in the aggression against Ukraine.

Russia has exported military equipment such as surfaceto-air missiles, fighter jets, and submarines to China
since the 1990s until recent years. Russia also continues
to advance close military cooperation even during the
aggression against Ukraine, and Russia and China
conduct various joint military actions.
In May and November 2022, the “China-Russia
joint air patrol,” which has been conducted annually
since 2019 by Russian Tu-95 bombers and Chinese H-6
bombers, was conducted in the airspace from the Sea of
Japan through the East China Sea to the Pacific Ocean.
In September 2022, warships of Russia and China
conducted joint training as a part of Russia Eastern
Military District strategic command and staff exercise
Vostok 2022. After the exercise, warships of both
navies, consisting mainly of vessels that participated in
the exercise, conducted the China-Russia Joint Naval
Patrol for the second time since October 2021, in the
sea area around Japan. These joint military actions
frequently conducted by Russia and China are intended

Russia positions the development of bilateral and
multilateral cooperation with former Soviet republics
as one of its most important foreign policy objectives.
Russia considers that its vital interests are concentrated
in the region. It deploys its troops in the Collective
Security Treaty Organization (CSTO)[3] members
Armenia, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan, as well as Moldova
(Transnistria), Georgia (South Ossetia, Abkhazia),
and Ukraine (Crimea). Through the conclusion of an
alliance and strategic partnership treaty with Abkhazia
in November 2014, the conclusion of an alliance and
integration treaty with South Ossetia in 2015, and other
efforts, Russia has been working to ensure its military
influence.
However, today, after more than thirty years have
passed since the collapse of USSR, none of the former
Soviet Union countries except Belarus support Russia’s
aggression against Ukraine. It is also pointed out
that former Soviet countries are opposed to Russia’s
recruitment of their citizens, and some consider that
Russia’s influence on the former Soviet area will decline
still further in the wake of the aggression against Ukraine.
Russia strengthens military cooperation with Belarus
along with the start of the aggression against Ukraine.
Belarusian President Lukashenko asked President Putin
to modernize his country’s aircrafts to allow them to carry
nuclear weapons in June 2022, and President Putin agreed.
It was announced in February 2023 that Belarusian forces
deployed surface-to-surface missile system Iskander

announced that Russia would complete the construction
of a special storage facility for tactical nuclear weapons
in Belarus by July 2023, while mentioning the nuclear

**(2) Relations with European Countries**
Through the framework of the NATO-Russia Council
(NRC), Russia has worked with NATO as an equal
partner in the areas of common interest, such as by
participating in certain decision-making processes.
However, following the Ukrainian crisis in 2014,
NATO and European countries suspended their practical
cooperation with Russia thereafter, including that in the
military domain, except for the NRC’s ambassador-level
meetings. Moreover, with the aggression against Ukraine,
the relationship between Russia and European countries
is the tensest it has been since the Cold War era.

**(1) Relations with Asian Countries**
Russia recognizes that the significance of the AsiaPacific region is increasing within its multi-pronged
foreign policy, and considers it strategically important
to strengthen its status in the region from the viewpoint
of socioeconomic development in Siberia and the Far
East, and security. In Asia, in addition to its relations
with China, Russia assigns an important role to its
Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership with India.
In December 2021, in conjunction with the annual
summit meeting, the inaugural 2+2 Dialogue of the
Foreign and Defence Ministers was held in New Delhi.
As for military arrangements, another example of the
ongoing wide-ranging military cooperation between
Russia and India is the joint exercise “INDRA,” which
has been taking place since 2003 with the involvement
of the armies and navies of both countries, with their air
forces also taking part in the recent years Furthermore

stated definitely.
Above all, for Syria, the AFRF has continued to
secure the Tartus Naval Base and Khmeimim Air Base
in Syria since September 2015 to conduct operations to
support the Assad administration. In operations in Syria,
Russia has conducted bombings using fighter bombers
and long range bombers, as well as attacks using cruise
missiles from surface ships and submarines deployed in
the Caspian Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. It has been
pointed out that Russia maintains a military presence in
Syria and is building permanent “A2/AD” capabilities by
deploying long-range surface-to-air missiles, as well as
expanding cooperation with neighboring countries such as
Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. Taking this into account,
Russian influence over the eastern Mediterranean region,
especially Syria, cannot be ignored.
Russia is increasing its influence over both the Syrian
situation and peace in Libya, while at the same time
coordinating its interests with Turkey. In May 2020, the
United States Africa Command (AFRICOM) announced
that Russian MiG-29 fighters were delivered to Libya
after military aircraft insignia had been removed in Syria,
and accused of Russia’s involvement in creating the
war situation in Libya using private military companies
(PMC) that the Russian government supports. It is also
reported that approximately 2,000 personnel from the
Russian PMC Wagner Group are operating in Libya.
In December 2020, the Russian government
announced an agreement with the government of
Sudan to set up a naval base on the Red Sea in Sudan,
northeastern Africa. If a base of the Russia Navy were to
be established in Sudan in the future, it is believed that


deployment capabilities of the AFRF would be improved
in the direction of the Indian Ocean.
In January 2022, the Malian military spokesman
stated that Russian instructors had been dispatched to
the country under a bilateral agreement to train Mali’s
military, and it is noted that 300 to 400 personnel of the
Russian PMC Wagner Group have been operating inside
Mali.
In February 2023, warships of the Russian Navy
Northern Fleet including an Admiral Gorshkov-class
frigate conducted a joint naval exercise with navies of
China and South Africa in the Indian Ocean east of South
Africa, for the second time since 2019.

**6 Arms Exports**


**Part**
**Ⅰ**

**Chapter**


Russia actively promotes the export of arms not only to
maintain the defense industrial base and to make economic
profit, but also to help promote better foreign policy. Export
control is exclusively conducted by the Rosoboronexport
State Corporation. Currently, Russia has the third largest
share of arms exports in the world after the United States
and France,[4] exporting fighters, vessels and surface-to-air
missiles to regions including Asia, Africa, and the Middle
East. In recent years, Russia has actively tried to sell not
only to conventional importers of its products but also to
U.S. allies and U.S. friendly countries such as Turkey.
However, the U.S. Countering America’s Adversaries
Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) passed in 2017, and
sanctions against Russia from Russia’s aggression against
Ukraine are seen to be having a severe impact on Russia’s
defense industry.

In addition, Australia has announced its intention to
advance cooperation with the United States on the
introduction of Tomahawk cruise missiles and standoff
missiles (JASSM-ER and LRASM), as well as on the
development of hypersonic missiles for the Royal
Australian Air Force (RAAF).

would conduct the Defence Strategic Review in order to
implement this policy and optimize the ADF.
The leaders of Australia, the U.K. and the U.S. met
in San Diego, California in March 2023 to announce
that they will deliver conventionally-armed, nuclearpowered submarines for Australia through three-phase
approach, while meeting the commitment to nuclear
non-proliferation. In the first phase, the U.K. and the
U.S. plan to establish a rotational presence of their
nuclear attack submarines (SSN) from as early as 2027
at HMAS Stirling, Western Australia. Opportunities for
Australian sailors on-board the nuclear submarines will
build practical experience for Australian crews. In the
second phase, Australia intends to acquire up to five U.S.
Virginia class SSNs in the early 2030s. In the third phase,
AUKUS partners will deliver a trilaterally-developed
submarine for both Australia and the U.K. based on the
U.K.’s next-generation design that incorporates cutting
edge U.S. submarine technologies. The two countries
intend to build the submarine in their domestic shipyards.
In April 2023, following the completion of the
Defence Strategic Review, conducted by the former
Minister of Defence and the former Chief of the ADF,
the Government released National Defence: Defence
Strategic Review, which includes the Review itself
and the response to the recommendations presented by
the Review on agendas set for Defence’s posture and
structure. The Albanese Government agreed or agreed inprinciple with the recommendations of the Review and
identified priority areas for immediate action, including
the following.
-  Acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines through
AUKUS to improve Australia’s deterrence capabilities
-  Developing the ADF’s ability to precisely strike
targets at longer-range
-  Improving the ADF’s ability to operate from
Australia’s northern bases
In order to achieve the above, the Government
intends to release National Defence Strategy in 2024 and
formulate a Strategy every two years henceforth.
Currently, Australia has approximately 59,800
personnel, and possesses high-performance tanks, vessels,
and aircraft to implement joint operations with the U.S.,
which is an Australia’s alliance partner. Australia also
owns air refueling aircraft and amphibious assault ships


to deploy those assets to distant places. In March 2022,
the Australian Government announced that it would add
18,500 ADF personnel by 2040, an increase of about 30%.

**3 Relations with Foreign Countries**


**(1) Relations with the United States**
Australia and the United States are alliance partners
based on the Security Treaty among Australia, New
Zealand and the United States of America (ANZUS).[2]
In the 2020 Defence Strategic Update, the Australian
Government clearly states that it will continue to deepen
the alliance with the United States acknowledging that
the alliance, including intelligence sharing and defense
industrial and technological cooperation, is critical.
Since 1985, the two countries have been regularly
convening the Australia-United States Ministerial
Consultations (AUSMIN) to discuss major diplomatic
and security issues. In the Joint Statement of AUSMIN
held in Washington D.C. in November 2022, the two
countries stated that the U.S.-Australia alliance had
never been stronger or more vital to regional peace and
stability. They also committed to deepening cooperation,
bilaterally and with regional partners and institutions, to
ensure an Indo-Pacific that is free, open, stable, peaceful,
prosperous, and sovereign of sovereignty.
The United States and Australia have increased the
presence of the U.S. Forces in northern Australia near
the Indo-Pacific. The U.S. Marines began rotational
deployment to northern Australia including Darwin in
2012 based on the Force Posture Initiatives announced
by the leaders of both countries in November 2011 as part
of the rebalance policy of the Obama Administration.
Approximately 2,200 Marines were deployed to the
region in 2022. In addition, the U.S. Air Force have
deployed B-52 strategic bombers and F-22 fighters to
Australia as needed, to conduct combined exercises and
training with the RAAF. The above-mentioned AUSMIN
Joint Statement mentioned to the future rotations of U.S.
Navy and Army capabilities.
The U.S. Armed Forces and the ADF have biennially
conducted the U.S.-Australia combined exercise
Talisman Sabre since 2005 with the objective of
enhancing combat readiness and interoperability. In
2021, amphibious landings and ground force maneuver

were conducted by the U.S. Forces and the ADF, with the
participation of the Canadian, British, and ROK forces,
the SDF, and others.

**(2) Relations with China**
For Australia, China is the biggest trade partner, and
the two countries have conducted various exchanges in
the defense area such as dialogues between the defense
authorities, bilateral exercises, and mutual visiting of
vessels, in addition to exchanges and cooperation in the
political and economic areas.
Meanwhile, Australia has been showing clearly
its wariness toward China including by delivering
Australia’s stance on China .
The Australian Government has been expressing
strong concerns over China’s land reclamation and
construction activities in the South China Sea, and
oppose any unilateral attempts to change or influence
the status quo through militarization of disputed features
and coercive or intimidating actions, while also clearly
expressing its intention to continue to exercise its rights
to freedom of navigation and overflight. Furthermore, the
2017 Foreign Policy White Paper contained statements
to the effect that China was challenging the position of
the United States in the Indo-Pacific, the most important
region for Australia.
People within and outside Australia expressed their
concerns over the lease of facilities by China, including
Port Darwin, which has been used by the Australian and
the U.S. forces fleets. In December 2020, Australian
enacted a law that allows the government to veto
negotiations for future arrangements and terminate
existing agreements between Australian local entities
and foreign entities, that are inconsistent with Australia’s
foreign policy.
As Australia had suggested the necessity for an
independent investigation into the origins of the novel
coronavirus in April 2020, China successively imposed
trade blockages on Australian beef and other goods,
which resulted in the rapid deterioration of the AustraliaChina relation.
In addition, in February 2022, the Australian
Department of Defence announced that a P-8A Poseidon
patrol aircraft of the RAAF had been pointed a laser
by a PLA Navy vessel in the Arafura Sea, Australia’s
northern approaches. Former Prime Minister Morrison
condemned the laser as “an act of intimidation” that
Australia would never accept In response the Chinese


Ministry of National Defense and Ministry of Foreign
Affairs stated that Australia’s claims were “untrue.”
Afterward, the change of Australian government
triggered the restart of foreign and security dialogue
between the countries, and Australia and China held a
defense ministers’ meeting in June 2022 for the first time
in about three years.
Regarding AUKUS, China has claimed that the export
of sensitive nuclear submarine technology to Australia
poses a serious risk of nuclear proliferation and harms
peace and stability of the region although Australia, the
U.K. and the U.S. commit to set the highest nuclear nonproliferation standard, and have continued to consult
with the IAEA.

**(3) Relations with India**
Australia sees India as a security partner in the IndoPacific region that shares national interests.
At the Australia-India summit meeting (held online)
in June 2020, the two countries agreed to elevate the
bilateral relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic
Partnership, and at the summit meeting (held online) in
March 2022, they committed to holding Annual Summits.
In September 2021, the two countries held their
inaugural Australia-India 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue in
New Delhi; and particularly in the defense field, they
agreed to strengthen cooperation in defense technologies,
maritime domain awareness, and operational logistics
support.
Richard Marles, Deputy Prime Minister of Australia
and Minister of Defence, met with Defence Minister
Singh of India in June 2022, and welcomed the increased
diversity and frequency of military exercises and
exchanges between their countries. The two ministers
agreed to build on operational participation through the
Mutual Logistics Support Agreement.
In November 2022, the Royal Australian Navy
participated in the Multilateral Naval Exercise Malabar
among the U.S. Navy, Indian Navy, and the Japan
Maritime Self-Defense Force, as it did in 2021.

Australia has been deepening its relations with
Indonesia in the security and defense fields following
the signing of the Lombok Treaty, a security cooperation
framework, in November 2006, the September 2012
conclusion of the Defence Cooperation Arrangement,
which included the enhancement of cooperation in the
fields of anti-terrorism measures and maritime security.
and the elevation of their relationship to a Comprehensive
Strategic Partnership in August 2018. The bilateral
relationship has been strengthened through initiatives,
including regular Foreign and Defense Ministers
Meetings (2+2), and the signing of an agreement on
maritime security and terrorism, and of a Maritime
Cooperation Plan of Action in 2018.
With Singapore and Malaysia, Australia carries out
regular combined exercises in the South China Sea and
other areas under the Five Power Defence Arrangements
(FPDA; entered into force in 1971) framework, whereby
the two countries, the United Kingdom, Australia, and
New Zealand would consult together in the event of any
form of armed attack or threat of such attack against
Singapore or Malaysia, for the purpose of deciding
what measures should be taken. Australia considers that
Singapore is its most advanced defense partner, and that
they share Australia’s interest in a secure maritime trading
environment. The defense cooperation between the two
countries is also deepening, including the signing of the
Memorandum of Understanding on Military Training


and Training Area Development in Australia under the
Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in October 2016.
Regarding Malaysia, Australia stations the ADF in Royal
Malaysian Air Force Base Butterworth, and contributes
to maintaining regional security and stability through
patrol activities in the South China Sea and the northern
Indian Ocean.
The Albanese Government criticized the former
Morrison Government for failing to intervene the
signing of a framework agreement between Solomon
Islands and China on security cooperation in April 2022,
and announced its basic policy to strengthen engagement
with Pacific Island countries and Timor-Leste. Based on
this policy, the government announced the establishment
of Australia Pacific Defence School to provide training
programs for members of Pacific Island country and
Timor-Leste defense and security forces, and of a Pacific
Climate Infrastructure Financing Partnership to work
with Pacific Island countries for which climate change
is critical, to build new climate resilient infrastructure.
Australia plays a leading role in assisting these
countries in fields such as security maintenance, natural
disasters response, and maritime patrol. In addition,
in the field of maritime patrol, Australia still regularly
deploys ADF assets to the South Pacific to assist with
patrol activities. It also plans to supply the Pacific Island
countries and Timor-Leste with 21 new Guardian-class
patrol boats by 2023.

including capabilities to operate effectively with the
United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and
Canada, and the maintenance of the scale and quality of
New Zealand’s military contributions.
Moreover, the Statement was the first document that
mentioned the impact of climate change and the role of
the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) regarding this
issue, which made a commitment to support the Pacific
Island countries that have been exposed to disasters.
As for the issues in the South China Sea, the Statement
specifically noted China’s militarization in the South
China Sea, stating, “China’s more confident assertion of
its interests has at times raised tensions with neighboring
states and with the United States.”
In addition New Zealand released the Defence

New Zealand’s strategic environment and cited
challenges and other issues, suggesting that the
construction of military facilities and unilateral resource
development, as seen in the South China Sea, could also
occur in the island country region.
In July 2022, then Minister of Defence Henare
announced that the government would review its defense
policy due to issues such as the escalating impacts
of climate change, intensification of geo-strategic
competition including Russia’s aggression against
Ukraine.
As for diplomatic relations, New Zealand has
maintained close relationships with the U.S. and Australia,
and sees Australia as its only formal defense ally.
The U.S. suspended its defense obligation to New
Zealand based on the ANZUS Treaty in 1986, when New


Zealand refused the entrance of a U.S. ship following
New Zealand’s adoption of a nuclear-free policy. On the
other hand, the two countries have strengthened their
relationship in the diplomacy and defense fields through
the Wellington Declaration (2010), which primarily
focuses on strengthening strategic relations in the fields
of foreign policy and military affairs, and the Washington
Declaration (2012), which mainly deals with expanding
defense cooperation. The U.S. has become a close
strategic partner.
While New Zealand has deepened its bilateral
relationship with China through such initiatives as
cooperation for the Belt and Road Initiative and joint air
exercises, it also looks at China with a cautious eye as
noted in the Strategic Defence Policy Statement 2018
and Defence Assessment 2021.

Malaysia’s first defense white paper, which was
published in December 2019, finds its potential to serve
as a bridge between the vast Pacific and Indian Oceans
as the country is divided in two territories—Peninsular
Malaysia, and Sabah and Sarawak, on the island of
Borneo—located between the two oceans. The white
paper also recognizes the fact that, while Malaysia’s
strategic location and natural resources are blessing ones,
they also pose a security challenge to itself. Given these
attributes, Malaysia has historically been affected by
the political dynamics of major powers, and even today,
Malaysia sees in its defense white paper that uncertain
U.S.-China relationship is the most important strategic
challenge for Malaysia.
Based on this recognition, the white paper set up three
pillars in order to defend national interests in each of
three concentric areas, consisting of the Core Area, which
includes both the country’s land masses and territorial
waters; the Extended Area, which encompasses the
surrounding waters and airspace; and the Forward Area,
which incorporates locations beyond the extended area
where Malaysia’s national interests are affected. The
three pillars are: (1) Concentric Deterrence, which aims
to dissuade all forms of external intrusion or conflicts
by strengthening the capability of the nation’s armed
forces; (2) Comprehensive Defense, which seeks to
enhance Malaysia’s internal resilience by whole-ofgovernment and whole of society approaches; and (3)
Credible Partnerships, which focuses on the promotion
of regional stability via the expansion and enhancement
of defense cooperation with other countries as a highly
credible partner.
In connection with the recent continued anchoring of
Chinese vessels around South Luconia Shoal, over which
Malaysia claims sovereignty, Malaysia has announced
that its Navy and maritime law enforcement agencies
would conduct around-the-clock monitoring, and that
Malaysia would protect its sovereignty. In October
2021, a Chinese survey vessel and other vessels entered
Malaysia’s EEZ, which the Malaysian government
protested.
Along with this expression of protest and strengthening
of its maritime defense capabilities, Malaysia has also
striven to bolster its defense posture in eastern Malaysia
including by reportedly identifying suitable land for the
establishment of a new naval base in Bintulu which

Myanmar shares borders with China and India and
is a gateway to the Indian Ocean for China and some
ASEAN countries. In light of these factors, Myanmar is
noted for its strategic significance. Its armed forces had
control over the government following the collapse of
the socialist regime in 1988. However, with an economic
slowdown caused by the economic sanctions imposed by
the West, the transition to civilian rule was completed
based on the road map to democracy.
Myanmar’s parliamentary election was conducted in
November 2020, and the National League for Democracy
(NLD) secured an overwhelming single majority in both
houses with the number of seats significantly higher
than the previous election. However, in February 2021,
then State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and her party’s
senior members were detained by Myanmar’s military,
which was claiming election fraud, and the armed forces
declared a state of emergency to carry out a coup d’état,
and powers were handed over to the commander-inchief. The State Administration Council (SAC) chaired
by Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar Armed Forces
Min Aung Hlaing was formed by the Armed Force. The
Armed Forces controlled information and used force
to suppress civil disobedience movements and protests
against their administration, resulting in numerous
casualties. This unleashed a storm of condemnation from
the international society.
Then, in April of the same year, although the Committee
Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH) instituted by
Pro-Democracy Group declared the establishment of the
National Unity Government (NUG) the Armed Forces


-----

designated them and others as Terrorist Organizations.
After the ASEAN Leaders’ Meeting held the same month
with the presence of a Myanmar military representative,
a “Five-Point Consensus” was agreed to, recognizing
ASEAN’s proactive and constructive role in promoting
a peaceful resolution. In August of the same year, SAC
announced the establishment of an “interim government”
with the commander-in-chief of the Myanmar Armed
Forces as the “provisional prime minister.”
It is pointed out the Armed Forces is expanding
the number of mobilizable manpower including by
announcing its intention to implement the conscription,
and by officially announcing a new police law which
gives the Armed Forces the authority to make the police
engage in defense-related matters.
In March 2022, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister
of Foreign Affairs of Cambodia Prak Sokhonn visited
Myanmar for the first time as the Special Envoy of the
ASEAN Chair to Myanmar, and, from June to July, made
his second visit to Myanmar. Although he met with the
Commander-in-Chief and junta cabinet members, he
could not meet with pro-democracy groups and others. In
July 2022, despite strong appeals from the international
community, the executions of four Myanmar citizens,
including pro-democracy activists, were carried out.
The Chairman’s Statement of the ASEAN Summits
adopted in November 2022 included ASEAN’s
disappointment at the little progress in the implementation
of the Five-Point Consensus by the Myanmar Armed
Forces.
Myanmar has maintained a good relationship with
China since the two countries established diplomatic
relations in 1950 and the country is regarded as a
major supplier of equipment. Myanmar has also
received Chinese aid for pipeline construction and
the development of Kyaukpyu Port. In January 2020,
President Xi Jinping became the first Chinese leader to
visit Myanmar for 19 years and affirmed China’s policy
of promoting economic cooperation through the BRI.
Myanmar maintains a cooperative relationship with
Russia in the military field since the period of the
past military regime, and Russia was a destination for
students from Myanmar and a supplier of major defense
equipment. In July 2022, the Commander-in-Chief visited
Russia, and discussed promotion of defense cooperation
with the Deputy Defense Minister. Furthermore, in
September 2022, the Commander-in-Chief met President
Putin for the first time in Vladivostok to exchange


views on cooperation in all sectors, emphasizing their
good bilateral relations.
As for India, since the transition to civilian rule,
Myanmar has deepened cooperative relations in the
fields of the economy and military, which resulted in
defense cooperation and exchanges such as the hosting
of various seminars and friendly visits to Myanmar by
Indian naval vessels.
Cooperative relations with North Korea, including
weapons trades, were maintained under Myanmar’s
military regime in the past. Following the transition to
democracy, although Myanmar denied its military ties to
North Korea, the report issued by the Panel of Experts of
the UN Security Council Sanctions Committee on North
Korea in March 2018 reported that the country received
a ballistic missile system and other weapons from North
Korea.

**4 The Philippines**


**Part**
**Ⅰ**

**Chapter**


The Philippines considers that its archipelagic attributes
and geographic location are a source of both strength and
vulnerability. Moreover, the country sees that its strategic
location and rich natural resources have also provided a
strong temptation to expansionist powers. Based on this
perception, although resolving internal armed conflicts
remains its top security concern, rising tensions in the
South China Sea have prompted the Philippines to give
the same attention to territorial defense as it does to
internal security threats.
The Philippines, with a historically close relationship
with the United States, has maintained a cooperative
relationship with the U.S. under Mutual Defense Treaty
and Military Assistance Agreement, even after the
withdrawal of the U.S. Forces in 1992.
In February 1998, the two countries signed the
Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), which prescribes the
legal status of U.S. military personnel when the U.S.
Forces conducts combined military exercises or other
related activities in the Philippines.
Furthermore, in April 2014, the two countries signed
the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA)
that allows capability development of the Armed Forces
of the Philippine (AFP), enhanced cooperation in
disaster relief, rotational deployment of the U.S. Forces,
construction and improvement of agreed locations in the
Philippines by the U.S., and U.S. Forces’ prepositioning
of equipment supplies and material In March 2016


-----

the two countries agreed on five bases of the AFP for
carrying out defense cooperation under the EDCA.
Although former President Duterte notified the United
States its intention to terminate the VFA in February
2020, he decided to withdraw the notice in July 2021.
In recent years, the two countries have been conducting
various military exercises, including large-scale exercise
Balikatan, amphibious exercise KAMANDAG, and
maritime exercise Sama Sama.
President Marcos, who took office in June 2022,
met with President Biden of the U.S. for the first time
in person in September 2022 in New York. The two
leaders discussed the situation in the South China Sea,
and underscored their support for freedom of navigation
and overflight and the peaceful resolution of disputes.
In November 2022, Vice President Harris of the U.S.
clearly stated that an armed attack on the Philippines
armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft in the South
China Sea would invoke the U.S. Mutual Defense
Treaty. In February 2023, defense ministers of the U.S.
and Philippines announced the agreement to designate
four new agreed locations for the EDCA, and, in April,
announced the location of the four sites. Furthermore,
in May 2023, the U.S.-Philippines Bilateral Defense
Guidelines were adopted and released for the first time,
which serve as a roadmap of modernization of alliance
cooperation and deepening interoperability between the
U.S. and the Philippines. Thus, the defense cooperation
between the two countries has begun to progress again
since the inauguration of the new administration.
The Philippines and China have competing claims
over the sovereignty in the Spratly Islands and
Scarborough Shoal of the South China Sea. In January
2013, seeking a settlement under international law, the

President Marcos of the Philippines giving his state of the nation address (July 2022) i


Philippines started arbitral tribunal proceedings pursuant
to UNCLOS against China. In July 2016, the final award
was rendered, accepting nearly all of the Philippines’
submissions. The Government of the Philippines
released a statement that it welcomed the award by the
arbitral tribunal and strongly affirmed its respect for the
decision.
In July 2022, President Marcos emphasized in the
state of the nation address his stance that he would
preside over any process that will abandon even one
square inch of Philippine territory. Furthermore, in the
same month, the Department of Foreign Affairs of the
Philippines released a statement commemorating the
sixth anniversary of the award.
The conflicts between the Philippines and China over
the South China Sea dispute were observed even after
2020 during which the COVID-19 infections became
a global pandemic. The Philippines protested that a
Chinese military vessel had directed fire-control radars
at a Philippine Navy ship in February 2020, and that
China had established administrative districts on islands
in the South China Sea in April of the same year.
Moreover, regarding the fact that 220 Chinese militia
ships swarmed at Whitsun Reef in March 2021, the
Department of National Defense of the Philippines
accused China of conducting “a clear provocation of the
militarization” of the South China Sea and demanded
China to remove ships. In response, China claimed its
sovereignty over Whitsun Reef, and then denied the
existence of Chinese militia ships and explained “some
fishing ships had to shelter at Whitsun Reef from the bad
weather.”
In January 2023, President Marcos met with President
Xi Jinping during his state visit to China. The two leaders
had an in-depth and frank discussion on the South China
Sea and agreed to appropriately manage differences
through peaceful means. In addition, they also agreed
on the arrangement to establish a “direct communication
mechanism” to prevent possible miscommunication
between the foreign authorities of the two countries.

**Chapter**


Given its limited land area, population, and resources,
Singapore’s existence and development depend on
the peace and stability of the region in a globalized


-----

economy. Singapore gives high priority to national
defense, with defense spending accounting for about
10% of its national budget. In October 2022, the
Digital and Intelligence Service was established as the
fourth service of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF),
integrating existing command, control, communications,
computers, intelligence and cyber capabilities.
Singapore emphasizes the importance of cooperative
relations with ASEAN and the FPDA,[3] and has concluded
defense cooperation agreements with countries within
and outside the region.
With the aim of contributing to peace and stability in
the region, Singapore supports United States’ presence
in the Asia-Pacific and permits it to use military facilities
in Singapore. Since 2013, U.S. littoral combat ships
(LCSs) began their rotational deployments. In December
2015, the P-8 patrol aircraft of the U.S. Forces were
deployed to Singapore for around one week for the first
time. The two countries have committed to continuing
to carry out similar deployments routinely. In addition,
Singapore conducts combined exercises with the U.S.,
such as CARAT and SEACAT.
Singapore has strong economic ties with China, and
the two countries also conduct bilateral naval exercises.
In October 2019, the two countries signed the enhanced
Agreement on Defence Exchanges and Security
Cooperation (ADESC). On the other hand, diplomatic
relations with China have been strained partly due
to Singapore’s advocacy of the ruling of the arbitral
tribunal to Philippines v. China when it comes to the
resolution of the South China Sea disputes and partly
due to Singapore’s defense cooperation with Taiwan.
Singapore concluded the Bilateral Agreement for
Navy Cooperation with India in November 2017, and the
two countries undertake the maritime exercise Singapore
India Maritime Bilateral Exercise (SIMBEX), ground
exercise “Agni Warrior,” and air exercise Joint Military
Training (JMT) among other activities.
In March 2020, Singapore and Australia signed
the Treaty on Military Training and Training Area
Development in Australia. This treaty enables the
Singapore Armed Forces to access Australia’s newly
developed training area.


**6 Thailand**


Thailand’s defense policy includes: strengthening
defense cooperation through ASEAN, international
organizations, and other entities; defense that makes
comprehensive use of political, economic, and other
national strengths; and effective defense aimed at
increasing the readiness of the Royal Thai Armed Forces
(RTAF) and developing the defense industry.
Under its flexible omni-directional diplomatic policy,
Thailand pursues cooperation with other Southeast Asian
countries and coordination with major countries.
Particularly with the United States, the U.S.-Thailand
combined exercise Cobra Gold has been conducted since
1982, and is currently one of the largest multilateral
training in Southeast Asia. In addition, the marine corps
of the two countries have continued their combined naval
training CARAT and counter-piracy and trafficking
exercise SEACAT.
Thailand and China have conducted combined
training such as Blue Strike between their marines and
Falcon Strike between their air forces.

Based on its viewpoint that the sea is closely associated
with the national construction and defense, Vietnam has
established the objective of becoming a strong marine
country, particularly prioritizing the modernization of
its military forces and law enforcement forces at sea
as well as ensuring the capability for maritime domain
awareness, maritime independence, sovereign rights,
jurisdiction and national interests at sea.
Vietnam deploys its omni-directional diplomatic
policy and intends to actively participate in international
and regional cooperation in order to build friendly
relations with every nation. In March 2016, Vietnam
opened an international port in the Cam Ranh Bay, which
is located in a strategically important location, and Navy
vessels from many countries including Japan have called
at the international Cam Ranh Bay port.
Vietnam and the United States have strengthened their
military relations in recent years. This has taken such
forms as combined training with the U.S. Navy and port
calls by U.S. Navy vessels in Vietnam. In 2017, mutual

visits were conducted by the leaders of both countries,
and an agreement was reached on the deepening of
defense cooperation. March 2018 marked the first port
call by a U.S. aircraft carrier to Vietnam after the end of
the Vietnam war. In addition, the U.S. aircraft carrier and
cruiser made a call at Da Nang in March 2020. In June
2022, Minister of Defense Phan Van Giang of Vietnam
met with Secretary of Defense Austin of the U.S., and the
two agreed to seek additional opportunities to advance
practical cooperation in support of both nations’ shared
security objectives.
Vietnam and Russia continue to strengthen cooperation
in the area of national defense, with Vietnam dependent
on Russia for the majority of its defense equipment.
In April 2018, the two countries signed a military and
technical cooperation roadmap, while in July 2019, a
Vietnamese naval vessel visited the port of Vladivostok
for the first time. In December 2019, a submarine rescue
vessel from Russia’s Pacific Fleet visited the port of
Cam Ranh and participated in the first bilateral joint
submarine rescue exercise.

Vietnam and China, under their comprehensive
strategic cooperation partnership relations, proactively
conduct high level government official exchanges while
the countries have conflicts over territorial sovereignty
in the South China Sea.
The defense white paper published in November 2019


demonstrates an acknowledgement that Vietnam and
China need to resolve the territorial disputes with special
precaution, avoiding negative impacts on general peace,
friendship, and cooperation for development between
the two countries. As such, it recognizes that the two
countries should continue negotiations and consultations
to find peaceful solutions on the basis of international law.
On the other hand, it is also pointed out that, while still
falling short of the scale of the China’s past reclamation,
Vietnam has accelerated and expanded landfill work at
several of its outposts in Spratly Islands, where Vietnam
is competing for territorial rights against China.[4]

Vietnam and India have been deepening their
cooperative relationship in a broad range of areas,
including security and the economy, under a
comprehensive strategic partnership. In the area
of defense cooperation, it is noted that the Indian
Armed Forces support the training of Vietnam’s Navy
submarine personnel and Air Force pilots, and Indian
Navy vessels make friendly visits to Vietnam. In June
2022, Minister of Defense Phan Van Giang of Vietnam
met with Minister of Defence Singh of India, and set
forth the policy under which the scope and scale of
bilateral defense cooperation are enhanced significantly
by signing the Joint Vision Statement on India-Vietnam
Defence Partnership towards 2030.

In recent years, Southeast Asian countries have increased
their defense spending against the backdrop of economic
development and other reasons, and are modernizing
their military forces, focusing on inducting equipment
such as submarines and fighters, including fourthgeneration fighters.
In addition, each country strives to enhance ISR
capabilities including by acquiring vessels and unmanned
vehicles, against a background of disputes over territorial
rights in the South China Sea.
Indonesia plans to acquire 42 Rafale fighters from
France, and is negotiating with the United States for
the procurement of 36 F-15EX fighters. With the


ROK, Indonesia concluded an agreement to purchase
three ROK-made 209-class submarines, the first two
of which were built in Korea and the third was built
in Indonesia. In January 2016, the two countries also
concluded a detailed agreement on cost sharing and
bilateral cooperation in the joint development of the
4.5 generation fighter jet KF-21. Indonesia introduced
ScanEagle UAVs from the United States. As well as
showcasing Chinese CH-4 UAVs at an October 2019
celebration for Indonesian National Armed Forces Day,
in December 2019 Indonesia unveiled the prototype
Black Eagle UAV, a domestically produced unmanned
aerial vehicle that has incorporated several aspects of the


-----

CH-4.
Malaysia announced a plan to build six indigenous
LCSs. The first of these vessels was launched in August
2017. Furthermore, by December 2021, Malaysia
introduced four littoral mission ships (LMSs) from China.
Malaysia also introduced ScanEagle reconnaissance
UAVs from the United States.
Myanmar received a Kilo-class submarine from
India in December 2019, and in December 2021,
commissioned its Ming-class submarine received from
China. The procurement of the country’s submarine
is attracting attention from neighboring countries.
Furthermore, Myanmar introduced Su-30 fighters from
Russia by December 2022.
The Philippines has taken steps in recent years to
modernize its defense equipment against the backdrop
of conflicts over territorial rights in the South China Sea.
In terms of air force capabilities, between November
2015 and May 2017, the Philippines successively
introduced 12 FA-50PH light fighters purchased from
the ROK. The Philippines is currently planning to
acquire multi-role fighters. The candidates are JAS-39
Gripen from Sweden and F-16 fighters from the U.S.
The Philippines also received six A-29 light attack
aircraft from Brazil in October 2020, and ScanEagle
reconnaissance UAVs from the United States in
November 2020. Furthermore, a procurement contract
for a supersonic cruise missile “BrahMos” from India
was concluded in January 2022.
As for naval forces, the Philippines received three
Hamilton-class frigates from the United States by
2016. The Philippines introduced two Indonesian-made
landing dock vessels by 2017. In addition, two frigates
were introduced from the ROK by March 2021. The
August 2019 commissioning of a Pohang-class corvette
received from the ROK marked the restoration of the
antisubmarine capability that the Philippines had long
lacked. That September, the Philippines conducted the


DAGIT-PA multi-service military exercise involving the
army, navy, and air force, during which the four AAV7 assault amphibious vehicles that it had commissioned
the previous June were operated.
Singapore is actively striving to modernize its forces.
Today, it is one of the largest arms importers in the world.
It introduced 24 U.S.-made F-15 fighters by 2012 and
also participates in the F-35 JSF Program. In January
2020, the U.S. Government officially approved the sale
of F-35B fighter jets to Singapore.
As for Thailand, in July 2014, the country established
the Submarine Squadron Headquarters. In April 2017,
the Royal Thai Navy drew up a plan to purchase three
Yuan-class submarines from China over the next 11
years, and the Thai Cabinet approved the purchase of
one vessel. However, in April 2020, Thailand announced
that it would postpone the procurement of two Yuanclass submarines from China in order to secure the
budget for COVID-19 countermeasures. In addition, the
Cabinet approved in September 2012 a plan to introduce
two frigates. The first frigate was received from the ROK
in December 2018. In September 2019, Thailand signed
an agreement to purchase a Type 071 landing platform
dock from China. In addition, by 2013, Thailand had
introduced 12 Swedish-made JAS-39 Gripen fighters
and received 35 of the 60 Stryker armored vehicles
purchased from the United States.
By January 2017, Vietnam successively introduced six
Russian-made Kilo-class submarines. By February 2018,
Vietnam started the operation of four Russian-made
Gepard-class frigates. As for its air force capabilities,
Vietnam started to successively introduce Russian-made
Su-30 fighters in 2004, and to date, the total number of
delivered Su-30 fighters came to 36. In January 2020,
it was reported that Vietnam had ordered 12 Yak-130
training aircraft from Russia. Thailand also introduced
ScanEagle reconnaissance UAVs from the United States.

According to the Indian Navy’s Maritime Security Strategy, “Sea Denial” is a concept of denying the adversary the use of a particular maritime space, for a period of time when it is not required for
one’s own use.

India raises its continued commitment to the goal of a nuclear weapon free world, along with credible minimum deterrent, “No First Use” policy, and its policy of no use against non-nuclear weapon

**1 General Situation**

Wedged between the powerful South Asian nation of
India and politically-unstable Afghanistan, and sharing
borders with China and Iran, Pakistan is placed in a
geopolitically significant and complex position.
Pakistan places importance on cooperation with other
Islamic countries because much of the population is
Muslim, while friendly relations with Western countries
are maintained. Pakistan is promoting its relationship
with China in all fields under the All Weather Strategic
Cooperative Partnership. Pakistan’s relationship with
Afghanistan becomes more and more complicated
because the border is still not concluded with Taliban

Pakistan takes the position that maintaining nuclear
deterrence against attacks with nuclear and conventional
weapons by India is essential to ensure national
security and self-defense. Pakistan is believed to retain
around 165 nuclear warheads as of January 2022. The
development of ballistic missiles and cruise missiles
capable of carrying nuclear warheads is still continuing.
Tactical nuclear missile Nasr and IRBM Shaheen-II are
already operative. In addition, the flight test of groundto-ground missile Shaheen-III with the range of 2,750
km was successfully conducted in April 2022.

**3 Relations with Other Countries**


**2 Military Affairs**

Pakistan stated in its comprehensive policy document
“National Security Policy 2022-2026” formulated in
December 2021 that it will deter any aggression by
maintaining highly adaptable armed forces that are
highly cost effective, with a focus on modernization
and optimization of force structure. It also stated that at
the same time it will build up the capabilities to combat
against hybrid warfare including disinformation and
influence operations by enhancing information and
cybersecurity capabilities. In recent years, Pakistan has
also been promoting the modernization of equipment, and
while it makes attempts at domestic production through
joint development of equipment and technology transfer,
it promotes its relationship with China in military fields,
and rising of dependence to China is observed.
Pakistan is believed to have a large and well trained
army to ensure safety in the border region and to deal
with extremists. AL-Khalid tanks developed jointly with
China are operated as main battle tanks (MBTs), and
Chinese VT-4 tanks were introduced in October 2021.
Pakistan also enhanced the Comprehensive Layered
Integrated Air Defense (CLIAD) system by purchasing
air defense systems such as LY-80 and HQ-9/P from
China.
The Pakistan Navy promotes replacement of
deteriorated warships and reinforcement, and the
introduction of submarines. Pakistan agreed with China
on the procurement of eight Hangor-class submarines,
of which four will be built domestically with technical
transfer. The building of Pakistan’s first domestic
submarine started in the Karachi dockyard in December
2022. Furthermore, a purchase contract for four
MILGEM-class corvettes was concluded with Turkey,
and two of those vessels will be built domestically as a
part of a technology transfer agreement. The launching
ceremony of the third corvette was held in Turkey in
November 2022.
The Pakistan Air Force operates JF-17 Block I/
II fighters jointly developed with China and produced
domestically, and stated that the production of JF-17
Block III fighters had begun. It also announced the
introduction of Chinese J-10C fighters in March 2022.
Furthermore, the Turkish company Baykar announced
that it finished flight training for attack UAV Bayraktar
Akinji for the Pakistan Air Force in October 2022.
Introduction of the UAV is anticipated in the future

**(1) Relations with the United States**
The United States designated Pakistan as a “Major NonNATO ally” in 2004 and has strengthened the relationship
because Pakistan has cooperated with the United States in
the field of counterterrorism since the terrorist attacks of
September 11, 2001. However, Pakistan has repeatedly
protested against counterterrorism operations of the
United States, such as in its request for the immediate
stop of drone attacks in Pakistani territory. In response
to this, the United States has condemned Pakistan over
the government’s approval for Islam extremists taking
actions in Afghanistan to take haven in Pakistan, which
poses a threat to the United States, and halted support
related to security. In this way, tension in the bilateral
relationship continues.
On the other hand, improvement of the relationship
with the United States has been seen under the Sharif
administration established in April 2022. The minister of
foreign affairs of Pakistan visited the United States in
May 2022 by invitation of the U.S. Secretary of State, and
at the meeting of foreign ministers, peace in the region,
counterterrorism, stabilization of Afghanistan, and
importance of cooperation for support for Ukraine were
emphasized. In September 2022, the U.S. Department
of State decided to approve the contract of a maximum
US$450 million related to maintenance and support of
F-16 fighter jets for Pakistan, to facilitate counterterrorism
operations. Furthermore, General Bajwa, Chief of Army
Staff of Pakistan, visited the United States in October
2022 for the first time in three years and met with U.S.
Secretary of Defense Austin. Attention will be focused
on bilateral defense cooperation including counter
terrorism in the future.

occurred along the Line of Control, and the two countries
repeatedly restarted and suspended dialogue. Finally, the
countries agreed to comply with the ceasefire in February
2021. The Ministry of Defence of India stated in

India asserts the accession of Kashmir to India, based on the Instrument of Accession document by which the ruler of Kashmir acceded to India at the time of Pakistan’s independence, and contends

disinformation countermeasures among other issues.
Through these actions, NATO has emphasized one
of its core missions of defending member states while
strengthening deterrence and defense capabilities based
on an understanding of how the situation has drastically
changed.
Even before Russia’s aggression against Ukraine
in February 2022, NATO and its member states have
recognized the threat posed by Russia and worked to
bolster deterrence following Russia’s development of
hybrid warfare and frequent “unusual flights” by Russian
Armed Forces aircraft over northern and eastern Europe,
including the Baltic states.
At the NATO Summit in September 2014, leaders
adopted a joint declaration demanding Russia to retract
its “annexation” of Crimea and adopted the Readiness
Action Plan (RAP) for enhancing existing readiness
forces.[1] Based on this plan, NATO has continued to
maintain its presence in eastern allies, while steps have
been taken to significantly improve the readiness of the
existing multinational NATO Response Force (NRF) and
create a Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) that
can be mobilized within two to three days. Furthermore,
at the NATO Summit in July 2016, members decided
to deploy four multinational battle groups to the three
Baltic nations and Poland on a rotational basis. These
became fully operational in 2017.
Meanwhile, Russia’s aggression against Ukraine has
started and NATO has further shifted its emphasis to the
defense of Eastern Europe with Russia in mind .
At an extraordinary summit held in February 2022
after the aggression, NATO announced the deployment
of the NRF to the East European region to provide
reassurance. At a summit in March 2022, it decided to
deploy four newly organized battle groups to Bulgaria,
Romania, Hungary, and Slovakia respectively.
In addition, at a NATO Summit in June 2022, in
response to the new security environment, NATO stated
that some of the battle groups deployed in Eastern
Europe would be enhanced from battalion level to
brigade level, the NRF would be enhanced from 40,000
to 300,000 personnel in strength, and a new model with


**1 NATO**

Founded for the core task of collective defense among
member states, NATO has expanded the scope of its
activities to conflict prevention and crisis management
since the end of the Cold War. NATO’s three core
tasks are deterrence and defense, crisis prevention and
management, and cooperative security.
Amid an increasing sense of crisis among member
states in response to Russia’s aggression against
Ukraine, a new NATO Strategic Concept was adopted
at the NATO Summit in June 2022 for the first time in
twelve years since 2010. Although the previous Strategic
Concept stated that the Euro-Atlantic area is at peace
and the threat of a conventional attack against NATO
territory is low, this new Strategic Concept states that
the Euro-Atlantic area is not at peace and the possibility
of an attack against Allies’ sovereignty and territorial
integrity cannot be discounted.
Furthermore, NATO placed Russia as the most
significant and direct threat to Allies’ security and to
peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area in this
version, while in the previous version NATO stated that
it was aiming for “a true strategic partnership” with
Russia.
This version mentioned China for the first time,
stating that China’s ambition and coercive policies are
the challenge against NATO’s interests, security, and
values. The Strategic Concept also pointed out that the
deepening relationship between China and Russia and
their mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut the rulesbased international order run counter to NATO’s values
and interests.
In addition to this, it mentioned the nuclear and missile
development by North Korea for the first time, and stated
that the Indo-Pacific region is an important region and
NATO will strengthen dialogue and cooperation with
the partners, as it can directly affect Euro-Atlantic
security. NATO invited Japan, Australia, New Zealand,
and the ROK as the four Asia-Pacific partners (AP4) to
the NATO Summit held in June 2022, and decided to
enhance cooperation with them on maritime security and

high flexibility and readiness would be established,
including the introduction of an Area of Responsibility
(AOR) system, and so on.
Additionally, alongside collective defense, NATO’s
core tasks include operations to prevent and control
crises from inside and/or outside of member states.
In the Mediterranean, a permanent maritime force
has been deployed due to increase in the influx of illegal
immigrants transiting the Mediterranean. This force
monitors the influx of illegal immigrants and shares
information. Also, a wider array of missions including
counterterrorism and capacity building assistance have
been conducted. In the Middle East, with regard to the
Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), NATO has
dispatched early warning and control aircraft forces and
implemented NATO surveillance and reconnaissance
missions since October 2016. It is also supporting
security units of Iraqi Armed Forces on training and
capacity building. At the Meeting of NATO Ministers of
Defense in February 2021, participants agreed to increase
strength from approximately 500 to 4,000 personnel and
on the expansion of mission locations. NATO is also
carrying out missions in Kosovo and other countries.
It was decided in the Madrid Summit Declaration at
the NATO Summit in June 2022 that the commitment to
defense expenditure from 2024 onwards is to be decided
after 2023. In addition, NATO Secretary General
Stoltenberg suggested in November 2022 that the target
for defense expenditures of member states would be
raised in the future, and stated that spending 2% of GDP
for defense should be more as a kind of floor than a
ceiling.
In response to Russia’s aggression against Ukraine,
Finland reversed its longstanding policy of military nonalignment and applied for NATO membership in May
2022. Finland became a full member of NATO on April
4, 2023. This brought the total number of NATO member
states to 31.

**2 EU**


In December 2017, the Permanent Structured
Cooperation (PESCO) was launched as a defense
cooperation framework comprising 25 of the member
states. NATO made it clear that it promotes developing new
capabilities in aviation and maritime domains, training
and support for armed forces, and sharing expertise of
specific domains such as the cyberspace domain through
this framework. It is expected that Europe’s defense
capabilities will be strengthened further.[3] In this way,
the EU is trying to enhance capabilities for undertaking
security and its strategic autonomy by responding to the
present and future security demands in Europe.
Furthermore, the EU is enhancing its engagement
to the Indo-Pacific region, disclosing its first IndoPacific strategy in April 2021 followed by a joint
communication detailing it in September 2021. This
joint communication states that the growing tensions
resulting from China’s significant military buildup and
show of force in the East China Sea, South China Sea,
and Taiwan Strait have a direct effect on security and
prosperity in Europe. To achieve the aim of a rulesbased international order, partnership with countries
sharing the same values, including Japan, is necessary,
along with the reinforcement of economic relations with
Taiwan, including through trading and investments.
In March 2022, the European Council adopted a
“Strategic Compass” laying out a common strategic
vision for security and defense policies in the next five to
ten years. The document stated that the EU will establish
a fully operational EU Rapid Deployment Capacity of up
to 5,000 troops by 2025 for use in rescue and evacuation
operations.

Advancements have been seen in cooperation between
NATO and the EU in addressing unprecedented
challenges efficiently. NATO and the EU published
joint declarations in 2016 and 2018. The two are still
promoting cooperation in a complementary manner,
including enhancing cooperation in the fields such
as dealing with hybrid threats, the cybersecurity, and
counterterrorism.
The Joint Declaration on EU-NATO cooperation was


The EU seeks to enhance its security initiatives under
the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and
Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).[2]


The EU, although it has a property of non-binding multilateral cooperation, introduced the CFSP, which covers all areas of foreign and security policy based on the Treaty of Maastricht, which took
effect in 1993. In June 1999, the European Council decided to implement the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) to offer peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance activities in conflict
areas, as a part of the CFSP framework. The Treaty of Lisbon, made effective in 2009, renamed the ESDP to CSDP and clearly positioned it as an integral part of the CFSP.

signed in January 2023, for the first time in four years.
NATO and the EU stated in the declaration that they were
at a key juncture for Euro-Atlantic security and stability,
and that China’s growing assertiveness and policies
present challenges that need to be addressed. In addition,
it was stated that NATO would further strengthen their
cooperation in existing areas in order to deal with the
security threats and challenges evolving in scope and


magnitude, and that NATO and the EU would enhance
and deepen cooperation especially to deal with growing
geostrategic competition, resilience issues, protection
of critical infrastructure, emerging and disruptive
technologies, space, security implication of climate
change as well as foreign information manipulation and
interference.

measures. For example, a carrier strike group led by
aircraft carrier HMS “Queen Elizabeth” was deployed
to the Indo-Pacific, conducted bilateral training with
the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF), and
executed capacity building and enhanced training with
ASEAN countries in 2021.
In addition, the U. K. has conducted monitoring and
surveillance activities in waters around Japan, including
in the East China Sea, against illegal maritime activities
such as illicit ship-to-ship transfer with North Korean
ships since 2018. For example, the offshore patrol vessel
HMS “Tamar” conducted monitoring and surveillance
activities in mid-January, early February, late February,
and late September 2022.
In addition, the United Kingdom and France agreed
during a U.K.-France Summit meeting held in March
2023 that the two countries would coordinate the
deployment of aircraft carriers in regions with shared
interests, and stated that they would show the presence
of European carrier strike groups in the Indo-Pacific
region in a more sustained manner.

**1 The United Kingdom**

After the end of the Cold War, the United Kingdom,
perceiving that there is no direct military threat against
the country, has advanced national defense reform with
particular focus on improving its overseas deployment
capability and readiness, in order to deal with new
threats such as international terrorism and proliferation
of WMDs.
The Johnson administration (then) published
the Integrated Review 2021 for security, defense,
development, and diplomatic policy in March 2021. The
administration set forth a framework of the Indo-Pacific
tilt while maintaining and strengthening the relationship
with the United States, European countries, and NATO.
Furthermore, Prime Minister Sunak announced the
Integrated Review Refresh 2023 in March 2023. In the
2023 Refresh, the administration stated that the U. K.
considers the Euro-Atlantic region as the first-order
priority and Russia as “the most acute threat.” It also
stated that the U. K. would enhance NATO further,
and contest the malign Russian influence by exposing
disinformation. Furthermore, it stated that the U. K.
consider the Indo-Pacific as a permanent pillar of the
U. K.’s international policy, support for the concept of a
free and open Indo-Pacific and adopt a policy to enhance
its commitment in the Indo-Pacific through various
measures such as building deep relations anchored in
decades-long economic, technological and security
ties with partners including Japan. In addition, the
administration evaluated that China “poses an epochdefining and systematic challenge.”
In respect of the U.K.’s commitment to the IndoPacific region, the U.K. Government showed its posture
to work with Indo-Pacific partners to uphold freedom
of navigation and international law through various


Since the end of the Cold War, France has focused on
maintaining independence of its defense policies, while
having led initiatives to enhance the defense structure and
capability in Europe. It has worked on the development
of its military capacity by streamlining and integrating
military bases, dealing with operational requirements to
strengthen its defense capability, as well as enhancing
its intelligence capabilities and modernizing equipment
required in the future.
The Macron administration presented in November
2022 the National Strategic Review 2022 (Revue
Nationale Stratégique 2022) that showed an analysis of


-----

the security environment home and abroad, as well as its
strategic goals and priorities for 2030. The administration
also stated that the relationship with Russia transferred
from potential competition to an open opposition, and
its relationship with China transfers to a more intense
contest. In addition, the review indicated enhanced
strategic autonomy and secured nuclear deterrence as
France’s strategic objectives to be achieved by 2030.
Since France has territories in the Indo-Pacific region,
it is the only EU member state that has continuous
military presence in the region, with approximately
7,150 personnel and vessels permanently stationed.
France places importance on commitment to the
region. The Defense Strategy in the Indo-Pacific,
which was published in June 2019, states that China’s
growing influence is shifting the balance of power in
the Indo-Pacific region and highlights the importance
of strengthening partnerships with the United States,
Australia, India, and Japan.[4] The National Strategic
Review 2022 mentioned above stated that France will
strategically strive to build partnerships with countries
in the Indo-Pacific region, including Japan, and play
the role of a balancing power in order to maintain the
strategic stability of the region.
In line with its policy of active participation in the
Indo-Pacific region, France deployed an aircraft carrier
group including the aircraft carrier “Charles de Gaulle”
to the Indian Ocean in March 2019 and dispatched the
training fleet “Jeanne d’Arc” to the Indo-Pacific region
in May 2021 to participate in the Japan-France-U.S.Australia quadrilateral naval training “ARC 21,” during
which time the frigate “Surcouf” and amphibious assault
ship “Tonnerre” called at ports of Japan. France has also
conducted monitoring and surveillance activities against
illicit maritime activities including ship-to-ship transfer
with North Korean vessels since 2019. The Frigate
“Vendémiaire” conducted for the fourth time monitoring
and surveillance activities by French Navy vessels in
mid-March 2022, and a “Falcon 200” reconnaissance
aircraft conducted for the third time monitoring and
surveillance activities by French aircraft from midOctober to early November.
In addition, having positioned the fight against ISIL
as one of its top national defense priorities, France has
been conducting airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq since


September 2014 and in Syria since September 2015. In
addition, France has continued to provide education and
training to the Iraqi Security Forces and Peshmerga, as
well as humanitarian assistance for refugees.
Although France had conducted the Operation
Barkhane for counterterrorism in five countries in the
Sahel region from 2014 and French-led European special
force “Task Force Takuba” started its operation in July
2019, France announced in June 2021 the reduction of
troops dispatched in Mali because of continued political
unrest in the area. France announced the withdrawal of
dispatched units from Mali and redeployment to Niger
in February 2022, due to the worsening relations with
Mali, which had strengthened its relations with Russia.
France concluded the activities of “Takuba” in Mali in
June 2022, completed withdrawal from Mali in August
2022, and announced the completion of the Operation
Barkhane in November 2022.
In January 2020, France and seven other European
nations, including the Netherlands and Denmark, issued
a political statement supporting the creation of the
European Maritime Awareness in the Strait of Hormuz
(EMASOH) surveillance mission, which has been
launched in response to a series of incidents affecting
the safe passage of civilian vessels in the Gulf of Oman
since May 2019.

While Germany has been implementing a large-scale
reduction of its military personnel since the end of the
Cold War, it has been gradually expanding the dispatch
of its federal forces overseas. At the same time, Germany
has advanced the reform of its armed forces to enable
them to execute multiple responsibilities encompassing
conflict prevention and risk management in the context
of multilateral organizations, including NATO, the EU,
and the UN. However, following a worsening in the
security environment, in May 2016 Germany changed
policy and announced that it would increase military
personnel by around 7,000 by 2023.
The country’s defense white paper released in
July 2016 for the first time in about 10 years explains
that Germany’s security environment has grown
more complex and unstable, causing gradually rising


Meanwhile, the French government strongly condemned the United States and Australia because of Australia’s cancellation of the purchase contract for French-built submarines resulting from the


-----

uncertainty, citing specific threats such as international
terrorism, cyber attacks, interstate conflict, and the influx
of refugees and immigrants. The white paper also states
that Germany would continue to emphasize multilateral
cooperation and cross-government approaches, while
striving to realize rules-based international order.
The German government greatly changed its defense
policy in response to Russia’s aggression against Ukraine
in February 2022, started weapon provision to Ukraine,
and stated that the government will raise the defense
budget from 1.5% of GDP to 2% of GDP and maintain
it every year, devoting energy to building up its defense
capability. In response to this, Germany’s parliament
passed a legislation related to reform of the Basic Law
for the Federal Republic of Germany (Grundgesetz fur
die Bundesrepublik Deutschland) in order to establish
and execute a Bundeswehr special fund of 100 billion
euros in June 2022.
In addition, a cabinet decision was made to conclude
the Policy Guidelines for the Indo-Pacific region, which
stipulated diplomatic guidelines for the Indo-Pacific, in
September 2020. In the guidelines, Germany stated its
intention to strengthen its security policy engagement
in the Indo-Pacific region and articulated its stance of
emphasizing cooperation with partner countries with
shared values, including Japan. As specific initiatives,
monitoring UN sanctions against North Korea, taking
part in exercises in the region, expanding the forms of
maritime presence, expanding cybersecurity cooperation
and other efforts are mentioned. The German Navy
deployed a frigate “Bayern” to the Indo-Pacific region
in August 2021. After “Bayern” conducted joint training
with the MSDF and called at a port in Japan for the
first time in two decades in November of that year, it
has undertaken maritime surveillance operations against
illegal maritime activities in Japan’s surrounding waters,
including in the East China Sea, such as illicit ship-toship transfers with North Korean vessels, the first time a
German warship has done this.
A deployment training Rapid Pacific 2022 was
commenced in August 2022, in which thirteen aircraft
including Eurofighter 2000 fighter jets departed
Germany and landed in Singapore within 24 hours. After
that, German troops participated in the multilateral air
exercise Pitch Black as well as the multilateral naval
exercise Kakadu hosted by Australia and conducted
Japan-Germany a joint fighter training for the first time
in Japan to strengthen Germany’s presence in the Indo


Pacific region. Attention will be gathered on German
engagement to the area, because Germany is considered
to be a continuous assets provider for this region in the
future.

**Part**
**Ⅰ**

**Chapter**


In a National Defence Policy paper published in June
2017, the Department of National Defence of Canada
showed its recognition that the United States is “still
unquestionably the only superpower,” while also stating
the view that a degree of major power competition has
returned among China, Russia, and others, which is
causing the growing importance of deterrence again.
In accordance with this understanding of the security
environment, Canada places importance on its own
national land and the North American region on the
basis of the national defense policy. Based on the
idea that global security has a direct connection with
Canadian defense, Canada positions active international
contribution as a basis of the national defense policy.
In terms of the building-up of defense capability, the
Canadian defense policy focuses on the fields of space
and cyberspace and intelligence. It also stated plans to
increase the national defense budget, which once declined
in the 2010s, by more than 70% in 10 years, and the
Regular Force by 3,500 (to 71,500) military personnel.
Furthermore, Canada released the Arctic and Northern
Policy Framework in September 2019, indicating a
policy to enhance Canada’s military presence in the
region, based on the recognition that strategic, military,
and economic importance of the region is increasing.
Canada regards the United States as its most important
ally and conducts air defense, space defense, and
maritime patrolling and monitoring activities in North
America jointly with the United States through the North
American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD).
As a founding member, Canada also places importance
on its relationship with NATO, and has been actively
participating in NATO-led operations. In addition, as
a member of the Five Eyes (FVEY), an intelligencesharing alliance, Canada receives a great deal of benefits
and intends to continue deepening the relation with it.
Canada traditionally supports the activities of the United
Nations, and the Trudeau administration has expressed
its stance that contributing to the UN Peacekeeping
Operations (PKO) is of utmost importance.
Concerning its involvement in the Indo Pacific region


-----

in November 2022, Canada announced its first IndoPacific Strategy as a comprehensive road map to deepen
its engagement in the region over the next decade. In
the strategy, China is mentioned as an “increasingly
disruptive global power” and that it is looking to shape the
international order into a more permissive environment
for China’s interests and values. The strategy also
states that Canada will challenge China if it engages in
behavior that undermines Canada’s national interests or
those of its partners in the region. On the other hand,
Canada showed its intention to cooperate with China to
find solutions to global issues such as climate change.
In addition, Canada raised promoting peace, resiliency,
and security of the region as one of its strategic objectives,


and expanding and deepening security relationship
with allies and partners including Japan. Canada also
stated its intention to continue warning and surveillance
activities against illegal maritime activities including
illicit ship-to-ship transfer with North Korean vessels[5],
which started in April 2018. On the other hand, Canadian
warships have passed through the Taiwan Strait several
times since 2018 in accordance with international
laws,[6] and Canada has stated that it would strengthen its
naval presence in the Indo-Pacific region, including by
increasing the number of frigates deployed to the region.
Attention will be focused on Canada’s involvement in
the region in the future.

**(2) Maritime Security in the Gulf Region**

Since May 2019, events affecting the navigation safety
of civilian vessels have occurred sporadically in the
waters of the Middle East. With regard to Japan-related
vessels, in June 2019, two vessels, including the chemical
tanker Kokuka Courageous operated by a Japanese
shipping company, were attacked in the Gulf of Oman.
While the United States and others have pointed out that
the attack was committed by Iran, Iran has denied any
involvement. Based on a comprehensive review of the
information from related countries, technical analysis of
the damage to the vessel, and testimony from the parties
concerned, Japan believes that the damage to the vessel
is highly likely to have been caused by limpet mines.[2]

In addition to above, as major incidents of attack
against civilian vessels, a Japanese company-owned ship
operated and administrated by a British company chaired
by an Israeli businessman was attacked in July 2021 off
the coast of Oman, and in November 2022 an Israeliowned vessel operated by a Singaporean company was
also attacked. U.S. Central Command announced that
Iranian-made unmanned aerial vehicles were used in
both these attacks.

**Peace**


**Part**
**Ⅰ**

**Chapter**


As the Middle East peace process is in a stalemate, in
Palestine, the moderate Fatah, which governs the West
Bank, and the Islamic fundamentalist Hamas, which
effectively controls the Gaza Strip, are in conflict,
splitting the area.
In such circumstances, after then U.S. Trump
administration announced its recognition of Jerusalem as
the capital of Israel in 2017 and moved the U.S. embassy
from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2018, the tensions have
risen, particularly in the Gaza Strip. In 2020, the
administration announced a new Middle East peace plan,
but the Palestinian side refused to negotiate, opposing
the plan’s descriptions concerning the Israeli-Palestinian
border and the possession of Jerusalem.
On the other hand, the Trump Administration actively
encouraged Israel and Arab countries to achieve peace
agreements. In and after August 2020, the United
Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco
successively reached agreements for the normalization
of diplomatic relations with Israel. The establishment of
diplomatic relations between Arab countries and Israel
was the first such event since that with Egypt (1979) and
Jordan (1994).
In March 2022, the foreign ministers of Israel, Bahrain,
Egypt, Morocco, UAE, and the United States gathered in
Israel for a meeting. A document including contents that

were fired into Israel from the Gaza Strip, leading to an
exchange of fire with the Israel Defense Forces, which
fired back. Although a ceasefire was announced within
the same month, tension between both sides continues.
Amid the changing situations surrounding the Middle

There has been no concrete progress in peace
negotiations and political processes up to the present amid
continuing conflicts. Further efforts by the international
community are needed to realize the stabilization of
Syria.

**5 Situation in Yemen**


**Part**
**Ⅰ**

**Chapter**


In Yemen, following anti-government protests that
occurred from February 2011 and international pressure
afterward, then President Ali Abdullah Saleh agreed to
resign. Through the election held in February 2012, then
Vice President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi was elected as
the new president.
Meanwhile, the confrontation intensified between the
government and the opposition insurgent group Houthis,
based in northern Yemen. As the Houthis invaded
the Yemeni capital of Sana’a and other locations, the
President requested support from Arab countries. In
response, in March 2015, coalition forces led by Saudi
Arabia began air strikes against the Houthis. In response,
the Houthis also launched attacks on the mainland
of Saudi Arabia with ballistic missiles, UAVs, cruise
missiles, and other weapons.
In December 2018, a cease-fire in Hodeidah city, host
to the biggest port in Yemen, was agreed upon between
the Houthis and the Yemen government. However, the
cease-fire was implemented to only a limited degree.
In November 2019, the Yemeni Government and the
Southern Transitional Council (STC), a separatist group
in southern Yemen, signed the Riyadh Agreement in the
capital of Saudi Arabia, Riyadh. Then, the new cabinet
was established in December 2020. President Hadi newly
established the “Presidential Leadership Council,” and
announced that he would transfer all of his authority in
April 2022. The council comprises delegates of all the
political powers in Yemen, except the Houthis, and aims
to strengthen the governance of the government and
conclude the negotiation with the Houthis.
In the same month, the UN Secretary-General’s
Special Envoy for Yemen announced that the parties
to the armed conflict agreed on a two-month ceasefire
throughout Yemen. Although it was announced that the
ceasefire agreement had not been renewed in October


In Syria, violent conflicts among Syrian Government
forces, opposition forces, and other organizations have
been continuing since March 2011. Conflicts between
the government forces supported by Russia and Iran
and opposition forces supported by Turkey and others
occur intermittently even today. Although it is pointed
out that Russia has been redeploying some of the troops
stationed in Syria to Ukraine since the beginning of
Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, it seems that
Syrian Government forces have power over the most
of the country, and the situation is advantageous to the
Assad administration as a whole. In these circumstances,
a trend is observed in which the Syrian government,
and Arab countries and Turkey that have supported the
opposition, attempt to improve diplomatic relations.
Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) which had
become powerful in Iraq and Syria since 2014, lost its
base in Syria in 2019 as the anti-ISIL operation by U.S.led coalition forces had been progressing since 2015.
Since then, the U.S. Forces have been continuously
stationed in northeastern Syria as part of efforts to
prevent ISIL regaining power.
According to an estimate by the Office of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights
(OHCHR) in June 2022, more than 300,000 citizens died
in a series of collisions from March 2011 to March 2021
in the situation in Syria. Furthermore, the earthquake
that occurred in southeastern Turkey in February 2023
also caused significant damage in Syria There were

after it was first renewed in June and August of the same
year, large-scale armed conflicts, aerial bombings by
coalition forces, and cross-border attacks by the Houthis

the parties to the armed conflict to renew the ceasefire
are still continuing, but the prospect of the conclusion of
a final peace accord remains elusive.

In February 2020, an agreement was signed between
the United States and the Taliban that included the
conditional phase-out of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. In
March 2020, the United States announced that it had
begun the withdrawal of its forces. Moreover, peace
negotiations began between the Afghan Government and
the Taliban, in Qatar, in September 2020. U.S. Forces
completed the withdrawal by the end of August 2021.
In this situation, the Taliban expanded their ruled area
quickly and in August 2021, they brought the capital
city Kabul under their control. In September 2021, they
announced the establishment of a caretaker cabinet. The
Taliban has attained no approval as a government from
other nations as of March 2023.

to February 2025. Attention will be focused on future
trends.
Armed conflict between the Ethiopian federal
government and Tigray People’s Liberation Front
(TPLF) occurred in Ethiopia in November 2020. While
the confrontation grew violent and a state of emergency

was lifted in February 2022 and a peace agreement was
concluded in November 2022. Attention will be focused
on the implementation status of the peace agreement
towards stable security.

challenges such as armed conflicts, terrorism, and piracy.
In Sudan, the national army clashed with the Rapid

Russia has been actively exporting weapons to
African countries.[6] In addition to this, the activity of
private military companies (PMCs) has been prominent
in recent years. Among them, Wagner is said to have
dispatched mercenaries to Libya, Central Africa, Mali,
and other countries.[7]

In addition, China and Russia are strengthening
cooperation with South Africa. For example, the two
countries conducted joint military exercises with South
Africa in November 2019 and February 2023.

**(2) The United States and Europe**
The U.S. have had military cooperation with
African countries through the U.S. Africa Command
(AFRICOM)’s joint exercises.[8] The commander of
AFRICOM sounded an alert, indicating that China’s
economic and military presence poses a challenges for
both African nations and American interests and that
Russia is expanding its African operations, including
via the private military company Wagner and they
will bring destabilization, democratic backsliding, and
human rights abuses to Africa.[9] The United States has
demonstrated its intention to build up its partnership with
African countries through efforts to enhance the peace
and security of Africa in the National Security Strategy
(NSS) published in October 2022. It is expected that the
United States will continue to be involved in Africa.
Europe also is said to have shown its presence in
the form of stationed troops, training mission, and
dispatching personnel to counter terrorism operations
for some time. However, European troops have tended
to withdraw from Mali, against a backdrop of inside
rebellion in the Mali government and its approach to
Wagner since June 2021.

In terms of security, African countries have long had deep

While China has enjoyed economic profit in Africa
since the 2000s, military involvement has also been
increasing in recent years. In August 2017, China began
to operate a “support base” for logistics support of the
PLA in Djibouti, and it is pointed out that a large landing
ship called at the “support base” in March and August
2022. Furthermore, it is pointed out that China may be
considering the establishment of PLA logistics facilities
in some countries including Kenya and Equatorial
Guinea.[4] Considering these trends, the U.S. Government
points out that China sees Africa “as an important arena
to challenge the rules-based international order and

The U.S. Forces conduct exercises for the purpose of dealing with extremist organizations and enhancing maritime law enforcement capabilities. For example, the exercise “Flintlock” has been held
in the Sahel region annually since 2005 for the purpose of dealing with extremist organizations. In March 2023, the exercise was held in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire, and over 1,300 military personnel
from 29 countries participated in it.

**Trends in International Terrorism**
**3**

**1 General Situation**


Central Africa Province, based mainly in Mozambique,
lead to the suspension of the development of a natural
gas field led by a French company in March 2021. In
eastern Africa, Al-Shabaab continuously hinders political
processes in Somalia.
European and other countries have been providing
counter-terrorism operations and are supporting trainings
against such terrorist organizations’ activities. For
example, in June 2022, France, which has dispatched
troops since 2013, finished the operations of French-led
multinational special forces which had been conducted
in the Sahel region since 2020. Also, France completed
the withdrawal of French troops from Mali in August
2022, and announced the termination of military
operations in the Sahel region in November 2022. In
Mozambique, in August 2021, units dispatched from
neighboring countries contributed to the recapture of
the area occupied by armed groups, and an EU training
mission began operations in November 2021.

**3 Trends in of Activities in the Middle East**


There are prominent cases where power vacuums in
some countries with weak governance in the Middle
East and Africa have become a hotbed for activities
of international terrorist organizations such as Al
Qaeda and ISIL. This kind of terrorist organizations
have instigated fighters to conduct terrorist attacks at
their home and abroad, and are also spreading violent
extremist ideologies via Internet or other means. This
kind of terrorist organizations have instigated fighters
to conduct terrorist attacks at their home and abroad,
and are also spreading violent extremism via Internet or
other means. As a result, terrorist attacks planned and
committed by individuals or groups who have no official
relations with international terrorist organizations but
have become influenced by them in some ways, have
occurred in Western and other countries. Moreover,
terrorist attacks targeting certain religions or races in a
right-wing extremist political context have also occurred
in Western countries.
Among international terrorist organizations, ISIL
established multiple “provinces” outside of their original
base in Iraq and Syria as “Islamic State” territories, and
these “provinces” have been conducting terrorist acts in
various places.
As for Al Qaeda, based primarily in Afghanistan, it is
believed to have been weakened, as many of the group’s
senior members were killed through U.S. operations.
However, they continue some actions such as issuing
statements.
Concerning international counterterrorism measures,
international cooperation has grown even more important
as terrorism threats have diffused and deepened on the
diversification of terrorist attacks and the improvement
of terrorist groups’ attack capabilities.

**2 Trends of Activities in Africa**


**Part**
**Ⅰ**

**Chapter**


Since 2013, ISIL had become powerful by taking
advantage of the unstable situation in Iraq and Syria, and
unilaterally declared the establishment of the “Islamic
State” in 2014. From that year, the U.S. led Coalition
forces conducted airstrikes and education/training
missions for local groups in Iraq and Syria. In 2019, the
United States announced that it and the Coalition forces
had liberated 100 percent of ISIL-controlled areas in the
two countries. Although the United States announced the
death of ISIL’s leader in February and November 2022,
ISIL announced the appointment of a new leader in
March and November 2022 respectively and is believed
to still be active in Iraq and Syria.
In Afghanistan, while the Taliban are expanding their
controlled area, the ISIL Khorasan Province has been
continuously conducting terrorist attacks mainly in the
capital city of Kabul and eastern Afghanistan since 2015.
When the Taliban, having a cooperative relationship with
Al-Qaeda, took control of Kabul in August 2021, the
United States announced to continue counterterrorism
operations through over-the-horizon capabilities, despite
the completion of the U.S. Forces’ withdrawal.
Even after the withdrawal of U S Forces the ISIL


ISIL or Al Qaeda affiliated organizations are active in
Africa. For example, in some areas of West Africa such
as Mali and other parts of the Sahel region, conflicts
between terrorist organizations as well as vigorous
terrorist activities are observed. In Southern Africa, raids
by armed groups such as the one later known as the ISIL


-----

Khorosan Province is actively conducting terrorist
attacks in Kabul and other areas, although the number of
attacks is on the decline. The United States announced
in August 2022 that it has killed Al Qaeda’s leader with
a drone attack in Kabul, the capital city of Afghanistan.
Al-Qaeda has not announced the inauguration of the
successor as of March 2023.

**Trends of Military Cutting-edge Technology**
**2**


**(1) Hypersonic Weapons**
The United States, China, Russia, and others are
developing hypersonic weapons, including Hypersonic
Glide Vehicles (HGVs) that would be launched from
ballistic missiles, maneuvered to glide at hypersonic
speed (Mach 5 or above) in the atmosphere, and hit
targets, as well as Hypersonic Cruise Missiles (HCMs)
using scramjet engines and other technologies that
enable hypersonic flights. It is suggested that hypersonic
weapons would fly in lower orbits than conventional
ballistic missiles at hypersonic speed above Mach 5 for a
longer period of time and that their high maneuverability
would make them difficult to be detected and intercepted.
A senior official in the U.S. Department of Defense
(DoD) mentioned a development plan for hypersonic
weapons in February 2021, revealing that the United
States will deploy hypersonic weapons in the early to
mid-2020s and build defense capabilities in the mid
to late 2020s.[1] A prototype Long Range Hypersonic
Weapon (LRHW) was delivered to the U.S. Army in
October 2021, and training aimed at the completion of its
deployment in FY2023 is being conducted. In addition,
the U.S. Air Force announced the successful test launch
of an Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW)
in December 2022.
In China, the DF-17 ballistic missile, which is viewed
as having the capability to carry HGVs, made its first
public appearance during the military parade marking
the 70th anniversary of China’s founding in October
2019. The U.S. DoD has pointed out that China will have
operational DF-17 missiles by 2020. Moreover, it has
been pointed out that China launched an ICBM in July
2021, and the HGV it had carried flew over a distance of
just under 40,000 km over 100 minutes and did not strike
its target but came close.[2]

Russia deployed the HGV “Avangard” in 2019. During
the expanded executive meeting of the Defence Ministry
held in December 2022, Minister of Defence Shoigu
said that the new ICBM Sarmat, which is believed to

1 According to the website of the U.S. Department of Defense on February 27, 2021.


be capable of carrying Avangard, is scheduled to be
deployed in 2023. Furthermore, the Russian Ministry
of Defence announced that the test launch of the HCM
Zircon from a submarine was successfully completed in
October 2021, and a frigate armed with Zircon embarked
on combat patrol in January 2023.
North Korea also seems to have made the realization
of “hypersonic gliding warheads” one of its priority
issues and is conducting research and development
in this regard. It has been launching missiles it calls
“hypersonic missiles” since September 2021.
The United States carries out the development of
the interceptor missile for hypersonic missiles, and
signed a contract related to the development of missiles
to intercept hypersonic missiles in their glide phase in
November 2021.

**(2) High-power Energy Technology**
High-power energy weapons, such as railguns, highenergy laser weapons, and high-power microwave
weapons, are being developed as a means to counter
various airborne threats.
A railgun is a kind of weapon that shoot bullets using
a magnetic field generated from electrical energy. Unlike
missiles, the bullets used for railguns have no propulsion
device. For this reason, the bullets are smaller, cost less,
and require less space for storing. Therefore, railguns
are said to be capable of coping effectively with attacks
involving a large number of missiles.
The United States, China, Russia and others are
developing high-energy laser weapons to destroy
targets with laser energy. Laser weapons are a low-cost,
effective means of intercepting large numbers of small
unmanned vehicles and small vessels. Laser weapons are
expected to become a new missile defense system if their
power can be increased to the extent they are capable of
intercepting missiles.
The United States is developing several laser weapons.
In August 2022, the first tactical laser weapon system

delivered to the U.S. Navy.
China unveiled the 30-100 kW “Silent Hunter” laser
weapon system, which is capable of countering small
unmanned aircraft, at the international defense exhibition
IDEX 2017. There are also indications that China has
deployed anti-satellite laser weapons that appear to be
designed to interfere with or damage the optical sensors
of low-earth orbit satellites, and that it is developing
laser weapons with even higher power output.
Russia has deployed the 10 kW Peresvet laser weapon
system and it is reportedly developing a megawatt-class
chemical laser weapon system for attacking satellites.
Israel announced in June 2021 that it successfully
completed a series of tests to intercept more than one
unmanned aircraft by an airborne laser weapon in flight.
Israel also successfully completed a test to intercept
unmanned aircraft, mortar shells, and other objects by a
land vehicle mounted laser weapon in April 2022.
High power microwave weapons are weapons to
destroy or cause malfunction of electronic equipment in
UAVs, missiles, and such. The United States Air Force


made a prototype of Phaser high power microwave
weapon in 2019. The system reportedly countered two
to three small unmanned aircraft at one time and 33 in
total during an army exercise. In July 2021, the U.S. Air
Force Research Laboratory revealed that it signed the
development contract for new high-power microwave
weapon Mjolnir based on outcomes from the experiment
to counter swarm attacks by small unmanned aircraft
using technology demonstration system THOR.

**Trends of Cutting-edge Technology in the Civilian Field**
**3**


**(1) Artificial Intelligence (AI) Technology**
AI technology is one of the technological areas that
shows rapid progress in recent years. It has been pointed
out that the rapid AI progress has been exerting a great
impact on the military field, including the application
for unmanned vehicles and the cyber domain as well
as supporting for command and decision-making and
improving data processing capacity, among other areas.
As an application of AI, the United States conducted
demonstration tests on the Advanced Battle Management
System (ABMS), in which AI analyzes collected
information and rapidly shares it via networks with
combat units and others, in December 2019. Meanwhile,
China has announced in July 2020 that an AI Military
Simulation Competition was held by the Central
Military Commission with the purpose of researching
and developing next-generation command information
systems.
Different nations are also developing unmanned
vehicles equipped with AI. The United States revealed


that the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency (DARPA) is developing various unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs), including swarm flights of small
UAVs for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
(ISR) missions that can be air-launched, recovered,
and reused, as well as unmanned surface vessels for
detecting submarines. Moreover, it promotes research
on conceptions related to the cooperation of manned
vehicles and unmanned vehicles such as research and
development for automated air-to-air battle and the
development of Skyborg system[3], which successfully
completed its second flight test in June 2021.
China revealed in May 2018 that the China Electronics
Technology Group Corporation has successfully
performed a swarm flight of 200 AI-equipped unmanned
vehicles, and in September 2020, a Chinese state-owned
munition company publicly released the status of the
UAV swarm test. It is assumed that military operations
including such swarm flights will be difficult to counter
with conventional air defense systems. A UAV CH-4

was exhibited for the first time at the China International
Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition held in November
2022.
In September 2019, Russia conducted a coordinated
flight test between S-70 heavy unmanned combat aerial
vehicle “Okhotnik,” stealth heavy unmanned combat
aerial vehicle, and the fifth-generation fighter Su-57,
and released the flight test footage publicly. There is
a reported possibility that around four Okhotniks may
accompany each double-seated Su-57 fighter to attack
targets in the air and on land.
Since it has also been pointed out that there is a
possibility for these unmanned vehicles to be developed
into Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS),
discussions within the framework of the Convention on
Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) are underway.
Furthermore, at the Responsible Artificial Intelligence
in the Military Domain (REAIM) summit held in
February 2023, REAIM Call to Action to affirm the
responsible military use of AI technology in accordance
with obligations of international law and in a manner that
does not compromise international security, stability,
and accountability was published with the support of 60
countries including Japan.

**(2) Quantum Technology**
Quantum technology is positioned as an important
technology which brings innovation to society by
applying quantum mechanics that differ from familiar
physics that people sense every day. In December
2019, quantum cryptography communication, quantum
sensors, and quantum computers were given as
examples of quantum technologies expected for military
application by the Defense Science Board, which is a
consultation body for the U.S. Department of Defense.
Many countries are researching quantum cryptography
communication which cannot be decoded by third
parties. China has developed the world’s longest quantum
cryptographic communications network, extending over
approximately 3,000 km and connecting Beijing and
Shanghai. In addition, in August 2016, China launched
“Mozi,” the world’s first satellite to test quantum
cryptographic communications. In January 2018, China
said that it succeeded in using Mozi for long-distance
quantum cryptographic communication between China


and Austria.
It has been pointed out that in the future, quantum
sensors could be used for tracking missiles and aircraft,
as well as for more advanced gyros and accelerometers.[4]

Quantum computers are thought to be capable of
computing problems in a significantly shorter amount of
time and with less electricity consumption than existing
supercomputers, and are expected to be applied to areas
such as decryption. China stated in its 14th Five-Year
Plan announced in 2021 that it would accelerate the
development of advanced technologies such as quantum
computers and enhance joint development by the military
and private sectors in the field of quantum technology.
On the other hand, post-quantum cryptography which
cannot be solved by quantum computers is being
researched in many countries.

**(3) Cutting-Edge Information and Communication**
**Technology**

The fifth generation wireless mobile network system
(5G) has been gaining traction since commercial services
were launched in countries one after another in April
2019 as a mobile communications infrastructure.
In March 2020, the United States announced the
National Strategy to Secure 5G, and in May 2020, the
U.S. Department of Defense 5G Strategy was announced,
which lays out the defense policy approaches for the
National Strategy. The DoD’s strategy has indicated
5G as an extremely important strategic technology and
that countries with proficient knowledge in cuttingedge technology developed via this will gain economic
and military advantages. Furthermore, the DoD started
experiments following the completion of a 5G network
experimental facility in the Hill Air Force Base in Utah
in December 2021.
In addition, in February 2022, the DoD announced its
Technology Vision for an Era of Competition, and raised
FutureG, the next generation of wireless communication
technology and successor to 5G, as one of the critical
technology areas essential for maintaining national
security.

**Diffusion of Information-related Technology and Information Warfare**
**4[ 4]**


There is growing concern about information warfare,
such as the dissemination of disinformation and the
proliferation of information aimed at eroding trust in
the target government or dividing society using social
networking services (SNS) and such. It has been pointed
out that this was observed during the annexation of
Crimea by Russia in 2014, the alleged intervention by
Russia in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, China’s
activities surrounding the 2020 Taiwan presidential
election, and Russia’s aggression against Ukraine in
2022. It is also pointed out that autonomous programs
called bots are used a lot for this kind of SNS operation.
Major social media companies have announced that they
deleted accounts used for propaganda[5] operations by
governments such as China and Russia, including bot
accounts.
Information warfare by dissemination of
disinformation like these may become stronger when
done in conjunction with more effective use of AI and
computing technologies. For this, the 2021 National
Defense Authorization Act requires the U.S. Secretary of
Homeland Security to issue a report about technologies
used to imitate digital contents and their effect on security
if used by foreign states. The U.S. Defense Advanced


Research Projects Agency (DARPA) conducts research
on algorithms to automatically detect imitated contents,
focusing on consistency of images and sounds. Ukraine
has taken various countermeasures against Russian
disinformation in response to Russia’s aggression, such as
disseminating its military achievements and the military
situation through government websites and various
social media platforms, conveying messages of Russian
prisoners of war to their mothers, and encouraging
to report of accounts spreading disinformation as
inappropriate content, and so on. Through these
well-tuned information transmission strategies, it is
succeeding in shaping internal and external public
opinions regarding Ukraine as a humanitarian country
and Russia as inhumane country.


**KEY WORDS**

**Information Warfare**

Information warfare refers to attempts to create a favorable security
environment by influencing the public opinion and decision-making of other
countries through disinformation and strategic communications, etc., and
minimizing the impact to one’s own decision-making, even when conflict
has yet to arise. Emphasis is being placed on such information warfare in
the international community.



**Trends Concerning Defense Production and Technology Bases**
**5**


the nearly 16 trillion yen invested in the government
research expenditure of the United States is paid out by
the DoD.
The United States also offers large-scale funds to
research conducted by companies and universities. For
example, DARPA, an internal organization of the DoD,
has requested a budget of US$4,388 million for FY2024
to continue active investments in innovative research at
companies and universities, with the aim of maintaining
the U.S. Forces’ technological superiority. In addition,
the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) mediates between


Advanced technologies based on significant technological
advances in the civilian field have so much power that
they can completely change the way battles happen.
Relative merits in industry and technology greatly
influence national security. Under these circumstances,
many countries are taking on a variety of initiatives in
order to maintain and enhance their national defense
production and technology bases.
First of all, each country enhances investments
to defense research and development to ensure
technological superiority. For example, about half of

to make the most of cutting-edge technologies from
the civilian field in the resolution of challenges in the
security sector. The DIU has produced contracts with
over 350 companies mainly in six fields, including AI,
autonomous technology, and the cyber field. In FY2022,
the DIU moved seventeen consumer solutions suggested
by companies from the prototype stage to the production
stage.
China is promoting Civil-Military Fusion (CMF) as a
national strategy. General Secretary Xi Jinping stated in
his report to the 20th Congress of the Chinese Communist
Party (CCP) in October 2022 that China would build up
a series of new growth engines such as next-generation
information technologies, artificial intelligence (AI),
biotechnology, new energy, new materials, and such
through promoting integrated development of strategic
emerging industries, and clustered development.
In response to the recent utilizations of dual-use
technologies in defense equipment development, the
governments of the United Kingdom and Australia
provide funding to innovative research and development
of private sectors in order to acquire advanced civilian
technologies.[6]

Furthermore, foreign countries recognize the defense
industrial base as an essential element of their national
defense and have organized systems to implement their
policies through the publication of policy documents
and the establishment of organizations in charge of the
defense industry. They also take on a variety of initiatives
to maintain and strengthen their defense production
base, such as supporting the participation of domestic
companies in government programs and promoting
exports.
The United Kingdom published its Defence and
Security Industrial Strategy (DSIS) in order to construct
a more productive and strategic relationship with
domestic defense industries in 2021. The DSIS orders
the government to take on some initiatives such as largescale procurement reforms, toughening of supply chains,
and accelerating export permissions in order to strengthen
defense as a critical strategic asset. Furthermore, the
United Kingdom published the Defence Supply Chain
Strategy in 2022, and stated to aim to build up robust


defense supply chains to enable the military to respond
to the current severe security environment.
Australia created a new office of Minister for
Defence Industry in 2016, and announced the Defence
Industry Policy Statement in which projects to drive
the partnership between the Department of Defence
and defense industries were laid down. Australia
also supports small and medium sized enterprises
participating in the defense industry and keeps up with
financial support through the Office of Defence Industry
Support established in 2021 as a One-Stop organization
to support the defense industry.
The Republic of Korea (ROK) aims an improvement
of capabilities and higher self-containment of domestic
defense industry through their Defence Industry
Development Act and their Defence Science and
Technology Innovation Promotion Act enforced in
2021. Furthermore, the Defense Acquisition Program
Administration (DAPA) announced a policy to procure
equipment taking into consideration the ripple effects for
domestic industries, and a policy to promote cooperation
between foreign companies and domestic companies
as well as the use of domestic products by foreign
companies.[7]

Each country exports equipment strategically because
trading equipment strengthens the relationship between
the two trading countries as well as the base for defense
technology and the defense industry. For example, the

In the Defence and Security Industrial Strategy (DSIS) published in 2021, the United Kingdom announced that it will invest at least 6.6 billion pounds to defense research and development in four
years, and that it will increase investments to the Defence and Security Accelerator (DASA) that invests in industrial and academic innovations that are useful for national security. Australia invests
mainly in emerging technologies via the Next Generation Technologies Fund established in 2016.

United Kingdom announced in the DSIS that it would
support exporting with cross-ministerial effort from
different government offices such as the Department
for International Trade and the Home Office. The
United States, Russia, Europe, and China are still the

while Australia formulated its export strategy.[8] The


ROK established an export support organization, and
financially supports research and development for
export. Various countries proactively promote military
equipment export using a variety of measures.

**Trends Concerning Economic Security**
**6**


With science, technology, and innovation being the
focal points of competition between different nations,
attention is being paid to security initiatives in each
country focusing on the economic and technological
fields depending on changes in the conditions.
Each nation continuously deals with export control,
prescreening of inward investment, core infrastructure,
and so on in order to prevent leakage of their own
sensitive technologies. For example, China has been
putting the export control system in order, while trying
to develop and acquire cutting-edge technologies that
can be used in the military sector through Civil-Military
Fusion (CMF) policies. Specifically, China published the
Export Control Regulations for Dual-Use Items (Draft
for Public Comment) in April 2022. This regulation is
described as having been prepared in order to thoroughly
implement the Export Control Law (enforced in
December 2020) and for other purposes.[10]

The United States strategically and continuously
renews the investment screening system and export
control policies in order to protect core technologies.
The Executive Order on Ensuring Robust Consideration
of Evolving National Security Risks by the Committee
on Foreign Investment in the United States (EO14083)
was issued to the Committee on Foreign Investment
in the United States (CFIUS) in September 2022. The
fact that there are some nations that utilize investments
into the United States in order to violate security of the
United States is recognized in this executive order.
In October 2022, the United States issued measures


for export control in order to limit China’s capabilities

Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security,
revealed that the United States is making approaches to
allies and partners. In response to this, China referred the
export control of the United States for chips and other
products to the dispute settlement mechanism of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 2022.[11]

Canada announced its plan to adopt measures such as
prohibition of the use of new 5G devices and services
of Huawei and ZTE in May 2022, and submitted the
cybersecurity bill including the provisions for the
grounds for those measures to the House of Commons in
June 2022. In October 2022, influenced by U.S. sanctions
in 2020,[12] the United Kingdom designated Huawei as a
high-risk vender of devices and services for 5G networks
and prohibited immediately thirty-five companies from
installing new Huawei devices in 5G networks, pointing
out that the quality of Huawei products and services are
heightening the risks of hostile theft and system failure.
In addition, some countries continue to take required
measures for their own supply chains in order to
contribute to the stable supply of resources, and some
movement for international cooperation is also observed.

United Kingdom, France, and other countries, including
Japan, issued the same declaration. The DoD also stated
in the 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS) issued in
October 2022 that the capabilities of surveillance and
decision systems to achieve combat objectives despite
adversaries means of interference and deception will be
improved.
Among U.S. government organizations, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) under
direct control by the President is responsible mainly
for non-military space development, while the DoD
undertakes research, development, and operation of
military observation and reconnaissance satellites. In
August 2019, the United States inaugurated the U.S.
Space Command as a new geographic unified combatant
command based on the Strategic Command’s component
in charge of space missions. In December 2019,
the United States created the Space Force under the
Department of the Air Force as the sixth military branch,
with approximately 16,000 personnel. Furthermore,
in November 2022, the United States established a
“Combined Joint Task Force-Space Operations” under
the Space Command in order to coordinate operations
related to space. Space units were established under the
U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, and in December 2022,
under the U.S. Central Command respectively.

See Chapter 3, Section 1-2 (Military Posture)

**2 China**


**1 The United States**

The United States is the world greatest space power
that has been promoting a variety of space activities in
military, science, resource mapping, and other domains.
The launch of the first reconnaissance satellite in the
world and the first landing on the Moon are also among
its great achievements. The U.S. Forces clearly recognize
the importance of space for their actions, and on this
point, actively utilize space for security purposes.
On the policy front, the United States released its
National Space Strategy in March 2018, demonstrating
its recognition that its adversaries had turned space into
a warfighting domain and vowing to deter and defeat
threats in the space domain to protect the national
interests of the United States and its allies. Additionally,
the DoD appraises China and Russia as the most serious
and eminent threats in their Defense Space Strategy
(DSS). It also establishes the three targets of (1) build a
comprehensive military advantage in space; (2) integrate
military space power into national, joint, and combined
operations; and (3) secure a stable space domain.
Furthermore, the United States government says it will
continue to use space for national security activities under
the principles of the peaceful use of space found in the
National Space Policy (NSP) announced in December
2020.
In April 2022, the United States issued a voluntary
moratorium on destructive DA-ASAT missile tests and
requested other countries to adopt similar initiatives.
In response to this, the Republic of Korea (ROK), the

China has been promoting space development since the
1950s, and among other achievements, was the first in
the world to successfully land an unmanned probe on
the far side of the Moon. China is further intensifying
space activities. For example, in October 2022, China
launched the laboratory cabin module Mengtian and got
it docked with the core module Tianhe, completing the
space station Tiangong.
While traditionally emphasizing international
cooperation and the peaceful use of space, it is pointed out
that China proactively used space for military purposes,
including information collection, communications, and
positioning through satellites. For example, it has been
pointed out that the Beidou satellite positioning system
can be used for missile guidance as well as the navigation

of aircraft and ships, while the Yaogan system launched
several times in 2021 and 2022 can be used for electronic
and image reconnaissance. Both systems are said to
have the potential for military applications. Moreover,
a Chinese state-owned corporation that develops and
manufactures transport rockets such as the Changzheng
series also reportedly develops and produces ballistic
missiles, so it is likely that the technology for transport
rockets can be applied to ballistic missiles.
It is pointed out that China recognizes counter space
operations as a means to deter and confront the United
States’s intervention to regional conflicts[2] and carries
out ASAT development and the like. In addition to the
satellite destruction test in 2007 mentioned above and
the “non-destructive” test of an anti-satellite missile in
July 2014, it is also pointed out that China continues
to acquire and develop various ASAT capabilities and
related technologies such as ground-based lasers and
space robots.[3]

China is thus expected to focus on space development
through close cooperation between government, military,
and private sectors. The United States estimates that
China pursues space capabilities the same as or higher
than those of the United States.[4] It is also pointed out that
the number of Chinese military satellites under operation
is larger than that of the United States.[5]

In terms of policy, China insists that space is key to
international strategic competition, and that the safety
of space is a strategic safeguard for nation building and
social development. It also reveals the principle that it
accelerates development of the aerospace domain. In
the white paper titled “China’s Space Program: A 2021
Perspective” issued in January 2022, it was emphasized
to “build China into a space power” and it stated that
China promotes the space industry. Moreover, the policy
to “accelerate the construction of space development
power” was raised in General Secretary Xi Jinping’s
report to the 20th Congress of the CCP in October 2022.
The Strategic Support Force, established in December
2015 as a force under direct control by the Central
Military Commission, is considered to be in charge of
space, cyber, and electronic warfare missions, including
the launching and tracking of satellites, although the
details of its missions and organization have not been


published. The Equipment Development Department
of the Central Military Commission is believed to be in
charge of crewed space programs.

**3 Russia**


While Russian space activity has been reduced since
the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia has
continued to be active in space in recent years, even after
its aggression against Ukraine. For example, Russia is
working on the multi-satellite constellation plan Sfera
to complete a constellation of over 600 satellites for
observation and communication by 2030. Furthermore,
Russia has decided to extend its participation in the
International Space Station until 2028 and has revealed a
development plan for its own space station.
Meanwhile, Russia has used its space capabilities
for military operations in Syria. Russian Minister of
Defense Shoigu revealed at a meeting of the Ministry of
Defence in 2019 that he has become aware of the need
to rebuild the country’s military satellites based on this
tactical experience. Russia launched military satellites
that may be for electronic reconnaissance in April and
December 2022. Russian missile defense capability is
continuously being strengthened. For example, its sixth
early warning satellite Tundra was successfully put into
orbit in November 2022. In addition, in November 2021,
the Russian Ministry of Defence announced that it had
successfully destroyed a Soviet satellite in orbit in an
experiment.
On the other hand, the director general of the State
Space Corporation ROSCOSMOS stated that the agency
completely stopped the cooperation with the European
Space Agency because of the influence of Western
countries’ sanctions.
In regard to Russian policies, in March 2016, Russia
released the Federal Space Program for 2016-2025 as a
specific future guideline for space activities, including
the development and deployment of domestic space
satellites and crewed flight programs.
From an organizational perspective, ROSCOSMOS is
in charge of space activities related to Russia’s scientific
and economic areas, while the Russian Ministry of
Defence is involved in space activities for security

The ROK’s space development is promoted based
on the Fourth Basic Space Development Promotion
Plan announced in December 2022 under the Space
Development Promotion Act implemented in 2005. The
ROK stated in this plan that it will double its spacerelated budget, promote the space industry, and establish
an aerospace agency by the end of 2023, with the goal
of landing on the Moon and Mars by 2045. Furthermore,
the ROK is accelerating aerospace development, aiming
to have on its own launch means, after the U.S. lifted
restrictions on South Korea’s ability to develop missiles
under an agreement about missiles reached by the two
countries in May 2021. For example, the ROK launched
a domestically produced rocket called Nuri for the
second time and successfully put the satellite into orbit
for the first time in June 2022, and is also planning four
other launches by 2027.
Among organizations, the Korea Aerospace Research
Institute leads research and development as an
implementation agency. Furthermore, the Korea Agency
for Defense Development is engaged in the development
and use of various satellites. Also, to secure space
surveillance capabilities above the Korean Peninsula,
the country created its first space force in 2019, and
reinforced and reorganized the unit into the Air Force
Space Operation Battalion in 2022.
In addition, the ROK’s Ministry of National Defense
says it plans to secure surveillance, reconnaissance, and
early warning satellites in order to strengthen space
related capabilities.[6]

**5 India**


Regarding European space activities, the European
Union (EU), the European Space Agency (ESA), and
European countries are promoting their own unique
space activities and are cooperating with each other to
implement space activities.
The EU allocated 14.88 billion euros to its space
policy in its medium-term budget plan from 2021 through
2027, and in May 2021, established the European Union
Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA), which will
be responsible for the execution of EU space programs,
including the safety management of satellite positioning
systems. A satellite positioning system called “Galileo”
and an earth observation program named “Copernicus”
under planning by the EU and ESA, and a reconnaissance
satellite project called “Multinational Space-based
Imaging System (MUSIS)” of the European Defense
Agency (EDA) are expected to be utilized for the
security field in Europe. Furthermore, the EU stated in
the EU Space Strategy for Security and Defence issued
in March 2023 that it would enhance the use of space
capabilities in security and defense domains, and plans
the development of a new earth observation service and
the delivery of early SDA services.
Also, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
declared that space was the “fifth tactical domain” next
to land, sea, air and cyberspace. This shows NATO’s
awareness concerning the importance of security in the
space domain. In October 2020, the NATO Defense
Ministers Meeting was held, during which an agreement
was reached to establish a new space center. Furthermore,


India has promoted programs to develop manned space
missions, communications, positioning, observation, etc.
The United States and India emphasized the importance
of cooperation in space, and welcomed the plan to

in the Communiqué issued at the June 2021 NATO
Summit, it was stated for the first time that an armed
attack in space could lead to the invocation of NATO’s
right of collective self-defense. In addition, NATO stated
in the New Strategic Concept issued June 2022 that it
would enhance the capability for effective activity in
space and cyberspace domains.
The United Kingdom, which exited the EU at the end
of 2020, announced in January 2021 that it would not
participate in the Galileo Program. Moreover, the Space
Command was formally established in April 2021, and
reportedly bears three functionalities, namely: space
operations; training and education for space related
personnel; and space capability (development and
service of space equipment plan). In regard to strategy,
it announced to invest 1.4 billion pounds to some fields
including ISR and satellite communication in the next

September 2021 and Defence Space Strategy published
in February 2022.
France made reference to the creation of a space
command and the enhancement of threat identification
and space situation surveillance capabilities in the Space
Defence Strategy released in July 2019. In September
2019, France created the space command under the
Air Force to integrate functions and personnel of a
military space surveillance operation center, a joint
space command and a military satellite surveillance
center within the Armed Forces Ministry. Also, in
September 2020, the country changed the name of the
Air Force to the Air and Space Force, adding activities
for guaranteeing freedom of behavior in space and free
access to space within the operations of the Air Force.

China is suspected of conducting cyber attacks and
other activities to steal confidential information even in
peacetime.[3] Its involvement in the following incidents
has been pointed out in recent years.

-  In July 2021, the United States revealed that the cyber
attack detected in March 2021 aiming a vulnerability
of Microsoft Corporation’s mail server software was
conducted by a responsible organization related to the
Ministry of National Security of the People’s Republic of
China. The allied countries of the United States, including
Japan, condemned China all together on the same day.

-  A U.S. security company pointed out that APT41, which
is said to be supported by the Chinese government,
invaded the networks of some U.S. state governments
in 2021 through 2022.

-  In June 2022, the U.S. National Security Agency
(NSA), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency (CISA), and Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory to
provide information on ways in which People’s
Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored cyber actors,
since 2020, have continued to exploit vulnerabilities
associated with network devices in order to target a
variety of public and private sector organizations, and
on applying mitigations.

-  In July 2022, the Belgian government accused Chinese
state-sponsored hackers, including APT27, APT30,
APT31, and others, of conducting malicious cyber
activities against its interior and defense ministries.

-  In August 2022, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of
Taiwan announced that the IP addresses used in a

out that their main targets are the ROK, the United
States, and Japan.[4] Moreover, it is pointed out that their
personnel are trained by these agencies.[5] This is led by
the RGB of Korean People’s Army, and has intensively
built up cyber units, operating some 6,800 people.[6]

It also is said that North Korea, which is under
sanctions of every kind, uses cyber attacks to acquire
foreign currency taking advantage of loopholes of
sanctions.[7] It also commits thefts of foreign military
secret intelligence, and develops attack capabilities for
the critical infrastructure of other countries. The United
Nations Security Council Expert Panel 2022 Final
Report issued in April 2023 noted that North Korea’s
cyber attack methods have become more sophisticated,
leading to an amount between US$630 million and US$1
billion worth of cryptocurrencies stolen in 2022 alone.
It is pointed out that North Korea has been involved in
following cases in recent years.

-  In February 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice
prosecuted three North Koreans working under the
North Korean Reconnaissance General Bureau on
suspicion of involvement in a cyber attack.

-  Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI)
revealed in May 2021 that the North Korean cyber
group invaded the internal network of KAERI making
a bad use of a VPN server’s vulnerability.

-  In April 2022, the U.S. Treasury Department announced
that thefts of cryptocurrency worth US$600 million
in a popular online game were committed by a cyber
actor called the Lazarus Group, which is allegedly
sponsored by North Korea’s Reconnaissance General
Bureau.

-  In July 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice announced
that it seized approximately US$500,000 from a
North Korean state-sponsored cyber actor deploying
ransomware “Maui,” including the ransom paid by a
health care provider in Kansas in May 2021.

-  In January 2023, the U.S. FBI revealed that the culprit
of the theft of cryptocurrencies worth US$100 million
that occurred in June 2022 was the Lazarus Group,
and that US$60 million worth of it was laundered into
other cryptocurrencies.

-  In April 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice
announced a court-authorized operation to disable a
computer network that was under the command and
remote control of the Main Intelligence Directorate of
the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces through
the use of malware.

**4 Trends Concerning Other Threats**


**3 Russia**

It is pointed out that in the case of Russia, the Main
Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the
Russian Armed Forces, the Federal Security Service, and
the Foreign Intelligence Service are involved in cyber
attacks, and it has become clear that Russia’s armed
forces have a cyber command unit.[8] The cyber command
unit is believed to be responsible for conducting
offensive cyber activities, including inserting malware
into command and control systems of adversaries,[9] and
is said to have approximately 1,000 personnel.
Moreover, Russia revealed, in its National Security
Strategy released in July 2021, its perception that space
and information space are under active development as a
new domain for military action, and declared to reinforce
its sovereignty in the information space as a national
priority. In November 2019, the so called Sovereign
Internet Law went into effect to ensure Russian network’s
continuity. The law stipulates that the internet would be
cut out from the global network in the event of a cyber
attack or other circumstances.
The United States recognizes that Russia is refining
its spy activities, influence exercise behavior, and attack
capabilities, and that it will continue to be the greatest
threat in the cyberspace.[10] It is pointed out that Russia
has been involved in following cases in recent years.

-  In April 2021, the U.S. Government sanctioned 32
entities and individuals who carried out attempts led
by the Russian Government to influence the 2020 U.S.
presidential election, and other disinformation and
interference.

-  The Security Service of Ukraine revealed in November
2021 that, since 2014, cyber groups affiliated with
Russia’s Federal Security Service have conducted
cyber attacks on Ukraine’s public institutions and
critical infrastructure with the intention of seizing
control of such infrastructure, conducted intelligence
activities and influencing operations, and disrupted
Ukraine’s information systems.

-  In February 2022, the governments of the United
States, the United Kingdom, and Australia pointed out
that the cyber attacks on Ukraine financial institutions
were conducted by the Main Intelligence Directorate

Supply chain risks, including products embedded with
deliberately and fraudulently altered programs, and
the existence of advanced malware designed to attack
industrial control systems are also pointed out.
The U.S. Congress in August 2018 passed the
National Defense Authorization Act of 2019 including
provisions prohibiting government agencies from using
products of major Chinese communications equipment
manufacturers, such as Huawei. The United States
has provided its allies with information about risks
accompanying Chinese communications equipment
and urged them not to use such equipment. In response,
Australia has banned China’s Huawei and ZTE from
taking part in its fifth-generation mobile communications
system development project, while the United Kingdom
has announced its policy to remove all Huawei products
from its fifth-generation mobile communications system
network by the end of 2027.
In addition, in July 2022, a U.S. IT company pointed
out that various online services facilitating crimes by
using billing forms needed for cyber attacks such as
distribution of ransomware are increasing, and the
economy around those services is continuously growing.
Furthermore, in December 2022, a U.S. health academic

policy.
The United States pointed out in the DoD Cyber
Strategy issued in September 2018 that the United
States is engaged in a long-term strategic competition
with China and Russia, and that China and Russia
have expanded that competition to include persistent
campaigns in and through cyberspace that pose longterm strategic risk to the United States as well as to its
allies and partners. Also, the government stated in the
National Security Strategy (NSS) issued in October 2022
that it would deal with hostile behavior in cyberspace
in an uncompromising manner in order to deter cyber
attacks, and stated in the National Defense Strategy
(NDS) issued in the same month that priority would be
placed on building up resiliency in the cyber domain,
and direct deterrence means would be the offensive
cyber activities.
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued
a zero trust strategy in January 2022 in order to strengthen
cybersecurity of federal government agencies, requiring
agencies to implement security measures according to
the zero trust[12] model. The Biden administration stated
in the National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) issued
in March 2023 that the security and prosperity of the
United States were threatened by China, Russia, Iran,
North Korea and others proactively carrying out cyber
attacks, and the administration would put its energy into
defense of critical infrastructure, and interrupting and
dismantling threat actors.
At the Japan-U.S. “2+2” Meeting in 2019, the two
countries agreed to strengthen cooperation in the field
of cyberspace, affirming that international law applies
in cyberspace and that a cyber attack could, in certain
circumstances, constitute an armed attack for the
purposes of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty.
The U.S. Forces include Cyber Command, which was
elevated to a unified combatant command in May 2018


Given these growing threats in cyberspace, various
initiatives are under way.
It is believed that the international community has
diverging views on fundamental matters related to
cyberspace, including how international law should be
applied. For instance, the United States, Europe, and
Japan have called for maintaining a free cyberspace,
while Russia, China, and most emerging countries
have sought to strengthen state control of cyberspace.
Against this backdrop, there has been a movement to
promote the rule of law in cyberspace in the international
community. For instance, discussions are being held
on the establishment of international rules within the
framework of global conferences on cyberspace.

In addition, new life styles including telework,
education using ICT, and web conference services
have been established all over the world as a result of
the response to COVID-19 since 2020. On the other
hand, new security measures are being considered in
many countries as it is pointed out that the “perimeter
security”[11] concept that has been a major premise for
traditional cybersecurity measures, has limits with the
development of the digital services mentioned above.

In the United States, the Department of Homeland
Security is responsible for protecting federal government
networks and critical infrastructure against cyber attacks,
and the Department’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency (CISA) works to protect the networks
of government agencies. In April 2022, the State
Department newly established the Bureau of Cyberspace
and Digital Policy that works to address issues such as

On the organizational front, cybersecurity capabilities
across the government have been centralized through the
establishment of the Australian Cyber Security Centre
(ACSC), which addresses major cybersecurity issues
related to government agencies and critical infrastructure.
In addition, Australia announced in November 2022 the
formation of a new Joint Standing Operation task force
aimed at disrupting and stopping criminal cyber attacks.
The Minister for Cyber Security stated that this task force
consisted of 100 personnel from the Australian Signals
Directorate and the Australian Federal Police and would
implement offensive cyber defense.
Moreover, the Australian Defence Force created
the Information Warfare Division under the Joint
Capabilities Group in July 2017 and established the
Defence Signals Intelligence and Cyber Command
(DSCC) under the division in January 2018. In October
2019, the Royal Australian Air Force offered to recruit
cyber skills officers to protect networks, data and

At the NATO Summit in September 2014, an agreement
was reached that NATO’s collective defense applies to
cyber attacks against member states.
On the organizational front, in November 2017, an
agreement was reached on the creation of a new Cyber
Operations Center and the integration of NATO member
countries’ cyber defense capabilities into NATO missions
and operations. The Cyber Operations Center located in
Belgium is expected to be fully operational with cyber

China conducts force-on-force exercises on a routine
basis so that it can effectively accomplish missions
in complex electromagnetic environments, thereby
improving its practical capabilities. It is pointed out
that China’s armed forces have taken advantage of such
training to assess electronic warfare weapon research
and development achievements.[4] The Strategic Support
Force, established at the end of 2015 for improving
overall military operational capabilities, is said to be
responsible for such domains as electronic warfare,
cyber and space.
China’s Tu-154 information gathering and Y-8
electronic warfare aircraft have been seen flying around
the Nansei Islands and the Sea of Japan in the vicinity of
Japan. In addition, Y-9 electronic warfare aircraft flew
over the Pacific Ocean in April 2022. In the South China
Sea, China has allegedly deployed radio wave jamming
equipment on Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands.[5] In
January of the same year, a J-16D electronic warfare
aircraft entered the southwestern airspace of Taiwan.

**1 The United States and Europe**


The United States is committed to expanding electronic
warfare training and equipment and to enhancing
cooperation with its allies under an initiative to
aggressively achieve its dominance in the electromagnetic
spectrum. In addition, the Electromagnetic Spectrum
Superiority Strategy announced by the U.S. Department
of Defense in October 2020 recognizes the importance
of ensuring freedom of action in the electromagnetic
spectrum to the success of operations in all areas.
As an example of a military operation using electronic
warfare equipment, it is pointed out that the Light Marine
Air Defense Integrated System (LMADIS), an anti-UAV
jamming system with electronic attack capabilities, was
used to down an Iranian drone over the Strait of Hormuz
in July 2019.
The United States Army announced in September
2021 that a multidomain unit having space, cyberspace
and electronic warfare functions was deployed in
Germany. Also, the U.S. Air Force newly established the
350th Spectrum Warfare Wing in June 2021 to provide
operational, maintenance, and technical expertise in
electronic warfare for the Air Force.
Many other NATO member states are also developing
equipment for severe electronic warfare environments
and allegedly conducting electronic warfare-oriented
training with Russian forces’ electronic warfare
equipment in mind.[1] For example, NATO conducted
the electronic warfare exercise Dynamic Guard 22-2 in
November 2022 in order to enhance interoperability in
the electromagnetic spectrum with allies.

**(1) Maritime Security in the Middle East**
The Middle East has seen intermittent attacks on ships
in recent years.
For example, in the Strait of Hormuz and its vicinity,
attacks on private sector oil tankers have been seen since
May 2019. As high tensions including those over the
U.S.-Iran relations continue in the Middle East, U.S. and
French initiatives have been conducted to secure safe
navigation.

See Chapter 3, Section 10-1-2 (Situation in the Gulf Region)

See


**(2) Piracy**
Piracy seen at various locations has become a threat to
maritime traffic. The number of piracy / armed robbery at
sea incidents (hereinafter “piracy incidents”)[3] around the
world has declined in recent years after peaking at 445
incidents in 2010. (There were 115 incidents in 2022.)
The decline has depended heavily on the fall in the
number of piracy incidents in waters off the coast of
Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden. The number of piracy
incidents in waters off the coast of Somalia and in the
Gulf of Aden rose rapidly from 2008 to 2011 with 237
incidents, accounting for more than half of the total
number of piracy incidents worldwide and attracting
great international concern as a threat to safe navigation.
In recent years, however, the number of piracy incidents
in waters off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of
Aden has remained low as a result of various initiatives
taken by the international community, including Japan.
(There were no incidents in 2022. See Part III, Chapter
3, Section 2-2 (Counter-Piracy Operations) for Japan’s
initiatives.)
The international counter-piracy initiatives in waters
off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden include
counter-piracy operations by the Combined Task Group


151 (CTG151), a multinational force that was created by
the U.S. Force-led Combined Maritime Force (CMF)[4]
based in Bahrain. So far, the United States, Australia, the
United Kingdom, Turkey, the ROK, Pakistan and other
countries have participated in the CTG151, conducting
zone defense operations to counter piracy. The EU for its
part has conducted Operation Atalanta to counter piracy
since December 2008. In the operation, naval vessels
and aircraft dispatched by EU member countries escort
ships and monitor the waters off the coast of Somalia. It
has been decided that the operation will continue until
the end of 2024.
In addition, some countries have conducted their
exclusive operations outside the abovementioned
frameworks. Since December 2008, for example, China
has deployed naval vessels for counterpiracy operations
in waters off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of
Aden.
The number of piracy incidents in waters off the coast
of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden has remained low
as a result of these international initiatives. However,
the root causes resulting in piracy, such as Somalia’s
unstable internal security and poverty, have not yet been
resolved.
Meanwhile, in Africa, piracy incidents occurred in
the Gulf of Guinea (the number of incidents was 19
in 2022). The international community has continued
counter-piracy initiatives in this region.
The number of piracy incidents in Southeast Asian
waters came to 58 in 2022. In particular, piracy incidents
in the Singapore Strait have been increasing since 2019
and have reached one-third of all reported piracy cases in
the world in 2022; however, they are all minor incidents,
such as theft of fittings.

**Trends in the Arctic Ocean**
**3**

In recent years, moves towards the utilization of transArctic navigation routes and the development of natural
resources in the Arctic Ocean have gained momentum
in line with a decline in sea ice. The eight arctic circle
nations consisting of Canada, Denmark, Finland,
Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United
States established the Arctic Council in 1996 in order
to promote cooperation for common challenges such as
sustainable development and environment protection.[5]

From the perspective of security, the Arctic Ocean
has traditionally been used for the deployment of
strategic nuclear forces and as their transit route. With
the decrease in sea ice in recent years, ships have been
able to navigate for a longer period of time and more
extensively than before. It has therefore been considered
that the region could be used for deploying maritime
forces or maneuvering military forces using military
maritime transport capabilities in the future. In this
situation, moves to deploy new military capabilities in
the ocean are seen. In addition, Russia is promoting the
establishment of a system to defend its national interests
in the Arctic Region and has clearly stated in various
policy documents Russia’s rights in the Arctic Region
and the roles of the AFRF in defending these national
interests.
Russia has been developing natural gas on the Yamal
Peninsula and elsewhere. In 2018, liquefied natural gas
produced on the peninsula was transported to China for
the first time via an Arctic Ocean route. Also, on the
military front, Russia is deploying radar surveillance
networks, ground-to-air missiles, and surface-to-ship
missiles, as well as rebuilding airfields on the shoreline
of the Arctic Sea. Furthermore, in addition to the
development of such military facilities, the AFRF has
also been conducting such activities as strategic nuclear
deterrence patrols by SSBN and patrol flights by longrange bombers.


See


Chapter 3, Section 5-3-5 (Trends Related to the AFRF
(General))


The United States revealed its perception, in the National
Strategy for the Arctic Region issued in October 2022,
that the competition with Russia and China in the Arctic
Region is intensifying.[6] Moreover, on the security front,
the U.S. Government stated that it would deter the
threats against the U.S. mainland and allies by enhancing
the capabilities required to protect national interests in
the Arctic Region, and reduce the risk of unintentional
escalation through coordinating a common approach
with allies and partners. In addition, U.S. Marine forces
used to be deployed in Norway on a rotation basis for
a period of six months each year for training since
2017, but this rotation deployment has been changed
to a format under which forces with a larger number of
personnel are dispatched for a shorter period of time in
conjunction with training since October 2020. In October
2018, the United States sent an aircraft carrier to the
Arctic Region for the first time in 27 years for air drills
in the Norwegian Sea. And, in May 2020, United States
and United Kingdom warships took part in activities in
the Barents Sea for the first time since the end of the
Cold War. In March 2021, a B-1 bomber landed for the
first time inside the Arctic Circle. In March 2022, the
U.S. Navy conducted the exercise “Ice Exercise 2022”
that involved the participation of two Los Angeles-class
nuclear submarines as well as the Royal Canadian Navy,
Royal Canadian Air Force, and British Royal Navy.
Aside from coastal states in the Arctic Ocean, 13
countries including Japan, China, the ROK, the United
Kingdom, Germany and France, have observer status
in the Arctic Council. China shows a stance to be
proactively involved in the Arctic Sea. It is pointed out
that China could take advantage of scientific survey and
commercial activities to increase its presence including
military activities in the Arctic Sea.[7]

Russia was supposed to be the chair country of the Arctic Council for two years from May 2021. However, in March 2022, the remaining seven Arctic region countries stated that they would stop
participating in all the meetings of the Council with Russia as the chair country because of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.

The United States revealed its perception about Russia that the country made vast investment for its military presence in the Arctic Region in the last decade, while it also built up new economic
infrastructure in the region and attempted to limit free navigation through excessive claims to territorial waters. The United States has pointed out that Russia’s aggression against Ukraine has
heightened geopolitical tensions even in the Arctic Region, created new risks of unintended conflict, and hampered cooperation. It also recognized that China has emphasized its intention to amplify
its influence and play greater roles in the Arctic Region through expanding its economic, diplomatic, scientific, and military activities. The United States also pointed out that China doubled its
investment for mining of important mineral resources in particular in the last decade, and conducted research of dual use for military application in the Arctic Region.

2 In September 2022, the United States released that the United States retained 1,420 strategic nuclear warheads and 659 missiles/aircrafts as the delivery vehicles for them; and Russia
retained 1,549 warheads and 540 missiles/aircrafts; based on the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (the new START) between the United States and Russia as of September 1, 2022.
However, the SIPRI Yearbook 2022 said, as of January 2021, the United States deployed 1,744 nuclear warheads (including 100 tactical ones) and Russia deployed 1,588 warheads.

3 The Integrated Review by the UK in March 2022 stipulated that the UK will move to an overall nuclear weapon stockpile of no more than 260 warheads.

4 According to the SIPRI Yearbook 2022, the nuclear warhead inventories of India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea are 160, 165, 90, and around 20, respectively. Among others, North Korea
retains fissionable materials enough to produce 45-55 warheads as a whole

expressed a firm commitment not to abandon its nuclear
weapons in September 2022.
Regarding nuclear capabilities of the United States
and Russia, the two countries had agreed on a five-year
extension of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
(New START) in January 2021. However, as Russia
continued its aggression against Ukraine while repeating
words and actions that could be interpreted as threats to
use nuclear weapons, talks between the two countries
under the framework of the treaty was postponed in
November 2022, and Russia announced that it would
suspend the treaty’s implementation in February 2023.
Although the United States expresses its intention to


pursue a framework of arms control with China included,
China repeatedly rejects to be involved in the framework
between the United States and Russia. Meanwhile China
is said to continuously enhance its nuclear capability, as
well as it might retain 1,500 nuclear warheads by 2035.[1]

The post-Cold War international order faces serious
challenges amidst historical changes in the balance of
power and intensifying geopolitical competitions. It
is necessary to closely monitor relevant trends to see
if an effective framework of nuclear arms control and
disarmament will be established in the future.

See Fig. I-4-6-1 (Number of Nuclear Warheads Arsenals and Their

Major Means of Delivery by Country)

**Biological and Chemical Weapons**
**2**


Regarding chemical weapons, North Korea is an
example of an actor that is still presumed to possess these
chemical weapons and has not entered into the Chemical
Weapons Convention (CWC). The threat of terrorist
attacks by weapons of mass destruction in urban areas
was materialized with incidents such as the sarin attack in
the Tokyo subway in 1995. Recent years, some incidents
were also pointed out, including that chemical weapons
have been used by Syria’s Assad administration and that
the “Novichok” developed by Russia was allegedly used
for the murder attempt of leaders of political opposition.
The U.S. DoD, in a report published in 2022, voiced
its concern about China’s possible nonfulfillment of
the obligations specified in the Biological Weapons
Convention (BWC) and the CWC.[3]


**Part**
**Ⅰ**

**Chapter**


Biological and chemical weapons are relatively
inexpensive and easy to manufacture, as well as easy
to disguise because the materials and technologies
for manufacture are mostly dual-use. Therefore,
development and/or acquisition by nations or terrorists
seeking asymmetrical means for attack[2] is especially
concerning.
Biological weapons have the following characteristics:
(1) manufacturing is easy and inexpensive; (2) there
is usually an incubation period of a few days between
exposure and onset of the symptom; (3) their use is
hard to detect; (4) even the threat of use can create
great psychological effects; and (5) they can cause mass
casualties and injuries depending on the circumstances
of use and the type of weapon.



**Ballistic Missiles and Other Missiles**
**3**


Ballistic missiles are propelled by rockets for parabolic
flights and are capable of attacking distant targets. They
can be used as a means of delivering WMDs. As they fall
at a steep angle and high speed, highly accurate systems
are required for intercepting them effectively. Moreover,
technologies related to ballistic missiles have been
changing and developing quickly in recent years. For
example, newly emerged ballistic missiles fly at lower
altitudes with irregular trajectory than typical ballistic


missiles by controlling wings, aimed at complicating
early detection and interception of missiles.

See Fig. I-4-6-2 (Classification of Ballistic Missiles)

The deployment of ballistic missiles in areas with
continuous armed conflicts is dangerous because it can
intensify existing tensions and make the area unstable.
Furthermore, ballistic missiles are used as a means of
attacking from a distance or threatening another country


According to the annual report “Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China,” the U.S. DoD (2022)

They refer to means of attack to strike an adversary’s vulnerable points and are not conventional means. They include WMDs, ballistic missiles, terrorist attacks, and cyber attacks.


-----

that has superior conventional forces.
Along with the threat of ballistic missiles, the threat
of cruise missiles is also pointed out. This is because
cruise missiles are comparatively easy to acquire for
non-state actors such as terrorists, and can potentially
be proliferated. Cruise missiles are cheaper to produce
compared to ballistic missiles as well as easy to maintain
and train with, therefore many countries are producing
or modifying cruise missiles. Moreover, some cruise
missiles have relatively higher target accuracy, are
difficult to detect while cruising, and are able to approach
the targets while concealed on a ship, therefore they will
pose a serious threat when carrying WMDs with them.

**Growing Concerns about Transfer and Proliferation of WMDs and Other**
**4**
**Technologies**


Pakistan.
There has been significant transfer and proliferation
of ballistic missiles that serve as means of weapon
delivery as well. The former Soviet Union and other
countries exported Scud-B to many countries and
regions, including Iraq, North Korea, and Afghanistan.
China and North Korea also exported DF-3 (CSS-2) and
Scud missiles respectively. As a result, a considerable
number of countries and other actors now possess
ballistic missiles.
North Korea is believed to have advanced its ballistic
missile development with almost no test launches using
various resources and technologies transferred from
outside during the 1980s and 1990s. On the other hand,
it is believed that North Korea continuously proliferates
technologies, conventional weapons, and items used
in the supply chains of Weapons of Mass Destruction
(WMDs) to acquire foreign currencies. For example,
North Korea reportedly cooperates militarily with Iran,
Syria, Myanmar, and other countries, including in areas
such as arms trading and weapon technology transfers.
The decisive attitude of the international society
pressured nations involved in transferring and
proliferation of mass-destruction weapons, and has
resulted in acceptance of inspections by international
organizations. Meanwhile, it is pointed out that, in recent
years, states of particular concern have sustained their
external transfer while skillfully averting international
monitoring by falsifying documentation and diversifying
transport routes to illicitly export WMDs Another

-  Ballistic missiles launched from submarines are collectively referred to as submarinelaunched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), while a ballistic missile that has a precision guidance
system on its warhead necessary to attack aircraft carriers and other vessels is called an
anti-ship ballistic missile (ASBM).


**Part**
**Ⅰ**

**Chapter**


Even weapons that were purchased or developed for
self-defense purposes could easily be exported or
transferred once domestic manufacturing becomes
successful. For example, certain states that do not heed
political risks have transferred WMDs and related
technologies to other states that cannot afford to invest
resources in conventional forces and attempt to offset
this with WMDs. Some of these states that seek WMDs
do not hesitate to put their land and people at risk, and
furthermore, due to their weak governance, terrorist
organizations are active in their territories. Therefore, it
is conceivable that in general, the possibility of actual
use of WMDs would increase.
Moreover, since it is uncertain whether such states can
effectively manage the related technology and materials,
there is a concern that chemical or nuclear substances
will be transferred or smuggled out from these states
with high likelihood. For example, there is a danger that
even terrorists who do not possess related technologies
would use a dirty bomb to release radioactive materials
for pollution as a means of attack so long as they gain
access to such materials. Nations across the world share
concerns regarding the acquisition and use of WMDs by
terrorists and other non-state actors.
The proliferation of WMDs and other related
technologies has been reported in numerous instances.
For example, it was revealed in February 2004 that
nuclear-related technologies, mainly uranium enrichment
technology, had been transferred to North Korea, Iran,
and Libya by Dr A Q Khan and other scientists in


-----

concern has been arisen that these states are also
conducting intangible technology transfer. Specifically,
these states have obtained advanced technologies that
could be adapted for the development and manufacture


of WMDs through their researchers and students
dispatched to major companies and academic institutions
in developed countries.

**Initiatives for Climate Change**
**2**

The United States is accelerating its initiatives to deal
with climate change. The U.S. Government sets climate
change into the center of its foreign policies and national
security, and aims to achieve Net Zero[1] by 2050. In
2022, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) issued
the Climate Adaptation Plan Progress Report.[2] The
Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy,
and the Department of the Air Force also issued a series
of strategic documents and materials related to climate
change in 2022.
The U.S. Department of the Army issued the Army
Climate Strategy (ACS) in February 2022. In the ACS,
the increasing demand for humanitarian and disaster
response and the challenges to the army’s readiness are
mentioned as impacts of climate change. In addition, it
is pointed out that, as secondary impacts, adversaries and
other malign actors may seize dwindling resources while
seeking new opportunities to threaten U.S. national
interests. The U.S. Army also set the goals of reducing
the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to 50% by
2030, compared to 2005 levels, achieving Net Zero
by 2050, introducing microgrids[3] to its installations,
supplying 100% carbon-free electricity, and deploying
electric vehicles and other actions. In February 2022, the
hybrid type of main infantry fighting vehicle Bradley
was made public. Furthermore, in October 2022, the U.S.
Army issued the Climate Strategy Implementation Plan,[4]
in which it set specific objectives and tasks over the next
five years to achieve the objectives raised in the ACS and
clarified each supervising department, target completion
date, evaluation index, priority, and resources.
The U.S. Department of the Navy issued the Climate
Action 2030 in May 2022. The department pointed out
in this document that climate crisis directly threatens the
ability of the Navy and Marine Corps to execute those


missions. It stated that the Department has an urgent
charge to build a climate-ready force, and that to do
so, it will work towards building robust forces against
climate change and mitigating the threat from climate
change. The department also stated that it will achieve
a 65 percent reduction by 2030, compared to 2008, and
achieve Net Zero by 2050. Furthermore, it announced
that the Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany became
the first installation in the entire Department to achieve
Net Zero energy, by implementing a range of innovative
energy technologies including a biomass steam turbine
and landfill gas generators.
The U.S. Department of the Air Force that is
responsible for the largest portion of the DoD’s GHG
emissions[5] pointed out in its Climate Action Plan
published in October 2022 various impacts brought to
the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Space Force by climate
change, and stated that they recognized that they are
contributing to global climate change. The department
also stated that aviation fuel and energy to power aircraft
comprised over 80 percent of the department’s energy
use, and that for optimizing energy use and pursuing
alternative energy sources as one of its priorities, it is
aiming to reduce aviation fuel usage with advanced
technologies and new design for aircraft[6] working with
industry and is piloting the micro-reactor.
Countries other than the United States are promoting
initiatives in response to climate change as well.
For example, in April 2022, electric vehicles (EVs)
were demonstrated to the Defence Minister and others
for introduction to the Indian Army. According to a press
release from the Ministry of Defence of India, General
Naravane, Chief of Army Staff (then), stated that the
future in transportation is EVs, and that the Indian
Army has to be a torch bearer to adopt this technology,

Net Zero refers to the balanced condition between the amount of GHGs produced artificially and the amount that is removed artificially from the atmosphere during a specific period of time.

Executive Order 14008: Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, and EO 14057: Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability call for preparing annual
adaptation plans and annual progress reports to convey the activities of each agency in the government in order to strengthen adaptation to climate and resilience. This report corresponds to the
Annual Progress Report and summarizes important steps taken by the DoD on the initiatives stated in the Climate Adaptation Plan issued in 2021.

A microgrid is a small regional electric network with control units to manage several power sources and load that is not dependent on supply from power stations. It can be operated independently

According to “Fiscal Year 2020 Operation Energy Annual Report” issued by the DoD, the energy used in operations of the Army, Navy and Marine Corps, and the Air Force in FY2020 were 10%,
36%, and 53% respectively of the whole DoD.

The British Royal Air Force completed the test
flight of Voyager air-to-air refueling tanker using 100%
sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for the first time in the
world as a currently used military aircraft in November
2022. According to the Ministry of Defence of the
United Kingdom, SAF is made from used cooking oil,
which could reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to
80%, lessen the RAF’s reliance on global supply chains,
and improve operational resilience.
Furthermore, International cooperation is also
developing.
NATO stated that it aims to become a leading
international organization in understanding the impacts
that climate change has on security and adapting to
these impacts. The new Strategic Concept adopted at
the Madrid Summit held in June 2022 notes that climate


change is a defining challenge of our time and has
profound impact on NATO’s security. It also emphasizes
the importance of integrating climate change and other
challenges with NATO’s core missions and taking
action in a cross-sectional manner, as climate change
also affects how militaries operate. NATO held its first
High-Level Dialogue on Climate Change and Security
in conjunction with this summit, with the participation of
its allies and partners. This dialogue is intended to be an
annual platform for international consultations on climate
change, address security impacts in a collaborative way
and exchange best practices.
This allows climate change to be recognized as a highpriority issue by all countries, and the defense ministries
and armed forces directly and indirectly affected by
climate change have demonstrated their commitment to
address the issue at all levels.

troops to be dispatched to the land, sea, or airspace of
other countries with the aim of using force; such overseas
deployment of troops would exceed the definition of the

inflict casualties and damage upon the enemy s military
force and to occupy enemy territory.
On the other hand, it is recognized as a matter
of course for Japan to be able to use the minimum
necessary level of force to defend itself under its right
of self-defense. For example, if Japan were to inflict
casualties and damage upon the enemy’s military force
under its right of self-defense, this constitutes a different
concept from the exercise of the right of belligerency,
even if the two sets of actions appear to be externally
equivalent. Occupation of enemy territory, however, is
not permissible because it would exceed the minimum
necessary level for self-defense.

means that Japan will not possess and maintain a
military capability strong enough to pose a threat to
other countries, beyond the minimum necessary for selfdefense.


**Part**
**Ⅱ**

**Chapter**


Article 9, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution prescribes
that “the right of belligerency of the state will not be
recognized.” However, the “right of belligerency” does
not mean the right to engage in battle; rather, it is a
general term for various rights that a belligerent nation
has under international law, including the authority to

**Basic Policy**
**3**


Under the Constitution, Japan has efficiently built a
highly effective and joint defense force in line with the
basic principles of maintaining an exclusively defenseoriented policy and not becoming a military power that
poses a threat to other countries, while firmly maintaining
the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, adhering to the
principle of civilian control of the military, and observing
the Three Non-Nuclear Principles.

**1  Exclusively Defense-Oriented Policy**


**3 Non-Nuclear Principles**


The Three Non-Nuclear Principles refers to those of
not possessing nuclear weapons, not producing them,
and not allowing them to be brought into Japan. Japan
adheres to the Three Non-Nuclear Principles as a fixed
line of national policy.
Japan is also prohibited from manufacturing and
possessing nuclear weapons under the Atomic Energy
Basic Law.[1] In addition, Japan ratified the Treaty on
the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), and
as a nonnuclear weapons state, has an obligation not to
manufacture and acquire nuclear weapons.[2]

**4 Securing Civilian Control**


The exclusively defense-oriented policy means that
defensive force is used only in the event of an attack,
that the extent of the use of defensive force is kept to
the minimum necessary for self-defense, and that the
defense capabilities to be possessed and maintained by
Japan are limited to the minimum necessary for selfdefense. The policy including these matters refers to the
posture of a passive defense strategy in accordance with
the spirit of the Constitution.

**2 Not Becoming a Military Power**


Civilian control refers to the priority of politics to the
military in a democratic state or democratic political
control of military strength. Japan has, by giving serious
reflection to the regrettable state of affairs that happened
until the end of World War II, adopted the following


There is no established definition for the concept of a
military power. For Japan, however, not becoming
a military power that could threaten other countries


Article 2 of the Atomic Energy Basic Law states that “utilization of atomic energy shall be limited to peaceful purposes, aimed at ensuring safety and performed independently under democratic
management.”

strict civilian control system that is entirely different
from the one under the former Constitution.[3] Civilian
control aims to ensure that the SDF is maintained and
operated in accordance with the will of the people.
The Diet, which represents Japanese nationals, makes
legislative and budgetary decisions on such matters
as the allotted number of the SDF personnel and main
organizations of the Ministry of Defense (MOD)/SDF.
It also issues approval for defense operations of the
SDF. The function of national defense entirely falls
under the executive power of the Cabinet as a general
administrative function. The Constitution requires that
the Prime Minister and other Ministers of State who
constitute the Cabinet be civilians. The Prime Minister,
on behalf of the whole Cabinet, holds the authority of
supreme command and supervision of the SDF. The
Minister of Defense, who is exclusively in charge
of national defense, exercises general control and
supervises over the SDF duties. In addition, the National
Security Council of Japan under the Cabinet deliberates
important matters on national security.
At the MOD, the Minister of Defense takes charge of
and manages the matters concerning national defense,
and as the competent minister also manages and operates
the SDF. The Minister of Defense is assisted in policy
planning and political affairs by the State Minister of
Defense, the Parliamentary Vice-Ministers of Defense
(two) and the Senior Adviser to the Minister of Defense.
In addition, the Special Advisers to the Minister of
Defense provide the Minister of Defense with advice on
important affairs under the jurisdiction of the MOD based
on their expertise and experience. The Defense Council
consisting of political appointees, civilian officials and
uniformed SDF personnel deliberates on basic principles
concerning affairs under the Ministry’s jurisdiction.
Through these ways, the MOD aims to further ensure
civilian control.
As mentioned above, the civilian control system is well
established. However, in order to ensure that the system
achieves good results, it is necessary to continue making
practical efforts in both political and administrative
aspects, along with a deep interest in national defense
taken by the people.

NDS replaces the National Defense Program Guidelines

for the development, sustainment, and operation of the
defense capability of the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) and
formulated six times since 1976. The NSS and NDS are
mainly designed for the next decade or so.
The first-ever DBP was formulated in December
2022 in accordance with the NDS as a medium- to longterm plan that establishes the level of Japan’s defense
capabilities, the SDF’s structure which is based on the
capability level roughly a decade into the future, and the
total expenditures and the quantity of major equipment
to be acquired over a five-year period. The future level
of Japan’s defense capabilities had been previously
established in the NDPG, while the total expenditures
for the buildup of defense capability over a five-year
period were set forth in the MTDP, which was in turn
based on the NDPG. However, the level of Japan’s
defense capabilities as well as the total expenditures over
a five-year period have now been integrated into a single,
unified defense buildup plan.

**Fundamental Principles Concerning Japan’s National Security**

As a prerequisite for the execution of Japan’s national
security policy in pursuit of protecting its national
interests, the following are the fundamental principles
concerning Japan’s national security.
〇 Japan will maintain the policy of Proactive Contribution
to Peace based on international cooperation. In order
to further embody this principle in the international
community and to protect our own national interests


in the time ahead, and based on the recognition
that the primary responsibility for defending Japan
lies with itself, Japan will squarely face the everchanging security environment by decisively taking
on necessary reforms and reinforcing our national
security capabilities and roles.
〇 Japan will execute its security policy in a manner
that maintains and upholds universal values such

global power shifting to the Indo-Pacific region. Actions
to challenge the international order are accelerating. The
following are prominent examples of the complexity and
severity of the current international environment.
〇 Unilateral changes to the status quo by force and such
attempts against the territorial sovereignty and others
of other nations are taking place.
〇 In the domains of cyber, maritime, space, and
electromagnetic spectrum, and other areas, the risks
are becoming increasingly serious.
〇 Economic security is increasingly necessary. Some
nations are trying to expand their own influence by
economically coercing other nations.
〇 Global governance is being undermined, and the
international community is presented with greater
difficulties to rally together in taking on common
challenges such as climate change.

and present an unprecedented and the greatest strategic
challenge in ensuring the peace and security of Japan and
the peace and stability of the international community, as
well as in strengthening the international order based on
the rule of law, to which Japan should respond with its
comprehensive national power and in cooperation with
its ally, like-minded countries and others.

**(2) North Korea’s Activities in the Area of Security**
North Korea is making rapid progress in its missilerelated technologies and operational capabilities.
Furthermore, North Korea intends to bolster its nuclear
capabilities at the maximum speed.
North Korea’s military activities pose an even more
grave and imminent threat to Japan’s national security
than ever before.
Moreover, the issue of abductions is a critical issue
concerning the sovereignty of Japan and the lives and
safety of Japanese citizens. It is an urgent issue for the
Government to resolve under its responsibility.


**Part**

**Chapter**


**(3) Russia’s Activities in the Area of Security**
Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and its other
actions clearly demonstrate that it does not hesitate
to resort to military forces to achieve its own security
objectives. Russia is strengthening its armaments and
accelerating its activities in the Northern Territories as
well. Furthermore, Russia has been doubling down on
strategic coordination with China.
By its recent aggression against Ukraine and others,
Russia’s external and military activities and others have
shaken the very foundation of the international order,
and are perceived as the most significant and direct
threat to security in the European region. In addition,
Russia’s external and military activities and others in the
Indo-Pacific region, including Japan, together with its
strategic coordination with China, are of strong security
concern.

See Fig. II-2-2 (Table Comparing the Military Trends Related to

Japan’s Neighboring Countries and Regions)


Guided by the vision of a Free and Open Indo-Pacific
(hereinafter referred to as the “FOIP”), Japan has the
vital importance to its national security of striving to
realize a free and open international order based on the
rule of law and securing regional peace and stability.

**(1) China’s Activities in the Area of Security**
China has been extensively and rapidly enhancing its
military power without sufficient transparency and has
continued and intensified unilateral changes to the status
quo by force and such attempts in the East and South
China Seas. Furthermore, China is strengthening its
strategic ties with Russia and attempting to challenge
the international order. Furthermore, there have been
instances of China’s development finance lacking
adequate transparency and China taking advantage of
other countries’ dependence on China to exert economic
pressure on other countries. With regard to Taiwan,
China has not denied the possibility of using military
force. In addition, China has been intensifying its
military activities around Taiwan.
China’s current external stance, military activities,
and other activities have become a matter of serious
concern for Japan and the international community,

**National Security Objectives of Japan**
**5**


The following are the national security objectives of
Japan to ensure its national interests.
〇 Japan will continue to be a nation capable of protecting
its sovereignty and independence, autonomously
determining its domestic and foreign policies, and
defending its territory and the safety of life, person,
and the properties of its nationals. To this end, Japan
will reinforce its own capabilities and roles, and
together with its ally, the United States, and likeminded countries and others, deter contingencies and
attempts to unilaterally change the status quo in Japan
and its vicinity. If by any chance a threat should reach
Japan, Japan will disrupt and defeat the threat and
minimize the damage caused, and bring it to an end in
a manner favorable to protecting its national interests.
〇 Japan will proactively ensure, through executing
its security policy, an international environment in
which its own economy can grow. By doing so, Japan
will work to achieve a virtuous cycle of security
and economic growth, in which economic growth


promotes the improvement of the security environment
surrounding Japan. Concurrently, Japan will ensure
the self-reliance of its economic structure, as well as
advantages over other countries and ultimately the
indispensability of its technologies.
〇 As a major global actor, Japan will join together with
its ally, like-minded countries and others to achieve
a new balance in international relations, especially
in the Indo-Pacific region. In so doing, Japan will
prevent the emergence of situations in which any one
state can unilaterally change the status quo easily, and
redouble efforts to secure a stable, predictable, free
and open international order based on the rule of law.
〇 Japan will work on multilateral cooperation in
the fields of international economy, response to
global issues such as climate change and infectious
diseases, and the formation of international rules and
regulations, and then generate an environment in
which the international community can coexist and
coprosper.

destabilize the area surrounding Japan, instead of directly
countering military threats to Japan. This concept was
basically followed by 1995 NDPG.
On the other hand, the details of Japan’s defense
capabilities as set forth in 1995 NDPG were notable
for the fact that in addition to reviewing the scale and


functions of defense capabilities, they also emphasized
a greater utilization of the SDF’s capabilities not only
for the “defense of the nation,” but also in various other
areas, including “dealing with various contingencies
such as major disasters” and “contributing to building a
more stable security environment.”

posed to Japan. To achieve these objectives, Japan
would combine three approaches in an integrated
manner, namely through “its own efforts,” “cooperation
with the ally,” and “cooperation with the international
community.” The document stated that with regard
to Japan’s approach to its defense capabilities, the
effective parts of the “Basic Defense Force Concept”
would be retained while placing a greater emphasis
on Japan’s “response capabilities” and recognizing
that “multifunctional, flexible, and effective defense
capabilities” were required to respond to the new threats
and diverse contingencies.


**Part**
**Ⅱ**

**Chapter**


2004 NDPG[5]was formulated based on the determination
that it was necessary to provide new guidelines for
Japan’s approach to its national security and defense
capabilities in response to new threats and diverse
contingencies, including the proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction and ballistic missiles, as well as the
activities of international terrorist organizations.
2004 NDPG specified two security objectives: (i) to
prevent direct threats from reaching Japan, and should
a threat arise, to eliminate the threat and minimize the
damage caused; and (ii) to improve the international
security environment and ensure that no threats are


**2010 NDPG**
**4**


2010 NDPG[6]was formulated based on the facts that (i)
large-scale military forces, including nuclear forces, had
continued to exist in the area surrounding Japan, and
many states were modernizing their military capabilities
and intensifying their various activities; (ii) the period
of time from the emergence of signs of a threat to the
actual occurrence of a situation had tended to be shorter
with the rapid development of military science and
technology, and there was a need to respond seamlessly
to such situations; and (iii) given that many security
issues transcend national borders, ongoing coordination
and cooperation between different countries had become
increasingly vital, with the roles of military forces
diversifying as well, making it more common for military


forces to be operating continuously at all times.
2010 NDPG stated that Japan’s future defense
capabilities should be “dynamic in form” and focused
on the “operation of defense capabilities” as well as
the ability to actively carry out various activities to
effectively fulfill the assigned roles of such capabilities
without being bound by the existing “Basic Defense
Force Concept,” which only emphasized the “existence
of defense capabilities.” To this end, it was determined
that a “Dynamic Defense Force” equipped with the
qualities of readiness, mobility, flexibility, sustainability,
and versatility would be built and supported by advanced
technological and intelligence capabilities that took into
account trends in the levels of military technologies.

2013 NDPG[7] was formulated against the backdrop of an increasingly severe security environment surrounding

Japan in which the defense capabilities that underpinned
the various activities of the SDF could no longer be
guaranteed to be adequate in “quality” and “quantity”
in view of the increasing number and longer duration of
situations that required a response by the SDF, including
so-called “gray-zone” situations.
2013 NDPG took these considerations into account
and stipulated the enhancement of Japan’s deterrence
and response capabilities by placing greater emphasis
on joint operations, improving the operational level of
equipment and its employment, and by ensuring that the
defense capabilities that underpinned various activities
would be adequate both in “quality” and “quantity.” To
this end, it was determined that capability assessments
would be conducted from the viewpoint of joint


operations with a focus on the functions and capabilities
of the SDF as a whole, in order to identify the functions
and capabilities that should be of particular focus from
a comprehensive perspective. Harnessing the results of
these capability assessments would allow Japan to adapt
to the ever-changing security environment surrounding it
and efficiently develop its defense capabilities in a wellbalanced manner. In addition, its logistical support base
would be extensively reinforced to establish a posture
that ensures its most effective operation.
In the above ways, 2013 NDPG sought to develop a
“Dynamic Joint Defense Force,” a more effective defense
force capable of conducting a variety of activities in a
swift and flexible manner.

**Chapter**


**2018 NDPG**
**6**


2018 NDPG[8] was formulated with the aim of building
a truly effective defense force by further deepening
the approach of a “Dynamic Joint Defense Force” in
view of the remarkably fast pace at which the security
environment surrounding Japan had become increasingly
severe and uncertain.
Specifically, Japan would build a “Multi-Domain
Defense Force” as a truly effective defense force that
was capable of (i) carrying out cross-domain operations
that organically would integrate capabilities in all
domains, generating synergy and amplifying overall
capabilities; (ii) enabling the sustained conduct of
flexible and strategic activities during all phases from
peacetime to contingencies; and (iii) strengthening the
Japan-U.S. Alliance and promoting security cooperation.
In particular, as capabilities in new domains, which are
space, cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum, could
substantially enhance the military’s overall capabilities to
conduct operations, states are exerting efforts to improve
capabilities in these fields. Japan would also focus on
enhancing such capabilities as well as capabilities
to effectively counter attacks by aircraft, ships, and
missiles in combination therewith, and enhancing the
sustainability and resiliency of its defense capabilities,
including logistical support.

The policies concerning the fundamental

by the Government through the NDS and DBP, represent
a major turning point for post-war defense policy. By
formulating the NDS, which provides mid- to long-

-----

Japan s security and defense policy has a direct link to
the peace and stability of the region and the international
community. Amid the most severe and complex security
environment since the end of WWII, Japan needs
to face the grim reality and fundamentally reinforce
Japan’s defense capabilities, with a focus on opponent
capabilities and new ways of warfare, to protect the lives
and peaceful livelihoods of Japanese nationals. Japan
also needs to strengthen Japan’s architecture for national
defense. Thinking strategically, Japan should promote
these two lines of effort as a coherent whole. It is this
undertaking that provides the way forward to bolster
Japan’s deterrence capabilities and further strengthen
the Japan-U.S. Alliance, and which forms the foundation


of security cooperation with like-minded countries
and others. In particular, in October 2022, the United
States also devised a new National Defense Strategy.
The formulation of Japan’s NDS is therefore timely for
Japan and the United States in aligning their respective
strategies.
Based on this recognition, the Government finalizes
the NDS, replacing the NDPG. The policies concerning
the fundamental reinforcement of defense capabilities
and the levels of defense buildup that underpin it
represent a major turning point for post-war defense
policy. The Government will make efforts to deepen the
Japanese public’s understanding about the significance
of this major turning point.

of warfare and thus prove to become “game changers.” In
addition, there exist a range of global security challenges
such as increasingly serious risks in cyber and other
domains, the expansion of information warfare including
the dissemination of disinformation, and climate change.

**2 Military Trends of Japan’s Neighboring**
**Countries and Regions**


**1 Changes in the Strategic Environment**

It is imperative to carefully analyze the harsh reality
of the security environment surrounding Japan, which
serves as the backdrop against which the NDS was
formulated. The NDS has analyzed the changes in the
strategic environment as follows.
First, states that do not share universal values or
political and economic systems are expanding their
influence. Unilateral changes to the status quo by force
and such attempts represent significant challenges to the
existing international order. Russia’s aggression against
Ukraine has revealed this in a most blatant way. The
international community is facing the greatest post-war
trial yet, and has entered a new era of crisis.
In addition, the global power balance has significantly
changed and interstate competition across the political,
economy, and military spheres is emerging. Such trends
are especially notable in the Indo-Pacific region, where
China has been continuing and amplifying its unilateral
changes to the status quo by force and such attempts.
Furthermore, as the interstate competition between
China and the United States is expected to further
intensify in various fields, the United States has presented
a view that the next ten years will be the decisive decade
for its competition with China.
Rapid advances in science and technology are
fundamentally changing the paradigm of security.
Countries are striving to develop cutting-edge
technologies that could dramatically alter the character


In the report to the National Congress of the Chinese
Communist Party in 2017 (hereinafter referred to as the
“NCCPC”), China sets the goals of “basically completing
modernization of national defense and the military” by
2035 and building “a world-class forces” by the middle
of this century. And in the Fifth Plenary Session of the
19th Communist Party of China Central Committee in
2020, the achievement of “the centenary goal of the
People’s Liberation Army” by 2027 was added as a
target. In a report to the NCCPC in 2022, it was newly
stated that elevating the People’s Liberation Army to a
“world-class standards” at an early stage is a strategic
task for fully building “a modern socialist country.”
With these goals in mind, China has been extensively
and rapidly enhancing its military capability in a
qualitative and quantitative manner. China defines the
next five years as the crucial period to start the full-scale
construction of a “modern socialist country.” Supported
by the rapid growth of defense expenditures, China
has been reinforcing its military capabilities, including

numbers than does Japan. China has been intensifying its
activities across the entire region surrounding Japan and
is increasing military pressure on Taiwan. In the South
China Sea, it continues to entrench its military foothold.
Moreover, China has launched nine ballistic missiles
on August 4, 2022, five of which landed within Japan’s
Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). This was perceived as
a threat to local residents. China’s current external stance,
military activities, and other activities have become a
matter of serious concern for Japan and the international
community, and present an unprecedented and the greatest
strategic challenge in ensuring the peace and security of
Japan and the peace and stability of the international
community, as well as in strengthening the international
order based on the rule of law, to which Japan should
respond with its comprehensive national power including
defense capabilities and in cooperation and collaboration
with its ally, like-minded countries and others.
In order to maintain its regime, North Korea has
concentrated its efforts on enhancing its arsenal of
weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and ballistic
missiles. It is assessed that North Korea already possesses
the technological capabilities to mount a nuclear warhead
on its ballistic missiles, whose range includes Japan and
is able to attack Japan with such a missile. North Korea
is rapidly improving its missile-related technologies
and operational capabilities in particular, such as by
repeatedly launching missiles from various platforms.
North Korea’s military activities pose an even more
grave and imminent threat to Japan’s national security
than ever before.
Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is perceived as
the most significant and direct threat to defense in the
European region. As for the areas surrounding Japan,
the Russian forces are also accelerating their military
activities in the Far East region including the Northern
Territories. Russia’s military activities in the IndoPacific region including Japan, together with its strategic
coordination with China, are of strong concern from a
defense perspective.

In case that these activities are conducted

necessary to take a close look at what implication they
would have for the region.

**3 Defense Challenges**

**Ⅱ**

**Chapter**


The military background for Russia’s aggression against
Ukraine was that Ukraine did not possess sufficient
capabilities to deter Russian aggression. Also, while
no country can defend its own security by itself alone,
there is a renewed recognition of the importance of
cooperation with allies who have the intention and
capability to respond to invasions jointly.
Also worth paying attention to in this event is that
a country with strong military capability has one day
come to possess the intention to launch an aggression. A
threat materializes when the capability to inflict harm is
combined with the intention to do so; accurately gauging
other’s intent from outside is inherently difficult. When a
state’s decision-making process is opaque, there always
exists conditions under which threat may materialize. To
protect one’s own country from such states, it is necessary
to have deterrence capability, thereby making said states
realize that unilateral changes to the status quo by force
are difficult; it is also necessary to build one’s own defense
capability focusing on opponent capabilities.
Regarding the way of warfare, in addition to the
traditional forms of invasion through air, sea, and
land, new ways of warfare have emerged with the
combination of massive missile strike by precision
strike capabilities, hybrid warfare including information
warfare, asymmetric attacks leveraging the domains of
space, cyber, and electromagnetic spectrum and with
unmanned assets, and public remarks that could be
interpreted as threat using nuclear weapons. Whether or
not to be able to respond to these new ways of warfare is
a major challenge in building future defense capabilities.

demonstrating Japan s resolve and capability to defend
itself to the end. Based on the security environment
surrounding Japan and defense challenges described
above, Japan must clearly demonstrate the intention
that Japan will never tolerate unilateral changes to the
status quo by force and such attempts in any situation.
To this end, Japan must fundamentally reinforce defense
capabilities with a focus on opponents’ capabilities and
the ways they prosecute warfare and actively adapt to
new ways of warfare.

**(2) Three Defense Objectives**
Japan’s defense objectives are, firstly, to shape a security
environment that does not tolerate unilateral changes to
the status quo by force. The second is to deter, through
cooperation and collaboration with our ally, like-minded
countries and others, unilateral changes to the status quo
by force and such attempts and to bring the situation
under control at an early stage. The third is, should
invasion of Japan occur, to take primary responsibility
to deal with the aggression and to disrupt and defeat
the invasion, while receiving support from the ally and
others.
In dealing with the threat of nuclear weapons, U.S.
extended deterrence, with nuclear deterrence at its core,
is essential. Japan will defend itself to the end in all
situations through the combination of its own efforts to
achieve the first, second, and third defense objectives
and extended deterrence and others provided by the
United States.

**2 First Approach: Strengthening Japan’s**
**Own Architecture for National Defense**


**(1) Fundamental Reinforcement of Japan’s Defense**
**Capabilities**

Defense capability is the ultimate guarantor of Japan’s
security. Japan has aimed to build a defense capability
that can respond to and deter a range of possible
situations in a truly effective manner. In accordance with
the 2018 NDPG, Japan, in order to operate seamlessly
across all phases from peacetime to armed contingencies,
has striven to build the Multi-Domain Defense Force
(which organically fuses capabilities in the domains of
space, cyber, and electromagnetic spectrum with those
in ground, maritime, and air domains and is capable of
sustained and flexible activities through joint operations).
Under the NDS, Japan will fundamentally reinforce the
current Multi-Domain Defense Force through further
accelerated efforts.
With a fundamentally reinforced defense capability,
Japan should be able to take primary responsibility to
disrupt and defeat invasion against Japan. This means
that Japan will possess a capability that makes the
opponent realize that the goal of invasion of Japan is
not achievable by military means, and that the damage
the opponent will incur makes the invasion not worth
the cost. If Japan possesses such defense capability,
coupled with that of the United States, will be able to
deter not only an invasion against Japan, but also deter
unilateral changes to the status quo by force and such
attempts in the Indo-Pacific region. This will help foster
a security environment where such forcible actions are
not tolerated. This is why Japan will fundamentally
reinforce its defense capabilities.
Moreover, a fundamentally reinforced defense
capability should include persistent intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); training and
exercises conducted as Flexible Deterrent Options
(FDO); and measures against aircraft intruding into
Japan’s territorial airspace. Such a defense capability
should also be able to swiftly respond to and address a
range of situations in a seamless manner. Such a defense
capability must come with high readiness and response
capability. We need to prepare training infrastructures
both inside and outside Japan; we also need a flexible

defense, to fundamentally reinforce Japan’s defense
capabilities, which constitute the core of national
defense, and to reinforce the defense architecture of
the whole country. The second is to further reinforce
joint deterrence and response capability of the JapanU.S. Alliance and demonstrate the joint resolve and
capabilities of Japan and the Unites States. The third is to
reinforce collaboration with like-minded countries and
others and reinforce collaboration with as many countries
as possible. In addition, Japan will reinforce its defense

work environment so that the SDF can, even in the face
of ever-increasing volume of peacetime operations,
conduct sufficient volume of training and exercises
necessary for improving the ability of SDF personnel
and the proficiency of SDF units.
As the functions and capabilities required for
adapting to new ways of warfare, Japan will first
strengthen (i) stand-off defense capabilities and (ii)
integrated air and missile defense capabilities, with
which to disrupt and defeat invading forces over long
distances, thereby deterring invasion itself. Japan will
strengthen (iii) unmanned defense capabilities, (iv)
cross-domain operation capabilities, and (v) command
and control/intelligence-related functions, in addition
to the capabilities (i) and (ii), to gain superiority across
domains and ensure asymmetric advantage, in case
where deterrence should fail. Japan will also strengthen
(vi) mobile deployment capabilities and civil protection
and (vii) sustainability and resiliency to operate in a swift
as well as persistent manner to crush to the opponent’s
will to invade.
Japan will need to promptly realize the fundamental
reinforcement of its defense capabilities as when
and how unilateral changes to the status quo occur
is hard to predict. First, by FY2027, five years after
the formulation of the NDS, Japan will strengthen its
defense capability to the point where Japan is able to
take primary responsibility for dealing with invasions
against this nation, and disrupt and defeat such threats
with the support of its ally and others. The top priorities
for the next five years are twofold: first, to maximize
effective use of its existing equipment, Japan will
improve operational rates, secure sufficient munitions
and fuel, and accelerate improving the resiliency of key
defense facilities; and second, Japan will fundamentally
strengthen its core capabilities for future operations,
such as stand-off defense capabilities and unmanned
defense capabilities. By approximately ten years from
now, Japan will make further efforts and will reinforce
its defense capabilities to the point where Japan is able
to disrupt and defeat invasion much earlier and at places
further afield.
This fundamental reinforcement of defense
capabilities entails significant costs and a commensurate
increase in personnel strength. In a way that serves
to realize fundamental reinforcement of defense
capabilities, Japan will, while adhering to a scrap-andbuild approach optimize the SDF’s authorized strength


as well as equipment. We will also further the ongoing
efforts toward more efficient procurement, which have
achieved significant cost reductions, while giving due
consideration to the defense production base. In addition,
to account for population decrease and declining
birthrates/aging population, Japan will robustly promote
automation, labor-saving, and optimization.
A key to deterring invasion against Japan is
counterstrike capabilities that leverage stand-off defense
capability and other capabilities. In recent years, in
Japan’s surroundings, there have been significant
improvement of missile forces in both qualitative and
quantitative terms, and missiles themselves have been
repeatedly launched. Missile attacks have become a
palpable threat. Under these circumstances, Japan will
continue its steadfast efforts to both qualitatively and
quantitatively enhance its missile defense network;
however, it will become increasingly difficult to fully
address missile threats with the existing network alone.
For this reason, Japan needs counterstrike capabilities:
capabilities which enable Japan to mount effective
counterstrikes against the opponent to prevent further
attacks while defending against incoming missiles by
means of missile defenses. “Counterstrike capabilities”
are the SDF’s capabilities that leverage stand-off defense
capability and other capabilities. In cases where armed
attack against Japan has occurred, and as part of that
attack ballistic missiles and other means have been
used, counterstrike capabilities enable Japan to mount
effective counterstrikes against the opponent’s territory.
Counterstrikes are done as a minimum necessary
measure for self-defense and in accordance with the
Three New Conditions for Use of Force. By possessing
such capabilities to mount effective counterstrikes,
Japan will deter armed attack itself. If an opponent ever
launches missiles, it will be able to prevent the opponent’s
further armed attacks by counterstrike capabilities,
while protecting itself against incoming missiles by
the missile defense network, thereby defending the
lives and peaceful livelihoods of Japanese nationals.
Counterstrike capabilities fall within the purview of
Japan’s Constitution and international law; they do not
change Japan’s exclusively defense-oriented policy;
and they can be used only when the above-mentioned
Three New Conditions are fulfilled. Needless to say,
preemptive strikes, namely striking first at a stage when
no armed attack has occurred, remain impermissible.
While the basic division of roles between Japan and the


**Part**

United States will remain unchanged, as Japan will now
possess counterstrike capabilities, the two nations will
cooperate in counterstrikes.

**(2) Reinforcing the Defense Architecture of the**
**Whole Country**

To defend Japan, the SDF needs to be strong. National
defense cannot be achieved without a whole-of-country
approach. For this reason, in addition to fundamentally
reinforcing defense capabilities, Japan will build an
overall national defense architecture by integrating
Japan’s national power – diplomatic, intelligence,
economic, and technological – as well as by systematically
combining all policy means. To enhance the whole-ofgovernment undertaking, it is essential to break down
sectionalism within the Government. Japan will enhance
the comprehensive defense architecture that draws upon
Japan’s national power. This undertaking is an indivisible
part of the fundamental reinforcement of defense
capabilities. The national government will also promote
cooperation with local governments and private entities.
As part of specific efforts, diplomatic efforts underpinned
by Japan’s enhanced defense architecture come first, and
Japan will promote robust diplomatic efforts through the
promotion such as the vision of a Free and Open IndoPacific (FOIP). Also, in order to continue to demonstrate
the intention and capability to deter unilateral changes to
the status quo by force and such attempts and influence
opponent’s actions, it is necessary to improve and enhance
training and exercises as FDO and Strategic Communication
(SC) with a whole-of-government approach, as well as with
our ally and like-minded countries and others.
Japan will also enhance the whole-of-government
response to Integrated Information Warfare with special
regard to the cognitive dimension from peacetime to
armed contingencies.
Furthermore, in order to act collaboratively between
relevant agencies from peacetime and improve the
effectiveness of the response, the SDF will conduct
training and exercises assuming contingencies with the
police and Japan Coast Guard (hereinafter referred to
as the “JCG”) from peacetime, and establish necessary
collaboration procedures, including the procedure to
have the Minister of Defense control the JCG in an
armed attack situation.
Since the domains of space, cyber, and electromagnetic
spectrum are basic infrastructure in people’s daily lives
and are vitally important for carrying out cross domain


operations in defense of Japan, Japan will reinforce
relevant capabilities across the whole government.
In an era where victory or defeat is determined by
the mastery of new ways of warfare underpinned by
advanced technologies, it has become critical to leverage
cutting-edge technologies for defense purposes. Under
the whole-of-government mechanism for strengthening
comprehensive defense architecture, Japan will leverage
research and development conducted by relevant
government organizations for defense purposes based on
the needs of the MOD/SDF.
National administrative agencies, local governments,
public entities, and private enterprises must make joint
efforts in a cooperative and collaborative manner, in order
to respond to an invasion against Japan while protecting
the lives of Japanese nationals and in order to respond
to various contingencies including large-scale disasters.
As such, based on defense needs, under the inter-agency
mechanism for strengthening comprehensive defense
architecture, the Government will develop and upgrade
airports, seaports, and other facilities, particularly in the
southwestern region and take various measures such
as the establishment of a framework for interagency
coordination to enable the SDF to use facilities
such as airports and seaports on a daily basis and the
reinforcement of whole-of-government civil protection
training. Furthermore, Japan will establish an effective
mechanism to balance defense requirements with
socioeconomic activities such as the installation of wind
power generation facilities so that the defense-related
facilities can fully function through the SDF’s smooth
use of sea, airspace, and electromagnetic spectrum. In
addition, concerning the transportation and storages
of ammunition and fuel, Japan will take measures for
further facilitation.
In order to work to secure the national interest in
Japan’s territorial and other waters and the stable use
of its important sea lanes, the SDF and the JCG will
closely cooperate and collaborate with each other, while
promoting maritime security cooperation with our ally,
like-minded countries and others.
Lastly, to enable the SDF and the U.S. Forces in Japan to
seamlessly and effectively conduct activities on a daily basis,
Japan will strive to gain further understanding and cooperation
from local governments and residents around their facilities.
In some communities, the SDF’s emergency patient transport
and the very existence of SDF units themselves are making
a major contribution to the communities’ maintenance and

vitalization. In conducting unit reorganizations, as well
as placing and operating camps and bases, Japan will give
due consideration to regional characteristics and the SDF’s
contribution to local economy so as to gain understanding of
local governments and residents.

**3 Second Approach: Joint Deterrence and**
**Response by the Japan-U.S. Alliance**


To conduct aligned joint response of Japan and the United
States, Japan will further upgrade the overall coordination
functions centered on the Alliance Coordination Mechanism
(ACM). In addition, in order to enhance collaboration
with like-minded countries and others centered around the
Japan-U.S. Alliance, Japan will promote closer operational
coordination by leveraging the ACM and others.
Furthermore, as efforts to reinforce the foundation for
allied response, Japan will reinforce the foundational
elements that support effective allied response in all
phases, including information security, cybersecurity,
and defense equipment and technology cooperation.
The last is measures to support the stationing of
the U.S. Forces in Japan. Japan will promote various
measures to provide stable support for the stationing of
the U.S. Forces in Japan, such as steady implementation
of the realignment of the U.S. Forces in Japan and the
initiatives to reinforce the readiness and resiliency of the
U.S. Forces in Japan, while optimizing the bilateral joint
posture to respond to the severe security environment.

**4 Third Approach: Collaboration with**
**Like-minded Countries and Others**


**Part**
**Ⅱ**

**Chapter**


The second approach is to further strengthen the JapanU.S. Alliance. The Alliance with the United States is a key
pillar of Japan’s security, and fundamental reinforcement
of Japan’s defense capabilities will lead to more effective
employment of U.S. capabilities and will further
strengthen deterrence and response capabilities of the
Japan-U.S. Alliance. By demonstrating such joint resolve
and capabilities, Japan and the United States will deter
unilateral changes to the status quo by force and such
attempts. In addition, if an invasion against Japan occurs,
Japan-U.S. joint response will disrupt the invasion. To
this end, both Japan and the United States constantly
modernize the Alliance and strengthen joint capabilities
by aligning strategies and prioritizing goals together. In
doing so, building upon the fundamental reinforcement of
Japan’s own defense capabilities, Japan will play a larger
role for the defense of Japan and the peace and stability
of the region under the Japan-U.S. Alliance. Specifically,
Japan will work on the following measures.
The first is to strengthen Japan-U.S. joint deterrence
and response capabilities. Japan’s NDS and the United
States’ National Defense Strategy are well aligned in
prioritizing the prevention of unilateral changes to the
status quo by force through integrating all approaches and
means. Accordingly, from the viewpoint of reinforcing
readiness and resiliency, imposing cost on opponents, and
deterring invasion against Japan, Japan will further deepen
discussion with the United States on their roles, missions,
and capabilities and further reinforce joint deterrence
capabilities of both countries in an integrated manner.
The next is to reinforce alliance coordination functions.

The third approach is to enhance collaboration with
like-minded countries and others. In order to respond to
unilateral changes to the status quo by force and such
attempts and to ensure Japan’s security, it is extremely
important to reinforce collaboration with not only our
ally but also as many countries as possible. From such
perspective, Japan will promote efforts to contribute
to realizing the vision of a FOIP. Moreover, Japan
will proactively promote multilateral and multilayered
defense cooperation and exchanges, taking into account
characteristics and other factors of the region and each
country. In doing so, while promoting collaboration
with like-minded countries and others, Japan will pay
attention to communication with China and Russia.

Japan will reinforce its integrated air and missile defense
capabilities by efforts such as introducing research on
capability to respond to hypersonic weapons in the
gliding phase.

**1 Stand-off Defense Capabilities**


In order to protect Japan’s territory, which stretches
approximately 3,000 km along the both north-south and
east-west axes, Japan will fundamentally reinforce its
stand-off defense capabilities to deal with vessels and
landing forces invading Japan from locations outside of
threat zones. First of all, Japan will possess necessary
and sufficient capabilities to be able to disrupt and
defeat these vessels and others in a multilayered manner
and from various locations. Also, Japan will reinforce
capabilities that can be launched from various platforms
with such capabilities as hyper velocity glides and
hypersonic glides which are difficult to intercept. To this
end, by FY2027, Japan will reinforce capability to enable
operation of stand-off missiles. In doing so, to promptly
secure sufficient capability prior to the establishment of
increased production of domestic missiles, Japan will
procure stand-off missiles manufactured overseas. In the
future, by approximately ten years from now, Japan will
reinforce its capability to enable operation of aircraftlaunched stand-off missiles and will acquire capability
to operate missiles with difficult-to-intercept gliding
capabilities such as hyper velocity gliding missiles,
hypersonic guided missiles, and other stand-off missiles.

**3 Unmanned Defense Capabilities**


The combination of unmanned equipment with AI and
manned equipment enables Japan to gain asymmetrical
advantages. For this reason, these unmanned assets
will be effectively utilized not only for information
gathering and surveillance, but also for a wide range
of missions including combat support. Japan will also
promote initiatives to optimize the equipment system
and organization of the SDF. To this end, the SDF will
acquire practical capabilities in a wide range of missions
by introducing unmanned assets through early production
and deployment or leasing by FY2027. By approximately
ten years from now, Japan will further materialize the
style of warfare using unmanned assets, accelerate the
development and introduction of equipment based on the
geographical characteristics of Japan, and expand fullscale operation.

**4 Cross-domain Operation Capabilities**


In order to respond to hypersonic and other weapons,
Japan will fundamentally reinforce response capabilities
such as detecting, tracking, and intercepting capabilities.
As a response to the missile attacks from an opponent’s
country to Japan, Japan will first intercept missiles over
the high seas and Japan’s territorial airspace with its
missile defense system. Subsequently, as a measure for
self-defense to the minimum required level to prevent
attacks, Japan will utilize capabilities including standoff defense capabilities to enable itself to conduct
effective counterstrike in the opponent’s territory. By
having capability to conduct counterstrike and facilitate
interception by its missile defense system, Japan will
restrict the opponent’s missile launches and thereby
deter missile attacks from happening. To this end,
by FY2027, Japan will reinforce the capabilities of
warning and control radar and surface-to-air missile and
procure Aegis system equipped vessels. Japan will also
reinforce the capability to respond to small unmanned

spectrum, land, sea, and airspace to generate synergy and
amplify the overall strength, and thereby ensuring Japan’s
national defense. The MOD/SDF will first enhance and
expand capabilities necessary to disrupt or neutralize
the opponent’s use of the domains of space, cyber, and
electromagnetic spectrum and then work on the following.
(1) In the space domain, the MOD/SDF will reinforce
its operational capabilities in the land, sea, and air
domains by proactively integrating novel form of
space use including satellite constellation. Also, in
order to respond to threats to the stable use of space, the
MOD/SDF will build up a Space Domain Awareness
(hereinafter referred to as the “SDA”) structure, and
bolster the resiliency of our space assets to enable
the continuation of missions in response to various
situations. To this end, by FY2027, the MOD/SDF
will utilize space to develop essential infrastructure
for unit operations and enhance our SDA capability.
By approximately ten years from now, the MOD/SDF
will further enhance our space operation capabilities
by increasing multi-layering and redundancy in space
use and also by acquiring new space capabilities.
(2) In the cyber domain, the MOD/SDF will cooperate
with whole-of-government initiatives in the field
of cybersecurity, including active cyber defense.
The MOD/SDF will realize advanced cybersecurity
posture by shifting to a posture that is able to conduct
continuous risk management primarily on critical
information systems and by significantly increasing
the number of cyber personnel. To this end, by
FY2027, the MOD/SDF will establish a cybersecurity
posture to secure command and control capabilities
and high-priority equipment systems even under
cyberattacks and to support cyber defense of the
defense industry. By approximately ten years from
now, the MOD/SDF will establish a cybersecurity
posture to secure command and control capabilities,
force projection capabilities, and operational bases to
perform its missions even under cyberattacks, while
reinforcing its posture to support cybersecurity of
entities other than the SDF.
(3) In the domain of electromagnetic spectrum, the MOD/
SDF will make its electronic warfare capabilities
and its support capabilities function effectively
while impairing the opponent’s capabilities of
accomplishing missions even under a severe
electromagnetic spectrum environment including
communication jamming by the opponent Also the


MOD/SDF will reinforce electromagnetic spectrum
management function for the entire SDF to utilize
electromagnetic spectrum more effectively.
(4) Regarding ground, maritime, and air defense capabilities,
which form the basis of cross-domain operations, Japan
will fundamentally reinforce these capabilities including
by steadily introducing naval ships and fighter aircraft to
maintain and enhance maritime and air superiority.

The character of warfare will continue to increase in
speed and complexity. In order to win in future battles,
Japan needs to ensure superiority in decision-making,
whereby commanders at various levels can make
decisions more promptly and more accurately than
their opposites. For this purpose, Japan will enhance
its network resiliency and intelligence, surveillance,
reconnaissance, and targeting (hereinafter referred to
as the “ISRT”) capabilities, including the introduction
of AI. By FY2027, Japan will develop intelligence
capabilities capable of responding to hybrid warfare and
Integrated Information Warfare with special regard to the
cognitive dimension. Japan will also develop near-realtime information gathering capabilities by utilizing assets
such as satellite constellations By approximately ten

In addition, the necessity to continuously and
accurately grasp the intentions and capabilities of
Japan’s neighboring countries is more crucial than ever.
To this end, Japan will reinforce the analysis capabilities
mainly of the Defense Intelligence Headquarters
(hereinafter referred to as the “DIH”). Moreover, in
order to respond to Integrated Information Warfare,
including the dissemination of disinformation, Japan
will fundamentally reinforce such efforts, and conduct
information sharing and bilateral/multilateral exercises
with its ally, and like-minded countries and others.

**6 Mobile Deployment Capabilities / Civil**
**Protection**


In response to an invasion of Japan including its remote
islands, Japan needs to ensure that deployed units are
always operational and that necessary units are swiftly


-----

maneuvered and deployed according to situations
to secure maritime and air superiority and disrupt
the access/landing of units invading Japan. For this
purpose, Japan will make maximum use of civilian
transportations, while reinforcing maritime and air
transport capabilities of the SDF. In addition, in order
to enable smooth and effective operation of SDF units,
Japan will expand airport and seaport facilities usage
and improve logistics capabilities from peacetime. The
SDF will not only defeat the infringements upon remote
islands but also carry out civil protection missions by
utilizing its reinforced mobile deployment capabilities
for evacuating residents. To this end, by FY2027,
Japan will reinforce its transportation capabilities by
measures such as expanding the use of Private Finance
Initiative (hereinafter referred to as the “PFI”) vessels.
By approximately ten years from now, Japan will
have further reinforced its transport capabilities and
accelerated transport and replenishment through the
improvement of supply bases.

Training using PFI vessels


**7 Sustainability and Resiliency**

In order to defend Japan in the future, the current
warfighting sustainability of the SDF is not necessarily
sufficient in terms of ammunition and fuel, and the
number of operationally available equipment. Therefore,
Japan will improve ammunition production capacity,
secure ammunition storage commensurate with the
amount of ammunition produced, promptly acquire
necessary and sufficient ammunition and fuel, and
establish a system to improve the operational rates of
equipment. To this end, by FY2027, Japan will acquire
necessary ammunition and install more ammunition
storage facilities. Furthermore, Japan will resolve parts
shortages and ensure that all equipment except that under
planned maintenance is operationally available. By
approximately ten years from now, Japan will complete
the installation of further ammunition storage facilities
and maintain appropriate inventory of ammunition and
parts.
Furthermore, in order to ensure the safety of SDF
personnel on a daily basis and prevent an easy loss
of operational capabilities even in a contingency,
Japan will promote measures such as making major
command headquarters underground and reinforcing
their structures, relocate facilities, and steadily construct
barracks and housing and maintain aging buildings. In
addition, the issue of climate change will further impact
future MOD/SDF operations, including various plans,
which demand Japan to deal with a variety of issues.
To this end, by FY2027, Japan will promote measures
to construct underground command headquarters, and
relocate and consolidate facilities in major bases and
camps to improve the resiliency of respective facilities.
By approximately ten years from now, Japan will have
further improved the resiliency of defense facilities.
Lastly, Japan will also strengthen medical functions to
enhance the warfighting sustainability of SDF personnel.

Additionally, Japan will place emphasis on the defense
production and technology bases, characterized as a
virtually integral part of defense capability itself, as well
as areas such as the human resource base that supports
our defense capability.
Secondly, in procuring equipment, the MOD/SDF
will properly combine the introduction of new, high
performance equipment, along with life extension and
improvement of existing equipment, to efficiently secure
necessary and sufficient quantity and quality of defense
capability. In this regard, the MOD/SDF will strengthen
its project management throughout its equipment lifecycle and reduce the life-cycle costs to improve costeffectiveness. In addition, by using advanced civilian
technologies and other means, the MOD/SDF will
steadily realize acceleration of defense equipment
deployment for areas that could directly affect the SDF’s
current and future ways of warfare and are particularly
urgent and significant from a policy perspective.
Furthermore, the MOD/SDF will comprehensively
promote various measures to reinforce the human
resource base, such as strengthening recruitment efforts,
utilizing SDF Reserve Personnel and others, promoting
women’s participation, utilizing diverse and highquality personnel, improving the living and working
environments, developing human resources, and
improving their treatment.


Moreover, to further reinforce the joint deterrence
capabilities of Japan and the United States in an
integrated manner, Japan will promote cooperation,
improved interoperability, etc. related to cross-domain
operations. In order to reinforce the infrastructure to
support effective joint response capabilities, Japan will
also reinforce efforts related to information security
and cybersecurity, as well as defense equipment and
technology cooperation. In addition, measures to support
the stationing of U.S. Forces in Japan will be steadily
implemented. Furthermore, in line with the vision of
the Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP), to strategically
promote multifaceted and multilayered security
operations, Japan will further promote establishing policy
frameworks, while also promoting defense cooperation
and exchanges including bilateral/multilateral training
and exercises and defense equipment and technology
cooperation.
Lastly, in fundamentally reinforcing defense
capabilities, Japan will, while adhering to the scrapand-build approach, optimize the SDF’s organization
and authorized strength as well as equipment. We will
also further our ongoing efforts toward more efficient
procurement, which have achieved significant cost
reductions. In addition, to account for Japan’s aging
population with a declining birth rate, Japan will robustly
promote automation, labor-saving and optimization.

**Major Programs regarding the SDF’s Capabilities**
**3**


In order for Japan to build up defense capabilities to
the point at which Japan is able to take the primary
responsibility for dealing with invasions against its
nation, and disrupt and defeat such threats while gaining
support of its ally and others by FY2027, Japan will
place emphasis on implementing seven major programs.
They encompass mainly the following.

**1 Stand-off Defense Capabilities**


approximately ten years from now, Japan will secure the
required and sufficient quantities of stand-off missiles
with longer ranges and more effective flying forms.
In addition, in order to ensure the effectiveness of
stand-off defense capabilities, the MOD/SDF will
enhance functions of information collection and
analysis as well as command and control, using satellite
constellations and introducing unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAV) and target observation rounds, etc. Since the
operation of these stand-off missiles requires a series of
command and control, including the collection of target
information and the assignment of targets to each unit
to be conducted in a unified manner, a posture based on
joint operation will be established.


Japan will reinforce capabilities to conduct diverse
responses from outside of the threat envelope and
against vessels and other forces invading Japan. To
this end, by FY2027, Japan will acquire practical
operational capability while encouraging the defense
industry to expand its domestic manufacturing capacity
and accelerating R&D and mass production By

will be further improved in order to increase crossdomain capabilities, including the operation of stand-off
missiles. Additionally, in view of the growing threats
to the stable use of the space domain, the SDF will
further enhance its capability to disrupt C4I and other
capabilities of the opponent. Moreover, the MOD/SDF
will enhance the capability for Space Domain Awareness
(SDA). By approximately ten years from now, the MOD/
SDF will further enhance its space operation capabilities
by increasing multi-layering and redundancy in space
use and also by acquiring new space capabilities.
In the cyber domain, by FY2027, the MOD/SDF will
establish a cybersecurity posture to secure command and
control capabilities and high-priority equipment systems
even under cyberattacks and to support cyber defense
of the defense industry. By approximately ten years
from now, the MOD/SDF will establish a cybersecurity
posture to secure command and control capabilities and
force projection capabilities to assure the SDF’s ability
to perform its missions even under cyberattacks, while
reinforcing its posture to support cybersecurity of entities
other than the SDF. Furthermore, efforts to develop
capability to disrupt the opponent’s use of cyberspace
for an attack against Japan will be strengthened. In
order to strengthen the capability to implement these
initiatives as an organization as a whole, the number of
cyber personnel belonging to cyber-related units such
as the SDF Cyber Defense Command will be expanded
to approximately 4,000 by the end of FY2027, and the
MOD/SDF will provide training to its personnel engaged
in cyber-related tasks such as system procurement,
maintenance, and operations. In addition to the increase
of cyber personnel belonging to cyber-related units, these
efforts will bring the total number of MOD/SDF cyber
personnel to approximately 20,000 by around FY2027.
Further reinforcement of cyber defense architecture is
intended in the future.
In the domain of electromagnetic spectrum, by
FY2027, the MOD/SDF will accelerate programs,
which are already underway to acquire means and
improve capability, etc. and enhance communication
and radar jamming capabilities that lower the opponent’s
command-and-control functions. In addition, the MOD/
SDF will take measures for early deployment of directed
energy technologies for responding to small UAVs, etc.
By approximately ten years from now, the MOD/SDF will
steadily upgrade assets with superior electronic warfare
capabilities and enhance capabilities for responding to


**2 Integrated Air and Missile Defense**
**Capabilities**


By FY2027, the MOD/SDF will procure Aegis System
Equipped Vessels. In addition, it will enhance capabilities
to detect and track threats including Hypersonic Glide
Vehicles (HGV) by improving the capabilities of existing
assets, such as upgrading the surface-to-air guided
missile PATRIOT system and introducing a new radar
(LTAMDS), while developing capabilities to deal with
small UAVs, etc. By approximately ten years from now,
Japan will further enhance capabilities to detect and track
threats using shooters, etc. that respond to HGVs in the
gliding phase, as well as acquire capabilities to deal with
small UAVs, etc. through full-scale introduction of nonkinetic interception means. Furthermore, various assets
will be connected by a network to realize efficient combat.
In doing the above, Japan will leverage stand-off
defense capability and other capabilities to conduct
effective counterstrikes against the opponent’s territory
(counterstrike capabilities) as a minimum necessary
measure for self-defense to prevent ballistic missile and
other attacks.

**3 Unmanned Defense Capabilities**


**Part**
**Ⅱ**

**Chapter**


In order to accomplish missions while minimizing human
loss, by FY2027, the SDF will expeditiously procure,
by leasing and other means, domestic and overseas
unmanned assets (equipment), such as existing UAVs
and unmanned ground vehicles (UGV), as well as carry
out operational verifications and reinforce the SDF’s
practical capability to operate unmanned equipment,
promoting initiatives to optimize the existing equipment
system and personnel deployment. By approximately
ten years from now, Japan will further materialize the
style of warfare using unmanned assets, accelerate the
development and introduction of equipment based on
the geographical characteristics of Japan, and expand
full-scale operation. Furthermore, the SDF will develop
the ability to simultaneously control multiple unmanned
assets using systems such as AI.

taking all possible measures to ensure the safety of
training, the MOD/SDF will give due consideration to
the surrounding environments of training infrastructures,
including training ranges in Hokkaido and other areas in
Japan.

**2 Reinforcing Coordination and**
**Cooperation with the Japan Coast Guard**


**1 Training and Exercises**

To effectively respond to various contingencies and
enhance the deterrence effectiveness, the MOD/SDF will
conduct bilateral and multilateral training and exercises
with like-minded countries and others, in addition to
the SDF’s joint training and exercises and Japan-U.S.
bilateral training and exercises, in a planned and visible
way to demonstrate Japan’s intention and capability
not to tolerate unilateral changes to the status quo by
force and such attempts, including seeking to enhance
and strengthen training and exercises as FDO which are
flexibly implemented according to the situation.
In addition, to maximize the capabilities of SDF
units in a contingency, the MOD/SDF will expand the
establishment and utilization of training areas and other
facilities in Hokkaido and other areas in Japan, and
steadily establish and enhance the necessary training
infrastructure in Japan. In addition to expanding the joint/
shared use of U.S. military facilities and areas by Japan
and the United States and the use of civilian airport and
seaport facilities, the MOD/SDF will enhance training
for rapid deployment of its units to islands such as those
in the southwestern region, joint training, and civil
protection training, etc., with relevant organizations such
as the police, Japan Coast Guard, firefighting services
and local governments to appropriately respond to
infringements that do not amount to armed attacks from
outside as well as armed attacks in the vicinity of remote
islands.
In order to expand such training, it is necessary to
obtain the understanding and cooperation of related


The MOD/SDF will deepen the information sharing
and coordination mechanism with Japan Coast Guard,
as well as enhance various response procedures and
training, including developing procedures to have the
Minister of Defense control the Japan Coast Guard in
an armed attack situation and conducting joint training.

**3 Collaboration with Local Communities**


Japan will actively engage in public relations activities
regarding the policies and activities of the MOD/SDF
and also the role of the U.S. Forces in Japan on a regular
basis, and coordinate to accommodate the requests and
situations of the local communities, while fulfilling
accountability.
The MOD/SDF will give due consideration to
the characteristics of the regions in order to gain
understanding of the local governments and residents
upon reorganization of units as well as placement and
operation of SDF camps and bases.

functions as an intellectual base.
In addition, the MOD/SDF will promote various
measures to enhance its ability to disseminate information,
such as disseminating information efficiently and reliably
to improve the public’s accessibility to research findings
that contribute to promoting security education. They
include dispatching lecturers to educational institutions
and enhancing public symposiums so that citizens can
accurately recognize knowledge and information on
security policy. In addition, in order to further strengthen
the research and education functions of the MOD/SDF,
centering on National Institute for Defense Studies, the
MOD/SDF will expand networks and organizational
collaboration with domestic and foreign research and
education institutions, universities, think tanks, and
other organizations.

**Measures for International Security Cooperation**

**1 Response to Large-Scale Disasters**


In the event of various types of disasters including
natural disasters such as the Nankai Trough Earthquake,
nuclear disasters, and other special disasters, the MOD/
SDF will take all possible measures to ensure initial
response promptly by transferring and deploying units
of sufficient scale, while maintaining joint operations as
the basis of its operations. At the same time, measures
will be taken to strengthen the response posture, such
as the procurement of UAVs (near-field) and helicopter
satellite communication systems (helicopter SATs).
In addition, in close coordination and cooperation
with related ministries and agencies, local governments,
and other entities, the MOD/SDF will promote various
measures such as conducting various training and
exercises, formulating plans, and securing alternative
functions and deployment infrastructure in the event of
a disaster.


Based on the vision of a FOIP, the MOD/SDF will promote
efforts such as port calls by naval vessels and aircraft
on various occasions with other countries that share
awareness of maritime security and the use of airspace
based on existing international rules, such as through
joint training and exercises. In this way, the MOD/SDF
will actively and visibly demonstrate its willingness and
capability for the stability of the maritime order and the
use of the airspace based on existing international rules.

**3 International Peace Cooperation Activities**


In line with the Legislation for Peace and Security, Japan
will continue to promote international peace cooperation
activities, considering all the factors involved such as
the mission objectives, situation in host country, and
political and economic relations between Japan and


-----

host countries. In particular, Japan will actively promote
activities such as dispatch of embedded personnel to
mission headquarters, capacity building related to UN
PKO, and dispatch of staff members to UN headquarters.
In addition, for further support for the international
activities including rescue and transportation of Japanese
nationals overseas, the Central Readiness Regiment
and the International Operations Training Unit will be
integrated into a new international operations force with
high readiness and technical capabilities in the fields
including facilities and unmanned aircraft operation, etc.


Additionally, while expanding in the curriculum of the
Japan Peacekeeping Training and Research Center, the
MOD/SDF will leverage the Center’s expertise to provide
educational opportunities to not only SDF personnel but
also other personnel from various backgrounds.
Regarding the SDF’s operation facility in Djibouti, the
MOD/SDF will promote renewal/upgrade to ensure its
long term and stable utilization for security cooperation,
including rescue and transportation of Japanese nationals
overseas in the Middle East and Africa.

The MOD/SDF will incorporate advanced civilian
technologies and steadily realize acceleration of defense
equipment deployment which is particularly urgent
and significant from a policy perspective in such areas
as stand-off defense capabilities and AI. To this end,

next ten years.

cybersecurity, making supply chains more resilient, and
business succession.


While Japan’s defense industry is responsible for each
stage of the equipment life cycle, the equipment and
defense industry are inseparable. In this context, the
defense production and technology bases are a virtually
integral part of defense capability itself. Conversely, for
companies, defense industry is less attractive: the business
requires a large investment of management resources
to meet sophisticated performance requirements and
information security measures, while profitability is low
and sales channels are limited to the SDF. Moreover,
issues have become apparent, such as a weakened
domestic manufacturing structure as shown by companies’
withdrawal from the defense business, aging manufacturing
facilities, supply chain risks, and the threat of cyberattacks.
In order to address these issues, the MOD/SDF will
make the defense business more attractive by ensuring
appropriate company profits, etc. In order to cope with
various risks and maintain and strengthen the bases,
appropriate fiscal measures and financial support will
be provided for companies’ initiatives such as upgrading
manufacturing and other facilities strengthening


**2 Reinforcing Defense Technology Base**

The MOD/SDF will realize acceleration of defense
equipment development through various efforts
concerning R&D by identifying specific projects
necessary for future warfare and organizing the entire
picture up to the acquisition. Based on the integrated
equipment system, which is systematically organized
for future battles from the viewpoint of joint operations,
the MOD/SDF will intensively invest in equipment/
technology fields that are directly linked to future battles,
such as stand-off defense capabilities, capabilities to
respond to HGVs, etc., capabilities to respond to drones
and swarm attacks, unmanned assets, and measures for
next-generation fighter aircraft. Furthermore, the MOD/
SDF will improve the efficiency of the R&D process,
including improving the capabilities of conventional
equipment. It will also introduce a new agile
methodology that quickly deploys prototypes to units
and makes improvements to perfect equipment while


-----

obtaining operational feedback, rather than adopting
the conventional waterfall methodology of moving
through the phases step by step while repeating design
and testing based on performance requirements. Doing
so will shorten the time required for R&D and accelerate
defense equipment deployment.
In order to secure technological superiority in
the future and realize advanced capabilities ahead
of other countries, the MOD/SDF will pursue and
implement technological cooperation, including R&D
that incorporates a wide range of advanced civilian
technologies as well as international joint R&D to
leverage overseas technologies. At the same time, the
MOD/SDF will invest heavily in technologies that can
be directly linked to defense applications, aiming to
acquire technologies at an early stage.

In order to implement the above policies, in addition to
necessary budgetary measures and legislation, financing
will be provided for projects with a high policy nature
through the use of government financial institutions,

**Strengthening the Foundation for SDF Personnel to Fulfill Abilities as**
**1111**
**Core of Defense Capabilities**


For reinforcing the SDF’s human resource base, by FY2027,
the MOD/SDF will secure the necessary number of talents
from a wide range of sources, including the private sector.
The MOD/SDF will also strengthen education and research
on cyber and other domains, joint operations training,
and medical training. Furthermore, new measures will be
established based on the findings of the MOD Committee
of Experts on Harassment Prevention and Measures and
other reviews, and ensure that all SDF personnel are fully
aware of them. In addition, the MOD/SDF will constantly
review its measures to ensure that they are in line with the
times and develop an organizational environment of zero
tolerance for harassment. Moreover, the living and working
environments and treatment of SDF personnel will be
improved by taking measures against aging barracks and
housing and eliminating equipment shortages.
By approximately ten years from now, the MOD/SDF
will continuously and stably secure the necessary human
resources including those with specialized knowledge


and skills, and foster an organizational environment in
which all personnel can demonstrate their individual
abilities while maintaining high morale. For the
transformation of the medical function, the MOD/SDF
will build a posture to mobilize the full strength of the
SDF’s medical force and promote fundamental reforms
to improve combat trauma care capabilities.

**Optimization Efforts**
**1212**

The MOD/SDF will eliminate or reduce equipment
based on the changes in the character of warfare,
as well as reduce the number of manned equipment
by accelerating the introduction of labor-saving and
automated equipment. Further efforts for effective and
efficient acquisition of equipment include cost reduction
through planned and stable acquisition of equipment
by expanding the application of long-term contracts,
procurement in consideration of the supply-demand
situation of equipment including that of other countries,
and narrowing down SDF-unique specifications that
cause costs to rise, which will enhance the effectiveness


of project management throughout the equipment life
cycle.
In addition, during the buildup period, a significant
increase in personnel will be required in the cyber, space,
and other areas. To meet this demand, it is essential that
the MOD take bold steps to optimize the allocation
of resources amid the extremely difficult recruitment
environment. To this end, the current total capacity of
SDF personnel (247,000) will not be increased, but
optimization measures will be taken, such as reviewing
existing units and using outside labor force such as
private-sector contractors.

The expenditure aiming for the implementation of
defense capability buildup described in this program for
the next five years from FY2023 to FY2027 amount to
approximately ¥43 trillion.
The annual defense budgets for FY2023 to FY2027
under this program amount to approximately ¥40,500
billion in total (approximately ¥8,900 billion in FY2027),
on the assumption that the following measures will be
taken.
(1) Considering the progress of each project, further
accelerate the improvement of SDF facilities in an
agile and flexible manner (approximately ¥1,600
billion);
(2) Utilize settlement surplus in the general account when
the surplus is larger than the expected settlement
surplus (approximately ¥900 billion). The MOD/
SDF will secure financial resources virtually such as
by thoroughly implementing further optimization and


rationalization of defense buildup.
The expenses based on contracts (material expenses)
to be newly concluded to implement this program amount
to approximately ¥43,500 billion (excluding the amount
corresponding to payments for the period outside of the
program that contribute to improving project efficiency,
such as maintenance), and the future obligation for each
fiscal year is to be managed appropriately.
In addition, to secure financial resources for the
stable sustainment of defense capabilities after FY2027
as well as for covering this program from FY2023 to
FY2027, necessary measures will be implemented in
both expenditure and revenue areas, such as the reform
in government expenditure, using settlement surplus,
creation of defense buildup funds utilizing non-tax
revenues, and tax measures.

be used to expedite improvements of the resiliency
of SDF facilities. In particular, measures will be
implemented with an intensive focus on reinforcing
the SDF’s infrastructure base (airfields, ports, etc.) as
well as earthquake proofing and addressing the aging
of SDF facilities (buildings, etc.) based on the “Actions
Based on the Five-Year Acceleration Measures for
Disaster Prevention, Mitigation, and Building National

procurement of equipment and others. Material expenses
are further classified into “obligatory outlay expenses,”[4]
which are paid based on contracts concluded in previous
fiscal years, and “general material expenses,” which are
paid under current-year contracts. Material expenses are
also referred to as “program expenses,” and since general
material expenses include repair costs for equipment,
education and training expenses for personnel, and the
purchase of fuel, they are referred to also as “activity
expenses.”
Personnel and food provision expenses as well as
obligatory outlay expenses, both of which are mandatory
expenses, account for 70% of the total defense-related
budget. The remaining 30% of the budget includes
spending for repairing equipment and for implementing
measures to mitigate the impact on local communities


hosting U.S. bases in Japan. As such, a high percentage
of the budget is allocated for maintenance purposes.

See Fig. II-4-3-9 (Relationship between Annual Expenditure and

Future Obligation Concerning New Contracts)

**2 Classification by purpose of use**


Defense-related expenditures are broadly classified into
“personnel and food provision expenses,” which cover
items such as wages and meals for SDF personnel;
“equipment procurement expenses,” which cover the
procurement of new equipment (e.g., tanks, destroyers,
fighter aircraft, etc.); “maintenance expenses,” which
cover items such as training and education of SDF
personnel, fuel for vessels and aircraft, and equipment
repairs; “facility improvement expenses,” which cover


Some projects for the buildup of defense capabilities extend over multiple years. In these cases, the fiscal year in which the contract is concluded is different from the fiscal year in which the payment
to the contractor is made. Therefore, the maximum obligation over later fiscal years is first allocated to the budget as a contract resulting in a Treasury obligation (a type of budget that only grants the
authority to incur obligations; the contracts can be concluded, but payment cannot be made). Based on such budgeting, in the fiscal year in which the construction is completed or the equipment is
procured, the expenses necessary for payment are in principle allocated as a budget expenditure (a type of budget that grants the authority to incur obligations and to make payment; the contracts
can be concluded and payment can be made). Budget expenditure for payments incurred under contracts concluded in previous fiscal years is called “obligatory outlay expenses,” while expenditure
for future fiscal years is termed “future obligation.”

For cases where a continued project over multiple years is necessary, there is also a system of continuing expenditure as a means to grant the authority to incur obligations and make payment over

and barracks; and “research and development expenses,”
which cover investments in cutting-edge technologies.
In the defense-related expenditures for FY2023, the
combined total of expenditures for the procurement
of new equipment and for research and development
exceeds 20%, while the percentage of expenditures
for the maintenance of existing equipment has also
increased. For reference, North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) member countries have aimed to
allocate at least 20% of their respective defense budget
to the procurement of major equipment and related
research and development by 2024.

**3 Future obligation concerning new**
**contracts**

Apart from the annual budget expenditure, the future
obligation concerning new contracts (the new future
obligation arising in the applicable fiscal year) indicates
payments for the following year and beyond. In the
build-up of defense capabilities, it is common to take
multiple years from contract to delivery or completion,
in areas such as the procurement of vessels, aircraft, and
other primary equipment, as well as the construction
of buildings such as aircraft hangars and barracks.
Concerning these projects, while contracts covering
multiple fiscal years are concluded in the applicable
fiscal year, payments for the next fiscal year and beyond

Future obligation

When improving defense capabilities, it is common for work in areas like the
procurement of equipment and the upgrading of facilities to be carried out over several
years. Consequently, a procedure is undertaken whereby a contract that extends for
multiple years is arranged (five years in principle), and the government promises in
advance at the time of the agreement to make the payment at a fixed time in the future.
Future obligation refers to the sum of money to be paid in the following year and beyond
under such contracts, which extend for multiple years.

**Optimization Efforts**
**4**


In the DBP, substantive funds will be secured by
means such as thoroughly ensuring greater efficiency
and streamlining of the buildup of defense capability.
The FY2023 budget aims to realize a cost reduction of
approximately ¥257.2 billion by suspending the operation
of equipment of declining importance, leveraging longterm contracts, and optimizing procurement through
greater scrutiny of costs. Concrete initiatives introduced
in the FY2023 budget are as follows.
・The operation of equipment of declining importance
due to obsolescence, etc., will be suspended and its use
terminated. (cost reduction of ¥5.2 billion)
・Prices and procurement costs will be reduced by
enhancing predictability and encouraging efficient
production by companies through the bulk purchase of
equipment, including through long-term contracts. At


the same time, Performance Based Logistics (PBL), in
which consideration for the equipment is linked to the
maintenance outcomes achieved, and other umbrella
contracts will be expanded. (cost reduction of ¥145.6
billion)
・Procurement time and life cycle costs will be reduced
by narrowing down the SDF’s proprietary specifications
through modularization, communalization, and the use
of civilian goods. (cost reduction of ¥21.4 billion)
・In addition to reviewing projects with low costeffectiveness, the cost of each project will be carefully
managed, and the utilization of external personnel from
private contractors will be expanded. (cost reduction of
¥84.9 billion)

**Comparison with Other Countries**
**5**

It is not possible to accurately compare the amounts
of defense budget of countries due to a number of
factors: there is no internationally unified definition of
defense budget in the first place; even if defense budget
were publicly disclosed, their overall amount or their
breakdown is sometimes unclear; and the budget system
varies by country.
On such basis, if Japan’s defense-related expenditures
and the defense budget of other countries officially
published by each government were converted into
dollar amounts using the purchasing power parity[5] of
each country reported by the Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD), the results
would be as shown in Fig. II-4-3-11 (Comparison with
Defense Budget of Major Countries [FY2022]).
NATO member countries and other countries have
committed to spending under their defense budget
that is commensurate with their respective economic
capabilities in order to maintain the security environment.
In the case of Japan, looking at its defense budget as
a percentage of GDP has a certain significance as an
indicator for the reinforcement of its defense capabilities
in light of changes in the security environment within
the international community. In addition to the programs
aimed at the fundamental reinforcement of defense
capabilities, Japan will supplement these efforts by
reinforcing its comprehensive architecture for national
defense through spending targeted at the JCG’s
capabilities and PKO, research and development, the
development of public infrastructure, etc. The necessary
measures will be adopted to ensure that the combined
budget level for the fundamental reinforcement of
defense capabilities and other supplementary measures
reaches 2% of Japan’s current GDP in FY2022 by
FY2027.
In addition, Fig. II-4-3-12 (Changes in Defense
Budget of Major Countries) shows the trends in the
defense budget of major countries since 1998.

country (DoD budget for the United States) and are converted to US
dollars, using each country’s purchasing power parity for FY2022 as
published by the OECD (officially published rate as of April 2023).

2 The amounts of defense budget published by China appear to be only
part of its actual expenses for military purpose. According to analysis from
the U.S. Department of Defense, China’s actual military-related spending
could be significantly higher than its officially announced defense budget.
3 The percentage of GDP is calculated based on defense budget officially
published by each country (in local currency) using the GDP of each
country published by the IMF (in local currency).
4 As defense budget published by NATO (which include pensions for retired
veterans, etc.) may differ from those officially published by each country,
the percentage of GDP based on defense budget published by NATO (in
March 2023) does not necessarily coincide with the percentage of GDP
calculated based on defense budget officially published by each country.
5 Defense budget per person are calculated using the populations
published by the UNFPA (State of the World Population 2022).
6 According to a SIPRI Fact Sheet (published in April 2023), global defense
budget represented 2.2% of global GDP in 2022, and defense budget
represented 1.1% of Japan’s GDP.

from a military expert’s perspective. The Ground Staff,
Maritime Staff and Air Staff are the staff organizations
for the Minister of Defense concerning their respective
services except operations of the SDF, with the Chiefs
of Staff for the Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF), the
Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) and the Air SelfDefense Force (ASDF) acting as the top ranking expert
advisers to the Minister of Defense regarding these
services.
In this manner, the MOD has ensured that the support
for the Minister from a policy perspective and the support
for the Minister from a military expert’s perspective are
provided in a well-balanced manner like the two wheels
of a cart, so to speak, in order for the Minister of Defense
to appropriately make decisions.

The Minister of Defense takes charge of and manages
the matters related to the defense of Japan as the
competent minister, and is in overall charge of the SDF
duties in accordance with the provisions of the SDF
Law. The Minister is supported by the State Minister of
Defense, the Parliamentary Vice-Ministers of Defense
(two), and the Senior Adviser to the Minister of Defense.
There are also the Special Advisers to the Minister of
Defense, who advise the Minister of Defense, and the
Defense Council, which deliberates on basic principles
concerning affairs under the Ministry’s jurisdiction.
Furthermore, there are the Administrative ViceMinister of Defense, who organizes and supervises the
administrative affairs of each bureau and organization to
support the Minister of Defense, and the Vice-Minister of
Defense for International Affairs, who is responsible for
the overall coordination of duties such as those related to
international affairs.
Moreover, the Internal Bureaus of the MOD, Joint
Staff, Ground Staff Office, Maritime Staff Office,
Air Staff Office, and the Acquisition, Technology &
Logistics Agency (ATLA), as an external bureau, have
been established in the MOD. The Internal Bureaus of
the MOD are responsible for basic policy relating to the
duties of the SDF. The Minister’s Secretariat and the
Directors-General of each Bureau within the Internal
Bureaus, along with the Commissioner of ATLA who is
in charge of defense equipment administration, support
the Minister of Defense by providing assistance from a
policy perspective.

**Responses to Situations that Will Have an Important Influence**
**2**


The Law Concerning Measures to Ensure the Peace and
Security of Japan in Situations that Will Have an Important
Influence on Japan’s Peace and Security[7] aims to strengthen
cooperation with foreign countries to respond to situations
that will have an important influence on Japan’s peace and
security (i.e., situations that may result in a direct armed
attack on Japan if left unchecked) by carrying out measures
such as logistics support activities and thereby contributing
to the peace and security of Japan in the event of such
situations. The Law provides the coverage and response
measures as follows:

**1 Coverage**


have an important influence on Japan’s peace and security,
which the SDF may support, are “U.S. Armed Forces
engaged in activities contributing to the achievement of the
objectives of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty,” “armed forces
of other foreign countries engaged in activities contributing
to the achievement of the objectives of the UN Charter” and
“other similar organizations.”

**2 Response Measures to Situations that**
**Will Have an Important Influence on**
**Japan’s Peace and Security**


Measures for responding to situations that will have an
important influence on Japan’s peace and security are:
(1) logistics support activities, (2) search and rescue

to continue search and rescue activities as long as the
safety of these units is ensured.

-  the commanding officers of the SDF units order a
temporary suspension of activities if acts of combat
operations occur or are expected to occur at or near the
site of their activities.

-  the Minister of Defense designates the area for the
activities, and if changes the area or order to suspend
the activities it is deemed difficult to carry out
activities smoothly and safely in all or part of the area,
the Minister must promptly change the designation of
the area or order the cessation of the activities being
implemented there.

**4 Relationship between Situations that**
**Will Have an Important Influence**
**on Japan’s Peace and Security and**
**Survival-Threatening Situations**


**Part**
**Ⅱ**

**Chapter**


While both situations that will have an important
influence on Japan’s peace and security and survivalthreatening situations are different legal concepts that
are determined separately based on the requirements
set forth in the respective laws, they share common
requirements such as the likelihood that Japan may be
embroiled in a war and the extent of damage that may be
suffered by Japanese nationals. In other words, survivalthreatening situations may be conceptually subsumed
under situations that will have an important influence
on Japan’s peace and security. Accordingly, depending
on how a situation evolves, a situation that will have an
important influence on Japan’s peace and security may
also satisfy the requirements of a survival-threatening
situation and be determined as such.

The following measures are set forth in order to avoid
integration with the use of force by a foreign country and
also to ensure the safety of SDF personnel:

-  Japan does not implement support activities in
the scene where a combat is actually taking place.
Regarding search and rescue operations, however,
when stranded personnel have been located and rescue
operations have commenced, the SDF units are allowed

Article 76 of the SDF Law
(Issuance of Defense Operations Orders)


Concept of ensuring civilian control of the military

-  Response against ballistic missiles requires the government to assess the possibility of missiles flying toward Japan by comprehensively analyzing and evaluating the specific
situation and international circumstances. In addition to the SDF destroying the missile, interagency actions are required, for example, measures for civil protection such as alert and
evacuation, diplomatic activities, information gathering by related agencies, and enhancement of readiness for emergencies.

-  In view of the importance of the matter and the necessity of action by the Japanese government as a whole, the Cabinet and Minister of Defense can sufficiently fulfill their
responsibilities upon the Prime Minister’s approval (Cabinet decision) and orders by the Minister of Defense. Furthermore, the supervision of the Diet is also defined with a provision in
the law stipulating reporting to the Diet.


**Maintenance of Public Order and Responses to Aggression that Do Not**

**1 Public Security Operations**

**(1) Public Security Operations by Order**
In the event of an indirect aggression or another
emergency situation, the Prime Minister can order
the whole or part of the SDF to deploy if it is deemed
impossible to maintain public security with the general
police force. In this instance, in principle, the Prime
Minister must bring the order to the Diet for deliberation,
and request for its approval within twenty days from the
day the order has been given.


**2 Maritime Security Operations**

When there is a special need to protect lives or property
or maintain public security at sea, the Minister of Defense
can order the SDF units to take necessary actions at sea
upon approval by the Prime Minister.


See


Part III, Chapter 1, Section 3-2 (Measures against Violations of
Japan’s Sovereignty)


**3 Counter-Piracy Operations**


When there is a special need to respond to acts of piracy,
the Minister of Defense may order SDF units to conduct
operations to deal with piracy acts at sea upon approval
by the Prime Minister.

See Part III, Chapter 3, Section 2-2 (Counter-Piracy Operations)

**4 Destruction Measures against Ballistic**
**Missiles or Other Objects**


**(2) Public Security Operations by Request**
Upon consulting with the Public Safety Commission of
the prefecture concerned, the governor of that prefecture
can request the Prime Minister to dispatch units, etc., of
the SDF if it is deemed unavoidable as the situation will
have a serious influence on public security. Following
such a request, the Prime Minister can order the SDF to
mobilize when a situation calls for such action.

Guerillas and Special Operations Forces)


In cases where ballistic missiles or other objects are
flying to Japan as an armed attack or flying to Japan in
a Survival Threatening Situation and where the “Three


-----

Conditions are met, the SDF can respond with the
defense operation. In cases where ballistic missiles or
other objects are flying to Japan but which are not found
as an armed attack, the Minister of Defense can take the
following measures:
(1) If the Minister of Defense judges that ballistic
missiles or other objects are likely to fly to Japan
and that it is necessary to prevent damage to human
lives and property due to its fall in the territory of
Japan, the Minister, upon the approval of the Prime
Minister, can order the SDF units to take measures to
destroy the ballistic missiles or other objects actually
flying to the country in the airspace over the territory
of Japan or the high seas.
(2) In addition to the cases of (1) above, there may be
cases where the situation suddenly changes with little
information available on the launch, for example, and
the Minister of Defense cannot have time to obtain
approval from the Prime Minister. In preparation for
such cases, the Minister of Defense may create an
emergency response manual beforehand and obtain
approval from the Prime Minister. Following the
emergency response manual, the Minister of Defense
can order, for a specified period of time, the SDF
units to take measures to destroy ballistic missiles
or other objects in the airspace over the territory of
Japan or the high seas when such objects are actually
flying to the country.

**6 Rescue and Transportation of Japanese**
**Nationals Overseas**

The Minister of Defense can transport Japanese nationals
and others in need of life or physical protection to a safe
area if requested by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in
the event of emergency situation in a foreign country.
Considering the experiences including the transport of
Japanese nationals from Afghanistan in August 2021,
the SDF Law was amended in 2022 (enacted and put
into force in April 2022); this amendment removed
the restriction on the means of transportation which
required to use the government aircraft and reviewed
the safety requirements for implementation. In addition,
the scope of transportation recipients was expanded to
include some foreign nationals who are (1) spouses and
children of Japanese nationals, (2) honorary consulsgeneral, honorary consuls, and local personnel of
overseas diplomatic missions, and (3) local employees
of independent administrative institutions.
The Minister of Defense can also “rescue” Japanese
nationals and others by protecting or recovering them
upon request from and consultation with the Minister for
Foreign Affairs if there is a threat of harm to life or body
and all of the following are satisfied;

**7 Asset Protection for the U.S Forces and**
**Other Forces**


The Minister of Defense may order SDF units to take
the necessary measures to make the intruding aircraft
land or withdraw from the territorial airspace of Japan
(by guiding intruders away, issuing radio transmission
warnings, using weapons, etc.) when a foreign aircraft
intrudes Japan’s territorial airspace in violation of
international law, the provisions of the Aviation Law, or
other relevant laws and regulations.

may protect weapons and other equipment of the units
of the U.S. Forces and other forces currently engaged
in activities that contribute to the defense of Japan in
cooperation with the SDF. The basic principles of this
Article and the involvement of the Cabinet in applying
this Article are set forth in “The Implementation
Guidelines for Article 95-2 of the Self-Defense Forces
Law”[10] approved by the National Security Council,
which is outlined below:

**(1) Purpose of Article 95-2**
Protection under this Article can be applied to weapons
and other equipment of the units of the U.S. Forces
and other forces, as well as equivalent organizations
currently engaged in activities that contribute to the
defense of Japan in cooperation with the SDF (including
bilateral/multilateral exercises but excluding activities
taking place at the site of actual combat). This Article
allows very passive and limited use of weapons to the
minimum extent necessary to protect important material
means which constitute the defense capability of Japan
from infringements not amounting to an armed attack.


security; and (3) bilateral/multilateral exercises to
enhance capabilities required for defending Japan.

**(3) Decision on Protection Missions**
When the Minister of Defense receives a request from
the U.S. Forces and other forces, the Minister makes an
independent decision whether the relevant activities fall
under “activities that contribute to the defense of Japan”
and whether protection is necessary, by considering
the objective and details of the activities, capability of
the unit, and surrounding circumstances as well as the
impacts on the SDF’s regular duties.


**Part**
**Ⅱ**

**Chapter**


**(4) Involvement of the Cabinet**
Requests for protection from the U.S. Forces and other
forces should be deliberated by the NSC prior to the
decision by the Minister of Defense in the following
cases. However, in urgent cases, the Minister should
promptly report to the NSC.
(1) First request from the U.S Forces and other forces.
(2) The request for protection in the territory of a third
country.
(3) Other requests deemed particularly important.
In addition, in case protection is necessary under the
situations that have an important influence, the necessity
should be approved by the Cabinet following the inclusion
in the Basic Plan and the deliberation by the NSC.

See Part III, Chapter 1, Section 8-2 (Track Record of Asset

Protection for the U.S. Forces and Other Forces (SDF Law
Article 95-2)); Reference 23 (Track Record of Asset Protection
for the U.S. Forces and Other Forces (SDF Law Article 95-2))


**(2) Activities that Contribute to the Defense of Japan**
“Activities that contribute to the defense of Japan”
are determined on a case-by-case basis and may
include the following: (1) intelligence, surveillance,
and reconnaissance (ISR) activities including ballistic
missile alert; (2) transportation and logistics in situations
that have an important influence on Japan’s peace and

necessary for the SDF to respond to the disaster.[11] This
procedure is based on the idea that prefectural governors
and other officials should grasp the overall conditions of
the disaster and their own disaster relief capabilities first,
and then decide whether to make a request for the SDF
disaster relief dispatch.


**1 Disaster Relief Dispatches**

In principle, a Disaster Relief Dispatch is conducted as
follows: prefectural governors or other officials request
the Minister of Defense, or an officer designated by the
Minister, to dispatch SDF units, etc., in the event of a
natural disaster; the Minister or the designated officer will
make a judgment based on a comprehensive evaluation
of three conditions (urgency, non-substitutability, and

dispatch. With regard to disaster relief dispatch, earthquake disaster prevention dispatch, and nuclear disaster relief dispatch, (1) SDF personnel ordered for the dispatch may take measures such
as evacuation (Article 4 of the Police Duties Execution Law) based on Article 94 of the SDF Law (Authority in Disaster Relief Dispatch, etc.); (2) SDF Reserve Personnel and SDF Ready Reserve
Personnel may be called up for service in the event of disaster relief dispatch, and SDF Ready Personnel in the event of earthquake disaster prevention dispatch or nuclear disaster relief dispatch;

Under the International Peace Support Act,[13] in order to
ensure peace and security of the international community,
Japan can cooperate with or support the armed forces of
other countries engaged in operations for international
peace and security on the occasion of Joint International
Peace Response Situation.[14] From the perspective of
seamless responses to any situation, the International
Peace Support Law, enacted as a general law, allows
Japan to conduct operations more expeditiously and
effectively, making it possible to proactively contribute to
international peace and security on Japan’s own initiative.

**(1) Requirements**
Either of the following UN resolutions (by the General
Assembly or the Security Council) are required for Japan
to cooperate with or support the armed forces of other
countries.
**a. Resolutions that decide, call upon, recommend**
**or authorize the country of support recipient to**
**respond to situations that threaten the peace and**
**security of the international community**
**b. Other than (a), resolutions that acknowledge the**
**situations as a threat to or disruption of peace**
**and call on UN member states to respond to the**
**situations concerned**


**(3) Measures to Avoid Integration with the Use of**
**Force**

The following measures are set forth in order to avoid
integration with the use of force by other countries and
also to ensure the safety of SDF personnel:

-  Japan does not engage in activities in the areas where
a combat is currently taking place. However, when a
victim has already been found and rescue operations
have been commenced, the SDF units are allowed to
continue search and rescue activities as long as their

perspective. If a nation s decision-making process is
opaque, there will always exist conditions under which
threats may materialize.
In order to defend one’s own country from a nation
with powerful military capabilities and the intention to
launch aggression, it is necessary to have deterrence
capabilities that make the other nation realize the
difficulties of achieving unilateral changes to the status
quo by force. It is also necessary to build one’s own
capabilities, namely, defense capabilities, by focusing
on the other nation’s capabilities and ensuring it does not
harbor the intention to commit aggression.
Amid the most challenging and complex security
environment since the start of the postwar period, Japan
will directly face up to the grim reality and fundamentally
reinforce its defense capabilities, with a focus on the
capabilities of its opponents and new ways of warfare,
to protect the lives and peaceful livelihoods of Japanese
nationals.
In light of the above, Japan will fundamentally
reinforce its defense capabilities and further accelerate
its efforts to protect the lives of Japanese nationals and
their peaceful livelihoods from unilateral changes to the
status quo by force and such attempts.

flag operations; the domains of space, cyber, and
electromagnetic spectrum as well as asymmetric means
of attack that leverage unmanned assets; and rhetoric that
could be interpreted as open threats involving the use of
nuclear weapons by nuclear weapon states. Therefore,
Japan’s fundamentally reinforced defense capabilities
must be able to respond to new ways of warfare.
Furthermore, with fundamentally reinforced defense
capabilities, Japan must be able to take primary
responsibility to disrupt and defeat any invasion of
the country, which is a defense objective of Japan. In
light of this, with regard to future defense capabilities,
it is imperative for Japan to focus on the capabilities
and ways of warfare of any opponents, fundamentally
reinforce its capabilities for national defense more than
ever before, and clearly demonstrate its intention to
never tolerate any unilateral changes to the status quo by
force and such attempts at any point in time.
The functions and capabilities necessary to respond to
new ways of warfare set forth in the NDS are as follows.
Firstly, there are (1) stand-off defense capabilities and
(2) integrated air and missile defense capabilities, which
are capabilities that can block and eliminate invading
forces from a long distance. Next, if deterrence were
to fail, in addition to the aforementioned capabilities,
there are (3) unmanned defense capabilities, (4) crossdomain operation capabilities, and (5) command and
control and intelligence-related functions, which enable
gaining superiority and preserving Japan’s asymmetric
edge across various domains. Furthermore, there are (6)
mobile deployment capabilities/civil protection as well
as (7) sustainability and resiliency, which enable Japan
to continue operating swiftly and persistently to crush
any opponent’s will to invade.
Based on the above concepts, capabilities in all
domains, including space, cyber, and the electromagnetic
spectrum, will be organically integrated to fundamentally
reinforce Japan’s Multi-domain Defense Capabilities
that enable the constant and continuous implementation
of flexible and strategic activities at every stage from
peacetime to emergencies.


**Part**

**Chapter**


Japan has been building a Multi-domain Defense Force
capable of conducting flexible and sustained activities
through joint operations while organically integrating
capabilities in the space, cyber, and electromagnetic
spectrum domains with those in ground, maritime, and
air domains.
However, in addition to traditional forms of invasion
through air, sea, and land conducted through now, new
ways of warfare have emerged that combine largescale missile attacks by ballistic and cruise missiles
with enhanced precision strike capabilities; hybrid
warfare, including information warfare such as false



**Reinforcing the Defense Architecture of the Whole Country**

The SDF must be strong in order to protect Japan, but
national defense cannot be achieved without a wholeof country approach For this reason besides the


fundamental reinforcement of its defense capabilities,
Japan will develop a defense architecture for the whole
country by integrating its national power which includes

its diplomatic, intelligence, economic, and technological
capabilities, and systematically combining various policy
means. To strengthen such whole-of-government efforts,
it is essential to break down the stove-piping approach
within the Government. This requires Japan to reinforce
the comprehensive defense architecture that mobilizes its


national power by taking the initiatives shown in Fig. III1-1-2, an undertaking that is integral to supplementing
the fundamental reinforcement of defense capabilities.

Since the Cabinet decision in December 2021, these
information gathering activities have been utilizing two
P-3C patrol aircraft of the Deployment Air Force for
Counter Piracy Enforcement (DAPE), as well as one
destroyer of the Deployment Surface Force for Counter
Piracy Enforcement (DSPE).
The areas of operation consist of the high seas of three
areas of water: the Gulf of Oman, the northern Arabian
Sea, and the Gulf of Aden to the east of the Bab elMandeb Strait (including the exclusive economic zones
of the coastal states).
Information gathered by the SDF is shared with the
Cabinet Secretariat, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure,
Transport and Tourism (MLIT), Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA), and other relevant ministries and
agencies, as well as with relevant industries through
public-private liaison meetings, to be used for the

of Japan-related vessels as a part of the government’s
navigation safety measures.
The activities are to be conducted in accordance with
the provisions of Article 4, paragraph (1), item (xviii)
of the Act for Establishment of the Ministry of Defense,
as they would need smooth decision making and order

In the Middle East, although there is no immediate need
to protect Japan related vessels high tensions persist


and, based on the fact that each country is continuing
its own activities, including the “International Maritime
Security Construct” by the United States and other
countries, since 2020, the Japanese Government has
been extending the SDF’s activity period by about one
year every year.
In light of the need to ensure the safety of navigation
for Japan-related vessels, if it is deemed before the
expiration of the period that activities by the SDF are no
longer necessary, then, in addition to concluding these
activities at that point and without waiting for the end
of the activity period, the National Security Council will
consider how to respond if there is a significant change
in the situation.

**3 Communication and Cooperation with**
**Relevant Countries**

**(1) United States**
As a result of a comprehensive review of what measures
Japan should take to ensure the safe navigation of Japanrelated vessels in the Middle East, Japan has started
to implement efforts as Japan’s independent initiative
without participating in the International Maritime
Security Construct led by the United States, considering
the need for ensuring a stable supply of crude oil, relations
with the United States, and relations with Iran. At the
same time, to ensure safe navigation in the Middle East,
the SDF has been cooperating closely with the United
States in various ways. In the information gathering
activities, the SDF will also appropriately cooperate
with the United States as an ally, while observing the
government’s policy of conducting navigation safety
measures independently from any other country’s
initiatives. For this reason, an MSDF officer has been


Crew members of a naval vessel engaged in information gathering activities

dispatched to the U.S. Central Naval Command in
Bahrain as a liaison officer to share information with the
U.S. Forces.


**(2) Coastal States in the Middle East**
It is important to gain the understanding of the coastal
states, including Iran, regarding the information gathering
activities that Japan is undertaking as an independent
initiative, and Japan has been explaining these activities
to them with transparency. In addition, the coastal states
play an important role in ensuring safe navigation in the
Middle East. Japan has been reaching out to the coastal
states to gain their understanding of Japan’s efforts.

regarding the Senkaku Islands in the 1970s, after a UN agency
pointed out possible oil reserves in the East China Sea in 1968.
It had not raised any objections until this point.
However, since Chinese maritime patrol vessels intruded into

use of vessels, aircraft, and so on as required.
The information obtained through such monitoring
and surveillance activities is shared with the related
ministries and agencies, including the Japan Coast Guard
(JCG), in order to strengthen coordination. In addition,
the JCG began operation of the MQ-9B (SeaGuardian) at
the MSDF Hachinohe Air Base in October 2022, while
the MSDF began trial operations using the SeaGuardian
at the Hachinohe Air Base in May 2023 in order to
verify whether unmanned aerial vehicles can in the
future serve as replacements for some of its missions,
such as monitoring and surveillance currently conducted
by piloted aircraft. Going forward, the MSDF and the
JCG will share information that they have respectively
acquired and improve operational efficiency through
mutual use of their facilities.
In addition to this, in December 2022, the ASDF
established the Reconnaissance Group (Misawa City,
Aomori Prefecture) which operates RQ-4B (Global
Hawk) aircraft in order to reinforce such capabilities as
constant surveillance.

Coast Guard vessels have repeatedly intruded into
Japan’s territorial waters around the Senkaku Islands.
In addition, there have been cases that Chinese naval
vessels navigate in the Japan’s territorial and contiguous
waters around the Nansei Islands.
The MOD/SDF will continue to take all measures,
including monitoring and surveillance, with a strong
sense of urgency in order to staunchly protect Japan’s
territorial land, waters, and airspace.

**3 Whole-of-Government Responses**


In order to never tolerate unilateral changes to the status
quo by force, it is important for the related organizations
to cooperate to take action based on decision-making
by the Government as a whole during peacetime. For
this reason, the Government as a whole will conduct
simulations and integrated training and exercises
to improve the effectiveness of responses, while
establishing coordination procedures on a regular basis.

**(2) Responses by the MOD/SDF**
A. General Situation
The ASDF detects and identifies aircraft flying in
airspace surrounding Japan using warning and control
radars as well as early warning and control aircraft. If
any suspicious aircraft heading to Japan’s territorial
airspace are detected, fighters and other aircraft scramble
to approach them in order to confirm the situation and
monitor the aircraft as necessary. Furthermore, in the
event that this suspicious aircraft has actually intruded
into territorial airspace, a warning to leave the airspace
would be issued, among other responses.
In FY2022, ASDF aircraft scrambled 778 times
(575 times in response to Chinese aircraft, 150 times in
response to Russian aircraft, and 53 other times).
Flight patterns of Chinese military aircraft in recent
years have changed, and now their range of activities are
extending to not only the East China Sea, but also the
Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Japan In addition Chinese

of Japan, including the intrusion into Japan’s territorial
airspace by Russian aircraft in March 2022 as well as the
long-range joint flights by Chinese and Russian bombers
near Japan in May and November 2022.
The MOD/SDF will take all possible measures
against intrusions into Japan’s territorial airspace while
continuing to closely monitor the increasingly active
movements of the Chinese and Russian militaries in the
future.
B. Responses to Balloons and Other Such Objects of
Foreign Countries
After further analysis, the MOD made an announcement
in February 2023 that certain balloon-shaped flying
objects that had been confirmed in Japanese airspace
in the past, including those in November 2019, June
2020, and September 2021, were strongly presumed as
unmanned surveillance balloons flown by China.
It is a violation of Japanese airspace when objects of
foreign countries, even if they are balloons, intrude into
our airspace without permission. If a foreign balloon
intrudes into Japanese airspace without permission,
Japan will make a judgment as to whether or not it is
a balloon of a foreign government and its impact on
the lives and property of Japanese citizens, taking into

still continues its intrusion in Japanese airspace and other
such cases, SDF aircraft will respond with “necessary
measures” as stipulated in Article 84 of the Self-Defense
Forces Law, including the use of weapons.
The Japanese Government has traditionally considered
that the use of weapons during scrambles responding
to intrusions into Japanese airspace is permissible only
when such measures fall under the requirements of
legitimate self-defense or necessity. This consideration
assumes manned and military aircraft. Given that the

balloons that intrude into Japanese airspace, would not
directly harm people, the Japanese Government clarified
the interpretation of the Article concerning the use of
weapons against unmanned aircraft as follows: in such
a case where the safety of aircraft cannot be ensured if
the situation is left as it is, and when deemed necessary
to use weapons to protect legal interests, such as the lives
and property of people within the Japanese territory as
well as the safety of aircraft flying along air routes, such
use of weapons can be permitted even if it does not fall
under the requirements of legitimate self-defense or
necessity.
In order to protect the lives and property of Japanese
citizens and to safeguard Japan’s sovereignty, Japan takes
more rigorous measures in accordance with international
laws and customs amid increasing threats of intrusions
into Japanese airspace by various means, including
unmanned aerial vehicles such as balloons.

**Chapter**


MSDF vessels and Japan Coast Guard patrol vessels participating in training for dealing with suspicious vessels

In November 2004, the MSDF observed a submerged
Chinese nuclear-powered submarine navigating under
Japanese territorial waters around the Sakishima Islands.
In response to this incident, the MSDF issued an order
for maritime security operations, and continued to track
the submarine with MSDF vessels until it entered the
high seas. In addition, in January 2018, underwater
navigation by a Chinese submarine was confirmed for
the first time through Japan’s contiguous zone in the
vicinity of the Senkaku Islands.
Furthermore, on September 10, 2021, a submarine
presumed to be Chinese was confirmed to be navigating
underwater through the Japanese contiguous zone in
the vicinity of Amami Oshima Island, and monitoring
and surveillance operations were carried out by MSDF
destroyers and patrol aircraft. Although this submarine
did not intrude into territorial waters, such submarine
activity should be closely monitored by Japan. Under
international law, a foreign submarine must display its
flag while navigating in the territorial waters of a coastal
state. The SDF will maintain a vigilant monitoring and
surveillance posture to ensure that activities in violation
of international law are not permitted.

**3 Response to Armed Special Operations**
**Vessels**


**(1) Basic Concept**
With respect to foreign submarines navigating underwater
in Japan’s territorial waters,[6] an order for maritime
security operations will be issued. The submarine will
be requested to navigate on the surface of the water and
show its flag, in accordance with international law, and
in the event that the submarine does not comply with
the request, the SDF will request it to leave Japanese
territorial waters.

**(2) Response by the MOD/SDF**
The MSDF is maintaining and enhancing capabilities
for: expressing its intention not to permit any navigation
that violates international law; and responding in shallow
water areas by detecting, identifying, and tracking
foreign submarines navigating under the territorial
waters of Japan.


**(1) Basic Concept**
The Japan Coast Guard, as a police organization, is
primarily responsible for responding to suspicious
armed special operations vessels (unidentified vessels).
However, in the event that it is deemed extremely difficult
or impossible for the Japan Coast Guard to respond to a


-----

situation, an order for maritime security operations will
be issued and the situation will be handled by the SDF in
cooperation with the Japan Coast Guard.

**(2) Responses by the MOD/SDF**
In light of the lessons learned from the cases of an
unidentified vessel off the Noto Peninsula in 1999, an
unidentified vessel in the sea southwest of Kyushu in
2001, and other similar incidents, the MOD/SDF have


been making various efforts. In particular, the MSDF has
been taking steps such as establishment of the MSDF
Special Boarding Unit[7] and equipment of destroyers
with machine guns. In addition, based on “the manual
for jointly dealing with suspicious vessels” formulated
by the then Defense Agency and the Japan Coast Guard
in 1999, the MSDF has regularly conducted joint training
with the JCG in order to strengthen coordination.

For responding to an invasion of Japan, including its
remote islands, Japan needs to ensure that its routinely
deployed units remain operational at all times and that
the necessary units (personnel, equipment, supplies, etc.)
are swiftly maneuvered and deployed according to the
situation, in order to secure maritime and air superiority
and disrupt the access and landing of units invading
Japan.
To this end, Japan will reinforce the SDF’s maritime
and air transportation capabilities, and also maximize
its use of civilian transportation capabilities, including
Private Finance Initiatives (PFI).
In addition, in order to ensure smoother and more
effective transport and supplies for units by the
aforementioned capabilities, Japan will strengthen our
integrated logistics posture, take necessary measures to
use existing airports, seaport facilities, etc. as operational
infrastructure, and improve supply capabilities. Japan
will also actively promote the improvement of supply
bases located throughout the country. In conjunction with
these, Japan will strengthen its transportation capabilities
by acquiring various transport assets such as transport
vessels, transport aircraft, and transport helicopters.
Apart from this, the SDF has conducted a number
of training exercises, including bilateral/multilateral


training with the United States and other relevant
countries, in order to improve its mobile deployment
capabilities.

**(4) Strengthening of the Defense Architecture in the**
**Southwestern Region**

In order to strengthen the defense architecture in the
southwestern region, new establishment of units is being
conducted in the Kyushu/southwestern region. In March
2023, the GSDF established a new camp on Ishigakijima
Island, where an area security unit, surface-to-air guided
missile unit, and surface-to-ship guided missile unit
are stationed, and the Amphibious Rapid Deployment
Brigade’s 3rd Amphibious Rapid Deployment
Regiment (tentative name) will be newly formed at
Camp Takematsu (Omura City, Nagasaki Prefecture)
in FY2023. In addition, the 15th Brigade (Naha City,
Okinawa Prefecture) is planned to be reorganized into a
division in the future.
With regard to the operation of V-22 Ospreys, the
MOD has determined that Saga Airport is the best airfield
for deployment, and the governor of Saga Prefecture
expressed acceptance of this arrangement. In May
2023, the MOD signed a real estate purchase contract
with the Saga Prefecture fishery cooperative federation
and acquired the planned camp location.[4] On the other
hand, the MOD newly created an airlift wing equipped
with V-22 Ospreys at Camp Kisarazu in 2020 with
consideration of the time needed to deploy the aircraft
to Saga Airport, and began provisional deployment of
the aircraft.

**(2) Responses by the MOD/SDF**
North Korea has forcefully conducted three nuclear
tests since 2016. Especially since the beginning of 2022,
North Korea has repeatedly launched ballistic missiles
and other missiles with unprecedented high frequency
and in new ways. These military actions pose a threat to
Japan’s security that is more grave and imminent than
ever before.
For responding to ballistic missiles, currently the SDF
maneuvers and deploys, according to situation, Aegisequipped destroyers for defense of the entire territory
of Japan and Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3),[5]
which is deployed across the country for the defense of
stationing locations. On April 22, 2023, the Minister of
Defense issued a “General order for the Self-Defense
Forces concerning preparation for destruction measures
against ballistic missiles, etc.” in light of matters such
as North Korea’s announcement that it would shortly
finish final preparations for the launch of a completed
“military reconnaissance satellite.” In response, the
MOD/SDF implemented the necessary preparations


for the deployment of PAC-3s to Ishigakijima Island,
Miyakojima Island, and Yonagunijima Island in Okinawa
Prefecture, as well as the deployment of Aegis-equipped
destroyers.
On May 29 of the same year, in response to an advance
notification from North Korea that the “satellite” was
to be launched, the Minister of Defense issued an
“Operation Order for the Self-Defense Forces concerning
implementation for destructive measures against
ballistic missiles, etc.” on the same day to take necessary
preparations for contingencies. Upon the launch on
May 31, the MOD promptly shared information within
the government and with related organizations, and
collected and analyzed related information. The MOD,
in close cooperation with the United States, the Republic
of Korea (ROK), and other countries, will continue to
make all efforts to collect and analyze information and
conduct surveillance in order to protect the lives and
property of Japanese citizens.
Cases involving ballistic missiles launched against
Japan as an armed attack will be dealt with by issuing a

the other hand, if such a situation is not yet acknowledged
as an armed attack, Japan will take destructive measures
against ballistic missiles, etc.[6]

Currently, Japan’s ballistic missile defense (BMD) is
basically an effective multi-layered defense system with
the upper tier interception by Aegis-equipped destroyers
and the lower tier by PAC-3, both interconnected and
coordinated by the Japan Aerospace Defense Ground
Environment (JADGE).[7]

As a response against ballistic missiles, the Joint Task
Force-BMD will be formed with the Commander of the
Air Defense Command serving as its Commander, and
effective defenses will be taken under a unified command
through JADGE.
The MOD/SDF continues to carefully monitor


the concrete actions of North Korea toward the
dismantlement of weapons of mass destruction and
missiles, and conducts the necessary collection and
analyses of information, monitoring and surveillance
activities, and other necessary activities while closely
cooperating with the United States and other countries.
Further cooperation with the U.S. Government
including the U.S. Forces in Japan is essential for
efficient and effective operation of the BMD system.
Thus, related measures including constant real-time
sharing of BMD operational and relevant information,
and the expansion of BMD cooperation have been agreed
upon at the Japan-U.S. Security Consultative Committee
(2+2 Meeting).
Furthermore, Japan has closely cooperated with the
United States in responding to ballistic missiles, by

**(3) Initiatives to Reinforce Integrated Air and Missile**
**Defense Capabilities**

Japan began developing the BMD system in 2004 to
be fully prepared for the response against ballistic missile
attacks and other attacks, and necessary amendments
were subsequently made to the Self-Defense Forces Law
in July 2005. To date, Japan has steadily built up its own
defense system against ballistic missile attacks, by such
means as installing ballistic missile defense capability
to the Aegis-equipped destroyers and deploying PAC-3.
In order to deal with future threats posed by
increasingly advanced and diverse ballistic missile
attacks, Japan and the United States have jointly
developed advanced interceptor missiles for BMD (SM3 Block IIA), the successor to Standard Missile-3 (SM-3)
Block IA to be mounted on Aegis-equipped destroyers,
and acquired them since FY2017. In comparison with
SM-3 Block IA, SM-3 Block IIA have not only extended
interceptable altitude and coverage of protection, but also
have enhanced defeating capability and simultaneous
engagement capability.
In addition, the interception capabilities of SM-3
Block IIA have been enhanced against ballistic missiles
equipped with interception avoidance measures such as
a decoy and ballistic missiles launched with an intention
to avoid being intercepted by taking a higher than normal
trajectory (lofted trajectory).[9] In November 2022, the
MSDF conducted its first SM-3 Block IIA launch test,
and the Aegis destroyer Maya successfully intercepted
the target.
Furthermore, the Cabinet approved the development
of two Aegis system-equipped vessels instead of the landbased Aegis system (Aegis Ashore) in December 2020, as
part of measures to be taken to respond more flexibly and
effectively to the increasingly severe security environment
surrounding Japan. These vessels are maintained by the


MSDF and have high defense capabilities with SM-6
which have the capability to respond to anti-ship ballistic
missiles and the like, and long-range guided missiles
such as the Upgraded Type-12 SSM, as well as various
warfare and mobility capabilities equivalent to those of
existing Aegis-equipped destroyers. In addition, there
will be consideration for the expandability of the vessels
to enable them to operate future equipment, such as new
interceptor missiles respond to HGVs currently being
developed by the United States, and their seakeeping
ability and habitability will also be improved.
With regard to PAC-3, the MOD has been working
for procurement of the enhanced capability type, PAC3 MSE (Missile Segment Enhancement), and started its
deployment at the end of FY2019. Introduction of PAC3 MSE will realize the extension of interception altitude
from less than 20 km to tens of km, meaning that the
coverage of protection (area) will expand more than
twice compared to the conventional PAC-3.
On the other hand, in order to use optimum means
to effectively and efficiently counter airborne threats,
which are growing increasingly diverse, complex,
and enhanced including the emergence of HGV, and
minimize damage, it is necessary to establish a structure
to conduct integrated operation of various equipment for
missile defense and air defense equipment that each SDF
service has separately used, thereby providing nationwide protection and also enhancing integrated air and
missile defense capabilities that can simultaneously deal

with multiple, complex airborne threats. In this regard,
the SDF will strive to standardize and streamline the
means for interception that each SDF service possesses,
including their maintenance and supply systems.
Therefore, in order to enhance the detection and
tracking capabilities of HGVs and the like, the groundbased air surveillance, warning and control radar (FPS)
and the like will be procured and given enhanced
capabilities, and will be replaced and upgraded with the
next-generation warning and control radar. In addition,
the Patriot surface-to-air guided missile system will
be upgraded and a new radar (Lower Tier Air Missile
Defense Sensor (LTAMDS))[10] will be introduced to
improve the PAC-3MSE’s capability to respond to
HGVs and the like. Moreover, Japan will develop the
upgraded Type 03 medium-range surface-to-air missile


(modified), and conduct research on a guided missile
system for countering HGVs in order to deal with the
threat of HGVs flying at hypersonic speeds and with
high mobility in the high altitude range.
In this way, Japan is taking measures necessary to
strengthen its protection structure and will continue
these efforts.

**(2) Japan-U.S. BMD Technical Cooperation, etc.**
The Government commenced a Japan-U.S. cooperative technical
research project on a sea-based upper-tier system in FY1999.
In FY2006, Japan-U.S. cooperative development[12] of advanced
interceptor missiles for BMD began, leading to the deployment of
SM-3 Block IIA. In addition, at the Japan-U.S. “2+2” Meeting in
January 2022, the two countries agreed to conduct a joint analysis
focusing on future cooperation to counter hypersonic technology.
Moreover, at the Japan-U.S. “2+2” meeting in January 2023, based on
the progress of this joint analysis, the two countries agreed to initiate
joint research on advanced materials and key elements, including
testing in hypersonic environments, and to begin discussions on the
possibility of joint development of future interceptors.


**2 Missile Defense of the United States and**
**Japan-U.S. BMD Technical Cooperation**

**(1) Missile Defense of the United States**
The United States is developing a multi-tier missile
defense system that combines defense systems suited
for each of the following phases of the ballistic missile
flight path to provide a mutually complementary
response: (1) the boost phase, (2) the mid-course phase,
and (3) the terminal phase. Japan and the United States
have developed close coordination concerning ballistic
missile defense, and a part of the missile defense system
of the United States has been deployed in our country.[11]


11 Specifically, a TPY-2 radar (so-called X-band radar) for BMD was deployed at the U.S. Shariki Communication Site in 2006. In October 2006, Patriot PAC-3 units were deployed in Okinawa
Prefecture, and in October 2007, a Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS) was deployed in Aomori Prefecture. Furthermore, the 2nd TPY-2 radar was deployed at the U.S. Kyogamisaki Communication
Site in December 2014. In October 2018, the 38th Air Defense Artillery Brigade Headquarters was deployed in Sagamihara. In addition, BMD-capable Aegis ships of the U.S. Forces were deployed
at Commander Fleet Activities, Yokosuka (Yokosuka City, Kanagawa Prefecture) in October 2015, March 2016 and May 2018.

12 With regard to the Japan-U.S. cooperative development, it is necessary to export BMD-related arms from Japan to the United States. In accordance with the Chief Cabinet Secretary’s statement
issued in December 2004, it was determined that the Three Principles on Arms Exports would not apply to the BMD system and related matters under the condition that strict controls are maintained.
Based on these circumstances, it was decided that the prior consent of Japan could be given to the third party transfer of the SM-3 Block IIA under certain conditions. This decision was formally
announced in the Joint Statement of the Japan-U.S. “2+2” in June 2011. The Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology (Three Principles) received Cabinet approval in
April 2014. However, with regard to exceptional measures instigated before this decision, overseas transfers will continue to be organized in the guidelines for the principles as allowable under the

**Responses in the Ground, Maritime, and Air Domains**
**3**


The aspects of ways of warfare have changed drastically
from those of the past. In addition to large-scale missile
attacks and hybrid warfare including information
warfare, it is necessary to respond to the traditional forms
of warfare such as invasion through air, sea, and land.
Japan’s ground, maritime, and air defense capabilities
form the basis of its cross-domain operations. For
invasions of Japan, including our remote islands, we will
secure and maintain our maritime and air superiority to
block access and landing of invading forces.
In the event of a military attack on Japan, the SDF will
respond with defensive mobilization. Their operations
are categorized into (1) air defense operations, (2)
defense operations protecting waters surrounding Japan,
(3) operations protecting the land, and (4) operations
ensuring security in maritime transportation, In
executing these operations, the U.S. Forces will assist


the operations implemented by the SDF and conduct
operations to complement the capabilities of the SDF,
including the use of striking power, in line with the
Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation.

**3 Operations Protecting the Land**


In order to occupy Japan, invading countries are expected
to gain sea and air superiority, followed by the landing
of ground troops from the sea and airborne troops from
the air.
For invading ground and airborne troops, it tends to
be difficult to exert systematic combat capabilities while
they are moving on their vessels or aircraft or right
before or after they land in our territory. As we protect
our land, we need to make best use of this weakness to
deal with our enemies between coastal and sea areas or
at landing points as much as possible and attack them at
an early stage.

See Fig. III-1-4-8 (Example of Operations Protecting the Land)


If an armed attack is carried out against Japan, which
is an island country, aerial attacks are expected to be
combined with attacks against our ships and territory by
enemy destroyers. In addition, transport vessels could
be deployed to enable massive enemy ground forces to
invade our territory. Our defense operations protecting
the waters surrounding Japan are composed of measures
at sea, measures in waters around our coasts, measures
in major straits, and aerial defense above waters around

**Chapter**


The Cabinet Office’s National Space Policy Secretariat
engages in the planning, drafting, coordinating, and other
policy matters relating to the Government’s development
and utilization of space. Formulated based on the Basic
Space Act, the Basic Plan on Space Policy is the most
fundamental plan for space development and utilization
in Japan, and aims to strengthen the comprehensive
infrastructure that supports Japan’s space activities.
The current plan was formulated in June 2020 and is
scheduled to be revised in June 2023.
Moreover, the NDS will compile the challenges in the
field of space security as well as the Government’s ideas
for materializing its policies, and this will be reflected in


In the space domain, the MOD/SDF will further reinforce
its operational capabilities in the ground, maritime,
and air domains by actively incorporating novel forms
of space utilization, including satellite constellations,
and providing functions such as information gathering,
communications, and positioning from space. At the
same time, in order to counter threats to the stable
utilization of space, surveillance capabilities from space

will be developed and a Space Domain Awareness
(SDA)[16] system will be established and the resiliency
of the MOD/SDF’s space assets will be bolstered to
allow missions to be continued in response to various
situations. In addition, the MOD/SDF will further
reinforce capabilities to disrupt opponents’ command
and control, information and communications, etc.
Furthermore, the MOD/SDF will strengthen
cooperation and collaboration, including research
and development, with related organizations and
private businesses, including the Japan Aerospace
Exploration Agency (JAXA). The MOD/SDF will also
strengthen cooperation in areas such as human resource
development through exchanges with our ally and likeminded countries such as the United States.

See Fig. III-1-4-9 (Conceptual Image of Utilization of Space in the

**(1) Improvement of Capabilities by Leveraging**
**Space Domain Including Information Gathering,**
**Communications and Positioning**

The MOD/SDF have been utilizing satellites for
information gathering, communications, and positioning
and so on, and will also respond to the recent expansion
of space utilization through satellite constellations.
In September 2021, the MOD established the Task
Force on Satellite Constellations, chaired by the State
Minister of Defense and having discussions on future
space policies and consideration towards utilization
of satellite constellations by the MOD/SDF, bearing
cooperation with the United States.
A. Information Gathering
With regard to information gathering, the MOD/SDF
will build a seamless information gathering system
through acquisition of multilayered satellite images,
such as by using Information Gathering Satellites
(IGS),[17] and civilian satellites such as small satellite
constellations that enable frequent imaging. In particular,
from the perspective of ensuring the effectiveness of
Japan’s stand-off defense capabilities, it is necessary
to fundamentally strengthen our information gathering
capabilities. In addition to strengthening cooperation


with the United States, the MOD/SDF will build a
satellite constellation to acquire the capability to detect
and track targets, which will be supplemented by various
initiatives, including the use of civilian satellites.
B. Communications
Regarding communications, the MOD/SDF launched
X-band defense communications satellites called
Kirameki-2 in January 2017 and Kirameki-1 in April
2018, owned and operated by the MOD for the first time,
to be used for the information and communication, which
is essential for command and control in unit operations.
Going forward, in order to respond to the increase in
communications requirements and to further strengthen
resiliency, the MOD/SDF is aiming for a system of three
X-band defense communications satellites by launching
Kirameki-3 in FY2023. The MOD/SDF will also procure
more receiver equipment and enhance broadband ground
station communications in order to expand equipment
and related ground facilities capable of communicating
with Kirameki.
In addition to conducting demonstrations of the use
of Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) Communications Satellite
Constellation Services, the MOD/SDF will also develop
and demonstrate communications equipment towards
joining Protected Anti-jam Tactical SATCOM (PATS),
a framework for sharing satellite communications
bandwidth among member countries, centered on the
United States.
C. Positioning
With regard to positioning, the MOD/SDF mount global
position system (GPS) receiving terminals on a large
amount of equipment and use them as important means
to support advanced unit operations, including highly
accurate self-positioning and improvement of missile
guidance accuracy. In addition to these efforts, the
Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS)[18] of the Cabinet
Office started service in November 2018. With this in
mind, the MOD/SDF will secure redundancy by using
positioning signals, including those of QZSS.
D. Other Uses of Outer Space
Small satellite constellations are attracting attention
as a technological trend related to missile detection,

early warning, and tracking functions. The MOD
believes that infrared observation from space using
satellite constellations may be effective as a means of
early detection and tracking of HGVs being developed
and deployed by various countries, and will conduct a
demonstration in space of an infrared sensor equipped
to satellites.
In addition, the MOD will promote research on future
sensors, such as high-sensitivity wideband infrared
detection elements.

**(2) Efforts to Ensure Stable Utilization of Space**
While utilization of satellites plays a vital role as the
basic infrastructure for security, some countries appear
to be developing anti-satellite weapons, including killer
satellites, anti-satellite missiles, and jamming weapons
that interfere with electromagnetic waves. Therefore,
it is necessary to strengthen the resiliency of SDA and
space utilization.
The MOD/SDF have been working to strengthen their
capabilities to secure superiority in space utilization.
As part of these efforts, they have been working to
enhance Space Situational Awareness (SSA). Going
forward, the MOD/SDF will continue to strengthen
SSA, which enables learning the position, orbit, and


to enhance SDA, which enables grasping the operational
status, aims, and capabilities of satellites. In order to
enhance the MOD/SDF’s SDA-related capabilities on
a regular basis, in addition to the development of the
SDA satellite scheduled for launch in FY2026, various
initiatives will be promoted, including consideration of
further operations with multiple satellites. Moreover, the
MOD/SDF will develop a space operations command
and control system, etc. to strengthen the operational
infrastructure for space operations.
With regard to the strengthening of resiliency of
space utilization, the MOD/SDF will ensure resiliency
against jamming and other interference through the
demonstration of technology with enhanced resiliency
for satellite communications, and will also ensure
cybersecurity for SSA systems, etc. towards future JapanU.S. space system cooperation. In addition, the MOD/
SDF will build capabilities to disrupt C4I of opponents
in coordination with the electromagnetic domain.

information on space objects approaching Japan s
satellites, the 2nd Space Operations Squadron (Hofu
Kita) which is responsible for operating equipment to
monitor interference with Japan’s satellites and the like,
and the Space Systems Management Squadron (Fuchu)
were newly organized in FY2022 under the Space
Operations Group. In FY2023, the system for stable
operation of equipment for SDA will be strengthened
through expansion of personnel, and the command and
control functions and the like will be enhanced.
In addition, the MOD/SDF’s space operation capabilities
will be strengthened through the establishment of new
Space Domain Specialized Units under the command
of a general. For this, given the growing importance of
the space domain and the qualitative and quantitative
improvements that will be made to its space operation
capabilities, the ASDF shall be renamed the Air and Space
Self-Defense Force in view of the future positioning of
space operations alongside air operations as its core tasks.
In order to strengthen the organizational systems
and human resources base in the space field, the MOD/
SDF will continue to strengthen cooperation, including
human resources development, through exchanges with
related organizations such as JAXA as well as our ally
and like-minded countries such as the United States. The
MOD/SDF will also work to secure human resources
in the space domain, including the establishment of a
system to effectively utilize knowledge of the space field
accumulated among relevant ministries and agencies.

**(4) Strengthening of Cooperation with Related**
**Organizations and Space-Related Industries**

With regard to outer space, it is of vital importance
for both the lives of Japanese citizens and defense to
ensure stable utilization of space for purposes such as
information gathering, communications, and positioning.
The MOD/SDF are strengthening cooperation and
collaboration, including research and development, with
related organizations including JAXA and the private
businesses with regard to outer space. In doing so, the
MOD/SDF will promote investment in technological
development in the private sector by further utilizing
civilian technology in the defense field, and enhance
Japan’s overall capabilities in space.
In addition, in March 2023, with the start of the
operation of the SSA system, the MOD began providing
information on SSA, including orbit information on
space objects to the private businesses and others that


operate satellites.

**(5) Strengthening Cooperation with Our Ally, Like-**
**Minded Countries, and Others**

In order to ensure the sustainable and stable utilization of
outer space, which is essential to the security of Japan, it
is essential to strengthen cooperation with our ally, likeminded countries, and others. Japan is also conducting
cooperation towards reducing space threats through
norms, rules, and principles of responsible behaviors in
space. In September 2022, Japan decided not to conduct
satellite destruction testing with destructive, directascent missiles, with the intention of actively promoting
discussions in the international arena towards the
formation of norms for responsible behaviors in outer
space. This decision was announced in response to an
announcement to the same effect by the United States
in April of the same year. In addition to Japan, similar
announcements were made by Canada, New Zealand,
Germany, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Korea,
Australia, France, and others. Furthermore, in December
of the same year, under the leadership of the United
States, 11 countries, including Japan, made a joint
proposal for the “Direct-Ascent Anti-SATellite (DAASAT) missile testing” resolution, which was adopted at
a plenary session of the UN General Assembly with the
support of 155 countries.
At the same time, in order to avoid risks from
misunderstanding and miscalculation, it is necessary
to communicate the importance of strengthening
communication among relevant countries and of
implementing Transparency and Confidence Building
Measures (TCBM) in outer space.
A. Cooperation with the United States
From the perspective of further promoting cooperation
in the space domain between the defense authorities of
Japan and the United States, the two countries established
the Japan-U.S. Space Cooperation Working Group
(SCWG) at the Deputy Director General level in April
2015. The SCWG holds wide-ranging talks on space
cooperation, including collaboration on space policy
and strategy, cooperation between U.S. and Japanese
space operations forces including SDA informationsharing and education, and discussions on LEO satellite
constellations. Meetings of the SCWG have been held
eight times through now, most recently in May 2022.
In addition, the Japanese and U.S. governments hold
the Japan U S Comprehensive Space Dialogue (CSD)


**Part**
**Ⅲ**

**Chapter**


-----

and the Japanese and U.S. security authorities hold
the Japan-U.S. Space Security Dialogue (SSD). The
MOD participates in these meetings, in which there are
exchanges of information regarding the space policies of
both countries as well as discussions on future cooperation.
With regard to recent high-level exchanges, in October
2022, Chief of Space Operations John Raymond of the
U.S. Space Force paid a courtesy call on Minister of
Defense Hamada to exchange views on the importance
of ensuring the stable utilization of outer space and
cooperation, including for SDA. The two sides agreed
to accelerate cooperation towards further strengthening
the Japan-U.S. Alliance in the space domain. In addition,
during the Japan-U.S. “2+2” in January 2023, both sides
confirmed that they consider attacks to, from, or within
space present a clear challenge to the security of the
Alliance, and that such attacks, in certain circumstances,
could lead to the invocation of Article V of the JapanU.S. Security Treaty.
In terms of operations, because cooperation with the
United States is indispensable for effective operation of
the SSA system by the ASDF, The MOD/SDF is working
to materialize information-sharing with the United States.
Furthermore, The MOD/SDF continues to participate in
the Schriever Wargame, a multilateral tabletop exercise
on space security organized by the U.S. military, and the
Global Sentinel, a multilateral SSA tabletop exercise,
to share recognition of threats in space with multiple
countries, cooperate on SDA, and work to accumulate
knowledge on ensuring the functions of space systems.
In addition, SDF personnel are dispatched to the U.S.
Space Command’s Multinational Space Collaboration
(MSC) Office.
B. Cooperation with Like-Minded Countries, Etc.
Japan has been cooperating and collaborating with likeminded countries in various fields, including strengthening
relations among defense authorities, cooperation related
to SDA information, and cooperation among space
operations forces, through consultations, information


sharing, and participation in multilateral exercises.
With regard to Australia, consultations (at the director
level) on space cooperation among the Japanese and
Australian defense authorities have been held since May
2021. In addition, in November 2022, Japan and Australia
signed the Letter of Intent Concerning a Defence Space
Partnership, which will deepen space cooperation.
Furthermore, Japan and Australia established a Space
Working Group (SWG) to discuss specific cooperation
among space operations forces.
With regard to France, Japan and France have been
conducting consultations (at the director level) on space
cooperation between the Japanese and French defense
authorities since December 2021. The two countries
are also coordinating on the promotion of unit-to-unit
exchanges including participation by the SDF in the
multilateral space exercise (ASTERX) organized by the
French Air and Space Forces, strengthening cooperation
between Japan’s Space Operations Group and the
French Space Command, strengthening information
sharing arrangements related to SDA, and other
efforts. In addition, the MOD participates in the JapanFrance Comprehensive Space Dialogue between the
governments of Japan and France.
With regard to the United Kingdom, the Japanese
and U.K. defense authorities have been holding space
consultations since August 2022, and have been
coordinating on collaboration on space policy and
strategy, promotion of cooperation and exchanges among
space operations forces, information sharing related to
SDA, and other matters.
With regard to Germany, Japan and Germany have
been holding expert meetings on space cooperation
between forces, and will develop coordination by
holding a meeting of their SWG to deepen cooperation
between space operations forces.

**Chapter**


In the cyber domain, it is important to gather and share
information at all stages from peacetime to emergencies
through cooperation with other countries, relevant
ministries and agencies, and the private businesses, as
well as to strengthen Japan’s overall response capabilities
in the cybersecurity field.
In light of the fact that policies in the cybersecurity
field will be centrally and comprehensively coordinated
throughout the Government, the MOD/SDF will
promote initiatives that contribute to strengthening
cooperation with related ministries and agencies, critical
infrastructure companies, and the defense industry, while
enhancing their own level of cybersecurity.

See Part 1, Chapter 4, Section 3 (Trends in the Cyber Domain)

See


**1 The Whole-of-Government Approach**
**and Other Initiatives**


**2 Initiatives of the MOD/SDF**

The cyber domain is not only core infrastructure in
the daily lives of the people of Japan, but also of vital
importance for carrying out cross-domain operations for
the defense of Japan.
The MOD/SDF will coordinate with whole-ofgovernment initiatives in the field of cybersecurity,
including active cyber defense. In doing so, the MOD/
SDF will shift to a posture where persistent risk
management is implemented, primarily on critical
systems, etc., and significantly increase the number
of cyberspace personnel capable of performing such
tasks. the MOD/SDF will also achieve a high level of
cybersecurity, especially by utilizing highly-skilled
external human resources. the MOD/SDF will protect
itself from all cyber threats with our high cybersecurity
capabilities, and will use these capabilities to strengthen
the cybersecurity of our country as a whole.
To this end, the MOD/SDF will establish a posture
that can protect its command and control capabilities as
well as its high-priority equipment systems even under
cyber attacks[20] along with a posture for supporting cyber
defense for the defense industry by FY2027.
By approximately ten years from now, the MOD/SDF
will have established a posture to safeguard its command
and control capabilities, force projection capabilities,
and operational bases to allow missions to be executed
even under cyber attacks, and strengthened its posture for
supporting the cybersecurity of entities other than the SDF.


In order to deal with increasing cybersecurity threats,
in November 2014, the Basic Act on Cybersecurity was
enacted. The Act aims to contribute to the security of
Japan by comprehensively and effectively promoting
measures regarding cybersecurity.
Based on the Act, in January 2015, the Cybersecurity
Strategic Headquarters was established in the Cabinet,
and the National center of Incident readiness and
Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISC)[19] was established
in the Cabinet Secretariat. The Cybersecurity Strategic
Headquarters and NISC are responsible for planning,
drafting, and promotion of cybersecurity-related policies
and serve as the control tower in taking measures and
responding to significant cybersecurity incidents in
government organizations and agencies, as well as
critical infrastructures.
In addition, the current Cybersecurity Strategy, which

B. Introduction of a Risk Management Framework (RMF)
As threats in the cyber domain are becoming more
advanced and sophisticated every day, the MOD/
SDF will shift its approach to information system
security measures from temporary “risk elimination”
to continuous “risk management,” and implement an
RMF from FY2023 onward. The RMF will continuously
analyze and evaluate risks and implement necessary
security measures even after information system
operation and management.
C. Protection of Information Systems
In order to appropriately respond to the latest cyber
attack threats, which are becoming more sophisticated
and complex every day, it is necessary to strengthen the
posture for protection of information systems. To this

with Cyber Attacks); Reference 19 (Efforts in Recent Years by
the MOD on Cybersecurity))


See


**(1) Establishing an Environment for Ensuring**
**Cybersecurity**

A. Strengthening of the Cyber-Specialized Units
Organization
The JSDF Cyber Defense Command was newly formed
in March 2022 as a joint unit and deals with cyber attacks.
It also provides support for training of cyber-specialized
units of the GSDF, MSDF, and ASDF, and maintains and
operates the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII),[21]
a common network for the MOD/SDF. From FY2023
onward, the MOD/SDF will continue to expand the
systems of the JSDF Cyber Defense Command and other
cyber-specialized units of the GSDF, MSDF, and ASDF,
and promote hiring and training of cyber personnel.
In addition, the MOD will strengthen its planning and
drafting function for cyber policies by reorganizing the
Information and Telecommunications Division of the


21 Common network for the entire SDF, the information and communications infrastructure necessary to perform the SDF’s duties, which is composed of data communications networks and voice

end, the SDF will develop a cloud system that integrates
and standardizes SDF systems, implement centralized
cybersecurity measures, strengthen the protective
posture of equipment systems and facility infrastructure
systems, and enhance the threat hunting function that
continuously searches for and detects potential internal
threats based on the assumption that threats have already
penetrated inside the network.

**(2) Cooperation with Private Companies and Other**
**Countries**

In order to respond to cyber attacks in a swift and
appropriate manner, it is necessary to keep abreast of the
latest information, including cyber-related risks, counter
measures and technological trends, through cooperation
with the private sector, and strategic talks, joint exercises
and other opportunities with allies and other parties. For
this purpose, the MOD/SDF will effectively cooperate
with private companies and foreign countries, including
the United States, which is Japan’s ally.
a. Cooperation with Private Companies and Others
In July 2013, the Cyber Defense Council (CDC)
was set up with its members consisting of around ten
companies in the defense industry with a strong interest
in cybersecurity. With the MOD serving as the hub for
information sharing among companies in the defense
industry, information is aggregated, and efforts are made
to grasp the overall picture of cyber attacks. In addition, a
joint training takes place annually, simulating a situation
where the MOD/SDF, and defense industry are under
cyber attacks as part of efforts to improve both of their
cyber response capabilities.
b. Cooperation with the United States
In order to strengthen the foundation that supports
effective Japan-U.S. joint responses at all levels,
Japan will further strengthen information sharing at
all levels and fundamentally strengthen efforts related
to information security and cybersecurity to enable
both Japan and the United States to fully exercise their
capabilities.
In October 2013, the Japanese and U.S. governments
set up the Cyber Defense Policy Working Group
(CDPWG) as a framework for policy consultations
between the defense authorities of the two countries.
Under this framework, meetings have been held eight
times to conduct specialized, specific consideration
on a wide range of fields, including (1) promotion of
policy consultations regarding cyber issues (2) closer


sharing of information, (3) promotion of joint training
incorporating response to cyber attacks, and (4)
cooperation for training and retaining experts.
The Guidelines and the CDPWG Joint Statement
published in 2015 cited the prompt and appropriate
establishment of an information sharing structure and
the protection of the critical infrastructure upon which
the SDF and the U.S. Forces depend to accomplish
their missions as examples of cooperation between the
Japanese and U.S. governments. In addition, as part of
cooperation between the SDF and the U.S. Forces, the
securing of the resiliency of their respective networks
and systems and the implementation of educational
exchanges and joint exercises were also cited.
In addition, at their “2+2” in April 2019, Japan and the
United States confirmed that international law applies
in cyberspace and that a cyber attack could, in certain
circumstances, constitute an armed attack under Article
V of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty.
Furthermore, Japan’s cooperation with the United
States is to be further strengthened by such means as
participation in the Japan-U.S. Cyber Dialogue, a wholeof-government framework by both nations, and holding
the Japan-U.S. IT Forum.
In terms of operational cooperation, cyber attack
countermeasure training has been conducted as part of
the Japan-U.S. Bilateral Joint Exercise (field training
exercises) and the Japan-U.S. Joint Regional Army
command post exercise. Efforts are continuing to
improve Japan-U.S. joint response capabilities.
C. Cooperation with Like-Minded Countries, Etc.
Regarding the use of the cyber domain, Japan will
enhance its partnership and cooperation with relevant
countries through measures such as sharing views on
threat awareness, exchanging views on response to cyber
attacks, and participating in multilateral exercises.
Japan has organized the “Japan-NATO Expert Staff
Talks on Cyber Defense,” etc., with the respective
defense authorities of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and others to exchange opinions
on various issues related to cyberspace, and participates
in the CyCon International Conference on Cyber Conflict
organized by NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre
of Excellence (CCDCOE) established in Estonia. The
MOD has been dispatching personnel to the CCDCOE
since March 2019. In October 2022, Japan completed the
process of signing an arrangement for participation in
CCDCOE activities and the MOD officially participated

in the CCDCOE s activities.
In addition, Japan has held cyber dialogues with
Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany, France,
and Estonia. Moreover, Japan holds the IT Forum
with the defense authorities of Singapore, Vietnam,
and other countries to exchange views on initiatives
in the information communications area including
cybersecurity and current trends in technology, and
provides capacity-building support in the field of
cybersecurity.
With the aim of strengthening the SDF’s cyber domain
capabilities and cooperation with other countries, the SDF
participated in a joint Japan-U.K. team in the multilateral
cyber defense exercise “Locked Shields 2022” hosted by
CCDCOE in April 2022. The SDF also participated for
the first time in the Cyber Skills Challenge, a multilateral
cyber training exercise held by Australia from November
to December 2022, as well as the Defense Cyber Marvel
2 exercise held by the United Kingdom in February
2023. Furthermore, in February 2023, the GSDF held
Cyber KONGO 2023, a multilateral cyber protection
competition, with a total of 11 participating countries,
including the United States, Australia, the Netherlands,
Germany, France, Romania, Indonesia, Vietnam, and
others, to strengthen capabilities in the cyber domain.

**(3) Development and Securing of Human Resources**
In order to fundamentally strengthen the SDF’s cyber
defense capability, securing human resources who
possess sophisticated and wide-ranging knowledge
on cybersecurity is an urgent issue. Proactive efforts,
including the expansion of education and the utilization
of civilian knowledge, are necessary.
In this context, personnel are continuously and
by stages assigned to cyber-related departments, and
provided with both internal and external education in
order to acquire and maintain advanced knowledge and
skills.
As general education for all SDF services, the SDF
is conducting general cyber training to learn general
and advanced knowledge of cybersecurity. It is also
dispatching personnel to College of Information and
Cyberspace International Fellows at the National Defense
University of the United States and the U.S. Army’s
Coalition Cyber Operations Planner, and establishing
a specialized course in system and cyber engineering
at the JGSDF High Technical School. In FY2023, the
GSDF Signal School will be reorganized into the GSDF

System and Signal/Cyber School (tentative name) to
expand the educational infrastructure for training cyber
personnel, and the National Defense Academy will also
expand its cyber literacy education.
In addition, since July 2021, the MOD/SDF has been
hiring personnel with advanced knowledge and skills
as well as abundant experience and achievements in
the cyber domain as “Chief Cybersecurity Advisors.”
In addition, the MOD/SDF is also working on a publicprivate personnel exchange system to employ people
with practical experience in the private sector, as well
as utilizing external personnel through service contracts
and other means. Since FY2022, the MOD/SDF has
also begun recruiting candidates for SDF reserve
personnel with cybersecurity skills. In August 2022, the
Ministry of Defense Cyber Contest was held with the
aim of uncovering talented individuals with expertise in
cybersecurity.
Furthermore, since cybersecurity depends on the
literacy of personnel who use networks and systems, not
just specialized personnel with advanced knowledge, the
MOD/SDF is promoting literacy education, including
information assurance training, for general personnel
and administrative officers.


**(4) Contribution to the Whole-of-Government Approach**

Along with the National Police Agency, the
Digital Agency, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and
Communications, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the MOD,
as one of the government agencies that are members of
the Cybersecurity Strategy Headquarters, participates in
cyber-attack response training and personnel exchanges,
and provides information about cyber attacks, etc. to
the cross government initiatives led by the NISC as

well as sending personnel to the Cyber Incident Mobile
Assistance Team (CYMAT).[22] In addition, the MOD
is applying the knowledge and experience of the SDF


to penetration tests of the IT systems of Government
ministries and agencies conducted by the NISC, and
strengthening cooperation.

**Responses in the Domain of Electromagnetic Spectrum**
**6**


The domain of electromagnetic spectrum is at the forefront
of offense and defense in modern combat, with the scope
of its utilization and applications expanding to include
the land, sea, air, space, and cyber domains.[23] Therefore,
securing superiority in the electromagnetic domain is
extremely important for strengthening of deterrence and
the realization of cross-domain operations.
The SDF will steadily promote strengthening of its
capabilities in the domain of electromagnetic spectrum,
including effectively operating its electronic warfare
capabilities and related support capabilities while
impairing opponents’ operational capabilities in this area
even under challenging electromagnetic environments,
such as when encountering communication jamming
by opponents. Also, the entire SDF will utilize
the electromagnetic spectrum more efficiently by


strengthening its electromagnetic spectrum management
functions.
The MOD/SDF will closely cooperate with relevant
ministries and agencies to strengthen capabilities in
the electromagnetic domain so that the SDF can ensure
stable and flexible use of radio waves, balancing civilian
use of frequencies with the SDF’s use of frequencies
for the command and control and information gathering
activities.

See Part I, Chapter 4, Section 4-1 (Electromagnetic Domain and

Security)


Fig. III-1-4-12 Electronic Warfare Capabilities and Electromagnetic Spectrum Management Capabilities (image)

In order to effectively and proactively utilize electromagnetic spectrum, the following capabilities need to be enhanced.
1 Electronic warfare capabilities: capabilities to effectively and proactively utilize electromagnetic spectrum
2 Electromagnetic spectrum management capabilities: capabilities to appropriately manage and coordinate the use of electromagnetic spectrum by
ascertaining the status of electromagnetic spectrum in the theater and preventing interference with the aim of securing electronic warfare capabilities

23 One of the attacks using electromagnetic waves is an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack, which places an extreme burden on systems and electronics by generating instantaneous powerful
electromagnetic waves through nuclear explosions and other means, leading to their malfunction or destruction. Since this type of attack would impact not just the defense field but Japanese


-----

**1 Enhancing the Ability to Appropriately**
**Manage and Coordinate the Use of**
**Electromagnetic Spectrum**


In order to gain an advantage in warfare by using
electromagnetic spectrum proactively and effectively,
in addition to improving electronic warfare capabilities,
it is necessary to establish an electromagnetic spectrum
management posture that centrally grasps and coordinates
wave frequencies and status of use, and appropriately
allocates frequency resources to units, etc.
For this purpose, the electromagnetic spectrum
management function is being strengthened, such
as through research on electromagnetic spectrum
management support technologies to understand
the status of the electromagnetic spectrum used by
equipment communication devices, radar, and electronic
warfare devices, etc., and visualize them on monitors.

in capabilities in other domains and to accomplish the
defense of Japan.
For this reason, the MOD/SDF took measures to
reinforce the GSDF electronic warfare units in FY2022,
including by deploying electronic warfare units to Camp
Yonago (Tottori Prefecture) and other locations and will
continue to strengthen the GSDF electronic warfare
units in FY2023 and beyond. In addition, the MOD/SDF
will enhance the capabilities of the Network Electronic
Warfare System (NEWS), which functions to conduct
gathering and analysis of information from radio waves
on a regular basis, and neutralize the use of radio waves
by opponents during emergencies. Moreover, the MOD/
SDF will develop stand-off electronic warfare aircraft
that primarily jam aircraft communications and radar
from outside the opponent’s threat zone (stand-off
range).
Furthermore, the MOD/SDF will acquire equipment
for reflector-type decoy munitions for naval vessels. the
MOD/SDF will also acquire and conduct demonstration
research on high-power microwave (HPM) irradiation
equipment, operate high-energy vehicle-mounted laser
equipment, and promote research on high-energy laser
systems from the perspective of effectively dealing with
the threat of swarm attacks utilizing a large number of
drones.


In order to gain an advantage in fighting in the domain
of electromagnetic spectrum, it is important to gather
and analyze information on electromagnetic spectrum at
all phases from peacetime to armed contingencies and
appropriately share those among SDF units.
In FY2023, the SDF to acquire equipment such
as RC-2 signals intelligence aircraft with improved
capabilities, including an expanded range of frequency
reception bands.
The MOD/SDF will also continue to promote the
connection of each SDF service’s system, including the
DII.

the MOD/SDF is collecting the latest knowledge and
expertise in the electromagnetic domain by dispatching
personnel to participate in educational programs on
electronic warfare in the United States and other means.[24]

From February to March 2023, the MSDF dispatched
the multipurpose EP-3 aircraft to the United States for
the first time to conduct electromagnetic maneuver

the details of the ongoing case are not clear, the police
primarily respond to the situation, while the MOD/SDF
will collect relevant information and reinforce the security
of the SDF facilities. When the situation is clearer and can
be dealt with by the general police force, various forms
of assistance such as transportation of police officers and
provision of equipment to the police force may be carried
out as required. If the case cannot be dealt with by the
general police force, then public security operations by
the SDF will be implemented. Furthermore, if it has been
confirmed that an armed attack is being carried out against
Japan, the SDF will respond under a defense operation
order.
In addition, in response to ballistic missile attacks,
Aegis-equipped destroyers will be deployed to protect
the entire territory of Japan, and PAC-3s of the ASDF,
which are dispersed throughout the country to protect
bases, will be moved and deployed flexibly according
to the situation. Furthermore, Japan would respond to
cruise missiles and the like with a variety of anti-aircraft
missiles launched from aircraft, naval vessels, and
ground-based assets.

**2 Responses to Attacks by Guerillas and**
**Special Operations Forces**


**1 Basic Concept**

Unilateral changes to the status quo by force and
such attempts as well as invasion of Japan are not the
only situations that Japan needs to prepare for. Largescale terrorism and accompanying attacks on critical
infrastructure, such as nuclear power plants, are serious
threats to the lives, health, and property of Japanese
citizens, and would require Japan to respond with allout efforts. On the other hand, Japan also has a large
concentration of its industry, population, and information
infrastructure in urban areas, as well as the presence of
a large number of key facilities, such as nuclear power
plants, in coastal areas. Thus, protecting Japanese
citizens and critical facilities from various threats is also
a challenge.
In Japan, where most of the towns and cities are highly
urbanized, even small-scale infiltrations and attacks can
pose a serious threat against the country’s peace and
security. Such cases would involve various modes and
forms including illegal activities by infiltrated armed
agents,[25] etc., and sabotage carried out by guerillas or
special forces, which can be deemed to be armed attacks
against Japan.
To respond to such cases, the MOD/SDF would utilize
its fundamentally reinforced defense capabilities and
closely cooperate with the police, JCG, fire departments,
local governments, and other related organizations to
effectively respond to large-scale terrorism and attacks
on critical infrastructure.
In the stage where the actual situation of intruders and


Typical forms of attacks by guerrillas or special forces
include the destruction of critical private infrastructure
and other facilities, attacks against people, and
assassinations of dignitaries.
In dealing with attacks by guerrillas or special forces,


24 In addition, the MOD/SDF are advancing the multiplication of the communications network required for information sharing among the SDF services across Japan, and conducting research in light
of EMP protection.


-----

the MOD/SDF will respond with a particular emphasis
on the establishment of a relevant information gathering
posture, monitoring and surveillance to prevent invasions
in coastal areas, protection of key facilities, and search
and destruction of invading guerrillas or special forces.
Efforts will be made for early detection of attacks and
indications through monitoring and surveillance, and,
as required, the SDF units will be deployed to protect
key facilities, such as nuclear power plants, and the
necessary posture for protection will be established at an
early stage. Based on this, in the event of an infiltration
of our territory by guerrillas or special operations forces,
they will be searched for and detected by reconnaissance
units, aviation units and others, and combat units will be
promptly deployed to besiege and capture or to destroy
them.


See


Fig. III-1-4-13 (Example of Operations against the Attacks by
Guerillas and Special Forces)


**3 Response to Armed Agents**

**(1) Basic Concept**
While the police assume primary responsibility for
responding to illegal activities of armed agents, the SDF
will respond in accordance with situational developments.
If this happens, it is important for the SDF to cooperate
with the police force. Accordingly, with regard to public
security operations of the SDF, the Basic Agreement[26]
concerning cooperation procedures between the SDF
and the police, as well as local agreements between
GSDF divisions/brigades and prefectural police forces,
have been concluded.[27]

armed attack but against which the general police alone
cannot maintain public security, the SDF will conduct
public security operations to suppress the armed group
and rescue victims in cooperation with related agencies.
Furthermore, when the incident does not fall under
the category of defense operations or public security
operations, the chemical and medical protection units of
the GSDF and other units will cooperate with relevant
organizations in information gathering concerning
the extent of the damage, decontamination activities,
transportation of the sick and injured, and medical
activities through disaster relief and civil protection
dispatches.

**(2) Initiatives of the MOD/SDF**
The MOD/SDF possesses and maintains the GSDF
Central Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC)
Weapon Defense Unit and the Countermeasure Medical
Unit, and is also increasing the number of chemical and
medical protection unit personnel, in order to improve
the capability for responding to NBC weapon attacks.
Also, the GSDF has designated initial response personnel
who remain ready to mobilize quickly in the event of
extraordinary disasters.
The MSDF and the ASDF have also acquired
protective equipment and materials to be used on vessels
and at bases.


**Part**

**Chapter**


In recent years, there has been strong recognition of the
danger of NBC (Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical)
weapon proliferation, which can cause indiscriminate
mass casualties and contamination of an extensive area,
and the means for transporting such weapons, as well
as related equipment and materials, to terrorists and
countries under suspicion of proliferating such weapons.
The sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in March 1995
is one of the examples of an incident in which these
weapons were used.

**(1) Basic Concept**
In the event of the use of NBC weapons in Japan in a
way that corresponds to an armed attack, the SDF will
conduct defense operations to repel the armed attack
and rescue victims. In addition, in the event of the use of
NBC weapons in a way that does not correspond to an

points to consider in taking measures to protect civilians
depending on the type of attack.
As measures for civil protection during armed
attack situations and the like, the MOD/SDF will take
measures to confirm the damage, save lives, and assist in
the evacuation of residents, while cooperating with the
police, fire departments, JCG, and various other relevant
ministries and agencies.
The Government is conducting consideration from
the perspective that development of evacuation facilities
equipped with the necessary functions to protect the
lives and health of citizens from armed attack situations
where ballistic missiles and the like are used is a measure
for preventing damage, and leads to deterrence against
ballistic missile attacks and other attacks.


**1 Basic Concept**

There has recently been heightened interest in civil
protection as well as expectations for the MOD/SDF
due to North Korea’s repeated launches of ballistic
missiles in 2022, especially with the communication of
information via J-Alerts due to the launch of ballistic
missiles over the Japanese archipelago. Civil protection
is one of the pillars of the fundamental reinforcement of
defense capabilities in the NDS, and the MOD/SDF are
actively working on it.
In March 2005, based on Article 32 of the Civil
Protection Act, the Government established the Basic
Guidelines for the Protection of the People. It anticipates
four types of armed attack: (1) a land invasion, (2) an
attack by guerrillas or special forces, (3) a ballistic
missile attack and (4) an air attack It also lays out


-----

**(2) Daily Collaboration with Local Governments**
The MOD/SDF are establishing liaison departments in
Regional Armies and Provincial Cooperation Offices
to ensure daily and close collaboration with local
governments and other bodies.
Civil protection councils are established in prefectural
and municipal governments for comprehensive
implementation of civil protection measures.
Representatives of each branch of the SDF and Regional
Defense Bureau have been appointed to the councils.
Moreover, local governments are recruiting retired
SDF officers to serve as crisis managers. For example,
they act as coordinators with the MOD/SDF, as well as
play a role in developing and implementing response
plans and exercises.

**(3) Civil Protection Exercises**
In order to accurately and swiftly implement civil
protection measures, it is essential to establish posture
of cooperation with relevant organizations from
peacetime. The Government as a whole is strengthening
its civil protection exercises assuming armed attack
situations, etc. The MOD/SDF, in cooperation with
relevant ministries and agencies, host exercises with
the participation of local governments and others, and
actively participate and cooperate in civil protection
exercises conducted by relevant ministries and agencies
and local governments.

See Reference 20 (Participation of the MOD/SDF in Civil Protection

Joint Training Exercises with Central and Local Government
Bodies (2022))


**2 Initiatives of the MOD/SDF to Facilitate**
**Civil Protection Measures**

**(1) Enhancement of Posture for Civil Protection**
In order to counter invasions of Japan while protecting
the lives of Japanese citizens, it is imperative for national
government institutions, local governments, public
institutions, and private businesses to cooperate and
collaborate in an integrated manner.
To implement swift evacuation of residents, including
those in the southwestern region, well in advance of an
armed attack, the Government will promptly formulate
plans for smooth evacuation, secure means of public
and private transportation, develop and coordinate the
use of public infrastructure such as airports and sea
ports, secure various types of evacuation facilities, and
coordinate with international organizations. In addition,
in order to enhance the effectiveness of such efforts,
the Government will conduct and verify various types
of training, including evacuation of residents, and then
consider necessary measures, including institutional
aspects, while promoting cooperation among the
national government, local governments, designated
public institutions, and others.
Moreover, in addition to participating in and
cooperating with these measures, the SDF will also
coordinate and cooperate in the planned implementation
of civil protection measures utilizing civilian vessels
and aircraft used by the SDF and various SDF transport
assets. The SDF will also promote various measures
such as strengthening SDF units that can also provide
civil protection and utilizing SDF reserve personnel.

**3 Initiatives in Response to Unauthorized**
**Disclosure of Classified Information**

The MOD/SDF have been working to ensure a system
necessary for information security in accordance with
the Act on the Protection of Specially Designated
Secrets and other relevant laws, and in cooperation with
relevant ministries, agencies, and bureaus, in order to
appropriately protect various types of highly classified
information.
However, it came to light that the Commander of
the MSDF Fleet Intelligence Command intentionally
disclosed without authorization specially designated
secrets and other information to his former superior,
who was not eligible to handle classified information,
in a situation briefing conducted on March 19, 2020,
thereby violating the Act on the Protection of Specially
Designated Secrets and Article 59, Paragraph 1 (duty of
confidentiality) of the Self-Defense Forces Law.
This is the first case of unauthorized disclosure of
specially designated secrets since the enactment of the
Act on the Protection of Specially Designated Secrets in
2014. Unauthorized disclosure of classified information
must not be allowed in the MOD/SDF, which should be
in the position to properly protect classified information
necessary for the defense of Japan.
Taking this incident seriously, the Minister of Defense
issued instructions to prevent recurrence. In addition,
the “Committee for Studying Recurrence Prevention
of Unauthorized Disclosure of Classified Information
including Specially Designated Secrets,” chaired by the
State Minister of Defense, was established to eradicate
similar cases of unauthorized disclosure of classified
information and to consider more effective concrete
measures to prevent recurrence.
The Committee conducted serious consideration on
more effective concrete measures to prevent recurrence,
including guidelines for meetings with former MOD
personnel, in order to eradicate similar cases of
unauthorized disclosure of classified information. The
results of the consideration were compiled, and on
March 31, 2023, the Minister of Defense made personnel
thoroughly aware of measures taken to prevent recurrence
in response to the unauthorized disclosure case.
Based on the recent measures to prevent recurrence, the
MOD/SDF continue to further reinforce information security.

Japan needs to establish a system that enables realtime intelligence sharing by making maximum use of
various means, including artificial intelligence (AI), and
further strengthening intelligence collection and analysis
capabilities. Japan also needs to continuously and
accurately grasp the intentions and capabilities of our
surrounding countries and others more than ever before.
Therefore, in order to effectively collect, organize,
analyze, share, and preserve intelligence, and to
contribute to policy decisions and force operations,
Japan will strengthen its capabilities by function for
signals intelligence (SIGINT), imagery intelligence
(IMINT), human intelligence (HUMINT), and OSINT,
centered on the Defense Intelligence Headquarters,
while fundamentally enhancing our integrated analysis
capabilities, including the use of geospatial intelligence
(GEOINT). In order for the intelligence division to
respond appropriately to increasingly diversified
intelligence requirements, the MOD/SDF are promoting
the securing and training of highly capable personnel
handling intelligence collection and analysis. Moreover,
the MOD/SDF are taking steady measures in various
directions including recruitment, education, training,
and personnel allocation to strengthen comprehensive
intelligence collection and analysis capabilities.
Furthermore, the MOD/SDF will promote cooperation
and collaboration with relevant domestic organizations
related to intelligence, and take necessary measures to
make more effective use of intelligence collected by IGS
in SDF operations.

together for their mission.
Specifically, they conduct comprehensive analysis
on international situations that change day by day from
diverse perspectives, including military, political and
economic factors, based on information received from a
wide range of sources including SIGINT, IMINT, OSINT
(newspapers, internet, etc.) and opinion exchange with
relevant parties.
The Defense Intelligence Headquarters is also
strengthening information gathering and analyzing
functions in new domains such as space, cyber and the
electromagnetic spectrum. For example, it conducts
the collection and analysis of necessary information
regarding trends in threats in cyberspace through such
means as collecting OSINT and exchanging information
with other countries. In addition, the Defense Intelligence
Headquarters increased the number of personnel in
FY2022 in order to strengthen its system for gathering
and analyzing information on the economic security of
other countries.
Results of the Defense Intelligence Headquarters’
intelligence service are provided as analysis products to
the Prime Minister, the Minister of Defense, the National
Security Secretariat established within the Cabinet
Secretariat, the Cabinet Intelligence and Research Office,
as well as GSDF, MSDF and ASDF units in a timely and
appropriate manner to support policy decision and unit
operation. The Defense Intelligence Headquarters also
actively exchanges information with relevant ministries
and agencies and foreign counterparts.


**4 Defense Intelligence Headquarters**

**(1) Mission of the Defense Intelligence Headquarters**
The Defense Intelligence Headquarters is the central
intelligence agency of the MOD and the largest
intelligence agency of Japan. It was established in 1997
in order to develop a framework for sophisticated and
comprehensive intelligence collection and analysis in the
increasingly complicated security environment following
the Cold War. The DIH gathers SIGINT, IMINT,
GEOINT, OSINT, etc., and analyzes international and
military situations, and other matters related to Japan’s
swiftly changing security environment.
In addition to intelligence collection and analysis,
the Headquarters is also considered in the NDS to play
a central role in responding to Integrated Information
Warfare for the defense of Japan, and is to fundamentally
strengthen the capabilities to collect, analyze, and
disseminate information on international military
situations and other issues.

dimension, with a focus on detecting and analyzing
disinformation and promptly and appropriately
disseminating information.
Due to various acts being committed in the international
community in the name of information warfare, it is
important to clearly state the outer limits for responding
to Integrated Information Warfare to be implemented
from the perspective of the defense of Japan in order to
ensure credibility both domestically and overseas.
Specifically, Integrated Information Warfare with special
regard to the cognitive dimension refers to the following
three measures undertaken during emergencies as well
as the current stage from the perspective of the defense
of Japan: (1) acquiring diverse intelligence collection
capabilities by strengthening intelligence functions, (2)
determining the veracity and intentions of all threats,
including disinformation spread by other countries, and
neutralizing them or taking other measures through various
means and (3) deterring and responding to unilateral
changes to the status quo by force and building a more
desirable security environment, while protecting Japan’s
decision-making through measures such as the rapid
and strategic dissemination of appropriate information
at every opportunity in cooperation with our ally, likeminded countries, and others. Furthermore, Japan will
not implement efforts that damage our credibility (such as
dissemination of disinformation via social media and other
means, manipulation of public opinion, conspiracy, etc.).
In the MOD, the Defense Intelligence Headquarters
plays a central role in responding to such Integrated
Information Warfare and the MOD as a whole will


develop intelligence capabilities that can reliably deal
with Integrated Information Warfare with special regard to
the cognitive dimension by 2027. Specifically, the MOD
will continuously collect information on developments in
other countries (such as by ensuring diverse intelligence
collection capabilities), determine the veracity of
information disseminated by other countries, etc. (by
detecting propaganda and disinformation and factchecking disinformation), and take every opportunity
to create an environment favorable to Japan (such as by
maintaining strategic and information communication
infrastructure, information security, etc.).
The Defense Intelligence Headquarters, which plays
a central role in responding to Integrated Information
Warfare, will take necessary measures at all stages
of collection, analysis, and dissemination in close
cooperation with the policy and operations divisions,
such as:

- Strengthening the system for information collection,
analysis, and dissemination

- Establishing automatic collection and analysis
functions for OSINT using artificial intelligence (AI),
which will enable continuous collection and analysis of
information on developments in various countries and
other matters

- Developing a function that automatically collects social
media information and other information to determine
the veracity of information disseminated by various
countries

- Exchanging information with relevant organizations.

and stably, the MOD/SDF will encourage the defense
industry to expand its domestic manufacturing capacity
and strengthen the maintenance posture for the various
ammunitions. In addition, in order to accommodate the
increasing ammunition size and meet the increasing
storage requirements for ammunitions, the MOD/SDF
will promote the expansion of ammunition storage
facilities and the disposal of unused ammunitions.

See Fig. III-1-6-1 (Examples of Major Ammunition and Magazines)


**2 Efforts to Secure Ammunition**

In the NDS calls for Japan will resolve the situation of
ammunition shortage by FY2027. Japan will promptly
procure the required quantities of various ammunitions,
including high-priority stand-off missiles such as the
upgraded Type 12 surface-to-ship missile, interceptor
missiles for ballistic missile defense (SM-3 Block
IIA), interceptor missiles with upgraded capabilities
(PAC-3MSE), long-range ship-to-air missiles (SM-6),
and upgraded Type 03 medium-range surface-to-air
guided missiles (modified). Specifically, ammunition
development costs, which were approximately 1 trillion
yen in the previous Medium Term Defense Program, will
be increased five-fold to approximately 5 trillion yen
over the next five years during the period of the DBP

**Securing Fuel**
**2**

The MOD/SDF will secure the necessary amount of
fuel for SDF operations. In addition, in order to secure
the required fuel quickly and stably, the MOD/SDF
will build new fuel tanks while also renting private fuel
tanks. For example, maintenance of fuel tanks in the
MSDF has been carried out in stages based on actual
use and existing tank capacity, but this has given rise to


restrictions on unit operations. Therefore, as a measure
to make up for the shortage of fuel for ships, private
tanks with the capacity to handle storage as well as
acceptance and delivery operations throughout the year
will be rented.
In addition, the MOD/SDF will secure the necessary
quantities of food and clothing.

cases due to parts shortages. For some equipment, socalled “cannibalization maintenance,” in which parts are
removed from an equipment that is not operational and
diverted to other equipment, it requires twice as much
maintenance work as normal parts replacement due to
the removal and installation of parts, thereby imposing
an excessive burden on units in the field.

See Fig. III-1-6-2 (Classification of Equipment Availability)

**2 Increasing the Number of Operationally**
**Available Defense Equipment**


**1 Current Status of the Number of**
**Operationally Available Equipment**

Equipment used by the SDF emphasizes performance
over durability and is used under harsher conditions than
civilian products. It thus has characteristics that result
in more frequent maintenance and parts replacement
compared to equipment for general use. Therefore, it is
necessary to maintain a certain quantity of spare parts in
anticipation of parts replacement.
On the other hand, as equipment has become more
advanced and achieved higher performance, the unit
procurement cost of parts and costs for sustainment and
maintenance have risen, and while there have also been
increases in maintenance budgets, such increases have not
always been sufficient, resulting in some non-operational


**(1) Securing Parts**
By securing the necessary budget for maintenance and
materials, with lead time taken into consideration, while
dealing with the increasing sophistication and complexity
of defense equipment, the MOD/SDF will eliminate nonoperational state caused by parts shortages and maximize
the number of operationally available equipment by
FY2027. To this end, the precision of supply and demand
forecasts will be improved by upgrading logisticsrelated systems, such as by adding a function to supply
management systems to estimate the demand for parts
using AI, while the time it takes for units to receive
parts will be shortened by distributing parts efficiently
throughout the SDF through the maintenance of adequate
inventory. In addition, major supply warehouses will be
renovated to become automated, manpower-saving, and
systematized to enable accurate inventory control and
prompt supply of parts according to unit needs.

-----

**(2) Promotion of Outsourcing**
In increasing the number of operationally available
equipment, the MOD/SDF will promote the outsourcing
of sustainment, maintenance and other operations to
outside parties in order to make effective use of limited
resources.
For some equipment, the MOD/SDF is conducting
outsourcing efforts aimed at reducing the number
of inspection and maintenance items by analyzing
maintenance plans, collecting the necessary data, and
other such actions. The MOD/SDF will further promote
efforts for more efficient sustainment and maintenance,
such as unit maintenance and parts repair of equipment
that utilize the results of such outsourcing efforts.
Through these efforts, the MOD/SDF will increase the
number of operationally available equipment while
reducing the burden on units, especially on personnel
engaged in sustainment and maintenance work.

**(3) Introduction of Digital Transformation (DX)**
In order to efficiently carry out various types of
operations, it is necessary to drastically transform
the way operations are conducted through digital
transformation (DX) based on the development of the
latest digital infrastructure and other means. In addition,
the MOD/SDF will promote the introduction of DX in


the logistics support field to optimize maintenance and
upkeep. Specifically, in addition to the introduction of AIbased supply management systems, the MOD/SDF will
optimize its maintenance posture in the logistics support
field by improving the efficiency of inventory control and
other aspects by using the results of demonstration tests
for the introduction of Radio Frequency Identification
(RFID), an automatic authentication technology that
uses radio waves to read and write information on IC
tags in a contactless manner to allow the inventory status
of parts and other items to be grasped more accurately, as
well as 3D printers, which can be used for the emergency
manufacturing of equipment parts and other items.

**(4) Expansion of Performance Based Logistics (PBL)[2]**
**and Other Comprehensive Contracts**

After concluding a PBL contract for aircraft from
FY2012, the MOD/SDF has been expanding the scope of
such contracts beyond aircraft, including the conclusion
of a PBL contract for gas turbine engines for naval
vessels in FY2021. The MOD/SDF will work to expand
the scope of PBL contracts, which will improve the
operational availability of equipment, while verifying
their cost-effectiveness in order to achieve effective and
efficient sustainment and maintenance.

It is important to ensure sufficient functioning of SDF
facilities, which are the foundation for the sustainability
and resiliency of Japan’s defense capabilities. Because
about 40% of SDF facilities were built during periods
when the old earthquake resistance standards were in
effect, it is necessary to transform these facilities into
ones that can ensure the safety of SDF personnel on a
daily basis and prevent the easy loss of operational
capabilities even in a contingency.
In addition, in conjunction with the acquisition of
various types of ammunition required for continuous
unit operations, it is necessary to secure ammunition
storage facilities. At the same time, the MOD/SDF
will adopt various measures to improve resiliency in a
multi-layered way by dispersing the infrastructure for


SDF operations as well as by restoring and replacing
infrastructure when it is damaged.

**1 Securing Ammunition Storage Facilities**


In conjunction with the acquisition of various types of
ammunition, including stand-off missiles, the SDF will
secure the necessary ammunition storage facilities. In
securing the ammunition storage facilities, the SDF will
pursue and promote efficient joint operations between
the GSDF, the MSDF, and the ASDF, joint use of U.S.
ammunition storage facilities, and dispersed deployment
to islands from the viewpoint of ensuring the resiliency
of ammunition.

MOD/SDF will establish underground basing, reinforce
facilities, and take measures against electromagnetic
pulse (EMP) attacks, such as installing filters on power
lines, for major command posts, construct dispersal pads
for the dispersed deployment of fighter aircraft, build
hardened alert shelters, and establish redundancy for
utility infrastructures such as electricity and water in
order to maintain their functionality. In addition, the base
security function will be strengthened while reducing the
number of personnel.

In order to prevent the functional decline of SDF
facilities in the event of large-scale disaster, the MOD/
SDF will promote countermeasures against disasters
such as tsunamis for bases and camps that are expected
to be damaged. Specifically, the MOD/SDF will take
measures such as locating transforming equipment on
high ground and installing watertight panels at entrances
and exits. In the future, the SDF will improve the
resiliency of defense facilities and infrastructure in bases
and camps in order to adapt and respond appropriately to
various challenges associated with climate change and to
fulfill the SDF’s missions and roles.


During the period of the current DBP, the MOD/
SDF will continue to develop the facilities necessary
for the formation of new units and the introduction
of new equipment. Specifically, this will include the
development of facilities for the GSDF’s new Camp Saga
(tentative name), the development of facilities in Sasebo
(Sakibe East Area (tentative name)) for the MSDF, and
the development of facilities for receiving the ASDF’s
F-35 (A and B) aircraft.

**(5) Formulating Plans for Responding to Various**
**Disasters**

The MOD/SDF establish basic items for actions to be
taken by the SDF in the event of various disasters based
on the Ministry of Defense Disaster Prevention Plan in
order to take all possible measures for the initial response
by promptly transporting and deploying units as well as
to respond to large-scale earthquakes, which are under
consideration by the Central Disaster Management
Council. With this, the MOD/SDF formulate various
contingency plans to respond to such earthquakes with the
aim of implementation of swift, systematic disaster relief.
Based on the damage assumptions for a megaquake in
the Japan Trench or the Chishima Trench as well as the
Basic Plan for Promotion of Disaster Management for
Trench-type Earthquakes in the Vicinity of the Japan and
Chishima Trenches announced by the Cabinet Office, the
Self-Defense Forces Contingency Plan for Responses to
Trench-type Earthquakes in the Vicinity of the Japan and
Chishima Trenches was formulated in FY2022.

**(6) Collaboration with Local Governments and Other**
**Relevant Organizations**

It is important for the MOD/SDF to strengthen
collaboration with local governments and other relevant
organizations under normal circumstances for the purpose
of conducting disaster relief operations smoothly. For this
reason, the SDF implements various measures including:
(1) Assignment of the post of Liaison Officer for Civil
Protection and Disaster Management (administrative
official) at the SDF Provincial Cooperation Offices;
(2) Temporary assignment of SDF officers to the
department in charge of disaster prevention at the
Tokyo Metropolitan Government, and mutual exchange
between administrative officials of both the GSDF
Middle Army and Hyogo Prefectural Government; and
(3) Recommendation of retired SDF personnel with
knowledge in disaster prevention in accordance with
requests from local governments.
As of the end of March 2023, as many as 640 retired
uniformed SDF personnel are working in disaster
prevention and other sections in 455 local governments
in 46 prefectures throughout the country. Such
cooperation in human resources is a very effective way
of strengthening collaboration between the MOD/SDF
and local governments, and its efficacy was confirmed
through the responses to various kinds of disasters. In
particular each GSDF regional army headquarters


suspected to have outbreaks. These missions engaged a
cumulative total of around 33,000 personnel.
E. Disaster Relief in Response to Forest Fires
Of the forest fires that broke out between April 2022
and the end of March 2023, local authorities conducted
firefighting operations but were unable to extinguish
fires in four prefectures (Aomori, Fukushima, Tochigi,
and Miyazaki prefectures). Based on disaster relief
requests issued by the governors of each prefecture, the
SDF conducted aerial firefighting and other operations.
The SDF dispatched a cumulative total of about 1,300
personnel, about 140 vehicles, and about 50 aircraft.

See Reference 21 (Record of Disaster Relief (Past Five Years))

**(2) Transportation of Emergency Patients**
The SDF uses its aircraft to transport emergency patients
from isolated islands and remote areas with insufficient
medical facilities (transportation of emergency patients).
In FY2022, out of a total of 381 cases of disaster relief,
317 cases involved the transportation of emergency
patients, with dispatches to remote islands such as
the Southwestern Islands (Okinawa and Kagoshima
Prefectures), the Ogasawara Islands (Tokyo), and remote
islands of Nagasaki Prefecture representing the majority
of such cases.

**(3) Responses to Maritime Accidents**
On April 23, 2022, the 1st Regional Coast Guard
Headquarters issued a disaster relief request to the ASDF
to search for persons in need of rescue due to a tour boat
accident off the coast of Shiretoko, Hokkaido, and the
request was accepted on the same day. From April 23
to June 1, search and rescue activities were conducted
by aircraft and naval vessels of the GSDF, MSDF, and
ASDF.

**(4) Responses to Nuclear Disasters**
In order to respond to nuclear disasters, the MOD/SDF
has formulated “The SDF Nuclear Disaster Response
Plan.” The SDF also participates in general nuclear
disaster prevention drills jointly implemented by the
government, local governments, and nuclear operators,
to confirm the effectiveness of municipal governments’
evacuation plan and to strengthen cooperation with
relevant agencies in a nuclear disaster emergency.

establishes a forum for interaction with senior directors
for crisis management and other officials from local
governments, and shares information and exchanges
opinions to strengthen collaboration with those local
governments.
In the event of a disaster, liaison officers are sent
quickly from the units to the local governments in order
to ensure smooth coordination.

**(7) Actions Based on the Five-Year Acceleration**
**Measures for Disaster Prevention, Mitigation, and**
**Building National Resilience**

In December 2020, the five-year acceleration measures
for disaster prevention, mitigation, and building national
resilience[1] were approved by the Cabinet. Under the
measures, the MOD intensively focuses on measures for
mechanical equipment materials, etc., at SDF airfield
facilities and others, measures for enhancing the SDF’s
infrastructure, and measures for strengthening the SDF’s
buildings, etc., from the perspective of maintaining


and strengthening functions including important
infrastructure for disaster prevention.

**3 Impact on Various Trainings due to**
**Disaster Relief Activities**


Large-scale and long-term disaster relief activities have
been increasing in recent years, and originally planned
training cannot be conducted during these disaster relief
activities, which sometimes hinders the training plans.
In the future, the MOD/SDF will make the utmost
effort to respond to life-saving activities during the
initial response, and with regards to the various types
of emergency assistance, etc., the MOD/SDF will
coordinate the role sharing, response guidelines, activity
periods, and utilization of private companies, etc., with
the relevant parties such as local governments and the
relevant ministries and agencies. The posture will be
shifted as needed, and activities will be carried out at an
appropriate posture and scale.

**Chapter**


**1 Basic Concept**


In the event of natural disasters, turmoil, and other
emergencies overseas, the Minister of Defense can order
SDF units to protect and rescue or transport Japanese
nationals and other people overseas upon request from
the Minister for Foreign Affairs and upon subsequent
consultations with the Minister, under the provisions of
Article 84-3 (Rescue of Japanese Nationals Overseas)
or Article 84-4 (Transportation of Japanese Nationals
Overseas) of the Self-Defense Forces Law.

**2 Initiatives of the MOD/SDF**


For prompt and appropriate implementation of rescue or
transportation of Japanese nationals overseas, the SDF
has prepared to dispatch its units swiftly. Specifically,
each SDF designates the necessary personnel and units


Inside an ASDF C-2 transport aircraft flying from Sudan to Djibouti


In light of the increasingly severe and frequent occurrence of weather disasters due to climate change, the imminence of large-scale earthquakes such as a Nankai Trough earthquake, as well as the
aging of infrastructure that was intensively developed from Japan’s period of rapid economic growth, it is necessary to accelerate and deepen efforts for disaster prevention and mitigation as well as
building national resilience. It is also essential to utilize digital technology to efficiently promote measures for building national resilience. To this end, efforts are being made for further acceleration
and deepening of measures in the fields of “countermeasures against increasingly severe wind and flood damage, imminent large-scale earthquakes, etc.,” “acceleration of aging countermeasures
towards a shift to preventive maintenance of infrastructure,” and “promotion of digitization, etc. to efficiently advance measures related to national resiliency.” The scale of additional projects required


-----

Since these activities require close coordination
among the GSDF, MSDF and ASDF, the MOD/SDF
conducts joint exercises on a regular basis. From August
to September 2022, the SDF conducted training in Japan
with related organizations for the transportation of
Japanese nationals overseas to practice the entire process
of the actions of units and coordination with the related
organizations, which improved integrated operational
capabilities and strengthened cooperation with the related
organizations. Furthermore, from February to March
2023, the MOD/SDF took advantage of the opportunity
of the annual multilateral joint exercise Cobra Gold in
Thailand to rehearse on a series of activities for rescue
of Japanese nationals overseas in cooperation with the
relevant ministries and the Embassy of Japan in Thailand.
The exercise strengthened the cooperation between the
MOD/SDF and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The MOD/SDF has transported Japanese nationals
overseas six times. Most recently, Japanese nationals and
others were transported from the Republic of Sudan in
April 2023, which was the first case after the amendment
of Article 84-4 of the Self-Defense Forces Law. In this
case, considering the situation in the Republic of Sudan,
the Minister for Foreign Affairs requested the Minister of
Defense on April 19 to take preparatory actions necessary
for the transportation of Japanese nationals and others
staying in the country. On April 20, the Minister of


Defense issued an order for the ASDF transport aircraft
to move to the Republic of Djibouti and stand by. In
response, the “Joint Task Force for the Transportation
of Japanese Nationals and others from the Republic of
Sudan” was formed with the Commander of the ASDF
Air Support Command as its commander. From April 21,
C-130 transport aircraft, C-2 transport aircraft, and KC767 aerial refueling and transport aircraft departed for
the Republic of Djibouti in sequence.
On April 23, upon request from the Minister for Foreign
Affairs for the transportation of Japanese nationals and
others from the Republic of Sudan, the Minister of Defense
issued an order to conduct transport activities on the same
day. On April 24 (local time), one C-2 transport aircraft
carried 45 Japanese nationals and their families from the
Republic of Sudan to the Republic of Djibouti. Through
this operation, two C-130 transport aircraft, two C-2
transport aircraft, one KC-767 aerial refueling and transport
aircraft, and approximately 180 personnel were dispatched
to the Republic of Djibouti. Later, on April 28, the Minister
of Defense issued an order to terminate the operation upon
request from the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

In November 2022, the coordinated asset protection
among Japan, the U.S., and Australia was conducted
for the first time. This took place on the occasion of a
trilateral joint exercise during which MSDF vessels

security of the world and has strong economic ties.
Specifically, Japan and the United States will take
bilateral action in the event of an armed attack against
Japan, based on the provisions of Article 5 of the JapanU.S. Security Treaty, and Japan will provide facilities
and areas for the U.S. Forces, based on the provisions of
Article 6 of the treaty. If a nation plans to attack Japan,
the attacker must be prepared to confront not only the
defense capability of the Self-Defense Forces (SDF), but
also the overwhelming military strength of the United
States, due to the U.S. obligation to defend Japan. As a
result, the opposing nation clearly recognizes that it will
suffer grievously if it carries out an invasion, and such
desires will be abandoned at the planning stage. In other
words, this serves as deterrence against attacks.
Japan intends to create a seamless posture and
secure its peace and security by effectively utilizing the
deterrence capabilities of the U.S. military together with
Japan’s own national defense architecture.

**2 Maintenance of Peace and Stability in**
**the Region surrounding Japan**


Security Arrangements constitutes the foundation of the
United States’ commitment to the peace and stability
of the region surrounding Japan. These arrangements,
complemented by the alliances established between
the United States and other countries in the region such
as the Republic of Korea (ROK), Australia, Thailand,
and the Philippines, and also by the friendly relations
developed with other countries, play an indispensable
role in maintaining the peace and stability of the region.

**3 Responding to Global Issues**


**Part**
**Ⅲ**

**Chapter**


The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements are the
foundation for a comprehensive and friendly cooperative
relationship between Japan and the United States,
not only in defense but also in a wide range of areas,
including politics, economy, and society.
The Japan-U.S. Alliance, with the Japan-U.S.
Security Arrangements at its core, also forms the axis of
Japan’s foreign policy. It contributes to Japan’s ability
to implement positive efforts to maintain the peace
and security of the international community, including
the promotion of multinational security dialogue and
cooperation, and cooperation with the United Nations.
Currently, we are confronted with global security
challenges that are difficult for any countries to tackle
alone, including risks concerning stable use of the seas,
outer space and cyberspace, acts of piracy, proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles,
and international terrorism, and it is important for
countries to work together from peacetime. The strong
bonds forged between Japan and the United States are
also playing an important role in the efforts implemented
by Japan to effectively respond to such challenges.
In particular, under the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements, the SDF and the U.S. Forces are
working together in peacetime from a variety of areas to
strengthen their cooperation. This close coordination lays
the foundation for various forms of global collaboration
such as counter-piracy, undertaken by the SDF and the
U.S. Forces, and leads to enhancement of the operational
effectiveness of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.
The peace and prosperity of the international
community are closely linked to those of Japan.
Accordingly, by advancing initiatives for resolving
global issues in cooperation with the United States,
which has remarkable operational capabilities, Japan
will be able to further ensure its security and prosperity


Article 6 of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty states that
the purpose of the use of facilities and areas by the U.S.
Forces in Japan is to contribute to the security of Japan
and the maintenance of international peace and security
in the Far East. This provision is based on the recognition
that the security of Japan is closely tied to the peace and
security of the Far East region to which Japan belongs.
In the regions surrounding Japan, there are many
states and the like with massive military power,
including some that retain nuclear weapons or continue
nuclear development. In addition, uncertainty over the
existing order is increasing due to changes in the balance
of power. The so-called gray-zone situations harbor the
risk of rapidly developing into graver situations without
showing clear indications.
In such security environment, the presence of U.S.
forces in Japan provides deterrence against unexpected
contingencies caused by various security issues or
destabilizing factors, not only protecting the interests of
Japan and the United States but also providing a great
sense of security to the nations in the region and thus
fulfilling a role as public goods.
Also the close cooperation based on the Japan U S

**Content of the Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation**
**2**


The “Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation”
(the Guidelines), which show the general outline and
policy direction of roles and cooperation between Japan
and the United States, were formulated in 1978, and
successively revised in 1997 and 2015.
The current Guidelines, which were revised in 2015,
update the general framework and policy direction for
the roles and missions of the two countries, as well as
modernizing the Alliance. The Guidelines also manifest
a strategic vision for a more robust Alliance and greater
shared responsibilities by enhancing its deterrence and
response capabilities in all phases, from peacetime to
contingencies.

See Reference 24 (The Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense

See

Cooperation (April 27, 2015), (September 23, 1997))
(provisional translation); Reference 25 (Chronology of the
Japan-U.S. Alliance); Fig. III-2-1-1 (Outline of the Guidelines
for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation)


**1 Strengthening Japan-U.S. Defense**
**Cooperation**

The Guidelines define that Japan and the United States
will work on a variety of measures during peacetime,
including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
(ISR) activities, air and missile defense, maritime
security, training and exercises, asset protection, and
logistics support, and cooperate in such activities as
response to a large-scale disaster in Japan to seamlessly
ensure Japan’s peace and security.
The Guidelines also require both countries: to cooperate
in international activities and promote and improve trilateral
and multilateral cooperation for regional and global
peace and security; to cooperate on space and cyberspace;
and to develop and enhance bilateral enterprise through
defense equipment and technology cooperation as well
as intelligence cooperation and information security for
further improving the effectiveness of bilateral cooperation.

**Policy Consultations between Japan and the United States**
**3**


Japan and the United States have maintained close
coordination at multiple levels, including the summit
level and ministerial level, and have continually
strengthened and expanded cooperative relations for the
peace, stability and prosperity not only for the two
countries but also for the entire international community,
including the Indo-Pacific region.
Close policy consultations on security are conducted
through ordinary diplomatic channels as well as between
officials in charge of defense and foreign affairs at
multiple levels in the Governments of Japan and the
United States through meetings such as the JapanU.S. Security Consultative Committee (SCC, or “2+2”
Meeting), the Japan-U.S. Security Subcommittee (SSC),
and the Subcommittee for Defense Cooperation (SDC).
As the framework for ministerial consultations among
the top officials in charge of defense and foreign affairs
of the two countries, the “2+2” Meeting represents such
policy consultations, and functions as an important
consultative panel to discuss issues related to Japan-U.S.
cooperation in the area of security.
In addition the Ministry of Defense (MOD) organizes


Discussion between then Vice-Minister of Defense Suzuki and Deputy Secretary of Defense Dr. Hicks

Japan-U.S. defense ministerial meetings between the
Japanese Minister of Defense and the U.S. Secretary
of Defense as necessary where discussions are made
with a focus on the defense policies of the respective
governments and defense cooperation. Furthermore,
MOD officials, including the Administrative ViceMinister of Defense, the Chief of Staff of the Joint Staff,
the Vice Minister of Defense for International Affairs


-----

and the Chiefs of Staff of the SDF, have working-level
meetings when necessary and exchange necessary
information. For example, in January 2023, a meeting
was held between Defense Minister Hamada and
Secretary of Defense Austin. In April of the same year,
then Vice-Minister of Defense Suzuki held consultations
with Deputy Secretary of Defense Dr. Hicks and Under
Secretary of Defense for Policy Dr. Kahl.
Such sharing of information and views at every
opportunity and level between Japan and the United
States is conducive to the increased credibility of the
Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, and results in the


further enhancement of close collaboration between
the two countries. Therefore, the MOD is proactively
engaging in these initiatives.

**Integrated Air and Missile Defense**

Regarding the response to airborne threats coming to
Japan, such as ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and
aircraft, Japan-U.S. bilateral response capabilities have
been enhanced by conducting Japan-U.S. joint air
defense/missile defense exercises in addition to sharing
operational information and establishing response
procedures. In addition, Japan and the United States
are cooperating in the event of North Korea’s repeated


ballistic missile launches by utilizing the Alliance
Coordination Mechanism (ACM).
In the Missile Defense Review (MDR) released in
October 2022, the United States clearly indicated the
importance of cooperation with allies, including Japan.

**Bilateral Training and Exercises**
**3**


Japan-U.S. bilateral training and exercises in peacetime
not only contribute greatly to maintaining and
enhancing bilateral response capabilities by improving
interoperability, including mutual understanding of
tactics and communication, but are also beneficial for
improving tactical skills for each participant. In particular,
the knowledge and techniques that the Japanese side
learns from the U.S. Forces, which have vast experience
in actual fighting, are invaluable and greatly contribute
to improving SDF capabilities.


In addition, conducting bilateral training at effective
times, places, and scales demonstrates the unified
commitment and capabilities of Japan and the United
States, which has a deterrent effect. In light of these
perspectives, the MOD/SDF is continuing its initiatives
to enrich the contents of bilateral training and exercises.

See Part IV, Chapter 3, Section 1 (Training and Exercise Initiatives);

Reference 29 (Record of Main Japan-U.S. Bilateral Exercises
in FY2022)



**Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Activities**
**4**


With regard to joint ISR activities, it is important to
implement such activities broadly in the Asia-Pacific
region with cooperation between Japan and the United
States to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the
activities of both countries.
The expansion of these bilateral ISR activities
will function as deterrence, and will also ensure
information superiority over other nations and enable
the establishment of a seamless cooperation structure
throughout all phases from peacetime to contingencies.
As part of these efforts, the temporary deployment of
the U.S. Forces’ MQ-9 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)
to the Kanoya Air Base of the Maritime Self-Defense
Force (MSDF) began in November 2022. In addition, the
Japan-U.S. Bilateral Information Analysis Cell (BIAC)
was established at Yokota Air Base in order to jointly


analyze information collected by Japanese and U.S.
information gathering assets, including MQ-9.


See


Column “Temporary Deployment of U.S. Forces’ UAV MQ-9 to
Kanoya Air Base”

**Logistics Support**
**5**

Japan-U.S. cooperation is also being steadily promoted
through logistics support based on the Japan-U.S.
Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA)
signed in 1996 and revised in 1999 and 2004. The
Agreement is designed to positively contribute to the
smooth and effective operation under the Japan-U.S.
Security Treaty and to initiatives for international peace
taken under the leadership of the United Nations (UN).
Its scope of application includes various occasions
such as bilateral training and exercises in peacetime,
disaster relief activities, international peace cooperation
assignments, international disaster relief activities,
and armed attack situations. If either the SDF or the
U.S. Forces request the other party to provide supplies


or services, the Agreement, in principle, allows the
requested party to do so.[1]

Following the passage of the Legislation for Peace and
Security in September 2015, the new Japan-U.S. ACSA
was signed in September 2016, ratified by the Diet in
April 2017, and entered into force. This has enabled the
same framework as the existing Japan-U.S. ACSA, such
as settlement procedures, to be applied to the provision
of supplies and services that had become possible under
the Legislation for Peace and Security, so that since April
2017 food and fuel have been provided to the U.S. Forces
engaged in information collection and other activities.

(Kagoshima Prefecture) began in November 2022 as part of
an initiative to improve the intelligence-gathering capabilities
of the Japan-U.S. Alliance. The deployment period is one year,
during which time eight MQ-9s and approximately 150 to 200
U.S. military personnel will be temporarily deployed. This is an
extremely important initiative for preventing and suppressing
provocative actions against Japan and attempts to change
the status quo by neighboring countries. Also, the Japan-U.S.
Bilateral Information Analysis Cell (BIAC) was established to
jointly analyze information collected by U.S. and Japanese
intelligence-gathering assets, including MQ-9s.
From the perspective of ensuring the safety and peace
of mind of local residents, the Kyushu Defense Bureau
Kanoya Liaison Office was established at Kanoya Air Base in
August 2022 to respond to inquiries from local residents and MQ-9 temporarily deployed at Kanoya Air Base


The categories of supplies and services as provided under the Agreement include: food; water; billeting; transportation (including airlifts); petroleum, oils, and lubricants; clothing; communications;
medical services; base support; storage services; use of facilities; training services; spare parts and components; repair and maintenance services; airport and seaport services; and ammunition

**Joint/Shared Use**
**6**


The expansion of joint/shared use of facilities and areas
also means increasing bases for the SDF’s activities such as
maneuver areas, ports, and airfields, which in turn enables
closer operational coordination, enhanced interoperability,
and improved flexibility and resiliency during bilateral
activities. The SDF has only a limited number of facilities
in Okinawa, including Naha Air Base of the Air SelfDefense Force (ASDF), and most of them are located in
urban areas, which results in operational limitations. The
joint/shared use of facilities and areas of the U.S. Forces
in Japan (USFJ) in Okinawa will greatly improve the
SDF’s training environment in Okinawa, and facilitate
implementation of bilateral training and exercises as well
as enhance interoperability between the SDF and the U.S.
Forces. It will also improve readiness and contribute to
ensuring the safety of local people in case of a disaster.
Thus, while taking into account the SDF defense
posture in the regions, including the Southwestern Islands,
and relations with local communities, Japan and the

Fig. III-2-2-1 Japan-U.S. Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA)


Significance of reciprocal provision of supplies and services


United States are proactively engaged in consultations,
and specific initiatives are steadily progressing. For
example, the Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) has
been using Camp Hansen since March 2008 for training.
Moreover, the relocation of the ASDF Air Defense
Command Headquarters to Yokota in April 2012 and the
relocation of the then GSDF Central Readiness Force
Headquarters to Zama in March 2013 were carried out.
In addition, the development of training ranges in Guam
and the Northern Mariana Islands (Tinian Island, Pagan
Island, etc.) for shared use by the SDF and the U.S.
Forces is under consideration.
Moreover, securing ammunition storage is an
important issue for acquiring the various types of
ammunition necessary to ensure and maintain sufficient
war fighting sustainability, and specific coordination
has begun for additional joint/shared use of ammunition
storage by the SDF within the Kadena Ammunition
Storage Area, a facility and area of the USFJ.

**Chapter**


In general, supplies and services necessary for unit operations are replenished by the units themselves. However, in such cases
where allied nations are operating together, the reciprocal provision of supplies and services on site would enhance the flexibility of
the operations.

realignment-related costs refer to the costs relating to the measures that contribute to reducing the impact on local communities as a part of the realignment initiatives. On
the other hand, since HNS (Cost sharing for the stationing of USFJ) is Japan’s voluntary effort to bear some costs in light of the importance of ensuring the smooth and
effective implementation of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, its nature is different from the SACO-related costs and the realignment-related costs, and is categorized
separately.

3 The costs for the stationing of USFJ include the MOD-related budget, other ministry-related budgets (base subsidy, etc.: ¥40.5 billion, FY2022 budget) and the estimated

costs of government-owned land provided for use as USFJ facilities (¥164.3 billion, FY2022 estimate).

**(3) Supplementary Agreement on Cooperation in the**
**Field of Environmental Stewardship**

In September 2015, the governments of Japan and the
United States signed the Agreement on Cooperation in
the Field of Environmental Stewardship relating to the
USFJ, supplementary to the SOFA, which came into
force on the same day. This supplementary agreement
represents an international commitment with legal
binding force and sets forth provisions concerning the
issuance and maintenance of the Japan Environmental
Governing Standards (JEGS) and the establishment and
maintenance, etc., of procedures for access to USFJ
facilities and areas.

See Part IV, Chapter 4, Section 2-2 (Initiatives Related to USFJ

**(4) Supplementary Agreement on Civilian Component**
In January 2017, the governments of Japan and the
United States signed the Supplementary Agreement on
Civilian Component, which came into force on the same
day. This Supplementary Agreement clarifies the scope
of the civilian component which is addressed only by


when the U.S. Forces use SDF facilities for a limited
period, for example, during Japan-U.S. bilateral training.

**(2) Satisfying Labor Requirements of the USFJ**
The SOFA stipulates that the manpower (labor) required
by the USFJ shall be satisfied with the assistance of the
Government of Japan.
As of the end of FY2022, there were 25,897 USFJ
local employees (hereinafter referred to as the “USFJ
employees”) at USFJ facilities and areas throughout
Japan, working as clerks at headquarters, engineers at
maintenance/supply facilities, members of security
guards and fire departments on base, and sales staff at
welfare/recreational facilities. They support the smooth
operations of the USFJ.
The Government of Japan hires these USFJ employees
in accordance with the provisions of the SOFA. The
MOD supports the stationing of the USFJ by performing
administrative work for personnel management, payment
of wages, health care, and welfare, etc.

criteria used in evaluating contractor employee positions
for eligibility to receive designation as members of the
civilian component, and stipulates the procedures for
notification and review, etc., together with the exclusion
of ordinary residents from the civilian component.

**3 USFJ-Related Costs**


since the mid-1970s, and changes in the international
economic situation, Japan began to bear labor costs such
as welfare costs for USFJ local employees in FY1978.
Then in FY1979, it started to bear costs for the Facilities
Improvement Program, or FIP.
In addition, as labor costs soared due to changes in
economic conditions surrounding both countries, there
arose a concern that the employment stability of the
employees would be undermined, and then the activities
of the USFJ could be affected. Therefore, in 1987, Japan
and the United States concluded an agreement that
sets forth special measures regarding Article 24 of the
SOFA (the Special Measures Agreement, or SMA)[5] as
exceptional, limited, and provisional measures relating
to the cost sharing principle of the SOFA.
Based on this SMA, Japan started to bear labor costs
of eight categories such as the adjustment allowance
(currently replaced by the regional allowance). As the
SMA was revised later on, the costs shared by Japan
have expanded to cover labor costs including base pay,
and utilities costs from FY1991, training relocation costs
from FY1996, and training equipment and materials
procurement costs from FY2022.


USFJ-related costs include Host Nation Support, or
HNS (cost sharing for the stationing of USFJ), costs
for implementing the stipulations of the Special Action
Committee on Okinawa (SACO) Final Report to mitigate
the impact on the people of Okinawa, as well as costs
for implementing measures that contribute to mitigating
the impact on the local communities associated with the
initiatives for the realignment of the U.S. Forces.

Based on the consensus that these costs will build the foundation to further strengthen the Japan-U.S. Alliance as a result of the negotiations surrounding the SMA agreed upon on December 21,
2021, the Japanese side has decided to refer to this budget by a Japanese phrase that points to its goal of enhancing Alliance readiness and resiliency.

**Efforts for the Realignment of the USFJ**
**2**


“2+2” Meeting in January 2023, Japan and the United
States decided to optimize the posture of the U.S. forces
by further enhancing the force posture of the USFJ to
have more versatile, resilient, and mobile capabilities,
and by readjusting the Realignment Plan that was
adjusted in 2012. Specifically, it was agreed that the
3rd Marine Division Headquarters and the 12th Marine
Regiment will remain in Okinawa, and that the 12th
Marine Regiment will be reorganized into the Marine
Littoral Regiment by 2025.
In readjusting the Realignment Plan, the basic
tenets of the current Realignment Plan are maintained,
with utmost consideration to mitigate the impact on
Okinawa. Specifically, Japan and the United States have
confirmed that (1) the number of U.S. Marine Corps
personnel in Okinawa after the realignment will remain
to be approximately 10,000; (2) the realignment will not
affect the lands scheduled to be returned in the Okinawa
Consolidation Plan, nor will it affect the progress of the
FRF at Camp Schwab; and (3) there will be no change
in the commencement of the relocation of Marine Corps
personnel from Okinawa to Guam, which will begin in
2024.
Combined with the enhanced capabilities and posture
of the SDF, this initiative will greatly enhance the
deterrence and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S.
Alliance. Japan will continue to hold close consultations
to further optimize the posture of the USFJ.

**2 Progress of the Realignment of the USFJ**


**1 USFJ Realignment Plan**

**(1) Background and Overview**
“The United States-Japan Roadmap for Realignment
Implementation” (Roadmap) was set forth in May 2006.
Subsequently, the following factors were set forth: (1)
the necessity of implementing measures to realize visible
mitigation of the impact on Okinawa promptly and
steadily; (2) the necessity of balancing the Realignment
Plan and the strategic rebalance to the Asia-Pacific
region, which was set out in the U.S. Defense Strategic
Guidance released in January 2012; and (3) the reduction
in the cost associated with the relocation of the U.S.
Marine Corps to Guam demanded by the U.S. Congress.
The Realignment Plan was coordinated during the April
2012 “2+2” Meeting in light of those factors.
The 2006 Roadmap stated that among the III Marine
Expeditionary Force (MEF) stationed in Okinawa,
the main focus of the relocation to Guam would be the
command elements. However, the United States decided
to alter the composition of the units and to deploy the
Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF), consisting of
command, ground, aviation and logistics support elements,
in Japan, Guam, and Hawaii, as well as in Australia as a
rotational unit. In addition, the governments of Japan and
the United States decided to delink both the relocation of
U.S. Marine Corps personnel from Okinawa to Guam and
the resulting land returns south of Kadena Air Base from
the progress on the Futenma Replacement Facility (FRF).

will continue to make all efforts to provide careful
explanations to local residents in Okinawa building upon
years of persistent dialogue.
The return of MCAS Futenma is expected to eliminate
danger in the area and to contribute to the further growth
of Okinawa, including Ginowan City, through the reuse
of the area (approximately 476 ha, a land area around
100 times larger than Tokyo Dome).

**(1) Relocation of MCAS Futenma and Mitigation of**
**the Impact on Okinawa**

The relocation of MCAS Futenma holds more
significance than merely moving the facility from one
location to another. Rather, it involves reduction in the
base’s functions and area in Okinawa, and contributes
greatly to mitigating the impact on Okinawa.
a. Distribution of Functions Offered by MCAS Futenma
The relocation of MCAS Futenma involves the return
of the entire area by relocating three functions: (1)
operation of the Osprey and other aircraft, (2) operation
of air refueling aircraft, and (3) accepting transient
aircraft in contingencies. Of these three functions, (2)
and (3) involve relocation out of Okinawa Prefecture,
while (1) involves relocation to Camp Schwab.
The relocation of “(2) operation of air refueling
aircraft” to MCAS Iwakuni in Yamaguchi Prefecture was
completed in August 2014. With regard to “(3) accepting
transient aircraft in contingencies,” Japan and the United
States agreed in October 2018 to develop facilities
that would be necessary for relocating the function to
Tsuiki Air Base in Fukuoka Prefecture and Nyutabaru
Air Base in Miyazaki Prefecture. The construction work
was completed by March 2023 except for the runway
extension at Tsuiki Air Base. The MOD will continue
to proceed with environmental impact assessments, etc.
related to the runway extension work at Tsuiki Air Base.
b. Reduction in Area
The area required for the land reclamation to build the
FRF is approximately 150 ha, less than one-third of the
approximately 476 ha of MCAS Futenma, and the FRF
will be equipped with a significantly shorter runway at
1,200 m (1,800 m including the overruns) compared to
the current runway length of 2,740 m at MCAS Futenma.
c. Reduction in Noise and Risks
Two runways will be constructed in a V-shape, which
enables the flight path for takeoff and landing to be
located over the sea, in line with the requests of the
local community In MCAS Futenma flight paths used


**3 Field-Carrier Landing Practice (FCLP)**


The May 2006 Roadmap prescribes that a bilateral
framework to conduct a study on a permanent FCLP
facility is to be established with the goal of selecting a
permanent site at the earliest possible date. The MOD has
acquired most of the land on Mageshima, Nishinoomote
City, Kagoshima Prefecture, and has been explaining
the facility development to the local communities of
Kagoshima Prefecture, Nishinoomote City, Nakatane
Town, and Minamitane Town.
The United States also welcomed the Government of
Japan’s decision to develop SDF facilities on Mageshima
in the joint statement issued in January 2022. The
FY2022 budget included funds for facility development
of the runways and parking apron on Mageshima.
In January 2023, the MOD released the environmental
impact assessment report prepared based on the view of
the Governor of Kagoshima Prefecture, who had taken
into account the opinions of the mayors of Nishinoomote
City, Nakatane Town and Minamitane Town, and others,
and started the construction work within Mageshima. In
March of the same year, construction work also began
on the maritime area around Mageshima, and efforts of
developing facilities are steadily progressing.

**4** **Relocation and Return of MCAS Futenma**


**Part**
**Ⅲ**

**Chapter**


Although over 25 years have passed since Japan and
the United States agreed on the total return of the site
of MCAS Futenma, it has not been achieved yet. The
MOD believes that the return must not be postponed any
longer.
The fundamental idea shared by the Government of
Japan and the people of Okinawa is that it is imperative
not to allow MCAS Futenma to remain indefinitely at
its current location, which is in the vicinity of houses
and schools, in the center of Ginowan City, Okinawa
Prefecture.
There is no change to the Government of Japan’s
view that the current plan to relocate MCAS Futenma to
Henoko, Nago City is the only solution to avoid continued
use of the Air Station. This has been confirmed by the
Japanese and U.S. governments on repeated occasions,
including at the “2+2” Meetings and joint statements at
Japan-U.S. summit meetings.
In order to achieve the total return of MCAS
Futenma as early as possible the Government of Japan

daily for training and other purposes are located over
residential areas, whereas flight paths in the FRF will
be changed to over the sea, thereby reducing noise and
risks.
For example, while more than 10,000 households are
located in areas requiring housing noise insulation near
MCAS Futenma, there will be zero households requiring
such insulation around the FRF.

**(2) Background Concerning the Futenma**
**Replacement Facility**

Considering the occurrence of the U.S. Forces helicopter
crash in Ginowan City in August 2004, bilateral
discussions on the realignment have been made towards
realizing the relocation and return of MCAS Futenma at
the earliest possible date in order to resolve the concern
of the residents living in the vicinity.
The SCC (“2+2”) joint statement compiled
in October 2005 calls for locating the FRF in an
L-shaped configuration. However, after that, based on
consultations and agreement with the local governments
including Nago City, it was decided to stipulate in
the June 2006 Roadmap that the FRF be located in a
V-shaped configuration. With regard to construction
of this replacement facility, a Memorandum of Basic
Understanding was exchanged between then Governor
of Okinawa Prefecture Inamine and then Minister of
State for Defense Nukaga in May 2006.
After the change of government in September 2009,
the Exploratory Committee for Okinawa Base Issues was
established. After reviews conducted by the Committee,
at the “2+2” Meeting held in May 2010, the governments
of Japan and the United States confirmed the intention to
locate the FRF in the Camp Schwab Henokosaki area and
the adjacent waters. Subsequently, at the “2+2” Meeting
held in June 2011, it was decided that the runway would
take a V shape.
During the deliberation process which led to these
conclusions, first of all, it was determined that, from a
security perspective, the deterrence of the U.S. Forces,
including that of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in


Okinawa that is located in a crucial area for the security of
Japan, cannot be lessened while there remains instability
and uncertainty in the security environment in East Asia.
Furthermore, concern was expressed that the functions
of the U.S. Marine Corps, such as mobility and readiness,
would be weakened if the helicopter units stationed at
MCAS Futenma were to be detached from the other
Marines units stationed in Okinawa and moved abroad
or out of the prefecture. This is because the U.S. Marine
Corps conducts integrated operations of air, ground,
logistics support, and command elements.
Therefore, it was concluded that the FRF had to be
located within Okinawa Prefecture.

See Reference 32 (Background of the Futenma Replacement

Facility); Reference 33 (Estimated Timelines for the Return
of Facilities and Areas South of Kadena); Fig. III-2-5-4
(Comparison between the Replacement Facility and MCAS
Futenma (image))

**(3) Promotion of the FRF Construction Project**
a. Progress of Landfill Work
The Director General of the Okinawa Defense Bureau
submitted the Landfill Permit Request on public
waters to Okinawa Prefecture in March 2013, and then
Governor of Okinawa Prefecture Nakaima approved this
in December 2013.
After the construction began, then Governor of
Okinawa Prefecture Onaga revoked the landfill permit,
which led to litigation between the Government of Japan
and Okinawa Prefecture. However, landfill work began
in the waters south of Camp Schwab in December 2018.
In August 2021, the landfill work from sea level to 4.0
m was completed. We have been making steady progress
on landfill work. (As of May 2023)
b. Consideration on Soil Improvement Work, Etc.
Regarding the soil foundation of the landfill area, a study
was conducted on the stability of seawalls and other
structures in the waters north of Camp Schwab in light
of the results of a boring survey, etc. As a result, it was
confirmed that it is possible to implement the construction
of seawalls and landfill work while ensuring the required
stability through soil improvement work via prevailing

c. Environmental Protection Initiatives
An environmental impact assessment was conducted
for approximately five years from 2007 for the
FRF construction project. For this assessment, the
MOD received 1,561 opinions from the Governor of
Okinawa Prefecture, made all the required revisions,


and appropriately reflected them in the content of the
environmental impact assessment report.
The assessment report states that because corals
inhabiting the landfill area will be lost due to the landfill
work, corals will be transplanted to the extent possible as

measures will also be taken for the remaining targeted
corals in the future. The project employs a greater scope
for preservation so as to be more careful in transplanting
corals than that employed during the landfill work for
the construction of the second runway at Naha Airport.[7]

d. Landfill Permit Revision Request on Public Waters
Hearing experts’ insights on the environment and other
aspects, after due consideration, in April 2020, the
Okinawa Defense Bureau submitted to the Governor
of Okinawa Prefecture the Landfill Permit Revision
Request given the additional implementation of the soil
improvement work, etc., based on the Act on Reclamation
of Publicly-owned Water Surface.
In November 2021, the Governor of Okinawa Prefecture


The standard methods are the sand compaction pile method, the sand drain method, and the paper drain method. Among examples of projects in which these methods were used is the construction
work to expand Tokyo International Airport (Haneda Airport).

Specifically, in relation to the construction of the second runway of Naha Airport, around 37,000 clusters of small corals were transplanted. If the same standard as the one applicable to the


-----

disapproved the Permit Revision Request on the grounds
that surveys of the soil foundation and environmental
protection measures at the planned landfill area were
inadequate. In response, in December 2021, the Director
General of the Okinawa Defense Bureau filed a request for
review with the Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport
and Tourism under the Administrative Complaint Review
Act. In April 2022, the Minister of Land, Infrastructure,
Transport and Tourism determined revocation of the
disapproval by the Governor of Okinawa Prefecture, and
also issued an instruction for correction based on the Local
Autonomy Act to approve the Permit Revision Request.
Dissatisfied with this determination and the instruction
for correction, the Governor of Okinawa Prefecture
respectively filed requests for review with the Central and
Local Government Dispute Management Council in May
2022. In response to the dismissal by the Central and Local
Government Dispute Management Council of the request
for review regarding the determination in July 2022, the
Governor of Okinawa Prefecture filed a lawsuit with the
Naha Branch of the Fukuoka High Court in August 2022 to
revoke the Government’s involvement (the determination
by the Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and
Tourism). In addition, in response to the decision by the
Central and Local Government Dispute Management
Council that the instruction for correction was not illegal,
the Governor of Okinawa Prefecture filed a lawsuit in
the same month with the Naha Branch of the Fukuoka
High Court to revoke the Government’s involvement
(the instructions for correction by the Minister of Land,
Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism). Regarding these
lawsuits, in March 2023, the Naha Branch of the Fukuoka
High Court rendered respective judgments dismissing
the lawsuit by the Governor of Okinawa Prefecture over
the determination and the instruction for correction. The
Governor of Okinawa Prefecture filed a petition of final
appeal with the Supreme Court regarding these lawsuits.
In addition, in September 2022, due to dissatisfaction with
the determination of the Minister of Land, Infrastructure,

Transport and Tourism, Okinawa Prefecture filed a lawsuit
with the Naha District Court to revoke the determination
based on the Administrative Case Litigation Act. Thus,
three lawsuits are pending between the Government
of Japan and Okinawa Prefecture regarding the Permit
Revision Request (as of May 2023).


**5** **Return of Land Areas South of Kadena Air Base**

The May 2006 Roadmap stated that, following the
relocation to the FRF, the return of MCAS Futenma, and
the transfer of III MEF personnel to Guam, the remaining
facilities and areas on Okinawa will be consolidated,

thereby enabling the return of significant land areas
south of Kadena Air Base.
Subsequently, at the “2+2” Meeting in April 2012, it
was decided to delink the progress on the relocation to the
FRF from both the relocation of the III MEF personnel
from Okinawa to Guam and the resulting land returns
south of Kadena. In addition, with regard to the land
to be returned, it was agreed to conduct consultations
focusing on three categories, namely (1) land eligible
for immediate return; (2) land eligible for return once
the relocation of functions is completed; and (3) land
eligible for return after the relocation abroad.

**(1) Consolidation Plan for Facilities and Areas in**
**Okinawa**

Since the change of administration at the end of 2012,
Japan and the United States have continued consultation
under the basic policy to dedicate all strength toward
mitigating the impact of the U.S. Forces on Okinawa
communities. Japan strongly requested an early return
of land areas south of Kadena, including Makiminato
Service Area (Camp Kinser) in Urasoe City of which
Okinawa has particularly made a strong request for
the return and coordinated with the United States. As
a result, both countries announced the Consolidation
Plan for Facilities and Areas in Okinawa (Consolidation
Plan) in April 2013, which stipulated the return schedule,
including the specific years of return.
The return of all land according to the plan will enable
the return of approximately 70% (approximately 1,048
ha, the equivalent of 220 Tokyo Domes) of six USFJ
facilities for exclusive use[8] located in densely populated
areas in the central and southern parts of the main island
of Okinawa. In the Consolidation Plan, it is confirmed
between Japan and the United States that this plan
will be implemented as soon as possible, and that the
Government will continue to make the utmost efforts to
return the land south of Kadena, at an early date.

procedures are completed” in the Consolidation Plan
(shown in red in Fig. III-2-5-7 (Return of Land Areas
South of Kadena Air Base (image))) was realized. The
use of returned lands is being promoted incrementally.
For example, at the former site of the West Futenma
Housing Area, which was returned in March 2015, the
formation of Okinawa Health Medical Center requested
by the local community is being promoted.
In addition, returns have been realized ahead of
the schedule in the Consolidation Plan for some areas
where there were strong demands for return by the
local community. This has resulted, for example, in
the opening of the entire stretch of Ginowan City road
11 in March 2021 on land along the east side of MCAS
Futenma, which has improved local traffic. Furthermore,
in May 2022, Prime Minister Kishida visited the Lower
Plaza Housing area of Camp Zukeran and announced that
Japan and the United States will agree to open the area as
a green space for public use ahead of its return to Japan.
All-out initiatives are being continuously made by
the Government to steadily implement the return of land
areas south of Kadena Air Base under the Consolidation
Plan in a manner that visibly mitigates the impact on
Okinawa.

As part of measures based on this Agreement,
the Government of Japan has been providing cash
contributions to the U.S. Government in relation to the
projects for which Japan has provided financial support
since FY2009.[9]

Subsequently, at the “2+2” Meeting held in April
2012, the unit composition and the number of personnel
to be relocated to Guam were adjusted and it was
agreed that the preliminary cost estimate by the U.S.
Government for the relocation was US$8.6 billion (in
U.S. FY2012 dollars). With regard to Japan’s financial
commitment, it was reaffirmed that it was to be the
direct cash contribution of up to US$2.8 billion (in
U.S. FY2008 dollars) as stipulated in Article 1 of the
Guam International Agreement. It was also confirmed
that Japan’s equity investment and loans for family
housing projects and infrastructure projects would not
be utilized.[10]

Moreover, it was stipulated that any funds that had
already been provided to the U.S. Government under

**6 Relocation of the Marine Corps to Guam**

Since the Roadmap was announced in May 2006, the
governments of Japan and the United States held a series
of consultations on the reduction of the U.S. Forces in
Okinawa.


**Part**
**Ⅲ**

**Chapter**


**(1) Timing and Size of Relocation**
The 2006 Roadmap stated that approximately 8,000
personnel of the III MEF and their approximately 9,000
dependents would relocate from Okinawa to Guam by
2014, but the “2+2” Meeting in June 2011 and other
agreements set the timing of the relocation for the earliest
possible date after 2014.
Subsequently, at the “2+2” Meeting held in April 2012,
the governments of Japan and the United States decided
to delink both the relocation of III MEF personnel from
Okinawa to Guam and the resulting land return south of
Kadena from the progress on the FRF and to adjust the
composition of the units and the number of personnel to
be relocated to Guam.
As a result, the MAGTF is to be located in Japan,
Guam, and Hawaii, with approximately 9,000 personnel
relocated to locations outside of Japan. Meanwhile, the
end-state for the U.S. Marine Corps presence in Okinawa
is to be consistent with the level of approximately 10,000
personnel envisioned in the Roadmap.
Accordingly, the “2+2” Meeting held in October
2013 agreed that, under the relocation plan described at
the 2012 “2+2” Meeting, the relocation of U.S. Marine
Corps units from Okinawa to Guam is to begin in the
first half of the 2020s. The plan is expected to facilitate
progress in implementing the Consolidation Plan for
Facilities and Areas in Okinawa of April 2013.
In addition, at the “2+2” Meeting in January 2023,
it was confirmed that the relocation from Okinawa to
Guam would begin in 2024.

**(2) Costs of the Relocation**
Under the Roadmap, the two sides reached an
agreement that, of the estimated US$10.27 billion (in
U.S. fiscal year 2008 dollars) cost of the facilities and
infrastructure development costs, Japan would provide
US$6.09 billion, including US$2.8 billion in direct


9 As for projects for which Japan provides financial support, cash contributions totaling approximately 372.1 billion yen (including the use of interest generated from the funds provided) have been
provided to the U.S. side using the budgets from FY2009 to FY2022.

10 In line with this, the special provisions for the operations of the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (investment and loan) that had been prescribed by the Act on Special Measures on Smooth

the Guam International Agreement would be counted
as part of the Japanese contribution. Furthermore, as a
new initiative, a portion of the direct cash contribution
of US$2.8 billion mentioned above would be used to
develop training areas in Guam and the Commonwealth
of the Northern Mariana Islands as shared-use facilities
by Japan and the United States. In addition, it was agreed
that the remaining costs and any additional costs would be
borne by the United States, and that the two governments
were to complete a bilateral cost breakdown.
At the “2+2” Meeting in October 2013, a Protocol
Amending the Guam International Agreement was also


signed to add the stipulations concerning the development
of training areas in Guam and the Commonwealth
of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the use of these
training areas by the SDFs. The limit on Japanese cash
contributions remains unchanged at US$2.8 billion (in
U.S. FY2008 dollars).

**(3) Completion of Environmental Impact Assessment**
**Procedures**

As for the environmental impact assessment for Guam,
the required procedures were conducted to reflect the
revisions to the project made by the adjustments to the


-----

plan for realignment, and the assessment was completed
in August 2015.
Furthermore, the Commonwealth of the Northern
Mariana Islands Joint Military Training Environmental
Impact Statement (CJMT-EIS), is now being implemented.

**(4) Progress of the Guam Relocation Project**
While the environmental impact assessment for Guam
was being conducted, the Government of the United States
implemented infrastructure development projects at the
Andersen Air Force Base and the Apra area of the Naval
Base Guam as projects unaffected by the assessment. The
U.S. Government is currently implementing relocation
construction work in all project areas, following the
lifting of the freeze on the Guam relocation funds
pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act and
the completion of the environmental impact assessment
for Guam.

between the two countries, and also to relocating part
of air-to-ground training conducted by using Kadena
Air Base. Thus, this training relocation will help noise
abatement around Kadena Air Base, thereby contributing
to the mitigation of the impact on Okinawa.
In addition to assisting the USFJ, the MOD/SDF
is making efforts to ensure the safety and security of
the local community, such as the establishment of a
liaison office, facilitating communication with related
government agencies, and response to requirements
from the local community. These efforts have been
contributing to successful training relocation.

See Fig. III-2-5-9 (Overview of the Background to the Aviation

Training Relocation)

b. Training Relocation for MV-22
The Government of Japan and the United States
Government decided in the “2+2” joint statement of
October 2013, to utilize the opportunities to participate
in various operations in mainland Japan and across
the region to reduce the amount of time that MV-22s
are deployed and used for the training in Okinawa so
that training outside of Okinawa Prefecture, including
mainland Japan, can be increased while maintaining
the deterrence of the Alliance. Based on above, both
governments have been moving forward with the training
of the MV-22 deployed at MCAS Futenma outside of
Okinawa Prefecture, etc.
In September 2016, it was agreed at the Joint
Committee to relocate the training activities of TiltRotor/Rotary Wing aircraft, such as AH-1, CH53, and the
MV-22 that are currently deployed at MCAS Futenma
out of Okinawa Prefecture at Japan’s expense in order to
further promote training outside of Okinawa to mitigate
the impact of training activities there.
In FY2022, the MV-22 and other aircraft were
included in Japan-U.S. bilateral training upon being
relocated to maneuver areas and other locations in
Hokkaido Prefecture in October 2022, in Nagasaki,
Kumamoto, and Kagoshima prefectures in November of
the same year, and in Kumamoto, Oita, and Kagoshima
prefectures from February to March 2023. From the
date of the agreement up to March 2023, a total of 18
exercises, in addition to the ones mentioned above,
have been conducted in Guam as well as in Japan at
the maneuver areas in Aomori, Iwate, Miyagi, Gunma,
Kanagawa, Niigata, Shizuoka, Shiga, Kagawa, and

Based on the decision that U.S. aircraft from three USFJ
facilities and areas – Kadena, Misawa (Misawa City
and Tohoku Town in Aomori Prefecture) and MCAS
Iwakuni – would participate for the time being in
bilateral training at SDF facilities, the Aviation Training
Relocation (ATR)[11] has been underway since 2007. The
MOD has been improving its infrastructure, as required,
for the training relocation.
The ATR contributes to enhancing interoperability

Miyazaki prefectures.
The MV-22’s amount of time deployed and training
in Okinawa will continue to be reduced by relocating
exercises held in mainland of Japan and Guam, and the
government will continue to promote initiatives that
contribute to further mitigating the impact on Okinawa


Furthermore, with regard to the safety of MV-22s,
prior to the deployment of MV-22s to MCAS Futenma
in 2012, Japan established an analysis and assessment
team composed of aircraft pilots and experts from inside
and outside the Government and confirmed the safety of
MV 22 independently In addition when Japan made the


-----

decision to introduce Ospreys in 2014, the Government
reconfirmed their safety by collecting and analyzing all
kinds of technical information, not only in the preparation
phase, but also after the decision of introduction.
Furthermore, the MOD has dispatched GSDF Osprey
personnel to the U.S. Marine Corps’ training programs
since 2016, in which they reaffirmed that the Osprey is
a reliable aircraft that allows for stable maneuvering and
maintenance by operating and maintaining the actual
airframe.
Additionally, the CV-22 has the same propulsion
system as the MV-22 and both aircraft have a common
basic structure. Therefore, the safety of both aircraft is at
the same level.
Japan considers that ensuring safety is of prime
importance in operations of the U.S. Forces, and on
various occasions, the Minister of Defense requested
the U.S. Secretary of Defense and other high-ranking
officials to give consideration to local communities and
ensure safety. The Government of Japan will continue to
ask for the maximum consideration for safety.

C Usability of Osprey Deployed by the U.S. Forces in
Case of Disaster
In the aftermath of the devastating typhoon that hit the
central part of the Philippines in November 2013, 14
MV-22 aircraft, deployed in Okinawa, were dispatched
for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief activities
to support Operation Damayan. The MV-22s were
deployed promptly to affected areas that were difficult
to access, and transported several hundred isolated
victims and about six tons of relief materials in a day.
In April 2014, an MV-22 aircraft deployed in Okinawa
was dispatched for search and rescue activities when
a passenger ship sank in an accident off the coast of
Jindo in the ROK. Furthermore, in response to the large
earthquake that hit Nepal in April 2015, four MV-22s
deployed in Okinawa were dispatched to the country to
transport personnel and supplies.
In Japan as well, when the Kumamoto Earthquake
occurred in 2016, MV-22s were dispatched to deliver
daily necessities to the disaster-stricken areas.
In this manner, the MV-22 is capable of conducting
humanitarian assistance and disaster relief activities
immediately and over a large range when large-scale
disasters occur because of its high performance and
multifunctionality It has also been used for disaster


prevention drills since 2014. In September 2016, two
MV-22s participated in the comprehensive disaster
prevention drills of Sasebo City, Nagasaki Prefecture and
conducted delivery drills for isolated islands. Like the
MV-22, the CV-22 can conduct humanitarian assistance
and disaster relief activities, including search and rescue
missions, both immediately and over a large range, in the
case of a large-scale disaster.
As such, it is expected that the superior capabilities
of the Osprey deployed by the U.S. Forces can be
showcased in a variety of operations in the future as well.

**8 Initiatives for Smooth Implementation of**
**the Realignment of the USFJ**


**Part**
**Ⅲ**

**Chapter**


In order to smoothly implement the realignment of the
USFJ based on the May 2006 Roadmap, the Act on
Special Measures on Smooth Implementation of the
Realignment of United States Forces in Japan (USFJ
Realignment Special Measures Act) was enacted in
August 2007. Realignment grants, Special Subsidy Rates
for Public Projects, and other systems were established
based on the law.
In addition, under the U.S. Forces realignment, some
USFJ facilities and areas will be returned, and the U.S.
Marine Corps in Okinawa will be relocated to Guam.
Since these developments may affect the employment
of USFJ employees, the Government of Japan will take
measures to include education and skills training, which
is to help retain their employment.
The Realignment Special Measures Act was supposed
to cease to be effective as of March 31, 2017. However,
since there remain realignment projects that require
implementation, on March 31, 2017, an act revising part
of the Act including a 10-year extension of the time limit
to March 31, 2027 was enacted.

with a wide range of missions with high mobility and
readiness, along with the above-mentioned geographical
characteristics, further ensures the effectiveness of
the Japan-U.S. Alliance, strengthens deterrence, and
contributes greatly not only to the security of Japan but
also to the peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.
On the other hand, Okinawa has many USFJ facilities
and areas such as air bases, maneuver areas, and
logistics facilities. As of January 1, 2023, approximately
70% of USFJ facilities and areas (for exclusive use)
are concentrated in Okinawa Prefecture, occupying
approximately 8% of the land area of the prefecture
and approximately 14% of the main island of Okinawa.
Therefore, it is necessary to make utmost efforts to
mitigate the impact on Okinawa, while also considering
the above-mentioned security standpoints.

**(1) Initiatives for Realignment, Consolidation, and**
**Reduction of USFJ Facilities and Areas in Okinawa**

When Okinawa was returned to Japan in 1972, the
Government of Japan provided 83 facilities and areas
covering approximately 278 km2 for exclusive use
as USFJ facilities and areas. On the other hand, USFJ
facilities and areas were strongly requested to be
realigned, consolidated and reduced, on the grounds that
their concentration in Okinawa seriously affect the lives
of the people in Okinawa.
Both countries have continued their initiatives to
realign, consolidate, and reduce USFJ facilities and
areas, centering on those subject to strong local requests,
and, in relation to the so-called 23 issues, it was agreed
in 1990 that both sides would proceed with the required
coordination and procedures toward the return of land.
Moreover, it was agreed in 1995 that efforts would also
be made to resolve the so-called Three Okinawa Issues:
the return of Naha Port (Naha City), the return of Yomitan
Auxiliary Airfield, and the relocation of artillery live-fire
training over Highway 104.
Subsequently, in response to an unfortunate incident
that occurred in 1995, as well as the refusal of the then
Governor of Okinawa Prefecture to sign land lease
renewal documents under the Act on Special Measures
for USFJ Land Release, the Government of Japan
decided to devote even greater initiatives towards
realignment consolidation and reduction believing

As part of the optimization of the USFJ force posture,
the 12th Marine Regiment located at Camp Hansen in
Okinawa will be reorganized into the 12th MLR by 2025.
While the main capability of the 12th Marine Regiment
is artillery firepower as an artillery unit, the reorganized
MLR will have a variety of capabilities, including
anti-ship strike capabilities with anti-ship missiles, air
defense capabilities, logistics support capabilities, and
ISR capabilities.

**(2) Establishment of the Composite Watercraft**
**Company at Yokohama North Dock**

In April 2023, the U.S. Army’s Composite Watercraft
Company was established at Yokohama North Dock
to strengthen the maritime mobility of U.S. Forces
in emergency situations, including disasters. The
established unit will contribute to strengthening the
Japan-U.S. Alliance transportation capabilities in Japan
and improve the mobility of the U.S. Forces in the region.

**2 Stationing of the U.S. Forces in Okinawa**


In comparison to areas such as the U.S. mainland,
Hawaii, and Guam, Okinawa is located closer to
potential conflict areas that could affect Japan’s peace
and security, including the Korean Peninsula and the
Taiwan Strait, but at the same time has the advantage of
having a certain distance from these areas that would not
heighten military tension there unnecessarily. In addition,
Okinawa, comprising a large number of small islands,
is located roughly in the center of the Southwestern
Islands having a total length of some 1,200 km and close
to key sea lanes for Japan, which depends on marine
transportation for over 99% of its overall international
trade. Furthermore, its location is extremely important
from the perspective of security, as Okinawa serves as a
strategically important target for neighboring countries
in both making access to the Pacific from the continent
and rejecting access from the Pacific to the continent.
Thus, the stationing of the U.S. Forces in Okinawa,
including the U S Marine Corps which can deal

In order to hold consultations on issues related to USFJ
facilities and areas in Okinawa, the Government of
Japan established the Okinawa Action Council between
the central government and Okinawa Prefecture, as well
as the Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO)
between Japan and the United States, and the so-called
SACO Final Report was compiled in 1996.

The SACO Final Report stipulates the return of land,
the adjustment of training and operational procedures,
noise reduction, and the improvement of operational
procedures regarding the SOFA procedures, and also
refers to the related facilities and areas covered. The
land to be returned based on the SACO Final Report
represents approximately 21% (about 50 km2) of USFJ


facilities and areas in Okinawa at that time, exceeding
the amount of land returned during the period between
the reversion of Okinawa and the implementation of the
SACO Final Report, which is roughly 43 km[2].

December 2016, and the return of approximately 4,000
ha, a major portion of the Northern Training Area located
in the villages of Kunigami and Higashi, was achieved
based on the SACO Final Report.
The returned land accounts for approximately 20% of
USFJ facilities and areas (for exclusive use) in Okinawa.
The return is the largest one since the reversion of
Okinawa to the mainland, and had been an issue for 20
years since the SACO Final Report in 1996.
Based on the Act on Special Measures Concerning
Promotion of Effective and Appropriate Use of the
Lands in Okinawa Prefecture Previously Provided for
Use by the Stationed Forces, the MOD took measures
to remove obstacles (such as soil contamination survey,
etc.) so that the landowners, etc., could use returned
lands effectively and appropriately, and transferred the
land to the landowners in December 2017. In addition,
in July 2021, the northern part of the main island of


Okinawa, including the returned lands, was inscribed in
the World Natural Heritage Site as part of the AmamiOshima Island, Tokunoshima Island, Northern part of
Okinawa Island, and Iriomote Island.

At the G7 Hiroshima Summit chaired by Prime
Minister Kishida in May 2023, the leaders agreed on the
importance of the rule of law and the principles of the
UN Charter in a session that included the leaders of the
invited countries and President Zelenskyy of Ukraine.
In addition, at the Japan-Ukraine Summit Meeting
held on the occasion of the Hiroshima Summit, Prime
Minister Kishida conveyed Japan’s intention to newly
provide around 100 SDF vehicles such as trucks, and
approximately 30,000 emergency rations to Ukraine,
and the two leaders shared the view to coordinate even
more closely.
At the Presidency Press Conference following the
Hiroshima Summit, Prime Minister Kishida stated
that Japan would continue to lead the discussions in
the G7 from the perspective of upholding the free and
open international order based on the rule of law, and
strengthening Japan’s engagement with its international

mutual trust and work together to solve regional security
issues.
It is also necessary to further coordinate with each
other from peacetime to deter unilateral changes to the
status quo by force and such attempts and to be able to
receive support from like-minded countries in the event
of a contingency.
Defense cooperation and exchanges have been
delivered in the forms of high-level dialogues and
exchanges; bilateral training and exercises; capacity
building, in which human resource development and
technical support are provided to other countries in the
fields of security and defense; and defense equipment
and technology which is conducted in order to promote
Japan’s security, contribution to peace, and international
cooperation.
The MOD/SDF has long strived to alleviate any
feelings of confrontation and tension, and to foster a
collaborative and cooperative atmosphere by building
face-to-face relationships through bilateral dialogues
and exchanges. In addition, the MOD/SDF has recently
enhanced bilateral defense relationships from traditional
exchanges to deeper cooperation in a phased manner
by appropriately combining various means, including
bilateral/multilateral training and exercises, capacity
building, defense equipment and technology cooperation,
and the development of institutional frameworks such as
the ACSA.
Furthermore, multilateral regional security cooperation
and dialogues are in the process of evolution from those
that focus on dialogue to those that focus on cooperation
that seeks to build regional order. It is important to
promote bilateral and multilateral defense cooperation
and exchanges in a multilayered and practical manner in
order to create a desirable security environment

A free and open maritime order, which relies on the rule
of law, is the foundation for the stability and prosperity of
the international community. The Indo-Pacific region is
at the center of the world vitality, and home to more than
half the world population. It is important to establish this

of Japan, such as a rapid military modernization and
intensified military activities.

Fig. III-3-1 MOD’s Approach Under the Vision of a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific”

MOD's Approach under the vision of
a "Free and Open Indo-Pacific"

Background

〇 In August 2016, then Prime Minister Abe unveiled the “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” concept in his keynote address at TICAD VI in Kenya.
〇 Japan’s fundamental aim is to foster regional stability and prosperity by improving connectivity between Asia and Africa through a free and open Indo-Pacific
region.

-  Prime Minister Kishida announced Japan’s new plan for a FOIP in his policy speech at the Indian Council of World Affairs (ICWA) held in India in March 2023.

Basic concepts of “Free and Open Indo-Pacific”

〇 The Indo-Pacific region is the center of the world vitality and home to more than half the world population; realizing the stable and autonomous development in
this region is crucial for the stability and prosperity of the world.

〇 The goal of “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” Vision is to facilitate free and robust economic activity throughout the Indo-Pacific, and to realize the prosperity in the
entire region.

New Pillars of Cooperation for FOIP

(1) Principles for peace and rules for prosperity (2) Addressing challenges in an Indo-Pacific way
(3) Multilayered connectivity (4) Extending efforts for security and safe use of the “sea” to the “air”

**✓✓ Japan is pursuing “Free and Open Indo Pacific” Vision through a coordinated whole-of-government approach.**

Characteristics of the Indo-Pacific Region

〇 The Indo-Pacific region is at the center of global economic dynamism and home to the largest share of the world’s population. Key sea lanes are located in the
Indo-Pacific area; as a result, regional stability is essential to Japan’s security and prosperity.
〇 Meanwhile, there are various challenges within the region, including rapid military modernization and intensified military activities.
〇 All countries in the region are taking measures to respond to these rapid changes in the environment.

Aspects of MOD’s Approach

〇 Securing the stable use of major sea lanes by defense cooperation and exchange activities
〇 Preventing contingencies through confidence-building and mutual understanding
〇 Contributing to peace and stability through active engagement in the region, in cooperation with partner countries

Fig. III-3-1-1 Defense Cooperation and Exchanges

Defense cooperation and exchanges

“Defense cooperation and exchanges” refers to efforts to strengthen bilateral and multilateral defense relations by using various tools, which are significant
initiatives for securing the peace and stability of Japan and the international community.

Purpose of defense cooperation and exchanges

〇 To create a security environment desirable for Japan
〇 To deter threats from reaching Japan by making opponents realize that doing harm to Japan would be difficult and consequential
〇 To prevent contingencies through promoting confidence-building and mutual understanding

Tools for defense cooperation and exchanges

Tool 1: Cooperation and exchanges among people
... On such occasions as “2+2” Meetings, defense ministerial meetings, chief of staff-level meetings or other high-level meetings, working-level
consultations among defense authorities, and multilateral international conferences, participants frankly exchange views on defense policies, regional
situations, defense cooperation and exchanges, etc., thereby developing mutual understanding and confidence-building among them and further promoting
defense cooperation and exchanges thereafter. Exchanges of students and interchange in education and research aim to facilitate understanding of defense
policies and statuses of military units of other countries and promote relations of trust through network building.

Japan-India “2+2”Meeting Japan-US-Australia Senior Indo-Pacific Sea Power Conference hosted Dispatching liaison officers

Leaders Seminar by Royal Australian Navy to Australian Defence Force

Tool 2: Cooperation and exchanges among assets
... Through goodwill exercise, mutual visits of naval ships and aircraft (calling at ports and airports), exchange events among units, and other measures,
mutual trust with partner countries is developed and cooperative relationships are promoted. In joint training and exercises, the SDF will enhance the skills of
each unit and strengthen nation-to-nation defense relationships through by increasing collaborative capacity with foreign military assets.

region that are taking steps to respond to changes in the
environment, the MOD/SDF is trying to contribute to
regional peace and stability by supporting their efforts
through defense cooperation and exchanges.

**(3) Expansion of FOIP**
With the Japan-U.S. Alliance as its cornerstone, Japan’s
policy is to deepen cooperation with like-minded
countries and further promote efforts towards realizing
FOIP through Japan-Australia-India-U.S. (Quad)
initiatives, etc. With respect to Southeast Asia, South
Asia, Pacific Island countries, the Middle East, Africa,
and Latin American countries, cooperation will be
strengthened to realize FOIP while utilizing a wide range
of means. For example, Quad Leaders’ Meeting held on
the occasion of the G7 Hiroshima Summit in May 2023


the leaders reaffirmed their strong commitment to the
common vision of FOIP.
Specifically, the MOD/SDF is working to maintain
the stable use of sea lanes by establishing good relations
with countries in the aforementioned regions and
ensuring that the SDF has stable access to their ports
and airports. The MOD/SDF is also promoting defense
cooperation and exchanges, such as bilateral/multilateral
exercise and capacity building, to enable these countries
to play a more effective role for the stability of the IndoPacific region.
The United States, which is the ally of Japan, Australia,
India, European countries such as the United Kingdom,
France, and Germany, Canada, and New Zealand, are

**Exchanges with ASEAN countries**

ASEAN countries have high potential as growth centers
with continuous high economic growth. In addition,
ASEAN countries are situated in strategically important
areas that occupy key points on Japan’s sea lanes,
and they play an important role in ensuring peace and


-----

prosperity for both Japan and whole of the region.
Given such importance of ASEAN countries, there
is great significance in the MOD/SDF strengthening
defense cooperation and exchanges with each ASEAN
country while supporting efforts to reinforce ASEAN
centrality, unity, and resilience as the foundation for
regional cooperation from the view of realizing FOIP.
This will also lead to the creation of a desirable security
environment for Japan.
Based on this principle, Japan is promoting confidence
building and mutual understanding through highlevel and working-level exchanges as well as capacity
building, bilateral/multilateral training, and defense
equipment and technology cooperation with ASEAN
countries. In addition to bilateral cooperation, Japan also
conducts cooperation within multilateral frameworks
such as the ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting-Plus
(ADMM-Plus) and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).
The Vientiane Vision, which Japan announced in 2016
was the first guideline for Japan-ASEAN defense
cooperation, which presented an overall picture of the
priority area of the future direction of ASEAN-wide
defense cooperation in a transparent manner. In 2019,

Utilization of the Maritime and Aerial Communication
Mechanism began in June 2018. The “Maritime and
Aerial Communication Mechanism between the
Defense Authorities of Japan and China” has been
developed (1) to promote mutual understanding and
confidence between Japan and China and to enhance
bilateral defense cooperation and exchange; (2) to avoid
unexpected collisions; and (3) to prevent unforeseen
circumstances in the sea and air from developing into
military clashes or political or diplomatic issues. The
mechanism’s main components include (1) annual and
expert meetings between the two countries’ defense
authorities; (2) a hotline between Japanese and Chinese
defense authorities; and (3) on scene communication
measures between vessels and aircraft of the SDF and
the People’s Liberation Army.

**16 Russia**

Russia’s aggression against Ukraine that began in
February 2022 clearly undermines the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Ukraine, is a serious violation of
international law and the Charter of the United Nations,
which forbid the use of force, and is an absolutely
unacceptable act. Such unilateral changes to the status
quo by force shake the foundations of the international
order, and on this basis, the Government of Japan
condemns Russia to the utmost degree.
The Government of Japan handles the relationship

with Russia appropriately while emphasizing the
solidarity of the G7 and taking the Ukrainian situation
into account. At the same time, it is also necessary to
maintain the minimum essential contacts with Russia,


as it is one of Japan s neighbors, in order to avoid
unforeseen circumstances or unnecessary conflicts.

utilize the ADI to promote closer communication with
ASEAN, and contribute more actively to peace and
stability in the region with all parties.


**1 Multilateral Security Framework and**
**Dialogue Initiatives**

Multilateral framework initiatives, especially the ASEAN
Defence Ministers’ Meeting Plus (ADMM-Plus) and the
ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF),[6] have made steady
progress and served as an important foundation for
dialogue and cooperation and exchanges on the security
of the Indo-Pacific region. Japan places importance on
such multilateral frameworks and is contributing to the
strengthening of cooperation and mutual confidence
with countries in the region.

ASEAN holds the ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting
(ADMM), a ministerial level meeting among defense
authorities in the ASEAN region, and the ADMM-Plus,
which includes eight other countries outside of ASEAN,[7]
including Japan (so-called “Plus Countries”).
The ADMM-Plus is an invaluable framework that
brings together defense ministers from all ASEAN
member states and Plus Countries to discuss security
issues and defense cooperation and exchanges in the
region and the international community. The MOD/SDF
has been actively participating in this framework.
In November 2022, Parliamentary Vice-Minister of
Defense Onoda attended the 9th ADMM-Plus held in
Cambodia and expressed Japan’s determination to make
utmost efforts to uphold a rules-based, free and open


The ARF, a forum aimed at improving the security environment in the Asia-Pacific region through dialogue and cooperation on political and security issues, has been held since 1994. The ARF
currently comprises 25 countries, one area, and one organization as members and holds various inter-governmental meetings that are attended by both foreign affairs and defense officials to
exchange opinions on the regional situation and the security area. The 25 countries and one area are the 10 ASEAN member states (Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia (since 1995) and Myanmar (since 1996)), Japan, Australia, Canada, China and India (since 1996), New Zealand, PNG, the ROK, Russia, the United States and Mongolia

Japan serves as the co-chair of the EWG on PKO with Vietnam in the fourth cycle of EWGs, which is from 2021 to 2024.


**(3) ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)**
Regarding the ARF, in which mainly diplomatic
authorities are engaged, concrete efforts[9] have been made
in recent years for specific initiatives in non-traditional


security areas such as disaster relief, maritime security,
and peacekeeping and peace building. The MOD/SDF
has been making active contributions to this forum.


In addition to the Ministers’ meeting at the foreign minister level, the Senior Officials’ Meeting (SOM) and Inter-Sessional Meetings (ISM) are held each year, as well as meetings of the Inter-Sessional
Support Group on Confidence Building Measures and Preventive Diplomacy (ISG on CBM/PD) and the ARF Security Policy Conference (ASPC). Moreover, since the Ministers’ meeting in 2002, the

common challenge. During the seminar, Japan explained
the Ministry of Defense Response Strategy on Climate
Change, which was formulated in August 2022. The
participating countries also exchanged views on the
impact associated with climate change such as natural
disasters and efforts being taken by their respective
militaries.
In the field of cybersecurity, the Japan-ASEAN Cyber
Security Training Program for Defense Authorities[10] was
implemented for the first time in February 2022.
In the field of HA/DR, Japan has conducted the
Japan-ASEAN Invitation Program on HA/DR. In
February 2023, the 5th round of this program was
held. Invited disaster response officials from ASEAN
member states’ militaries and the ASEAN Secretariat,
participated in seminars, a tabletop exercise and visited
disaster prevention drill facilities in order to strengthen
multinational coordination in the event of large-scale
natural disasters.
In February of the same year, the 3rd Professional
Airmanship Program (PAP) was conducted in Japan,
inviting air force officers and officials from ASEAN
countries. These initiatives have further promoted
mutual understanding and confidence building between
the MOD/SDF and participants from ASEAN, and
sharing of professional and practical knowledge in the
field of HA/DR.
In the field of maritime security, in March of the same
year, the 4th Japan-ASEAN Ship Rider Cooperation
Program was conducted, inviting naval officers
and officials from ASEAN countries. Seminars on
international law and various training programs were
held.
In sum, Japan contributes to the stability of the
Indo-Pacific region by supporting participants from
ASEAN countries to improve capacity, foster mutual
understanding and build networks through such efforts
as sharing of international law recognition and various
seminars and training programs on maritime security
and HA/DR.

a. ASEAN-Japan Defence Ministers’ Informal Meeting
and Vientiane Vision 2.0
In June 2022, then Defense Minister Kishi visited
Cambodia to attend the 7th ASEAN-Japan Defence
Ministers’ Informal Meeting and held bilateral meetings
with the participating countries.
At the meeting, then Defense Minister Kishi stated
that Japan would strongly promote various initiatives
under the Vientiane Vision 2.0. He also announced
initiatives to tackle new security issues, including
holding a seminar in the field of environment to share
knowledge and exchange views gained by the Climate
Change Taskforce. The ASEAN ministers welcomed
Japan’s initiatives and expressed their expectations for
the further promotion of practical defense cooperation.
The Vientiane Vision 2.0 presents an overall picture of
the priority areas of the future direction of ASEAN-wide
defense cooperation in a transparent manner. It retains
the basic framework of the initial Vision, including
its objectives, direction, and means of cooperation,
but introduces three new pillars: firstly, establishing
three principles of Japan-ASEAN cooperation which
are “heart-to-heart cooperation,” “tailored and lasting
cooperation,” and “equal and open cooperation;”
secondly, introducing the concept of “resilience” to
clarify the connection between our efforts and ASEAN’s
centrality and unity; and thirdly, pursuing synergies
between the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP)
and Japan’s Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP).
In the field of environmental security, recognizing that
climate change is a security threat, the Japan-ASEAN
Seminar on Climate Change and Security was held for


-----

time in about four years. Japan explained its new
NSS formulated in December 2022 and expressed the
commitment to maintain and reinforce the free and open
international order and to strengthen cooperation with
like-minded countries and others, in order to realize
FOIP.

**(5) Others**
a. International Conferences Hosted by Private
Organizations
International conferences on security include not only
intergovernmental conferences but also meetings
organized by private organizations in which various
people, such as government officials, scholars, and
journalists, participate to discuss medium- to long- term
security issues.
Major international conferences organized by private
bodies include the IISS Asia Security Summit (ShangriLa Dialogue)[11] and IISS Regional Security Summit
(Manama Dialogue) [12] organized by the International
Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), and the Munich
Security Conference,[13] one of the most prestigious
meetings on security in Europe and the United States.
By actively participating in these conferences, Japan’s
Defense Minister and MOD officials build trust and
share understanding with high-level officials of various
countries and send out positive messages through
meetings with defense ministers and representatives
from other countries and delivering speeches at plenary
sessions.
In June 2022, then Defense Minister Kishi attended
and gave a speech at the 19th Shangri-La Dialogue. In
his speech, he first pointed out that the lessons drawn
from Russia’s aggression against Ukraine can be applied
to the Indo-Pacific region, which has latent issues
synonymous with the invasion. He asserted that Japan
is located right at the frontline facing to actors who
provoke such problems and emphasized the need to
fundamentally reinforce Japan’s defense capabilities and
further elevate the Japan-U.S. Alliance, in order to even
more closely follow the path of a peace-loving nation.


In addition, then Defense Minister Kishi mentioned
building truly mutually beneficial partnerships that
support the centrality and unity of ASEAN, reinforcing
the international-law-based-rules through various
regional frameworks, developing the Japan, the United
States, Australia and India cooperation framework into
a more tangible initiative, and promoting cooperation
with countries outside of the region, beginning with
European countries. He also stated that he was confident
that even if a crisis hits the Indo-Pacific, the international
community can act as one to rebuff such an attempt to
disregard the rules, and delivered a strong message that
no one should underestimate the strong solidarity of the
countries protecting the rules-based international order.

international organizations, and non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) in those countries. In 2022, Japan
conducted exchanges with the militaries of participating
countries through medical treatment on U.S. Navy
hospital ships and HA/DR seminars in Vietnam, the
Republic of Palau, and the Solomon Islands, and
strengthened cooperation with participating countries,
organizations, and others.

**(2) Multilateral Exercises**
The multilateral relationships have recently shifted
from the phase for confidence-building to the phase
for developing more concrete and practical cooperative
relationships. Various multilateral training and exercises
have been actively conducted as important initiatives to


effectively help this shift.
In particular, in the Indo-Pacific region, the MOD/
SDF has actively participated in multilateral training
and exercises in non-traditional security fields, such
as HA/DR and Non-combatant Evacuation Operations
(NEO), in addition to traditional training conducted
in preparation for combat situations. It is important
to participate in such multilateral exercises so as not
only to the skill level of the SDF, but also to create a
cooperative platform with relevant countries. In light of
this perspective, the MOD/SDF intends to continue to
actively engage in such training.

See Reference 58 (Participation in Multilateral Exercises (FY2019

and Beyond))



**Cooperation in Use of Space and Cyber Domains**
**4**


In the international community, there is a broadening
and diversifying array of security challenges that
cannot be dealt with by a single country alone. Rapid
expansion in the use of the space and cyber domains is
poised to fundamentally change the existing paradigm
of national security, which makes the establishment of
international rules and norms a security agenda. The
MOD/SDF will swiftly achieve superiority in space


and cyber domains by strengthening coordination and
cooperation with relevant countries through information
sharing, consultation, exercise, and capacity building,
while promoting measures concerning the development
of international norms.

and technical guidance. With the invitation method,
the partner country’s officials are invited to the MOD/
SDF’s units and organizations to improve their capacity
and to share knowledge of current human resources
development efforts by the MOD/SDF through seminars,
lectures, practical exercises, and training programs.
In addition, online lectures and practical training have
been introduced as a new means of capacity building
from 2021, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In FY2022, a total of 34 dispatch, invitational, and
online programs were conducted for 13 countries and
one organization.
Specifically, some of the dispatch programs conducted
by the MOD/SDF provided knowledge sharing and
practical skill-building support in the fields of air rescue,
underwater unexploded ordnance (UXO) disposal, and
underwater medicine for Viet Nam; ship maintenance
for the Philippines; PKO (engineering) for Cambodia;
HA/DR (military medicine) and PKO (engineering) for
Mongolia; military band training for Papua New Guinea;
engineering and vehicle maintenance for Timor-Leste;
and HA/DR (engineering and search and rescue/military
medicine) for Laos PDR.
The implemented invitational programs included
knowledge sharing and practical skill-building support
in the fields of air rescue, underwater unexploded
ordnance disposal, and cybersecurity for Viet Nam;
ship maintenance, flight medicine, and HA/DR for the
Philippines; military medicine for Fiji; HA/DR ( military
medicine) for Mongolia; HA/DR (engineering equipment
maintenance) for Papua New Guinea; military medicine
for Kazakhstan; HA/DR (engineering and search and
rescue/military medicine) for Laos PDR; HA/DR for
Malaysia; HA/DR and Japanese language education
support for Indonesia, and HA/DR for ASEAN countries
and the ASEAN Secretariat.
The online programs included a seminar on the field
of air rescue for the Sri Lanka Air Force.
Furthermore, in Africa, the MOD/SDF has been
supporting the Djibouti Armed Forces with its capacity
building program for strengthening disaster response
capacity, including training on the operation of
engineering equipment. From December 2022 to January
2023 14 SDF personnel were dispatched to train 16


**1 Significance of Capacity Building**


Capacity building is an initiative to actively create regional
stability and enhance the global security environment by
improving recipient countries’ own capacities through
continuous human resource development and technical
support on a steady-state basis in fields related to security
and defense.
By implementing these programs with other countries,
in particular those in the Indo-Pacific region, the MOD/
SDF is creating a desirable security environment for
Japan by helping the partner countries’ forces, etc., to
adequately fulfill roles in maintaining international
peace and regional stability.
Such activities have the effects of (1) strengthening
bilateral relationships with partner countries, (2)
strengthening relationships with countries such as
the United States and Australia by providing capacity
building through cooperation with them, and (3)
enhancing trust in the MOD/SDF and Japan as a whole
by raising awareness at home and abroad of Japan’s
proactive and independent efforts to realize regional
peace and stability.
The MOD/SDF will implement capacity building
programs effectively by fully cooperating with
diplomatic policies and combining various means to
maximize these effects, while also tapping into the
knowledge accumulated by the SDF to date.

**2 Specific Activities**


**Part**

**Chapter**


The MOD/SDF have provided capacity building in
such areas as HA/DR, PKO, and maritime security to
16 countries and one organization mainly in the IndoPacific region.
The MOD/SDF’s capacity building programs are
aimed at improving the capabilities of partner countries
in a concrete and steady manner over a certain period
of time. Some programs are carried out by dispatching
MOD/SDF officials to the partner country, by inviting
the partner country’s officials to Japan, or a combination
of both.
With the dispatch method, SDF officials with technical
knowledge are dispatched to the partner country to help
said country’s forces and their related organizations

for coping with piracy. However, in cases where it is
deemed extremely difficult or impossible for the JCG to
cope with piracy by itself, the SDF is to take action as
well.
For Japan and the international community, off the
coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden are extremely
important sea lanes, connecting Europe and the Middle
East with East Asia. Successive UN Security Council
resolutions have been adopted since the resolution
adopted in June 2008 in response to the frequent
occurrence of and rapid increase in piracy incidents with
the purpose of acquiring ransoms by detaining hostages
caused by pirates, who are armed with machine guns and
rocket launchers. These resolutions have requested that
various countries take actions, particularly the dispatch
of warships and military aircraft, to deter piracy off the
coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden.
To date, approximately 30 countries, including the
United States, have dispatched their warships off the
coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden. As part of
counter-piracy initiatives, the Combined Task Force 151
(CTF-151) was established in 2009, and is continuing its
activities.
The number of piracy incidents off the coast of
Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden currently continues to
be low due to such successful efforts by the international
community. However, the root causes of piracy, such as
Somalia’s unstable internal security and poverty, have
not yet been solved. In addition, considering the fact

**2 Japanese Initiatives**

**(1) Legislation Concerning Counter-Piracy Operations**
In 2009, following the order for Maritime Security
Operations for the purpose of protecting Japan-related
vessels from acts of piracy off the coast of Somalia and in
the Gulf of Aden, two destroyers[1] began providing direct
escort to Japan-related vessels, while P-3C patrol aircraft
also commenced warning and surveillance operations in
the same year.
Japan subsequently enacted the Anti-Piracy Measures
Act [2] in the same year. This legislation made it possible
to protect the vessels of all nations from the acts of
piracy. Moreover, it also enabled the use of weapons to
a reasonable extent, if no other means were available, in
order to halt boats engaging in the acts of piracy, such as
approaching private vessels.

**(2) Activities by the SDF**
a. Dispatch of the Deployment Surface Force for Counter
Piracy Enforcement (DSPE) and Other Units
The SDF dispatches the DSPE, the Deployment Air Force for
Counter Piracy Enforcement (DAPE), and the Deployment
Support Group for Counter Piracy Enforcement (DGPE) to
carry out counter-piracy operations.
The DSPE strives to ensure the safety of ships
navigating in the area by using a destroyer in two different
manners - direct escort of private vessels across the Gulf
of Aden, and zone defense in allocated areas in the Gulf
of Aden. There are JCG officers aboard the destroyer.[3]

The DAPE conducts counter-piracy activities using
two P-3C patrol aircraft. The unit conducts warning and
surveillance operations in the flight zone that is determined
in coordination with the CTF-151 Headquarters and
confirms any suspicious boats. At the same time, the unit
also provides information to the MSDF destroyer, the
naval vessels of other countries and civilian vessels, and
immediately confirms the safety of the surrounding area,


if requested. The information gathered by MSDF P-3Cs
is constantly shared with other related organizations, and
contributes significantly to deterring acts of piracy and
disarming vessels suspected as pirate ships.
In order to improve the operational efficiency and
effectiveness of the DAPE, the DGPE carries out
activities such as maintenance of the installation set up
in the northwest district of Djibouti International Airport.
Additionally, the Airlift Squadron operates ASDF
transport aircraft to carry out air transport of materials
required by the DAPE and the DGPE, and airlifts, etc.,
are organized as needed.
b. Dispatch of Personnel to the CTF-151 Headquarters, Etc.
In order to strengthen coordination with the units of other
countries engaged in counter-piracy operations and enhance
the effectiveness of the SDF’s counter-piracy operations, the
MOD has dispatched SDF personnel to the CTF-151 and
CMF headquarters since August 2014. Of these, the SDF
dispatched a CTF-151 commander for the first time in 2015,
followed by respective dispatches in 2017, 2018, and 2020.


-----

c. Achievements
As of March 31, 2023, the DSPE has escorted 4,068
vessels (including 121 vessels escorted based on orders
for maritime security operations). Under the protection
of the SDF destroyers, not a single vessel has come to
any harm from pirates and these vessels have all passed
safely across the Gulf of Aden.
As of March 31, 2023, the DAPE has conducted
the following activities: aircraft have flown 3,089
missions with their flying hours totaling 22,190 hours;
and information was provided to vessels navigating
the area and other countries engaging in counter-piracy
operations on 15,972 occasions. The activities conducted
by the DAPE account for approximately 90% of the
warning and surveillance operations carried out in the
Gulf of Aden by the international community.

I, Chapter 4, Section 5-2 (2) (Piracy)


**3 Praise for Japan’s Endeavors**

The counter-piracy operations by the SDF have been
highly praised by the international community. For
example, national leaders and others have expressed
their gratitude and the SDF has also been repeatedly
well-received by the UN Security Council Resolution.
Moreover, the MSDF destroyers, which are engaging
in counter-piracy operations off the coast of Somalia
and in the Gulf of Aden, has received many messages
from the captains and ship owners of the vessels that its
units have escorted, expressing their gratitude that the
ships were able to cross the Gulf of Aden with peace of
mind and asking them to continue escorting ships there.
Additionally, the Japanese Shipowners’ Association
and other groups expressed appreciation for protection
of Japan-related vessels and asked for continuation of
efforts in fighting against piracy.

In the Indo-Pacific Deployment (IPD22), the deployed
units conducted multilateral training with the navies of
various countries in the Indo-Pacific region, and also
made port calls at ports in Indo-Pacific region coastal
countries.
In addition, the DSPE and DAPE are conducting
bilateral/multilateral training with the EU and other
organizations[4] off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf
of Aden with the aim of improving their tactical skills


and strengthening cooperation with the armed forces of
each country.
Strengthening cooperation with coastal states of the
Indo-Pacific region through the bilateral/multilateral
exercise and port calls contributes to maintaining
maritime security, which has extremely high significance.

**Initiatives to Support UN PKO and other activities**
**2**


As a means to promote peace and stability in conflict
regions around the world, UN PKO have expanded their
missions in recent years to include such duties as the
Protection of Civilians (POC), the promotion of political
processes, providing assistance in Disarmament,
Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) into society
of former soldiers, Security Sector Reform (SSR), the
rule of law, elections, human rights, and other fields,
in addition to such traditional missions as ceasefire
monitoring. As of the end of March 2023, there are 12
UN PKO missions ongoing.
International organizations, such as the Office of
the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),
respective governments, and NGOs conduct relief and
restoration activities for the victims of conflicts and
large-scale disasters from a humanitarian perspective
and from the viewpoint of stabilizing affected countries.
Japan has been promoting international peace
cooperation assignments in various regions, including
Cambodia, the Golan Heights, Timor-Leste, Nepal, and
South Sudan for more than 25 years, and these activities
have been highly praised both inside and outside of Japan.
Currently Japan dispatches staff officers to the United


Nations Mission in the Republic of South Sudan (UNMISS)
and the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO).
Japan will actively contribute to international
peace cooperation activities through such activities
as dispatch of personnel to mission headquarters and
capacity building in Japan’s fields of expertise by using
accumulated experience so far and working on human
resource development.

**5 Support to the UNTPP**

Japan has so far earned unquestionable trust in the areas of
engineering and transport that are essential for promoting
smooth peacekeeping operations. To continue to support
the rapid deployment of peacekeeping missions and
implement high quality activities, Japan expressed its
active support at the PKO Summit in September 2014,
and it was embodied by the UNTPP.
The UNTPP was founded using funds from Japan as
a project to support training for military engineers and
the procurement of heavy equipment by the UN DOS.
From the start of the program to March 2023, a total of
184 GSDF personnel have been dispatched to Africa to
provide 10 training sessions for a total of 312 members
from eight African countries.
Considering that 30% or more of PKO personnel are
from Asia, Japan decided to implement the program
for the first time in Asia and the surrounding area. The
program provides training on heavy engineering piloting
for engineering personnel. From August 2022, 26 GSDF
personnel were dispatched to the Indonesia Peace
and Security Centre to contribute to the acquisition
of knowledge and skills necessary for infrastructure
development and building camps in PKO for Indonesian
military engineers. From the start of the program
until March 2023, a total of 92 GSDF personnel were
dispatched to provide a total of four training sessions
for 76 personnel from nine countries in Asia and the
surrounding area.
In addition, the UN decided to extend the scope of
support under this program to the field of sanitation,
given that strengthening sanitation capacity to ensure
the safety of deployed personnel has become an issue in
UN peacekeeping operations. In response, the UN Field
Medical Assistant Course (UNFMAC), which aims to
train personnel who can provide first aid before medics
or medical personnel provide specialized treatment
in areas of PKO operations, was established. In June
2022, the second UNFMAC pilot was held at the UN
Regional Service Centre Entebbe in Uganda, and one
GSDF officer was dispatched as an instructor to provide
education to 21 personnel.
Furthermore, as part of the UNTPP, Japan is hosting
an online Construction Process Management Course for


The MOD/SDF dispatches personnel to the UN
Secretariat for the purpose of actively contributing to
the UN efforts to achieve international peace and for the
purpose of utilizing their experiences in Japan’s PKO
activity. As of March 2023, two of the SDF personnel
(chief level and action officer level) are involved in the
military planning for UN peacekeeping mission and
competency assessment of each personnel member
of various countries at the UN Department of Peace
Operations (DPO), and one SDF personnel and one
administrative official (both action officer level) are
working on the United Nations Triangular Partnership
Programme (UNTPP)[2] at the UN Department of

**International Disaster Relief Activities**
**3**


In recent years, the role of military affairs has become
more diverse, and opportunities for military to use their
capabilities in HA/DR are growing. To contribute to the
advancement of international cooperation, the SDF has
also engaged in international disaster relief activities
proactively from the viewpoint of humanitarian
contributions and improvement of the global security
environment.
To this end, the SDF maintains its readiness to take
any necessary actions based on prepared disaster relief
operation plans. In consultation with the Minister
for Foreign Affairs, the SDF has been proactively
conducting international disaster relief activities,
which fully utilize its functions and capabilities, while
taking into consideration specific relief requests by the
governments of affected countries and disaster situations
in these countries.

engaged in international disaster relief activities upon
to requests from the governments of affected countries
or the international organizations. In 1992, the Japan
Disaster Relief Team Law was partially amended to allow
the SDF to participate in international disaster relief
activities and to transport its personnel and equipment
for this purpose.

Furthermore, Japan has actively cooperated in the
initiatives of the international community that focus on
the prohibition of anti-personnel mines by submitting
annual reports that include data on Japan’s exceptional
stocks to the Secretariat of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban
Convention (Ottawa Treaty[2]).
Japan also submits an annual Confidence-Building
Measures report in relation to the Biological Weapons
Convention (BWC).
In addition, the MOD/SDF provides an annual report
under the frameworks of the UN Register of Conventional
Arms, the UN Report on Military Expenditures, and
the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT[3]), which aim to increase
the transparency of military preparedness and military
expenditure. The MOD/SDF also dispatches personnel
as needed to governmental expert meetings and other
meetings for reviewing and improving these systems.

In addition, as the realignment of the Western defense
industries and international joint development are
making progress, Japan formulated the Three Principles
on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology in


April 2014. However, improvement of international
competitiveness has become a challenge for Japan’s
defense industry, because the industry has developed
based on the production of defense equipment only for
the SDF.

with other countries (see Section 3).


**1 Past Initiatives**

Based on the “Strategy on Defense Production and
Technological Bases” formulated in June 2014, the
MOD has implemented various measures that contribute
to the maintenance and reinforcement of the defense
production and technology bases, such as improving the
contract system, including the enactment of the Longterm Contract Act, and the establishment of ATLA,
which integrated the organizations involved in defense
equipment procurement.
In addition, the following new measures have also
been adopted by ATLA: (1) reinforcement of the defense
technology base to maintain technological superiority
in the future and achieve advanced capabilities ahead
of other countries (see Section 2); (2) formulation of

based on the budget and nature of the business. A new
profit margin calculation method that properly evaluates
the defense industry’s cost management and quality
control efforts has also been introduced.
Additionally, in equipment procurement, it is
imperative to place greater emphasis on maintaining
and reinforcing its domestic infrastructure and strive
for technological, qualitative, and production-time
improvements while ensuring predictability for
companies. Therefore, it will continue to improve
contracting methods by actively adopting proposalbased bidding and reviewing general competitive
bidding in which only a single bid has been received
over multiple years.
Furthermore, in order to revitalize the defense industry
through promoting the entry of new suppliers, it is holding
matching events for the defense industry as part of its
efforts to promote the entry of new participants from small
and medium enterprises, including startup companies.
(b) Responding to Various Risks
(i) Building resilient supply chains
In addition to conducting supply chain surveys based
on the Bill and introducing fiscal measures and financial
support aimed at mitigating the risks identified, Japan
also aims to promote cooperation with other countries to
build mutually complementary supply chains.
The “Security of Supply Arrangement between the
Department of Defense of the United States of America
and the Ministry of Defense of Japan” was signed at the
Japan-U.S. Defense Ministerial Meeting in January 2023.
This Arrangement is a framework that seeks to ensure
a stable mutual supply of industry resources (supplies
and services, etc.) among the signatory countries
and contribute to the establishment of a resilient and
diversified supply chain for defense equipment.
(ii) Strengthening industrial security
For Japan’s defense industry to participate in international
businesses, it is necessary to respond to increasing
threats of cyber attacks. With the aim of strengthening
information security measures, the MOD has developed
the Standards on Cybersecurity Measures for Defense

**Chapter**


**(1) “Bill on Enhancing Defense Production and**
**Technology bases”**

The “Bill on Enhancing Defense Production and
Technology bases” was submitted at the 211th Diet session
to fundamentally reinforce Japan’s defense production
and technology bases based on the current state of its
defense industry (see Paragraph 1 of this Section). The
Bill provides for (1) effective identification of risks by
requiring companies to make efforts to respond to supply
chain surveys;[2] (2) fiscal measures and financial support
for the efforts of companies to strengthen supply chains,
enhance the efficiency of the manufacturing process,
strengthen cybersecurity, ensure business succession,
etc.; (3) support for changing the specifications
and performance of defense equipment to facilitate
equipment transfer; (4) outsourcing of the management
and operation of manufacturing facilities, etc., owned by
the Government to equipment manufacturers, etc., in the
absence of other means even after adopting the measures
described in (2) and (3); and (5) measures to protect the
confidentiality of equipment contracts, etc.

**(2) Other Efforts Besides the Bill**
Besides the above Bill, a wide range of other efforts
will be undertaken to fundamentally reinforce Japan’s
defense production base.
(a) Building a Strong and Sustainable Defense Industry
In the interest of making the defense business more
attractive, Japan will establish a robust policy for
implementing measures aimed at eliminating factors that
put pressure on corporate profits, including building a
framework for applying the appropriate expense ratios

Industry, new information security standards applicable
to contractors handling the MOD’s “information to be
protected”[3] that includes control measures on par with the
standards that U.S. Department of Defense contractors
are obligated to meet. The standards came into effect in
April 2023. In order to steadily implement the standards
across the defense industry, measures will be taken to
cover the cost of cybersecurity measures adopted by
the defense industry and to develop a defense security
gateway (cloud-based).
In addition, the “Defense Industrial Security Manual”
will be created to consolidate the rules and regulations
pertaining to defense industrial security in a centralized
manner so as to further the industries to participate in
defense procurement and to enhance the credibility of
Japan’s information security to facilitate international
transactions.
(iii) Strengthening the management of sensitive
technologies and intellectual property
The MOD is working to prevent technology leakage
through means such as conducting prompt and proper
assessments of technological sensitivity based on the
importance and superiority of the technologies for which
the MOD is responsible. In order to prevent leakages of
sensitive technologies, the MOD, in cooperation with
related ministries and agencies, is promoting studies on
countermeasures against reverse engineering,[4] such as
the blackboxing of technologies.
Through the application of more appropriate contract
provisions regarding intellectual property, the MOD
will accurately grasp intellectual property generated
through R&D, etc., to promote the clarification of public
or private belongings and prevention of leakages of key
technologies to abroad. The ministry will also present
options regarding the opening or closing of intellectual
properties based on the characteristics of the technology
and promotes appropriate management for each option.
In addition, the MOD will work with the Cabinet
Secretariat, the Cabinet Office, and other related ministries
and agencies to prevent leakages of technologies
under the system of non-disclosure of selected patent
applications, one of the economic security measures
adopted by the Government.

(c) Expanding Sales Channels for the Defense Industry
(i) Promoting transfer of defense equipment and
technology
Leveraging the transfer of defense equipment and
technology as a strategic tool for foreign and defense
policy will contribute to strengthening the resiliency of
the defense industry.
From this perspective, the Three Principles on
Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology, its
Implementation Guidelines, and other systems will be
considered for revisions in order to promote smooth
transfer of defense equipment and technology of high
security significance and international joint development
in a broad array of fields. In addition, the Government
will take the lead in promoting the appropriate overseas
transfer of defense equipment and technology under
further cooperation between the public and private
sectors by establishing a fund and allocating the necessary
grants to adjust the specifications and performance for
equipment and technology transfer to ensure suitability
from the perspective of national security.
(ii) Further participation of Japan’s defense industry in

to reinforce the defense production and technology bases,
the MOD has conducted exchanges of views with the
defense industry (major prime contractors) since February
2022 and brought together the Minister of Defense with
the presidents of major prime contractors on two different
occasions since April 2022. In addition, the MOD has
continued to strengthen public-private cooperation and
coordination through sharing problems and challenges
that both sides have identified by holding a total of four
exchanges of views between the Commissioner of ATLA
and the heads of the defense divisions of various companies
as well as a total of five working-level exchanges between

**Direction for Reinforcing Defense Technology Base**
**2**


In the past, defense equipment, etc., has been typically
created through research and development projects
launched by the MOD itself, but with the rapid progress
of cutting-edge science and technology, it has been
difficult to distinguish between defense and civilian
technologies. As such rapid progress in science and
technology fundamentally alters the paradigm of
security, it is important to bring together the advanced
technological capabilities of Japan’s public and private
sectors and utilize them broadly and actively in the
area of national security without being held back by
conventional approaches. Therefore, Japan will further
reinforce its defense technology base by also focusing
on research and development conducted outside the
MOD and taking steps to identify, nurture, and leverage
promising cutting-edge technologies for the early
development of equipment, etc.

-  Identification of promising technologies
In order to identify cutting-edge technologies, the MOD
is engaged in efforts to collect and analyze information
on technologies on a routine basis and, through the
Innovative Science & Technology Initiative for Security
(see 4-2), widely seek research projects from universities,


research institutes, and startup companies to discover
innovative and emergent technologies with the potential
to be utilized for future defense applications. In addition,
since cooperation with startup companies and research
institutes in Japan is essential for identifying cuttingedge civilian technologies and actively leveraging the
results in the area of national security, we will encourage
the broad participation of leading researchers, including
those from academia while obtaining the necessary
understanding and cooperation from the relevant parties.
Through the Advanced Technology Bridging
Research (see 4-2), the MOD is promoting efforts aimed
at identifying and nurturing promising cutting-edge
technologies at an early stage and applying them to the
research and development of equipment, etc., by raising
the level of technological maturity.

-  Measures aimed at early deployment
In order to expedite the research and development of
equipment and achieve early deployment, the MOD is
engaged in “Efforts to Facilitate the Early Practical Use
of Game-Changers” (see 4-2) as an initiative to improve
cutting-edge technologies to the point where they can be
used in the research and development of equipment.

technologies, particularly cutting-edge technologies,
have the potential to be utilized across a variety of fields.
For these reasons, based on the concept of “dual use” in the
sense of civilian technology that can be used for defense
purposes, it can be said that it is gradually becoming
more difficult to divide technologies into defense use or
civilian use and segment civilian technologies that can
also be used for defense applications under the concept
of “dual use,”[1] which has been the conventional line of
thought. The world is moving into an era in which all


**1 Strengthening the Research and**
**Development System**

In recent years, civilian technologies have made
remarkable progress, and it is thought that these advanced
technologies could alter the future of warfare. The U.S.,
China and other countries are competing with one another
to invest heavily in nurturing civilian technologies, which
will likely result in not only economic competitiveness
but also advantages in terms of security. In addition,


-----

advanced civilian technologies can be used for security
purposes, including defense, and should be regarded as
such. By focusing on the technologies that our nation
possesses across a wide range of fields and by advancing
and utilizing these technologies, Japan will be able to
create superior defense equipment.
In order to fundamentally reinforce its capabilities
to incorporate cutting-edge civilian technologies and
produce innovative equipment that will revolutionize
future ways of warfare, Japan will establish a new
research institute in ATLA in FY2024 or after and
expand the infrastructure for studying and promoting the
utilization of cutting-edge technologies in an integrated
manner that takes into account policy, operational, and
technical aspects.
In order to establish a technology think tank function
in ATLA, an activity unit comprising the Agency’s
researchers (technical officers in research positions) and
front-line private-sector researchers (special research
officers) with expertise in cutting-edge technologies
was established in April 2021. The main mission of
this function is to study and analyze technologies that
will be important for the future defense of Japan and to
devise new ways of warfare and game-changers. This
function serves to promote new initiatives based on
collaboration between the public and private sectors,
in which technical officers in research positions match
future ways of warfare to the technologies required to
achieve them, and special research officers study and
provide advice on these technologies.

vehicles (UUV) with convertible mission modules,
stand-off electronic warfare aircraft, and other equipment
through the use of initiatives such as a block approach,
in which the research and development of equipment is
conducted step by step, and modularization. In addition,
the MOD is working to improve efficiency in testing
and evaluation for research and development into future
submarines by utilizing test-bed submarines that are
type-modified versions of existing submarines. New
technologies such as AI and lasers are the subject of
demonstrations by ATLA to enable users to imagine how
these technologies will be used, while a concrete image
of future equipment is being developed by collecting
information on their technical feasibility from private
companies and other parties at an early stage and fully
analyzing the information.
In addition, the introduction of the so-called “agile”
method, a new research and development method in
which prototypes are quickly deployed to units with
improvements to achieve a higher degree of completion
being made as operational feedback is received, will
dramatically shorten research and development periods.

For the defense of Japan, it is vital that Japan continues
to employ superior, state-of-the-art fighters which can
ensure air superiority well into the future. In that sense, as
the F-2 fighter is scheduled to begin its retirement around
2035, it is imperative that the next-generation fighter
aircraft be developed in a Japan-led manner; ensuring
freedom of modification for timely and appropriate
upgrades in the future and securing domestic production
and technology bases for high readiness. It is also a

Next generation fighter aircraft (image)


As technological progress is about to fundamentally
alter the paradigm of security, major states have
endeavored to develop weapons that leverage cuttingedge technologies. The MOD is also working to
greatly shorten research and development periods by
focusing research on promising technological fields and
streamlining the research and development process in

**4 Utilization of Cutting-Edge Technologies**

In order to secure technological superiority in the
future and realize advanced capabilities ahead of other
countries, it is imperative for Japan to conduct research
and development that incorporates a wide range of
advanced civilian technologies and invest heavily in
technologies that can be directly linked to defense
applications, aiming to acquire technologies at an early
stage.
For example, Japan has embarked on research and
development of cutting-edge technologies with the
potential to become game-changers, including combat
support UAVs that harness AI, high power microwave
(HPM) irradiation technology capable of countering
multiple drones, high-energy lasers and railguns capable
of responding to airborne threats more swiftly and at a
lower cost, as well as equipment that takes advantage
of unmanned and labor-saving operations, such as
unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV), unmanned
ground vehicles (UGV), unmanned surface vehicles
(USV), etc.

Europe. In December of the same year, the United States
also announced that it supports Japan’s security and
defense cooperation with likeminded allies and partners,
including with the United Kingdom and Italy on the
trilateral joint development. Japan and the United States
have also agreed to launch a concrete collaboration by
the end of 2023 on autonomous systems such as UAVs
that could complement Japan’s next fighter program

established to promote the strategy in order to further
enhance collaboration with relevant ministries and agencies,
national research and development agencies, industry,
universities, and other parties.

See Fig. IV-1-2-2 (Major Technological Cooperation with National

Research and Development Agencies, etc.)

In addition, it is an effective initiative within the
Government to promote communications between the
relevant ministries and agencies that promote civilianbased initiatives, and the MOD. The NSS also states that
Japan will strengthen the cross-government framework
for utilizing funding and information related to research


**1 Strengthening Technology Cooperation**
**with Relevant Domestic and Overseas**
**Entities and Collaboration with Relevant**
**Ministries and Agencies**

ATLA and domestic research institutions such as
national research and development agencies proactively
engage in research collaborations and technological
information exchanges in order to ensure that advanced
civilian technologies are incorporated and that research
and development is conducted efficiently.
Domestically, in order to create superior defense equipment
through the utilization of cutting-edge technologies and
conduct research and development efficiently and effectively,
the MOD has been collaborating closely with the Council
for Science, Technology and Innovation (CSTI)[3] and other

and development, and it is important for the entire
Government to work together based on this strategy.
Specifically, the Government will intensively offer
strong support for cutting-edge technology with multiple
applications, such as AI and quantum technology, through
programs, such as the Key and Advanced Technology
R&D through Cross Community Collaboration Program
(K-Program). The research and development results
obtained will smoothly reinforce security-related areas.
Furthermore, a framework will be established to expedite
the development of technologies with the potential to
contribute to the reinforcement of defense capabilities
by matching the research and development needs of
the MOD with the research and development projects
conducted by the relevant ministries and agencies.
Outside Japan, the MOD will continue to actively
promote technological and engineer exchanges with
allies and like-minded countries, as well as consider
diverse possibilities through continued exchange of
opinions at various opportunities.

**2 Identifying and Developing Innovative**
**Technologies and Their Seeds**


Active utilization of advanced civilian technology
through such programs is not only essential for securing
the lives and peaceful livelihood of Japanese nationals
into the future but is also beneficial for the development
of Japan’s science, technology, and innovation in
non-defense areas as well, similar to how investment
in innovative technology by the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the United States
facilitated advances in science and technology as a whole,
including civilian technology such as the development
of the Internet and GPS. From this perspective, the MOD
intends to promote relevant measures and strives to raise
awareness of this program that contributes to ensuring
the freedom of study and its sound development.
Advanced Technology Bridging Research was
launched in FY2020 to expedite the identification and
development of promising, advanced technologies from
the results of basic research under the Innovative Science
& Technology Initiative for Security and other sources,
enhance their level of technological maturity, and apply
them to the research and development of equipment.
Advanced Technology Bridging Research will be
conducted with a vastly expanded scope in FY2023
with the aim of helping to develop equipment that will
become game-changers in the future.
In addition, in order to accelerate the research and
development of equipment, the MOD launched its “Efforts
to Facilitate the Early Practical Use of Game-Changers”
starting in FY2022 as an initiative to commission
private companies to conduct research and improve their
advanced technologies to the point where they can be
used in the research and development of equipment.

See Fig. IV-1-2-3 (FY2022 Awarded Research Projects for the

“Innovative Science & Technology Initiative for Security”
Program)

**3 New Measures for Early Deployment**


**Part**
**Ⅳ**

**Chapter**


The MOD implemented a competitive research funding
program called “Innovative Science & Technology
Initiative for Security” to publicly seek and commission
basic research in target areas, which is expected to
contribute to future research and development in defense
areas. A total of 142 research projects have been awarded[5]
as of FY2022. This program will continue to promote the
discovery and development of innovative and emergent
technologies in FY2023 as well.
In the basic research areas, free thinking of researchers
leads to innovative and creative results. For this reason,
it is necessary to assign maximum value to freedom of
research when sponsoring research, so that, for example,
researchers will be able to publish all of their research
results to have a wide range of academic discussions.
Hence, in this program, the MOD will not intervene in
research, restrict contractors’ publication of research
results, or designate research results as confidential,
never providing any confidential data to researchers.
In actuality, some research results have already been
published through oral presentations, publications, etc.


A new framework will be established for programs that
are particularly urgent and significant from a policy
perspective in areas that could directly affect the SDF’s
current and future ways of warfare so that they can be
deployed in five years and achieve full-scale operation
in approximately ten years.

imported.[2] In light of this decision, Japan has been working
to enable the involvement of Japanese industries in the

manufacturing process in preparation for the acquisition
of F-35A fighter aircraft from FY2013 onwards. So
far, the Japanese companies have participated in Final
Assembly and Check Out (FACO) for the airframe and
engines, and the manufacture of related parts.
In light of the severe financial conditions, the MOD
decided in principle that it would resort to importing
completed aircraft for procurement in FY2019 and after,
but this would be reviewed if less expensive means were
available. Subsequently, however, as a result of cost
reduction efforts by the manufacturers and others, it was
confirmed that FACO by domestic companies would
make the price lower than importing completed aircraft.
For this reason, for procurements from FY2019 to
FY2027, the MOD has decided to procure F-35A fighters
for which domestic companies performed FACO.[3]

In addition, as F-35 fighter aircraft are operated
worldwide, the U.S. Government decided to establish
maintenance depot (regional MRO&U Capability)
mainly for airframes and engines in the North America,
Europe, and the Asia-Pacific regions.
The regional MRO&U in the Asia-Pacific region
for Japan’s F-35 fighter airframes selected by the U.S.
Government in December 2014 began operations at
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries’ Komaki South Plant
located in Aichi Prefecture from July 2020. Moreover,
with regard to the regional MRO&U Capability for
engines, the U.S. Government announced its decision in
December 2014 that initial capability will be provided by
Australia by early 2018, with Japan providing additional
capability at least 3-5 years later,[4] and preparations to
begin operations are currently underway.
The participation in the production of F-35 fighters
by Japanese industries continuously, the establishment
of maintenance depots for airframes, engines and others
within Japan, and the contribution to maintenance in


the Asia-Pacific region not only maintain, cultivate, and
reinforce Japan’s defense production and technology
bases but are also significant from the perspectives of
securing the operational support system for F-35A
fighter aircraft in Japan, strengthening the Japan-U.S.
Alliance, and deepening equipment cooperation in the
Indo-Pacific region.

**(2) Initiatives towards the Establishment of the**
**Common Maintenance Base for Ospreys of Japan**
**and the U.S.**

In October 2015, Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.[5] was
selected as the maintenance company for the Planned
Maintenance Interval (PMI) of the U.S. Marine Corps
Ospreys deployed at Marine Corps Air Station Futenma.
From February 2017, the PMI has been performed at
GSDF Camp Kisarazu, with the maintenance of five
aircraft completed as of the end of March 2023 and four
aircraft currently under maintenance.
The MOD intends to establish a common maintenance
base for both Japan’s and the United States’ Ospreys by
allowing the maintenance company to use the hangar
at GSDF Camp Kisarazu for aircraft maintenance of
the U.S. Marine Corps Ospreys and to carry out future
aircraft maintenance of the GSDF Ospreys (V-22) at
the same camp in view of the (1) smooth introduction
of the V-22;[6] (2) smooth and effective operation of the
Japan-U.S. security arrangements; and (3) enhanced
efficiency in maintenance. The establishment of a
common maintenance base at GSDF Camp Kisarazu
would be extremely significant in that it will contribute
to mitigating the burden on Okinawa as well as to the
“strengthening of the infrastructure for the repair and
maintenance of common equipment” stated in the JapanU.S. Guidelines.

In December 2019, December 2020, December 2021, and December 2022, it was decided to opt for manufacturing arrangements involving domestic companies for F-35A fighter aircraft
procurements in FY2019 and FY2020, FY2021, FY2022, and FY2023 through FY2027, respectively, as such arrangements were confirmed to be more cost-effective.

The regional MRO&U for engines in Japan is planned to be located at IHI Corporation (Mizuho Aero-Engine Works in Tokyo).

The company was renamed SUBARU Corporation on April 1, 2017.

The GSDF will introduce 17 tilt-rotor aircraft (Osprey (V-22)) that can complement and strengthen the capabilities of transport helicopters (CH-47JA) in terms of cruising speed and range. As a

Surrounded by an increasingly severe security
environment, it has become even more important for
Japan that the nations which have a cooperative and
friendly relationship with Japan in terms of security and
defense have appropriate capabilities. It is also critical to
develop a foundation that will serve as the basis for the
international community to cooperate towards improving
the security environment.
Among these friendly nations, some have difficulties
in acquiring an adequate level of defense equipment on
their own because of the scale of their economy and fiscal
situation. Some of these states have been requesting to
use SDF equipment that is no longer in use.
Under these circumstances, to respond to the needs
of such friendly nations, the MOD established a special
provision under Article 9, paragraph (1) of the Public
Finance Act[23] in the SDF Act, which came into force in
June 2017. The provision enables the MOD to grant or
transfer SDF equipment that is no longer in use to the
governments of developing states at a lower price than
the current price.

**Adapting Defense Equipment for External Use**
**4**


With regard to aircraft, since there is much in the
technology base shared between the defense and civilian
sectors, taking measures to contribute to the revitalization
of the civilian sector will contribute to maintaining and
activating the industrial base of Japanese aircraft, as well
as to maintaining and reinforcing the defense industrial
base of Japan. It is from this perspective that the MOD
has been considering the civilian use of aircraft that it
has developed.
So far, it has compiled guidelines on designing a system
for the civilian use of defense equipment and established
an application system for companies interested in such
use. In response to applications from companies, it has
disclosed technical data on the F7-10 engine of the
P-1 patrol aircraft and on the US-2 search and rescue
amphibious aircraft for the purpose of civilian use. ATLA
and IHI Corporation, a company that manufactures


the F7-10 engine, signed a contract in 2016 as the first
instance of civilian use of the F7-10 engine for sales to
the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). The
engine was delivered to JAXA in 2019.
Considering there have been inquiries about
equipment other than aircraft from foreign governments
since the establishment of the Three Principles on
Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology, the
term was changed from “Adapting Defense Equipment
for Civilian Use” to “Adapting Defense Equipment
for External Use,” for which rules of procedure were
established in 2018. In 2019, technical data, etc., for
adapting defense equipment for external use concerning
the automatic flight control computer processing unit
and ship landing assist system of the SH-60K (upgraded
capability) were disclosed in response to applications
from companies.



**Participation in International Defense Equipment Exhibitions**

ATLA participates in international defense equipment
exhibitions to introduce Japan’s defense equipment
policies and advanced technology. These initiatives help
foreign government officials to better understand Japan’s
equipment policies and technology, and contribute to
building bases for the promotion of defense equipment
and technology cooperation.
In light of the fact that international joint development and
production of equipment has become mainstream, Japan’s
exhibition at Eurosatory 2022 focused on creating a broader
appeal through its superior technological capabilities at the
component level, including the components of radars and
combat vehicles. This concept was created based on the
idea of actively pursuing cooperation not only through the
transfer of finished products but also through the supply of
components and parts.


In addition, at the VIETNAM DEFENSE EXPO
2022, Japan’s superior technological capabilities which

cooperation between the public and private sectors. In
cooperation with trading companies and manufacturing
companies, ATLA has conducted Feasibility Studies to
grasp the potential needs of target countries and carried
out activities for proposals since FY2020.
The ATLA has held the Defense Industry Forum, in
which defense authorities and companies from both
countries meet to exchange views on the overseas
transfer of defense equipment between Japan and the
partner country, with six countries so far: Indonesia
(held in August 2017), India, Vietnam, Australia, Italy,
and the Philippines.

opportunities for learning about cases from the private
business sector involving other countries and the current
status of defense equipment and technology cooperation.
Besides holding webinars of India, Vietnam, and
Malaysia since its first webinar in December 2020, the
MOD also held a webinar in October 2022 for learning
about systems and experiences of equipment exporters
in the western countries which has extensive experience
in the export of equipment.
Additionally, the ATLA developed a portal site in
March 2022 designed to provide a platform for sharing
information on the overseas transfer of defense equipment
between the public and private sectors, which has long
been requested by the defense industry. The portal site
provides information on countries’ procurement systems
and Japan’s defense equipment transfer system for
defense-related companies that are working on overseas
transfers.

in ATLA undertakes project management throughout
the life cycle of equipment upon selecting important
equipment, and promotes efforts to realize the optimized
equipment acquisition.
Specifically, the MOD has selected 22 items for major
programs designated for project management and 13
items for semi-major programs for project management[2]
as of the end of March 2023. For major programs
designated for project management, the MOD designates
a Project Manager (PM) dedicated to each specific major
program, following which project management for that
program is conducted by an Integrated Project Team
(IPT), which is composed of officials from relevant
divisions within the MOD.
For each of the 35 major and semi-major programs
designated for project management as of the end of March
2023, the MOD has formulated an Acquisition Strategy and
an Acquisition Plan (hereinafter referred to as “Designated
Item Plans”), which specify the basic matters necessary to
systematically implement project management until the
present, such as the purpose of the acquisition program,
acquisition policy, and life cycle cost.
Furthermore, in principle, ATLA annually reviews the
implementation status of the Designated Item Plans and
endeavors to promote appropriate project management
that reflects the latest status by conducting analysis
and evaluation, on the basis of which the Designated
Item Plans are reviewed as necessary. In March 2023,
analysis and evaluation of the acquisition program were
implemented for the 35 major and semi-major programs
which had been designated for project management.


generated by component (Work Breakdown Structure
(WBS))[3]. Since April 2020, efforts have been made for
the public and private sectors to jointly manage costs and
schedules through the use of an incentivized risk-sharing
management contract system, which allows for the early
detection of cost increases and schedule delays and for
action to be taken promptly (see 4-3).
b. Method for More Accurate Cost Estimate
Life cycle cost has been estimated based on actual cost
data of similar equipment developed or introduced in the
past. However, as a larger amount of cost data is needed
for a more accurate estimate, the MOD promotes the
establishment of a cost database by collecting cost data
and accumulating them into a database.
c. Accumulation and Development of Expertise
For further improving the management skills of PMs and
enhancing human resources among those who engage in
project management, the MOD provides opportunities to
study project management methods from overseas and
the private sector on a regular basis.

**(2) Future Initiatives**
In order to further promote effective and efficient
equipment acquisition, the MOD needs to enhance the
effectiveness and flexibility of project management
throughout equipment life cycles. Therefore, the DBP
stipulates that further efforts for effective and efficient
acquisition of equipment will include cost reduction
through planned and stable acquisition of equipment
by expanding the application of long-term contracts,
improving the predictability of companies and promoting
efficient production, procurement in consideration of the
supply-demand situation of equipment including that
of other countries, and narrowing down the SDF’s own
unique specifications that cause costs to rise.

**Improving the Contract System and Other Related Matters**
**4**


In addition, by implementing longer-term, multipleyear contracts utilizing the Private Finance Initiative
(PFI) Act,[7] the planned acquisition and execution of
budgets is achieved through the equalization of national
expenditure. At the same time, certain benefits, such as
lower equipment procurement costs by reducing risks
for the parties taking orders and by promoting the entry
of new suppliers, can be obtained.
In addition, regarding the procurement of certain
equipment for which little competitiveness can be
expected due to its characteristics, and for companies
that work on cost reduction by utilizing the MOD’s
programs, the MOD ensures transparency and fairness
and promotes the appropriate use of limited tendering
contracts after clarifying and categorizing the targets,
with a view to implementing prompt and efficient
procurement and enhancing predictability for companies.

**3 Measures to Lower Procurement Costs**
**and Incentivize Companies to Reduce**
**Cost**


**1 Reviewing Acquisition Systems**


In order to promptly respond to changes in the
surroundings, the MOD has been reviewing acquisition
systems through meetings of the Comprehensive
Acquisition Reform Committee since 2007 and the
Contract Systems Study Group comprising experts since
2010. Since FY2016, a special research officer system[4]
has been adopted to properly implement the review
results in practice.

**2 Long-Term Contracts, etc.**


**Part**
**Ⅳ**

**Chapter**


The production of defense equipment requires a
significant amount of time. Therefore, if a certain amount
is to be procured in bulk, a contract for more than five
years is needed in many cases. With regard to defense
equipment and services, economies of scale[5] tend not to
work mainly due to the following reasons: (1) the MOD
is the only customer; and (2) companies that provide
such defense equipment, etc., are limited. In addition, it
is difficult for companies to systematically move forward
with their businesses with a high degree of predictability,
a trait that is peculiar to the defense industry.
For these reasons, although the period of expenditure
for acts that incur national debt is limited to five years in
principle under the Public Finance Act, this period has
been extended to a maximum of ten years for specific
equipment through the enactment of the Long-term
Contract Act.[6] The introduction of this change regarding
long-term contracts will make stable procurement
possible, leading to the realization of the systematic
improvement of defense capability. At the same time, for
companies, given that the procurement amount will be
assured, the systematic use of personnel and equipment,
as well as cost reductions due to bulk orders, will be
made possible.

See Part II, Chapter 4, Section 1-12 (Optimization Efforts); Part II,

See

Chapter 4, Section 3-4 (Optimization Efforts)


With regard to the procurement of defense equipment,
the cost is tending to increase because a large variety
of equipment has no market price. Based on those
characteristics, it is necessary to achieve both the
reduction of procurement cost and improvement of
companies’ incentives to reduce cost simultaneously.
In order to achieve this, ATLA has applied the
incentivized risk-sharing management contract system
to the next-generation fighter aircraft project and the
stand-off electronic warfare aircraft project since April
2020, under which the public and private sectors jointly
manage the performance and progress of the contract and
the cost, with a certain percentage of any cost reduction
achieved awarded to the contractor. In addition, a system
to provide incentives for cost reductions has also been
implemented since April 2020 in order to evaluate the
companies’ own cost reduction efforts. The expansion


This is a system of conducting research that contributes to the procurement system of defense equipment by inviting experts, such as associate professors from universities specializing in the areas
of concern, on a part-time basis to effectively review the procurement system based not only on the viewpoints of MOD personnel involved in actual operations but also on theories proposed in the
fields of business administration and economics.

“Economies of scale” refer to the cost advantage that arises from an increased output of a product. For example, the cost per unit can be reduced with the bulk purchase of materials.

“Special Measures Law Concerning the Term of Expenditure Based on the Obligatory Assurance of National Subsidization for Specific Defense Procurement” (enacted in April 2015. An act for its
partial revision to extend the effective period by five years was enacted in March 2019.)

along with life extension and improvement of existing
equipment, the MOD/SDF will efficiently secure
necessary and sufficient quality and quantity of defense
capability. In this regard, the MOD/SDF will strengthen
its project management throughout its equipment lifecycle, including during its research and development
activities, and reduce the life-cycle costs to improve costeffectiveness. In addition, by incorporating advanced
civilian technologies, the MOD/SDF will steadily
realize acceleration of defense equipment deployment
for areas that could directly affect the SDF’s current and
future ways of warfare and are particularly urgent and
significant from a policy perspective.

With regard to periodic maintenance of defense
equipment, the MOD has been working to improve
efficiency by extending the maintenance interval, after

as Performance Based Logistics (PBL) with a view to
improving the operational availability of equipment and
keeping long-term costs under control.

prevent the recurrence of misconduct, enhance fairness
and transparency, and ensure proper contracting.
In addition, ATLA carries out multilayered checks
on the contracts it administers through both internal
and external checking systems and checks and balances
within the organization. Specifically, ATLA will further
enhance internal inspections by the Inspection and Audit
Department as well as defense inspections conducted
by the Inspector General’s Office of Legal Compliance
and deliberations by the Defense Procurement Council,
which is composed of external experts. Moreover, ATLA
has also improved its education department and strives
to enhance compliance awareness by providing thorough
education pertaining to compliance for ATLA personnel.

improving the transparency in pricing.
In addition, in April 2023, ATLA and the U.S.
Department of Defense concluded a framework to
confirm reciprocal and free-of-charge quality assurance
services for defense products, etc. This framework
waives quality assurance fee for FMS procurement,
which reduces FMS procurement costs and strengthens
collaborative relations within Japan-U.S. Alliance in
procurement, thereby advancing the effectiveness of
FMS procurement.

The MOD implements measures for making contracts
more appropriate and strengthening checking functions
to promote the enhancement of fairness and transparency
in relation to the acquisition of equipment and materials.
As part of its efforts to achieve more appropriate
public procurement across the whole government,
the MOD continues to carry out the introduction and
expansion of a comprehensive evaluation bidding
system[8] and make bidding procedures more efficient.
In addition to these, based on the lessons learned from
past incidents such as overcharging and falsification
of the results of equipment testing by defense-related
companies, measures such as strengthening system

characteristics of FMS include: (1) prices are estimates,
(2) payments are made in advance in principle and
balanced out after fulfillment, and (3) delivery dates
are estimates. FMS is critical to reinforcing the defense
capabilities of Japan.
Meanwhile, there are FMS-related various issues,
such as late delivery and late case closure. As the FMS
procurement amount is hovering at a high level in recent
years, the governments of Japan and the U.S. have been
actively working together to make improvements in
these issues.
Specifically, ATLA and Defense Security Cooperation
Agency (DSCA) have held the Security Cooperation
Consultative Meeting (SCCM) to discuss the issues over
FMS procurement seven times since 2016.
At the 7th SCCM held in January 2023, Japan and the
U.S. agreed to continue strengthening case management
between them in terms of late delivery and late case

for SDF Personnel)

Personnel management of uniformed SDF personnel
differs from that of general civilian government
employees[2] due to the need to maintain the SDF’s
strength. With consideration given to the knowledge,
experience, physical strength, and other factors
necessary to perform the duties of the respective ranks,
the SDF has an “Early Retirement System” where the
majority of uniformed personnel retire in their mid-50s
and a “Fixed-Term System” where one term lasts two or
three years.


**(2) Administrative Officials, Technical and**
**Engineering Officials, Instructors, and Other**
**Civilian Personnel**

There are approximately 21,000 civilian personnel—
administrative officials, technical and engineering
officials, instructors, and others—in addition to uniformed
SDF personnel in the MOD/SDF.[3] Civilian personnel
are mainly recruited from those who have passed the
Recruitment Examination for Comprehensive and
General Service National Public Employees conducted
by the National Personnel Authority (NPA) and those who
have passed the Recruitment Examination for Ministry of
Defense Specialists conducted by the MOD.
Administrative officials are engaged in defense

SDF personnel are designated as special national government employees under Article 2 of the National Civil Service Law.

Among the employees of the MOD, special national government employees are called “SDF personnel,” including administrative officials, technical and engineering officials, instructors, and others,

related policy planning in the Internal Bureaus of the
MOD and at the Acquisition, Technology and Logistics
Agency (ATLA); analysis and evaluation at the Defense
Intelligence Headquarters (DIH); and administrative
works at the SDF bases, the Regional Defense Bureaus,
and other locations throughout the country.
Technical and engineering officials are engaged in
policy planning related to defense facilities (headquarters,
runways, magazines, etc.) and physical infrastructure
such as defense equipment at the Internal Bureaus of the
MOD and ATLA; analysis and evaluation at the DIH;
and constructing various defense facilities, carrying
out research and development, efficient procurement,
maintenance and development of a range of equipment,
providing mental health care for SDF personnel, and
other duties at SDF bases, Regional Defense Bureaus,


and other locations nationwide.
Instructors conduct advanced research on defense and
provide high-quality education to SDF personnel at the
National Defense Academy, National Defense Medical
College, National Institute for Defense Studies, and
other organizations.
In response to the “Directive for Organization and
Allocation of Personnel Expenses in FY2023 to Proceed
with the Core Issues of the Cabinet Office” (decision
by the Prime Minister on July 29, 2022), which stated
“strengthening diplomacy, national security, and
economic security,” the MOD has increased the number
of defense officials.

**Utilization of SDF Reserve Personnel and others**
**2**


It is essential to secure the required number of uniformed
SDF personnel promptly depending on situational
changes in the event of a crisis. To secure the required
number promptly and systematically, the MOD maintains
the following three systems: the SDF Reserve Personnel
system, the SDF Ready Reserve Personnel system, and
the Candidates for SDF Reserve Personnel system.[4]

See Fig. IV-2-1-3 (Overview of Systems Related to SDF Reserve

See

Personnel)

SDF Reserve Personnel become uniformed SDF personnel
upon the issuance of a defense call-up order or other
orders, and carry out logistical support and base guard
duties. SDF Ready Reserve Personnel become uniformed
SDF personnel and are assigned to carry out their mission
together with active-duty uniformed SDF personnel as
part of frontline units following the issuance of a defense
call-up order or other orders. Candidates for SDF Reserve
Personnel, some of whom are recruited among those with
no prior experience as uniformed SDF personnel, are
appointed as SDF Reserve Personnel after completing the
necessary education and training. Also, since the system
was established in FY2001, the technical categories for
Candidates for SDF Reserve Personnel have been gradually
expanded, with system protection personnel (cyberspace)
and nursery teachers added to the list in FY2022.
Since SDF Reserve Personnel and others are engaged


in their respective jobs under normal circumstances, the
understanding and cooperation of the companies that
employ these personnel are essential for them to attend
regular training, etc.
For this purpose, the MOD provides a special subsidy to
the companies that employ SDF Ready Reserve Personnel
and take necessary measures to allow such employees to
attend training sessions for 30 days a year, by taking into
consideration the burden on such companies.
Moreover, in order to secure their understanding and
cooperation regarding the duties of SDF Reserve Personnel
and SDF Ready Reserve Personnel, employers are
provided with a subsidy in the event that (1) SDF Reserve
Personnel or SDF Ready Reserve Personnel respond to a
defense operation call-up order, civil protection dispatch
call-up order, or disaster relief call-up order, etc., or if (2)
they have no choice but to leave their regular occupations
due to injuries during their duties, etc.
In addition, a special subsidy for companies that
cooperate with the training of SDF Ready Reserve
Personnel is paid to companies that employ individuals
who, after being Candidates for SDF Reserve Personnel
with no prior experience as uniformed SDF personnel,
are appointed as SDF Ready Reserve Personnel after
completing the necessary education and training as
SDF Reserve Personnel, and which take the necessary


-----

measures to ensure that such employees can attend
training sessions with peace of mind.
During a disaster relief mission to prevent COVID-19
from spreading, SDF Reserve Personnel with medical
qualification were called up to carry out their missions,
including providing medical support at SDF hospitals
and other facilities.[5]

Based on the DBP, the roles to be played by SDF
Reserve Personnel and others will be reviewed so that they
can effectively supplement regular SDF personnel amid
the changing operational environment and diversifying
missions of the SDF. Upon doing so, the MOD/SDF will
expand the recruitment of civilians with no experience
in the SDF and review the current system in light of age


limits, training periods, and other issues. In view of this,
the upper age limit for the continued appointment of
SDF Reserve Personnel who possess certain skills was
abolished in March 2023 on a trial basis.
Also, the MOD is promoting the use of SDF Reserve
Personnel in a wide range of fields, such as the appointment
of retired SDF pilots who are re-employed in the private sector
through the re-employment system as SDF Reserve Personnel.[6]

a portion of vessel crew operations and aircraft pilotage
tasks were made available to reappointed personnel.
At the same time, the MOD/SDF is creating a support

promotion of AI application, etc., while building a
necessary environment for AI application by educating
MOD/SDF personnel with outsourced courses, etc., with
the aim of promoting manpower saving and automation.
In addition, a crew system of rotating shift duty
among multiple teams of crew has been introduced on
some vessels in order to ensure an adequate operating
ratio with a limited number of personnel.

**MOD Personnel**


**1 Effective Use of Human Resources**

With regard to the personnel structure of the SDF, the
authorized number of SDF personnel has been on a
decline. On the other hand, there has been the need for
more-skilled personnel and personnel with expertise in
order to respond to the sophistication of equipment as
well as the diversification and internationalization of
SDF missions.
In light of such circumstances, the mandatory early
retirement age of SDF personnel was raised by one
year after 2020 in order to ensure further utilization
of older human resources with rich knowledge, skills,
and experience. Based on the DBP, the retirement ages
of personnel from the rank of Ichii (Captain (Ground

The suicide counts among MOD personnel was 79 in
FY2022. The fact that MOD personnel have lost their
precious lives to suicide is truly tragic for the families
of the deceased. It is also a huge loss to the organization.

See Fig. IV-2-1-5 (Changes in the Number of Suicide Deaths

among MOD Personnel)

In FY2022, the MOD developed the “Basic Policy on
Mental Health in the Ministry of Defense” and adopted
various measures with a view to preventing suicide
among its personnel.
Specifically, the MOD has engaged in conducting
mental health checks for all personnel, raising awareness,
by educating them to make use of counseling services,
improving the work environments by promoting
measures related to work-life balance, and strengthening
the support system by collaborating with supervisors and
counselors and diversifying consultation channels.

In addition to exchanges between units and personnel’s
families, as well as between the families, the MOD
in cooperation with relevant external groups and
organizations is also actively working to develop a
family support system to be implemented in the event of
large-scale natural disasters and other events, which will
include receiving cooperation in confirming the safety of


-----

the family members of SDF personnel.
In addition, the MOD is promoting various types of
support measures for the families of SDF personnel. For
units dispatched overseas or to vessels for operations
expected to continue for an extended period of time, the
MOD has been creating a communication environment
that allows the personnel and their families to get in
direct contact. Moreover, for units dispatched overseas,


the MOD has been implementing a range of support
measures for the families of the personnel, including
supporting additional shipments of comfort items sent
from families to SDF personnel on dispatch, holding
briefing sessions and establishing consultation desks
(family support centers) for families, and creating a
website for the families of SDF personnel.

the National Defense Academy. At the same time, MOD/
SDF will promote integration of educational programs
and promote utilization of state-of-the-art technologies.
Furthermore, education requires considerable human,
time, and economic commitment, including securing
instructors with special skills as well as improving
equipment and educational facilities. In the event that
personnel need to further improve their professional
knowledge and skills, or that it is difficult for them to
acquire such knowledge and skills within the SDF,
the MOD/SDF commissions education to external
institutions, including those abroad, as well as domestic
companies and research institutes.

environment but also the increase in the number of new
missions. It also calls for reviewing the future salaries of
SDF personnel by studying the salary systems of military
personnel in other countries.
In addition, a survey on the working hours of SDF
personnel has been conducted since April 2023.
At the same time, to ensure that SDF personnel can
execute their missions with high morale and pride,
measures related to honors and privileges, including
the appropriate commendation of achievements, will be
promoted.

**2 Commemorating Personnel who**
**Perished in the Line of Duty**


**1 Improvement of Treatment**

Because SDF personnel execute their missions in a
challenging environment, efforts have been made to
improve their treatment based on the special nature of
their missions and work environments. In FY2022, the
scope of allowances paid to SDF personnel who carry
out dangerous transport missions using helicopters
and provide emergency life-saving treatment under
challenging circumstances was expanded, while
measures were adopted to alleviate the burden on
personnel on long-term duties. In FY2023, allowances
will be newly paid to radar site personnel who perform
warning and surveillance duties under harsh working
conditions.
The DBP stipulates that, through conducting surveys
on overtime work performed by SDF personnel, etc., the
treatment of SDF personnel will be improved in light of
not only the special nature of their missions and work


Since the establishment of the National Police Reserve in
1950, SDF personnel have endeavored to complete their

of danger. During this time period, however, more than
2,000 personnel have lost their lives in the line of duty.
In the MOD/SDF, funeral ceremonies are carried out
by the respective units to which SDF personnel who
perished in the line of duty belonged in order to express
condolences. Moreover, in order to eternally recognize
the achievements of the personnel who perished in
the line of duty and to express the deepest respect and
condolences, memorial ceremonies are carried out
in various forms, such as the Memorial Service for
members of SDF personnel who lost their lives in the
line of duty conducted with the participation of the Prime
Minister. Achievements of 35 SDF members (16 GSDF,
15 MSDF, and 4 ASDF members) who lost their lives in
the line of duty were recognized in a Memorial Service
in FY2022.[7]

their duties and vocational training. Therefore, they
are making positive contributions in a broad range of
sectors, including manufacturing and service industries,
as well as finance, insurance, real estate, and construction
industries, in addition to the areas of disaster prevention
and risk management at local governments.
Specifically, as of the end of March 2023, a total of
640 retired SDF personnel work as crisis management
officers and others at local governments’ disaster
prevention bureaus: 46 prefectural bureaus have 107
of them in total, and 455 municipal bureaus have 533.
Since strengthening cooperation between the MOD/
SDF and local governments will help to reinforce the
crisis management capabilities of local governments,
efforts are also being made to strengthen re-employment
support in this regard.
Furthermore, the MOD offers disaster prevention
and crisis management education for retiring SDF
personnel who seek employment in disaster prevention
departments of local governments. An individual who
completes the course is certified as a regional disaster
prevention manager by the Cabinet Office upon request.
The requirement for this certification is a rank of at least
Ichii or a rank of Nii (First Lieutenant (GSDF, ASDF)/
Lieutenant Junior Grade (MSDF)) with the effective
work experience of an Ichii (Captain (GSDF, ASDF)/
Lieutenant (MSDF)).
In March 2022, the MOD and the specified non-profit
organization Japan Bousaisi Organization came to an
agreement to establish a special exception for uniformed
SDF personnel in the certification process for disaster
prevention officers, with the goal of reinforcing regional
disaster prevention capabilities.
In order to increase the number of SDF Reserve
Personnel and SDF Ready Reserve Personnel, in addition
to maintaining and increasing the number of uniformed
SDF personnel under the fixed-term system, it is decided
that a scholarship would be provided to support the
education of individuals who enter a university in Japan
after completing their tenure as fixed-term uniformed
SDF personnel and who are appointed SDF Reserve
Personnel while at university.

**Chapter**


In order to maintain the SDF’s strength, most uniformed
SDF personnel retire in their mid-50s, while fixed-term
uniformed SDF personnel retire in their 20s or mid-30s.
For many uniformed SDF personnel, re-employment
is essential to safeguard their livelihood. Therefore, it
is of paramount importance to provide re-employment
support for active uniformed SDF personnel in order to
relieve their anxiety about the future and allow them to
devote themselves to their duties.
The DBP also states that it is the responsibility of
the Government to secure the livelihood of uniformed
SDF personnel after their retirement. It also calls for
the MOD/SDF to further improve and strengthen reemployment support such as by enhancing the career
guidance system and job training opportunities and by
strengthening cooperation with relevant organizations
and private companies.
Retired uniformed SDF personnel have excellent
abilities in planning, leadership, faculty, cooperativeness,
and responsibility gained through their work
performance, education and training. Furthermore, they
have various qualifications and licenses acquired through


The Monument for SDF Personnel who Perished in the Line of Duty was constructed in 1962 in Ichigaya. In 1998, the Memorial Zone in its current form was completed by combining this monument
with other monuments located in the same area. The MOD holds an annual memorial ceremony for SDF personnel who perished in the line of duty, led by the Minister of Defense and with the
attendance of surviving family members and the Prime Minister. At the Monument for SDF Personnel who Perished in the Line of Duty in the Memorial Zone, there is an iron plate containing the
names and other information of personnel who perished in the line of duty. When foreign dignitaries such as Defense Ministers visit the MOD, they make offerings of flowers, expressing their respect

Fig. IV-2-1-6 Major Vocational Training Provided to Support Re-employment

In order to maintain the strength of the SDF, many uniformed SDF personnel retire in their mid-50s (personnel serving under the
early retirement system) or in their 20s to mid-30s (uniformed SDF personnel serving under the fixed-term service system).
Since supporting re-employment is the responsibility of the Japanese Government (the MOD) as the employer, and is crucial both

for resolving any concerns that uniformed SDF personnel may have about their future as well as for securing qualified human

resources, the MOD conducts support measures such as occupational training useful for their re-employment.

As part of the efforts, the MOD/SDF is encouraging all
male personnel with a new born child to take paternity
leave or time off work for a total of one month or more.
The MOD/SDF is also developing an environment
that enables its personnel to balance work life with
their family life through various initiatives, such as by
providing explanations on systems related to childcare
and nursing care, introducing role models, and creating
“childcare forms” to help managers and the human
resources department better understand the details of the
situation surrounding their staff’s childcare. A system
has also been established to allow SDF personnel who
retired mid-career due to childcare or nursing care
commitments to be re-employed.

further flexibility was introduced, including a reduction
in core hours under the flextime system.
In addition, some personnel are now able to telework,

Developing an environment in which SDF personnel

in maintaining a permanent state of readiness. The MOD/
SDF has set up workplace nurseries at camps and bases
in eight locations across Japan. In addition, in the event
of situations where a quick response is required such as
disaster relief, the MOD promotes support measures to
provide temporary childcare in SDF camps and bases for
children of SDF personnel.


The MOD/SDF has developed various schemes that
enable its personnel to balance work with their childcare/
nursing care commitments, such as hiring fixed-term

For the further expansion of the recruitment and

up specific goals with regard to the recruitment and
promotion of female personnel under the Action Plan.


**1 Significance of Promoting Active**

complex, SDF personnel are required more than ever to
have multifaceted capabilities, including higher levels
of knowledge, decision-making ability, and skills. In

the declining birth rate and continuing trend of higher
education, it is anticipated that the number of SDF
personnel with time and location restraints, including
those involved in childcare, nursing care, and other
responsibilities, will significantly increase.
In light of these changes, the SDF is required to evolve
from a conventional organization with an emphasis on
homogeneity among the members, into an organization
that is capable of incorporating diverse human resources
in a flexible manner.
At present, the largest human resource that the SDF has
not been able to fully utilize is women, who account for
half of the population targeted for recruitment. Promoting
the active engagement of female SDF personnel has
the following significance: (1) securing useful human
resources; (2) utilizing diverse perspectives; and (3)
reflecting values of the nation. For this reason, the
MOD/SDF has decided to open up a path for female
personnel with motivation, ability, and aptitude to have
opportunities to demonstrate their abilities in various
fields, with the aim of doubling the ratio of female SDF
personnel.
In terms of employing and promoting female
SDF personnel, the MOD/SDF sets out a personnel
management policy to ensure equal opportunity between
men and women and assign the right person to the right
place based on the person’s motivation and ability/
aptitude.


The MOD/SDF has completely removed the assignment
restriction of female SDF personnel with the exception of
units to which female personnel cannot be assigned for
reasons of maternity protection (namely, part of the GSDF
Nuclear Biological Chemical (NBC) Weapon Defense
Unit [chemical] as well as Tunnel Company Units).
As a result, the assignment of female personnel to
vocations, such as fighter pilots, paratroopers, and
submarine crew members, is currently underway.

**3 Expansion of the Recruitment and**
**Promotion of Female Personnel**


Under the Action Plan, efforts will be made for the
systematic expansion of the recruitment and promotion
of female personnel based on the numerical targets
specified for recruitment and promotion.

**(1) Female SDF Personnel**
As of the end of March 2023, the number of female SDF
personnel is about 20,000 (about 8.7% of the total SDF
personnel). Compared with ten years ago (end of March
2013 when female SDF personnel made up about 5.5%
of the total SDF personnel), this is a rise of 3.2 percentage
points, indicating that the ratio of female SDF personnel
has been on the rise in recent years.
Regarding the recruitment of female SDF personnel,
the targets for the proportion of newly employed

female SDF personnel among total newly employed
SDF personnel in and after FY2021 and the proportion
of female SDF personnel among total SDF personnel
by FY2030 have increased to at least 17% and 12%,
respectively. In addition, the MOD/SDF will improve
education, living, and work environments for female
SDF personnel in line with the increasing number of
female SDF personnel recruited.
In addition, with regard to promotion, the MOD/SDF
aims to increase the proportion of women among SDF
personnel with a rank of field officer or higher to at least
5% by the end of FY2025.

See Fig. IV-2-3-1 (Changes in Incumbent Female SDF Personnel)

**(2) Female Administrative Officials, Technical and**
**Engineering Officials, Instructors, and Other**
**Female Civilian Personnel**

As of the end of March 2023, the number of female
civilian personnel—administrative officials, technical


and engineering officials, instructors, and others—is
approximately 5,400 (about 26.9% of the total civilian
personnel). Compared with ten years ago (end of March
2013 when females made up about 23.5% of the total
civilian personnel), this is a rise of 3.4 percentage points,
indicating that the ratio of female civilian personnel has
been on the rise in recent years.
With regard to recruitment, in line with the overall
government target, the MOD has set the goal of ensuring
that women account for over 35% of recruits in and after
FY2021. Regarding promotion targets to be achieved
by the end of FY2025 include increasing the proportion
of women of the unit chief level at the MOD proper
or its equivalent to 35%, the division director at local

development of medical training infrastructure necessary
for combat injury education and common to all SDFs.
In addition to the above, the SDF will work on the
establishment of a new system to autonomously secure
and stockpile blood products. Most deaths in war are due
to exsanguination from bomb wounds, and other similar
causes. To prevent such deaths, it is extremely important
to secure blood products for transfusions. For this
reason, the FY2023 budget will include the installation
of related equipment at the SDF Central Hospital and the
conduct of the necessary reviews.

equipment of the GSDF, MSDF, and ASDF, which
include war injury treatment on board ships and aircraft
while promoting the development of training equipment
for medical transport by air and teaching materials for


The role of SDF hospitals is to admit and treat injured
SDF personnel and other persons transported from their
area of activity in various emergency situations. In
peacetime, these hospitals also provide medical care to
SDF personnel and their families, etc. These hospitals
also play the role of educational institutions that train
medical personnel to maintain and enhance their skills.
In the southwestern region of Japan, the geographical
characteristics of its many remote islands make it
necessary to strengthen the functions of Naha Hospital
and other hospitals that serve as medical bases.



**Securing and Training Medical Personnel**

The MOD/SDF is working to secure and nurture medical
officers and maintain and improve their medical skills
by enhancing clinical education after graduation from
the NDMC and other institutions, promoting various
initiatives for ensuring more opportunities for medical
officers to engage in medical practice, and helping them
acquire and improve specialized knowledge and skills in
areas such as infectious diseases and emergency medicine.


Similar measures are taken for nursing officers to
maintain and improve their knowledge/skills through
practice at external hospitals, etc.
Moreover, medical personnel and medical staff, such
as radiological technologists, clinical technologists,
and emergency life-saving technicians, are educated
and trained at SDF hospitals, schools and other relevant
institutions so that the SDF can perform diverse

**1 Training that Contributes to Reinforcing**
**Japan’s Capability to Respond to**
**Various Contingencies**

**(1) Joint Training of the SDF**
It is of paramount importance that the SDF be prepared
to seamlessly and fully demonstrate its deterrence and
response capabilities through repeated training involving
joint operations of the GSDF, MSDF, and ASDF on a
routine basis.
To this end, the SDF has been conducting SDF
joint exercises since 1979 to rehearse joint operations
by alternating between field training exercises and
command post exercises almost every year.
In addition, in order to respond to large-scale disasters
and various other disasters in an expeditious and
appropriate manner, the SDF organizes various disaster
prevention drills while also actively participating in
disaster prevention drills organized by the Japanese
Government and local governments as part of its efforts
to strengthen cooperation with various ministries and
agencies, local governments, etc.
Furthermore, the SDF has been conducting training
regularly so that it can promptly rescue or transport
Japanese nationals overseas, in emergency situations.

[SDF Joint Exercise (JX) for FY2022]
From January to February 2023, the SDF conducted its
joint exercise for FY2022 as a command post exercise.
The exercise was conducted in a comprehensive manner
based on a series of hypothetical scenarios ranging
from gray-zone situations to armed attack situations in
order to respond to armed attacks in various domains,
including in the space, cyberspace and electromagnetic
domains. This was the first large-scale exercise to
be conducted since the formulation of the new NSS
and in view of Japan’s approach to the fundamental
reinforcement of defense capabilities going forward, and
the lessons learned from the exercise will contribute to
this fundamental reinforcement of defense capabilities.

[Joint Exercise for Rescue (JXR)]
In order to maintain and enhance its disaster response
capabilities, the SDF conducts disaster drills revolving
around its command and staff activities in the event of a
large-scale earthquake, the coordination between major
units, and its coordination with disaster prevention
organizations as well as the U.S. Forces in Japan. During
the exercise, the SDF tested its response plan based on the
hypothetical scenario that a Nankai Trough earthquake

The SDF conducted field training exercises and desk
studies on responding to sudden large-scale disasters
on remote islands to maintain and enhance the SDF’s
ability to respond to disasters on remote islands as well
as strengthen collaboration with the U.S. Forces and
relevant disaster prevention organizations. This was the
first time the SDF conducted an exercise that deployed
units to Kozushima Island, Tokyo, using the GSDF’s
V-22 Osprey aircraft, as well as a rescue exercise that
used security dogs that had been certified as search and
rescue dogs.

[Drills for Medical Treatment Activities Following a
Large-Scale Earthquake]
The SDF participated in a drill organized by the Cabinet
Office involving medical treatment activities to be
carried out in the aftermath of a large-scale earthquake.
In this drill, the SDF rehearsed various actions for
disaster relief and coordination procedures with disaster
prevention organizations to maintain and reinforce its
disaster response capabilities.

[Training on the Transportation of Japanese Nationals
Overseas]
A training on the transportation of Japanese nationals
overseas was conducted in February 2023 for the
purposes of improving the joint operational capabilities
for the transportation of Japanese nationals overseas and
strengthening cooperation with related organizations.
By drawing on the experience of missions involving
the transportation of Japanese nationals overseas in


-----

Afghanistan, the training covered a series of activities
ranging from preparation for deployment in Japan to
deployment to overseas destinations using actual personnel
and equipment in cooperation with related organizations.

[Joint Deployment and Action Training (Middle East and
Africa), Furnace Darter (FD)]
A joint deployment and action training was conducted
in December 2022 for the purposes of training the
Deployed Joint Task Force in actions ranging from
post-deployment to the protection and transportation
of Japanese nationals overseas and strengthening
cooperation between the SDF, related organizations, the
U.S. Forces, etc. This training was conducted in an actual
operating environment in the Middle East/Africa and
focused on the actions of the units after their deployment
outside Japan by utilizing the SDF’s overseas activity
base in Djibouti.

**(2) Training of Each SDF Service**
A high-level of training by each SDF is a fundamental
prerequisite for being able to fully exert joint defense
capabilities. As such, each SDF continuously conducts
individual training for its troops and organizational training
for its units, forming the foundation of a strong SDF.
a. GSDF
The GSDF conducts maneuver and deployment training
in which rapid deployment divisions and brigades are
mobilized nationwide and field training exercises at the
regional army level to improve its response capabilities
for various contingencies and other situations.
In addition, it conducts parachute drop training from

b. MSDF
The Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) uses a
training system that enhances proficiency in stages,
as a specific period that takes account of the timing of
crewmember rotations and naval vessel inspections and
repairs is determined as the cycle, which is then divided
into multiple stages. Under this system, the MSDF
conducts trainings in which vessels coordinate with each
other and with aircraft, as well as maritime field training
exercises in which units all over Japan are mobilized,
as part of efforts to enhance responsiveness. In addition,
the MSDF conducts mine warfare training in Japan and

**(2) Japan-U.S. Bilateral Exercises of Each SDF Service**
a. GSDF
In recent years, the GSDF has strengthened its operational
and strategic coordination with the U.S. Army and U.S.
Marines both centrally and at the Pacific level. Bilateral
exercises, in conjunction with high-level exchanges,
have continued to evolve and develop as part of ongoing
efforts to fundamentally strengthen the Japan-U.S. joint
response posture.
In FY2022, the results of individual bilateral/
multilateral training exercises conducted were built upon
and further refined through coordination. In particular,
the results of Orient Shield 2022 conducted with the U.S.
Army and those of Resolute Dragon 2022 conducted with
the U.S. Marines were significantly developed through
their synergy with the Japan-U.S. bilateral regional army
command post exercise “YS-83.”


**2 Training that Contributes to**
**Strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance**

The Japan-U.S. Alliance is essential to Japan’s
national security, and Japan-U.S. bilateral exercises
play a significant role in enhancing Japan’s deterrence
and response capabilities. The SDF has consistently
conducted joint training involving different SDF


-----

[Orient Shield 2022]
The GSDF conducted a training aimed at reinforcing
Japan-U.S. coordination capabilities in light of its crossdomain operations and the U.S. Army’s multi-domain
operations. This training involved the deployment
throughout Kyushu of both Japan and the United States’
missile units and electronic warfare units that collect
information through the electromagnetic spectrum,
including the deployment of the U.S. Army’s High
Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) unit on
the Amami-Oshima Island for the first time, as part of
the cross-domain anti-ship combat training that was
conducted by combining combat means across multiple
domains. A simulation exercise involving Japan-U.S.
joint targeting was conducted through integration with
these sites. A new unit, the Multi-Domain Task Force,
participated in the exercise from the U.S. mainland for
the first time. The training also encompassed combat
support such as logistics and medical services to further
develop the coordination between the various services of
the armed forces of Japan and the United States.

troops and supplies to the Nansei Islands by Japanese and U.S.
transport aircraft and Private Finance Initiative (PFI) vessels, as
well as the establishment of joint Japan-U.S. logistics bases on
Amami Oshima Island and in Okinawa. The SDF also rehearsed
Japan-U.S. coordination in various ground, marine, and air
operations to enhance the SDF’s joint operations and Japan- Japan-U.S. coordination on the launch of surface-to-ship missiles


-----

b. MSDF
The MSDF has traditionally conducted bilateral
exercises with the U.S. Navy proactively, and is working
to enhance the effectiveness of Japan-U.S. joint response
as well as cross-domain operation capabilities through
Japan-U.S. bilateral exercises with naval vessels and
aircraft, anti-submarine special exercises, minesweeping
special training, medical special training, and Japan-U.S.
medical bilateral training.
For example, the MSDF has consistently conducted
bilateral exercises with U.S. carrier strike groups to
further reinforce the deterrence and response capabilities
of the Japan-U.S. Alliance and demonstrate that the two
countries are acting in concert.
c. ASDF
The ASDF is working to reinforce the deterrence and
response capabilities of the Japan-U.S. Alliance through
bilateral exercises with the U.S. Air Force, such as “Red
Flag-Alaska,” the U.S. Air Force exercise that the ASDF
has been participating in since 1996, and the bilateral
exercise “Cope North,” which has been conducted in
Guam since 1999. In addition, the ASDF is working to
enhance the effectiveness of Japan-U.S. joint response as
well as cross-domain operation capabilities through air
combat training, intercept training, defensive counter air
training, tactical attack training, aerial refueling training,
search and rescue training, and navigation and formation
training with the U.S. Navy and Marines, as well as other
Japan-U.S. bilateral exercises.
For example, in 2022, the SDF and the U.S. Forces
conducted a bilateral exercise amid an increasingly
challenging security environment that included the
repeated launch of ballistic missiles, including ICBMclass ballistic missiles, by North Korea. This bilateral
exercise affirmed the readiness of the SDF and the
U.S. Forces under the robust Japan-U.S. Alliance,
demonstrated both domestically and internationally
the strong will and close cooperation between Japan
and the United States when responding to various
contingencies, and sought to further reinforce joint
operation capabilities. The SDF and the U.S. Forces will
continue to cooperate closely in peacetime to safeguard
the defense of Japan and the peace and stability of the
region while maintaining the necessary posture to swiftly
respond to various contingencies.


series of actions ranging from receiving the U.S. Marines
deployed on the islands to guiding them to combat
areas. The U.S. Marines also underwent their first soft
field landing training using transport aircraft mounted
with HIMARS at the Kenebetsu Takeoff and Landing
Site. At the same time, joint anti-ship combat training
was also conducted in view of the characteristics of
remote islands. Japan and the United States endeavor to
provide mutually complementary logistics and medical
support services to improve the sustainability of combat
operations on remote islands while limiting the damage
sustained.

[Japan-U.S. Bilateral Regional Army Command Post
Exercise (YS-83)]
The GSDF rehearsed coordination procedures involving
its cross-domain operations, the U.S. Army’s multidomain operations, and the U.S. Marines’ EABO. For
this training, the participating units were expanded
from one regional army to the Ground Component
Command and two regional armies. In addition to
these two regional armies, the Ground Component
Command (which commands overall combat operations,
including units under its direct chain of command, such
as the 1st Airborne Brigade and the Amphibious Rapid
Deployment Brigade, as well as cooperating MSDF and
ASDF units) and the U.S. I Corps (the counterpart in this
exercise) served as the headquarters for Japan’s and the
United States’ joint task forces, respectively. By having
the two GSDF regional armies and the U.S. Army and
Marines conduct operations in their respective areas of
responsibility, the training integrated various operations
for which the joint task forces and individual units were
responsible.
The exercise successfully strengthened the
coordination between the various services of the
armed forces of Japan and the United States through
the dramatic development of the interoperability of
the two countries. Besides involving the naval and air
forces of Japan and the United States, this exercise
also successfully enhanced integration and multilateral
participation with the visit of the Commanding General
of the Philippine Army and the Commandant of the
Philippine Marine Corps, in addition to around 30
observers from the Australian armed forces. The highlevel exchanges conducted during the exercise enabled
participants to establish a common view on the future
evolution of bilateral/multilateral exercises and further
strengthen cooperation with other countries

**Initiatives for Safety Management, etc.**
**2**


The Ministry of Defense (MOD)/SDF constantly strive
as one for safety management, such as by implementing
the highest level of safety measures and precautions
during routine training.
In January 2022, an F-15 fighter aircraft from the
JASDF Komatsu Air Base (Ishikawa Prefecture) crashed
into the Sea of Japan shortly after takeoff from Komatsu
Air Base for night flight training, resulting in the death
of two personnel. In June 2022, an investigation into
the accident found that one of the main causes of the
crash was the possibility that the pilot had suffered from
spatial disorientation (in which one’s spatial awareness
differs from physical space in reality). In addition, it was
also deemed possible that the pilot might have been so
focused on radar operations that he was unaware of the
aircraft’s orientation until moments before the crash.
In light of this accident, robust efforts will be taken to
prevent its recurrence by strengthening education and
training related to spatial disorientation while enhancing
flight safety through physical means, including the timely
and appropriate installation of alarms and other safety
devices that serve to alert pilots to any abnormalities in


the aircraft’s orientation.
In April 2023, a UH-60JA helicopter (with 10 crew
members) from the JGSDF Vice-Camp Takayubaru
(Kumamoto Prefecture) was involved in an accident
in which it disappeared from radar when flying over
the ocean north-northwest of Miyakojima Island,
Okinawa, during an aerial reconnaissance. A search is
being conducted for the crew and the helicopter, and an
investigation into the cause of the accident is underway.
Any accident that may cause injury to Japanese
nationals, damage their property, or lead to the loss of
life of SDF personnel, must be prevented at all costs.
After thoroughly investigating the causes of these
accidents, the MOD/SDF will ensure that each and every
member of SDF personnel is reminded of the latest
safety management guidelines. At the same time, the
MOD/SDF as a whole will make every effort to ensure
safety in the operation of vessels, aircraft, vehicles, etc.,
through conducting safety education for SDF personnel
and the steady maintenance of equipment, etc., so as to
ensure that public confidence is not undermined.

For example, this is a method in which grouping of products, etc., takes place when the order is put up for general competitive bidding before a successful bidder is determined for each group.

This means that out of the bidding participation eligibility categorized into grade A-D, there is competition between grade C or D only, which comprise mostly small and medium enterprises.

and stable utilization by ensuring harmony between
the defense facilities and the surrounding areas and by
obtaining the understanding and cooperation of local
residents.
For that purpose, the MOD has taken measures to
prevent, reduce or mitigate aircraft noise and other
impacts caused by activities of the SDF or the USFJ, or
by the existence/operations of airfields and other defense
facilities in the surrounding areas since 1974 based
on the Act on Improvement of Living Environment of
Areas Around Defense Facilities (Living Environment
Improvement Act), etc.
In addition, in order to relieve the impact caused by the
existence and operation of defense facilities, subsidies are
provided for the development of facilities for stabilizing
the everyday lives of residents while Specified Defense
Facilities Environment Improvement Adjustment Grants
are given to municipalities around defense facilities
that have particularly significant impact on the living
environment. Specified Defense Facilities Environment
Improvement Adjustment Grants are utilized not only
for the development of facilities but also for so-called
“soft projects” such as aid for medical expenses.
In 2023, in order to respond with greater precision
to the operational modes of specified defense facilities
and their impact on surrounding areas the criteria


**1 Features of Defense Facilities and**
**Projects Related to Harmony with the**
**Surrounding Areas**

**(1) Measures around Defense Facilities**
Defense facilities are diverse in their use, and often
require large volumes of land. In addition, as of January
1, 2023, approximately 29% of the land area and 30
of the 76 facilities and areas (for exclusive use) of the
USFJ are jointly used by the SDF in accordance with the
Japan-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement, with the purpose
of enhancing the diversity and efficiency of Japan-U.S.
bilateral training and exercises. Meanwhile, problems
related to restricted establishment and operations of
defense facilities have emerged due to the urbanization
of areas around many of the defense facilities. Also,
another problem is that frequent aircraft operations such
as takeoffs and landings cause noise and other issues,
impacting the living environment of local residential
communities.
With that being said, defense facilities, as the
foundation that supports the defense capabilities of
Japan and the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, are
indispensable for Japan’s national security. Therefore, in
order for the facilities to exert their full function, it is
necessary to maintain the conditions for their constant

**(2) Grants, etc., to Promote the USFJ Realignment**
Over the course of a period of time before and after
the implementation of USFJ realignment[5] (10 years in
principle), realignment grants[6] are provided to help cover
the expenses of projects[7] that contribute to improving the
quality of life of residents in local municipalities affected
by the realignment and stimulate local industries. These
grants are provided in accordance with the progress of the
realignment after the Minister of Defense has designated
the specified defense facilities and neighboring
municipalities affected by the realignment.
As of April 2023, 12 municipalities affected by eight
defense facilities are eligible to receive the realignment
grants. In order to promote the realignment, additional
measures are taken with budgetary provision.

the measures to harmonize defense facilities and
surrounding areas should be in an attempt to make them
more suitable, effective and efficient, in consideration of
the severe fiscal situation.

**2 Efforts to Develop Understanding and**
**Cooperation Concerning the Stationing**
**of the USFJ**

Amid the increasingly severe security environment
surrounding Japan, maintaining the presence of the
USFJ and its readiness is vitally important for ensuring
the security of Japan. For stable stationing of the USFJ, it
is essential to obtain the understanding and cooperation
of local governments and residents in the vicinity of
defense facilities. Various efforts will continue to be
undertaken tirelessly in this regard.

located (“Base Subsidy”), and the Adjustment Grants
for municipalities where defense facilities are located
(“Adjustment Grants”), both of which are under the
defense facilities-related subsidy system under the
jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and
Communications.
The Base Subsidy was established in view of the fact
that the facilities used by the U.S. Forces and the SDF
such as airports have a significant impact on the finances
of municipalities. The subsidy generally takes the form
of a substitute for fixed property tax and is granted to
municipalities where these facilities are located.
The Adjustment Grants are provided to municipalities
where USFJ properties are located in view of the fact
that such properties are exempt from fixed property tax,
and U.S. military personnel and civilian employees are
exempt from municipal tax etc


**(1) Coordination with Local Governments, etc., for**
**Unit Operations of the USFJ**

The MOD is working to promote understanding
among local communities regarding the maintenance
of USFJ facilities and unit operations by providing
prior explanation to the relevant local governments and
residents in the event of any USFJ realignment, training,
unit deployment, new equipment deployment, etc.

**(2) Ensuring Safety during USFJ Operations**
Ensuring the safety of local residents is of prime
importance in USFJ operations. The Government has
been fully communicating its approach to the U S side


-----

including at summit and ministerial levels, with the two
countries cooperating to ensure safe operations as a
top priority.
In the event of a crash or missing parts, etc., of a U.S.
military aircraft, the MOD requests the United States
to promptly provide information and adopt rigorous
measures for safety management and recurrence
prevention. The MOD then promptly explains the
obtained information to the relevant local governments,
etc., and adopts measures to ensure prompt and
appropriate compensation for the damage incurred.
In addition, Japan and the United States have
established guidelines[8] for aircraft accidents and will
take prompt and appropriate action in response to the
situation in the scenario of a crash of a U.S. military
aircraft outside of the facilities/areas of the U.S. Forces
within Japan.
In addition, with regard to accidents/incidents
caused by the consumption of alcohol by U.S. military
personnel, etc., the MOD has requested the U.S. side
on multiple occasions to tighten discipline and conduct
personnel education.


The U.S. side, for its part, has taken measures such
as putting in its place guidelines for off-duty activities
(liberty policy), including imposing restrictions on the
consumption of alcohol at night as well as curfews for
U.S. military personnel under the age of 19. Japan and
the United States will continue to cooperate to prevent
the recurrence of incidents related to drinking.

**(3) Promoting Exchange between the USFJ and**
**Local Residents**

The MOD holds a Japan-U.S. exchange program to
deepen mutual understanding between Japan and the
United States with the understanding and cooperation
of the local governments and U.S. Forces. Under the
program, residents living near USFJ facilities and areas
together with USFJ personnel enjoy sports, music and
cultural exchanges.
The USFJ also has initiatives to deepen mutual
understanding with people of the local communities,
which include opening up of its bases (Friendship
day) and information provision through websites and
social media.

The SDF presents ceremonies including guards of honor,
lining up and gun salutes to the Emperor, state guests
and others at national events. A guard of honor to state
guests from foreign countries at their welcome reception
is essential for diplomatic protocol.
On September 27, 2022, approximately 1,390 SDF
personnel participated in the state funeral of former
Prime Minister ABE Shinzo to perform guard of honor,
line-up, funeral salutes, and music.

The SDF has been providing transportation for personnel
and supplies and other cooperation for the scientific
research in Antarctica conducted by the Ministry of


Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology
(MEXT) since 1965, when Antarctic research was
resumed, with the icebreaker JS Fuji, since 1983 with


-----

icebreaker JS Shirase, and since 2009 with the secondgeneration icebreaker JS Shirase.
For the 64th Antarctic Research Expedition from
November 2022 to April 2023, the SDF provided


support for the transportation of a total of 142 people and
approximately 1,120 tons of supplies, support for sea
and land observations, and support for base construction.

**1 Response to Laser Irradiation and Kite**
**Flying towards SDF and U.S. Forces**
**Aircraft**

There have been cases of SDF and U.S. Forces aircraft
being interfered by laser irradiation and kite flying
during flight operations. These extremely dangerous and
malicious acts could disrupt a pilot’s ability to operate
the aircraft, which could result in a catastrophe, such
as plane crash. Therefore, the MOD works closely with
relevant local governments to disseminate information
to local residents regarding the risks involved in these
acts by putting up posters and requesting to report to the
police. Additionally, the Ordinance for Enforcement of
the Civil Aeronautics Act was revised in December 2016,
making these interference acts subject to regulation as
well as fines and other penalties.


In recent years there have been terror small drones,
including commercial drones, some of which are
targeted at military facilities. Given such circumstances,
there is a possibility of drone terror attacks in Japan on
SDF/USFJ facilities and areas, which if attacked, would
seriously affect the function of the national security
defense foundation. To address such concerns, the Act
on Prohibition of Flight of UASs around and over Key
Facilities (commonly known as the “Drone Act”) came
into effect on June 13, 2019, to prohibit small drones
from flying over and around SDF/USFJ facilities and
areas designated by the Minister of Defense. As of the
end of March 2023, 260 SDF facilities, including areas
of SDF Headquarters and 45 USFJ facilities and areas
have been designated as No Drone Zone.

Act on the Review and Regulation of the Use of Real
Estate Surrounding Important Facilities and on Remote
Territorial Islands (so-called “Important Real Estate
Review Act”) was drafted based on the recommendations
of the Advisory Panel. The Act was promulgated on June
23, 2021, and came into effect on September 20, 2022.
A Basic Policy to prevent the use of real estate
that impedes the functions of important facilities and
remote territorial islands was approved by the Cabinet
in September 2022, and the first area designation was
publicly announced in December 2022. The areas
surrounding some defense-related facilities have been
designated as “monitored areas” and “special monitored
areas.”
This Act has major significance from the perspective of
ensuring that defense-related facilities, which constitute
the foundation of Japan’s national defense, are able to
function properly. The MOD will adopt the appropriate
measures in this regard in cooperation with the Cabinet
Office.


**3 Response to the Act on Review and**
**Regulation of Real Estate Usage**

In line with the previous iteration of the NSS formulated
in December 2013, which called for Japan to review
issues related to the use of land in areas such as the areas
surrounding defense facilities from the standpoint of
national security, the MOD has been conducting research
since FY2013 to ensure a systematic understanding of
the situation of land ownership in areas surrounding
defense facilities.
In July 2020, the Basic Policies on Economic and
Fiscal Management and Reform 2020 (so-called “Basic
Policies 2020”; approved by the Cabinet on July 17,
2020) called for the Government to ascertain the status
of land ownership through information gathering by the
relevant ministries and agencies from the standpoint
of national security, examine the approach to land use
and management, and adopt the necessary measures.

previous fiscal year due to further spikes in the price of
electricity as a result of the tight supply and demand of
electricity and the rising prices of LNG and crude oil due
to the fallout from Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.
However, as a member of the Government, the MOD
will continue to make efforts to increase the ratio of
renewable energy electricity.

See Fig. IV-4-2-1 (FY2023 List of Facilities That Have Introduced

Renewable Energy (Top 10 Facilities by Estimated Energy
Consumption on a Contract Basis))

**3 Balancing Renewable Energy Electricity**
**and Security**


As the largest consumer of electricity among government
institutions (accounting for approximately 40% of the
total government consumption), the MOD/SDF, which
has approximately 250,000 SDF personnel and operates
facilities and various equipment all around Japan,
has actively promoted the procurement of electricity
generated by renewable energy sources (hereinafter
“renewable energy electricity”) for MOD/SDF facilities
since FY2020 in order to contribute to the reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions and other goals.
In FY2023, the MOD held 969 contracts related to
the procurement of electricity for its facilities, etc.,
nationwide, of which 50 facilities, etc., procured
renewable energy electricity. Furthermore, 36 facilities,
etc., procured 100% of their electricity from renewable
energy sources. The amount of renewable energy
electricity procured in FY2023 is expected to be around
90 million kWh (annual electricity consumption of
more than 20,000 general households). This means that
approximately 7% of all electricity expected to be used
by the MOD/SDF in FY2023 (approximately 1.29 billion
kWh) will be procured in the form of renewable energy
electricity. The amount of renewable energy electricity


The introduction of renewable sources of energy,
including wind power, is being promoted in response to
the issue of climate change, and wind power generation
facilities are expected to increase. Depending on the
location and height of these wind power generation
facilities, they may potentially impact the activities of
the SDF and U.S. Forces in Japan by blocking radio
waves emitted by warning and control radars and making
it difficult to detect aircraft and missiles, etc. Because of
this potential impact, the MOD/SDF coordinates with
project operators and other related parties meticulously
from the early stages of project planning.
Furthermore, the NDS stipulates the need for Japan to
establish an effective mechanism to balance its defense
requirements with socioeconomic activities such as the
installation of wind power generation facilities so that


procured in FY2023 declined significantly from the its defense-related facilities can function fully through

unimpeded utilization of sea, airspace, and radio wave.
In line with this, the MOD will continue to promote
measures to balance renewable energy electricity with
Japan’s national security while avoiding any adverse
impact on the activities of the SDF/USFJ due to the
installation of wind power generation facilities.

and disposal of PFOS, which it aims to complete by the
end of FY2023.
In addition, the analysis results of water in the
dedicated tanks of SDF facilities nationwide where
aqueous film-forming foam containing PFOS was or
may have been used in the past were made public in July
2022. Following this investigation, the water in tanks in
which PFOS, etc., has been detected will continue to be

USFJ has been briefed on the completion of the
replacement of aqueous film-forming foam at all U.S.
Army facilities in Honshu as well as at all U.S. Navy
and U.S. Marines facilities in Japan. USFJ as a whole is
progressively replacing the aqueous film-forming foam
in its possession.
In addition, the Government, together with the
relevant local governments and in accordance with the
Supplementary Agreement on Cooperation in the Field
of Environmental Stewardship, entered the respective
facilities at U.S. Fleet Activities, Yokosuka, during
a leakage of wastewater containing PFOS and other
substances in May 2022 and at Atsugi Air Base during a
leakage of water containing aqueous film-forming foam
in September 2022. The MOD will continue to cooperate
closely with the relevant ministries and agencies, related
local governments, and the U.S. side, and take necessary
measures.


In USFJ facilities and areas, efforts are made to save
utilities, which include changes to energy-efficient
heating/ventilation/air-conditioning equipment; installation
of motion sensors for lights-out during absence;
installation of solar panels; reduction of the period to
use cooling/ heating equipment and review of the preset
temperature; and control of lighting and lights-out for
night lighting, for example.

**Chapter**


Democracy, which is the most important system of
the country, is founded on the principle that the public
has access to accurate information, thereby making
appropriate judgment and exercise of sovereignty.
Administrative documents held by the government
are of the utmost importance for the public’s access to
accurate information. For this reason it is an important
responsibility for the government, including the MOD/
SDF, to manage information in an appropriate manner
and appropriately respond to the public’s disclosure
requests for administrative documents.


The MOD/SDF takes it seriously that the issues over
daily reports in South Sudan and Iraq brought about the
public’s distrust in the MOD/SDF.
The MOD/SDF is making full effort to prevent
recurrence in line with the “Measures for Ensuring
Appropriate Management of Public Records” (Adopted
by the Ministerial Council on the Management of
Administrative Documents and Related Matters on July
20, 2018), which compiles the measures necessary for
proper management of public records and archives by
the entire government. The MOD/SDF is also working
for proper management and responding to disclosure
requests for administrative documents by reforming the
awareness of personnel and the organizational culture,
the checking framework, for example.

Documents by the Ministry of Defense [FY2022])

**Protection System**

In light of respecting individual rights and interests
in line with the Act on the Protection of Personal
Information, the MOD takes measures to manage the
security of personal information under its control and
responds appropriately to requests for the disclosure of
such information.


**4 Appropriate Operation of the**
**Whistleblower Protection System**

The MOD sets up a system to handle whistleblowing
made by its officials, employees and outside workers,
