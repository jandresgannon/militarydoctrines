## 1. Introduction


This document has three core aims: to describe the security environment as of early
2023; to outline Estonia’s objectives in light of the deterioration of the security environment; and to describe the steps that need to be taken in order to achieve the
objectives that have been set. It is a framework document serving as a guideline for
sector-specific strategies and development plans.

The 2023 edition of the National Security Concept is the fifth Estonian National
Security Concept. It draws on the previous concept, devised in 2017.

The National Security Concept is drafted by the government and approved by the
Riigikogu (Estonian parliament). The document is updated at least once every four
years or in response to changes in the security environment or in Estonia’s ability to
ensure its security.

## 2. Principles of Estonian security policy


The aim of Estonia’s security policy is to guarantee the sovereignty and independence
of the Republic of Estonia, the preservation of the Estonian people, language and culture, its territorial integrity, constitutional order, safety of the population and the functioning of society.

The foundation of Estonia’s security is a social order that centres on respect for human
dignity, the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals, democratic governance
and the rule of law. Estonia is a member of a community of democratic countries, and
Estonia’s aim is that this community is united and enduring. Estonia’s security is underpinned by a system of international relations based on respect for international law.

Estonian security policy is guided by the principles set out in the charter of the United
Nations (UN) and by the right and freedom of every nation to choose its own security
solutions. The safeguarding of Estonia’s security is not directed against any other state.

Estonia will defend itself in any event and against any threat, regardless of its origin
or the time and place in which it emerges, and however overwhelming the adversary;
Estonia will never surrender. Estonia’s aim is to render any aggression against the
Estonian state unfeasible.

Security is all-encompassing. Estonia’s security policy is based on a broad security
concept, which includes all trends and factors affecting national security. The implementation of Estonia’s security policy is based on a holistic approach to society and
the state.

Estonia’s security begins with ourselves, including with the readiness and actions of
every individual. Based on Estonia’s comprehensive national defence concept, the
defence of the nation and preparations for it draw on all available military and non-military capabilities and resources, involving also the public, private and third sector.

Estonia’s security is underpinned by its membership in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU) and by close cooperation with
allies and other international partners. Estonia considers the security of itself and its
allies to be indivisible.


-----

Due to the significant deterioration in the international security environment, Estonia
as a whole must make efforts to reinforce its security at a greater scale and speed.
For a safer and more crises-proof environment, security issues must be factored into
the development of laws, policies, working processes, supply chains, infrastructure,
international cooperation and more.

Ensuring security and crisis preparedness for the state and society is a comprehensive, continuous and purposeful process. It must be reflected in the mindset, readiness, actions and cooperation of constitutional institutions, the executive, local
governments, businesses, organisations, communities and individuals. The state
promotes and supports volunteer activity in boosting crisis preparedness and crisis
management.

In preparing for and dealing with crises, Estonia is guided by the principle of the continuity of duties: everyone fulfils their role both under ordinary circumstances as well
as at times of crisis and war. By preparing for war and the most serious crises, we are
also prepared to deal with crises of lesser impact.

The basis of Estonian security is a cohesive and united society. In Estonia, human and
civil rights are protected. Estonia ensures that all people have equal opportunities and
a living environment in which they are cared for, live long lives and are as healthy as
possible, in which inequality and poverty are reduced and people enjoy working lives
of notable length and quality. Estonia’s economic environment is attractive. Education,
research and development form the basis of a successful and future-oriented Estonia.


-----

## 3. Security environment


The greatest strategic challenge in the current security environment is an increasing
confrontation between various political, economic and social systems. The sphere of
values based on democracy, market economy, rule of law and human rights is under
pressure, ideological opposition to it is growing. Authoritarian regimes have grown
more aggressive and are increasingly collaborating to undermine democratic values.

Veiled competition has turned into an open confrontation, with war once again being waged
in Europe. A new international security architecture is being shaped through this confrontation. For Estonia, the survival of the world order based on rules and democratic
values is of existential importance.

The greatest security threat to Estonia is the Russian Federation, whose objective is
to dismantle and rewrite Europe’s security architecture and the rules-based international order, and to restore the politics of spheres of influence. The threat to Estonia
based on these objectives is an existential one. The Russian Federation has repeatedly carried out acts of aggression, occupying, annexing, and committing war crimes
on the territory of neighbouring countries. The threat the Russian Federation poses to
Estonia is a long-term one.

The military threat to NATO, including to Estonia and the Baltic states as members of
the Alliance, has increased over the last year. The aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine shows that it is willing to take risks, therefore we must also be
prepared for miscalculations on its part. The Russian Federation is increasingly using
military means, including nuclear threats, to achieve its political objectives.

The military threat to the Baltic states and NATO is further increased by the expanding influence and military presence of the Russian Federation in Belarus. The growing
influence of the Russian Federation and further attempts to increase it in the Balkans,
Moldova and Georgia compounds the threat that it poses to security and stability.
The strategic importance of Africa and the Arctic has also increased for the Russian
Federation.

The Russian Federation makes continuous use of hybrid attacks to achieve its political objectives. These attacks are designed to influence political and social choices
in a way that is favourable to the Russian Federation and to undermine trust and
unity both within and between countries. Asymmetric means, such as information


-----

influence activities, energy dependency, engineered migration or destabilising activities in cyberspace, are systematically and simultaneously employed to achieve the
desired effect. Herein, cyberspace is both an independent domain and an enabler of
other domains, and the accompanying risks must not be underestimated. Orchestrating hybrid attacks is a task of the Russian Federation’s intelligence and security
services. A hybrid attack could lead to the triggering of NATO’s Article 5.

The Russian Federation actively conducts information influence activities against
Estonia and the rest of democratic nations. Attitudes shaped by the long-term impact
of the Russian information sphere are a threat to the constitutional order of Estonia.
The Russian Federation employs a variety of social groups, including the pro-Russian
population, to amplify polarising issues in society and divide Estonian society.

Neither the existing security system nor international law have sufficiently deterred or
prevented the aggression of the Russian Federation nor its use of asymmetric means
against its neighbouring countries. Such tendency becoming the norm represents a
threat to security and undermines the international order. The war against Ukraine and
the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation are evidence of this and demand
an unequivocal response from the democratic world.

The democratic nations’ response to the Russian Federation’s full-scale war against
Ukraine has been robust, underscoring the importance of unity and determination in
shaping the security environment. Solidarity within the European Union, strong transatlantic relations, and the prioritisation of collective defence in NATO are at the heart
of condemning the aggression of the Russian Federation, imposing sanctions, and
supporting Ukraine. Estonia’s influence on the international arena has grown, inter alia
as a vocal advocate of helping Ukraine.

The clout and influence of the People’s Republic of China have grown on the international arena. The main challenge to Estonia’s security arising from the People’s
Republic of China is its aim to reshape the norms of international engagement and its
wish to influence decisions and achieve control of strategic domains. China employs
asymmetric means to this end.

Intensifying confrontation on the international arena is also evident in economic,
industrial and technological spheres. Countries that do not share democratic values
and companies acting in their interests are becoming a threat via weaponizing connectivity and the model of open governance. Malevolent actors could utilise Estonia’s
digital services for money laundering, financing terrorism or other unlawful activities.

Other strategic challenges include climate change, migratory pressure, food security,
pandemics, terrorism, extremism, energy security and risks to the global economy,
all of which have a direct or indirect impact on national and international security. As
a member of both the European Union and NATO, Estonia may become a target for


-----

terrorist organisations and adherents of their ideology. There are no good solutions to
these challenges within national borders, but increasing rivalry and political polarisation are making it more difficult to solve them through international cooperation. The
fight for vital resources – drinking water, food, arable land and energy – is increasing
the threat of global instability, conflicts and mass migration. Climate change, in turn,
is accelerating the likelihood of these threats materialising.

## 4. Areas of activity in Estonia’s security policy

Estonia is facing the most tense security situation of the reindependence period. As a
society and a nation, we must be prepared for risks that previously seemed unthinkable.

To strengthen our security, Estonia acts within five main domains, which are interlinked and mutually supportive, and which together form a whole where each part is
of equal value:

###  social cohesion and resilience of the state

  economic security and critical services

  internal security and public order

  military defence

  international cooperation

In a deteriorating security situation, we must improve the resilience of the entire state
and its population. To achieve this, it is necessary to ensure targeted long-term development of non-military national defence capabilities through permanent funding in
the state budget strategy.

Due to the increased military threat of the Russian Federation, the required Estonian
military defence spending is at least 3% of GDP; Estonia’s host nation support costs
will come on top of it. Similarly to military defence spending, the state budget strategy will ensure permanent funding for the development of civil protection, taking into
account investment needs based on threat scenarios.


-----

###  4.1. Social cohesion and resilience of the state

Estonia is a society with a shared identity and shared values whose cohesion stems
from its language, culture, democratic norms and values. Estonia has a vibrant population and cultural space.

In a cohesive society, all fundamental rights and freedoms are protected. There is less
conflict and dissatisfaction in such a society, as well as fewer vulnerable people and risk
groups, and less radicalisation. Maintaining and increasing social cohesion in Estonia
requires a constant focus on issues that divide society, on reducing their impact and eliminating their causes. Opportunities must be created for everyone to thrive on their own.

To prevent the population from being influenced in a way that leads to conflicts threatening the constitutional order, information influence activities, including disinformation, must be promptly identified and stopped from spreading. To this end, Estonia
uses strategic communication to ensure that constitutional values are embraced as
widely as possible in society.

Estonia is increasing its population’s ability to adapt and cope in a complex, high-risk
environment. Learning skills that contribute to positive mental health and self-efficacy begins in childhood and it is available to all ages and socioeconomic groups.

For the preservation of the Estonian state and people, particular attention should be
paid to children and their protection. Arrangements should be in place for providing
education, childcare and other services, and ensuring child safety in times of crisis.

Estonia’s demographic situation may become a security risk if the population declines
and ages. Global demographic trends are moving in the opposite direction, and potential negative changes in the living environment, economic downturn, radicalisation, conflicts and crises may cause an increase in migration that affects Estonia.

Estonia will continue to reinforce the crisis preparedness of its social and healthcare
systems according to threats and in line with the lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic,
with a particular focus on the crisis preparedness of health infrastructure and social
infrastructure. The continued provision of healthcare, social services and emergency
social care services in the required volume will ensure the society is able to cope in
crises and at a time of war.

Estonia values open and inclusive governance. One of the aims of this is to boost the
level of trust in the state among residents. Trust, a strong civil society, risk awareness,
defence resolve, and the readiness to volunteer for the resolution of crises all enhance
social resilience.


-----

Estonia enhances resilience in a comprehensive and coordinated manner. To improve
the preparedness of constitutional institutions, the executive and local governments
and the continuity of critical services Estonia must have a national risk assessment,
coordinated management and planning, up-to-date crisis plans and regular exercises at every level. The main prerequisites for implementing plans are cooperation
between the different parties, the resilience of each individual part, and the necessary
resources.

###  4.2. Economic security and critical services

Estonia’s economic success and security depend on fair and open trade, a transparent
rules-based international economic environment, solid national finances, trusted connectivity in both the physical and digital world, emerging technologies, supply chains
and access to resources.

In terms of economic security, Estonia’s aim is to prevent and exclude dependence on
authoritarian states, and unreliable companies under their control, including by boosting the effectiveness of supervision. In parallel, Estonia is developing innovative technological solutions that could be offered to democracies, including for increasing the
value of the mineral resources of the future, which are needed for energy production
and completing the green transition. Estonia ensures secure supply chains and the
transparency of foreign investments in strategic areas. In addition, Estonia assesses
the risks involved in public procurements to exclude products, services and tenderers
that could pose a risk to critical services.

Energy security is the cornerstone of security and economic activity. Estonia’s aim is
to achieve and maintain complete energy independence from the Russian Federation
and to diversify its energy mix. To reduce risks to the security of supply of electricity,
controlled generation capacity will be ensured to the necessary extent. Estonia, along
with Latvia and Lithuania, is in the process of reinforcing its electricity systems, and
once completed, the Baltic states will be able to desynchronize from the Russian-Belarusian grid and connect to the electricity system of continental Europe.

Estonia’s economic model must be sustainable, competitive and future-proof. To
this end, we are increasing the proportion of renewable energy in our energy mix and
implementing a strategically managed green transition in the country. Estonia’s goal
is to have its renewable electricity production equal its total annual consumption by
2030.

The basis of a functioning resilient society and crisis preparedness is ensuring the
continuity of critical services, which includes being prepared for the most difficult
scenarios, including war. In case of a crisis or war, Estonia will ensure the functioning


-----

of the state’s finance system and state cash flow.

All levels of society must have stocks to ensure crisis readiness. To keep the society
functioning in a crisis, Estonia keeps sufficient national stocks of fuel and natural gas,
in accordance with risk scenarios, as well as reserves of food and medicinal products
supplied through pharmacies. To boost security of supply and ensure flexibility of
response, we are developing a network-based model for the cooperation of the public
and private sector.

Estonia’s security and economic success depend on the sustainable development of
its digital society. When it comes to digital transformation and technological choices,
the state and the private sector must be mindful of the security environment and
global trends in technology. In digital space, we must plan for cybersecurity and information security in all information systems, organisations and processes.

Estonia supports the leading role of democratic countries in developing new and
emerging technologies. It is in Estonia’s security interests to support national companies operating in these strategic areas.

###  4.3. Internal security and public order

Estonia staunchly defends its constitutional order and internal peace. An open,
humane and effective way of guaranteeing public order and security increases public
trust in government.

Estonia acts decisively to prevent and counter the actions of hostile special services
and non-state actors. In line with the principles of the rule of law and as a deterrent to
the Russian Federation, information concerning activities directed against the state is
made public if possible.

Estonia prevents and combats corruption, radicalisation, violent extremism, terrorism
and its financing, money laundering and organised crime. Prevention and rehabilitation of offenders, ensured through an effective penal policy and cooperation between
various stakeholders, is an important part of ensuring security.

Effective control of external borders, including customs and tax control, is vital in a
deteriorating security situation, as it helps to prevent illegal migration or migration
organised with a hostile purpose. Identifying dangerous persons and hazardous substances at the border increases security throughout the Schengen area. The state uses
all legal means to protect Estonia, the Schengen area, the European Union and NATO.

Given Estonia’s reliance on digital services, the state ensures the availability of public


-----

services and the integrity and confidentiality of data, including during crises.

Both under ordinary circumstances and in crises, experts in public order, internal security, border control, cybersecurity and strategic communication, as well as volunteers
supporting them, are among those who react to the first signs of danger to prevent
the situation from escalating into a threat to constitutional order. Maintaining and
developing this ability requires technologically advanced, scenario-based, and timely
capacity development that takes into account the creation of reserves, as well as
long-term and stable funding.

The deteriorating security environment requires an increase in the population’s crisis
resilience and a more systematic implementation of civil protection. The aim of civil
protection is to support people in a crisis, including in wartime, and to increase their
self-resilience in a crisis. Civil protection at a time of crisis means that both the state
and the society are prepared for early warning and alerts, rescue operations, evacuation, sheltering, first aid and disaster medicine, essential social assistance, psychosocial crisis assistance and other forms of essential assistance for the population.

The basis for civil protection is people’s ability to protect themselves during a crisis
until help arrives, and to assist each other if necessary. Achieving this requires a joint
effort of various parts of society, including individuals, communities, volunteers, local
government units, and various state institutions. Estonia develops social protection
measures to address threats to the population, along with risk communication and
training, including to enhance institutional capacity.

###  4.4. Military defence

The aim of military defence is to prevent military threats and, if necessary, to
successfully defend the country and win the war. In order to deter any potential adversary from launching a military aggression, Estonia adopts a forward defence posture,
which combines national military defence capability and collective defence. Estonia’s
national defence system is based on the principle of democratic civilian control.

To ensure credible deterrence, NATO must be prepared for an immediate collective
defence operation anywhere on Allied territory. NATO’s forward defence posture on
its Eastern Flank must be based on deterrence by denial – the aim of which is to
convince the aggressor that achieving its objectives through military means is impossible. Credible deterrence by denial consists of Estonia’s own strong military defence,
combat-ready Allied presence integrated with Estonian military defence, designated
reinforcement forces, effective command and control, prepositioned equipment,
high-quality defence plans that are regularly exercised, and the resolve and ability of
Allies to rapidly deploy additional forces, capabilities and equipment in case of a crisis.


-----

Estonia’s military defence is structured around the principle of territorial defence. Estonia is guided by the understanding that the Baltic states are one area of operations.

To strengthen Estonian military defence, we are developing, on the basis of military
advice and in an expedited manner, complete military units and capabilities that are
manned, armed, equipped, trained, regularly exercised and that have sufficient supplies. Based on both units in reserve and those at permanent readiness, Estonia is
developing manoeuvre units and territorial defence units capable of blocking and
countering the adversary.

Situational awareness, advanced early warning, capable intelligence, counterintelligence and a shared threat perception amongst Allies are key to ensuring efficient
national defence planning and pre-empt military threats. Early warning supports
timely decision-making and rapid implementation of decisions, which are of primary
importance not only to achieve defence readiness but also to prepare the state as a
whole for countering a threat.

Estonia must achieve defence readiness before a threat materialises. To that end,
freedom of action is ensured as early as possible for the Estonian Defence Forces
and Allied forces, including, if necessary, in the regional area of operations – the Baltic
states and the Baltic Sea. Regularly conducted defence readiness exercises, including at short notice, aim to make the mobilisation system more efficient.

Conscript service is the main instrument for building reserve units, maintaining combat readiness and providing a recruitment pool for active duty. Estonia’s defence
capability is enhanced by boosting the attractiveness of conscription and reserve service, and a greater participation of women. The Estonian Defence League contributes
to preparing the national defence capability and ensuring security.

The bedrock of Estonia’s defence is a strong defence resolve. Strengthening defence
resolve is a joint effort involving many sectors, and national defence education is
among its contributing elements. Estonia values the defenders of the state and the contributions to national defence by the citizens, the private sector and the general society.
To reinforce this, more opportunities for both a military and non-military contribution
to national defence are being created, while raising awareness of these opportunities.

The contribution of Allies to NATO’s defence in Estonia and in the Baltic states as well
as the militarily meaningful Allied presence are an important part of Estonian defence.
Allied military presence and activities in Estonia should be continuous and planned.
Those forces must be fully equipped, supplied and capable of operating together with
the Estonian units.

To strengthen the security of all Allies, Estonia takes part in collective defence
operations and other international military operations. These operations reinforce


-----

international security. Moreover, participating in them contributes to developing relations and interoperability between Allies, and provides the Estonian Defence Forces
with valuable experience.

###   4.5. International cooperation

Active involvement in international organisations, dynamic regional cooperation and
close and effective bilateral relations with Allies and partners form the cornerstone
of Estonia’s foreign policy. This applies to Europe as a whole, the wider transatlantic
community and the global context but, more narrowly, also to the Baltic Sea region.
Mutual solidarity between countries and the unity of their positions are important in
achieving goals and make the implementation of decisions more efficient. Estonia’s
foreign policy is active, constructive and confident. It focuses on issues threatening
the survival of the Estonian state and society, as well as those that strengthen Estonia’s statehood and society and make them more resilient.

At the heart of Estonia’s foreign and security policy are NATO and the European Union,
through which Members States ensure their common and national interests. The
purposefulness, strength and unity of NATO and the European Union are of utmost
importance. Estonia supports close, result-oriented cooperation between NATO and
the European Union. In maintaining and developing relations with the Union and Allies,
Estonia aspires to be at the core of decision making, fulfilling its obligations and contributing to security in different parts of the world to this end.

In the crises that have occurred over the last five years – the migration crisis, the
COVID pandemic and Russia’s aggression against Ukraine – the European Union has
consolidated and targeted its actions more effectively. The Union’s strength lies in the
solidarity of its Member States, which is manifested, among other things, in coping
with the current crises. The European Union’s consensus-based decision-making process for foreign policy is in the interests of the Union itself and of all of its Member
States and ensures the implementation of decisions.

The core task of NATO – credible collective defence – is ensured by the strengthened
deterrence and defence posture agreed by the Alliance; increased defence spending
and investments by all Allies; swift political and military decision-making process;
and NATO’s deterrence and defence posture that stands on a threat-based mix of
conventional, missile defence and nuclear capabilities. NATO’s strength lies in allied
unity and in the strength of the transatlantic link.

Estonia is an advocate of EU enlargement and NATO’s open door policy and supports
initiatives that assist countries aspiring to become members in preparing for accession and in ensuring their compliance with accession criteria.


-----

Following the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine, all like-minded countries need to continue supporting Ukraine politically, militarily and economically in a
sustained manner and to the required extent. It is in Estonia’s interests to help Ukraine
win the war, retain its independence and restore its territorial integrity. Estonia supports Ukraine’s accession to both the European Union and NATO. Estonia will be diplomatically active in Ukraine’s reconstruction process, provide military assistance,
contribute to the restoration of infrastructure destroyed during the war, offer its knowhow for the development of the Ukrainian state and economy and assist with the
treatment of war casualties. Estonia is also providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine.

In the United Nations (UN), the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe
(OSCE) and the Council of Europe, Estonia works to ensure the validity of the principles of global and regional peace and security, the prevention and peaceful resolution
of conflicts and, where necessary, the legitimate use of force as agreed in the UN
Charter, the Helsinki Final Act and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. These
organisations have their part to play in finding a solution to the aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine and to frozen conflicts in Europe.

Through development cooperation, humanitarian aid and by achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, Estonia contributes to the promotion of global stability
and to reducing the risk of crises and conflicts.

Promoting and defending Estonia’s interests on global issues requires a positive
image and considerable influence on the international arena. A proactive and constructive contribution to the digital, cyber, human rights, climate, energy and connectivity agenda increases Estonia’s involvement and allows to better protect its
interests in these areas, but also creates other opportunities. Participation in global
crises management builds cohesion beyond Estonia’s circle of closest allies, enhances
solidarity with Estonia and increases Estonia’s own ability to act effectively in any crisis. Bilateral and regional cooperation with countries in other regions around the world
creates the necessary preconditions and backdrop for finding support for Estonia’s
positions when key decisions are made in the UN and other international organisations.

Relationships with allies and partners empower Estonia’s security. Bilateral and
regional initiatives and cooperation within international organisations strengthen
unity and increase mutual ties and trust. Therefore, Estonia must find new ways to
promote its interests as well as continue in tried and tested formats.

The Baltic Sea region is considered one of the most stable, most integrated and most
effectively organised regions in Europe. The aggression of the Russian Federation
against Ukraine has revealed a number of challenges in the region, but at the same
time opened up new avenues. The accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO will
strengthen the region’s security, and Estonia is actively engaged in formulating the
new unified regional security arrangements.


-----

One component of international security and confidence is arms control. It implies that all
parties adhere to international law, fulfil their agreed obligations, and respect the territorial
integrity of other countries. The basis of effective international arms control is abiding by
the principles of transparency, trust and verification. It is important that arms control have a
negative impact on collective defence and deterrence, Estonia’s independent defence capabilities or lead to the creation of special regional arrangements. In the significantly deteriorated security environment, the relevance of restriction and control regimes of nuclear arms
and other weapons of mass destruction has become more pronounced, and Estonia must
be involved in shaping these regimes.
