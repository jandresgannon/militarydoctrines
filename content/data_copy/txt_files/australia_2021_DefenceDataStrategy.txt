##### Foreword

The Government’s key priority is to keep our nation safe and protect our way of life for future generations.

With this in mind, I welcome the release of the Defence Data Strategy 2021-2023.

Increasingly, the effective use and management of data will be critical to the successful conduct of
Defence operations, in times of conflict and in peace.

This Strategy will guide data management and improve data literacy across the Defence organisation.
This is critical to underpinning Defence’s mission-focus.

As we know from the 2020 Defence Strategic Update, and the Defence Transformation Strategy, lifting
Defence’s data maturity and leveraging it across the organisation will ensure we achieve a strategic
advantage over our adversaries.

We are straddling vast change in the Indo-Pacific region. The next decade will bring greater geostrategic
competition between nation states along with increased military modernisation. Grey zone tactics are now
being used to coerce states below the threshold of conventional war. The risks to Australia are concerning.

We live in a data-rich world in a digital age. Cyber espionage and warfare are a reality that we cannot
ignore. Whether we like it or not, we are joined in an online contest to preserve our personal security and
our digital sovereignty as a country.

This Strategy will enable Defence’s capacity to use data more effectively as our strategic
circumstances change.

As noted in the Defence Transformation Strategy, our Defence culture must recognise the criticality of data
to everything that we do, and adopt a disciplined and deliberate approach to how information is collected,
stored, analysed and applied in decision-making processes.

This is what the Defence Data Strategy 2021-2023 seeks to achieve.

I commend it to you.

**The Hon. Andrew Hastie MP**
Assistant Minister for Defence

##### A joint message from the Associate Secretary
 and Vice Chief of Defence Force

The world is experiencing rapid changes in digitisation and exponential growth in the creation of data. In
response, organisations across the government, non-government and industry sectors are increasing their
investment in data management to exploit new opportunities, provide better services and increase the
value they deliver to key stakeholders.

Defence holds many data assets across the enterprise, ranging from Defence mission and operational
data, through to policy and corporate enabling data. Improving data management will enhance our ability
to be successful in an era of geostrategic competition. It will enable warfighters to capitalise on strategic
and tactical opportunities that are currently unavailable in a fragmented data environment. It will help us
better understand our capacity and build a more resilient Defence enterprise.

We have a responsibility to harness the potential of our data and leverage it across the organisation
to achieve strategic advantage over our competitors. In doing so, we must increase the quality of our
decision-making capability. This will directly impact on our ability to defend Australia and its national
_interests, in order to advance Australia’s security and prosperity. Our ability to remain competitive depends_
on us becoming leaders in operationalising our data at speed and scale.

To become a more data-informed organisation and improve our ability to influence through evidencebased advice, we are pleased to present the Defence Data Strategy 2021-2023 (the Defence Data Strategy).
The Defence Data Strategy outlines Defence’s vision for data, the pillars that will support us on our journey
– Govern, Trust, Discover, Use, and Share, and the foundational initiatives required to achieve our vision.

We will value our data and remove barriers for Defence personnel to access and use it well. We will
develop a Defence culture that puts data at the centre of our decision-making.

This Defence Data Strategy is a call to all Defence personnel – no matter what level or rank. It is our
collective responsibility to lift our organisation’s data maturity to ensure we can continue to deliver on the
Defence Mission.

**Katherine Jones PSM** **Vice Admiral** **David Johnston AO RAN**

### Purpose

To achieve the Defence Mission, we must optimise
the strategic, operational and tactical use of our
data assets. The foundation of this is improved data
management practices. This will enable Defence
to access the right information at the right time to
support decision-makers.

**Defence Mission: To defend Australia and its national**
interests in order to advance Australia’s security
and prosperity.

Recognising data as an asset means taking
responsibility for it and understanding that it has
inherent quantifiable value to our organisation and
to others. Harnessing our data will allow us to take
decisions and actions that are backed by information
and insights gained through good data management.
It will give us a strategic advantage over our
competitors, make us a more effective fighting force
and further support the strategic centre through
improved decision-making.

The strategic centre includes the Defence leadership
and governance and accountability arrangements
that support our capacity to make informed decisions
and to ensure these decisions deliver on agreed policy
and strategy.


The Defence enterprise encompasses all of the
Groups and Services within the Department of Defence,
and their associated people, functions,
and outputs. The shared outcome that we generate
is our achievement of the Defence Mission through the
Defence strategic objectives (shape, deter, respond),
and the strategic effects outlined in the classified
_Defence Planning Guidance._

Through the development of the Lead the Way:
_Defence Transformation Strategy, senior leaders_
emphasised that Defence must recognise the
criticality of data. The Defence Data Strategy sets
out the vision, pillars, practical initiatives and
priority data areas to lift our data maturity and
work towards becoming a more data-informed
organisation.

We will embed data literacy as a cultural norm
and put useful and trusted information at the centre
of everything we do. The Defence Data Strategy
commits Defence to implementing foundational
enterprise-wide data initiatives. It will deliver
investment in leadership, data management and in
our people.


-----

The Defence Data Strategy covers all digitised data
in Defence, both structured and unstructured. This
includes, but is not limited to:

**•** Mission and operational data;

**•** Intelligence data;

**•** Capability development and management
data, including portfolio, program, and project
and product management;

**•** Corporate, human resources, and enabling
services data;

**•** Cost management and finance data;

**•** Industry and economic data, including
Australian defence industry and national
shipbuilding;

**•** Science, technology, and research data;

**•** Strategy and policy data; and

**•** Engineering and logistics data.


We are not starting from a blank slate. We have
pockets of excellence across the Defence enterprise.
The Defence Data Strategy will connect these areas
under a strategic framework to ensure we continue
to develop skilled people, equipped with the right
information, in order to make good decisions.


-----

-----

The 2020 Defence Strategic Update highlights
that Australia is at the centre of an increasingly
dynamic strategic environment. This environment is
challenging Defence’s ability to maintain a regional
capability edge in advanced warfighting and
enabling capabilities.

At the same time, the world is experiencing rapid
levels of digitisation and exponential growth in
the creation of data. The increasing connectivity
of services and infrastructure to the internet will
expose vulnerabilities in global supply chains,
critical infrastructure and support services. These
have the potential to be key targets in grey-zone
activities as well as in conventional conflict.

Emerging and disruptive technologies, highly
dependent on data, are being rapidly translated into
weapons systems. Advanced technologies, such
as artificial intelligence, robotics, and autonomous
systems, will reduce decision time and improve
precision and lethality.

The 2020 Force Structure Plan outlines an
ambitious capability program to respond to these
changing strategic circumstances. This capability
plan is providing the Australian Defence Force with
the capability required to project military power in
our region and beyond.


_Lead the Way: Defence Transformation Strategy,_
announced in November 2020, outlined the
necessity for Defence to be more agile and
adaptive. We must continuously transform the
organisation to ensure we can respond to any
contingency regardless of the source, nature
or scale.

Defence’s ability to make connections and
derive insights across diverse sources of data
will underpin the successful adoption of the
campaigning in competition approach our new
security environment requires.

Lifting our data practices and leveraging our
data holdings will be critical to shape Australia’s
strategic environment; deter actions against
Australia’s interests, and respond with credible
military force when required. It will enable
rapid well-informed decisions as the strategic
environment and Australian Government priorities
evolve. It will also provide a robust evidence base
for effectively prioritising resources in the midst
of changing circumstances.

## A vision for Defence data in 2023

Through dedicated data leadership and governance, Defence will have implemented the
foundational initiatives in the Defence Data Strategy. This will include:

**•** Data-driven insights becoming an embedded part of our work.

**•** The ability to rate the quality of data assets, against gold, silver and bronze standards, so
that our people automatically know the reliability of the data they are using.

**•** Information being delivered in the form of dashboards and visualisations, in preference to
lengthy briefs.

**•** Defence working towards near real-time access to workforce and capacity data to drive
agile resource prioritisation as priorities change.

**•** Defence being better equipped to capture, secure, understand, process, exploit and
disseminate data to enable critical capability for the joint force spanning the Command and
Control, Communications, Computers, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance,
and Electronic Warfare (C5ISREW) sensor to effector spectrum.

**•** Defence increasingly documenting data assets through standardised metadata tagging,
allowing personnel to search for and locate data from across the enterprise.

**•** Data management and workflow being increasingly automated, reducing the time and cost
required to manually identify, cleanse and manipulate data.

**•** Visibility across inflight initiatives and key data and information assets, tools and systems
to guide our technology investments.

**•** A range of options for data training and professionalisation, from foundational to advanced,
being readily available and personnel equipped to treat data securely and ethically.

**•** Increased use of visualisations and business intelligence tools to inform decision-making,
across all levels of Defence.

##### The importance
 of data in the battlespace

Command and Control, Communications,
Computers, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance
and Reconnaissance, or C5ISR, is the
provision of timely and trusted information
to support command decisions.

A wide variety of data is needed for
Commanders to decide what actions
to take to get a successful outcome.
Commanders must understand:

**•** Their troops, how they are
distributed geographically, what
they are capable of doing, and for
how long.

**•** The terrain and sea states, the
geographical formations, and
infrastructure to know how these
will impact the movement and
performance of troops, vehicles,
planes and ships.

**•** The weather and its impact on the
systems they use to detect and
counter hostile forces.

**•** The status of their supplies –
how much food and munitions
they have and how long until they
can be resupplied.

**•** The enemy, where they are, and
what the enemy are likely to do,
so they can determine how to
defeat them.

### Our Partners

###### International Aligning our data management and analytics


Together, the Five Eyes nations are all investing
in repositioning data as a strategic asset. As a
community we are taking ownership of data and
embedding the understanding that it has inherent,
quantifiable value to our respective organisations,
our partners, and our adversaries.


Rapid and secure data sharing between people,
platforms, and nations is at the heart of the US
Defense’s Joint All Domain Command and Control
concept. Our investment in data maturity will ensure
we can effectively operate under this construct
when working in partnership with the United States.

###### Australian Government

The Independent Review of the Australian
Public Service recommended that all Australian
Government agencies lift their digital and data
practices. This will lead to better policy advice,
regulation, and services for the Australian
Government and the Australian people.

To assist agencies to improve data management
practices, the Office of the National Data
Commissioner released The Foundational Four.
It guides agencies that are beginning their data
journey to improve their data practices and build
an organisational data culture.

_The Foundational Four identifies the following key_
requirements for success:

**•** **Leadership: A senior leader who is**
responsible and accountable for agency data;

**•** **Strategy: A clear vision and plan for using**
data to achieve objectives;

**•** **Governance: Established mechanisms to**
oversee data management; and

**•** **Asset Discovery: Identified and recorded**
data assets.


The implementation of this inaugural Defence
_Data Strategy will enable Defence to deliver on_
all of these requirements. It also forms part
of Defence’s contribution to the forthcoming
_Australian Data Strategy._

###### Australian Defence Industry

Defence has established strong partnerships
with Australia’s growing defence industry. This is
essential to our national security and to building
a strong and resilient economy.

Defence’s commitment to lifting our data maturity
will have multiple benefits for these partnerships
including:

**•** Providing greater value for money to
Defence and reducing the cost to industry in
competing for service delivery;

**•** Improving the design and delivery of the
capabilities Defence requires to manage
Australia’s strategic challenges; and

**•** Signalling to industry the specialist skills
required to develop innovative solutions for
new capabilities.

### Our Data Challenge

Defence faces many challenges in lifting its
data maturity.

We are a large, diverse organisation that undertakes
many different functions, from the warfighter to
the policy officer to the industry service provider in
the regions. Due to Defence’s size and diversity we
could easily take a view that enterprise-wide data
coordination and management is too hard and too
complex, and will not deliver real benefits. However,
to truly leverage the potential of our data assets and
exploit the opportunities it presents, we require the
ability to access data across the Whole-of-Defence.

Defence’s current approach to data management is
fragmented. With good intent, Groups and Services
have been pursuing independent approaches to
data management in the absence of dedicated
enterprise-level leadership and governance.
This has resulted in the development of ad hoc
standards, policies, and practices, and a narrow
focus on technology-driven solutions. It has also
sometimes manifested in an unwillingness to share
data across Groups and Services and a lack of trust
outside our immediate work area.


The absence of a Defence-wide approach to data
management and sharing has limited our capacity
to know what data we hold, where it is, how to
access it and whether it is of sufficient quality to
provide a reliable evidence base for decisions. This
has unfortunately led to large volumes of data being
collected that may be of negligible value, cannot be
reused, is often duplicated and is stored insecurely.

We also face challenges in:

**•** Not being aligned with Australian
Government, Five Eyes and best practice
standards;

**•** Low data literacy;

**•** Achieving an appropriate data workforce

industry personnel; and

**•** Technical Workforce; and

**•** Whole-of-Defence enterprise.

The three data maturity surveys provided responses
from nearly 4,000 people across every Group and
Service, from E01 (Private equivalent) to Senior
Executive Service Band 3 and Three Star officers.
The survey outcomes provided rich insights into
Defence’s data challenges and opportunities, and
helped to form a measurable data maturity baseline
for the organisation.

The surveys identified that failure to address
Defence’s low maturity will increase the risk of
skilled data literate people leaving Defence. It is also
likely to deter prospective employees from joining
Defence – including data specialists and those with
university qualifications who identified that their
skills were going unused.


A total of 731 respondents to the Whole-of-Defence
survey identified as having university or advanced
qualifications in data. Of these, 334 were public service
personnel and 258 were Australian Defence Force
personnel. A total of 1,298 personnel identified that they
would stay with Defence longer if it had mature data
management and analytics tools.

The data maturity surveys confirmed that Defence
has an overall low level of data maturity, with some
pockets of excellence. It also identified that people
across the organisation want to use data in a more
sophisticated manner and are passionate about the
opportunity to move into data-centric roles.

###### We invest in dedicated data leadership and governance across the enterprise


Data leadership and governance enables an
organisation to manage data effectively and to a
high standard throughout its lifecycle. It ensures
data is managed in line with enterprise-wide
policies and procedures, and that all personnel
within the organisation understand and practice
their responsibilities. This includes establishing
processes to ensure data availability, usability,
consistency, integrity and security.

###### Leadership

A data-driven culture requires passionate and
dedicated leadership who commit to delivering
avenues and opportunities for everyone.

To set the foundations for an uplift in Defence’s
data maturity, a Chief Data Integration Officer will
be established at the centre of the enterprise.
They will be responsible for embedding strong
data governance and management to achieve our
strategic objectives.

The Chief Data Integration Officer will be
accountable for delivering the Defence Data
_Strategy initiatives, driving cultural change around_
data, and supporting Defence to become a more
data-informed organisation. They will be the
job family owner for new data-centric roles and
professionalisation programs for public servants,
military and industry personnel.

The appointment of a Chief Data Integration Officer
does not negate the crucial data leadership role
performed by all levels across the organisation.
The role, instead, provides a central point of
leadership to coordinate and focus data initiatives
and governance.

Australian soldiers rely on access to the best possible technology to complete their mission,
whether it be training in Australia or deployed on operations. The Land Engineering Agency has
been supporting Australian soldiers for over 80 years by providing dedicated engineering services
throughout the land materiel capability lifecycle.

Developed by the Land Engineering Agency, Capability Acquisition and Sustainment Group, Vulcan
is a data engineering and analytics capability that leverages Defence’s strategic data assets to
improve mission success, both now and into the future. This is exemplified by the Vulcan Oil
Condition Monitoring framework which integrates datasets received from armoured vehicle
components, such as engines and gearboxes, usage history and maintenance records to evaluate
the condition of equipment and to automate maintenance actions.

The introduction of this framework provides multiple benefits to our soldiers.


###### Using our data to support Australian soldiers


-----

Soldiers gain increased availability to equipment by eliminating unnecessary maintenance
activities. Simultaneously, regular monitoring improves reliability through early detection and
prevention of failures that could put an operation at risk.

Defence is saving millions of dollars in maintenance costs by using data, such as oil sample
analysis and sensor readings, collected from vehicle components to determine when to service
equipment, rather than depending on fixed servicing intervals.

As data volumes increase over time the automation of data flows has become essential.

These automations include:

**•** Ability to enter usage and condition metrics directly into the Defence logistics information
system, enabling soldiers to devote more time to their primary tasking;

**•** An automated email service to notify the relevant maintenance authority when action is
required on vehicles; and

**•** A Defence web service enabling the automated transmission of oil analysis results from an
external laboratory to a central location within the Defence Protected Network Environment.

The Vulcan Oil Condition Monitoring framework demonstrates how complex technical datasets can
be transformed into insights to enable informed decision-making for soldiers.

These insights could only be achieved by establishing foundational data management practices.
The initiatives in the Defence Data Strategy are the foundational steps that Defence will take to
establish good data management practices that enable us to exploit the numerous datasets across
our enterprise.

###### Data as a Fundamental Input to Capability

Increasingly, Defence capability has significant
data dependencies. Capabilities require large
data inputs and the capacity to share data across
multiple platforms. They also produce large
amounts of data that needs to be managed,
stored, secured and, if appropriate, reused. The
centrality of data and information to warfighting,
and especially next-generation capabilities, has
markedly increased the importance of data as a
fundamental input to capability.

However, experience has shown that data
requirements are often not considered in the
initial design and development of capability. We
often have to retro-fit these requirements, creating
a number of additional challenges, costs and
risks, resulting in missed opportunities for joint
collaboration and efficiency.


Fundamental Inputs to Capability provide a
checklist designed to report on all inputs that
enable the effective and ongoing generation of
Defence capability.

Incorporating data into the Fundamental Inputs to
Capability model will ensure that requirements are
identified early, factored into the planning process
and considered across the capability lifecycle.

**1.7 Incorporate Data into the Command**

and Management Fundamental Inputs
to Capability. This will enable Capability
Managers to consider the data requirements
necessary to deliver optimal capability
outcomes and factor these into capability
projects and programs at the design stage.

###### Metadata matters

Army has a long history of confronting its adversary and completing the mission.


In 2020, the adversary took a very different form. Major crises, including bushfires and the COVID
pandemic, required Army to re-think how to respond.

Confronted with this new adversary, there was a hunger for fast, credible, relevant and actionable
information to support operational planning.

The Army Knowledge Centre harnessed information from across its databases to support the rapid
provision of knowledge to decision-makers. The Centre was able to do this through the design of
data structures and well-developed metadata standards that allowed information to be tagged.
These tags enabled searching by key words and themes across linked datasets.

Although the threat was different, planning at the start of these operations still needed to consider
tasking against relatively common lines of military effort. As the knowledge curated by the Centre is
structured around a schema for missions and planning considerations, extracting relevant lessons
into a concise report to meet Commanders needs at multiple levels was rapid.

Foundational metadata standards built into the database, facilitated the rapid generation of
products for operational planners that drew connections between key themes associated with the
mission and the prescribed tasks.

Defence has the potential to realise similar benefits across the enterprise. The foundational
initiatives in the Defence Data Strategy, in particular, cataloguing data assets, implementing
metadata standards, and improving discoverability, will support our information management and
knowledge application needs into the future.

###### Metadata matters

Army has a long history of confronting its adversary and completing the mission.

Harnessing the value of data can only be achieved
if all personnel know what data assets exist and
how to access them. The ability to discover and
access data creates an organisational mindset
where, no matter what your role or task, it is done
with all the relevant data and information available.

###### Data asset identification and discoverability

In Defence, we deliver advice to many stakeholders
including ministers, industry, and international
partners. We deliver services to meet a range of
needs and undertake operations both domestically
and internationally. Our ability to provide clear, timely,
and consistent advice, high-quality services and
achieve operational decision superiority is dependent
on the discoverability of our data assets.

When data remains in silos and is undiscoverable
or inaccessible it only serves the needs of a limited
area of the organisation. It restricts the development
of new insights and views that are produced by
combining datasets in different ways to identify
patterns and drives poor data security practices.

Defence will take an enterprise approach to
increasing the discoverability and accessibility of
our data holdings through:

**•** Cataloguing important data assets;

**•** Improving our ability to search for data; and

**•** Implementing the right systems, platforms
and tools to deliver on our data usage needs.


**What is a data asset?**

A data asset is any electronic data that exists in
computer systems. Data assets include a system or
application output file, database, document or web page.

**What is a data catalogue?**

A data catalogue is a detailed inventory of all data assets
in an organisation that uses metadata to help manage
those assets. It supports the collection and organisation
of data assets, and improves discoverability and access.

**Why is this important?**

Without a data catalogue we look for data by sorting
through documentation, talking to colleagues, or working
with familiar datasets. With a data catalogue we are
able to search and find data quickly, see all the available
datasets, evaluate and make informed choices about
what data to use and perform quality analysis efficiently.

We spend less time searching for data and more time
conducting analysis and producing insights and evidence.

**3.1 Establish and maintain an enterprise-wide**

data catalogue where Defence personnel
will be able to search for and locate data,
dashboards and visualisations for their
specific needs.

**3.2 Review the search functionality of Defence’s**

information systems and intranet to improve
the ability to access relevant data and
information in a timely manner.

**3.3 Establish an enterprise-level data**

platform to enable data integration, with
compartmentalisation embedded to manage
access and use across specialised areas and
security levels.


###### We know what data assets Defence has, where they are and how to access them

Artificial intelligence will play a vital role in Defence’s future operating environment. This emerging
technology will be critical to delivering on our strategic objectives of shape, deter and respond.
Maintaining a capable, agile and potent Australian Defence Force is becoming increasingly
dependent on artificial intelligence technologies.

What is not so well understood is that for Defence to harness the opportunities presented by rapidly
advancing artificial intelligence technologies, our data holdings must be managed and discoverable
in a way that supports the development of artificial intelligence tools. These tools must be able to
leverage Defence’s data to operate at their full potential.

Defence is taking steps to prepare for this future.

Defence has established the Defence Artificial Intelligence Centre in the Joint Capabilities Group.
It will accelerate our capability foundations and the understanding and implementation of
coordinated artificial intelligence technologies across the enterprise.

Joint Capabilities Group, in partnership with the Chief Information Office and Defence Science and
Technology, has established the Defence Technology Acceleration Collaboration Laboratory. It will

###### Document and content management

Document and content management is a key
component of data management. It covers the
capture, storage, access and use of data and
information stored outside relational databases.

As we move to an increased focus on digitisation,
Defence is creating and collecting more records
than ever before. As at June 2021, an average of
6.2 million documents were being captured by the
enterprise each month.

Defence has legislated responsibilities to create,
manage, preserve and retain information in order
to meet the provisions of the Archives Act 1983 and
accountability to the Australian Government and the
Australian people.

Continuing to improve how Defence creates,
manages and uses its information and data will
require an ongoing emphasis on governance,
capability building and reducing areas of
information management inefficiency and risk.


We also need to develop a strong understanding of
the importance of effective records management
in our personnel. Our people need to understand
how to undertake records management and why
it matters. Developing a library of simple and clear
factsheets and guides will better support our people
and strengthen our records management practice.

In order to produce better mapping and measurement inputs for the Defence Corporate Plan and
Enterprise Risks process, Navy has developed a strategic performance and risk management
system. This system maps key activities and deliverables that identify and scope mitigation
activities and assurance functions. With the subsequent development of a quantitative
measurement system to support decision-making by Chief of Navy’s Strategic Advisory Council we
have undertaken a back to first principles review of data streams within Navy - where they go and
what they are used for.

Navy’s vision is to use existing data and information systems from across the Service and the
Defence enterprise to inform business performance reporting, rather than implementing another
set of adjacent Navy specific reporting processes that would result in productivity and efficiency
costs to personnel.

Conceptually, this is intuitive and straightforward. In reality we double or triple handle data using
disparate and unintegrated systems. This has been driven by iterative development, as well as
the highly deployable and agile nature of maritime platforms and their management across all
fundamental inputs to capability.

This quiet revolution in data usage is seeing the creation and deployment of data pipelines direct
from existing applications and systems into central awareness tools from which decisions can be
made and appropriate resources allocated.

In time, this will include direct input from established systems, including PMKeyS, the Capability
Development Management and Reporting Tool, and Smart Owner. While the implementation of this
quantitative based system is being introduced iteratively across the Five Navy outputs, there has
already been observable improvements in the timeliness of assessments.

The continued refinement and adjustment of this information system, enhanced through greater
consistency in datasets to enable increased utilisation of automated bot processes, will continue
to enhance decision-making within Navy. It will also increase Navy’s understanding and tracking of
strategic outputs for the wider Defence enterprise.

The value of data is realised when it is transformed
into information, insights and, ultimately, decisions
and actions. To do this, Defence needs to be able
to distil a lot of data easily – whether it be in the
office, on training exercises, or in the battlespace.
We must empower people across the enterprise to
easily and quickly consume information, and make
better, more informed decisions.

To achieve this, Defence will provide our people
with the necessary training and tools to transform
our data into valuable and influential insights.
We will equip our people with the skills to
understand, develop, and communicate using data

The security and resilience of Australian sovereign capabilities are of paramount importance
to Defence.

Defence’s supply chains are globalised with complex assembly components manufactured by
companies located across a number of different countries with differing geopolitical influence
levels. From both a security and resilience perspective, Defence seeks to understand its supply
chains to ensure a continuity of supply.

The Capability Acquisition and Sustainment Group is making significant inroads into understanding
Defence supply chains. This will be enhanced by the establishment of the Defence Supply Network
Analysis Program, to be delivered by the end of 2021.

The Program will use Open Source intelligence data collection, accelerated by machine learning
and data-driven analytics, to map and identify opportunities and potential risk exposures in our
supply networks.

Through this Program, and in line with the Defence Data Strategy, Capability Acquisition and
Sustainment Group recognises the need for the organisation to move away from using data as a
rear-view mirror and towards integrating analytics directly into our daily decision-making.

Beyond this, the Program will provide Defence visibility of its supply chains, making them more
transparent across multiple tiers. By doing so, Defence will be better equipped to understand the
specific risk lens that apply to our supply networks – be it financial, operational or geopolitical –
and actively monitor red flags as they arise in real-time.

## PRIORITY
 DATA AREAS


-----

Defence is a very large, complex organisation with
vast data holdings and constantly shifting priorities.

To ensure we focus our effort in the right places,
five priority data areas have been identified to drive
Defence’s data uplift over the next two years. All
five areas address high priority questions facing
the organisation where data and analytics can
enhance decision-making. They also require the
combining of datasets from across the enterprise,
rather than from single domains. The Chief Data
Integration Officer will drive the design and delivery
of the five data priorities, in partnership with
domain leads.

###### Workforce: What personnel do we have, where are they located, what do they do, and what skills do they have?

Determining how to best utilise our workforce
requires a robust enterprise view of the whole of
Defence workforce - Australian Defence Force,
Australian Public Service, and industry.

Prioritising our workforce, adjusting rapidly as
priorities change, and investing in future skills
requires a near real-time view of our people.
We also hold a duty of care to all personnel
deployed across Australia and the globe. To
exercise this responsibility fully we need to have
a common picture of our personnel.


###### Capability Delivery: Are we delivering the right capabilities at the right time?

_The 2020 Force Structure Plan outlines a capability_
program of over $270 billion over 10 years to
respond to our changing strategic circumstances.
Defence must be well positioned to understand
how it is delivering against the Force Structure
_Plan and whether that Plan will deliver the_
capability effects required to meet our future
strategic challenges. Defence is also required
to provide the Australian Government and the
Australian people, where appropriate, with answers
to these questions.

Bringing together data, analytics and automation
will provide better insights into capability delivery,
help us understand if our projects and programs
are on track to deliver the right capability effect,
and support reprioritisation of the Integrated
Investment Program when our strategic
circumstances change.

###### Organisational Capacity: How do we better understand our organisational capacity and provide policy advice to Government on the impact of responding to new requirements and unplanned contingencies?

public service personnel are also being deployed
across Australian government agencies.


-----

We are supporting the Australian Government in
ways we have never done before, starting with the
COVID pandemic response and continuing through
the new public service surge workforce initiatives.

The capacity of Defence to maintain, and potentially
increase, this new operating tempo needs to be
better understood. Data and analytics will provide
an evidence base to better manage capacity
challenges and provide clear policy advice to the
Australian Government on the organisation’s ability
to respond to new requirements, and potential
adjustments that may be required.

###### Strategic Taskforces: How do we rapidly stand up strategic taskforces and support their unique data management needs?

Strategic taskforces are increasingly used
as a mechanism to support Defence’s role in
responding to emerging temporary priorities.
In the last 24 months Defence has created
taskforces to respond to the 2019/2020 Black
Summer Bushfires, the COVID pandemic, the
Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force
Afghanistan Inquiry, and the Royal Commission
into Defence and Veteran Suicide.

Establishing strategic taskforces requires an
ability to quickly determine capability needs and
understand which personnel across the enterprise
are best suited to these roles. There is also a need
to quickly understand the property and information
technology requirements of the strategic taskforce.
Once established, there are usually specific and
unique data management processes that need to
be established, including real-time data visualisation
and historical records management. This priority
data area will be a valuable resource as Defence
continues to employ taskforces to address
emerging issues.


###### Lifetime Wellbeing of Current and Former Serving ADF Members and their Families: How can we better support whole-of-life health, wellbeing and safety outcomes for current and former Australian Defence Force members and their families?

In response to the 2019 Productivity Commission’s
‘A Better Way to Support Veterans’ Report
(Recommendation 11.2), the Australian Government
agreed that Defence and the Department of
Veterans’ Affairs would develop a joint Data
Sharing and Analytics Solution, underpinned by
complementary Wellbeing Frameworks.

The Data Sharing and Analytics Solution will link
data on serving Australian Defence Force members
with internal Defence systems data and Department
of Veterans’ Affairs client data. It will provide near
real-time, actionable insights through a feedback
loop designed to improve health, wellness, and
safety outcomes. In the longer term, it will provide
a whole-of-life view which will deliver insights into
future service and compensation needs, based on
serving military members’ activity and incidents;
and the ability to examine relationships between
service exposure and subsequent Department of
Veterans’ Affairs claims.

Data from across the Defence enterprise is
required to support this solution, along with
Department of Veterans’ Affairs data. Delivering
on this initiative is a high priority for the Australian
Government, Defence, and the Department of
Veterans’ Affairs. The uplift and management of
data and analytics required to deliver the Data
Sharing and Analytics Solution, funded through
the 2021-22 Budget, will be prioritised across the
life of the Defence Data Strategy. This will ensure
the initiative delivers real benefits for Australian
Defence Force members and veterans within the
agreed timeframes.


are best suited to these roles. There is also a need
to quickly understand the property and information
technology requirements of the strategic taskforce.
Once established, there are usually specific and
unique data management processes that need to
be established, including real-time data visualisation
and historical records management. This priority
data area will be a valuable resource as Defence
continues to employ taskforces to address
emerging issues.

## MEASURING

 SUCCESS


-----

### How will we know we
 are making progress?

Across the five pillars there are 27 initiatives
designed to build our data maturity and deliver real
outcomes for Defence. The data uplift delivered
through these initiatives will:

**•** Improve the agility and speed of our
decision-making;

**•** Reduce the time and effort required to build
an evidence-base;

**•** Help us better understand and manage
capacity pressures and resource
prioritisation;

**•** Strengthen our management of capability
data requirements; and

**•** Deliver increased intelligence, situation
awareness, and tactical advantage.


Over this time, Defence recognises that we may
need to adjust our approach and evolve with the
environment, such as a changing technological
landscape and the impact this has on data
management practices.

Defence must ensure that we are making progress
towards our vision that Defence’s data is a strategic
asset – we value it, protect it, and leverage it to
deliver strategic and operational advantage. Given
