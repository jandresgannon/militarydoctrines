# Contents Transformation Of The Romanian Armed Forces - A Direct Answer To Emerging Challenges

Over the past 20 years, the Romanian Military System has gone through an important conceptual and structural transformation, determined by the development of the constantly changing security environment, as well as by the accession of our country to NATO and EU. 

The transformation was intended to ensure the capabilities needed to promote and protect national interests against current and future threats so that Romania can be able to fulfill its commitments to NATO, EU and other international security and defense organizations. This triggered doctrinal and organizational changes, along with significant adjustments in the force structure and connected areas, such as capabilities, intelligence, training and education, acquisitions, personnel management, budgeting and planning.

The restructuring process was essentially called for by the overall process of social and military reform, and by the differences between the oversized structure of the military system (over 300,000 people) and the poor socio-economical potential to support it, as well as by limitations imposed by international treaties, in terms of downsizing and reduction of armaments (the Vienna Document and the Paris Treaty). There were some major milestones in the transformation process, such as the signing of the Partnership for Peace (26th January, 2004) and of the Strategic Partnership with the US (11th July, 1997), the adoption of the Membership Action Plan (MAP) planning system, starting with 1999. They all marked the beginning of the process of harmonizing the measures By 2025, the transformation process will consist of the following stages:
•	 The first stage - **the Basic Reorganization Process** - (2005-2007)
was completed. The next short-term objectives of the transformation process were accomplished: restructuring and reorganization of the management system at the strategic and operational levels, initiating the process of making the NATO and EU designated forces operational as established in the force planning processes of the two organizations; creating an all volunteer force etc.

•	 The second stage of the transformation deals with the **Operational** 
Integration into NATO and EU (2008-2015). At this point, we are going to meet the medium-term goals of transformation, which consist of: continuing making the NATO and EU designated forces operational, continuing the acquisition of new equipment, implementing the major procurement programs and re-organizing the military educational system according to the conception established, increasing participation in NRF and the contribution to EU's defense capabilities.

•	 The third stage, the **Full Technical Integration into NATO and** 
European Union (2016/2025), will enable the fulfillment of the long-term transformation objectives. The efforts and the financial and human resources will converge to meet the assumed capabilities included into Capability Targets. The participation in the NATO and EU missions and operations and the further upgrading and equipping of the forces as well as the interoperability with other EU and NATO armed forces are some of the long-term transformation objectives.

taken and activities developed by the Romanian Armed Forces and NATO.

In this context, the basic aim of the transformation process is to adjust the Romanian Armed Forces structure to the current and future security environment evolution in order to be able to fulfill our national commitments to the Alliance, according to NATO's transformation roadmap. The final goal is to enable the Romanian Armed forces to take part in the wide range of missions carried out by the Alliance and European Union.

The aspects and activities are detailed into an Implementation P l a n i n a c c o r d a n c e w i t h t h e Transformation Strategy guidelines. It is developed by the General Staff and is subject to regular updating based on the new challenges including those referred to in the NATO Transformation Strategy.

Aiming to achieve the mediumterm transformation goals, at this level Romania will continue to:
•	 Make the forces operational
•	 Develop/implement the major procurement programs
•	 Fulfil the interoperability require-ments
•	 Adopt the new C2 structure
•	 Adapt national processes to the

![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)

![3_image_1.png](3_image_1.png)

NATO and EU capability-based defense planning system. During the first two stages of the transformation process, the Romanian Armed Forces have been participating in all major NATO, EU or coalition-led operations worldwide, in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan.

By taking part in these operations, we have enjoyed excellent opportunities in training our forces in real battlefield conditions so that we can adapt our vision and plans according to lessons learned.

The next step for us, on medium and long terms, will be to develop activities aimed at adopting and implementing a coherent and viable program at the national level, to incorporate the concepts developed and implemented by NATO and EU. In this respect, following the validation and implementation of these concepts, we will concentrate on an efficient force engagement, achievement of the information superiority, expeditionary forces, joint maneuvering, integrated logistics, a closer civil-military cooperation, and establishment of network-based capabilities. 

A specific process is also needed to develop specific capabilities within the unique package of the Romanian Armed Forces, designated 

![3_image_2.png](3_image_2.png) to accomplish the entire range of missions, in order to better coordinate the effort. This process will set the necessary framework to develop all the structures, thus, generating the capabilities dedicated to NATO, EU processes and initiatives, as well as to the national purposes. 

Thus, the transformation will be, in the first place, a direct answer to emerging challenges, and secondly, a catalyst to the modernization of the forces and a contributor to their reform and reorganization, and thirdly, the leading element to better force generation and engagement process.

The transformation of the Romanian Armed Forces is not a goal in itself, but a continuous process, and a proper answer to the evolution of the security environment, to the NATO and EU transformation and to the Romanian commitments at the international level. This process also requires substantial resources and efforts.

The future will not necessarily belong to the state-of-the-art technologies but rather to those forces rapidly reacting to major changes, able to quickly and efficiently adapt to the requirements imposed by the constantly changing security environment.

# Romania'S Participation In Regional Cooperation Initiatives

At the beginning of the 90s, the crisis in the Balkans required new forms of political and military cooperation.

South-Eastern Europe was divided by different political and economic systems and military relations at different stages of development, with infrequent contacts at the highest level and little practical work between their armed forces.

I
n the existing frame, both NATO and EU promoted the regional cooperation, as a way of exercising the negotiations and collaboration skills, mutual recognition of the participants, with the goal to increase trust and to reinforce security.

All these accomplishments stand for the professionalism and dedication of all the structures involved which resulted in a long-term pragmatic relation driven by common security interests.

Thus, Romania has significantly contributed and encouraged a cooperation framework, so that common solutions to common threats may be identified.

Regional cooperation activities are based on bilateral or multinational agreements, protocols and memoranda. 

At regional level, the Ministry of National Defence coordinates Romanian participation in the following initiatives relevant in the military and security field:
•	 South-Eastern Europe defence ministerial process
(**SEDM**)
•	 Black Sea naval cooperation task group (**BLACKSEAFOR**)
•	 The multinational engineer battalion **TISA** •	 Romanian-Hungarian peace keeping battalion (**RO-HU BAT**) •	 Romanian-Bulgarian defence advisory group (DAG)
The Black Sea Naval Cooperation Task Group (BLACKSEAFOR) is an initiative developed by the countries in the region, aiming to contribute to regional security and stability and enhance regional cooperation. The participants are Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russian Federation, Turkey, and Ukraine. 

Its main strategic goal is to provide to the Extended Black Sea Region a more inclusive and internationalized profile for a more intense Euro-Atlantic cooperation and avoidance of narrow security arrangements that may lead, in the end, to a further isolation.

## Bucharest Takes Over Sedm Chairmanship Between 2013 And 2015

![5_Image_0.Png](5_Image_0.Png)

The South Eastern Defence Ministerial (SEDM) **process**
was initiated by the defence ministers at their meeting in 1997, in Sofia. The current member states are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Macedonia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, Turkey, the United States and Ukraine; as observers: Moldova and Georgia.

SEDM provides the participating states with the necessary means to prove the international community that they are evolving from the status of security consumers to security providers. 

SEDM has developed an institutional infrastructure which consists of the committees and working groups focused on finding solutions to regional security-related problems. Thus, SEDM stands for a self-sustainable initiative, unique in the region, with the goal of promoting a culture of cooperation.

Romania's active presence within the SEDM has been demonstrated, throughout the 11-year existence of this regional initiative, by its participation and involvement in all projects initiated and **developed under the SEDM aegis**. 

## Romania'S Objectives

Chairmanship is assumed for a period of two years by SEDM member states. During 2001-2003, Romania chaired for the first time the SEDM Coordination Committee
(SEDM-CC) and the Political Military Steering Committee
(PMSC) of the Multinational Peace Force South Eastern Europe (MPFSEE). Romania takes over the chairmanship starting with July 2013 and intends to implement five priority goals: 
•	 Maintaining transparency and open doors policy of the Initiative, by admitting, from the current Observers, new members in SEDM and MPFSEE;
•	 Improving the SEDM contribution to security and stability in SE Europe through a more efficient use of the political - military dialogue in order to enhance the confidence and security in the region and improve the relationships with the other regional initiatives.

•	 Finding solutions for strengthening the interest of the member states in supporting the current SEDM projects and respectively, for launching new projects according to current regional and international requirements.

•	 Finalizing the SEDM Strategic Review and updating the legal base accordingly. Making the final decision regarding SEEBRIG HQ location (permanent or on rotational basis) and promoting a new rotational chart for SEDM Chairmanship and SEEBRIG Command.

•	 Identifying the best solutions for the future of MPFSEE/
SEEBRIG. Romania pays a great attention to the main projects launched within SEDM. For the near future, Romania considers that SEDM projects need to be constantly adapted and developed by making sure that they properly respond 

![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)

to the continuously changing security environment, both at 

![6_image_1.png](6_image_1.png) regional and global level.

The main projects launched within SEDM are:
•	 Multinational Peace Force South-Eastern Europe/SouthEastern European Brigade (MPFSEE / SEEBRIG)
•	 Interconnection of Military Hospitals (IMIHO) •	 South-Eastern Europe Simulation Network (SEESIM)
•	 Female Leaders in Security and Defence (FLSD)
•	 Building Integrity Project (BI)

## Seebrig - Operational Component Of Sedm

The Multinational Peace Force, South-Eastern Europe 
(MPFSEE) - also known as the South Eastern Europe Brigade (SEEBRIG) - was established at the third annual South Eastern Europe Defence Ministerial (SEDM) meeting in Skopje, September 26th, 1998. SEEBRIG has been operational since the 1st of May, 2001. 

The participants are Albania, Bulgaria, Republic of Macedonia, Greece, Italy, Romania and Turkey. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia, Ukraine and USA have the status of observers. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Ukraine will be part of MPFSEE, as soon as they fulfil their internal legal procedures. 

At this point we want to recall the types of Operations SEEBRIG can be involved in: Peace Support Operations, under UN or OSCE mandates, based on formalresolutions. Deployment of each national contingent is subject to prior governments' approval, after consultations among member nations.

For the near future, Romania appreciates that the countries from the region having the status of "SEDM 
observer" should analyze the possibility to become fullflagged members of this Initiative and of its related projects, focusing on the Multinational Peace Force South-Eastern Europe (MPFSEE) project, with its operational component, namely the SEEBRIG. 

After the evaluation process by NATO, SEEBRIG's operational readiness with limitations was declared (caused by the stage of CIS implementation - communication and information system). 

Romania appreciates that SEEBRIG's deployment to Afghanistan, in 2006, was a success. The Brigade proved its interoperability with other operational structures of the North-Atlantic Alliance. At the same time, the mission set new and superior standards for other projects under the aegis of SEDM.

We believe that the future deployment of SEEBRIG will be a critical credibility test for the whole SEDM process.

TISA battalion's mission is the surveillance and the urgent interventions in natural disaster situations in Tisa river area as well as the participation in disaster relieve missions. The participants are Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Ukraine. 

In 2012, Romania assumed the chairmanship of TISA 
Steering Group with significant results. In order to increase the visibility and importance of the initiative, an open door policy was promoted, by attracting new members. In this respect, the participants were informed about Romania's 

![7_image_0.png](7_image_0.png)

![7_image_2.png](7_image_2.png)

efforts to support Republic of Serbia's formal request to 

![7_image_1.png](7_image_1.png) access to this initiative.

The chairman of TISA regional initiative Steering Group proposed that the multinational battalion's area of responsibility be extended also to the Danube River area during the next missions assigned. If the proposal of the Steering Group Chairman became feasible and accepted by the member states of the initiative, the importance of the regional TISA initiative would increase also by attracting new countries in the region.

Standard Operating Procedures and Humanitarian Aid Request have been approved to be used for future exercises or real situations. 

The Multinational Battalion, being now in a stand-by position, could become a real and efficient instrument for the relive of the consequences of natural disaster in the region. 

The Romanian-Hungarian Joint Peacekeeping Battalion's mission is to build trust and improve interoperability in order to carry out peacekeeping operations and humanitarian missions, whether under UN or OSCE mandate or led by NATO or the EU, in Eastern or Central Europe, but also on the other territories of the continent.

Romania and Bulgaria initiated in 2011 a new form of cooperation at defense political directors' level, called DAG (Defense Advisory Group), in order to facilitate and identify new common approaches and possibilities for bilateral military cooperation. During the meetings, both parties presented their national perspective on regional security, main top-priority investment projects and their multinational and innovative approaches such as the participation in EU's Pooling and Sharing Initiative.

# Romania In Nato **Smart** Defence And Eu **Pooling And** Sharing **Initiatives**

S
mart Defense is an open-ended and ambitious initiative with an extended timeframe. Its basic philosophy encompasses more than limited short term projects; it is about a new way of thinking and a new approach to planning and developing defense capabilities. 

The current economic environment presents a harsh and uncontested reality: more and more NATO member states cannot fulfill their financial responsibilities as previously scheduled, this having a direct impact on their ability to maintain and develop the required defense capabilities. The underfunding of the defense sector may cause additional vulnerabilities in a world where the security challenges are on the rise. 

The major challenge in the effort to remedy the current shortfalls in the core defense capabilities consists in the collective capacity to maximize the capabilities by using the limited available resources. The Chicago Summit formalized this approach and started the "Smart Defense era". 

Multinational cooperation is a key factor for defense capability development. The descendent trend of our national defense budget has had a negative impact on the acquisition programs. We have made efforts to stop this decline and we succeeded in obtaining a gradual annual increase of 0.3 % of the GDP. We are also trying to find ways to improve the resource prioritization. 

Even before the Smart Defense initiative was launched, we gained a signif icant experience in the multinational cooperation field, being an active member in initiatives such as: Airborne Warning & Control System (AWACS), Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) and Missile Defense (MD). 

At Chicago Summit, Romania expressed its intention of joining to 40 out of a total of 150 projects as part NATO Smart Defense initiative, such as: Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle Maintenance; Deployable Contract Specialist Group; Centers of Excellence as hub of Education & Training.

The European Union similar initiative is known under the name of Pooling and Sharing, This is not a new concept for Romania, since our country has been involved in many multinational cooperation projects at the EU level, such as: Strategic Airlift Capability (C-17), European Air Transport Fleet (EATF), Level 2 Counter Improvised Explosive Devices Laboratory deployed in Afghanistan (TEL-D) and European Satellite Communication Procurement Cell (ESCPC).

Our participation in Pooling and Sharing initiatives aims at increasing military capabilities by adopting multinational solutions when the development of the respective capability is neither possible nor economically feasible strictly on a national basis. The goal is to preserve and enhance national operational capabilities and to identify innovative solutions for the best efficient use of the resources allocated for defense. 

On the long term perspective, the European ministers of defense adopted the "Code of Conduct on Pooling and Sharing" on November 19th, 2012. This Code is aimed at integrating Pooling and Sharing principles into the EU Member States' planning and decision-making processes. Romania acknowledges the importance of the harmonization of the Member States' defense planning processes as an essential element for facilitating multinational cooperation. Integration of the pooling and sharing provisions into the national defense planning processes requires full complementarities between the EU initiative and the similar NATO endeavors in order to avoid unnecessary duplication.

# Us-Romania Strategic Partnership

Initiated in 1997, the Strategic Partnership between US and Romania establishes privileged bilateral relations between the two states and, at the same time, stands for the framework for bilateral military cooperation by providing the basis for mutually beneficial projects.

Ceremony occasioned by the deployment 

![9_image_0.png](9_image_0.png) of elements of US missile defence system on the Romanian territory, Deveselu, May, 2011 T
he most important component of our bilateral partnership in the defense area is represented by the force training and operational cooperation programs with a view to achieving and preserving all the forces' interoperability aspects, relevant for our participation in future common operations.

Another very relevant dimension of the Romanian-American partnership is the strategic dialogue within the Bilateral Defense Consultations process, envisaged as a way to engage both parties in a comprehensive dialogue on a wide range of common interest topics as defense policy, international security and the evolution of the international security organizations.

Over the years, the bilateral cooperation with the American armed forces has become the most consistent component of the Romanian bilateral military cooperation network.

The status of the deployment of the US ballistic missile defense system in Deveselu The Deveselu site is mentioned as being one of the most important elements of the strategic partnership between Romania and United States of America in the security field, and a valuable contribution to the development of NATO's missile defence capabilities.

Deveselu project is part of the US ballistic missile defense system deployment program, which is to be set up in three phases, in Europe (United States European Phased Adaptive Approach - EPAA). This approach comes within the context of the increasing threats on the proliferation of ballistic missiles. The United States ballistic missile defense system will contribute to the development of the NATO's missile defence capability.

The system which will be deployed to Deveselu will be part of the North Atlantic Alliance's initial missile defence capability. Also, the development of a capability to defend NATO populations and territories against ballistic missile attack is also a core element of the collective defence against the security challenges, mentioned in the Strategic Concept adopted in Lisbon.

The first EPAA phase has already been implemented through the deployment in 2011 of a warship equipped with the AEGIS system to the Mediterranean Sea and by making an early warning radar operational in Turkey, within the framework of the NATO interim capability declared at the Chicago Summit in 2012.

The second stage consists in the deployment by 2015 to Romania of the AEGIS Ashore system, which will be able of launching SM (Standard Missiles)-3 IB intercepting missiles. The third one will consist in the deployment of the AEGIS Ashore system to Poland by 2018.

The Deveselu project's development implies two courses of action for Romania. The first one regards the legal aspects and the other one the infrastructure ones.

From legal point of view, in order to implement the Agreement between Romania and the United States of America on the Deployment of the United States Ballistic Missile Defense System in Romania (BMDA), the two countries established another additional 24 Implementing Arrangements (IAs) and amendments to the already existent IAs, necessary to enforce the Agreement between Romania and the United States of America regarding

# Rou Military Contribution To Nato-Led Operations

2nd of April 2004. The flag-raising ceremony for the seven new NATO members is taking place at the NATO HQ in Brussels. Romania is among the newcomers. It has been 9 years since the Romanian Military first participated in NATO-led missions as a full-fledged partner and become part of the common effort of keeping peace and stability in the world.

Y
et Romania's contribution to NATO-led operations began much earlier, as far back as 1996. All this time, according to the obligations assumed, Romania has maintained a continued military presence, with variably-sized forces from all the services (Army, Air Forces, Navy), in the multinational operations of the North Atlantic Alliance.

Looking back, it would be worth mentioning that Romania's contribution to NATO led began as a Partner state, in the Western Balkans, Bosnia and Herzegovina, with an Engineer Battalion (200 troops), first on the NATO-IFOR mission (Implementation Force) and subsequently on the NATO-SFOR "Joint Guardian" (Stabilization Force). Since March 2000, Romania has also been present in the NATOKFOR operation (Kosovo province) with staff personnel and company-sized specialized units. 

Security and stability in the Western Balkan area are of great 

![11_image_0.png](11_image_0.png)

![11_image_1.png](11_image_1.png)

![11_image_2.png](11_image_2.png)

![11_image_5.png](11_image_5.png)

importance to Romania. That is why our country will continue to play a pro-active role in stabilizing this area by deploying 60 staff and specialized personnel units backed up by a Mobile Infantry Company of the SACEUR Strategic Reserve.

Another important NATO-led mission Romania contributed to was an air police mission in the Baltic States conducted during August-October 2007 with 65 military personnel and four MIG 21L aircrafts.

Apart from the substantial contribution to Coalition Operation "Iraqi Freedom", Romania was one of the first countries to send military experts and training personnel to the NATO Training Mission in Iraq (NTM-I). 

Moreover, from 2005 through 2011, Romania constantly contributed with a frigate to the NATO-ACTIVE
ENDEAVOUR Operation in the Mediterranean Sea.

MRAP-s proved to be efficient in countering

![11_image_8.png](11_image_8.png) the Improvised Explosive Devices by saving the lives of the Romanian militaries The recent crises from the Middle East and Northern Africa culminating with the bloody conflict in Libya and threats to the civilian population led to the evacuation of the Romanian and European citizens and leveraged our participation in the NATO led operation. For 90 days, between April to July, 2011, Romania participated in "UNIFIED PROTECTOR" NATO operation for imposing arms embargo on Libya, with Frigate 221 - "King Ferdinand" (with 207 militaries), thus playing an important role to the allied effort to end the conflict.

The most significant and long-lasting Romanian contribution to an international operation is the participation in the International Security and Assistance Force in Afghanistan, under NATO command. The Romanian contribution began in 2002 with a military police platoon and a C-130 transport aircraft and steadily grew and reconfigured yearly according to the theatre of operations' requirements ![12_image_0.png](12_image_0.png)

By participating in the NATO-led missions and operations, the Romanian military personnel contributed to the increase of confidence and stability at regional level and to the promotion of defence diplomacy.

The Romanian military contribution to operations and missions overseas brought both operational and credibility gains. Among the operational benefits, we can enumerate: lessons learned in the theatres of operation, staff and units' personnel training according to NATO SOPs, the increased interoperability, operational evaluation of the equipment in real conflict environment and adjustment of major procurement programs based on the deficiencies observed.

As far as the credibility benefits are concerned, Romania has proved to be a reliable partner for the North-Atlantic Alliance, and a regional and global security provider. For the first time ever, as a NATO member, Romania enjoys the right to a security warranty and directly participates in the 

# Afghanistan: 1600 Troops Deployed In The Hotest Area Of Operations

At present, Romania participates in NATO (ISAF) operation with 1,600 militaries, while having its contingent distributed mainly in the RC-SOUTH's area of responsibility and also in other ISAF structures. The contingent is mainly made up of Battalion-type structures (2), detachments and staff personnel.

Romania's participation in operations in Afghanistan began in February, 2002, by providing support to the International Security Assistance Force I, when this mission was not conducted by NATO.

Furthermore, on July 2002, a Romanian Battalion was deployed in Afghanistan as part of ENDURING FREEDOM coalition-type operation with the mission of securing the Kandahar Airport.

In 2005, the Romanian battalion which was nominated as SACEUR strategic reserve was deployed to Kabul for 4 months in order to provide security during the elections from Afghanistan.

Beginning with 2006, once with the extension of ISAF 
mission on the Afghan territory, the main effort was relocated from Operation ENDURING FREEDOM to the NATO-led one. The Romanian maneuver battalion from Kandahar was redeployed to Qalat with the help of the US partner, the Romanian forces being responsible for providing security in Zabul province. 

After 2006, the Romanian contribution constantly increased. On the other hand, our participation in Operation Enduring Freedom ceased in 2010. Thus, Romania contributed with troops not only to the ISAF operation but also to Operation ENDURING FREEDOM. 

Also, in 2010, when other contributing countries started withdrawing their troops from Afghanistan, Romania supplemented its contingent with another maneuver battalion; thus, Romania deployed 2 maneuver battalions and a Command and Control Element (Combined Team Zabul) in Zabul province.

Beginning with April 2011, Romania deployed personnel assigned to provide security on Kabul International Airport. Also, in 2011, Romania held a flag-officer position within ISAF.

More than 20,000 Romanian militaries were deployed to the Afghan theater of operations throughout the 11 years of mission, 20 of these militaries being killed in action and 119 injured.

A new redeployment of national contributions in this 

![13_image_0.png](13_image_0.png)

operation was initiated in the first semester of 2013 based on the strategic planning documents related to the gradual diminishing of the national contingent in the Afghanistan TO, on the conclusion of Romania's participation in NATO (ISAF) operation as well as on the evolution of the security environment in Romanian contingent's area of responsibility. This is done by decreasing manpower, concluding the mission assigned to certain structures and redirecting some of the strength towards other contributions.

In this perspective, some of the Forward Operation Bases (FOB) in the Romanian manoeuvre battalions' area of responsibility are planned to be reshaped, closed and/or transferred. At the same time, the responsibilities and the area of operations of the manoeuvre battalion planned to be withdrawn will be taken over by the battalion that is planned to remain in Afghanistan.

Under the circumstances of the major changes that are to be made to the ISAF mission during 2013-2014, Romania was required and accepted to take over the ground defence area of Kandahar Airport (KAF FP GDA), starting with this January and also to introduce an infantry companysized detachment, so as to accomplish together with the 

![14_image_0.png](14_image_0.png)

![14_image_1.png](14_image_1.png)

American partner the main mission, that is securing this major objective in the RC-SOUTH AOR.

As a result of manpower downsizing by the end of 2013, the Romanian Armed Forces' contribution to ISAF operation is to be reduced namely to 1,200 militaries. In 2014, the gradual redeployment process of our national contribution will continue, while maintaining only the major structures and those required by the ISAF and the Afghan partners.

By engaging in diversified domains and tasks, according to ISAF's operational requirements and priorities, Romania responded to the international community effort in Afghanistan and we demonstrated that our approach is not based only on number of forces, but also on quality.

# The Romanian Armed Forces In Eu Operations

I
n 2013, Romania participates in five EU-led missions (EU EUFOR ALTHEA - Bosnia-Herzegovina operation, ATALANTA operation, Georgia - EUMM EU Mission, EUSEC - Security Support Mission in Democratic Republic of Congo and EUTM Mission in Mali) with 37 militaries in the EUFOR ALTHEA operation, 20 militaries in observation and mon itor i ng m iss i ons and 30 militaries in support and training missions.

As an EU member, Romania efficiently participates and supports the keeping of a stable and safe security environment (Safe and Stable Environment / SASE) in Bosnia and Herzegovina, supports the Capacity-Building and Training process of Bosnian Armed Forces and will contribute with an infantry c o mp a ny t o t h e Int e r m e d i at e Regional Reser ve (IRR). In the second term of the year, Romania will support the extension of the ATALANTA operation mandate, till 2014, and will continue monitoring the situation in Georgia, support and monitor the security missions in the D.R. of Congo as well as the Malian security forces (by training the local armed forces and by counselling the civilian administration).

2003 represents the beginning of Romania's contribution to EU operations. Romania participated with officers in CONCORDIA Operation in FYROM.

Since the EU assumed responsibility for operation ALTHEA, Romania reconfigured its participation to consist in a platoon of military police, one transport platoon and general staff officers in EUFOR Headquarters.

In 2005, an ALPHA detachement with about 40 troops with 4 IAR 330 SOCAT helicopters and one AN 26 aircraft attended ALTHEA Operation, executing approximately 175 missions in a total number of 400 flight hours.

NAVFOR ATALANTA was the first participation of a Romanian ship in a counter-piracy operation, but also the first presence of the Romanian Naval Forces in a mission in the Indian Ocean and the Southern Hemisphere.

The preparation of the EU NAVFOR ATALANTA mission was a complex process, both when speaking of training and logistics, which was initiated long before and involved all structures of the Naval Forces Staff. For the first time, we had a helicopter and a Special Operations Forces detachment onboard.

## Logistics-The Biggest Challenge

The biggest challenge in the process of training for mission was, however, the logistics. The long distance from the area of operation, the lack of support points or agreements in the area, the extreme climate added to the urgent needs to improve the combat capabilities of the ship, namely conducting the compulsory regular maintenance to part of its equipment. Given the fact that the full arming of the two Type 22 frigates during the last years has not been possible, the Romanian Naval Forces have made great efforts in purchasing and installing the new equipment needed for the mission accomplishment. Everybody's mobilization, from admiral to soldier, and the hours and days of intense activity led to the successful completion of the training for mission. Throughout the training period, technical maintenance works and complex works at one of the Olympus turbines, on the helicopter's onboard operating and stationing systems, on the communications systems, as well as on the propulsion system were performed. Also, new weaponry, communications or propulsion systems were installed onboard of the ship, mainly equipment that has gone through various testing stages on land or at sea. There was another "crew" that was being trained in the country ready to support the ship at logistic and diplomatic levels and in other contingency situations, throughout the mission. This "crew" successfully carried out its mission.

The reliability proven when preparing for mission, as well as the effectiveness of the new equipment and systems installed on board were demonstrated during the missions when the vessel was fully interoperable with the other vessels in the operating group. The presence of the helicopter, of the Special Forces and other support structures made from the Romanian ship an extremely helpful partner, able to act on an equal footing with these ships.

## Onboard Journal

On Wednesday, September 12th, *Regele Ferdinand* frigate left the port of Constanta in order to participate in the counter - piracy operation EU NAVFOR ATALANTA, in the Gulf of Aden and Somali Basin. After crossing the Bosphorus and Dardanelles, *Regele Ferdinand* frigate continued her voyage towards the first harbor for restoring the operational capacity and getting specialized training for counter-piracy operations, at the same time providing for informational support within Operation Active Endeavour, as well. Even if she didn't actually participate in Operation Active Endeavour in 2012, Regele *Ferdinand* frigate accomplished missions in support of this operation while transiting the Mediterranean Sea.

On Saturday, September 15, "Regele Ferdinand" frigate entered the port of Souda, in Crete, which is the second home for the frigate's crew. The frigate made a stop in this harbor during almost all the international missions she has taken part in since 2005, having onboard a sailor who worked at NMIOTC Center (NATO Maritime Interdiction Operational Training Center) from Souda for three years. The most important activity in Souda Harbor was the counter-piracy course organized at NMIOTC. This course was attended by the control team of the ship, the boarding team and the Special Operations Force (SOF) teams.

After transiting the Suez Channel-a first for a Romanian navy ship-on Tuesday, September 25th, *Regele Ferdinand* frigate sailed on the Red Sea on her way to the area of operation of EU NAVFOR ATALANTA. According to the national mandate, Regele *Ferdinand* frigate entered under the command of Navy EU NAVFOR, on Monday, October 1st. The command of the task force was insured by the Italian Rear-Admiral Enrico Credendino, embarked onboard ITS San Giusto.

The results of the mission are impressive:
•	 94 days of which 71 days at sea and 60 days in the EU NAVFOR Operation ATALANTA 2012
•	 17,844.9 nautical miles of which more than 12,500 nautical miles in the EU NAVFOR Operation ATALANTA 2012
•	 1660,52 underway hours of which more than 1,100 underway hours in the EU NAVFOR Operation ATALANTA 2012
•	 more than 113,11 flight hours for the Puma Naval helicopter
•	 seven replenishment of the helicopter at sea missions
•	 seven friendly approach missions and •	 a "Bravo Zulu" received from the EU NAVFOR
commander at the end of her mission.

The Romanian frigate went through three patrolling stages. 

The activities' difficulty level gradually increased and the sailors onboard of Regele *Ferdinand* frigate carried out the entire range of counter-piracy actions they had been trained for: 
surface and air reconnaissance missions, friendly approach missions, escorting a vessel in the World Food Program, ![17_image_1.png](17_image_1.png)

![17_image_0.png](17_image_0.png)

logistics support, monitoring the fishing activities off the Somali Coast, providing MEDEVAC by means of the Puma Naval helicopter, training the Tanzanian sailors, representing Romania in this part of the world through naval diplomatic actions in her ports of call and, maybe the most important mission, apprehending and detaining 9 suspect pirates.

The successful participation of *Regele Ferdinand* frigate in Operation Atalanta proves that the Romanian Naval Forces have a professional training system that meets NATO and EU personnel and capabilities-related standards and are able to carry out the pre-established missions and honor the national commitments thus actively contributing to the implementation of Romanian's security policy and to the accomplishment of National Security Strategy objectives. Mission accomplished!

## Special Ambassadors Of The Romanian Naval Forces

At the end of the mission, Rear Admiral Enrico Credendino, CTF 465 EU NAVFOR's Commander said: "I would like to express my congratulations for the very well done job in the Gulf of Aden and Somali Basin.  You have demonstrated your professionalism, motivation and commitment in every tactical situation. The contribution you have brought to the fight against piracy in this region has been appreciated by all involved in this common endeavor. You have accomplished all tasks assigned in a proficient and effective manner with your cooperative spirit and prompt attitude.  You are special ambassadors for the Romanian Navy…Fair winds and following seas!"
Operation EU NAVFOR ATALANTA was launched on December 8th, 2008 and is conducted in accordance with United Nations' Security Council resolutions. The Operation has been extended by the European Council until December 2014 and has the following objectives: protecting the vessels of the World Food Program (WFP), giving humanitarian aid and protecting the African Union's Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) transport ships; to help deter, prevent and repress acts of piracy and armed robbery; protecting vulnerable vessels and monitoring the fishing activities off the coast of Somalia.

# The Romanian Special Operations Forces A New Identity For An Old Caste

T
he Special Operations capabilities are versatile instrume nt s , h and l e d by t he Romanian political and military decision makers, for rapid, specialized and discreet intervention world-wide with the purpose of protecting strategic interests or managing asymmetric threats. This role is established by especially organized small units which employ adjusted equipment and tactics, generally applied unconventionally against strategic and/ or operational targets. 

The Romanian Special Operations Forces conduct six specific mission types, listed here and expanded below, as follows: (1) special reconnaissance, (2) direct actions, (3) military assistance, 
(4) counter-insurgency and counterterrorism, (5) maritime interdiction, and 
(6) "collateral missions".

The first mission set - "**special** 
reconnaissance" - incorporates all the tasks related to discreet or clandestine intelligence collection, at strategic distance or in hostile environment, aiming at the type of threats, their environment and t he p osit ive identification of threats' propagation vectors. Whether we talk about the "Special Mission Platoon" established in 1941, or the current capabilities, surveillance gear, vehicles, parachutes and underwater equipment are critical for a successful accomplishment of these missions. The official campaign logs are full of such successes gained during WWII against Russian and German forces, and presently, in the mountains of Afghanistan, against terrorist groups.

The second mission set - "direct actions" - consists of the raids, ambushes, physical destruction, terminal guidance of intelligent and similar ammunitions aimed at destroying, retrieving, capturing critical equipment, intelligence and/ or personnel. A cursory look in the history books would allow the reader to express his/her amazement to Vlad The Impeller's night attack against the Ottomans, using the enemy's uniforms in June, 1462, when he postponed the Turkish conquering campaign in the South-Eastern Europe. However, looking at the more recent history - from 2006 up to present - the Romanian SOF have captured tens of high value targets (HVTs) and conducted hundreds of such unilateral or partnered missions against the vectors threatening Afghanistan's stability and security. In the past, and today, such mission involved and still does a high degree of risk, thus frequently claiming the lives of even the best special operators.

The third mission set - "military assistance" - is the core competence of the Special Operations Forces. Whether this effort materializes through the deployment of instructor teams or through advise-and-assist presence, the net effect is the improvement of the assisted-nation's security environment and apparatus. Although words like "training" and "counseling" seem unglamorous, the Special Operators take on the task to build long-lasting institutions which become capable of managing their assigned territory, thus contributing to a peaceful and better tomorrow. The aspiration for a better tomorrow made the Romanian Special Operations support the nation building efforts in Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan (the last two ones being still active).

T h e f o u r t h m i s s i o n s e t - 
"**counter-insurgency (COIN) and** counter-terrorism" - consists of the 

![18_image_0.png](18_image_0.png)

strategies, tactics, forces, processes 

![19_image_0.png](19_image_0.png)

![19_image_1.png](19_image_1.png) and abilities required to manage domestic or external asymmetric threats or violent vectors intensified by political agendas. It is noteworthy that the Romanian COIN efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan have been rendered operational through military assistance efforts; this approach does not deny the importance of the mission, but takes into consideration these nations' needs to develop their own COIN strategies.

The fifth mission set - "maritime interdiction" - incorporates the tasks akin to the boarding and visitation of designated vessels breaching national sovereignty or disobeying United ![19_image_2.png](19_image_2.png)

in the Mediterranean Sea or off the Horn of Africa, the Romanian Naval Special Operations Forces have directly contributed to the national and regional stability and security - by participating in the European Union's operation, "ATALANTA" and the NATO-led one, "ACTIVE ENDEAVOUR".

The last, but not the least significant mission set - " **t h e c ol l ater a l** missions" - gathers together hostage rescue operations, counter-CBRN, counter-proliferation and any other strategic task no one else is capable of accomplishing. This last task is illustrative for the flexibility and skills which characterize these forces, and it provides the reason for which they have and of procedural and technological innovation. 

The old saying that reads "train for the known threats, but educate yourself for the unknown" is also the motto for the Romanian Special Operations educational strategy, for easily understandable reasons: not all threats are easily predictable, but SOF have to be ready to tackle them all!

As you might know, the Romanian historical sources are full of bravery deeds that match the current SOF tasks; these deeds also have in common, besides the heroic trait, the way the "special operators" were looked at as a special caste. Today, we have to accept that these "special" predecessors have done things differently, but obtained similar strategic effects, and in the end, that is what matters. In the future, SOF will be asked to accomplish similar critical tasks, and will use different technologies, procedures or even incorporate new missions and acquire new skills. As long as these cyclicallyre-branded forces aggressively "ride the wave of change", they'll always produce hundred-fold effects compared to the initial investment.

As for the near future, the Special Operations Forces will continue to be the multi-functional instrument that they are today, while addressing new, layered and modular command and control requirements, and reviewing the management policy that have turned them into what they are today - the "SILENT PROFESSIONALS".

# Special Rights For The 33,000 Romanian War Veterans

A
s a sign of recognition and appreciation of citizens' bravery and loyalty on the battlefield of WWI, the Romanian state provides special rights for veterans, disabled personnel and war widows. Our country keeps record of 33,000 war veterans, 1,500 disabled people and 140,000 war widows.

During the time, the legal framework has undergone successive modifications as a result of existing social and economic facts. 

The coordinating structure at the national level responsible for providing assistance to war veterans, wounded/disabled and war widows is the Quality of Life Directorate. The Directorate acts as an interface between the Ministry of National Defense and non-governmental associations of war veterans by maintaining a close dialogue with them and monitoring the way in which their problems are solved by the specific governmental institutions.

At the same time, Quality of Life Directorate took the necessary steps to improve the legal framework regulating their status so that the rights established for this category of ![23_image_1.png](23_image_1.png)

# Romanian Military Charity Association - "Comrades" - 5 Years Of Existence And Over 300 Severe Cases Solved

Romanian Military Charity Association –
"COMRADES", established in 2008, is focused on providing social and medical support to Romanian Armed Forces' personnel, especially to wounded, disabled and dependants of deceased military personnel in missions abroad.

The Association has over 15,000 members, both militaries and civilians, who voluntarily contribute to gather funds for charitable destination.

Under the motto *"Before all, we are human beings"*, the Association offered its support in solving of over 300 severe medical and social cases during its 5 years of existence.

Thus, the Association provided financial support for complicated surgical operations, medical devices acquisition, and social aid for diseases, natural disasters and for other activities organized in the memory of deceased comrades abroad.

Every month, the Association offers financial support to the pre-school children of the deceased military personnel killed in actions abroad; also, the Association annually organize, in cooperation with the Ministry of National Defense, at least two events (*1st June-Children' Day* and the Christmas Tree) dedicated to the children of the military personnel injured or killed in actions abroad.

As a matter of fact, the Association is considered to be a main non-governmental partner of the Ministry of National Defence on social issues. The Association was recognized as being of public utility by the Romanian Government for its exceptional activity which complements the efforts of the military institution.

# From Cincu Range To The Land Forces Combat Training Center

T
he necessity of training the Land Forces' troops in a unified context that would allow the homogenization of the structures in accordance with the established standards led five years ago to the establishment of what we all know today as the "GETICA" Combat Training Center of the Land Forces (CTC-LF in English or CIL-FT in Romanian).

CTC - as any new institution –
required the constitution of a nucleus of personnel with special training skills, besides the development of the existing infrastructure in the Cincu Range. In this context, the short but rich in events history of the CTC can be looked at from the perspective of the development stages established in 2006, once the Concept of organization and functioning of the unit has appeared. 

The first phase meant the initiation of the establishment process of the Center and started in 2006. The second phase, which lasted between 2007 and 2008, consisted in establishing the CTC
personnel core made up of militaries gathered from different structures of the LF Staff and the reception of the first simulation equipment. The next phase, the third, in which the intermediate operational capabilities were achieved, consisted in training the personnel, increasing the amount of simulation equipment and last 

![25_image_0.png](25_image_0.png) but not least, creating an adequate infrastructure. This phase started in 2009 and was finalized in 2012. 

CTC, as a structure specialized in the troops' training makes available to the beneficiaries a series of capabilities that can be grouped in four general domains, as follows: human resources, simulation systems, infrastructure and training programs. Therefore the training unit would execute its activities in a modern infrastructure (FOBs, adequate accommodation facilities, buildings designated for the coordination and conduct of the exercises, computer network, the possibility of connecting to INTRAMAN and MILNET, etc) and benefits from the CTC specialized personnel's skills, which includes O/Cs, exercise planning structure, OPFOR, live and constructive simulation. All these personnel resources are made available to the units that are to be trained in a large array of training packages, the most relevant being LTP (Leader Training Program), TLP (Troop Leading Procedures), C-IED (Counter IED), TOP (Tactical Orientation Program).

For the future, the ambitions of the CTC include the development of the existing training packages, and the inclusion of a series of other programs that will meet the current needs and requirements. Packages as NEST - Negotiation and Engagement Skills Training - will be an added value for the Center and will contribute to achieving the training objectives of the Land Forces' units.

## Training For Afghanistan In Cincu And Cârţisoara

The "GETICA" Combat Training Center of the Land Forces, continuing in the tradition of Cincu Artillery and Armor Training Range is also known for its two ranges, Cincu and Cartisoara, where generations of soldiers trained along the years; by means of live fire, experimental fire 

![26_image_0.png](26_image_0.png)

with all the categories of armaments 

![26_image_1.png](26_image_1.png) that equip the infantry, artillery and armor units and formations. 

Looking back, we can say without false modesty that the achievements of the CTC Cincu are measured by the 21  Mission Rehearsal Exercises (MREs) for the Afghanistan Theater of Operations, of which 4 with Operational Mentoring and Liaison Teams (OMLT), two MREs for Iraq, 3 High Intensity Conflict (HIC) training exercises other than stability and support, 5  joint exercises with the United States Air Force-Europe (USAFE) and 71st Air Flotilla, and 2 National Joint-type exercises ran by the General Staff.

Land Forces Simulation Training Center "Getica" from Cincu provides the proper conditions so that the units can "train as they will fight" in a live simulated environment simulating the battle conditions.

Applying knowledge gained by exposure to simulation is the main purpose of constructive simulation training. Simulation replicates situations that are made available to the troops in order to practice and develop the necessary skills, before operating in a real environment where "do it or die" mentality can often make the soldiers unconfident and nervous.

The special contribution brought to the forces' training process is completed by the role given to the Center as part of the Lessons Learned process, which consists in the Take Home Package
(THP) made up of all documents, captures from the simulation systems, pictures and recordings made during the exercises.

Looking towardsthe future,we can say that the CTC helps the implementation of the strategic development plan until 2025, with objectives distributed in fiveyear stages. The desired End State for 2025 is that CTC would become the National Training Center for Tactical Units at Brigade/Battalion level for the Land Forces.

In order to achieve the final goal, the specific activities for our current stage are: 
•	 training the troops in Full Spectrum Operations (FSOs) at the same time with the MREs for the units that are 

![27_image_0.png](27_image_0.png)

participating in the international missions in Afghanistan and other conflict areas in the world, under UN or NATO aegis;
•	 training the leaders at brigade/
battalion level for conducting FSOs, using modern simulation systems
•	 continuing the partnership with JRMC Hohenfels, Germany, for joint training, and increasing collaboration with similar Centers from NATO state members
•	 becoming a Center for Excellency in the Romanian Armed Forces, in the field of operational training. This history rich in events, as we stated in the beginning of the article, is the fruit of the intense activity of the CTC that included a series of sacrifices, but also meant the development of special relationships with our collaborators and partners from different echelons, and with the local community. The very good relationship of the CTC with the local authorities is a medium term objective. Activities like "Open Gates Day" organized by the unit to relate to the local community are an important point on the working agenda of our institution. Collaboration with the school and the City Hall of Cincu village got materialized in the organization of significant events like: the Romanian Armed Forces Day, War Veterans Day, Heroes Day, Open Gates Day, etc. CTC has expressed a real interest in the problems of the local community, offering its unconditional support in times of need.

Multinational exercise "Saber Guardian 13", a demonstration of CTC's capabilities Conducted for the first time in Romania, the Exercise brought together over 150 militaries from 10 countries.

Romanian Land Forces Staff, EUCOM and USAREUR organized this kind of exercise in Romania for the first time at the Land Forces Combat Training Center from Cincu.

![27_image_1.png](27_image_1.png)

The multinational exercise **"SABER** 

![28_image_0.png](28_image_0.png)

GUARDIAN 13" took place at Land Forces Combat Training Center, Cincu, from 15th to 25th of April, 2013.

Ten countries participated in this exercise: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Moldova, Poland, Serbia, Ukraine, Romania and USA. Two officers from Hungary and Belgium participated as observers at this exercise. The total number of the participants was 151. 

The exercise goal was training the commanders and the personnel in planning and executing multinational Peace Support Operations based on the current operational environment, improving the staff procedures and standards using the standardized reports, orders and briefings and training the military personnel using the JCATS simulating sistems.

The main purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate/verify the efficiency of the Romanian Land Forces Combat Training Center's capabilities and promoted it as main force training facility in a multinational environment. 

The exercise scenario is built on Peace Support Operation-type. The concept of operation, scenario and Main Event were set up by Land Forces Staff, CTC and USAREUR specialists. 

The EXCON consisted mainly of representatives from Land Forces Staff, CTC and USAREUR and 2nd Craiova Infantry Brigade. The exercise had 2 co-directors (one from Romania and the other one from USA). The invited countries' manned the multinational brigade headquarters (HICON) and the Response Cells.

 The main training audience was a mixed Romanian - American batalion staff. This batalion was staffed with personnel from 26th "Red Scorpions" Infantry Batalion (Craiova, Romania), a unit that has gained its experience in the theaters of operations from Iraq and Afghanistan, and from a similar battalion from USA. 

The technical support for the exercise (JCATS systems, computers, radios and other equipment) and the personnel were provided by the Land Forces CTC.

The execution of "SABER GUARD-IAN 13" exercise at the Land Forces CTC contributed to the strengthening of the bilateral, regional and strategic partnerships.

"The virtual and live computer-assisted exercise, mutually hosted by Romania and USA, was a first. We intend to continue, extend and diversify it in the future", declared the deputy chief of the Land Forces Staff, Major General Mircea Savu, at the end of Saber Guardian 13. He also added that: "The Combat Training Center of the Land Forces (CTC-LF) is of outmost importance for the training of the LF militaries, the center being equipped with the necessary facilities needed train units scheduled to participate in missions in the theaters of operations but also the other units participating in national and multinational operations. The infrastructure and equipment used are modern and are continuously modernized, the center's personnel is very well trained with militaries that participated in missions in the theaters of operations at training stages in the US training centers from Germany or at various training programs outside the national borders".

In his turn, Major General James Boozer, deputy chief USAREUR
declared that: "I was honored to be in Cincu. Saber Guardian 13 was multinational training exercise of broad scope. You cannot conduct such an exercise overnight, you need a lot of training, planning and teamwork. We will continue work with the Romanian partners not only in the CTC-LF but also in our training centers. Next year we'll train together with the Bulgarian and Ukrainian troops. Our vision and intention is to create a connection among these exercises. Each of us benefitted from the other one's experience, and we acted as a whole, in the end. Cooperation and interoperability are very important. We fought together in Iraq and Afghanistan and such an exercise helps us face the future challenges."

# Nato Humint Centre Of Excellence From Oradea

T
ransformation in NATO i mpl i e s , among ot he rs , the fol l o w i n g a r e a s : concept development and experimentation, military intelligence, training (according to NATO doctrine and standard procedures) as well as the research for and integration of *future* concepts. 

NATO's Centers of Excellence, with their necessary means and expertise, come to meet NATO's need of capability development, their establishment in niche areas being encouraged. 

In the early 21st century, NATO faced an increasing challenge in asymmetric warfare and the development of HUMINT was considered critical. The establishment of a new organization was required in order to provide the Alliance with sound support in the HUMINT
area, comprehensively covering the transformation pillars - analysis & lessons learned doctrine & standardization, concept development & experimentation and education & training.

## Why Romania?

The NATO Military Authorities Intelligence Coordination Group  - NMAICG identified shortfalls in creating a NATO HUMINT functional capability and understood that a coherent and structured approach from the Allied nations was required in order to overcome these difficulties. 

Following a close cooperation with other NATO HUMINT capabilities in the theatres of operations from Kosovo, Bosnia and later Iraq and Afghanistan, Romania developed at that time an articulate structure that included 

![29_image_0.png](29_image_0.png)

![29_image_1.png](29_image_1.png) experimented military personnel. Furthermore, The Romanian Defense Intelligence General Directorate started building specific national capabilities and actively participated in relevant coordination groups.

## Hcoe - International Military Organization

In t h e c ompl e x pro c e s s of the C ent re's establishment and accreditation, important steps have been taken in the issuing of the framework documents: the *Concept* of the Centre of Excellence- which clearly states the mission, tasks and the vision on developing the Institution as pillar of HUMINT transformation within NATO and the Operational and Functional Memoranda of Understanding (which sets up the functional guidelines for the center). These documents were signed by the Allied Command Transformation

# The Centenary Of The Romanian Military Aeronautics

2 0th April, 2013 marks one hundred years since the *Law on the military aeronautics organization* was issued. After this law was passed, aeronautics became a formal concept, and thus a scientific contribution equal in importance to any other major Romanian invention for it allowed the accomplishment of a century-old dream that is to be free and fly like the birds. 

In accordance with this law, "the purpose of the military aeronautics service is to study and promote interest in the design and use of air navigation devices with possible applications in the military field. In addition, the service is concerned with managing and mobilizing the units within this service, as well as training its personnel".

Compressed in just a few, yet carefully chosen words, the initiator of this law forged under the term of "aeronautics" all the aspects inherent to building airships and performing flight activities: scientific research, manufacturing industry, airship operator, activity coordination, as well as training of aeronautic personnel. Such a comprehensive approach proved beneficial, as three months after the law was issued, our country, despite the poor resources available in 1913, managed to introduce a new service onto the battlefield during the Second Balkan War. 

This would not have been possible, however, without the previous contributions of the Romanian researchers, whose pioneering activities are acknowledged worldwide. In 1893, the first military air-station unit equipped with captive balloons was established. Also, it was only after Traian Vuia's first successful flight in 1906, which coincided with the birth of the Romanian Aviation, and Aurel Vlaicu's first takeoff in 1910, which marked the beginnings of the Military Aviation when airplanes started to be used as part of the training process during military maneuvers. The industry took off, with airships being produced and assembled in our country, the next natural step being the foundation of the first military aviation school. A few flight instructors (second lieutenant Ştefan Protopopescu, lieutenant Mircea Zorileanu, 

![31_image_0.png](31_image_0.png)

![31_image_1.png](31_image_1.png) second lieutenant Gheorghe Negrescu, and second lieutenant Nicolae Capşa) had already obtained their flight license at the school of Mihail Cerchez, founded in 1910 in Chitila, and the school of Prince George Valentin Bibescu, established in 1911 in Cotroceni. On 1st April 1912, the Royal Decree no.1953 was issued, and thus, the Military Pilot School in Cotroceni came into being. A month later, on 5th May 1912, at the initiative of Prince George Valentin Bibescu, the National Air League was created. Its role was to support the development of the Romanian aviation, which also included the purchase of military airplanes.

## New Law, New Branch

Given this context, the Law on the military aeronautics organization, which came into effect in 1913, greatly contributed to the efforts aimed at creating a new branch which was about radically changing the way in which military operations were conducted. The law established Military Aeronautics as a well-structured organization, with specialized bodies for aviation and air-station and a central activity area with personnel, school, aircrafts, as well as necessary resources. The Engineer Inspector General was assigned as the head of the Military Aeronautics Service, later on called the Engineer and Military Aeronautics Inspector General. The law also included provisions related to future educational developments, according to which upon allocation of resources, new aviation and air-station units were to be created and attached to each army corps in the citadel of Bucharest, the military regions and any other reinforced position. Thus, a first doctrine for the Military Aeronautics was taking shape, based on which aviation and air-station resources were decentralized and assigned to important structures of the armed force.

Moreover, the Law on the military aeronautics organization stipulated the creation of the Permanent

# The Romanian Naval Forces On Mission At Seas And Oceans Worldwide

T
he Naval Forces are designed to protect and promote the interests and sovereign rights of Romania, at sea and on the river, independently or together with other forces under NATO and EU command, by conducting the operations in the area of responsibility, at sea and from sea to land, on the Danube as well as in the lagoon area. 

## Organization

The Romanian Naval Forces are structured on four pillars in order to be able to perform their tasks. The first pillar, the Fleet Command, includes the Frigates Flotilla and the Helicopter Group, corvettes squadron, MCM vessels, missile fast patrol boats (at sea) and the River Flotilla with its monitors squadron, gunboats and river patrol boats in the river area.

The second pillar consists of separate specialized structures, directly subordinated to the Naval Forces Staff, such as: the Diving Center, the Radio Electronic and Surveillance Center, the Maritime Hydrographic Directorate, the Marine Infantry Battalion, the Support Battalion, the IT Centre, the Training, Simulation and Evaluation Centre, the Naval Medicine Center.

The third pillar is made up of the Naval Forces' Logistic Structures,

![33_image_0.png](33_image_0.png) and its subordinated structures: the Special Purpose Ships Squadron, Naval Technical Maintenance Center as well as the Logistics Departments.

The fourth pillar is the military naval educational system and it includes "Mircea cel Bătrân" Naval Academy, "Amiral Ion Murgescu" Navy Petty Officers School as well as "Vice Amiral Constantin Bălescu" Naval Training School. 

## The Naval Forces' International Activity

The Naval Forces have had a full international agenda throughout the recent years. The participation of *Regele* Ferdinand as well as *Regina Maria* frigates in the Active Endeavour UNIFIED PROTECTOR Operation in the Mediterranean Sea and Operation ATALANTA in the Indian Ocean, the participation of the Marine Infantry operations, and the participation in the BLACKSEAFOR Naval Cooperation Task Group in the Black Sea, the local drills and training exercises with NATO member states' ships, training voyages of "Albatros" transport vessel, and training voyages of Mircea School Ship have been complex activities performed during the last years with good results, thanks to the efforts of all crew members.

## The Romanian Marines Train With

the American ones each year The Marine Infantry Battalion is unique in the Naval Forces as well as in the Romanian Armed Forces through the specific missions they carry out: deterring and annihilating terrorist actions in the Danube Delta, the lagoon area and on the river. Their other missions involve surveying and protecting the naval communication channels, transport missions, participating in peace support operations (PSO), first aid assistance given in civilian emergencies, as well as limiting and eliminating the effects of disasters and other crisis situations.

Over 700 Romanian and American militaries participated in Summer Storm 2012 exercise in August, in *Capu* Midia Training Range. The Romanian Marine Infantry militaries and their American partners trained together for the planning and execution of a disembarking operation on the Romanian territory by conducting beach reconnaissance and securing, patrolling, infantry shooting, evacuating the non-combatant population, training for urban fight and combat reconnaissance operations.

In May 2012, 75 militaries of the 307th Marine Infantry Battalion participated in the Drill module for peacekeeping and counterinsurgency operations conducted throughout BLACK SEA ROTATIONAL FORCE 
12 exercise. A detachment of U.S. 

Marines Corps instructors as well as an infantry detachment from Azerbaijan participated in the drill. The Romanian Marines, together with the Americans and the Azerbaijanis ones trained with the Marine Infantry group/platoon for urban operations, cordon and search operations, countering improvised explosive devices and installing and operating traffic control checkpoints, for two weeks. Health education topics were included in the schedule, with emphasis on first aid giving and the evacuation and transport of the wounded personnel on the battlefield.

## The Diving Center Of The Naval Forces, A Pole Of Excellence In The Black Sea Area

The military divers have constantly proven their professionalism, value of the Diving Center was recognized both at national and international levels through its 35 years of experience, many divingrelated accomplishments, starting with the records set in the '80s with saturation diving at 500 meters and continuing with civilian works on the Black Sea oil rigs and at the hydroelectric power plants all over the country and the nuclear power plant in Cernavoda.

The Diving Center covers a wide range of security services which meet both national and Allied interests. International exercises such as Eurasian Partnership Dive 2012, MCM Livex Poseidon 12, and Summer Storm 12 prepared the navy divers for their participation along with the allies in theaters of operations from Afghanistan and the Indian Ocean ("Atalanta"). The militaries from the Naval Special Operations Group and EOD structures are on "standby", ready to accomplish any tasks assigned by the NATO Response Force. 

An extremely important component of the center is the Deep Sea Divers Group, who went through a complex training module which ended with a saturation dive at 180 meters. 

The training, professionalism and desire to succeed of the Romanian navy divers helped them reach a level of excellence which, together with the best equipment, placed them in an elite group at international level and made them extremely important players in this field, in the Black Sea area. 

Specialized structures within the Diving Center carry out certification activities for civilian companies which work with divers on the Romanian territory, the Center being the national authority in professional diving.

## Mircea **School Ship, The Symbol** 

![34_Image_0.Png](34_Image_0.Png) Of The Romanian Navy

Built between 1938 and 1939 in the Blohm und Woss shipyard in Hamburg, Germany, *Mircea* is the fourth ship of a series of five similar ships built in the same shipyard. "Eagle" (former Horst Wessel)-USA, "Gorch Foch I"
(former Tovarisch, former Gorch Fochmuseum ship) - Germany, "Gorch Foch II" - Germany, "Sagres" (former Albert Leo Schlageter) - Portugal are her other sister ships.

2009 was a very important year for the *Mircea* School Ship. The ship celebrated her 70th anniversary with dignity and noblesse. At this age, the ship was in an exceptional technical and maintenance shape, which could be seen during a voyage on the Black Sea, the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, when the port of calls were Catania (Sicily-Italy), Cadiz (Spain), Tenerife (Canary Islands - Spain), Hamilton (Bermuda Islands), Charleston (South Carolina - USA), Boston (Maryland - USA.), Ponta Delgada (Azore Islands - Portugal) 
and Mellila. On this occasion, *Mircea* participated in the "*TALL SHIPS* CHALLENGE 2009" Regatta and in the 
"*SAIL BOSTON"* Festival. 

This year we celebrate 74 years since the commissioning of the ship in the Romanian Naval Forces. Over 70 classes of Romanian sailors made their apprenticeship on board *Mircea*, became one with the school ship and made the Romanian Navy famous worldwide.

Mircea School Ship is a genuine ambassador of the Romanian Naval Forces and of the Romanian people in the world. It is a school where the character, trust and solidarity of the Romanian sailors are strengthened.

# The National Defence Industry - A Main Player In The Romanian Armed Force'S Procurement Process

Department for Armaments considers that the defence industry must play an important part in maintaining the operational capability at required standards for the armament systems and equipment used by the Services. 

The specific requirements for providing life-cycle operative logistic support and the necessity of having secure supply chains substantiate the measures taken in order to strengthen cooperation between the Ministry of National Defence contracting authorities and the domestic defence industry. The available contracting tools are stipulated by the legislation in the field which has the necessary leverages to turn this collaboration into good-quality products and services for the benefitting Services.

Three major research and development-related projects were initiated during the past years by the Department for Armaments: Assault weapon, caliber 5.56 mm with its specific ammunition, 8x8 Armored Personnel Carrier and the Unmanned Air and/or Ground Platforms.

The Armored Personnel Carrier (APC) is one of the priority acquisition programs of the MoND and a product designated to support the troops participating in the theaters of operations, the project being initiated by ROMARM National Company at Moreni Factory. The development and manufacturing of such equipment is a very good solution for Romania; the APC is to be produced for the Romanian Armed Forces, with the possibility to export it. The advantages of producing such equipment are huge, the MoND specialists controlling the technological process and the maintenance for the entire life-cycle of the product at controllable and reasonable costs.

![35_image_0.png](35_image_0.png)

Another priority project to be developed is the 5,56 mm assault rifle manufactured at Cugir Factory. Three weapons that are currently in experimental or prototype stage have been produced. These are currently being tested by the Research Agency for Military Equipment and Technologies (RAMET).

The third project is the research mini UAV that was initiated by RAMET. Since there is a collaboration for the mini UAV at national level, we organized a meeting with the other institutions from the national defense and public order system.

The projects-related activities are approached in accordance with the collaboration agreements between the Department for Armaments and the Ministry of Economy (MOE) as part of the Ministry of National Defense (MoND) Research and Development Sectorial Plan (RDSP). 

An inter-institutional working group made up of representatives from the Ministry of Economy, Ministry of National Defence, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Romanian Intelligence Service has been established. The representatives will discuss the substantiation, development and monitoring of the Ministry of Economy's RDSP-related tasks in order to expand the collaboration relationships in the research & development field. 

At the same time, the Department for Armaments wants to achieve the technologic transfer to domestic defence industry factories for the prototype products built in the MoND research & development units as stipulated in the Strategy for turning profitable the R&D activities conducted by the MoND research & development units.

The Department for Armaments supports the economic operators of the domestic defence industry to homologate their new manufactured military equipment so that it can offer these products domestically (in the procurement procedures initiated by the MoND) and internationally, in accordance with the NATO and EU standards and Romanian Armed Forces requirements which stipulate the stimulation of the national defence industry.

Thus, the procurement requirements of the Romanian Armed Forces, the testing, evaluation, analysis and technical audit for the products' homologation as well as the identification of the best solutions for equipment 

![36_image_0.png](36_image_0.png)

maintenance are presented during INFODAY, an event we plan to organize annually and invite domestic producers of armaments systems and major equipment.

Another possibility to strengthen collaboration with the defence industry is the participation of the economic operators in the joint NATO/EU programs according to Smart Defence and *Pooling and Sharing* principles as well as the employment of double-utilization technologies.

To conclude with, the Ministry of National Defence considers that the national defence industry must be the main provider for the Romanian Armed Forces and acts accordingly in order to ensure its contribution and provide the maintenance to the armaments systems and major equipment throughout their life-cycle at the same time supporting the promotion of the national industry products both domestically and internationally.

## "Henri Coandă" Air Force Academy - Braşov: Extended Cooperation Within Erasmus Programme

"Henri Coandă" Air Force Academy is one of the Romanian Higher Education institutions that has become distinct not only due to its unique specializations, but also due to its valuable inherited tradition. The institution followed the international standards related to curricular projection by implementing the stipulations of Bologna Convention and providing training in the following fields of expertise: Aviation Management, Organization Management and Air Traffic Management. Moreover, 

![38_image_0.png](38_image_0.png)

![38_image_1.png](38_image_1.png)

the Academy manifested openness towards multicultural relationships, as required by the Bologna Convention, connecting itself to the national and international scientific circuit through collaborations with similar institutions from Romania and other EU and NATO member states. Whereas the first inter-institutional and intercultural dialogues implied visits and openness in terms of intentions, mobility has become manifest mainly for the last fifteen years. Consequently, a number of students from the "Henri Coandă" Air Force Academy studied at higher education institutions from Greece, Japan and the United States of America.

For the last two years the Academy has extended its international collaborations for students mobilities through the Erasmus programme, under the "Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency" (EACEA), aiming to accomplish its objectives of training the Romanian officer as a specialist and a citizen permanently integrated and adjusted to European and Euro-Atlantic structures and realities.

## Exchange Of Teaching Staff

In parallel with the students' mobility, special attention was paid by the "Henri Coandă" Air Force Academy to the academic staff mobility, in the light of implementing new teaching/learning systems and increasing the institutional visibility among its European partners. Such mobilities allowed for the development of specific partnerships for common scientific research projects. In this respect, the Academy has so far signed collaboration agreements with the Defense University of Brno, the Czech Republic and with the "General M.R. Stefanik" Armed Forces Academy of Liptovský Mikulás, Slovakia.

The openness toward international collaboration has been accomplished as well through visits, signing of collaboration protocols or through carrying out of scientific events with a broad international visibility. Throughout the previous academic year, the academy received the visit of many international delegations. The number of institutional collaboration agreements increased, "Henri Coandă" Air Force Academy having signed protocols with the Turkish Air Force Academy from Istanbul, with the "General Tadeusz Kosciuszko" Land Forces Academy from Wroclaw, Poland and Air Force Academy, Poland. Based on these agreements, the Academy has planned to receive the visit of two professors from the Turkish Air Force Academy and of one professor from the Slovak Armed Forces Academy. The professors will also perform didactic activities at "Henri Coandă" Air Force Academy. Added to this form of collaboration, the accomplished exchanges and agreements of the "Henri Coandă" Air Force Academy are carried out in collaboration with the European Air Force Academies (EUAFA) partners from countries including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Portugal, Sweden, Spain etc.

## "Mircea Cel Bătrân" Naval Academy

from Constanţa: Romanian students at naval universitites from Spain, Italy and Turkey Navy education components are well structured and have more than a century-old tradition, last year celebrating 140 years of naval education in Romania, but at the same time, they are among the most modern educational institutions in Romania.

![39_image_0.png](39_image_0.png)

"Mircea cel Bătrân" Naval Academy is an accredited military institution of higher specialized technical education which trains specialists for the needs of the Naval Forces and the Border Police, the shipping companies, and naval and harbor businesses.

During the recent years the international activities of the institution have experienced an unprecedented development, in accordance with the need for continuous upgrading of the curricula, educational infrastructure and teachers' scientific background.

If in 2007, we had only five cooperation agreements with the European shipping companies and no agreement with a university within the maritime field for the initiation of Erasmus placements, today the Academy has partnerships with six European higher education institutions (and 4 more agreements about to be finalized) and over 30 shipping companies.

The first teacher's exchanges (with the naval academies in Bulgaria and Turkey) and the first study mobility for students of the Merchant Navy Faculty took place in the academic year 2012-2013. Four students from the Engineering and Naval and Harbor Management Specialty studied at the University College in Alesund, Norway and four other students from Navigation and Maritime and River Transport Specialty, respectively Naval Electromechanics studied at "Piri Reis" University in Istanbul. 

Also, due to the "Military Erasmus" mobility program, two students from the Military Naval Faculty completed one semester at "Escuela Naval Military" in Marin, Spain, other two students completing a two-week training module at the Naval Academy in Livorno, Italy, in the field of International Maritime Law.

The Naval Academy aims to award 18 study grants and send 24 teachers to teach in foreign partner universities in the next academic year. Also, after signing the Erasmus partnerships, the Naval Academy prepares to host 12  international students and 24 foreign teachers and administrative staff to teach and be trained at "Mircea cel Bătrân" Naval Academy next year.

## The Military Technical Academy From Bucharest: Special Colaboration With The Military Schools From Saint-Cyr

The Military Technical Academy is an accredited military higher-education institution which fulfils, in its fields of competence, education and scientific research missions. It is here that engineer officers are trained for the national 

![39_image_1.png](39_image_1.png)

defense, public order and security system, and engineers for the defense industry.

The academy promotes the European dimension of the education and scientific research system by participating in European Union programs and partnerships with military and civilian universities through student, teacher and other administrative staff mobility, including the joint qualification programs.

As part of the cooperation with higher-education military institutions, one should emphasize the reciprocity-based cooperation with the Special Military Schools of Coetquidan - Saint Cyr, by means of scientific research stages for the development of the diploma papers for the French cadets, and by military training stages for the Romanian students. Since the initiation of this program in 2003, 128 Romanian students and 37 French cadets have benefited from these educational and training stages in the two universities.

Starting with the academic year 2000-2001, the Military Technical Academy has been participating in the European ERASMUS Program, whose objective is to contribute through promoting *Long Life Learning* to the development of the European Union as an advanced knowledge based society. 365 students, 75 teachers and researchers have benefited from mobility within this program. At the same time, 78 students and 32 teachers of partner universities have completed educational and teaching stages in the Military Technical Academy.

For outstanding results achieved within this program, the General Director for Education and Culture of the European Commission awarded the Military Technical Academy the
"Erasmus University Charter" in March 2003 and, in 2007, the "Extended Erasmus University Charter".

Currently, the academy has signed 35 partnerships with

# Ministry Of 

![41_Image_0.Png](41_Image_0.Png) National Defence Social Media

A
t the beginning of August 2012, the Ministry of National Defence (MoND) created its official Facebook, Twitter and You Tube e-mail accounts due to the need to communicate and send the information and the significant increase of the online traffic. 

This measure contributes to a correct and timely information of the external and internal public with regard to the military environment evolutions, to a better awareness of the Romanian Armed Forces' missions and role as well as to the promotion of the military fundamental principles, military profession and career but also to the interaction with the MoND audience in order to get an adequate feedback.

Social Media is a media complementary course of action, whether controlled or not, which supports the event-based communication with the community and the information propagation in environments less accessible to the other already employed communication channels.

Also, Social Media ensures the transmission of information in an environment inaccessible to the classical communication channels/means. The dialogue with the young people-some of the most important members of the network-about military environment-related subjects, contributes to the promotion and launching of certain MoND on-line events, operations, exercises, activities and services. **Very important in the current economic context**: 
you can cheaply and efficiently communicate by means of these social media networks, the e-mail accounts on these sites focusing on a close collaboration with the traditional media products of the MoND.

The main topics approached by the MoND Social Media Team are the training activities and missions conducted by the Romanian militaries, historical and cultural events, life and career stories but also activities of common interest for the community.

The communication within the social media networks allows the Romanian militaries to have a continuous support, regardless of the space, time or distance, and gives the audience the opportunity to read facts, latest news, films, documentaries and photos which spotlight the participation of our militaries in domestic or abroad missions. 

The MoND social media networks can be accessed by everybody and address not only to the domestic public but also to the external one (the militaries' families, the retired and reserve personnel and the community).

The MoND social media accounts are: - https://www.facebook.com/mapn.ro - http://www.youtube.com/mapnromania - http://twitter.com/mapnromania Also, the main leaders of the organization, the Minister of National Defence and the chief of General Staff created their own Facebook accounts which allow them to interact with their audience. Through this interaction, besides their public statements on different topics related to the military organization, our leaders discuss these topics together with the audience interested in the social media page and instantly 
- http://www.facebook.com/ministrul.apararii.nationale - http://www.facebook.com/sef.stat.major.general answer the emerging issues and questions.

The MoND created its Facebook account in the English language also with a view to promoting the Romanian militaries' participation in the NATO, UN or EU-led missions but also to informing the foreign public with regard to the training and missions performed by the Romanian militaries.
