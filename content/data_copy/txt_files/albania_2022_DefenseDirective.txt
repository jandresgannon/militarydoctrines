**MINISTRY OF DEFENSE OF THE REPUBLIC OF ALBANIA**

**DEFENSE DIRECTIVE 2022**


-----

**Introduction**

The strategic environment today is characterized by the era of strategic competition where the
aggressiveness of traditional threats intertwines with new hybrid, environmental, technological and
information threats, causing serious challenges and concerns to the security.
The Western Balkans region, despite being on the path to Euro-Atlantic integration, remains fragile
and under constant external pressure as a result of the growing influence of Russia and China. The
Republic of Albania, despite the security granted by the status of being a NATO member country, is
not immune to the security risks and threats.
These trends are expected to continue and will potentially be central as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic. In order to respond to the risks and threats, as well as the unpredictable dynamics of the
security environment, timely and reliable information, interaction between security and intelligence
structures, development of information defense technology, modern capabilities and active military
diplomacy are required.
2021 was an important year for Albania, the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces. We ensured
the protection of our citizens, cooperated with the allies and partners in conflict prevention, as well as
addressed common challenges, directed the national response to civil emergencies, and supported the
response to the pandemic. We are proud and grateful to all the military and civilian personnel in the
Armed Forces, who have worked tirelessly in the service towards the nation.
2022 will continue to be challenging, and require continual adaptation of our defense policy,
capabilities and force structure, which will enable us to deal with unpredictable situations. We will
continue to transform the way we operate, in terms of ensuring the security and defense of the country,
defending our Euro-Atlantic interests, engaging proactively in international operations, supporting our
foreign policy goals, and providing capabilities and emergency support.
In this regard, the work outcomes for 2022, in which we will measure our success, include:

-  The improvement of the financial treatment, conditions, and health care for the military

personnel and their families, as well as their integration into society after their transition to the reserve
status;

-  The modernization through the equipment of the Armed Forces with the necessary capacities to

face future challenges;

-  The education, consolidation of the reform in the Armed Forces Academy, as well as the

commencement of the projects for an Academy and a Defense College of high standards;

-  The risk reduction stemming from disasters and emergency situations, as well as strengthening

the specialized civil defense capabilities in the Armed Forces;

-  The proactive contribution to the regional operations and engagements;

-  The cyber security of our military systems;

-  Increase of the defense capabilities, through technology and innovation.

As the Minister of Defense, I am confident that the structures of the Ministry of Defense and those of
the Armed Forces will successfully achieve the planned objectives, offering maximum commitment in
the implementation of these important projects for the country and the society.

**5.** **Cyber Defense:**
The main focus in this domain, is ensuring the cyber security of military systems, through
securing the information infrastructures, strengthening the technological tools and building a
secure cyber environment with the required professional capacities in the field of information
security.

The necessary mechanisms for information security in cyberspace should be developed, taking
advantage of the benefits of information technology, as well as promoting national and
international cooperation in the field of cyber security.

The Military Cyber Security Unit, in cooperation with the strategic partners, shall achieve its
full operational capabilities.

**6.** **Consolidation of Civil Defense System**
The Civil Defense System aims at reducing the risk of disasters, ensuring the lives of people, properties,
cultural heritage and protecting the environment. Adapting bylaws remains a priority, as well as drafting
and implementing the strategic documents for civil protection. Meeting the objectives should be a priority
to fulfill the conditions in the framework of the membership of European Civil Protection Mechanism, as
well as to establish the National Training Center for Civil Protection. The local government units should
be supported and coordinated with, to improve their infrastructure investments,, in the framework of
preventive and mitigation measures, for the damage which might be caused by disasters.

**7.** **International engagement and cooperation**

**7.1 International Cooperation: Interoperability in the international framework shall start with our role**
in the NATO context, cooperation with close allies, as well as strategic goals and primary objectives of
Albanian foreign policy. NATO and the EU have launched a process of strategic adaptation, in the
framework of which the national contribution is closely and fundamentally linked to the strong Atlantic
approach that our country has.

NATO is and remains our main point of reference, regarding the common values, prevention,
deterrence, and defense. The Ministry of Defense shall be committed to supporting the Alliance's
adaptation to current and future security risks and challenges, maintaining a comprehensive approach
taking into account all types of threats, in all areas and in all strategic directions, with the focus in the
southern flank, as areas of national strategic interest.

This year will be intensive for NATO because the Madrid Summit will approve the "New Strategic
Concept", the implementation of which will have an impact on how we will defend ourselves, develop,
prevent crises, and adapt to the new innovative technology developments, as well as in the
international cooperation.
Priority should be given to supporting and fulfilling all the obligations in order to develop the
national capacities, engagements in the international activities, missions, and operations,
increasing the interoperability and cooperation with the member and partner countries of
NATO, EU, and the region.

Special attention should be given to the obligations and commitments coming from the status of
the Republic of Albania, as a member of the United Nations Security Council.
The Balkan region should remain a priority in bilateral and multilateral engagements, and
particularly continuing to provide comprehensive and unrestricted support to the Ministry of
Defense of the Republic of Kosovo and the consolidation of its Security Force.

**7.2 Regional Cooperation:** Active contribution should proceed to be active in the regional
initiatives and its aim should be to promote cooperation, while consolidating security, stability, and

i S h E


-----

Pursuant to this cooperation, the purpose of these regional initiatives, such as maintaining peace and
stability, Euro-Atlantic integration and promoting regional cooperation, which are also the priorities
of the foreign policy of the Republic of Albania should be taken into consideration.
Regional military cooperation should aim at promoting not only the establishment and use of joint
military capabilities, civil emergency response capacities, but also the establishment and use of joint
capabilities in international operations.
**7.3 International contribution:** The main goal is to maintain an active role beyond the national
context and also in operations to restore international stability, because the defense of Albania
begins outside our territorial borders, so prevention is the most effective approach.
Albania’s representation in Alliance structures, and in international missions and operations, should
be re-evaluated in order to increase its contributions. In this regard, we aim to increase our
contribution based on the interoperability and characteristics of the Albanian Armed Forces, taking
into account the added value of different missions by paying special attention to regional
environment.
As far as Security Cooperation is concerned, we should support the Alliance initiatives in order to
strengthen partnerships, and contribute to arms control and disarmament.

**8. Strategic communication.**
The internal and external communication efforts should be harmonized, as an important factor for
the development of a common identity and a desired image for the Defense. Communication of all
possible audiences of the mission and activity of the Defense should be achieved, in full compliance
with the implementation and protection of strategic interests. Efforts for misinformation and
narratives, which are contrary to the strategic interests of our country, should be reduced,
underlining the importance and positive effects of fulfilling these interests.

**CONCLUSIONS**
Pursuant to this directive, I request all the structures of the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces
to draft plans, programs and projects oriented by priorities and work directions, as well as to take all
necessary measures to accomplish them on time and with quality, applying lessons learned to
eliminate shortcomings in order to adapt and become successful in the implementation of the Defense
Directive 2022.
