PROJECTS, CONCEPTS, PLANS

**Defense concept of the Republic of Latvia**

Approved by the decision of the National Security Council of 22 May 1995.

Basically accepted at the sitting of the Cabinet of Ministers on June 13, 1995,

instructing the Ministry of Defense to prepare

draft legal acts necessary for the implementation of the concept

**Introduction**

**The need for Latvia's military defense**

It seems hopeless for a small country with limited military potential to resist a much stronger aggressor militarily.

However, the Latvian people are not able to survive foreign occupation. If the Latvian people do not defend themselves

against aggression by all possible means, Latvia will be occupied and Latvians will soon cease to exist as a nation. State

defense by military means may require great human sacrifices, but Latvia has no other choice if it wants to exist as an

independent state.

Perspective material purchase plan of the Ministry of Defense.

**Financial constraints and assumptions**

Given the burden on the state budget, significant defense spending is currently not considered eligible. It is therefore

necessary to find a compromise between the military-political situation that determines the country's threats and the

country's capabilities. The current budget allocation is limited and hinders the development of the NAF. In order to

ensure the necessary development of the NAF, it must be assumed that:

-  the necessary budgetary resources will be found, possibly by combining a more targeted use of existing resources

with a real increase in national defense resources. The speed of implementation of the force structure development

plan and their successive establishment depend on the budget resources allocated for national defense.

-  Latvia's defense budget as a percentage of the country's gross domestic product will not exceed the defense budgets

of Western European countries.

**Public restrictions**

Currently, there is a lack of public and political support for the significant development of the NAF, as a significant

part of the population is still reminiscent of the service in the Latvian NAF in the USSR Armed Forces and the military

occupation of Latvia. There is also no consensus on what Latvia's security situation should be, although national

defense is considered important. All this is reflected in the attitude of young people towards compulsory public service

and voluntary military service. To the Ministry of Defense:

-  step up the debate on defense issues in the media;

-  explain why armed resistance to aggression is needed;

-  demonstrate that armed resistance is possible and necessary;

-  to ensure that the public change their views on the Latvian NAF and the service in them.

**The aim**

The purpose of this document is to establish an effective defense system and to determine the Latvian defense policy

and the corresponding structures of the National Armed Forces in order to create a basis for the development, financial

and operational plans of the National Armed Forces.

Restriction.

Only the potential internal and external military threats against the state system, ie the organized use of armed force

for political purposes, are taken into account in drafting the document.

**Security in the Baltic region**

Latvia's security is inseparable from Baltic security in general. This is emphasized by the work of the Baltic Council of

Ministers in coordinating the solution of security and defense problems in the Baltic States. The threat to one Baltic


-----

concerted action by the Baltic States. However, it is in the interests of all three Baltic States to act in concert.

Coordinated military action should facilitate this cooperation. From a purely military point of view, only together will

the Baltic States be able to resist aggression.

To the Ministries of (National) Defense of the Baltic States:

-  develop common National Security and Defense Concepts;

-  ensure close cooperation between the headquarters of the armed forces;

-  develop weapons and communication systems capable of working together;

-  ensure coordinated action on borders, territories, maritime economic zones

and airspace control;

-  provide similar military training;

-  create joint units, such as BALTBAT.

**Analysis of military tasks**

Latvia's security situation is determined by a set that includes military force, the Western economic presence and

international obligations, in which Latvia's membership in the family of European nations must be emphasized. The

military elements of this situation can be divided into two groups of tasks: those tasks related to peacetime and those

that the NAF must perform in a state of war. As a basic principle, it should be emphasized that under no circumstances

should Latvia's political and military action create the impression of obedience.

**Protection of the state and population in peacetime**

The NAF peacetime tasks (M) are:

M1:

Participate in the creation of a deterrence factor, showing the NAF's determination and ability to protect the entire

territory of Latvia:

-  maintain a small and well-trained resilient rapid reaction force

an unexpected attack or armed border crossing;

-  provide relevant training;

-  perform intelligence tasks;

-  confirm readiness to mobilize;

-  prepare for additional forces by cooperating to support its friendly countries

and / or organizations to send additional forces;

-  to protect and secure military installations.


-----

-  to ensure the inviolability of the land territory of Latvia;

-  to ensure the inviolability of the Latvian sea area and airspace;

-  carry out surveillance in cooperation with civilian authorities and friendly countries;

-  to establish the intentional borders, territories, sea waters and airspace of Latvia

harassment and respond to it.

M3:

To support the civilian authorities in overcoming the crisis in accordance with the procedures prescribed by law:

-  to prevent the violent overthrow of the legitimate government and the provisions of the Satversme

change of state equipment;

-  be ready to use the NAF as a crisis management tool;

-  to acquire skills in limiting incidents;

-  help prevent the situation from deteriorating;

-  respond to requests for assistance in the fight against terrorism.

M4:

To support Latvia's wider security interests by participating in international activities:

-  Participate in UN peacekeeping and humanitarian operations

or within the OSCE;

-  to support international security together with the other Baltic States

with the help of BALTBAT;

-  maximum participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace program.

M5:

elimination of the consequences of technological accidents;

-  carry out search and rescue operations using naval and air force units;

-  to perform transport tasks of the NAF and the government;

-  carry out environmental monitoring and protection together with civil authorities;

-  provide staff with honors and other ceremonies.


-----

The tasks of the NAF during the war (K) are:

Q1:

Immediately determine the fact of armed aggression:

-  guard the whole border;

-  to resist any cross-border attack on the Republic of Latvia by armed force.

K2:

Protect critical objects:

-  those few objects that are of crucial political or practical importance to Latvia

reasons, must be vigorously protected for as long as possible.

Q3:

Immediately repay the enemy for aggression:

-  Defend or destroy objects suitable for invasion, such as aerodromes

and landing areas;

-  block, repel and prevent the movement of the enemy;

-  Fight where the attacker can inflict the most damage with the least

harm to themselves;

-  Avoid decisive battles.

Q4:

If the attack cannot be repelled, take long, convincing resistance:

-  divide into small groups and continue local resistance with the actions of small units;

-  small units must be able to fight independently using the aggressor's weaknesses,

even if the command structure is not functioning;

-  to prevent the intruder's freedom of action in the occupied territory;

-  to attract as many enemy forces as possible;

-  continuously cause damage to the aggressor;

-  ensure lasting organized and armed resistance.

Q5:

Providing a legitimate government:


-----

-  to ensure the legitimate government's communication with the world's leading citizens

individuals and the international press;

-  protect the legitimate government.

**Necessary military structures**

**In general**

Whenever possible, units should perform as many tasks. This is most clearly the case for units with different peacetime

and wartime missions. The list mentions the components of the NAF that are necessary for the performance of the

previously defined tasks. Their main responsibilities are indicated:

One Mobile Rifle Brigade (MSBr). (M1, M3, M4, M5, K2, K3.)

National Guard. (M1, M3, M5, K2, K3, K4.)

Naval Forces. (Separate concept.) (M2, M5, K1.)

Air force. (Separate concept.) (M2, M3, M4, M5, K1, K5.)

Special Task Force (SUV). (M3, M5, K4, K5.)

BALTBAT group [ornament; battalion headquarters and support elements]. (M4.)

NAF Headquarters and Staff Battalion. (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, K1, K5.)

[Border Guard Brigade (Rbr). (M1, M2, K1, K4)]

NAF team composition

The total number and structure of the NAF indicate that no more than one Commander-in-Chief, Commander-in-Chief

(NATO 2 *), would be required. It is necessary to have several candidates for the position of Commander.

Staff tasks

The NAF headquarters performs most of the management functions. Subordinate headquarters, especially Naval and

Air Force headquarters, should be as small as possible and deal exclusively with matters of their specialty. There must

be no duplication in the core functions of the headquarters. The supply of NAF components must be unified. A

headquarters battalion is needed to support the activities of the NAF headquarters. At present, it also performs the

duties of a guard of honor.

MSBr

Tasks M3, K2 and K3 require light rifle battalions the most. The rapid reaction requirements state that one battalion

must always be well trained and fully operational. The only way to guarantee such quality and readiness is to assemble

one battalion and its support elements from full-time, professional soldiers. The MSBr must include the following

elements:

A headquarters capable of operational operation.


-----

Two compulsory service rifle battalions.

Battle support and combat support unit.

It is necessary to maintain the skills and knowledge of specialists in specific military functions. This should be done by

the Combat Support and Combat Supply Support Unit, which should also participate in specialist training.

**Staff**

Staffing policy

The NAF consists of three main elements: professional volunteers (conscripts), conscripts and volunteers (non
conscripts). There is also a civilian support element. After completing full-time or compulsory service, soldiers become

mobilizable reservists. The principle of interchangeability between the various elements must be observed. For

example, regular National Guard and MSBr soldiers must be able to replace each other, taking into account suitability

and qualifications. The NAF must introduce uniformity - the concept of a unified army.

Full-time forces and compulsory service

Although some tasks of the NAF require well-trained, professional soldiers, who are always at a high level of readiness,

many other tasks require compulsory service units, which play an equally important role in the defense of Latvia.

Soldiers who have completed compulsory service join the National Guard or assume the responsibility of a reservist.

However, the following elements must be for ordinary professionals:

For one group of the Rifle Battalion.

SUV.

BALTBAT group.

For the management of the National Guard (about 10%).

For officers, some instructors and specialists in other units (about 50%).

National Guard

The composition of the outer line of the National Guard must be as large as the state can afford and supported by the

population by volunteering.

Reserves and mobilization

Soldiers who have completed full-time or compulsory service shall be mobilized as reservists in the local National

Guard Battalion. Soldiers trained by the NAF are mainly prepared for mobilization in order to develop Latvia's military

practice and ethics and not rely on the methods of the former Soviet army. This means that at the beginning there will

be few reservists, but their number will increase together with the NAF's ability to arm and supply reservists.

**Equipment**

Weapons must meet the needs of the NAF tactical doctrine: mainly "hit and run" tactics. The acquisition policy for the

next five years will be to continue to use Soviet era weapons and fill gaps but to do its utmost to bring NATO into line


-----

Small arms and battalion level support weapons

Initially, Soviet-era small arms are used because they are cheaper, more accessible and ammunition cheaper. In

particular, the following must be provided:

Chsa distance light anti-tank weapons.

Medium range guided anti-tank weapons.

Low level anti-aircraft weapons: machine guns and missiles.

Light and medium mortars.

Ammunition.

Heavy weapons

Heavy weapons units (such as tanks and artillery) are too complicated for training, expensive to care for, and

unjustifiably vulnerable to a militarily developed, air-dominated opponent. An exception could be 100 mm cannons

donated by the Czech Republic, which could be used as anti-tank or coastguard weapons.

Contact

Every effort should be made to ensure that all NAF communication systems are able to co-operate with the other Baltic

States and with NATO. Equally important is the national communication plan for overcoming the crisis and ensuring

that the legitimate government communicates in the event of aggression.

Mobility and armor

Initially, MSBr mobility can be ensured by supplying one full battalion with unarmed wheeled vehicles. In the future, it

would be ideal to provide the entire brigade with armed wheeled transport - if finances allow it. The following

sequence is observed:

Provide one battalion with unarmed transport.

Create two more battalions.

Provide all battalions with unarmed vehicles.

To provide a professional battalion with armed wheeled vehicles.

Provide the entire crew with armed wheeled transport.

Mobility in the air

In order to be able to move quickly to any part of Latvia, SUV and MSBr need air mobility. At the beginning, it is

enough to be able to move one wire in full combat readiness to any point in Latvia in a short time.

**States**

New staff should be prepared on the basis of actual rather than intended composition. Uniformity must be introduced

**Information security**

There seems to be a contradiction between the security requirements of intelligence and the openness needed to

convince a potential aggressor of a willingness to resist. This contradiction can be resolved by using the directive team

style without unnecessary detail and by using flexibility in military planning.

**Summary and conclusions**

Acceptance of this concept means that the following is accepted:

-  The necessary resources to implement the necessary changes will not be allocated immediately. The force

development plan together with the budget allocation will determine the implementation process.

-  Military co-operation between the Baltic States will gradually become closer. BALTBAT will require continued

support.

-  The tasks of the NAF peace and war are recognized.

-  The concept of a united army is recognized. The NAF consists of:

A small professional element.

Limited compulsory service.

Strong National Guards.

For light, mobile forces without heavy weapons, armed with Soviet-era small arms, but using a communications

system that ensures cooperation with NATO.

-  Next required works:

Force development plan.

Operational protection plan.

Five - year budget expenditure plan.
