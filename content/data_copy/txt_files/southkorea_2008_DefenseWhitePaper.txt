Message from
the Minister of National Defense

The year 2008 was a remarkable year for Korea, during which it took an energetic step
towards building a “Country that Stands Tall in the World through Advancement.”

This year also marked the historic 60th anniversary of the Republic of Korea (ROK)
Armed Forces. The Korean military has successfully overcome many challenges and
hardships over the past sixty years, including the Korean War. As a protector of the
constitutional values of liberal democracy and market economy, the ROK Armed Forces
have been the steadfast guardians of peace on the Korean Peninsula. Further, they have
shared the proud history of the nation’s prosperity with its people every step of the way.
Going forward, the ROK Armed Forces will take advantage of past experiences and
accomplishments to reshape themselves, ushering in another successful sixty years of
history.
Today’s rapidly changing security environment presents new challenges and
opportunities for the Korean military.
Around the globe, we are witnessing the emergence of new dynamics of international
competition and cooperation based on the disparate interests of nations. At the same
time, traditional military threats persist even as we see an increase in transnational and
non-military threats. In Northeast Asia, an arms race continues as regional powers vie for
their regional leadership amidst the ever-growing cooperation and interdependence.
On the Korean Peninsula, the government of the Republic of Korea has continued its
efforts to steer its relationship with North Korea towards mutual benefits and common
prosperity. Despite these efforts, North Korea’s military threats remain unchanged, and
South-North relations have continually strained.
Domestically, the ROK is facing a tough economic situation in the wake of the global
financial crisis. Our military is expected to efficiently manage Korea’s defense and
flawlessly implement defense policy tasks such as defense reform and transfer of wartime
operational control.


-----

The difficulties in domestic and global security environment and defense situation pose
unique defense challenges for our military and require more fortitude and focus than ever
before.
To better support Korea’s national vision and fulfill its role in this era, the Ministry of
National Defense has formulated a new vision for the coming years: an “Elite and
Advanced Military.”We have drawn the Eight Tenets of Defense Policy from this vision
and have consistently pushed forward these tenets.
Throughout 2008, the Ministry of National Defense has introduced bold measures to
break away from the existing practices and implemented incessantly various reforms and
transformations across the whole spectrum of national defense. The foremost goal of this
reform effort was to promote a culture of “strong warriors”and “strong military”
dedicated to combat, in order to build the foundation required to develop our armed
forces into an advanced and strong military. Internationally, the ROK Armed Forces have
successfully carried out various peacekeeping activities, contributing to world peace and
enhancing Korea’s stature on the international stage.
We will continue to build an all-directional military readiness and defense capabilities
that enable us to protect our nation against not only North Korea’s military threats but
against all threats across the spectrum. The ROK-U.S. Alliance will evolve into a futureoriented strategic alliance. No less important, we will strive to reduce the burden of
defense expenditures through low-cost, high-efficiency defense management.
Furthermore, the Korean military will transform itself into an institution that further
respects the comforts and needs of the citizens it protects.

Defense White Paper 2008 is the first such paper to be published under the Lee Myungbak administration. It reflects our will and efforts in all aspects relevant to defense,
including defense policy guidelines and key achievements, as we strive to realize the new
administration’s national security strategy. In particular, we tried to provide detailed


-----

information on topics of keen interest to both Korean and international readers, including

the ROK’s defense posture, defense reform, and the future direction of the ROK-U.S.
Alliance among others. In addition, the Appendix includes various defense data that may
be useful for academic research in the fields of national security and defense.
It is my hope that Defense White Paper 2008 will foster a better understanding of our
efforts toward developing an advanced force capable of meeting the strategic challenges
of the 21st century and strengthen the public’s trust and care for the military. The
continued interest and support of the Korean public will help us in our endeavor as we
move forward.

Chapter 1 Changes and Challenges in Security Environment

Section1. Global Security Environment


Coupled with conventional military threats, the global security today is characterized by

increasing transnational and non-military threats, such as terrorism, proliferation of

weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and natural disasters. Elements causing security

threats including disputes over territorial, resource, religious, and racial issues are

becoming multifarious and complicated.

In such an environment, all countries endeavor to maximize their own interests,

strengthen their security capabilities, and at the same time exercise strategic cooperation

and restraint in foreign affairs.

1. The Changing Security Threat


The most notable changes in the security
environment today is the rise of complicated and multifarious transnational and
non-military threats besides conventional
military threats. Threats such as terrorism,
proliferation of WMDs, cyber attack, etc.

Chinese troops ordered onto the sceneof the Sichuan Province earthquake have become universal, encompassing
disaster (May 2008) wide areas. Other non-military threats such

as contagious diseases, natural disasters,
global warming, and environmental pollution have also come to the fore as
major pending issues.

Section 1 Global Security Environment


The proliferation of WMDs such as nuclear, biological, and chemical
weapons, as well as the means to deliver them through ballistic missiles is
seen as one of the primary factors posing a major threat to global security
today. It is particularly damaging to global security that some nations possess
the technology to develop nuclear weapons and long-range missiles. In
addition, they can easily acquire related parts and materials on the
international black markets. Furthermore, biochemical weapons such as
anthrax and sarin gas feared to be easily manufactured at low cost, which
allows non-state actors[1)] to secure such weapons without a great deal of
difficulty.
Since the September 11 attacks in 2001, the activities of non-state actors
have been regarded as one of the primary factors threatening global security.
They are now able to acquire means of attack and yield destructive power
that was not possible in the past, due to the globalization process and
advancement of information technology. Moreover, it is usually the case that
unlike a regular army, they are organized as diffuse networks of
multinational members, rendering efficient management difficult.
Meanwhile, though the likelihood of a large scale war has diminished
since the end of the Cold War, various types of local warfare continue all
over the world. These result from the effect of complex factors such as
territorial and resource disputes, religious and racial conflicts, and separatist
and independence movements. In the Middle East, the Iraq War that began
in 2003 is still ongoing. As for the war between Israel and Lebanon that
began in July 2006, although it came to an end, the causes of the war are still
remaining. In Europe, Kosovo
declared independence from Serbia
in February 2008. Immediate approvals were echoed by the United States
and the major EU countries, but
several countries including Russia,
China, and India have yet to do so. A speech by Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim

Thaqi for the declaration of independence

The recent competition between
nations to secure energy resources
has become a new variable in the Chad
global system, elevating the impor- Sudan
tance of energy security. Consequently, major powers vie with each
other for new energy sources in Central Asia, South America, Africa, and the Caspian Sea as well as in the Middle

East, thereby destabilizing the situation in the areas. In particular, some
states[2)] continue to strengthen their stature and influence within the
international community by flexing their energy resource power.
There are also new, previously unforeseen security threats that have come
to the forefront of the international community. Such incidents as the spread
of contagious diseases (Avian flu and SARS), and large scale natural disasters
(Sichuan Province earthquake in China, cyclone in Myanmar, etc.) can have
both an unpredictable and unprecedented effect on global security.

2. International Efforts for Peace and Stability


2) Since Venezuela declared
a nationalization of resources
in 2007, countries such as
Bolivia, Ecuador, Uruguay,
Chile, and Argentina have
joined the movement to nationalize raw materials (2008
Diplomatic White Paper).

12


As potential global security threats have become increasingly diverse and
complex, new countermeasures have been required accordingly.
Since a countermeasure employed by one single country against
transnational and non-military threats has its limitations, cooperation with
allies and friendly countries and the international community should be
emphasized. Indeed, comprehensive countermeasures are most necessary,
ranging from the existing military means to non-military ones including
diplomacy, judicial review, information, and economy. Thus, when it
became clear that al Qaeda was behind the 9/11 attacks, the notion that


-----

Section 1 Global Security Environment


mutual assistance on a global basis was
essential to deal with the problem of preventing
proliferation of terror and weapons of mass
destruction was given great credence.
Accordingly, the international community has
reinforced international cooperation to prevent
the proliferation of WMDs and to counter
terrorism. As part of such international cooperation, various regimes have been further strength
Training for the prevention of ened to deal with information sharing, freezing

of assets, criminal investigative cooperation,

Training for the prevention of
proliferation of WMDs

search and extradition of terrorists, etc. International activities to prevent the
proliferation of WMDs are promoted through international conventions and
an international organization. International conventions include the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC),
the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), the Hague Code of Conduct
against Ballistic Missile Proliferation (HCOC) and as an international
organization it includes the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). In
addition, the United States expands the activities preventing the proliferation
of WMDs that could be linked to international terrorism by utilizing the
Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI),[3)] in which 93 countries are participating
directly or indirectly as of October 2008.
The 9/11 attacks that took place in 2001 have become an event that made
people realize the sheer scale of the present threat to international security.
Thereafter, nations around the world including the United States began the
“Global War on Terrorism.”Along with the Afghan troops, the International
Security Assistance Forces (ISAF),[4)] which is comprised of multi-national
forces, currently continues operations to eradicate the remnants of al Qaeda
and the Taliban in Afghanistan.
The international community continues to make an effort to solve various
types of local disputes. At the Middle East Peace Conference held in
Annapolis, U.S., in November 2007, it was agreed that a peace agreement for

with 11 European and Asian
countries.

4) International Security
Assistance Force (ISAF)
In line with the resolution by
the United Nations Security
Council, multi-national forces
of 53,000 troops are comprised from about 40 countries as of June 2008 in
order to support the maintenance of public order and
reconstruction after the war
in Afghanistan.

the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would be concluded by the
end of 2008 with quadrilateral talks led by the U.S., EU, UN and Russia. In
addition, as of June 2008 about 12,000 UN peacekeeping forces from 26
countries are striving for peace and stability in Lebanon. The African Union
(AU) and UN play a role as mediator for peace and stability in the Darfur
region of Sudan in which a five-year long civil war rages on. However,
despite the mediation efforts by the international community, social conflict
and the bloodshed due to civil war abide.

Section 2 Security Situation in Northeast Asia

Section2. Security Situation in Northeast Asia


In Northeast Asia, cooperation and interdependence among nations are deepening in

various fields such as security, economy, etc. In the meantime, factors for potential

conflict such as North Korea’s nuclear issue, the cross-strait relations, historical disputes,

and territorial disputes over islands still persist. Simultaneously, each Northeast Asian

nation continues to make an effort to enhance its influence and modernize its military

forces.

1. The Regional Security Structure


Northeast Asia is an area concentrated with major economic and military
powers in which traditional confrontation and cooperation coexist. Within
this security structure, the major powers in the area maintain mutual
cooperation and balance of power at the same time.
While the United States, which is in a security alliance with both Japan and
Australia, is solidifying the alliances with both nations, the three nations are
strengthening tripartite security cooperation since the Japan-Australia Joint
Declaration on Security Cooperation in March 2007.[5)] Also, in October of the
same year, a triangular security cooperative system of the United States,
Japan and Australia was set into motion by a combined maritime training
exercise.
China and Russia too are strengthening a strategic cooperative relationship.
The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO),[6)] formed around China and
Russia, held a combined training exercise among member nations under

Japan has made its first
declaration for security
cooperation with a country
other than the United States.

6) The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO)
Its member states include
six nations of China, Russia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
Tadzhikistan, and Uzbekistan. It is an organization
established on June 15,
2001 for the purpose of
mutual cooperation and
security enhancement in the
region among the governments with a summit meeting held annually.

China’s initiative for the first time in 2005, and for the second time in July
2008 under the leadership of Russia. The SCO held a defense minister’s
meeting of member countries in May 2008 and agreed to hold the third
combined training exercise in 2010.
Meanwhile, neighboring countries run parallel ventures in an effort to
resolve any security uncertainties. The Secretary of Defense of the United
States visited China in November 2007 and agreed to set up a military hot
line between the two countries, which went operational in April 2008. As for
China, Minister of National Defense visited Japan in September 2007, and in
November of the same year a Chinese naval vessel made a port call to
Japan. On the other hand, a Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force ship visited a
port in China in June 2008 for the first time since World War II.


2. Security Issues in the Region

Northeast Asia, unlike the rest of the world, is an area that contains many
varied and challenging issues such as North Korea’s nuclear issue, the crossstrait relations, the territorial disputes over islands, historical disputes,
exclusive economic zone (EEZ) issues, and so forth.
North Korea’s nuclear issue forms a serious threat to global security as well
as to the security of Northeast Asia. Since a nuclear test was conducted by
North Korea in October 2006, tension has built up in the region. As the sixparty talks continue to facilitate North Korea’s nuclear disarmament, there
were two rounds of agreements concluded among the participants via talks
in 2007. These included the “initial actions for the implementation of the
September 19 joint statement”(February 13 agreement accorded in February
2007) and the “second-phase actions for the implementation of the
September 19 joint statement”(October 3 agreement accorded in October
2007). In July 2008, an agreement was made for setting up a monitoring and
verification system at the meeting of chief delegates of the talks in July 2008,
and at the follow-up meeting of the respective foreign ministers they


16


-----

Section 2 Security Situation in Northeast Asia


reconfirmed a political mandate for North Korea’s denuclearization. The
participating nations of the talks are making an effort to resolve the issue
based upon agreed principles.
The cross-strait relations[7)] is one of the potential threats to the security of
Northeast Asia. With the rise of the Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九) regime, whose
core political line was referred to as improving cross-strait relations at the
Taiwanese presidential election held in March 2008, a turning point occurred
appearing to ease the tension between the two. Also, as was evidenced by
the visit to China by Wu Bo-hsiung (吳伯雄), the Chairman of the
Kuomintang (the Nationalist Party) in May 2008, various efforts by China and
Taiwan to relax the tension continue. Nevertheless, the possibility of a
dispute in the cross-strait relations remains.
The existence of disputes over territorial sovereignty between China and
Japan, or between Japan and Russia is the cause of yet more unrest in the
region. There are also historic issues: China’s so-called Northeastern Project;
the distortion of the history textbook by Japan; and Japanese politicians’visits
to the Yasukuni Shrine are all factors contributing to the regional instability.
Besides these, the establishment of an EEZ to utilize oceanic resources has
become a potential factor for disputes as nations in the region adhere to the
position that is advantageous to their own country.

In Northeast Asia, a multinational security cooperation system like that of
Europe or other regions has not yet been established. Military powers such
as the United States, Japan, China, and Russia are competing for influence.
These military powers are pushing forward with the modernization of forces
in order to keep apace with the new security environment. Up-to-date
military posture of the four major powers surrounding the Korean Peninsula
is depicted in Figure 1-2.

A. The United States
As a consequence of the lessons learned from the 9/11 attacks, the
Afghanistan and Iraq wars, the United States is building up capabilities to
respond to a diverse array of new threats as well as traditional threats.[8)]

Consequently, the U.S. Army has been reorganizing its combat units and
support forces into light and maneuverable units. The U.S. Army
redeployment plan confirmed in December 2007 makes it essential for a total
of 48 brigades to be reorganized with 74,000 troops, including 65,000 active
duty and reserve troops, reinforced by 2011. The Navy and Air Force have
been promoting restructuring with the
emphasis on enhancing efficiency.
Considering the strategic importance of
the Asia Pacific area, the United States has
increased its Navy and Air Force assets in
the area. The Navy replaced the conventional aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk with Aircraft carrier George Washington

the nuclear powered aircraft carrier USS George Washington in August 2008.
The Navy also plans to deploy 60 percent of its submarine forces to the
Pacific by 2010. The Air Force plans a rotational deployment of one
squadron of its most advanced fighter, the F-22 Raptor, in Guam for the first
time.
The United States Forces Japan (USFJ)
has relocated the U.S. Army I Corps
(forward) based in the State of Washington
to Camp Zama in Japan in December 2007
and is being reorganized to be a command
which can execute an integrated mission

of the U.S. Forces in Japan. The 8,000
Marine Corps troops stationed in Okinawa are scheduled to be relocated to
Guam by 2014.
The U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) plans to maintain troop strength at 28,500
as agreed upon at the ROK-U.S. Summit in April 2008. At the same time
there are preparations underway for the transfer of its wartime operational
control to the ROK military in 2012. It is pushing ahead with restructuring in
order to enhance the war-fighting capabilities of the units under its
command.


B. Japan
Japan raised the Defense Agency to the status of a cabinet-level Ministry of
Defense (MOD) in January 2007. Furthermore, with the emphasis placed on
responding to the changing situation positively and on expanding the
regional role of the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF), it plans to draft the
new National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG) by the end of 2009.
While JSDF maintains about 240,000 military personnel, it has retired the
outmoded weapon systems and replaced them with high-tech weapon
systems. Major weapon systems that went operational most recently include
two new Atago-class destroyers, which are additional to the four existing
Kongo-class destroyers, and six Apache attack helicopters. In addition,


19

included in the ongoing modernization for armaments are newly developing
tanks, a 13,500 ton Hyuga-class helicopter-carrying destroyer (DDH), and air
refueling cargo aircraft.[9)]

Air refueling cargo aircraft Helicopter-carrying destroyer (DDH)


In addition, to strengthen its joint operational capability, Japan has
expanded the frequency of joint training sessions and built a unified C4I2,[10)]

thereby constructing an information integration-delivery-sharing system and
boosting interoperability.
In the field of military satellites, Japan has built a four-satellite structure by
successfully launching its fourth reconnaissance satellite in February 2007.
Subsequently, Japan’s Diet has made an institutional foothold for the
subsequent development and operation of a high performance
reconnaissance satellite and early warning satellite by passing the Space
Basic Act in May 2008 that allows military use of outer space.
On the other hand, as North Korea testlaunched a ballistic missile and conducted
a nuclear test in 2006, Japan has begun the
early construction of the Missile Defense
(MD) system. To this effect, Japan has
deployed ground-based interceptor missiles (PAC-3)[11)] at four bases of the Japan
Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) in the vicinity of Tokyo since March 2007. In December of the same year, Japan conducted
a ballistic missile interception test for sea- SM-3 interception test
based interceptor missiles (SM-3)[12)] off the

JASDF imported from the
U.S. Boeing co. in February
2008, which was remodeled
from a civilian cargo plane
into a multi-purpose airborne
tanker. It can airlift troops
and cargo in addition to air
refueling.

10) C4I2
This is a command and
control system for the JSDF,
and in consideration of the
weighted importance of
integrated operation by
JSDF following the creation
of the Joint Staff Office in
March 2006, interoperability
was added to the existing
C4I ( Command, Control,
Communication, Computer
& Intelligence) thereby changing its designation to C4I2.

coast of Hawaii in a joint effort with the U.S. In January 2008, Japan
operationally deployed a SM-3 loaded Aegis destroyer and further planned to
build a ground and seaborne MD system by 2010 in a joint effort with the
U.S.


C. China
China pushes ahead with military modernization through continuous
increases in the national defense budget[13) ]based on high economic growth.
This is an effort to attain the military strategy,[14)]“winning local wars in
conditions of informationization.”In particular, the army concentrates on an
enhancement of a rapid-reaction capability, the navy a deep-sea operations
capability, and the air force a long-range operation capability.
While the Army expands the aviation corps with attack helicopter units as
its main element, it is known to have created mobile tactical missile units for
deployment in the southeast region.
The Navy has introduced four Sovremenny-class destroyers (7,900 ton) and
12 Kilo-class submarines (2,300 ton) from Russia, thereby enhancing coastal
defense capability. The Navy deployed for active service in July 2008 a Jinclass strategic ballistic missile submarine (nuclear-powered) (SSBN) with
Julang (巨浪)-Ⅱtype ballistic missiles on board whose range reaches 8,000
km, and have another for test-runs. In the future, the Navy is scheduled to
have 5 Jin-class SSBNs including the two aforementioned vessels.

13) National Defense Expenditure of China
China announced at the
11th National People’s
Congress in March 2008
that their national defense
expenditure for 2008 would
be at $57.2 billion ( ¥417.8
billion ), which is a 17.6%
increase compared to that
of last year. This should
correspond to 7.2% of the
total budget for the year
2007, which is equivalent to
1.4% of the GDP. In the
meantime, U.S. Department
of Defense estimates the
real size of China’s national
defense expenditure to be
$97-139 billion ( threefold of
China’s proclaimed amount)
in the Annual Report on the
Military Power of the
People’s Republic of China,
released in March 2008.

14) Military Strategy of
China
China’s People’s Liberation
Army established informatization as a constructive
direction for national defense
modernization in order to
adapt to the international
strategic environment and
national security circumstances. It concentrates its
efforts on building the Navy,
the Air Force and the 2nd
Artillery, thereby focusing
mainly on winning local wars
in conditions of informationization.

The Air Force deployed its self-developed J-10 fighters operationally in
2007 and plans to produce additional J-10C bombers, the modified version of

the former. And while introducing the most advanced fighters including Su27/30 from Russia, the Air Force is concentrating its efforts on license
production via technology transfer and indigenous aircraft production. As of
June, 2008, it has four Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) aircraft
Kongjing (空警)-2000 and two small-sized KJ-200 aircraft, with a third KJ-200
aircraft under production. At present, the Air Force has 10 airborne tankers
and expands the radius of operations by making up for the weak points of
the air-to-air refueling device for the existing fighters.
In the meantime, China conducted a successful anti-satellite test with a
ballistic missile in January 2007 and launched a moon exploration satellite in
October of the same year, further preparing a construction plan for a space
station, thereby intensifying their efforts in space development.


D. Russia
Russia sees NATO’s expansion toward Eastern Europe[15)] and the American
drive for a MD system in Eastern Europe[16)] as important changes in the
security environment. As a response, Russia is enhancing its strategic
deterrence capabilities, as well as the efficiency of its command system by
reorganizing its force structure.

Topol-M missile MS Yuri Dolgorukiy


15) After the end of the Cold
War, 10 Eastern European
countries including Poland,
Czechoslovakia, and Hungary additionally joined
NATO, expanding the
number of member countries to a total of 26 countries as of June 2006, while
in early 2009 Albania and
Croatia are scheduled to
join.

16) The United States
agreed with the countries
concerned that a missile
tracking radar site would be
installed in Czechoslovakia
and an interception missile
base in Poland (July-August,
2007).


As for the ground forces, Russia has abandoned conventional strategic
missiles and initiated the deployment of inter-continental ballistic missiles
(ICBM: Topol-M) equipped with a new type of guidance device, thereby
completing deployment of 48 fixed missiles and 6 mobile missiles as of
December 2007. By 2015, it plans to enhance its nuclear deterrent by


22


-----

Section 2 Security Situation in Northeast Asia


deploying Topol-M missiles to a total of 9 regiments (6 fixed type regiments,
3 mobile type regiments).
As for the maritime forces, reinforcement to submarines is a prominent
agenda. In April of 2007, the first submarine of the Borei-class SSBN was
rolled out at the North Sea Fleet. Two more SSBNs by 2011 are scheduled to
be built for an assignment to the Pacific fleet. On the Borei-class SSBN,
Russia plans to mount 12 Bulava[17)] submarine launched ballistic missiles
(SLBM) for which Topol-M missiles were modified for a surface launch.
As for the aviation forces, Russia fortified long range operation capability
by improving the performance of the Tu-160/95/22 strategic bomber. It is
also preparing for future warfare by concurrently promoting the
development of the Sukhoi I-21(tentatively named)[18)] fifth-generation fighter.
In August 2007, Russia resumed long-range reconnaissance flights with
strategic bombers that had been suspended since the 1990s. Russia has lately
carried out vigorous reconnaissance
activities mainly over areas of strategic
interest such as the Arctic Ocean and the
North Pacific. Also, in air defense, it continues to field deploy new type air defense
missiles (S-400 Triumph) centering on the S-400 Triumph air defense missile
Metropolitan Area.
As for military structure, Russia plans to integrate the present system of six
military districts[19)] into three regional headquarters: the West, the South, and
the East. This is aimed at raising operational efficiency by simplifying the
command system. Presently, the usefulness of this restructuring is being
tested through command and staff training. In accordance with the integration plan for regional headquarters, each respective region is as shown in
Figure 1-3.

Section 3 North Korean Situation and Military Threat


Section3.

North Korean Situation and Military Threat


In 2008 the New Year’s joint editorial, North Korea announced it would grow into “a

strong and prosperous socialist nation”by the year 2012. To achieve this, the North

urged a general mobilization in order to construct “a nation driven by a strong ideology,

military, and economy.”North Korea also made it clear that it would concentrate its

efforts on maintaining the regime with the National Defense Committee (NDC) Chairman

Kim Jong Il at the center and as its leader through the “military-first politics.”

While North Korea is seeking to improve Pyongyang-Washington ties and promote

friendship with China and Russia externally, North Korea is concentrating on improving

its relationship with the Third World. In relation to South Korea, North Korea criticizes the

government’s policy towards the North and takes hard-line measures against the South,

thereby creating a tense political situation between the two countries.

In terms of military strength, North Korea maintains its huge conventional military

power as before, and continues to develop weapons of mass destruction (WMD). This

creates a threat to the Korean Peninsula and to the general security of the region.


1. Domestic and Foreign Policy

A. Domestic Policy
North Korea is intensifying its military capability under the banner of
“building a strong and prosperous socialist nation.”The North has
consolidated the “military-first politics”that has been advocated since the
establishment of the Kim Jong Il regime. It has since promoted the stability of
the regime and transposed the NDC into a permanent organization. By

visits a military unit (August 6, 2008)


replacing some senior officials in the party, government and military,
Pyongyang is continuing to stabilize the regime with the Chairman of the
NDC, Kim Jong Il at the helm.
Economically, by adhering to a socialist economic system and promoting
limited reform and opening policy, the North Korean economy is
experiencing a limitation on its recovery.
Recently, North Korea has been concentrating on resolving the “food
issue”with such rhetoric as “achieve one’s salvation through one’s own
effort”and “the people’s livelihood-first principle”in order to overcome the
food shortages brought on by the current economic crisis. Despite having
exerted all its efforts to counter the economic crisis with such measures as
the elevation of livelihood for residents through an increased output of
comestibles, daily necessities, electric power and coal, the truth of the matter
is that the North has not harvested substantial results.
Socially, North Korea has imposed
more strict controls on freedom of
thought in an effort to oust capitalist
ideology and adopted strong control
measures in the border areas against
North Koreans who attempt to
defect. Additionally, while increasing Barbed-wire fences along
the punishment for deviations such

Barbed-wire fences along
the North Korea-China border

as bribery, abuse of power, accumulation of wealth by illicit means and so forth, the North is conducting a form


26


-----

Section 3 North Korean Situation and Military Threat


of propaganda education on the population to reconsolidate internal control.
In terms of the military, foremost, North Korea is concentrating efforts on
strengthening asymmetric force. To this end, the North is focusing on
strengthening its special warfare capability through augmenting the light
infantry units and enhancing their night-time and mountaineering trainings.
In addition, the North is developing diversified missiles such as new surfaceto-surface and surface-to-ship missiles, and constructing submarines and
midget submarines. Second, North Korea is reinforcing the capability to
execute modern warfare. This is evidenced by the construction of a
command automation system and by the cultivation of computer hackers for
cyber warfare. Thirdly, the North is preparing ways to enhance the
survivability during wartime such as the deployment of electronic jamming
and deception devices and the construction of underground fighter bases.
Furthermore, North Korean military is conducting planned military training as
usual by securing the military supplies in spite of economic difficulties. In
doing so, it continues to create military tension including infiltration of the
Northern Limit Line (NLL)[20)] on the West Sea boundary while operating at
top level combat readiness.

B. Foreign Policy
The North is focusing on navigating through the difficulties presented to
them by the nuclear negotiations with the
United States since conducting a nuclear
test in October 2006. In 2007, North Korea
agreed to the February 13 and October 3
Accords that outlined the declaration and
disablement of its nuclear programs and
economic compensations by the nations
concerned through the six-party talks and
bilateral contacts between North Korea U.S. State Department’s director of

Korean affairs is taking over

and the U.S. Accordingly, the nuclear supplementary data for the declaration of

the North Korean nuclear programs

facilities at Yongbyon were frozen, closed, (Panmunjeom, May 10, 2008)


20) The Northern Limit Line

Force in the West and East
Seas.

Chapter 1 Changes and Challenges in Security Environment

and sealed in accordance with the disablement measure. In May of 2008,
North Korea submitted a document entailing its nuclear weapons activities to
the United States, and then submitted a formal statement to the People’s
Republic of China, the chair of the six-party talks. However, due to certain
verification issues regarding North Korea’s nuclear programs, the United
States deferred the removal of North Korea from the U.S. state-sponsors of
terrorism list. This has resulted in the North responding by stopping the
disablement process and restoring its nuclear facilities. In early October, a
tentative agreement over the verification scheme between the U.S. and the
North was made, and as the U.S. announced the removal of North Korea
from the terrorism list, the disablement process resumed later that month.
However, the North still shows a negative attitude in adopting a documented
verification protocol.
To Japan, North Korea urges the liquidation of past affairs and continues to
criticize the strengthening of its military capabilities. This includes the
construction of a missile defense system and the increase of reconnaissance
satellites. Additionally, although both sides established informal workinglevel contacts to resume talks for normalizing diplomatic relations, no
progress was made due to a sharp difference of opinion related to the reinvestigation of kidnapped Japanese citizens and the lift of economic sanctions.
In relation to China, Pyongyang is focusing on restoring the relationship
that has been apathetic since the nuclear test through mutual exchanges
between political parties, governments, and the militaries. As evidenced by
the conclusion of the Rajin (�津)-Khasan railway construction contract, the
North maintains freindly cooperative relationship with Russian based on
economic cooperation.
In regard to the Third World countries, North Korea maintains friendly
relations with a total of 160 countries including seven countries that had
established diplomatic relations or restored relations in 2007. Pyongyang is
focusing its diplomatic efforts to strengthen political, economic, and military
cooperation.

Section 3 North Korean Situation and Military Threat

C. Policy toward South Korea
While North Korea is active in gaining
economic profits through non-governmental economic cooperation, the North
avoids dialogue with the authorities of the
South. North Korea further disrupts the
public opinion of the South and continues

Office of Inter-Korean Economic

to alienate the relationship between Korea Cooperation in Gaeseong Ind.

Complex

and the United States, such as asserting
withdrawal of the U.S. forces from Korea. Moreover, while threatening the
peace on the Korean Peninsula and its region with the nuclear testing, North
Korea still maintains a passive attitude in building substantial military
confidence to reduce the tension and facilitating peace on the Peninsula.
Since the June 15 South-North Summit Talks, North Korea has been
continuing discussions with the South and actively participating in the SouthNorth exchanges and cooperation projects that are profit-oriented, such as
the construction of the Gaeseong Industrial Complex and Mt. Geumgang
tour program. However, Pyongyang has been degrading South Korea’s new
policy toward the North, and resuming reprobation activity against the South,
which had been in abeyance. This attitude is causing some new frictions to
arise.
In addition, North Korea unilaterally deported South Koreans in charge of
the Office of Inter-Korean Economic Cooperation in Gaesong, and further
cut off the hot line of Panmunjeom. Since December 1, 2008, the North has
been taking steadfast measures by limiting or blockading ground passage on
the Military Demarcation Line.

Chapter 1 Changes and Challenges in Security Environment

2. Military Policy, Strategy and Organizations


A. Military Policy and Strategy
North Korea adheres to the strategy of “the communization of the entire
Korean Peninsula”as manifested in the North Korean Worker’s Party (KWP)
Regulations. To make this a reality, the North maintains large scale military
power. The North Korean military policy is rooted in the Four-Point Military
Guidelines[21)] adopted in 1962. Despite deepening economic difficulties, the
North preferentially assigns national resources to the military sector under the
banner of “military-first politics,”thereby continuously reinforcing its military
forces.
North Korea’s military strategy toward the South is the “short-term
blitzkrieg strategy”to win the war before the arrival of the U.S. augmentation
forces. This strategy can be deduced from the consideration of the battlefield
environment on the Korean Peninsula. To this end, the military will try to
take the initiative in the war through “an early surprise attack”and mixed
warfare with the regular and guerrilla army. At the same time, the military
will exploit a success with its firepower and armored, mechanized units.
Having learnt from the wars of Afghanistan and Iraq, the military has recently
been enhancing the capability of Special Warfare; strengthening training for
operations in urban areas, the mountains and at night; and reinforcing the
capability of modern warfare execution.
North Korea has been allocating a large part of its national budget on
defense. From the late 1960s to the early 1970s, Pyongyang detailed the
military spending for those fiscal years, 30 percent of the total national
budget. Since 1972, Pyongyang has announced the only ordinary
expenditures as the national defense budget while undisclosing most of its
defense budget.[22)] It is estimated that North Korea’s actual military
expenditures exceed 30 percent of its gross national income (GNI). This is
the estimated amount considering the characteristics of its regime and budget
system. It is known that there is another source of income through the
independent military accounts: the defense industry, the exports of arms,

Assembly in April 2008. (The
actual defense expenditure
is uncertain.)

and businesses set up within the military to bring in foreign currency.


B. Military Command Organizations
The National Defense Committee (NDC) is the highest-ranking military
command organization in North Korea. It is clearly expressed in the North
Korean constitution that the NDC decides on national defense-related issues
and defense projects.
The General Political Bureau (GPB) manages the KWP’s apparatus within
the military and relevant political indoctrination programs. The General Staff
Department (GSD) has the command authority for all military operations.
The Ministry of People’s Armed Forces (MPAF) represents the military
externally. The MPAF also exercises the military administration authority by
managing and implementing the military affairs such as military diplomacy,
logistics, military finance, etc.
Since the inauguration of the Kim Jong Il regime, the relationship among
the GPB, the GSD and the MPAF has changed horizontally. As for the MPAF,
its stature and functions have weakened, but it still represents North Korea
military. The military command organizations of North Korea under the NDC
are shown in Figure 1-4.

Missile Guidance Bureau, and Light
Infantry Training & Guidance Bureau Cheonmaho tank

Cheonmaho tank

(LITGB) numbering a total of 15 corpslevel units. In comparison to the end of the year 2006, it means that two
mechanized corps became two mechanized divisions, one tank corps
became one armored division and one artillery corps became one artillery
division. But in the aspect of war potential, there is no significant change
because they have maintained the corps level dimension.
North Korea deploys about 70 percent of its ground forces in the south of
the Pyongyang-Wonsan line. Currently, 170mm self-propelled artillery and
240mm multiple rocket launchers (MRLs) deployed in the frontline are
capable of carrying out a massive surprise bombardment on the Greater
Seoul metropolitan area from their current location.
In addition, the North Korean Army has produced upgraded tanks
(Cheonmaho) and deployed them in the armored and mechanized units.
The current holdings of major weapons in the North Korean Army are
shown in Figure 1-5.

Section 3 North Korean Situation and Military Threat

Recently, the Army reorganized unit structures by reinforcing the fire
power of the first echelon in the frontline area, thereby attaining a surprise
effect with overwhelming combat power in the initial engagement.
In addition, the troop strength for special
warfare reaches approximately 180,000 by
creating light infantry divisions in the forward area and augmenting the light infantry battalions to regiment-class. The Army
is concentrating massively on enhancing their Special warfare forces

Special warfare forces

capabilities of special warfare as evidenced
by the stepping up of night-time, mountaineering training and street warfare.
The strengthening of special warfare capabilities of North Korea reflects the
lessons learned from the Iraq War. It can also be inferred that the North
intends to execute multifarious types of attacks and mixed warfare
simultaneously by infiltrating rear areas of the ROK in contingency through
underground tunnels, etc. By utilizing special warfare forces, the North
Korea military will support offensive operations of main forces, and try to
harass our forces in the rear areas.
North Korea is stepping up measures to enhance the survivability in its rear
areas. The North has greatly camouflaged military facilities and equipment
while setting up a large number of fake armaments. They are taking steps to
evade precision guided munitions (PGMs) by developing varied electronic
jamming and deception devices. Also, as a result of having constructed
hardened underground sites in a large number of widespread regions in the
front-rear areas for a long period of time under the banner of “turning the
whole nation into a fortress,”it is possible to shelter most of their equipment
and facilities.


B. Navy
The North Korean Navy consists of two fleet commands in the East and
West Seas, 13 squadrons, and two maritime sniper brigades under the Navy
Command. The status of major naval vessels is shown in Figure 1-6.

infiltration midget submarines, which are capable of emplacing mines,
attacking the ROK’s surface vessels, or secretly infiltrating commandos into
the South.

Also operated by the Navy are landing vessels such as air cushion
personnel landing craft (LCPA), personnel landing craft, and mine sweeping

The Navy retains two maritime sniper brigades and about 260 troop
transport vessels including 130 LCPAs and 90 personnel landing craft.
The North Korean Navy is increasingly strengthening submarine forces,
and developing surface-to-ship and ship-to-ship missiles as well as new types
of torpedoes. Additionally, the Navy has built command automation systems,

connecting networks between appropriate equipment from fleet commands
down to combat vessels.


C. Air Force
The North Korean Air Force comprises four air divisions, two tactical
transportation brigades, two sniper brigades, and ground anti-aircraft units
under the direct control of the Air Force Command. The North Korean
inventory of aircraft is shown in Figure 1-7.
Combat aircraft are deployed into four divided districts of North Korea,

about 40 percent of which are deployed in forward bases located to the
south of the Pyongyang-Wonsan line. They maintain their capabilities and
posture to launch a surprise attack. In particular, the North has AN-2s and
helicopters capable of low speed, low altitude flight. These aircraft can easily
infiltrate the special warfare forces deep into the South’s rear areas.
The Air Force operates a large number of air bases including reserve bases

and contingency runways. These bases are in addition to the 20 operational
bases already in operation. Most of these operational bases have shelters

such as underground hangars to enhance their survivability.
The Noth’s surface-to-air missile units deploy long-range high altitude SA-5
missiles to the east and the west. SA-2/3 missiles are densely deployed in
defense of the whole Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) area, east and west coasts,
and Pyongyang area. Though most of the surface-to-air missiles are
deployed in fixed launching bases, the trend shows that mobile launchers
are additionally being deployed.
The radar units are capable of detecting
aircraft flying in North and South Korea,
and even some parts of China by dividing
these areas into four sectors. The Air Force

operations effectively.


D. Reserve Forces
As one gigantic “garrison society,”North
Korea has succeeded in arming the entire
population in accordance with the FourPoint Military Guidelines. In particular,
having seen the Iraq War, North Korea is
placing an emphasis upon the importance Worker and Peasant Red Guards
of the Reserve Military Training Unit
(RMTU) in the rear area and enhancing its combat capabilities.
The RMTU retains armaments similar to those of active units and
undergoes intensive training so as to replace the regular forces at wartime.
All troops under the RMTU attend mobilization training at least twice for two
months a year so that they can complete combat readiness within 24 hours
once the mobilization order is given.
Civilians between the ages of 14 and 60, or approximately 30 percent of
the entire population, are subject to wartime mobilization in North Korea.
Currently, the reserve troops number some 7.7 million. The status of reserve

E. Development of Strategic Weapons

(1) Nuclear Development
In the 1960s, North Korea constructed the
nuclear complex in Yongbyon, and in the 1970s,
concentrated its nuclear research on nuclear fuel
milling, conversion, and fabrication technologies.
Since the 1980s, based on the extraction of
nuclear material through operating the 5megawatt reactor and reprocessing the spent fuel Solidified plutonium
rods, Pyongyang had completed the “nuclear fuel
cycle”[23)] comprising a series of steps ranging from the acquisition of nuclear
fuel to the reprocessing.
It is estimated that the North has secured about 40 kg of plutonium as a
result of three reprocessing procedures. Pyongyang conducted the nuclear
test in October 2006.
As for the promotion of the highly enriched uranium (HEU) program,


23) Nuclear Fuel Cycle:

uranium ore is processed in
a reactor after mining and

Chapter 1 Changes and Challenges in Security Environment

despite the North’s denial, various suspicions have been raised. In this
regard, the ROK government is carefully pursuing relevant information in
close cooperation with the countries concerned, including the United States.


(2) Ballistic Missiles
North Korea had embarked on a project to develop ballistic missiles in the
1970s, and in the mid-1980s, it domestically produced and deployed 300 kmrange Scud-Bs and 500 km-range Scud-Cs. In the 1990s Pyongyang
succeeded in test-firing a 1,300 km-range Rodong missile and deployed
Rodong missiles for operational purposes.
By the end of the 1990s, the North began to develop new intermediate
range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) which can reach beyond 3,000 km. The
North recently has deployed them for operational purposes.
In August 1998, Pyongyang conducted an unsuccessful test-launch of a
Taepodong-1 missile. Although the attempt failed, the North has tested the
missile’s general functions including engine combustion, multi-stage body
separation, etc. From the test, it can be inferred that North Korea has the
capability to develop medium and long-range missiles.
Presently, Pyongyang is developing Taepodong-2, a long-range ballistic
missile. After the test-launch failure on July 5, 2006, it is thought that the

North is rectifying the defects.
The range of the Taepodong-2 is estimated to reach beyond 6,700 km,
which will be able to be extended if the weight of the delivery body is
reduced or if three stage booster rockets are additionally loaded.
The scope of the threat by this type of missile is shown in Figure 1-8.

(3) Biochemical Weapons
North Korea launched its chemical
weapons development program including the research and construction
of production facilities in compliance
with Kim Il Sung’s“Declaration for
Chemicalization”in December 1961.[24)]

It is assessed that the North has been

remain stored at the facilities scattered around the country. The North is also
suspected of being able to independently cultivate and produce such
biological weapons as the bacteria of anthrax, smallpox, and cholera.


F. War Sustainability
North Korea operates nationallevel logistics mobilization agencies to enhance capabilities for
logistics mobilization and war
sustainability.
The North retains about 300
logistics factories for the production of military supplies to prepare

Underground logistics factory

for wartime. Except for air and
electronics area, the North is self-sufficient in weapons development, and
can continue to advance the system of war supplies production.
Most of the produced war stocks are kept in the hardened underground
storing facilities. The export of this materiel out of these storing facilities is
thoroughly managed and controlled, and is only possible with the supreme
commander’s approval.
The stockpile of core war supplies has been a top priority despite the
economic difficulties since the mid 1990s. In particular, the quantities of
major war stocks such as petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL), munitions, et
cetera are estimated to last for two or three months.

Section1.

National Security Strategy Guidelines


The national security strategy is a comprehensive and systematic initiative for achieving

our national security objectives by mobilizing the nation’s available means and resources.

The Lee administration set the catch phrase “To Develop a Country that Stands Tall in

the World through Advancement” as the vision for the nation and is pointing to a “Global

Korea.”[1) ]To realize this vision in the field of security, the Lee administration presents the

“National Security Strategy Guidelines.”

The ROK Ministry of National Defense (MND) will focus all its defense resources on

achieving national security objectives and supporting national policies.


1) Global Korea
Beyond current diplomacy
and security strategies
focusing on North Korea’s
nuclear weapons and the
Korean Peninsula, the ROK
should cooperate with
countries around the world
on various issues including
economy, culture, and the
environment making a
contribution to world peace
and co-development. This is
a vision that the ROK
government is pursuing in
the national security area,
and is one of five national
policies including lively
market economy, active
welfare, country rich in
talent, and government
serving the people.

1. The Vision for the Nation and National Security
Objectives

The Lee administration set the catch
phrase, “Develop a Country that Stands
Tall in the World through Advancement”as the vision for the nation based
on liberal democracy and market
principles that drive Korea’s basic
constitutional ideology. This is the long
(National Assembly, February 25, 2008)17th Presidential Inauguration term national vision that Korea should

pursue to live up to the spirit of the
times. The goal is to make a country that is respected globally through the

advancement of the economy and the enhancement of the quality of life as
well as by meeting and helping to raise international standards.
The national security objectives are those that must be attained through an
accurate assessment of the current security environment and available
national resources. The government laid out the national security objectives
as described herein: (1) maintaining stability and peace on the Korean
Peninsula; (2) building firmly the foundation for the nation’s security and
national prosperity; and (3) enhancing competence and status internationally.
First, maintaining stability and peace on the Korean Peninsula: the ROK
should maintain stability on the Korean Peninsula based on our defense
capabilities and the ROK-U.S. alliance; and the peace on the Korean
Peninsula should be secured through inter-Korean exchanges and
cooperation along with diverse cooperation with neighboring countries.
Second, building a firm foundation for the nation’s security and national
prosperity: people’s lives should be protected from various security threats;
and economic social safety that is the foundation of national prosperity must
be secured.
Third, improving international competence and status: the ROK should
contribute to world peace, liberal democracy, and co-prosperity; and the
ROK must make a leap forward in order to become a soft power[2)] through
enhancing cooperation with the international society.

2. Tenets of National Security Strategy


2) Soft Power
This is an advanced country
that has a strong economic
and cultural power based on
its national power, and is a
soft but strong country that
contributes actively to stability on the Korean Peninsula
and East Asia, and world
peace.

45


To achieve national security objectives, the government shaped the
following three strategic tenets: (1) creating a new peace structure; (2)
carrying out pragmatic diplomacy and active openness; and (3) seeking
enhanced security for the world.
First, creating a new peace structure should be achieved by the following:
advancing the inter-Korea relationship in a future-oriented way to achieve


-----

Chapter 2 National Security Strategy and Defense Policy

mutual benefits; pursuing the 21st century strategic alliance with the United
States to contribute to the peace on the Korean Peninsula, regional stability,
and also world peace based on common values, benefits, and mutual trust;
and constructing a close and cooperative relationship with neighboring
countries.
Second, in order to carry out pragmatic diplomacy and active openness,
the ROK should put more emphasis on diplomatic capabilities to revitalize
the economy and build foundations for economic growth; the ROK must
also pursue international cooperation and contribution corresponding to its
economic size and diplomatic capability.
Third, in seeking an advanced security for the world, the ROK should put
more efforts on the following: building military capabilities and advanced
defense operating systems to respond to the changes in the security
environment and future warfare; acquiring competence in the
comprehensive security area to take action against various security threats;
and participating in international peacekeeping operations and
reconstruction projects.
In order to realize these tenets of the national security strategy, the
government is implementing strategic tasks in each area. The main strategic
task in the national defense area is to build a future-oriented security
capability. To achieve this goal, MND set the development of an “Elite and
Advanced Military”as its vision and is focusing all of its resources upon
realizing it. At the same time, MND evaluates and develops the Defense
Reform Basic Plan that was established in 2005.

Section 2 National Defense Policy

Section2. National Defense Policy


MND has set national defense objectives to accomplish national security objectives in

fast changing security environments. To this end, MND presents a national defense

vision and the tenets of national defense policy to carry out relevant policies in a

consistent manner.

1. National Defense Objectives


MND has set defense objectives as follows: defending the nation from
external military threats and invasion, upholding the principle of peaceful
unification, and contributing to regional stability and world peace. The
specific meanings of those objectives are as follows:
First, “defending the nation from external military threats and invasion”
signifies protecting the country not only from North Korea’s existing military

Major military commanders’meeting (December 8, 2008)

Chapter 2 National Security Strategy and Defense Policy

threats but also from all other potential threats. In particular, North Korea’s
conventional military capabilities, development and enhancement of WMDs
such as nuclear and missiles, and forward military deployment pose direct
and serious threats to our national security.
Second, “upholding the principle of peaceful unification”means
contributing to a peaceful unification of the two Koreas by deterring war,
easing military tension, and bringing a permanent peace to the Korean
Peninsula.
Third, “contributing to regional stability and world peace”demonstrates
the ROK’s determination to contribute to stability and peace in Northeast Asia
by promoting cordial and cooperative military relations with neighboring
countries in accordance with the ROK’s national stature and security
capabilities. The ROK also seeks to actively participate in the international
community’s efforts to maintain world peace, including UN peacekeeping
efforts.


2. Tenets of National Defense Policy

MND has set the development of an “Elite and Advanced Military”as its
vision to realize the objectives of national security and national defense.
Presented here are the key tenets of national defense policy that are geared
towards achieving national defense objectives and vision.


Our armed forces of 60 years

history should be reborn as an

elite and advanced military .

⑵Advance ROK-U.S. military alliance ⑹Establish a pragmatic and advanced
creatively defense management system

⑶Enhance advanced defense ⑺Improve the quality of life
capabilities corresponding to national

development

⑷Provide military support to realize a
new peace structure on the Korean ⑻Pursue armed forces that serve the
Peninsula people


A. Establishment of Defense Posture[3)] for Comprehensive
Security
The ROK Armed Forces should achieve a comprehensive security posture
by being prepared to take action no matter when, where or what situations
occur, and should establish an all-directional defense posture against not
only North Korea’s military threats but against all other threats across the
spectrum.
That is, the military should establish an all-directional defense posture to
deter North Korea’s military provocation and win every battle when military
provocations occur. To concentrate resources in a national crisis or
emergency, MND should develop an integrated defense system where
citizens, governments, and armed forces work together.
At the same time, enhanced spiritual education for service members is
needed to raise strong soldiers armed with a clear vision of country and
enemy.

B. Creative Advancement in the ROK-U.S. Military Alliance
The ROK and the U.S. not only fought together in the Korean War, but
also recognize each other as a respective military partner. Further, both
nations should creatively advance a future-oriented alliance based on shared
values, trust, and legitimacy of the Alliance.[4)]

The ROK-U.S. alliance should be expanded to cover politics, economy,


3) Defense Posture
Comprehensive readiness
against threats by using
national defense means,
capabilities, and facilities.

4) Legitimacy of the Alliance
The ROK-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty (signed on
October 1, 1953) clearly
states that the ROK and the
U.S. shall jointly deter
external armed attack and
contribute to the stability and
peace of the ROK and the
region. Legitimacy of the
alliance implies the characteristics and meaning of the
ROK-U.S. alliance which is
based on the ROK-U.S.
Mutual Defense Treaty.

society, and culture as well as military based on shared values and trust. The
alliance must be developed to make a contribution to regional and global
peace as well as prosperity.


President Bush and I agreed that

the scope of the Alliance needs to be

expanded to encompass not only

military and security affairs,

but also politics, economy, society

and culture


Opening remarks by President Lee Myung-bak
at a joint press conference following a summit
with U.S. President George W. Bush
(August 6, 2008)

MND will provide quality stationing conditions for the United States Forces
Korea (USFK) and promote mutual trust by expanding ROK-U.S. policy
coordination. The ROK and the U.S. should build a new alliance military
structure in accordance with the transfer of wartime operational control.


C. Enhancement in Advanced Defense Capabilities
MND should reshape the armed
forces for post-unification as well as
the current hostile relationship between the two Koreas and improve
international capabilities in order to
realize a “Global Korea.”
The Defense Reform Basic Plan
should be adjusted taking into ac
2008 ROK Navy International Fleet Review(Busan, October 7, 2008) count changes in security situations

and required budgets. “Integration”
and “jointness”should be reinforced for military structure, which should in
turn be developed to include information/knowledge-based technologyintensive structure suitable for future warfare. Force structure should be

advanced to be able to respond actively to various security threats. By
improving mobilization systems and reserve forces training programs, the
reserve forces should be advanced to meet the level of standing forces.
Also, based on the ROK-U.S. alliance, MND should develop cooperative
military relationships with neighboring countries, expand military diplomacy
to a global level, and enhance international peacekeeping operations.


D. Military Support for a New Peace Structure on the Korean
Peninsula
MND should take timely military measures according to the inter-Korean
exchanges and cooperation by developing and initiating creative agendas
and strategies to alleviate military tensions and build trust.
The government is working hard to take the South-North relationship to
the next level through exchanges and cooperation for mutual benefit and
common prosperity. Therefore, while providing military assurance for the
inter-Korean exchanges and cooperation, MND should maintain a firm
military readiness posture. The Ministry should build military trust and
pursue arms control step by step to facilitate peace on the Korean Peninsula.
The matter of the ROK prisoners of war (POWs) must be carried out as a
national responsibility. Accordingly, MND should prepare government-level
plans and carry out negotiations with North Korea.

E. Professional Armed Forces Playing their Roles Faithfully
MND should build professional armed forces which can respond to both
present and future threats by eliminating ostentatious and unnecessary
bureaucratic elements and creating strong and powerful military spirits.
The manpower structure and personnel management system should be
reformed to secure and manage superb human resources required for
technology-intensive armed forces that can respond actively to future threats.
In the field of education and training, troops should be trained and educated
by using a scientific system so that they can become elite soldiers suitable to
perform in future warfare.


51


-----

Chapter 2 National Security Strategy and Defense Policy


F. Pragmatic and Advanced Defense Management System
MND should enhance centralized support capability of the noncombat
management area,[5)] so that uniformed service members can concentrate
only on their combat missions. The Ministry should not only attain a higher
efficiency of national defense architecture and management, but also
maximize the eufunctions of the defense industry and defense budget upon
the national economy.
The national defense resource management system should be developed
to maximize the efficiency of logistics and management and to be suitable for
future warfare. The noncombat management area should streamline its
structure and manpower and improve its efficiency by benchmarking the
private fields that are relatively more efficient. For the defense industry,
relevant systems should be improved and the supporting foundation should
be strengthened to develop the defense industry as a new growth engine for
the national economy. Also, by leveraging world-class national information
technology capabilities, MND should establish an advanced network-centric
informatization environment.

G. Improvement of the Quality of Life
MND should gradually improve barrack environments to an advanced
level by integrating and relocating military bases and building accordant
infrastructures to provide better training and welfare befitting the professional
soldiers.
The Ministry should advance military service environments and welfare
systems to make soldiers satisfied with their military life and improve
professional soldiers’quality of life. The military medical service system
should be upgraded to make soldiers healthier for stronger combat
capability.
At the same time, MND should help veterans’job-seeking efforts and
manage the military pension system.


5) Noncombat Management Area
This is synonymous with the
combat support field. Combat support means all support, administrative and
logistics activities that are
not included in tactics and
strategies but are used to
provide and manage all
necessary resources (manpower, equipment, materials, facilities, funds, etc.) for
combat units.

52


-----

Section 2 National Defense Policy

H. Armed Forces serving the People
MND should enable the armed forces to focus on their original missions
and strengthen overall capabilities to garner trust from the nation, guarantee
people’s convenience, and realize government policies actively to firmly
establish an image of the “citizen in uniform.”
The Ministry should build an advanced barracks culture so that service
members can undertake their duties with high morale and a spirit of pride.
The disaster and catastrophe response system should be developed and
relevant regulations should be eased to enhance public benefits and protect
public rights. Especially, in the case of disaster and catastrophe, MND should
provide active support for disaster-stricken civilians to secure their lives and
eliminate discomfort. The military service system should be developed to
utilize national human resources efficiently and promote equality in fulfilling
military service duties.
At the same time, MND should increase compensations for those who
sacrificed themselves for the country, in order to cherish and honor their
noble sacrifice.

Section1.

All-dimensional Military Readiness Posture


The ROK military is developing all-dimensional military readiness posture and

capabilities to counter various threats including North Korea.

The military is reorganizing its force structure to be technology-intensive and modern.

The military is maintaining a high readiness posture based on the ROK-U.S. combined

defense system to effectively respond to North Korean military provocations and other

threats.

1. Military Organizations and Forces


A. Consolidation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) has four central directorates and two assistant
chiefs of staff. Figure 3-1 shows its major organizations. JCS is responsible for
conducting operational command and supervising the units under the
command, and for performing combined and joint operations by

commanding joint units[1)] that are organized to carry out joint operations.
JCS is carrying out its reorganization process to have the ability of an
independent defense planning and operations system under its command in
connection with the proposed wartime operational control (OPCON)
transition. In 2006, JCS began to enlarge its core organizations including
intelligence and operations.[2)] JCS will continue to reshuffle its organization
until 2012 with a specific plan prepared in 2008.
Following the reorganization of the structure, JCS is making various efforts
to strengthen “jointness”[3)] to effectively respond to the change of future
warfare and the strategic environment.
By publishing The Joint Concept in 2006, JCS has firmly established the
Joint Operating Concept (JOC) in preparation for future warfare. JCS is also
building a Joint Combat Development system based on the nexus of “joint
concept,”[4)] experimentation, and combat development. JCS intends to
develop a Joint Combat Development System that is suitable to Korea’s
warfighting environment. For that purpose, JCS will develop methods of
combat execution in stages based on the concept of network centric warfare
(NCW),[5)] and develop required capabilities. Simultaneously, JCS will
improve the joint military education system and develop a joint doctrine. JCS
has a plan to operate a Jointness Committee and reorganize the Joint Staff
College into an agency dedicated to reinforcing “jointness.”

B. Force Capability of Individual Services


1) Joint Unit

one Operations Command, Capital Defense Command, Special Warfare
Command, Aviation Operations Command, and Guided Missile Command
and their supporting units. Major organizations and forces are shown in
Figure 3-2.


5) Network Centric Warfare
(NCW)
Introduced in 1998, NCW is
a new method of conducting warfare which utilizes
information technology and
network communication
technologies to enhance the
sharing of information for
greater mission effectiveness.

(TPFDD).[21) ]

FDOs are ready to be implemented when war is imminent. They can be
classified into diplomatic, intelligence, military, and economic (DIME)
options. Approximately 130 deterrence options are ready to be employed.
FMPs are measures that augment combat or combat support units that need the most
support in the early phase of
the war should war deterrence
efforts through FDOs fail.
Included in the FMPs are elements such as rapid deploy

Section 1 All-dimensional Military Readiness Posture


2. Military Readiness Posture

A. Early Warning and Crisis Management Systems
The ROK Armed Forces maintains 24-hour surveillance and operates an
early warning system over the Korean Peninsula and its adjunct islands,
including North Korea. For this purpose, the ROK military operates ROKU.S. combined intelligence assets, including signal and image assets and
satellites. Furthermore, the military also preemptively identifies indications of
potential threats to Korea’s security and disseminates them in real time
through the information distribution system.
The ROK Ministry of National Defense (MND) is reinforcing its overall
defense system to effectively counter the diverse types of crises. Primarily,
MND has prepared 11 manuals relating to crisis management. It also
integrated its crisis management organizations by function. In late 2008, the
Ministry extensively amended its Defense Crisis Management Instructions.
The Republic of Korea and the United States jointly prepare for threats
through close cooperation from an incipient stage by establishing a
combined crisis management system. Thus, the two countries are equipped
with a system that enables the leadership to make swift decisions and actions
by integrating diverse information within a short period of time in
contingencies. In addition, the two countries also periodically complement
their consultation system by routinely carrying out ROK-U.S. combined crisis
management exercises in times of peace. Meanwhile, the two countries are
also preparing for a combined crisis management system through mutual
consultation in order to be ready when the wartime OPCON is transferred to
the ROK JCS.


B. Readiness Posture against Infiltration and Local
Provocation
North Korea is continuing its provocative acts against South Korea,
including invasion into the Northern Limit Line (NLL), trespassing the
demilitarized zone (DMZ), and firing at the ROK guard posts (GP).


63


-----

Chapter 3 Defense Posture for Comprehensive Security

The ROK Armed Forces is tracking or monitoring North Korean army
movements 24 hours a day and maintaining an operational termination
posture on ground, sea and air. The ROK military will prevent escalation by
executing operations in a swift manner by taking powerful action in any
situation, at anytime, in anywhere based on the rules of engagement (ROE).
The ROK military has especially arranged for the capability to counter
North Korean provocation in the northwestern waters at all times. The ROK
military maintains an operation posture that can effectively counter North
Korean provocation with joint combat capability pursuant to the Rules of
Engagement. Meanwhile, the ROK Navy operates a communication system
between South and North Korean navy ships pursuant to the 2004 SouthNorth Korea General Officer-level Talks agreement to prevent contingent
military collisions.
The military has developed its alert system by increasing scientific
surveillance equipment rather than
troops in order to strengthen its
readiness in the DMZ and vulnerable
areas. In addition, it provides military
assurance on inter-Korean exchanges
and cooperation, but still maintains
an immediate operational response
posture against any contingencies Defending Dokdo Exercise(near Dokdo in July 2008)
expected in connection with such
exchanges.
Furthermore, the ROK Armed Forces maintains complete readiness posture
to firmly safeguard the five islands in the northwestern sea and national
territory in the eastern, western, and southern seas including Marado,
Ulleungdo, and Dokdo.

C. Readiness Posture against General War
The ROK-U.S. Combined Forces maintain a perfect readiness posture
against general war in case of North Korean provocation to secure the safety
of the Greater Seoul Metropolitan Area (GSMA) and to dominate the
battlefield at an early stage.
The ROK-U.S. Combined Forces also maintain a combined crisis
management system and early warning system that may enable a 24-hours-aday surveillance of the entire Korean Peninsula in preparation against any
possible military provocation by North Korea. The ROK-U.S. Combined
Forces also continue their efforts to deter such provocations by maintaining
combat readiness at all times.
Both the ROK and U.S. have established a firm combined defense system
in connection with the transfer of wartime OPCON. To that end, they have


65


-----

Chapter 3 Defense Posture for Comprehensive Security


been developing preparatory plans reflecting the following: first,
countermeasures and the availability of U.S. augmentation forces in relation
to the changing North Korean threats including weapons of mass destruction
(WMD); second, such combat execution concepts as effects-based
operations (EBO),[23)] information operations (IO),[24)] and NCW; and third,
new developments of military capabilities such as command, control,
communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
(C4ISR), and precision guided munitions (PGMs).
Both the ROK and U.S. are also establishing doctrines that may maximize
the joint and combined operational capabilities. In addition, the two nations
are carrying out practical joint/combined training and exercises.

D. Readiness Posture against Terrorist Attack
The risk of a terrorist attack is on the increase at home and abroad as
witnessed by the kidnappings of Christian evangelical missionaries in
Afghanistan and the Mabuno in Somali waters in 2007. The ROK military has
strengthened its capabilities and readiness posture for immediate response
against various types of terrorist threats.
First, counter-terrorism planning function has been enhanced. In June
2008, the Implementation Manual on Responses to Terrorism on Military
Installations was prepared to enable practical actions against terrorist attacks
on military installations. Also, MND has revised the Working Manual on
Actions against Terrorism based on the Standard Government Manual on the
Management of Terrorism and Other Crises.
Second, the ROK military is becoming fully equipped with capabilities to
carry out effective counter-terrorism operations, updating the equipment of
counter-terrorism task forces, and pushing forward with the deployment of a
comprehensive database of counter-terrorism equipments and materiel.
Furthermore, the military has improved inter-governmental information
sharing and cooperation among the related agencies, including the National
Intelligence Service (NIS), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MOFAT),
the National Police Agency (NPA), and the National Emergency Management


23) Effects-based Operations (EBO)
A concept of operations that
accomplish pre-determined
desired effects by applying
all military and non-military
capabilities in a consolidated
manner while minimizing
unnecessary mass destruction.

24) Information Operations
(IO)
Operations for defending
friendly information and
intelligence systems by
consolidating all available
means in war and peace
time, while attacking or
affecting enemy information
and intelligence systems in
order to achieve information
superiority.

Agency (NEMA).
Third, the military has developed
counter-terrorism training systems by
systematizing joint exercises between
government agencies affiliated with
counter-terrorism Special Forces, and crisis
management training under the sponsorship of the JCS. The ROK military has also
intensified on-site inspections while
applying training models and techniques
developed to suit changing operational
conditions.

3. Readiness Posture for Rapid Mobilization[25)]

Modern warfare is a total war for which the government makes maximum
use of all national personnel, materials, and resources. The ROK Armed
Forces employs a rapid mobilization posture to efficiently mobilize the
nation’s available resources in wartime.


25) Mobilization
Exercise of government
authority to efficiently manage and control manpower,
materials, goods and services to achieve objectives in
incidents of national security
when a war or comparable
national emergency occurs.

26) Companies Designated
for Mobilization (CDM)
Business enterprises that
have been designated as
enterprises to be mobilized
in order to carry out given
missions according to the
wartime mobilization plan.


A. Manpower Mobilization
Manpower mobilization constitutes essential troops required for units in
action, secures needed personnel for military operations, and mobilizes
additional human resources to convey missions of government agencies and
companies designated for mobilization.[26)] It is broken down into personnel
mobilization, wartime labor service mobilization, and technician
mobilization.
Personnel mobilization refers to mobilizing human resources to be used as
combat personnel of military units as required for expansion (augmentation
or establishment) of military units or for replenishing their losses. MND has
designated and manages elite resources to ensure efficiency in wartime


67


-----

Chapter 3 Defense Posture for Comprehensive Security


personnel mobilization. The assembly areas have been grouped by region in
order to enhance timeliness. Personnel mobilization has become more
efficient by allowing each Regional Military Personnel Administration to
supply manpower to frontline corps that has suffered large casualties.
Furthermore, MND has improved its procedure for wartime emergency
mobilization, systems for issuing notices of call for operational mobilization,
promotion of homeland reserve force leaders, and the transportation and
convoy of mobilized manpower.
Wartime labor service mobilization refers to mobilizing personnel that
carry out wartime labor duties to support military operations, damage
recovery, and transportation of supplies and ammunition. MND has
improved efficiency in mission performance by switching the conscripts from
second eligible conscription status[27)] to replacement status[28)] who can serve
as an active duty personnel. MND will continue to review and complement
the requirements for wartime labor service mobilization in the future.
Technician mobilization involves mobilizing personnel who hold
government-issued technical qualification certificates. The personnel carry
out operations or maintenance of equipment to support combat or combat
service activities. MND has stepped up its cooperation with the Ministry of
Public Administration and Safety (MOPAS) and Local Government
Administration Offices to mobilize persons with technical qualification
certificates in new technology or information service areas.

B. Materiel Mobilization
Materiel mobilization supports military operations and ensures war
sustainability by mobilizing such resources as commodities, equipment,
facilities, and entities held by the civilian sector and government at the
appropriate time and place. It is broken down into mobilization of industry,
transportation, construction, and communication.
Industrial mobilization refers to “mobilization”or “management of control”[29)]

of materials (food, clothing, petrol, materials for construction, ammunition,
medical supplies, parts for repair, etc.) and targets such as maintenance and


27) Second Eligible Conscription Status
Those who have been
determined to be able to
perform military support
service under wartime labor
service mobilization, even if
they are found not to be fit
to perform active duty or
replacement through physical examination for conscription.

28) Replacement Status
Those judged to be fit for
active duty, but excluded
from active duty or have
been assigned to mandatory
public service because of
supply and demand circumstances for personnel.


29) Management of Control
This refers to control imposed on business enterprises
that are mobilized for control
of their production, repair,
processing, and distribution
processes to accomplish
mobilization objectives. The
business enterprises are
allowed to retain autonomy
for its operations other than
those controlled.

68

Section 1 All-dimensional Military Readiness Posture


repair service providers (general equipment, aircraft, and ships, etc.),
promotional media, and hospitals. MND has deployed a government-wide
joint resources survey system in cooperation with government ministries
responsible for managing resources. The Ministry has made companies
designated for mobilization (CDM) familiarized with their wartime mission
procedures by gradually extending the production drill of appointed
companies for mobilization. Furthermore, MND reassigned the mobilization
of materials service in the First and Third ROK Army (FROKA/TROKA)
regions from the Logistics Command to the military units with assigned
missions.[30)] MND plans to expand designation of resources for mobilization
by continually identifying those consumer commodities that are
interoperable with those of the military.
Transportation mobilization refers to
“mobilization for use”[31)] or “management
of control”of transportation equipment
(automobiles, vessels, and aircraft, etc.) and
companies for maintenance, transport,
loading and unloading of such equipment.

Mobilization of materials drill

MND has enhanced the mobilization ratio
by designating resources in other cities or provinces for regions where
resources are insufficient. In case of helicopters, the scope of designation has
been extended by adding business enterprises to the existing individual
mobilization.
Construction mobilization refers to “mobilization for use”or “management
of control”of the buildings, land, construction equipment, maintenance
service providers and construction companies. The military has shortened
the mobilization time by mobilizing the latest-model equipment, tiremounted mobile equipment or equipment available in areas near the units
that will use them. In the future, MND plans to utilize civilian repair and
transport service providers by designating them for mobilization according to
a plan for extending outsourcing to the private sector.
Communication mobilization refers to “mobilization for use”or


30) Military Unit with
Assigned Mission
Brigade or higher units that

“management of control”of the general communication (domestic and
international circuits), satellite communication circuits and information and
telecommunication service providers. MND is extending the mobilization
scope to civilian broadband service providers and information technology
companies in order to maximize the capability to support smooth command,
control, and communication capabilities during wartime.

Section 2 Integrated Civil-Governmental-Military Defense Posture

Section2. Integrated Civil-GovernmentalMilitary Defense Posture


Threat from North Korea is still continuing while non-military threats such as terrorism,

disaster, and catastrophes are also on the rise.

The ROK Ministry of National Defense (MND) has developed an integrated civil,

governmental, and military defense posture with the aim of utilizing all available capabilities

in contingency in order to actively cope with diversified threats to national security .

Accordingly, MND has established the integrated civil, governmental, and military

defense system to ensure effective military command, close cooperation and support,

and is enforcing the relevant laws and regulations to that end. It is also preparing the

necessary infrastructure and training conditions to enhance the integrated defense

operational posture.

1. Integrated Defense System


Due to the increase in request for larger roles and functions for regional
security by heads of local autonomous entities, succeeding the
implementation of the local autonomy system in 1995, the government has
been advancing the integrated defense system to firmly secure the local
security posture.
The integrated defense system is comprised of the Integrated Defense
Headquarters, the Central (Regional) Integrated Defense Committees, and
the Integrated Defense Supporting Headquarters. Figure 3-6 shows the
system of command and cooperation under the integrated defense system.


71


-----

Chapter 3 Defense Posture for Comprehensive Security

The Integrated Defense Headquarters is the office of primary responsibility
for integrated defense missions, chaired by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff (JCS). Its main missions are to formulate and coordinate policies for
integrated defense, to ascertain and supervise the integrated defense posture,
to conduct general analyses of the situations of integrated defense operations
and present counter-measures, to provide directions for operations and
training for integrated defense, and to coordinate and control their
execution.
The Central Integrated Defense Committee is the top decision-making
organization in connection with integrated defense, which belongs to the
Office of the Prime Minister. It deliberates and votes on the national
integrated defense policy, directions for operations and training for
integrated defense, and the announcement of an integrated defense
situation.

The Local Integrated Defense Committees are controlled by mayors and
governors of 16 metropolises and provinces, including the mayor of Seoul as
well as mayors of smaller cities and heads of district (gu) offices. They
deliberate and decide on integrated defense counter-measures, the
announcement of integrated defense situations, and integrated defense
operations and their supportive measures for its training.
The Integrated Defense Supporting Headquarters are controlled by
mayors, governors, county administrators, and district (or eup, myeon, and
dong) office heads. Their major functions and duties are as follows:
establishing the plans for provision of support for integrated defense related
operations and exercises; operating the
situation rooms; providing support for
national defense elements including
military, police, reserve forces, local
governments, and the civil defense corps;
and establishing a reporting system of

The government holds the Central (Regional) Integrated Defense Council
once a year to appraise the status of measures taken concerning the
integrated defense posture on a central and local level in an effort to
maintain the integrated defense posture.


2. Integrated Defense Operations Posture

In the cases of enemy infiltration or provocation, the integrated defense
operation procedure is as follows. First, the mayor or governor announces
the integrated defense situation as the chairman of the Regional Integrated
Defense Committee via authorization of the Regional Integrated Defense
Council. Second, the mayor or governor appoints the local police agency’s
commissioner or the local military commander as the local integrated defense

operations commander. Third, the operations commander carries out his
duty, integrating all national defense elements and unifying all command
systems into one. At the same time, the mayor or governor operates the
Integrated Defense Supporting Headquarters and provides support for the
integrated defense operations.
The government is making diverse efforts to maintain a wholly-integrated
Civil-Governmental-Military Defense Posture at the local level, operating the
Integrated Defense General Situation Room to cope with emergency
situations in a timely manner. It is also developing a wide area network for
video tele-conference (VTC) and interactive broadcast between local
situation rooms.
To enhance the protection capability of national key facilities, self-defense
plans by each facility have been refurbished along with surveillance assets,
situation rooms, and monitoring facilities. The military and police are also
developing an integrated defense plan for densely populated areas and
further strengthening related drills. Especially in 2007, factors in integrated
defense training such as control, evaluation, content, and time management
were reinforced.


3. Homeland Defense Operations Posture

Homeland defense operations are
carried out by mobilizing the Homeland
Reserve Forces in cooperation with civilians, the government, and the military.
They aim to protect important local facilities and military supply lines from enemy
attack, which include those from armed Carrying out Homeland DefenseOperations

carrying out operations to protect the homeland during both times of war
and peace.
The organization of the Homeland Reserve Forces has been undergoing an
overhaul on a continual basis to maintain a high level of efficiency in
homeland defense operations. Up until 2008, with the number of reserve
forces and local conditions under consideration, 95 local reserve companies
were reorganized and integrated, and 74 local units[32)] of Homeland Reserve
Forces were organized. Moreover, 21 mobile units were additionally
organized in urban areas to secure a higher level of operational flexibility. In
2007 and 2008, there were changes in the status of 96 workplace reserve
forces (i.e. nine were newly established; 14 were upgraded; 14 were
downgraded; and 59 were disbanded).

Continual efforts are made to ensure support for homeland defense
operations of the Homeland Reserve Forces. Such efforts include
modernization of arms and establishment of objectives by units and items to
secure combat gear in consideration of each unit’s duty and operational
environment.

In December 1967, MND enacted the Presidential
Directive on Counter-espionage Measures in
response to the North’s continuing infiltration and
provocation in the 1960’s. In January 1995, the
name was revised to the Integrated Defense Guide.
In January 1997, the Integrated Defense Act was

Section 3 Strengthening Spiritual Power

Section3. Strengthening Spiritual Power


Since soldiers must place their lives at risk in order to engage in combat duty upon

contingencies, they should be equipped with sound views on the nation, right views on

the enemy, and the esprit de corps.

As shown in recent surveys, young people’s national security awareness remains

unsatisfactory. Action is required to impart a mentality of patriotism and sound

consciousness about security to those who join the military. Thus, the ROK Ministry of

National Defense (MND) has set spiritual education for soldiers as one of the top

priorities for commanders and instructed them to carry out rigorous sessions of spiritual

education on combat readiness posture.

1. Meaning of Spiritual Power and Contents of
Spiritual Education


Spiritual power refers to the organized mental strength with which troops
carry out their assignments diligently and follow commanders’orders based
on firm belief, strict discipline, high morale, and strong unity.
In connection with the aim to establish a “solid all-directional military
readiness posture,”MND encourages military personnel to think of “what to
protect”(sound views on the nation), “who to fight against”(right views on
the enemy), and “how to carry out duties”(esprit de corps).
As Citizens in Uniform, troops are encouraged to take pride in the country’s
history based on the love of the homeland, the firm belief in the legitimacy
of the Republic of Korea, and the supremacy of a liberal, democratic system.

Chapter 3 Defense Posture for Comprehensive Security


“ Troops’sound views on the nation is the first

and foremost condition for an elite

and advanced military.”

President Lee Myung-bak making a speech
at the 64th graduation ceremony of the Korea Military Academy (March 11, 2008)


Troops should firmly recognize the need for national security measures
keeping in mind that the duty of the military is to protect the country from
those threatening its existence and interest. They are taught to look at the
duality of the current national security situation on the Korean Peninsula (i.e.
exchanges and cooperation amid military confrontation between the two
Koreas). They are also taught to pay attention to the Korean War and other
provocative acts perpetrated by the North, the current reality of the North
and its military threats against the South, and the significance of the ROKU.S. alliance for the country’s security.
MND does its best to instill six leading elements of soldiers’virtues[33)] that
form the basis of their mindset and can lead a country to victory in war. It
reinforces the fact that they may be forced to sacrifice their lives for the
country.


33) Six Leading Elements of
Soldiers’Virtues include
honor, loyalty, genuine courage, confidence in victory, a
“no retreat”mindset, and
patri-otism. These are the
values which the ROK military should forever adhere
to.

2. Spiritual Education System

Spiritual Education for officers is
conducted in two ways: in-school
education of spirit and unit’s education of spirit.

general security consciousness as well
as train their ability to provide spiritual
education to their subordinates. To

education and training with emphasis
placed on “making a true soldier.”In order for them to have the correct
sense of patriotism and national security consciousness, the military has
balanced each value in order to consolidate their sense of value as soldiers.
All members are subject to unit’s spiritual education that is conducted in
two sessions: regular-hour education and barrack-life education. Respective
experts educate on the issue of the motherland and national security.
Furthermore, the area of combative spirit is conducted as daily-life education
by commanders. Also, civilian experts are invited to give spiritual lectures to
the troops (a total of 4,116 sessions in 2007). The faculty members at the
National Defense University visit individual units for spiritual education (a
total of 4,553 sessions in 2007) in an effort to enhance the quality of overall
education.
MND examines relevant guidelines periodically to maintain the consistency
and unity of education and uses the modified Basic Texts for Spiritual
Education. In particular, it has constructed a system for the constant
production of educational materials using such mechanisms as the armed
forces TV. Therefore, in case of a major security issue, it is believed that


79


-----

Chapter 3 Defense Posture for Comprehensive Security

simultaneous education can be conducted to all troops throughout the nation
using the televised channel.
Diversified spiritual education programs are also being developed and
used. In keeping with the changing times and the trends of a new
generation, MND leads its troops to voluntarily participate under their own
belief. Promptness and efficiency are certainly upgraded by virtue of having
developed a cyber-infrastructure for spiritual education system in conformity
with the age of information technology and science.

Section1.

Future-oriented ROK-U.S. Military Alliance


Based on the Mutual Defense Treaty between the Republic of Korea and the United

States signed in 1953, the ROK-U.S. military alliance has played a pivotal role in

maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. The two nations will continue,

based on shared values of liberal democracy and market economy, to expand

cooperation and to develop a 21st Century strategic alliance that contributes to world

peace.

1. Development of the ROK-U.S. Alliance


The ROK-U.S. Alliance has evolved in response to its changing security
environments and U.S. global strategies.
Today, in addition to the conventional military threats, the world is facing
various security threats that include terrorism, natural disasters, and
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). In order to effectively
cope with these various threats, the U.S. is changing its global posture and
carrying out the military transformation that can maximize operational
efficiency and gurantee the rapid deployment of the troops. The United
States is transforming the once-stationary forces deployed overseas into a
flexible force equipped with enhanced mobility. Simultaneously, the U.S.
seeks to strengthen the effectiveness of its alliances with friendly states in
order to address global and regional concerns.
Korea has significantly elevated its worldwide reputation through


84


-----

Section 1 Future-oriented ROK-U.S. Military Alliance


sustaining economic growth and fortifying democracy. Such changes have
prompted South Koreans to increasingly voice out for a healthier and more
mature partnership with the U.S.
Reflecting such changes, the two nations are coordinating their Alliance
issues, an agenda based on mutual consultation that includes the United
States Forces Korea (USFK) mission transfer, re-sizing of forces, elevating the
recipient status of the ROK’s Foreign Military Sales (FMS) of U.S. weapon
systems, wartime operational control (OPCON) transition, and relocation of
USFK installations.
In accordance with the Joint Communique announced at the 34th ROK-´
U.S. Security Consultative Meeting (SCM)[1)] in December 2002, Ten Military
Missions [2)] previously assumed by the U.S. were handed over to the ROK
military starting from 2004 and completed at the end of 2008.
The number of USFK troops stationed in Korea was gradually scaled-down
from 37,500 in 2003 to 32,500 in 2004 and to 28,500 in 2007. An additional
reduction to 25,000 was expected by 2008, but the two nations agreed to
maintain the troop level at 28,500 at the ROK-U.S. Summit Talks in April
2008. The figure was reconfirmed during the subsequent Defense Ministeriallevel Talks in June 2008 and at the 40th SCM.
Elevation of ROK’s FMS status was pursued actively following the ROKU.S. Summit in April 2008. Consequently, the FMS status of Korea was
elevated to that of NATO+3[3)] (Australia, Japan, New Zealand) in October of 2008.

These constructive adjustments in Alliance issues form the foundation for a
future-oriented relationship that expands cooperation and defines new roles.


2. A Way Ahead for the ROK-U.S. Alliance

The Alliance, once focused primarily on military issues, now seeks to
transform into a more comprehensive and future-oriented relationship by
expanding cooperation.
The two nations have developed a close military collaboration system
based on shared values of liberal democracy, human rights and market
economy. The shared values and trust are utilized to further expand
cooperation into the political, economic, social and cultural sectors. They are
now developing the relationship into a 21st Century strategic alliance that
contributes to regional, global peace and prosperity.
During the Summit in April 2008,
the leaders of the two nations agreed
to upgrade the relationship into a 21st

Section 2 New Alliance Military Structure

Section2. New Alliance Military Structure


The ROK and the U.S. have agreed for the U.S. to transfer wartime OPCON to the

ROK side by April 17, 2012. From there on, the two countries will maintain the new

combined defense system,[4)] equivalent to the existing combined system, that can deter

enemy aggression and ensure sheer victory in the event of war.


1. Chronology of Transferring Wartime Operational
Control (1950-2005)

In July 1950, the President of the Republic of Korea, Syngman Rhee
handed over the Operational Command (OPCOM)[5) ]authorities of the ROK
military to the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command,
General Douglas MacArthur. It was an inevitable choice intended to extricate
the country from crisis during the Korean War. When the war was over, the
ROK and the U.S. agreed to place the ROK Armed Forces under the UN
Commander’s Operational Control (OPCON)[6)] to ensure the UN Forces’
commitment for defending the nation. With the establishment of the ROKU.S. Combined Forces Command (CFC) in November 1978, operational
control was transferred from the UN Commander to the ROK-U.S. CFC
Commander.
Discussions regarding the return of wartime OPCON began in August 1987,
when the then Presidential candidate Roh Tae-woo proclaimed “OPCON
Transition and Relocation of Yongsan Base”as his campaign pledge. The

matter was also discussed in the U.S. through the Nunn-Warner Amendment
to the Brooks Act (1989)[7)] and the East Asia Strategic Initiative (EASI, 19901992),[8)] which added momentum to the issue in ways of a series of working
group studies and close bilateral coordination.
During the 13th session of the ROK-U.S. Military Committee Meeting
(MCM)[9)] in November 1991, the two countries agreed on returning
peacetime OPCON to the ROK government between 1993 and 1995, and to
further discuss wartime OPCON transition after 1996. Thereafter, peacetime
OPCON was transferred to the Chairman of the ROK Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS)
at the end of 1994. Currently, the CFC Commander exercises wartime
OPCON as well as the Combined Delegated Authority (CODA).[10)]


7) Nunn-Warner Amendment
to the Brooks Act
Refers to the addition of the
opinion of U.S. Congress on
the ROK-U.S. relationship to
a bill submitted to U.S.
Congress for approval on
the defense budget and
regulation of troop levels for
FY 1990-1991.

Department of Defense to
Congress in compliance with
the request made by the
Nunn-Warner Amendment. It
was submitted on three
separate occasions in 1990,
1991, and 1992.


2. Timeline of Transferring Wartime Operational
Control (2005-Present)

As the Defense Ministers agreed during
the 37th SCM in October 2005 to
“appropriately accelerate discussions on
wartime OPCON transition,”the discussions
gained momentum.
During the ROK-U.S. Summit in September 2006, the two Presidents agreed in
principle to transfer wartime OPCON.
During the 38th SCM in October, the two
Defense Ministers agreed on the Roadmap signed to implement wartime OPCONStrategic Transition Plan (STP) was

post-OPCON Transition Era. The agreement included a plan to
“decommission the ROK-U.S. CFC and expeditiously complete the transition
of OPCON to the ROK after October 15, 2009 but no later than March 15,
2012.”
In January 2007, the ROK-U.S. Military Committee signed Agreements on

was followed by a February 2007 agreement between the Defense Ministers
to finalize April 17, 2012 as the date for OPCON Transition. Thereafter, CIWG
was formed to establish a Strategic Transition Plan (STP) to transfer OPCON
from CFC to ROK JCS. In June 2007, the plan was signed by the Chairman of
ROK JCS and the Senior U.S. Military Officer Assigned to Korea (SUSMOAK).

The Strategic Transition Plan will provide the combined forces with an
improved operational capability and establish an engine for robust military
coordination system. Further detailed implementation efforts of the STP
include; commissioning a Theater Operation Command System; inaugurating
the ROK-U.S. military coordination system; framing an operation plan;
constructing a combined operations execution system; building a combined
exercise structure; and facilitating the basis for wartime OPCON transition.
Starting in 2008, the ROK and the U.S. have conducted biannual combined
exercises to skillfully master mission areas considered essential under the
new defense system. These exercises are scheduled to continue until the end
of 2011, a year immediately preceding wartime OPCON transition. The
annual SCM and MC will be used as venues to review the progress of STP. In
early 2012, a Combined Evaluation Group consisting of ROK-U.S.
professional experts will be commissioned, in order to assess the status of
OPCON Transition as well as verify the operational capability of the ROK JCS
and U.S. Korea Command (US KORCOM).
OPCON transition signifies a new allied military structure in which the ROK
military assumes the leading role and the U.S. provides overall support,
hence the construct of the “Supported and Supporting Roles.”Korea and the
United States are striving to establish a strong combined defense system
commensurate to the current standing system.

coordination authority. It consists of the Alliance Military Coordination Center
(AMCC), which assists the Chairman of ROK JCS/Theater Operations
Commander, Chairman of U.S. JCS (Senior USFK Officer)/KORCOM
Commander; functional military coordination elements between the ROK JCS
and the U.S. KORCOM; and cooperative bodies between subsidiary
echelons. The two countries will cooperate closely in essential areas[12)]

required to deter war and maintain robust readiness. In terms of the
operation of Air Force assets, the two nations will maintain an efficient
cooperative system that reflects the unique battlefield environment of the
Korean Peninsula.
OPCON transition is initiated by four guiding principles: first, maintaining
the ROK-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty; second, continuing USFK stationing
and guaranteeing rapid deployment of U.S. Forces in times of crisis; third,
providing continuous U.S. support in areas where ROK falls short in
capability, such as in ISR capabilities; fourth, maintaining combined
readiness posture and deterrence capacity during the OPCON transition.
In recognition of the historical meaning and the significance of wartime
OPCON transition, the two nations will monitor changes in the security
environment and transition readiness through annual SCM and MCM,
reflecting adjustments if deemed necessary. Once the transition has been
completed, the ROK and the U.S. will exert all efforts towards early
consolidation of the new combined defense system.

The ROK Ministry of National Defense (MND) is doing its best to provide a stable

stationing environment for USFK and to solidify mutual trust to maintain a robust Alliance.

The two nations are in close consultation to ensure seamless implementation of USFK

relocation plans and appropriate level of defense cost-sharing. By facilitating policy

consultations and various activities to reinforce bilateral ties, the two nations are

promoting mutual trust.

was ratified by the National
Assembly (October 2002).


1. Securing Quality Stationing Conditions for USFK

A. USFK Base Relocation
The ROK and U.S. governments are relocating the U.S. military
installations scattered nationwide including the Yongsan base and the U.S.
2nd Infantry Division in Northern Gyeonggi Province, in order to ensure a
nationally balanced development and provide a stable stationing
environment for U.S. Forces stationed in Korea.
The two nations began negotiations on Yongsan relocation in March 1988
and reached an agreement at the ROK-U.S. Summit in May 2003. In 2004,
the Yongsan Relocation Agreement (UA/IA)[13)] and the Amendment to the
Land Partnership Plan (LPP)[14)] were signed. The plan to relocate the U.S.
2nd Infantry Division, which was initially a separate issue, was integrated
into the LPP. In December 2004, the Special Act on the Assistance to

Pyeongtaek City, etc. for the Relocation of the USFK Bases was enacted to
promote local economic development. In March 2007, the two nations
agreed on the Master Plan and held a groundbreaking ceremony in
November the same year. Presently, the project is being progressively carried
out in accordance with the Master Plan.
In the process of relocation of the U.S. Forces in Korea, a total of 40 U.S.
military bases and facilities were returned to the Korean authorities by the
end of 2008. About 40 more U.S. bases (approximately 43 million square
meters) are scheduled to be returned.


Work under way for a road leading to the newly built U.S. military base in Pyeongtaek
(Camp Humphreys, December 2008)

The consolidation of U.S. military bases is expected to mitigate local
complaints toward the USFK and set conditions favorable to accomplish a
balanced regional development. At the same time, the two nations are
currently discussing ways to resolve environmental cleanup issues
concerning those U.S. bases and facilities being returned.

5 of the Status of Forces
Agreement (SOFA)”[more
widely known as Special
Measures Agreement (SMA)].

92


B. Defense Cost-Sharing[15)]

Since the signing of the Special Measures Agreement (SMA) in 1991, the
ROK government has shouldered a certain portion of the USFK stationing
cost. The size of such payment is proportionately decided by factors
considering the ROK government’s financial capacity as well as efforts to best
improve the USFK stationing environment.


-----

Section 3 Securing Quality Stationing Conditions and Promoting Mutual Trust

Until 2008, the shared defense cost was divided into four areas: labor cost
of the Korean contractors hired by USFK; military construction costs for noncombat military facilities; Combined Defense Improvement Project
(CDIP) for constructing facilities of combat and combat support service; and
logistic areas for service and materiel support. After 2009, CDIP will be
merged as a sub-category of Military Construction. Such integration is
justified by the fact that CDIP, which began in 1974, has satisfied most of its
needs during the past 30 years and that its distinction from military
construction has become increasingly obscure.
MND was in charge of the negotiations for defense cost sharing until 2004,
and subsequently the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MOFAT) took
over in 2005. Defense cost sharing has been paid partly in U.S. Dollars and
in the Korean Won, but since 2005, the entire payment has been processed
in the Korean Won.
In 2007 and 2008, the Korean government paid 725.5 billion and 741.5
billion won respectively, as part of its burden-sharing. The Korean
government’s contribution of payment for 2009-2013 was settled in
December 2008 after several high-level negotiations. The amount for 2009
was set at 760 billion won, which is 2.5 percent more than that of the
previous year. It was agreed that the amount for 2010-2013 should reflect the
rate of inflation of the year before the preceding year, by a margin not
exceeding 4 percent. The recently signed SMA has the following features: (1)
The agreement is made valid for the ensuing five years, enabling stability in
government budget management; (2) The agreement will see a gradual shift
from cash to “in-kind”contribution for Military Construction within three
years.
The appropriate level of defense cost-sharing with the USFK achieves the
following: (1) It fosters a positive stationing environment for USFK soldiers
and contributes to peace on the Peninsula; (2) It helps the local economy by
generating demand for local goods and services; and (3) It facilitates USFK
hiring of Korean civil contractors, which stabilizes the labor market.

Section1.

Defense Reform for “Elite and Advanced Military”


The ROK Ministry of National Defense (MND) is proceeding with defense reform

intended to redesign the military under the concept of an “elite and advanced military,”

corresponding to the 21st century strategic environment and the trends of future warfare.

MND has been carrying out the defense reform focusing on reforming the military

structure to be knowledge-centric and transforming the defense management system to

become a pragmatic and advanced one.

MND is supplementing the Defense Reform Basic Plan periodically by analyzing

domestic/international security environment changes and achievements of the on-going

reform process.

1. Background and Progress of the Defense Reform


In September 2005, MND established the Defense Reform Basic Plan in
order to possess the defense capacity and posture corresponding to the
protean security environment and concept of future warfare.
Taking past experiences into account, MND laid the foundation necessary
to press forward with the reform coherently and consistently. First, MND has
established legal ground by enacting the National Defense Reform Act
(December 2006) and the Enforcement Decree of the National Defense
Reform Act (March 2007). In July 2007, the Office of Defense Reform, an
organization administering the defense reform, was established directly
under the Office of the National Defense Minister, to solidify the basis from
an organizational aspect.


98


-----

Section 1 Defense Reform for Elite and Advanced Military

With such policies and systems in place, MND is continuously pursuing the
reform, and in accordance with the National Defense Reform Act, MND is
reflecting the changes in the security environment coupled with assessments
on progress to supplement the Defense Reform Basic Plan.


2. Overview of Defense Reform

Defense reform consists of two parts; military structure and defense management system.


A. Reforming Military Structure
Military structure reform focuses on achieving an information/knowledge
based qualitative structure in actualizing the central concept of “jointness”in
future warfare. It is divided into command structure, unit structure, personnel
structure, and force structure.
Command structure focuses on developing a system that enables ROK-led
defense planning and operations. The ROK-U.S. military coordination
authority will stabilize the new combined defense system.
Unit structure focuses on simplifying the chain of command while downsizing the number of units. Such reduction will be channeled into combat
units completely organized to enhance overall combat capability.
Personnel structure consists of forming an cadre-based elite military as well
as acquiring advanced force, while gradually down-sizing the troops.
Reserve forces will be improved through revamping the training system,
while prompt mobilization system will further guarantee its combat
capability.
Force structure seeks to actively cope with the existing North Korean threat
as well as various types of threats in the near future. MND will establish an
advanced information/knowledge based force structure and secure the most
effective weaponry and equipment.

Chapter 5 Improvement of Defense Capabilities


B. Reforming Defense Management System
Defense management reform focuses on securing a successful reform of
military structure by transitioning to a management system based on
practicality, cost-efficiency, and high-performance. It focuses on developing
advanced defense personnel management; improving non-combat
management; developing a defense training and education system to build
an elite force; improving quality of life and barracks culture that harmonizes
with the community; implementing advanced defense resource management
system; forming an informatization environment for future warfare; and
improving defense science and technology.
Defense personnel management improves the recruitment system as well
as personnel management in order to promote expertise of the MND service
members including active-duty service members, public officials, and civilian
employees.
Non-combat management consists of adjusting similar and redundant units,
and promoting implementation of civil enterprises management technique
by entrusting responsibilities to the civil sector or operating military executive
agencies. Conserved troops will be utilized to guarantee full complete
organization of combat units.[1)]

Defense training and education focuses on the development of an
information-based scientific training system that fosters defense manpower
best suited for future warfare and technology-intensive military structure.
Barracks culture and welfare focuses on providing ideal conditions for the
service members to concentrate on their tasks. It also includes improving the
medical support system to provide medical care beyond the level of the
civilian medical service.
Defense resource management focuses on improving logistics, military
installations, and environment in order to achieve low-cost, highly-efficient,
and pragmatic defense management. For logistics, the goal is to guarantee
wartime logistics support and to improve peacetime management. For
military installations, emphasis is on efficient unit management and land use.
It also seeks to guarantee harmonization of units with the local community.

The environmental sector will form an eco-friendly image by improving
overall military environmental management.
Defense informatization seeks to establish an environment in which
network centric warfare (NCW) can be waged through sophisticated defense
information system. Efforts will also be made to advance defense information
systems through enterprise architecture (EA); to upgrade information
communication infrastructure; and to improve standardization as well as
interoperability among information systems.
Defense science and technology focuses on improving weapons
development technology in order to independently develop advanced
weapons. It will require increased investment in defense R&D as well as an
improved R&D system.

Section2. Development of Military Structure [2)]


The ROK military seeks to develop a technology-intensive, information/knowledge
based structure that can cope well with changes in future warfare.

The military structure will be divided into command structure, unit structure, and

personnel structure to improve “jointness” and combat capability, and each of the

Services are developing these structures in accordance with the future battle space

environment.

A. Command Structure
Development of command structure seeks to allow ROK-led defense
planning and operations following wartime operational control (OPCON)

An organization of military
forces. It generally refers to
joint composition between
the Army, Navy, and Air

will perform military command duties. The Chairman of ROK JCS will
function as theater operations commander in order to improve command
efficiency. The structure is shown in Figure 5-1.


B. Unit Structure
Development of unit structure focuses on simplifying the chain of
command, while decreasing the number of units in the middle of the chain
to improve the effective performance of the combat mission. The curtailed
troops will be channeled into reinforcing strength of the combat units to
ensure completeness of combat power. Changes in unit structure are shown
in Figure 5-2.

Considering such limitations as changes in the conscription system and the
decreasing birth rate, MND will also pursue policies aimed at increasing the
number of cadres, expanding extended service system, and broadening civil
entrustments as well as military execution agencies.

The Navy will strengthen its triad (surface, underwater, and air) to protect
national interests across the gamut. Such interests not only include coastal
water defense, but also protecting sea line of communications and marine
resources. The Navy will restructure the current three Fleet Commands and
Submarine and Aviation Flotillas into three Fleet Commands, one Submarine
Command, one Aviation Command, and a Maneuver Flotilla. Changes in the

The Navy will secure three-dimensional combat assets including
Gwanggaeto Ⅲ-class destroyers (Aegis), next frigate, Jangbogo Ⅲ-class
submarines, assault helicopters, and minesweeping helicopters.[4)] Such
capacity will enable the Navy to effectively accrue operational capability
around the coastal waters surrounding the Korean Peninsula.
The Marine Corps’main mission is amphibious operations. The Marine
Corps will develop into an air land maneuver unit structure suitable for rapid
response duties on land and island operations.

C. Air Force
The Air Force will evolve to best perform precision strikes and achieve air
superiority. To that end, the capacity to monitor for indicators of enemies
and conduct retaliatory attacks will assure operational coverage to include
the entire Korean Peninsula.
The Air Force will activate Northern Air Combat Command under control
of Air Force Operations Command. Units will consist of two Combat
Commands, nine Fighter Wings, Air Defense Artillery Command, Tactical Air
Control Unit, and Air Defense and Control Wing. In the long term, the Air
Force will secure a space force system to gradually develop a space
operations execution unit. Changes in the Air Force unit structure are shown

Section3.

Force Structure in Preparation for Future Warfare


MND will construct an elite military capable of deterring war and ensuring victory in

every battle to prepare for the North’s military threat and a variety of future threats.

For that reason, MND is acquiring an early-warning and real-time surveillance

capability as well as a system for network centric warfare (NCW), and investing in the

qualitative improvement of mobility and precision-strike capabilities.

1. Trajectory of Developments in the Force Structure


MND is developing its force structure with the objective of acquiring
sufficient capability to actively respond to national security threats that
include North Korea and possible future threats. This will require
establishing an advanced system based on information/knowledge and
acquiring combat-efficient weapons and equipments. The trajectory of
developments in force structure will be as follows:
First, improve early warning and surveillance/reconnaissance capabilities
in the vicinities of the Korean Peninsula.
Second, establish a command, control, communication, computer &
intelligence (C4I) system that allows for integrated combat capability and a
reliable and integrated battlefield network with improved survivability in
preparation for NCW.
Third, enhance long-range precision strike capability and multidimensional high-speed maneuverability in ground, sea, and air, and


108


-----

Section 3 Force Structure in Preparation for Future Warfare

reinforce defense capabilities to ensure survivability.
Science and technology are developing rapidly and advanced weapon
systems are becoming costly, high-tech, and complex. In order to respond to
such changes in the environment, MND is striving to develop a user-centric
acquisition system that improves the acquisition cycle of weapon systems
(i.e. requirement-acquisition-maintenance).


2. Securing Advanced Combat Capabilities

A. Force Improvement Programs for FY2008
The defense budget for FY2008 stood at 26,649 billion won, an increase of
8.8 percent from that of the preceding year. The expenditures for force
improvement reached 7,681.3 billion won, a 15 percent annual increase. A
total of 170 ongoing programs were carried out in 2008, with a budget of
7,610.8 billion won. Thirty new programs were launched in 2008 with a 70.5
billion won budget. Major ongoing and new programs are shown in Table 5-1.

promotes programs to acquire AWACS, tactical surveillance and
reconnaissance system, and to develop medium-altitude unmanned aerial
vehicle in order to facilitate strategic level surveillance and early-warning.
The C4I system seeks to establish a foundation for NCW by guaranteeing
jointness and seamless flow of information. In order to achieve such
objectives, MND seeks to improve an interconnecting capability between
Korea Joint Command and Control System (KJCCS), which connects ROK
JCS to operations commands of each Service, and tactical C4I systems for
each Service. It also seeks to field rear area C4I systems. Military Information
Management System (MIMS), which can comprehensively process each unit’s
military information of three Services, will be fielded in connection with
KJCCS. Furthermore, Joint Tactical Data Link System (JTDLS) will be
developed to promote exchange of digitalized tactical information. Tactical
Information Communication Network (TICN) which allows real-time
broadband communication will be developed as well.
In order to secure long-range precision strike capability, MND pursues
programs to acquire advanced forces as follows: K-9 self-propelled artillery,
large-caliber MLRS (munitions), Gwanggaeto Ⅲ-class destroyers (Aegis),
Jangbogo Ⅱ-class (1,800t-class) submarines, ship-to-ship guided missiles,
joint air-to-surface stand-off missiles (JASSM), F-15K fighters (2nd round
purchase), and aerial refuel aircraft.
Continued efforts will be made to improve outdated weapons and

Section4.

Fostering the Reserve Forces as Key Combat Units


Modern warfare is conducted as a total war with all available national resources, which

makes efficient employment of reserve forces one of the key elements for victory.

MND is upgrading the reserve forces in relation to its buildup of regular forces. To this

end, the Ministry is enhancing organization and management system of reserve forces,

while improving its education and training infrastructure.

1. Organization and Management of Reserve Forces


A. Organization and Resources Management
The reserve forces conducts its homeland defense mission according to the
designated reserve units’area of responsibility. The reserve also conducts its
combat mission as replacement for combat loss or for activation and
augmentation of units in wartime.
In accordance with the Military Personnel Act, reserve officers, warrant
officers, and non-commissioned officers (NCOs) are expected to serve as
Homeland Reserve Forces (HRF) until retirement age for active-duty

members. Those who have completed mandatory military service are
expected to serve as HRF for eight years. Anyone aged 18 or more may
volunteer to serve as a member of the HRF. Presently, there are about 10,000
volunteers including women operating under the HRF.
HRF currently consists of about three million troops, serving either as
members of local reserve units (by eup, myeon, dong) or workplace reserve
units. The status is shown in Table 5-2.


Table 5-2. Status of the Homeland Reserve Forces


|Col1|Col2|Col3|(Unit: thousand persons)|Col5|Col6|

|Total|Those who have served as HRF troops for less than 5 years|Those who have served for 5 years or more|Total|Local reserve forces|Workplace reserve forces|
|3,040|1,490|1,550|3,040|2,330|710|


Until 2020, MND plans to refurbish organizations of the reserve and reduce
the period of service to utilize only the effective resources. Specifically, it is
planning to modify the reserve forces by taking into consideration
administrative area integration, the discrepancies in resources of urban and
rural areas, and changes in the operational environment.


B. Managing HRF Commanders
Every year, qualified reserve
officers are selected to perform as
HRF commanders.
HRF commanders’duties include
defending responsible areas, commanding HRF troops, and managing
reserve resources. They are also Local reserve troops visiting local elderly
expected to lead efforts to assist
disaster relief and to support local communities. Current status of HRF
commanders above company-level echelon is shown in Table 5-3.

2. Reserve Force Training and Education


A. Outline of the Training
The purpose of reserve force training is to maintain a level of readiness for
wartime mobilization and to foster homeland defense capability. The Military
Service Act and the Establishment of Homeland Reserve Forces Act classify
individuals into reservists as well as those professionally related to HRF as
participants of reserve force training. The training sessions can be divided
into mobilization reserve forces[9)] training, homland defense reserve forces[10)]

training, and officer training.
The length of training is stipulated in the aforementioned Acts. Details on
training sessions are shown in Table 5-4.


9) Mobilization Reserve
Forces
Those who have served in
the reserve forces for up to
four years. In wartime, they
will fill openings in activeduty units.

10) Homeland Defense
Reserve Forces
Those who have served in
the reserve forces for five
years or more. Duties include homeland defense.

B. Improving HRF Training and Conditions
MND has made efforts to enhance
overall convenience for reservists and
improve the conditions and quality of HRF
training.
A new method of training was adopted
in 2007 to allow reservists to voluntarily
participate in training sessions. In the past,
mobilization training was managed in a
unilateral way under the directive of an
active-duty personnel. The new system
enables reservists to take a more active HRF training using survival game

equipment

role that reflects their respective tasks.
Also, survival game equipment familiar to the younger generations was
adopted in training in order to provide a more realistic simulation of warfare.
As of late 2008, a total of 15,477 sets of survival game equipment are being
used in 215 reserve force training camps. Moreover, the improvements in
training camps have facilitated a more realistic experience comparable to
actual warfare, satisfying practical training needs for the participants’
individual tasks.
In the past, there have been complaints that the training often interfered
with the participants’occupational duties. To ameliorate such inconvenience,
participants were allowed to choose training dates and camps via internet
since 2005. In 2006, the policy of designating holidays for training was
adopted for those that faced limitations in attending training during the
workweek.
MND has made efforts to improve food, transportation, and facilities at
training camps. Now, sanitation verification has been strengthened against
local companies providing reservists’meals, while further efforts are being
made to improve the general quality of food. Public transportation as well as
chartered buses now serves the routes to training camps and training center
information is provided by automobile GPS to help reservists with


118


-----

Section 4 Fostering the Reserve Forces as Key Combat Units

navigation. Efforts are continuously made to improve facilities such as
restrooms and cafeterias.


C. Future Development of Reserve Training
The reserve force training strives to develop along the lines of pursuing a
results-oriented training while promoting citizens’convenience, as well as
fostering a sense of achievement and satisfaction from the reservists through
self-participatory training. To achieve such objectives, some training will be
replaced by internet-sessions. Training camps will be integrated regionally,
and will be developed into a professional, scientific, and citizen-friendly
facility.

3. Establishing and Managing Defense Mobilization
Information System


In June 2006, MND completed phase 1 of the Defense Mobilization
Information System project to automate and computerize all mobilization
processes. The effort laid the groundwork for a systematic mobilization of
HRF troops based on data sharing among related agencies.
The system also brought about savings in budget and manpower. The use
of electronic mail when sending reservist tasking orders helped save about
370 million won a year. Automated duties helped reduce the number of fulltime reservists who assist HRF commanders by 10,600 between 2006 and
2007. Furthermore, an internet-based system, which allows individuals to
choose their training dates and to voice their opinions, has gone a long way
towards fostering civilian convenience.
Phase 2 of the project, concerning automated personnel mobilization and
provision of integrated mobilization command information, is now under
way. Phase 3, concerning materiel mobilization, is scheduled to be
completed by 2012.

Section5. Strengthening Defense Diplomacy


Founded on the ROK-U.S. Alliance, MND is strengthening cooperative military ties with

Japan, China, and Russia to lay the groundwork for peace and stability. Also, MND is

extending its military diplomacy from the Northeast Asian region to the global level,

including Southeast Asia and the Middle East, and actively participating in multilateral

security talks and international cooperative organizations. Through such efforts, the ROK

military will perform a role befitting Korea’s position in the global community.

1. Defense Exchanges and Cooperation with Neighboring Countries


A. Exchange and Cooperation with Japan
As allies of the United States, the Republic of
Korea and Japan share the basic values of
liberal democracy and market economy. The
two nations cooperate through bilateral and SixParty Talks, the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF),
and the Asia Security Summit, to resolve the
North Korean nuclear issue and establish
regional peace and stability.
The defense authorities of the two countries ROK-Japan joint search & rescue

Section 5 Strengthening Defense Diplomacy

Minister. In addition, MND has held multi-layered working-level meetings
such as Defense Policy Talks (at the director-general level), Security Policy
Consultation (at the director-general level of defense/foreign affairs
ministries), and Defense Exchange Cooperation Working-level Meetings (at
director level) with their Japanese counterparts. Through such channels, the
two nations are enhancing mutual understanding and expanding the scope
of cooperation to achieve peace and stability on the Peninsula as well as in
Northeast Asia.
The exchange between the two countries consists not only of meetings
between high-ranking officials such as those between the Chairmen of JCS
and Service Chiefs, but also of regular working-level and intelligence
exchange meetings. In addition, exchange among units, mutual visits to
colleges of each Service and academies, exchange of students for oversea
studies and other personnel exchanges are actively taking place. Current
interactions include humanitarian search and rescue exercises, exchange of
visits between transportation aircraft, and mutual cooperation in international
peacekeeping operations, etc.
However, the difference in historical perspectives and Japan’s unjust claim
to sovereignty over Dokdo, which is an inherent territory of the ROK, have
been singled out as factors that should be settled in order to achieve
satisfactory development in future military exchange and cooperation.
MND will continue to solidify military ties and mutual trust with Japan, and
will strive to develop the relationship into a “future-oriented and mature
partnership,”as agreed upon at the ROK-Japan Summit of April 2008.

B. Exchange and Cooperation with China
The relationship between the Republic of Korea and the People’s Republic
of China[11)] has made rapid progress in diverse sectors, including growth in
volume of trade and the exchange of personnel. The scope of defense
exchange and cooperation has also been expanded.
The year 2007 was designated as the Year of Korea-China Exchanges,
commemorating the 15th anniversary of Korea-China normalization of


-----

relations. Exchanges and cooperation between the two defense authorities
were thus invigorated. ROK Defense Minister, the Chairman of JCS and the
Chief of Naval Operations visited China, and the Chief and Deputy Chief of
Staff of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) paid a visit to Korea. Workinglevel exchanges included Defense Policy Talks, an exchange between the
3rd ROK Army (TROKA) and the PLA Jinan Command, as well as a defense
academic conference. For the first time, the two countries carried out a
search and rescue exercise during the ROK Fleet’s visit to China. In addition,
exchanges between military athletes, military research institutions, and
colleges of each Service were active as well.
In 2008, the Chief of Staff of the
ROK Army and Air Force visited
China, and PLA’s Chief of Naval
Operations visited Korea for the
first time. In May 2008, the ROK
military sent 26.6 tons of relief
supplies to earthquake victims in
Sichuan Province, China, using Relief supplies from ROK for earthquake victims in
three Air Force cargo planes. China (China, May 30, 2008).
MND will continue to facilitate defense exchanges with China and explore
new areas of mutual cooperation.


C. Exchange and Cooperation with Russia
The bilateral relationship between the ROK and Russia has continued to
develop since the normalization of diplomatic relations in 1990. At the ROKRussia Summit held in September 2008, the Presidents of the two countries
upgraded the bilateral relationship from a“mutually trustful and
comprehensive partnership”to a“strategic cooperative partnership.”The two
countries are reinforcing the level of bilateral cooperation in various sectors,
including politics, economy, energy, space technology, etc.
The defense authorities of the two countries have signed a memorandum of
understanding (MOU) concerning military exchanges for the next two years and


122

institutions are as follows: Defense Policy Talks between the defense
ministries; a meeting of the Joint Military Committee between ROK JCS and
the Russian Military General Staff; conference between the Armies of the two
countries; the consultative meeting for execution of the Agreement on
Prevention of Sea Incidents; the Inter-Air Force Meeting; and sessions
between military history institutes. In particular, a cruise fleet of the Russian
Pacific Fleet called at Busan Port to take part in goodwill activities and a
combined search and rescue exercise (SAREX) in September 2007.
In April 2008, the 3rd session of the ROK-Russia Joint Commission on
Cooperation in Military Technical Field, Defense Industries and Countries

(1) Southwest Asia
MND is enhancing military exchange and cooperation with Southwest
Asian countries, with a focus on India and Pakistan, including reciprocal
visits between students at the NDU and Cruise Training Fleets as well as the
dispatch of military officers for entrustment education.
Recently, India has been emerging as a country that can exercise significant
influence in world affairs with its rapid economic growth. In 2006, the ROK
started negotiations over the possibility of signing the Comprehensive
Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with India. MND has also been
seeking to enhance military ties with India, holding Defense Ministerial Talks
in New Delhi in May 2007.
As for the relationship with Pakistan, the volume of bilateral trade has been
gradually increasing, and the ROK government is contributing to Pakistan’s
economic development by providing development aid. The ROK Armed
Forces is laying the foundations for defense cooperation and exchanges
between the two countries through reciprocal visits between students of the
NDU and exchange educational sessions for the student officers of the
Command and General Staffs College.
While strengthening exchange and cooperation with India and Pakistan in
the future, MND plans to gradually expand such defense exchange and
cooperation to other countries in Southwest Asia.

with Korean officers and cadets being sent to various military educational
institutions in European states including the United Kingdom, Germany, and
Turkey, as well as receiving officers from Turkey, France, etc. at the military
educational institutions in Korea.
MND plans to extend the opportunities for mutual exchange and
cooperation to those under the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS)[14)] as well as various East European countries. MND will also continue
to invite veterans who have participated in the Korean War and their families
to pay visits to Korea and to provide support for building war memorial
monuments in order to strengthen the ties with the participants of the Korean
War under the UN flag.

D. Other Regions
In November 2007, the ROK government held the 1st session of the ROKCentral Asia Cooperation Forum[15)] in Seoul, with the Vice Foreign Ministers
as the Chief Delegates of five Central Asian countries.[16)] It was part of the
effort to expand the cooperative relationship with the countries of Central
Asia beyond the current focus on the energy and resource sectors to include
various sectors such as information / communication, construction, culture,
education, and tourism. MND is also reinforcing its exchanges and
cooperation with the Central Asian countries. In November 2007, the ROK

expanding defense exchanges and cooperation with those countries.
Subsequently, the ROK Vice Defense Minister paid a visit to Brazil and
Columbia in June 2008 and laid the groundwork for mutual cooperation in
areas such as the defense industry.
However, the ROK has yet to engage in active defense exchanges and
cooperation with African countries. MND is actively promoting its defense
policy to high-level military personnel and students visiting Korea in an effort
to look for opportunities for exchanges and cooperation with African
countries. MND communicated its defense
policy to students of the Nigeria National
Defense University who visited Korea in
April 2007, and in late June of 2008, the
ROK Defense Minister discussed ways to
enhance defense exchanges and cooperation with the Ghana Defense Minister

In addition, global initiatives to strengthen controls over conventional
weapons have also been maintained and expanded. Most notably,
discussions are under way to prevent the illegal circulation of small arms &
light weapons and to regulate the use of cluster munitions.
The Republic of Korea has used its renewed national strength since
membership into the United Nations in 1991, to actively participate in the
international community’s disarmament and non-proliferation regimes. The
participation status is shown in Table 5-6.
In particular, the ROK is also taking part in the international community’s

International Peacekeeping Operations


Peacekeeping operations (PKO) have been actively deployed as part of the

international community’s efforts to secure world peace and stability. Recently, PKOs

have been extending its efforts from monitoring areas of conflict to direct involvement in

the settlement of conflicts and post-reconstruction. MND is actively participating in UN

PKO and those of the multi-national forces (MNF) and laying the groundwork to expand

such efforts.

International peacekeeping activity can be divided into UN peacekeeping
operations and those of the multi-national forces. Table 5-7 compares the two.

1. ROK Armed Forces’Participation in the UN PKO

The UN-led peacekeeping activity first began with the United Nations
Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) of Palestinian region in 1948. Over
the past 60 years, a total of one million troops from 120 countries have taken
part in UN PKO in 60 areas.
The ROK Armed Forces began participating in PKO in 1993, when an
engineering battalion was dispatched to the UN Operation in Somalia II
(UNOSOM-Ⅱ). The military units dispatched by the ROK military as part of
UN PKO in the subsequent period include a medical support group to West
Sahara, military observers to India/Pakistan and the Georgia (1994), an
engineering battalion to Angola (1995), and an infantry unit to East Timor for
the first time (1999). Presently, as part of UN PKO efforts, the ROK military
has dispatched forces to Lebanon and military observers in six areas,
including India/Pakistan and Georgia. See Figure 5-8 for their current status.

Since August 2007, the Dongmyeong Unit has been engaged in civilmilitary operations called Operation Peace Wave, [24)] a program designed to
attend to local issues for the Lebanese that have been suspended for a long
time, and the unit was praised as being “a family, a brother”to the Lebanese
people. As a result, the ROK troops were awarded the UN Medal in
December 2007 and in August 2008 by the UNIFIL Commander as the
exemplary unit involved in peacekeeping operations.
In early August 2008, the second and third units rotated, leaving the
number of stationed soldiers at 359.

duties as military observers, nine as members of the United Nations Military
Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP), and seven as members
of the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG). In addition,
30 officers or so are currently serving in areas of conflict, including Sudan
and Liberia, where they monitor cease-fire violations and take part in patrols,
investigations/reports, and mediation efforts under the local command.
Five ROK officers had been dispatched in March 2007 to the United
Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) at the request of the UN and authority of
UN Security Council Resolution 1740, and returned home in July 2008 after
having completed a tour that involved monitoring cease-fire violations and
providing support for local elections.

The role of the MNF PKO is to expand with international terrorism
emerging as a serious threat to global security.
Korea has joined the international effort against terrorism in the name of
world peace and the safety of humankind. It also dispatched troops to take
part in the efforts to secure peace and stability in Afghanistan and Iraq with
the approval of the National Assembly.
The Dongeui and Dasan Units in Afghanistan and the Zaytun Division in
Iraq returned home after finishing their duties in December 2007 and
December 2008, respectively. Presently, staff and liaison officers are
stationed in four countries, including Bahrain and Djibouti. See Figure 5-9 for
details.

The Medical Support Group (Dongeui Unit) (780 troops in total) provided
medical services to a total of 230,000 residents and members of the allied
forces. The unit was highly acclaimed by the locals for its humanitarian
service and health education sessions.
The Construction Engineering Support Group (Dasan Unit) (1,332 troops
in total) successfully implemented various tasks such as building hospitals
and bridges for the reconstruction of postwar Afghanistan, supporting local
rehabilitation groups, and offering civilian support.
Meanwhile, even after the withdrawal of Dongeui and Dasan Units, some
military medical staff have joined a civilian-led medical service and
vocational training team.


B. Dispatch of ROK Troops to Iraq
In April 2003, the ROK dispatched the Seohee Unit (200 troops), a
construction engineering support group, and the Jema Unit (90 troops), a
medical support group, to Nassiriya, Iraq, as part of the Multinational ForcesIraq (MNF-I).
For a year or so until August 2004, the Seohee and Jema Units carried out
activities such as supporting MNF base operations and humanitarian recovery
while providing medical services to the locals as well. Such efforts helped
establish peace and contributed to reconstruction efforts in Iraq and paved
the way for the Peace and Reconstruction Division (the Zaytun Division).

and to support peace and recovery projects.
At the 245th special session of the National Assembly in February 2004, the
Assembly approved the Government’s plan to dispatch additional troops to
Iraq. Subsequently, MND selected Arbil, Iraq, as the area for dispatch and in
July 2004, the first unit of 3,566 soldiers completed their deployment in Iraq.
Thereafter, a total of eight shift units took their turns and a total of 18,700
were dispatched to the area to conduct its mission.
The dispatch of the Zaytun Division was submitted and approved by the
National Assembly on four occasions. The number of troops involved
decreased every year in consideration of the local situation in Iraq: to 2,200
in 2005; 1,200 in 2006; and 650 in 2007. The Zaytun withdrew in December
2008 after successful completion of its mission.

(2) Achievements of the Zaytun Division
The Zaytun Division has achieved great success in Iraq in ways such as
supporting peace settlement and reconstruction efforts, and consolidating the
alliance with the U.S.
Activities carried out by the Zaytun
Division include: providing humanitarian
support and building friendly relationships
with the locals; supporting maintenance of
public security; establishing the basis for
social and economic development; and

Chapter 5 Improvement of Defense Capabilities


First of all, humanitarian support and friendly relationship building
activities provide construction materials for building or renovating housings
of the locals. The Zaytun Division helped the locals to lead construction
efforts, imbuing a sense of improved standard of living on the locals. Also,
the Zaytun Division operated hospitals which treated over 100 patients per
day, so that a variety of medical services could be provided to those who
had not received benefits. Zaytun also conducted multi-functional civilmilitary operations (Operation Green Angel)[26)] which took care of local
people’s unsolved issues such as installing public waterworks. This in turn,
earned the Zaytun Division respect from the local people, creating a
mutually friendly relationship. Zaytun conducted other supporting activities
or friendly activities such as opening schools for illiterates, donating
medicines, operating a Taekwondo class, and inviting key officials from the
regional government to Korea, as well as periodical exchange of people.
In terms of the supporting activity in public security, the division helped
the local police to reinforce its ability by supplying equipment and materiel.
In addition, building and repairing police facilities such as check points in
outer blocks of airports improved local conditions to maintain order.
Providing support for socio-economic development and education for the
local people inspired locals in backwater areas to gain a sense of selfsustenance, and laid the foundation to improve their standard of living.
Notably, through Saemaeul Movement Projects, the Unit introduced the
Korean experience during its modernization process and inspired the locals’
willingness for self-sustenance. The project achieved the following:
distribution of Saemaeul Movement-related books; operation of the

Saemaeul Center; improvement of surroundings such as a new construction
of community centers and renovation of the public park; and establishment
of sisterhood relationships at the village-level and promotion of self-support
activities.
Many local residents attended the Zaytun Skills Training Center and more
than 80% of them have landed jobs.
Despite difficult conditions, the members of the Zaytun Division
successfully completed assigned missions with a clear sense of duty and
impressive self-esteem in representing the Republic of Korea. The division’s
humanitarian assistance is reputed to be the most exemplary of all allies,
gaining the reputation of having presented an “ideal model for civil affairs
operation.”
Foreign troop dispatch and befitting missions comparable to Korea’s
national power, is significant, in that it not only contributes to world peace
and stability, but also enhances national prestige for the Republic of Korea.

Activities


The Republic of Korea is one of the greatest beneficiaries from UN for its
assistance during the Korean War to overcome such national crisis. Active
PKO participation symbolizes Korea returning the favor to the international
community, as well as securing international support when such a need

rises. The participation is in line with the government’s pledge to become a
Global Korea, and helps improve the ROK military’s civil-military operations
capability.
Thus, MND is making an effort to establish a legal and systemic basis in
order to expand Korean participation in PKO and also enhance military
capabilities.
Efforts made in this context are the following: first, in coordination with the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MOFAT), there are now plans to enact
the PKO Participation Act (provisional name) to simplify the domestic
procedure to dispatch troops; second, MND is reviewing the formation and
size of standing forces for PKO missions for timely response upon request
from the global society to join peacekeeping efforts and to ensure successful
mission accomplishment; third, the function of the Military PKO Center is
being strengthened in order to improve PKO training, cultivate instructors,
and develop doctrines; finally, exchange and cooperative opportunities with
foreign countries such as PKO-related multilateral exercises and conferences
are being expanded.

Section1.

Confidence Building and Arms Control


With the aim of facilitating a durable peace on the Korean Peninsula, the ROK

government is advancing inter-Korean relations under the rubric of mutual benefits and

common prosperity, while devising methods to build confidence and relieve military

tensions. Against this background, the ROK Ministry of National Defense (MND) seeks to

reach and implement agreements aimed at lowering tension and building confidence

such as military assurance on exchange and cooperation as well as prevention of armed

conflicts through the South-North military talks. In addition, through inter-Korean arms

control measures, MND seeks to maintain military stability on the Korean Peninsula and

continue its efforts to offer military support for the creation of a new peace structure.[1)]


1. Military Confidence Building Measures through
the South-North Military Talks

A. A Need for Military Confidence Building Measures[2)]

Despite the progress made in inter-Korean exchange and cooperation
since the First South-North Summit Talks in 2000, a possibility for accidental
skirmish amid armed confrontation still exists.
Massive military forces of South and North Korea are standing off against
each other along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), and actual armed conflicts
occurred between the two navies in the West Sea, both in 1999 and 2002.
Therefore, resolving distrust and establishing military confidence is a
prerequisite for establishing peace on the Korean Peninsula.

Section 1 Confidence Building and Arms Control


Through the South-North military talks, MND seeks to adopt and
implement agreements aimed at relieving tension and building confidence.

B. The South-North Military Talks Progress
In the early 1990s, the two Koreas held High-level Talks[3)] and Military
Subcommittee Sessions.[4)] Major agreements adopted by military talks were as
follows: Agreement on Reconciliation, Non-aggression, Cooperation and
Exchange (Inter-Korean Basic Agreement); Joint Declaration on the
Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula (Joint Declaration of
Denuclearization); Subsequent Agreement on Non-aggression to the InterKorean Basic Agreement; and Agreement on the Composition and Operation
of the Joint Military Commission.[5)]

The Inter-Korean Basic Agreement and Subsequent Agreement on Nonaggression clauses contain agreements on military confidence building
measures that include: exchange of military personnel and information;
notification of military exercises; and installation of a hotline between the
North and South military authorities. However, such agreements have failed
to be implemented due to the North’s passive attitudes on the issues.
The military talks were suspended in 1993 amid suspicions toward the
North’s nuclear program and were resumed following the First South-North
Summit Talks in 2000.
Since 2000, South-North military talks were held a total of 46 times with
Defense Ministerial Talks being the apex of the series of talks: General
Officer-level Talks were held in order to relieve tension and build
confidence; and Military Working-level Talks were held to ensure military
assurance on exchange and cooperative projects. Table 6-1 shows the status
of the South-North military talks.


3) South-North High-level
Talks
∙The two sides held the
first Prime Ministerial-level
Talks on September 4,
1990 at the suggestion of
the South on December
28, 1988. Thereafter, a
total of eight high-level
sessions were held until
September 18, 1992.
∙At South-North High-level
Talks, Inter-Korean Basic
Agreement, the Joint
Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula, and the Agreement on the Composition
and Operation of Subcommittees were signed.
∙Subcommittee sessions of
the bilateral High-level
Talks consist of Political
Subcommittee, Military
Subcommittee and Exchange / Cooperation
Subcommittee.

4) Military Subcommittee
∙As a committee to implement the non-aggression
clause of the Basic Agreement, eight plenary sessions were held during the
period of March 13September 5, 1992, Chairmen of the two sides met
three times, and the committee members met three
times.
∙At the plenary sessions,
the Agreement on Composition and Operation of
the Joint Military Commission and the Subsequent
Agreement on Nonaggression for the InterKorean Basic Agreement
were signed.

(1) Defense Ministerial Talks
The Defense Ministerial Talks were held twice. The first session was held
in Jeju Island in September 2000. The two Koreas adopted a joint press
release consisting of five items that included a joint effort to alleviate military
tension and to hold a working-level meeting to support inter-Korean
railroad/road projects.
After an interval of seven years, the second meeting took place in
Pyongyang in November 2007. The two sides discussed measures on
conducting joint efforts to relieve military tension and assure peace,
preventing military clashes in the West Sea, undergoing joint excavation of
war remains, and providing for military assurance on exchange and
cooperation projects. The parties also adopted an agreement containing
seven articles and 21 clauses. The agreements signed at the Defense
Ministerial Talks are shown in Table 6-2.


5) Joint Military Commission
∙The purpose of the
commission is to execute
the non-aggression clause
and discuss matters for
establishment of military
trust and realization of
arms reduction.
∙It was agreed to have a
Chairman (vice-minister
level or above), Vice Chairman and five members.
The commission’s functions are: (1) to have
discussions about the implementation and compliance of the non-aggression
clause; (2) to draft relevant
agreements; and (3) to
implement, confirm, and
supervise agreements to
alleviate military confrontation.
∙Sessions of the commission have not been held
as of December 2008 due
to the North’s incompliance.

(2) General Officer-level Talks
Inter-Korean General Officer-level Talks (head delegate: Major General
level) had been held seven times between May 2004 and December 2007.


-----

Section 1 Confidence Building and Arms Control

Issues discussed, were relieving military tension, preventing collisions in the
West Sea coupled with launching joint fishery, and military assurance of
inter-Korean economic cooperation. During the 2nd meeting in June 2004,
the two sides signed an Agreement on the Prevention of Accidental Naval
Clashes in the West Sea, and the Cessation of Propaganda Activities and the
Elimination of Propaganda Apparatus from the DMZ (The June 4th
Agreement). The two sides eliminated all propaganda activities and
apparatus in accordance with the agreement. However, measures to prevent
collisions in the West Sea such as exchanging signals on the Global Maritime
Distress Safety System and sharing information on illegal fishing activities by
third nations have not been completely realized, due to the North’s passivity
on the issue.
During the 5th meeting in May 2007, a Provisional Agreement was signed
for militarily assurance of the railroad test-runs along Eastern and Western
Transportation Corridors (ETC and WTC). During the 7th meeting in
December 2007, the two sides discussed military assurance of transit,
communication, and customs process in the Joint Administrative Area (JAA).
They agreed on assuring free transit, allowing the use of the Internet and
wired/wireless communications, and simplifying the customs process.
Agreements signed at the General Officer-level Talks are shown in Table 6-3.

(3) Military Working-level Talks
Inter-Korean Military Working-level Talks (head delegate: Colonel level)
had taken place a total of 37 times between November 2000 and October
2008. Meetings until 2003 mainly dealt with providing military support to
inter-Korean transit and railroad/road projects. Meetings thereafter focused
on implementing agreements made at the Defense Ministerial and General
Officer-level Talks.
During the 8th meeting in September
2002, an Agreement on Military Assurances for Designation of the Joint
Administrative Area in the East and
West Coast Districts and the Construction of Railways and Roads Connecting
the South and North was adopted. In

The 37th Military Working-level Taiks

accordance with this agreement, parts (Panmunjeom, October 2008)
of the DMZ along the Eastern and
Western Transportation Corridors were placed under the JAA. June 2003
marked the first ever instance when the two military authorities inspected
each other’s mine sweeping efforts in such areas. During the 35th meeting in
December 2007, a Military Assurance Agreement on Railway Freight
Transport between Munsan and Bongdong was signed. The cargo trains had
run 222 times between December 11, 2007 and November 28, 2008, until the
North unilaterally announced its cessation on December 1, 2008. The
agreements from Military Working-level Talks are shown in Table 6-4.
The two Koreas have signed a total of 12 agreements as a result of the
military talks since 2000. Among them, the June 4th Agreement and the
Subsequent Agreement to the June 4th Agreement are the only ones dealing
with actual confidence building. This is due to the North’s reticence
regarding purely military matters such as mutual confidence-building in
contrast to the active attitude exhibited in providing military assurances to
exchange and cooperation issues.

2. Military Assurance for Inter-Korean Exchange
and Cooperation

A. The Need for Military Assurance
Since the 2000 Summit Talks, inter-Korean exchange and cooperation have
expanded to include the ETC/WTC and Road Projects, the Gaeseong
Industrial Complex, and the Gaeseong and Mt. Geumgang Tours. Between
1989 till the first half of 2008, 530,000 Koreans had crossed the South-North
border with a total trade volume of $10.07 billion.
The government seeks to improve the quality of the relationship through
exchanges and cooperation based on mutual benefits and common
prosperity. In order to promote such projects, military assurance measures
between the ROK military and the United Nations Command (UNC), or the
North Korean Military should be premised. This is due to the fact that most


151


-----

Chapter 6 Military Support for Peace on the Korean Peninsula

of the projects are carried out along areas under military jurisdiction via the
Military Demarcation Line (MDL), DMZ, and the Northern Limit Line (NLL).


B. Proceedings

(1) Road and Railroad Projects in ETC and WTC
With the coordination and consent of the UNC and the North Korean
military authorities, the ROK established a JAA in the DMZ where railway
and road connection projects and transit for passengers would take place.
Mine sweeping as well as construction support took place in the JAA and
Civilian Control Line (CCL) areas during the period of September 2000 to
December 2003. In addition, authorization procedures to allow access for
South-North Koreans to cross the MDL as well as safety assurance measures
were devised to assure transit and safety of personnel.
Through such military assurance, the ROK military laid the groundwork to
expand Inter-Korean cooperative projects such as the Gaeseong Industrial
Complex and the Gaeseong and Mt. Geumgang Tours.


(2) Inter-Korean Passage
The ROK military is maintaining military assurance measures and military
readiness posture for contingencies to ensure safety of transit between the
North and the South in land, air, and sea routes. The number of inter-Korean
cross-border passages since 2003 is shown in Table 6-5.

to the Agreement on Non-aggression. The Basic Agreement, however, has
made little progress due to the North’s passive attitudes on the issue.
Notwithstanding this dire situation, MND continues to ready itself to
implement arms control. It is exploring ways to achieve the desired goal, for
example, by undergoing multilateral research and discussions on
disarmament such as hosting arms control seminars and publishing issues of
the Korean Peninsula Arms Control. Also, to enhance its capabilities in arms
control verification, MND is holding workshops on improving inspection job
performance, conducting simulated inspection training and nuclear
inspection training, sending officials to attend verification education and
training courses, etc.


4. The Way Ahead

Although the military talks are assessed to have played some role in
supporting cooperation programs and thus alleviating tension, measures to
build military confidence have remained extremely rudimentary.
For consolidating peace on the Korean Peninsula, the two Koreas must
abide by the following agreements: notification of military exercises; military
personnel exchange; military information exchange; peaceful use of the
DMZ; and installation of a South-North military hotline.
Through the military talks, MND will continue to exert efforts to reduce
tension and build confidence in accordance with the basic tenets of the
Government’s North Korea policy of mutual benefits and common
prosperity, which aims to resolve all inter-Korean issues through dialogue.
In accordance with the principle of “resolving easier issues first,”the talks
will first discuss military support on inter-Korean cooperative projects.
Meanwhile, the military will progressively discuss confidence building and
arms control within the frameworks of the Basic Agreement and the
Subsequent Agreement on Non-aggression.
Once the stage is set for further discussions, gauged by progress in the


154


-----

Section 1 Confidence Building and Arms Control

North Korean nuclear issue or inter-Korean relationship, the military will run
a previously-agreed Joint Military Commission to devise peaceful measures to
relieve threats and to provide military support for a peaceful Peninsula.
When the North attempts to nullify the NLL during the course of
discussions, the ROK military will consistently espouse its initial position that
“the NLL has functioned as a de facto maritime demarcation line for the past
50 years, and that it should strictly abide by the line in the future.”

Repatriation and Settlements of ROK POWs


Repatriation of prisoners of war (POWs) took place in accordance with the Armistice

Agreement in 1953. However, a considerable number of POWs excluded at the time are

still forced to remain in the North.

The ROK government is seeking ways to: verify the status of POWs still alive in the

North; allow reunion and ensure repatriation; safely repatriate POWs and their families

who escaped from the North to a third country; and assist settlements of repatriated

POWs in the South.

1. ROK POWs from the Korean War


During the Korean War, the
United Nations (UN) Forces and
the Communist Forces exchanged
POWs on three occasions from
April 1953 to January 1954. Despite
the UN estimate of 82,000 ROK
soldiers as missing in action (MIA), Signing of the agreement by the UN Forces

and the Communist Forces for exchange of

only 8,343 have been repatriated. wounded POWs (April 11, 1953)
Therefore, a considerable number
of POWs are presumed to have been forced to remain in the North.
Since 1953, when the first POW exchange took place and to the 1960s, the
UN Forces continued to request repatriation of remaining POWs via the
United Nations Military Armistice Commission (UNCMAC). However, the


156


-----

Section 2 Repatriation and Settlements of ROK POWs

North maintained their position
that all POWs were transferred to
the Neutral Nations Repatriation
Commission and there remain no
further POWs detained. The issue
had also failed to be dealt with
during the sporadically held inter- UN POWs returning to the South through the

Gate to Freedom after the signing of the

Korean talks since the 1970s. Armistice Agreement
As of October 2008, the ROK
government has formed a list of 560 ROK POWs presumed to be alive in the
North based on statements from North Korean defectors and repatriated
POWs. As they are now in their 70s and 80s, the issue requires an immediate
solution.


2. The Government’s Efforts

A. Verification, Reunion, and Repatriation of the ROK POW
Since the return of the late Army
Lieutenant Cho Chang-ho in 1994, the
ROK government began to review POW
issues. As part of humanitarian and
reconciliatory measures, it prioritized
POW status verification and repatriation
during inter-Korean talks.
During the Ministerial-level Talks and
Inter-Korea Red Cross Talks following
the June 2000 Summit, the two sides
agreed to resolve POW issues alongside

Retirement ceremony for repatriated POWs

that of dispersed families. They agreed
during the 7th Red Cross Talks (February 2006) to tackle the issue by
“including status verification of those missing during the war into the issue of


157


-----

Chapter 6 Military Support for Peace on the Korean Peninsula

separated families.”Such principle was reconfirmed during the 20th
Ministerial-level Talks (February 2007) and 8th Red Cross Talks (April 2007).
As a result, the status of 25 POWs was verified, and among them 11 were
able to reunite with their families in the South.
In the meantime, the government exerted efforts to safely repatriate POWs
and their family members who escaped from the North to third countries.
Once the status of an escaped POW is verified, the ROK government protects
them as they do for Korean nationals living abroad, and leverages diplomatic
ties to have them repatriated swiftly and safely. Due to such measures, 76
POWs and 161 family members were repatriated through a third country
from 1994 to December 2008. The current status is shown in Table 6-6.


Table 6-6. Status of POWs and Their Families Repatriated through a Third

|Family members|161|-|2|5|8|9|12|9|10|34|18|32|13|9|



B. Supporting Settlements of Repatriated POWs
MND has established a legal foundation such as the Act on Repatriation
and Treatment for Korean Prisoners of War, in order to support settlements
for repatriated POWs and their family members.


Supporting Settlements for ROK POWs under the Act on
Repatriation and Treatment for Korean Prisoners of War

- Settlement Subsidy: A junior enlisted to be promoted to staff sergeant and pay 50years worth of salary, pension, and aid for residential settlement

- Free medical support: Free medical treatment of up to 10 million won a year

- Family support: Provision to the North Korean widow and children of a POW who died
in the North


In 2008, discussions to explore solutions for POW repatriation and
settlement were initiated via repatriated POW invitational talks and expert

workshops. In line with such
initiatives, an incorporated Family
Union of Korean POWs Detained
in North Korea was established in
August 2008 with approval from
the MND to promote POWs’selfhelp and self-sufficiency. In Octo
An invitation event for repatriated POWs

ber 2008, a pilot program utilizing (National Cemetery, October 2007)

agencies was launched to support POWs’adjustment to the society.


3. The Way Ahead

MND will exert efforts to repatriate and settle POWs through government-led
coordination and cooperation with the civil sector equipped with expertise.
Foremost, it plans to continuously raise POW issues at inter-Korean talks to
induce the North to admit to the existence of remaining POWs. Efforts to
solve separated family issues will continuously be made, while practical and
creative approaches reflecting changes in the inter-Korean relationship will
be sought. In addition, MND will do its best to safely repatriate POWs and
families defected to third countries. In particular, firm measures to guarantee
the safety of those peoples will be devised. Diplomatic efforts to maintain
cooperative ties with such governments will be made as well.
Taking into account the repatriated POWs’challenges to settle in the ROK
due to the long years spent in the North, policies that focus on their
successful settlements will be implemented. POWs face the following
challenges: difficulties in adapting to a new society and culture; treating
illness sustained by forced-labor; concerns about family members left behind;
and communication with current family members. The ROK government will
devise a system in cooperation with the civil sector in order to best solve
those personal problems which the nation may not be equipped to remedy.

Chapter 7 Professional Armed Forces

Section1. Defense Manpower Management


In order to actively respond to changes in the security environment, the capabilities of

defense manpower, which constitutes the foundation of national defense, need to be

maximized.

The ROK Ministry of National Defense (MND) is arranging the military personnel

management system to cultivate active duty personnel into professional experts in their

functional areas. MND is also increasing the proportion of civilian and female workforce

in order to improve the structural diversity of national defense personnel.

1. Military Personnel Management Based on Expertise


In the process of reorganizing into a technology-intensive military
structure, MND is overhauling its sizable mandatory servicemen-intensive
manpower structure into a structure that centers on professional officers and
noncommissioned officers (NCOs). In this regard, MND is planning to
establish a military personnel management system to foster active duty
service members into experts in their functional areas.

A. Establishing Military Personnel Management System
Based on Professionalism
The legacy military personnel management system that formerly gave
weight to equality and balanced distribution is now transforming into a
system that places higher value on professionalism and capabilities. By


162


-----

Section 1 Defense Manpower Management

preparing new personnel management models; establishing limitless
competition system; and building a position management system that assigns
the right talents to the right post, it will further uphold professional
development while creating a fair, transparent, and reliable culture where
individuals yield to results.
To that end, MND has provided an institutional foundation by enacting the
Directive on Personnel Management Based on Professionalism in August
2008. Key details are as follows:
First, it constructed a functional personnel management system that
systematically administers the career path of each respective specialty area,
reaching the highest level of Lieutenant Generals (Vice-Admiral) or Major
Generals (Rear Admiral).
Second, it adopted a promotion management system where candidates
from 2-3 graduation classes limitlessly compete with each other instead of
having a single graduation class of separate commissioning institutions
competing amongst themselves. As such, this will enable the selection of
best available experts. Third, by improving the customary practice of giving
command opportunities to all promoted individuals, the position
management system now assigns command opportunities to candidates that
prove suitable for commanding and assigns high specialty functional
positions to candidates that prove to be functionally qualified.
In addition, MND will enhance the utility of manpower management by
revising rules and regulations of the system: invigorating programs to benefit
long-term service members, including a term-limited promotion system, and
an increase in honorable discharge funds.


B. Complementing the Professional National Defense
Manpower System
MND has categorized its professional national defense manpower[1)]

consisting of active service members into five types, including those in
international affairs and those in policy. Yet, it has been assessed to be more
or less inadequate in terms of managing those who are on time-sensitive

National Defense Manpower
Defense expert personnel
are categorized into five
types, experts in international affairs, policy, technology and functions, special
areas, and acquisition.

163


-----

Chapter 7 Professional Armed Forces


missions, due to shortages of professional manpower in various fields such
as military personnel with languages skills and Foreign Area Officers (FAO).
That being said, MND is establishing an effective personnel management
system that efficiently fosters and manages FAO who perform their duties in
foreign missions and international negotiations, as well as professional
policy manpower such as those in defense policy, military strategy, and
military diplomacy. Through these efforts, MND will specify posts filled by
expert personnel as well as standards that designate such posts, while
smoothing the system that links assignment-education-personnel
management-utilization in each area of expertise.
The enactment of the National Defense Reform Act has provided the legal
foundation to foster and manage experts in jointness.[2)] However, because of
the overly stringent criteria in defining experts in jointness, fostering a
workforce specializing in jointness has been challenging. In response, MND
is amending related laws and regulations that will appropriately expand the
scope and human resource pool that defines jointness.

2. Diversifying Defense Manpower Structure


2) Joint Professional Military Manpower
Refers to those experts with
qualifications in jointness.
They are assigned to the
ROK Joint Chiefs of Staff,
the ROK-US Combined
Forces Command (CFC),
and other joint units.

164


As modern weapon systems have become more precise and diverse, the
process of acquiring and managing required force capabilities are also
becoming increasingly more complex and specialized. Furthermore, the
spectrum for national defense has widened to cover areas such as disaster
relief and counter-terrorism, while the linkage with other social areas
(politics, economy, society, and culture) has become more salient. In order
to flexibly deal with such situational changes, MND is currently strengthening
the diversification of the defense manpower structure.

A. Boosting Professional Expertise in MND Headquarters
Implemented from 2005, MND is reorganizing the Headquarters (HQ)’
personnel structure to maximize harmonization between civilan officials and


-----

Section 1 Defense Manpower Management


active duty personnel. This is to raise employee expertise, maintain
continuity of policies, and improve objectivity in policy formulations.
MND’s restructuring efforts are geared towards annually increasing its civil
servants ratio and further improving their respective field of expertise.
Increasing the number of the civilian officials in the Ministry’s HQ first
requires consensus within and outside of the military community, while
concurrently upgrading the professional capacities of each individual.
Furthermore, all positions within the Ministry’s HQ will be carefully
scrutinized in order to distinguish posts that are better suited for civilians and
for active duty personnel.
MND is devising various policies to elevate the level of expertise of its
civilian officials. Recent recruitments bring together civilian and military
experts as well as grade 5 civilian officials, while defense MBA core
programs and specialization courses are in operation. In addition, employing
a career development program (CDP)[3)] enables a constructive personnel
management system that closely connects assignments, expertise areas, and
education.

B. Utilizing Civilian Personnel and Improving the Personnel
Management System for the Military Civilian Workforce
Because defense affairs are carried out by complex entities combining
military and civilian personnel, it is also important to attract and make the
best of civilian talents in non-combat service areas.
In order to guarantee integrity of the ROK military’s combat organization
(missions) and to enhance efficiency in force management, MND is
consolidating the use of its civilian resources. Accordingly, adopting civilian
employees by the military is being expanded in parallel with its increased
outsourcing, private entrustment, and privatization efforts.
The military civilian workforce carries out specialized administration,
technology, and support related functions in areas such as force build up
and maintenance of military capacities, which plays significant roles in
maintaining the expertise of defense affairs.

However, the classification system of
the military civilian workforce is very
complicated (61 job lines in 15 job
groups), compared to that of the
regular public service members (32 job
lines in two job groups). MND is
scheduled to simplify the overly- Education to upgrade military

complex classification system by
amending the Enforcement Decree of the Act on Personnel Affairs of Military
Civilian Employees. At the same time, the Ministry will improve efficiency of
personnel utilization by reviewing the requirements for each job groups.
Furthermore, an all-around personnel management system for the military
civilian workforce that covers recruitment-assignments-education-promotion
will be enforced. To this end, MND will devise until 2012 a comprehensive
plan that includes: simplifying the hiring system; expanding the use of
defense contractors; reorganizing position structures; and improving training
and education systems.


C. Efficient Utilization of Defense Female Workforce
There has been an increasing number of female hiring which facilitated the
conditions for MND to develop its female-related policies such as protecting
maternal rights and promoting gender equality and so forth.

(1) Status and Utilization of Defense Female Personnel[4) ]

Female public officials represent approximately 32 percent of the entire
number of public officials in the Ministry. Female military civilians represent
approximately 16.5 percent of the total military civilians. Table 7-1 shows the
status of female public officials and military civilians.


4) Defense Female Personnel
It collectively refers to female
employees serving at MND,
female service members
and employees listed as
Korean Armed Forces.

The intent is to increase the number of female officers and NCOs from
5,400 in 2008 to 11,600 in 2020. In doing so, the percentage of female
officers will increase from 3.1% to 7%, while the percentage of female NCOs
will increase from 2.2% to 5%. Table 7-2 shows the annual employment
plan.

The basic principle behind utilizing
the female workforce is that “all
qualified service members, regardless
of gender, will be assigned to any job
and will carry out the same missions
during peace and war.”

Educating female platoon leaders

Assignment of female service
members is limited only in the following cases: regiment or lower units
where missions are mostly close ground combat; units that carry out special
warfare operations or long-range reconnaissance missions; and units and
positions whose mission requires physical conditions unsuitable for most
females.

Chapter 7 Professional Armed Forces

Presently, female service members assume posts including command or
staff positions in field units, fighter pilots, crewmembers on combat ships,
and even positions in overseas dispatch units. In 2008, there were a total of
28 female service members dispatched overseas that conducted their
missions in places such as Iraq, Lebanon, Nepal, etc.

(2) Promoting Policies for Defense Female Personnel
Since 2007, the implementation of the Defense Policy’s Gender Impact
Assessment System,[5)] which was first introduced in 2005, has been expanded
to each military service, and has been enforced in furtherance of protecting
maternity related issues. Specifically, MND
amended existing statutes that allow: proper
remunerations to those who fill in the voids
left by service members on maternity/
childcare leave; flexible service systems for
childcare;[6)] guaranteeing leave of absence
for miscarriages or stillbirth; increasing Educating military consultants for

minority in the military circles--in adjusting to their unit of service and to
provide counseling services on the difficulties they confront. Supplementary
education for consultants takes place more than once a year in order to
improve the quality of counseling.
MND also works to create “a gender equal society,”which is in line with
the government’s policy direction. Since 2003, the Korea Institute for Gender
Equality Promotion and Education (KIGEPE), a subsidiary institution under
the Ministry of Gender Equality (MOGE), conducted “gender awareness”[7)]

sessions to faculty of education institutions and personnel on educationrelated posts in each Service. As of June 2008, over 1,300 completed the
course and 18,000 service members posted in remote areas participated
through private non-profit organizations.

order to computerize and automate
personnel services.
DHRMS consolidates the programs
currently operated by each branch of Benchmarking the human resources system of

interfaces with six MND systems such as logistics and mobilization
information systems, as well as three non-MND systems including those from
the Military Manpower Administration (MMA) and the Ministry of Patriots and
Veterans Affairs (MPVA). In the future, new functions such as payroll
administration, e-Learning, and policy management will be additionally
developed while allowing interfacing capabilities with the Battlefield

Section 2 Strengthening Training and Education

Section2.

Strengthening Training and Education


Systematic and sustainable training and education are necessary in order for individual

service members and units to exert their maximum combat capabilities during a crisis

and achieve success in war.

MND is improving its defense training and education system and cultivating talents with

specialized military knowledge. Furthermore, MND is promoting “strong warriors” and a

“strong military” by executing realistic training simulations to guarantee impermeability

against engagement with any enemy.

1. Developing the National Defense Training and
Education System


MND conducts various training and education to foster “strong warriors”
and a “strong military”that is impenetrable. Through such trainings the
military fosters combatants with a warrior’s disposition; creative military
experts equipped with appropriate technical skills and leadership; and an
elite force with high standards of combat-readiness.

A. National Defense Training and Education System
In order to effectively carry out its training programs, MND amended the
Directive on Defense Training and Education in November 2008, and is
currently in the drafting process of such defense training and education
policy outline.
As shown in Figure 7-2, the national defense training and education system
is divided into military education, human resources development, and unit
training.


171


-----

Chapter 7 Professional Armed Forces

Military education can further be divided into candidate training that
transforms civilians into officers and NCOs, and refresher training that
augments duty performing abilities. Experts required by the three Services
are fostered and “jointness”is improved through systematic education that
reflects specific missions.

education. Professional education cultivates military experts capable of
leading the establishment of a technology-intensive force structure.
Capability improvement education includes increasing the values of officers
in their respective expert area of interest and potentials, as well as upgrading
service members’capacities in connection with the national lifelong
education policy. To that end, the Ministry provides domestic and
international graduate level degree programs, conducts research education,
and offers opportunities for self-development such as offering courses to
obtain college credits during times of service.
Unit training is divided into individual training and collective training that
fosters war-fighting capabilities. The Ministry develops IT-based scientific
training systems to maximize integrated capabilities of battlefield functions. It
also develops field maneuver training methods in association with War
Games and the combat command training model.


B. Improving Conditions for Defense Training and Education
MND has upgraded its training facilities to minimize inconveniences
caused by outdoor field training to the local community, while enhancing IT
and scientific features of training that complies with recent accomplishments
of information technology as well as prospects for future warfare.
In order to improve the conditions related to military education, the
Ministry plans to design a distance learning system (shown in Figure 7-3) by
introducing the defense broadband convergence network. The plan is to
field the network by 2009 in order to provide timely education for the service
members. In so doing, the Ministry will automate the education planningexecution-assessment process and provide a customized education
opportunity for the users.

As part of a human resources development mechanism, the Ministry seeks
to offer self-development opportunities to satisfy the desire for learning by
service members. To this end, the Ministry has been improving related
systems and also installing Cyber Knowledge Information Rooms down to
company-level units.
To actively cope with the changes in future warfare, unit training will
employ advanced technical training systems. MND plans to expand the
current battalion-level Korea Combat Training Center (KCTC) combat
exercises up to brigade-level units. Furthermore, it will increase the use of
simulators for equipment (tanks, armored vehicles, combat ships or jetfighters) whose actual maneuver (or live firing) can be limited during
training.
Battle command training systems adopted from War Game models are
being devised. In this regard, an LVC System [8)] that incorporates advanced
live fire maneuver exercises (Live), simulator-based training (Virtual), and
battle command training program (Constructive) is being fabricated.

Section 2 Strengthening Training and Education


The ROK military has seen difficulties in securing appropriate training areas
due to rapid urbanization and regional developments. Therefore, MND plans
to consolidate scarcely-used and small training facilities scattered across the
country, and then re-organize them into large training facilities befitting the
corps-level echelon, in the meantime consolidating smaller training facilities
suitable at the division/brigade-level echelon. MND has also made efforts to
assure safety and to minimize inconveniences to local residents residing in
nearby training facilities. These efforts include installing a safety wall from
ricochet rounds,[9)] erecting sound-proof walls, establishing car wash sites, and
completing pavements in maneuver routes. It also includes distributing ecofriendly training equipment such as silencers for individual small arms and
tank guns.

subjects, and military science


MND is developing a system for candidate training and refresher training
that reinforces service members’military expertise, leadership, duty
performance, and potentials.
The military academies have moved away from the old simplistic
education curriculums and introduced theme-oriented curriculums [10)] starting
in 2008, along with sending an increasing number of cadets via exchange
programs with foreign military academies. In addition, the service academies
plan to recruit more talented civilian professors.
Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) is planning to assess the quality of
its cadets and education system and reflect the outcomes to its selection and
resource allocation process. Such efforts will improve overall ROTC
education condition while recruiting well-qualified junior officers.
The Branch schools and colleges of each military service are improving
their curriculums, education contents, and conditions in order to foster
military experts. In particular, they have systemized the levels and realms of
joint military education by each course to establish the concept of future joint

battlefield operations, and synthesize them into the regular education
program.
Meanwhile, in 2008, the Korea National Defense University (KNDU)
launched a new Doctorate degree program for the first time to produce top
experts in national security and military affairs. Table 7-3 shows the current
status of the program.


Table 7-3. Status of the Doctorate Program at KNDU

|Degree name|Years of study|Quota|Students|Areas where graduates will be utilized|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Doctorate in military science|3 years|15 person (3 per major)|•Active service member of captain or higher •Public officials of 5th grade or higher •Defense-related civilians|•Policy department experts •Professors •National defense- related research posts|



※ Specialization: military strategy, defense resource management, operational analysis, information
technology, weapons systems


3. Developing Military Human Resources

Annually, the ROK military provides a pool of human resource numbering
270,000 active mandatory servicemen and 16,000 officers/NCOs to the
society. Accordingly, MND is devising policies to develop military human
resources that allow service members and the enlisted to achieve selfdevelopment while carrying out their missions.


A. Fostering Military Experts
The Ministry has established and implemented mid-term plans for yearly
education outsourcing so as to systematically foster experts that can lead the
transformation of the military into a technology-intensive structure.
Expert personnel selected between 2007 and 2008 included 611 master’s
degree and 101 doctoral degree holders. In 2008, the Ministry increased the
number of positions required to foster appropriate numbers of education,


176


-----

Section 2 Strengthening Training and Education

defense policy, research, and acquisition experts from 1,964 to 2,600.
The Ministry has sent Masters and Doctorate candidates to world’s top 100
universities with competitive advantages. Table 7-4 shows the current status
of students in degree courses at home and abroad.

In addition, the Ministry has dispatched officers and cadets to defense
universities, command and general staffs colleges, branch schools, and
military academies abroad to acquire advanced military knowledge and
foster regional experts by countries. The countries under exchange programs
have increased from 28 in 2007 to 31 in 2008, and the trend will continue.
Table 7-5 shows the current status.

MND is setting educational objectives for different ranks in order to satisfy
officers’and NCOs’desire to learn and upgrade their capabilities through
lifelong education. The objective is to have more than 70 percent of the
officers and more than 50 percent of the NCOs obtain master’s degrees by
2012.


177


-----

Chapter 7 Professional Armed Forces

B. Improving Service Members’Capabilities
Approximately 82 percent or more of the enlisted joined the service while
enrolled at colleges. Therefore, MND is offering opportunities to continue
their education by providing chances to obtain credits for their college
courses. In April 2007, it provided an institutional basis for service members
to acquire up to six credits during military service by amending the Military
Service Act, the Higher Education Act, the Act on Academic Credit
Recognitions, et cetera. In addition, the
Ministry encourages service members to
continue their education in their units by
running Cyber Knowledge Information
Rooms. By August 2008, the Ministry
installed 39,900 PCs, 80.2 percent of the total
planned. The Ministry plans to install a total Knowledge Information RoomPanoramic view of a Cyber
of 53,000 PCs by 2009.
A total of nine universities are accepting credits obtained through military
education institutions as of the 1st semester of 2008. Table 7-6 shows the
status of the credit recognition system.

Furthermore, some universities introduced a credit bank system to

recognize credits from training courses during military service.

Military courses recognized by universities have increased from 82

programs at 18 institutions in 2007, to 131 programs at 23 institutions

in 2008.

MND is developing a system where certain military job skills can be

recognized in the civilian sector as well. Such initiatives include

Section 2 Strengthening Training and Education

exempting written tests in nationally-recognized certificate exams or

converting military licenses into a civilian one. In 2003, the six

national certificate exams in which written tests were exempted for

military experts were coupled with 16 additional exams in 2007 that

included automobile maintenance, etc. Table 7-7 shows the details.


|Table 7-7.|National Certificate Tests Exempted (a total of 22)|

Certificate and 4,162 passed Exams for a Technician Certificate.
Compared to 2007, total applicants increased by 12 percent, with passing
rates at 34 percent, a rate higher than that of the civilians (27 percent).
In addition, by establishing special
programs, MND is cultivating technical
experts through a cooperate system between
industries, academia, and the military. In
2008, for the first time, 500 students from ten
schools were chosen as a test case. The Training in maintenance of wired
Ministry plans to expand such efforts by equipment for tactical communication
assessing their performance.
In the future, the Ministry will upgrade quality management of military
certificates and increase the spread of such skills to the society by enacting
the Defense Technical Qualifications Act.

4. Realistic Training and Exercises

In particular, the exercises[11)] and training are focusing on post-operational
control (OPCON) transition, while reinforcing joint combined exercises and
training [12)] and training by each Service.

A. Combined/Joint Training and Exercises


(1) Ulchi-Freedom Guardian Exercise
Ulchi Freedom Guardian (UFG) Exercise is a ROK-U.S. Combined Exercise
in preparation of the OPCON Transition to improve operational capabilities
of the ROK Joint Chiefs of Staff (ROK JCS) and U.S. Korea Command
(KORCOM). The exercise will be carried out from 2008 to 2012, and consists
of military command post and government exercises.

Section 2 Strengthening Training and Education

The exercise was established when Focus Lens, a UNC-led military
exercise which began in 1954, and Ulchi Exercise, the military support
training by the ROK government, which was initiated by the January 21st
incident in 1968, developed into a comprehensive military and government
command post exercise (CPX) using computer war gaming. The exercise
was renamed from Ulchi-Focus Lens (UFL) to Ulchi-Freedom Guardian in
2008.
The exercise is conducted between late August to early September, in the
order of crisis management exercise, military and government exercise, and
after action review board (AARB).
Administrative agencies of a city, county,
district or above, major mobilizing industries,
army units above the corps-level echelon,

American side. The exercise is conducted in
the order of crisis management exercise,
computer simulation-based CPX, and AARB.
Foal-Eagle (FE) Exercise first began as a

ROK-U.S. Combined Air Assault

small-scale rear-area defense training in Training
1961, then added concepts of combined and
joint operations, as well as combined special warfare operations in 1975. In
1982, the spectrum of the exercise was expanded to include rear-area
defense, stabilization operations against enemy Special Operations Force
(SOF) infiltration and assaults, RSOI,[13)] special warfare operations, ground
maneuver operations, amphibious maneuver operations, and combat air
operations.
KR/FE Exercise further developed into a ROK-U.S. Combined Exercise that
runs both CPX and field training exercise (FTX).

(3) Taegeuk Exercise
Taegeuk Exercise is an annual CPX conducted to reinforce operational
capabilities of the ROK JCS and to derive requirements for joint forces and
unit structure developments.
A working-level exercise was conducted in 1995 to reinforce self-reliant
operational capabilities of the ROK JCS in the wake of the transfer of
peacetime operational control in 1994. In 1996, it was named the Aprok
River Exercise, and developed into a de facto joint exercise in which the
ROK JCS and Operations Command participated.
The exercise then was renamed Taegeuk Exercise in 2004. Starting in 2005,
it utilized Taegeuk Joint Operations Simulation (JOS), a joint operation
simulation model developed by the ROK JCS. From 2008, the exercise
focused on improving operational capabilities and force enhancements in
preparation of OPCON Transition.

training conducted in conditions similar to
that of an actual battlefield, using advanced
scientific technology such as MILES equipment,[14)] data communication, and
satellites, and also by employing opposition forces (OPFOR). Presently, the
training is conducted at the battalion level but will be extended to regiments
while mechanized unit training will be involved as well.
BCTP is a computer simulation training to reinforce commanding abilities
of commanders and staffs. Since 1999, the program applied the selfdeveloped Changjo 21 Model [15)] and Hwarang 21 Model[16)] in order to
familiarize the participants with operating integrated forces as well as
corps/division/regiment/battalion-level commanding procedures under a
realistic situation. Also, a designated controller and Opposition Force are
employed for corps and division-level trainings, and Battle Command
Training Group is tasked with hosting the after action review (AAR) session.
In the future, training will be reinforced by involving field live-maneuver
trainings.

operations, amphibious operations, and special warfare training. Training for
rescue and search operations are conducted between Korea and Japan,
Korea and China, and Korea and Russia.
Furthermore, the Navy seeks to strengthen multinational combined
operations and international ties by participating in RIMPAC.[17)] West Pacific
Submarine Escape and Rescue Exercise (PAC-REACH)[18)] is also an effective
exercise with the Navy at the helm. Such exercises are regularly conducted
between ten countries including the U.S., UK, Japan, Canada, and Australia.
The ROK Navy will actively participate in peace-seeking multinational
naval exercises designed to counter military, transnational, and non-military
threats. They include the COBRA Gold[19)] and ASEAN Regional Forum
exercise to foster maritime security cooperation.[20)]

Cruise training is for Naval Academy midshipmen, who sequentially cruise
along four different designated sea routes [21)] for 100 to 150 days each year. In
doing so, the Navy enhances its military diplomacy by making goodwill visits
to allied and friendly nations while improving midshipmen’s professional
skills and broadening international perspectives.

(3) Air Force
The Air Force reinforces realistic training focusing on combat missions in
order to maintain readiness that can rapidly
counter all situations and threats, and to
establish an optimal operational posture.
Key Air Force trainings include: defensive
counter-air, offensive counter-air, air
interdiction, and close air support.
Defensive counter-air training seeks to
block enemy air and space capacities

aircraft employing enemy infiltration tactics.
Offensive counter-air training involves offensively operating air and space
capacities in enemy Area of Operations (AO) to achieve air superiority. It can
increase its effectiveness by operating alongside in-depth strike power
including surface-to-surface missiles and special warfare units.
Air interdiction training is used to confuse, delay, and destroy potential
enemy capacities before it is effectively used against friendly ground and
naval forces. By limiting augmentation, re-supply, and mobility, friendly
forces can disrupt or delay enemy’s operational tempo.
Close air support training is utilized to directly support ground and naval
forces. Training includes offensive efforts using nighttime equipment such as
night vision goggles, and involves live ordnance bombing as well as live
firing of precision guided munitions (PGMs).
In addition, the Air Force trains for counter-fire operations against enemy
long range artillery and counter-infiltration operations against enemy SOF. It
also utilizes scientific training systems that include ground simulation training
equipment and air combat maneuvering instrumentation in order to
overcome limits involved with live-maneuver trainings.

Section1.

Advanced Defense Resource Management


The cost of maintenance for weapons systems is rising with increasing precision and

diversification of such weapons systems, thus, paving the way for emerging technologies

regarding resource management. Such changes require constructive development in the

field of defense resource management.

The ROK Ministry of National Defense (MND) is improving efficiency and capacities for

logistics support by establishing a Defense Logistics Integrated Information System

(DELIIS) as well as a logistics support performance management system. In addition, by

increasing private entrustments and military executive agencies, the Ministry seeks to

improve efficiency in resource management.

1. Efficient Use of Defense Resources


MND is developing a logistics resource management system to reflect the
changes in future warfare. It is also establishing an integrated information
system for logistics by applying the latest information technology, and
pursuing an objective evaluation of logistics support.

A. Establishing a Defense Logistics Integrated Information
System (DELIIS)
In order to visualize logistics[1)] and improve logistics supporting capacities,
MND is systematically establishing a DELIIS. Figure 8-1 shows its conceptual plans.
The first stage involves developing an information system by function and


1) Visualization of Logistics
A comprehensive information
system to consolidate data
regarding the size, status,
and location of logistics, as
well as resources scheduled
for acquisition and those
under maintenance.

improving their performance. It also seeks to develop an equipment
maintenance information system by 2008, and improve the efficiency of the
aging munitions and materiel information system by June 2009. The second
stage involves integrating information systems and reinforcing interface. By
2014, a single DELIIS will be established by integrating materiel, munitions,
and equipment maintenance systems, while its capacities to interface with
other information systems will be reinforced. The third stage involves
establishing u-DELIIS. From 2015, the Ministry will continue to develop the
system by utilizing newest technologies.

Chapter 8 Pragmatic Defense Management System


MND plans to introduce advanced information technology into the field of
logistics. First, radio frequency identification (RFID)[4)] technology has been
introduced and applied experimentally in the field of munitions
management. Through this technology, receipt/transfer and storage
management of logistics supplies can be improved. In addition, it allows for
real time tracking and management of logistics supplies in transit.
In order to improve ROK-U.S. combined logistics support capacity such as
visualizing logistics movements, MND has adopted a pilot program for GITV[5)] system, while closely coordinating to obtain ROK-U.S. interoperability.

B. Establishing Logistics Support Performance Management
System
The current logistics support performance management system is a
supplier-based (logistics support units) system, leaving difficulties in
measuring the satisfaction of final users (combat units, maintenance units). It
is also insufficient to assess the system’s overall contribution to combat units’
readiness posture.
Thus, MND seeks to establish a user-based logistics support performance
management system that evaluates the logistics process from the users’
perspective. In 2006, it developed a performance indexes which reflects the
characteristics of each Service. In 2007 and 2008, it designated test units from
each Service to evaluate results using the index. The process will be
extended across the military by 2009. Table 8-1 shows the performance
indexes.


4) Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
A technology that reads the
information contained in a
thin and flat serial-numbered
tag through radio frequency.

5) Global In Transit Visibility
(G-ITV)
An RFID technology-based
infrastructure set up between military bases of U.S.
and friendly nations to
support exchange of information regarding status and
inventory of materiel between friendly forces.


6) Customer Waiting Time
(CWT)
The time it takes for the user
to receive the requested
goods after having applied
for the goods.

7) Repair Cycle Time (RCT)
The time it takes for the user
to receive the repaired
goods.


Table 8-1. User-based Logistics Performance Indexes

|Function|Performance Index|
|---|---|
|Common|Customer Waiting Time (CWT),6) equipment operability|
|Demand|Accuracy in forecast of demand|
|Procurement|Required time for procurement|
|Supply|Waiting time, inventory, satisfaction in clothing & food|
|Equipment|Repair Cycle Time (RCT)7)|


194


-----

Section 1 Advanced Defense Resource Management

Once a user-based performance management system is established, it will
not only improve user satisfaction, but also logistics readiness posture. The
efficient management of resources will contribute to cutting down the overall
budget. Each Service’s efforts to develop and improve MND’s initiatives will
have a synergistic effect on the development of logistics systems.


2. Reinforcing International Logistics Cooperation

A. Logistics Cooperation with the U.S.
In the field of logistics, MND is developing a future-oriented cooperation
structure with the U.S. that reflects changes in the security environment such
as wartime operational control (OPCON) transition.
By undergoing negotiations to bring in War Reserve Stock for Allies
(WRSA),[8)] the two sides signed a memorandum of agreement during the
ROK-U.S. Security Consultative Meeting (SCM) in October 2008. Following
up on such agreements, ROK brought in 259,000 tons of quality-assured
munitions, equipment, and materiel the military needs.[9)] The residual stocks
are to be shipped out or become demilitarized by the U.S. by 2020. A winwin agreement was derived during the negotiation process, through which
the alliance was solidified even further.
The two nations plan to further reinforce cooperation in munitions
technology in order to maintain the best munitions support system. In
addition, a database to improve interoperability of munitions among Pacific
nations including the U.S. will be established.
MND is promoting a project invested jointly between the ROK and U.S. by
implementing U.S. technologies in order to dispose of munitions in an ecofriendly way. As one part of the demilitarization facilities (DEFAC),
construction of an incinerator was started in June 2006 in Yeongdong-gun,
Chungcheongbuk-do, which was completed in December 2007. Remaining
facilities are to be completed by 2009.


8) War Reserve Stock for
Allies (WRSA)
U.S. war reserve materiel to
support its allies in times of a
military crisis. It has been
consistently adopted in
Korea since 1974 in contributing to deterrence of war
on the Peninsula.

9) Receiving Reserves
155mm artillery rounds,
81mm mortar rounds,
105mm tank artillery, air-tosurface missiles, general
munitions, and 2.75 inch
rocket munitions.


195


-----

Chapter 8 Pragmatic Defense Management System

B. Diversifying International Logistics Cooperation
By diversifying logistics cooperation with allied and friendly nations, MND
is facilitating defense industry exports while supporting military diplomacy.
In order to secure stable sources of logistics supplies during wartime and
peacetime, Korea has signed Mutual Logistics Support Agreements (MLSA)
with four nations--Thailand (1991),
Australia (1998), New Zealand
(2007), and Turkey (2008)--and is
pursuing similar deals with the
Philippines, Indonesia, and Israel.
MND has transferred ships and
aircraft to Thailand, the Philippines, The ROK and Turkey signing Mutual Logistics
Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, and Support Agreement (Seoul, May 28, 2008)
Mongolia. It is also promoting a
transfer of war supplies to Indonesia, Peru, Mongolia, Cambodia, and
Ghana. In order to strategically connect foreign transfer of war supplies with
military cooperation and defense industry exports, the Ministry established
and implemented a Directive on Transfer of Unused Logistics Supplies to
Foreign Countries.


3. Increasing Private Entrustment to Improve
Efficiency in Defense Management

A. Gradual Increase of Private Entrustment
In order to upgrade efficiency in non-combat management areas with little
relation to combat operations, the Ministry plans to progressively expand
private entrustments. Non-combat areas under consideration are facility
management, automobile maintenance, laundry/alteration/repair services,
and welfare. Areas subject to entrustments and yearly plans are as shown in
Figure 8-2.

B. Selecting Private Companies for Entrustment and Management Methods
MND objectively assesses company performance, productivity growth, and
cost-cuts to select companies for entrustment. Contracts are detailed and
reflect work coverage, settlement of costs and payment conditions, contract
period, and cancellation clauses.
The Ministry plans to consistently determine user unit’s satisfaction in order
to select appropriate companies and to improve qualities of their services.


C. Wartime Duties and Operational Security
When signing contracts, MND specifies details on wartime and peacetime
duties. Moreover, it plans to modify related statutes in preparation of
potential service stoppage caused by labor strikes, etc.
To assure operational security, the Ministry specifies such responsibility in
contracts and consistently inspects and trains related companies.


197


-----

Chapter 8 Pragmatic Defense Management System


4. Designation and Management of Military Executive
Agencies[10)]

MND designates and manages the organization in non-combat sectors
capable of improving defense management efficiency through
implementation of private management methods as the military executive
agency. Such efforts will improve the organization’s efficiency while
transforming it to provide high-quality services. The system does not merely
mean that a business expert hired through public recruitment procedures will
replace active duty personnel as agency chief. Its value lies in the fact it
helps transform the organization into a more flexible and professional one by
providing the agency chief with self-regulated rights in business
management.

Agency System
Designating agency chiefs
through a public recruitment
process, and delegating
organizational, HR, and
financial rights to those

198


A. Plans Forward
Military executive agencies are selected via free competition and those
whose performances can be precisely evaluated, such as maintenance
depots, supply depots, computer offices, printing depots, rear-area hospitals,
and welfare groups are targets. Plans forward and management outline are
as shown in Figure 8-3.

B. Establishing Related Statutes and Guidance
Legal groundwork for operating military executive agencies was laid out
when the Designation and Management of Military Executive Agency Act
was enacted in March 2008 and its Enforcement Ordinance was established
in June. Details specified in the Act are: Hiring of the agency chief following
public recruitment procedures; the agency chief’s self-regulated rights;
signing performance contracts and ways to evaluate performance;
designation of the military executive agency and conditions set for
management; and installation and management of the operation council and
committee

selection[11)] in November 2008. The plan is to regularize the process through
such measures as public recruitment of agency chiefs and incrementally
increase the number of military executive agencies every year.
The Ministry will gauge performance indexes in order to assure adequacy

Section 2 Defense Management as a New Economic Growth Engine

Section2. Defense Management as a New
Economic Growth Engine


MND is securing a budget that allows for the construction and maintenance of forces in

accordance with its security threat analysis, thereby maximizing performance of defense

management through reasonable allocation and execution of such budget.

Defense expenditure contributes not only to its fundamental function of national security,

but also to the development of the national economy. The Ministry is reinforcing its

policymaking efforts to make the defense industry into the engine for new economic growth.

1. The Significance of Defense Budget and Its
Social & Economic Contributions


A. Changes in Defense Budget Allocation
The proportion of defense budget in total government spending and gross
domestic product (GDP) has shifted according to changes in security and
social conditions.
Until the early 1980s, defense budget marked 5 percent of the GDP and 30
percent of the total government budget. This was due to the facilitation of
stably implementing military initiatives of the mid-70s regarding self-reliant
force improvements such as the Yulgok Project.[12)] In the meanwhile, due to
the financial crisis as well as increasing demand for social welfare, the trend
from the late 1980s until the early 2000s was to reduce the budget size.
Budget allocation has somewhat improved since, due to a full-scale pursuit
of military reform.
In 2008, the defense budget stood at 2.76 percent of the GDP and 15.2


12) Yulgok Project
It refers to an initiative from
1974 until 1992 to modernize the military with the
objective of establishing a
self-reliant defense posture.
The ROK military could have
capabilities to develop and
mass-produce M16 rifles,
Korea-type K-1 Tanks, etc.
to contribute to overall force
improvement through this
project.

※ Figures are based on general accounts.

B. Importance of Defense Budget Allocation that Reflects
Security Conditions
It is desirable to allocate defense budget in a level that strikes a balance
between force requirements based on security threats and national spending
capacity.
However, countries facing direct military confrontations like ROK must
allocate the defense budget in proportion to their “level of security threat.”
Despite the fact that the ROK’s security threat is among the highest, its
defense allocation ratio is lower compared to that of countries facing
disputes and confrontations. GDP-defense budget ratio for main countries
facing disputes and confrontations is shown in Table 8-2.

Confrontations

Section 2 Defense Management as a New Economic Growth Engine

C. Social and Economic Contributions of Defense Expenditure


(1) Defense Expenditure’s Effect on Industries
Maintaining a robust security posture by securing an appropriate amount
of defense budget bolsters economic growth and national development.
Moreover, defense expenditure not only serves its initial purpose of defense
but also generates a rippling effect through the economy by injecting funds
to various industrial sectors.
Labor costs from defense budget including servicemen/military civilians’
salary, generates demand through household expenditures and stimulates
industrial production. Project funds for weapons system acquisition
supplying materiel, and facility construction is spent on industrial sectors
such as manufacture and construction, etc., thereby increasing industrial
production, employment, and domestic income.
According to research results from the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses
(KIDA), the defense sector’s influence on industries is higher than the
industry average. Every 1,000 Korean won (KRW) spent in the defense
sector stimulates 1,709 KRW worth of production as well as an increase in
domestic income of 764 KRW. Moreover, defense spending of every billion
won stimulates the creation of 21 jobs, a positive contribution to
employment.

(2) Development of Civil Industrial Technologies via Defense R&D
Advanced technology developed via defense R&D is spread across the private
sector, offering opportunities for private companies to upgrade their productivity.
Since 1986, advanced technologies developed for defense purposes have
been transferred to private corporations, contributing to the growth of electrocommunication and mechanical industries. Examples are shown in Figure 8-5.

(3) Provision of Social Overhead Capital (SOC) and Technical
Experts
Airports, seaports and bridges constructed for military purposes are shared
with the local community in order to save national spending while
contributing to social overhead capitals.
The military is a “supplier of national technical personnel”by fostering
national technical experts and conducting its own military occupational
specialty (MOS) education. From 1975 to 2007, it produced a total of 276,000
nationally certified technical experts--such as industrial and functional
specialists--from 120 fields including mechanics, chemicals, electricity and
electronics. In addition, it produces 54,000 technical personnel every year in
various fields such as communications, aviation, maintenance, etc.

(2) Planned Programs by Area
Force Improvement focuses on establishing core capacities to actively cope
with future various threats, while consolidating deterrence capabilities against
the North. It also seeks to invigorate defense R&D to upgrade the ability to
develop weapons systems and to provide an engine for new growth in the
national economy.
Operation and Maintenance is allocated to “set the conditions to maximize
combat capabilities of existing forces”and “establish an advanced military
welfare system.”First, by reflecting maintenance costs of newly fielded
equipment, it guarantees normal operating conditions for the K-9 selfpropelled artillery, the Gwanggaeto III-class destroyer (Aegis), the F-15K, etc.
Second, it extends the groundwork to foster an elite reserve force by
establishing new Reserve Force Mobilization Centers and compensation
system for training. Third, it plans to complete modernization of barracks
during the target period and to gradually install a hazardous area
compensation system. Fourth, it reflects demands to improve medical
services in divisions and units below.

Section 2 Defense Management as a New Economic Growth Engine

C. Direction of the 2010-2014 Mid-term Defense Plan
The 2010-2014 Mid-term Defense Plan will be established to reflect the
results of the mid-term assessment and a reevaluation of required budget
projection of the Defense Reform Basic Plan. The plan seeks to actively
support the government’s agenda by assuring necessary elements to advance
the military structure, setting positive conditions for existing forces, and
completing barrack modernizations early.


3. Efforts to Efficiently Operate Defense Budget

MND is continuing its effort not only to foster an advanced elite military by
efficiently managing its budget, but also to contribute to the national
economy.
The Ministry is seeking to maximize efficiency in formulating the defense
budget, as it formulates the Mid-term Defense Plan and its annual budget. In
the meantime, it has eliminated inefficiencies such as decreasing repair item
supplies and changing the standard in size of facilities, while introducing a
rational basis for budget allocations. It has also achieved a 500 billion won
cost-cut by partnering with finance authorities to verify the plans in parallel
with drafting the 2008-2012 Mid-term Defense Plan. Details are shown in
Table 8-7.

4. Defense Industry as an Engine for New Economic
Growth

MND is promoting the “making of the defense industry into a new
economic growth engine”as one of its national tasks in order to allow
defense industries to become fresh catalysts for development of the national
economy.
The Ministry has contributed
immensely to the national economy
through transfer of defense science
technologies to the private sector as
well as through defense industry
exports. By 2007, it transferred 102
outstanding defense technologies to

Section 2 Defense Management as a New Economic Growth Engine

A. Expanding Basis for Growth by Invigorating Defense R&D
It is important to upgrade the quality of defense science technology in
order to equip defense industries with international competitiveness and
contribute to development of the national economy.
To achieve this, MND plans to place more weight on defense R&D by
elevating the scale to 7 percent of the defense budget by 2012. It will also
encourage an open R&D structure such as joint efforts among industries,
academia, and the research sector, and a system that facilitates transfer of
defense technologies to the private sector. By reinforcing international
cooperation of defense science technology, it will broaden the foundation
for the growth of defense industries.


B. Improving Operational Conditions for Defense Industries
Defense industry requires a mid to long-term investment at the nationallevel. Not only is it a capital-intensive industry that necessitates a
considerable size of infrastructure investment, but also an industry of limited
market and demand, with the government being its only source of demand.
Considering such circumstances, the Ministry is fostering policies to
improve operating conditions for defense industries.
First, it will reinforce financial aid to foster the industry. Second, it will offer
a system that encourages self-initiated management innovation by rewarding
efforts that rationalize management and costs at the contract signing stage.
Third, it will seek to increase the proportion of domestic parts in weapons
systems. In 2008, it introduced the Master Plan for Domestic Production as
groundwork to systematically continue to produce parts domestically.
Furthermore, the Ministry will develop policies to support development
funds, in order to encourage domestic production of core parts.

C. Establishing a Government-led Defense Industry Export
Support System
Unlike exports in the private sector, defense exports often necessitate
government guarantees for stable supply of subsequent parts and technical


213


-----

Chapter 8 Pragmatic Defense Management System

support, as well as government-led marketing efforts. In particular, largerscale defense industry export requires government support efforts, as buyer
nations increasingly request for demands such as industrial cooperation and
local investment.
The Ministry seeks to diversify its markets by establishing export strategies
that differentiate among nations. By organizing a “defense industry export
task force”consisting of acquisition and export specialists, it plans to provide
customized export support services. Moreover, by operating the Export
Support Council for Defense Industries with participation by related
agencies, the Ministry will coordinate immediate tasks that include reviewing
buyer state’s desired terms and counter-purchase.
MND has increased international defense industry cooperation agreements
as shown in Table 8-9.

5. Reinforcing Defense Science and Technology


A. Status of Defense Science and Technology
Korea’s defense science and technology has achieved much under the
Agency for Defense Development (ADD)’s leadership, but still has not
reached the level of developed nations. Korea still relies on foreign nations
for core technologies of main weapon systems, while capacities to

B. Visions and Objectives for Defense Science and Technology
The Ministry’s way forward in the field of defense science and technology
is to secure world-class technologies. Its mid-term objective for policies
promoting defense science and technology is to advance the development of
advanced weapon systems to the level of the world’s leading countries[18)] and
its long-term goal is to secure capacities to indigenously develop such
weapon systems.

C. Direction for Policies to Promote Defense Science and
Technology
Direction for policies to promote defense science and technology is as
follows:
First, increase investments in defense science and technology and promote
efficiency in the defense R&D system. MND plans to give more weight to


18)“Advancing to the level
of the world’s leading countries”means possessing the
defense science and technology at the level of the
world’s eight leading countries.

Chapter 8 Pragmatic Defense Management System

defense R&D and elevate its ratio to the budget to that of the developed
nations standard of 7 percent by 2012. Investment in force improvement will
be separated into two--acquisition costs for major military equipment and
defense R&D--with priority assigned to the latter. A yearly investment plan
for defense R&D until 2012 is shown in Table 8-10.


Table 8-10. Yearly Investment Plan for Defense R&D

※2009 numbers are from a finalized budget, and numbers for 2010 and after 2010 are derived from the Mid-term Defense Plan


Dividing domains of R&D projects allows ADD to concentrate on core
technologies and advanced force capabilities, and enables defense industries
to focus on general force improvement. Moreover, by establishing a
planning and assessment system for defense science and technology, MND
improves evaluation of R&D efforts.
Second, strive for a goal-oriented defense R&D. In other words,
concentrate on core technologies applied to future weapons systems and
technologies to improve efficiency of existing weapon systems. To achieve
this, the Ministry should identify and concentrate its investments on core
technologies for weapon systems to be operated in an effect-based network
centric warfare (NCW) such as system of systems, strategic weapons, unmanned combat systems, etc. Efforts to develop technologies that improve
the quality of existing weapon systems while minimizing costs should be
made as well.
Third, revitalize an open R&D structure. Foremost, this implies
improvement of the defense science and technology in connection with the
National Science Technology Basic Plan. By breaking away from the
reclusive R&D structure with defense research organizations as its core, MND
should improve exchange with the private sector. The Ministry should also


216


-----

Section 2 Defense Management as a New Economic Growth Engine

expand participation of industries, academia, and the research sector in the
R&D process and invigorate transfer of defense science and technology to
the private sector. Furthermore, it should expand development of dual use
(civil and military) technology[19)] which allows sharing between the private 19) Dual Use (Civil and

Section3.

Defense Informatization for the Future


As a reflection on changes in information and communications technologies, MND is

facilitating an environment for network-centric defense informatization that enables it to

effectively respond to future warfare.

It is also improving defense informatization strategies in line with the national defense

policy, and reinforcing the infrastructure for information sharing and assurance. The Ministry

supports a low-cost, high-efficiency defense management and seeks to achieve qualitative

transformation of military forces through advancement of warfighting and business process

information systems. Moreover, it looks to expand the information and communications

infrastructure in order to seamlessly run the defense information systems.

1. Shaping a Network-centric Informatization
Environment


A. Direction for Advancing Defense Informatization
Defense is an area with the highest need for application of advanced
information and communications systems.
Therefore, the Ministry is reinforcing defense informatization in line with
national informatization policies. It takes the lead in applying new civil
technologies to the defense sector via cooperative projects with the Ministry
of Knowledge and Economy (MKE). Such projects are a strategic model that
creates a positive value chain between the defense and civilian sectors, thus
contributing to their mutual development. For the defense sector, it enables
low-cost, high-efficiency defense management as well as upgrade in defense


219


-----

Chapter 8 Pragmatic Defense Management System

capacities. For the civil sector, its competitiveness can be improved by
securing early demands for their new information and communications
technology.
The Ministry has constructed a defense Enterprise Architecture (EA) in
order to improve defense enterprise and to carry out informatization projects
more effectively. The architecture was established and applied first in the
MND in 2007, the JCS in 2008, then to Army/Navy/Air Force headquarters in
2009. Through the defense EA, MND is improving its business process from
an organization-based to a function-based one, which is used as a tool for
renovation and improvement of business processes. The Ministry will seek to
promote informatization return-on-investments by establishing a basis to
systematically plan, execute, and evaluate information system projects.
The Ministry plans to publish a Defense Informationization Policy Paper in
2009, which offers comprehensive directions for advancing defense
informatization.


Cooperative Projects between MND and
MKE to Realize u-Defense

MND and MKE established a Defense Informatization Cooperation

Plan in 2006 and have carried out their cooperative projects. The

plan includes applying new information and communications

technologies in which Korea has an international competitiveness, to

the defense sector. Such technologies include RFID, Ubiquitous

Sensor Network (USN), and Wireless Broadband (WiBro). In order to

apply the new technologies, the Ministry has identified a test unit and

began to introduce a USN-based unmanned surveillance system, a

multi-pod robot, an RFID-based integrated logistics management

system, etc. for a trial run.

The two Ministries continue to develop such cooperative projects

into a cooperative governance model in which both the defense and

civil sectors can make progress.

Section 3 Defense Informatization for the Future

B. Assuring Conditions for Information-sharing
MND sets the standards for weapons and non-weapons that require
interoperability between systems. The Ministry assures the conditions for
information-sharing by establishing an interoperability evaluation and
certification system.
MND has reinforced an institutional and organizational basis to improve
interoperability between systems. In November 2007, the Ministry enacted
the Directive on Management of Defense Interoperability, and modified the
Defense Information Technical Architecture (DITA) for application across the
acquisition stages as the main standard. In August 2007, the Ministry
established a Joint Interoperability Technology Center as an exclusive agency
in charge of constructing infrastructure for interoperability and performing
technical tests and feasibility reviews.
MND has established a technical basis to improve interoperability between
systems as well. The Ministry constructed an information system to manage
Common Operating Environment (COE) and Shared Data Environment
(SHADE). COE is a set of standards which enables re-use of developed
softwares. SHADE is a set of standards for data expressions to improve
interoperability.
The Ministry is improving interoperability between systems by
strengthening interconnectivity among systems. For example, the battlefield
management information system will be linked to the Korean Joint
Command & Control System (KJCCS), while the resource management
information system will be linked primarily to the finance and logistics
information system. Accordingly, the Ministry is identifying specific interface
requirements to reinforce the overall interconnectivity. In 2007 it identified
approximately 60 tasks, and continues updating via the creation of an
information exchange list.
Moreover, the Ministry established a Levels of Information System
Interoperability (LISI) model in order to evaluate and certify system
interoperability.
Once such information sharing conditions are established, overall cost will

Chapter 8 Pragmatic Defense Management System

be reduced as the system development time will be curtailed and
interoperability improved.


C. Strengthening Information Assurance
MND is strengthening its information assurance in order to maximize its
wartime and peacetime mission accomplishment from the ever more
malignant and intelligent cyber threats.
The Ministry is reinforcing related regulations and its organizations to be
able to swiftly respond to defense cyber threats. In 2007, it modified
Information Operations Condition (INFOCON) Regulations and the manual
on specific measures and responses in cases of a defense cyber threat. In
January 2008, it enacted the National Defense Directive on the Assurance of
Biometric Information.[21)] In March 2008, the Information Assurance Planning
Division was formed in MND Headquarters, in an effort to strengthen
organizations dedicated to information assurance. Furthermore, by tasking
Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERT) to corps and units above, the
Ministry established a comprehensive and systematic assurance system that
controls defense information systems on a 24 hour basis.
In order to assure impenetrability,
the Ministry introduced and applied
advanced technologies to information assurance systems. It increased
the installment of a certification
function in information systems to be
able to control access to systems and Cyber defense competition
important data. Furthermore, to
minimize damages from hacking and virus attacks, it has installed a virus
blocking software to all PCs connected to the network, and prevented
network access to unauthorized PCs. The Ministry has installed firewalls and
integrated security control systems in the server and the network
management system in order to detect and prevent violations. In addition,
MND has implemented an automated diagnosis system to protect individual


21) Biometric Information
As a type of personal
information, it refers to
information on physical or
behavioral characteristics to
identify an individual. Examples are fingerprints, face
shape, irises, cornea, vein,
voice, etc.

information and to periodically assess its status.
Through such efforts on information assurance, the Ministry was selected
as an exemplary institution in the 2007 National Institution and Public
Agency Information Assurance Inspection.


2. Advancing Information System and Infrastructure

A. Battlefield Management Information System
The battlefield management information system is essential for real-time
sharing of battlefield conditions and support of command decisions.
The battlefield management information system can be divided into
Command, Control, Communication, Computer & Intelligence (C4I) System
and military information system. C4I System can be further dissected into
joint strategy C4I system, combined C4I system, Army/Navy/Air Force tactical
C4I system and combat command system. Details are shown in Table 8-11.


Table 8-11. Battlefield Management Information System

|Area|Col2|Systems|
|---|---|---|
|C4I Sys- tems|Joint Strategic C4I System|Korean Joint Command & Control System (KJCCS)|

||Combat Command System|Battalion Tactical Command System (BTCS) Korea Naval Tactical Data System (KNTDS) Master Control & Reporting Center (MCRC)|
|Military Information System||Military Information Management System (MIMS)|



As a joint strategic C4I system, the Korean Joint Command & Control System
(KJCCS) was developed and deployed in 2007.


223


-----

Chapter 8 Pragmatic Defense Management System

After the wartime operational control (OPCON) transition, a system for
combined operations will be developed by 2011 for the ROK to take
initiative in the ROK-U.S. combined C4I system.
As for the tactical C4I system for the ground forces, ATCIS has been fielded
to Army corps and Marine Corps by 2008, and its first stage quality
improvement will continue until 2010. In developing KNCCS, the Navy
worked on improving primarily its intelligence and operations-related
functions until 2007. And since 2008 the Navy has been focusing on
improving its capabilities and gaining additional forces. The Air Force has
improved AFCCS to interface with the aviation and resource information
system, and allow dissemination of Air Tasking Order (ATO) to squadrons by
2008. The Air Force will focus on improving its capabilities starting in 2009.
For the Military Information Management System (MIMS), the Ministry will
promote data standardization and establish integrated database by 2010 in
order to support comprehensive military information.


B. Resource Management Information System
The resource management information system can be divided into four
functional areas: planning and budget; logistics and facilities; human
resources and mobilization; and lastly, electronic administration.
The Ministry is improving the efficiency of the resource management
information system by integrating and fortifying the linkage with the finance
and logistics information system. Also by linking the national finance
information to that of defense, it is establishing a competitive defense
management system.
Information systems for each functional area have been built and managed
according to Information Systems’Master Plan in Conditions with Defense
EA and Business Process Reengineering/Information Strategy Planning
(BPR/ISP). It is thus made possible to specify goals for each information
system project and evaluate their performances.

C. Information and Communications Infrastructure
Information and communications infrastructure is a set of computers and
network related components that support production, processing,
management, and dissemination of information necessary for warfighting
and business process management. A diagram of operational concepts of the
information and communications infrastructure is shown in Figure 8-10.

Chapter 8 Pragmatic Defense Management System

The Ministry is continuously establishing a reliable, broadband network
infrastructure. It plans to establish a high-speed and high-capacity defense
broadband convergence network by 2009 via private investment projects
(BTL). This will significantly improve each echelon’s bandwidth by up to
10Gbps. The defense broadband convergence network will be an Internet
Protocol (IP)-based network, allowing for an effective network management.
For tactical network, the Ministry has operated a dual-use (civil and military)
satellite system since 2007. Furthermore, the Ministry is developing a Tactical
Information and Communications Network (TICN) and a Joint Tactical Data
Link System (JTDLS), which offer real-time broadband communications.


Military Satellite Communications System

The military satellite communications system is a
system utilizing commercial
and military satellites for
military purposes. It consists
of a satellite, satellite operation system, and ground
terminal equipment. It can

diameter of 11,000km, a wide area starting from the Marshal Islands in the
Pacific (East) to the Straits of Malacca (West), and from Northern Australia
(South) to Lake Baikal (North).

One of the achievements of the satellite communications system
development is that it established an Army/Navy/Air Force integrated C4I
network. The ROK military is now able to perform operations efficiently via
integration and real-time sharing of battlefield information.


226


-----

Section 3 Defense Informatization for the Future

By 2010, the Ministry plans to supply one PC per staff, as the network
infrastructure allows even the smaller-sized units to utilize a reliable
broadband information communications service. Also, in order to improve
information processing ability and application services, it will upgrade the
servers and appropriately install high-capacity storage devices.
Open source software technology is being actively introduced in the area
of operating servers and PCs. Common software such as word processors
can be used by obtaining an all-military site license.
From this point forward, the Ministry seeks to establish a stable and ecofriendly informatization environment that can improve server performance
while reducing power consumption.


D. Modeling & Simulation System
Defense modeling and simulation (M&S) system is classified into training,
analysis, and acquisition, according to application objectives. It is used to
support policymaking related to force building and operation, assist decisionmaking through scientific verifications, and handle combat experimentation.
For M&S system on training, the Ministry focuses on developing various
models to provide a futuristic synthetic battlefield environment. The ROK
military operates Taeguk Joint Operation Simulation (JOS) model for joint
exercises, Changjo 21 model for corps/division-level ground training, and
Navy’s Cheonghae Model. Air Force’s Changgong Model and Marine Corps’
Cheonjabong Model are still being developed.
The analytical models are used for concept development, force analysis,
and formulating OPLAN. The acquisition models are used for confirming
requirements, R&D, and test & evaluation.

3. Development of Defense Informatization for the
Future


A. Promoting Informatization in Line with National and
Defense Policies
The Ministry has been exerting efforts to strengthen the link between
defense informatization and national informatization policies. Since 2006, it
has executed a cooperative project with MKE to experiment new
technologies in the defense sector. Furthermore, it is continuing its
government-wide cooperation via the subcommittee of the Informatization
Promotion Committee, which was reorganized in 2007.
Defense informatization is a means to materialize defense policies
effectively. Therefore, the Ministry will link defense informatization with
major defense policies such as the Defense Reform Basic Plan, etc.
Meanwhile, the Ministry is reinforcing international cooperation. In
February 2008, it agreed with its U.S. counterpart to annually hold the ROKU.S. Information Communication Technology (ICT) Forum.[22)] Through such
venues, cooperation in areas of mutual interests such as information
assurance and M&S, etc. will be reinforced.

B. Performance-based Management and Improving the
Quality of Services
MND will strengthen its coordination and control function on defense
informatization and establish a performance-based management. It will
develop evaluation models and improve inspection as well as follow-up
measures in order to improve objectivity and fairness.
MND is establishing the Defense Consolidated Data Center in order to
upgrade the defense informatization services for Army/Navy/Air Force users.
By 2007, it consolidated computer centers scattered across echelons into 77
centers and plans to integrate them into an all-military serving Defense
Consolidated Data Center by 2012. It is developing specific plans to optimize
facilities and operating environment based on the basic plan established in


22) The ROK-U.S. Information Communication
Technology (ICT) Forum:
A forum to cooperate on
information communication
technology such as NCW
and next-generation communications. It was launched
in February 2008, and its first
forum took place in Washington DC in September of
the same year.

Section 3 Defense Informatization for the Future

2008. The Defense Consolidated Data Center will improve survivability of
defense information systems during wartime and peacetime, while increasing
the quality of data processing and user satisfaction.


C. Improving the System
MND established the Guidelines for Project Management of Defense
Information System in March 2008. The guidelines represent standardization
of defense informatization management systems that had been scattered into
several guidances and regulations. This is meaningful in a way that it
allowed for the standardization of project management by defense
information system managers as well as timely application of new
technologies.
The Ministry plans to introduce a new legislation to accelerate defense
informatization on warfighting and business process management and to
improve the projects’efficiency as well as effectiveness.

Section1.

Defense Manpower Management


The ROK Ministry of National Defense (MND) strives to establish a higher quality

military welfare system for service members in order to encourage the willingness to

serve his or her country and improve service morale.

It has established a legal basis through the enactment of the Framework Act on Military

Personnel Welfare and is formulating the Military Personnel Welfare Basic Plan via a

comprehensive surveying of actual conditions. It also built the Armed Forces Welfare

Agency by consolidating welfare related groups dispersed across the Services, thereby

creating a framework for a systematic promotion of welfare policies.

1. Enactment of the Framework Act on Military
Personnel Welfare


The Framework Act on Military Personnel Welfare was enacted in March
2008. This will be an opportunity to improve service member quality of life
as well as overall military welfare. The enactment is expected to significantly
improve the likes of housing, children education, and medical services
which had been tepid due to the lack of legal basis. An overview of the
Framework Act on Military Personnel Welfare is shown in Figure 9-1.

- Housing: Prioritize provision of housing for non-home owning officers

and NCOs who served over 10 years

-  Prioritize supply of public housing sites to those building houses for

non-home owning officers and NCOs.

-  Sell base property assets for building new housing facilities when

relocating bases.

※ Guarantee a prioritized provision of housing sites for non-home

owning officers and NCOs to the Military Mutual Aid Association.

- Childcare: Support construction of national/public childcare centers in

areas with dense military population

- Education: Support children’s transfer/admission to schools and

provide dormitories if necessary



- Medical Service: Provide regular medical check ups, medical support,

and outsource medical care

- Welfare Facility: Streamline management/operation and open facilities

to the public

2. Surveying the Conditions of Welfare for Military
Personnel and Establishing the Basic Plan


MND is surveying the status of military personnel welfare for the first time
in history in accordance with the Framework Act on Military Personnel
Welfare, and thereby establishing the Military Personnel Welfare Basic Plan.
Since examination on the conditions of military personnel welfare had
been conducted rather ad hoc by disparate defense-related agencies, such a
consolidated examination and research effort to date was unprecedented. In
such light, the research on military welfare conducted in 2008 will generate
persuasive statistics on the welfare status. It will also enable establishment
and implementation of a comprehensive development plan for military
personnel welfare based on scientific and objective indicators.


233

Chapter 9 Improvement of Quality of Life

MND plans to continue to systematically promote stable living conditions
and an improved quality of life based on the Military Personnel Welfare
Basic Plan for service members.


3. Establishment of the Armed Forces Welfare
Agency

The Ministry established the Armed
Forces Welfare Agency in September 2008
by consolidating welfare groups operated
separately by each Service. The consolidation eliminated inefficiencies caused by
redundant facility investments and imbalance in welfare benefits across Services, Activation ceremony for the ArmedForces Welfare Agency
thereby offering a low-cost and highly- (MND, September 1, 2008)
efficient welfare system.
The Armed Forces Welfare Agency plans to improve the management
system so that each Service can commonly use welfare facilities scattered
across the nation. Responding to user demands and social changes, the
Agency also plans to build “welfare towns”in respective clusters, where
users can comply with their sight-seeing, sports, and lodging needs all at
once.

Section 2 Improving Working and Living Conditions

Section2.

Improving Working and Living Conditions


MND promotes welfare improvement policies of which the effects can be directly felt by

individual service members. The policies are as follows: adopting a remuneration system

reflecting the peculiar characteristics of military service; improving provision of service

member’s necessities; and upgrading the quality of clothing and outfit. In addition,

facilities, housing conditions, and welfare service for families are consistently being

ameliorated.

1. Improving Soldier Remuneration and Related
Systems


MND is revising the Military Personnel
Remuneration Act so that it can develop a
remuneration system that realistically
reflects the characteristics of military
service.
By reflecting unique challenges experi

Remuneration Act, the Ministry seeks to maintain its own particular
remuneration system.
MND plans to establish allowances to reflect the uniqueness of military
missions and the expertise involved, while also improving the system to


235


-----

Chapter 9 Improvement of Quality of Life

reflect individual circumstances and hazards. To improve the current poor
conditions, the Ministry will provide various compensations such as service
member allowance, an allowance compensating separation of families, and
financial support for college students in the family. It also plans to include
daytime/nighttime duty allowances as well as specific duty payments for
different positions (for the lieutenant colonel level) within operating costs.
Furthermore, MND will introduce special duty remuneration such as
allowances for servicing in close contact and special areas and for
ship/air/hazardous duties.
Meanwhile, salary payment for enlisted service members increased by 10
percent in 2008, with corporals being paid 88,000 won a month. Salary
payment is expected to further increase to 100,000 won that will significantly
cover the necessary expenses for daily livelihoods in the barracks.
Measures to indirectly improve conditions for active-duty personnel are
being reviewed as well. Such measures include: exempting mandatory
servicemen on their parent’s composite income tax; expanding a “system of
maximum fare for coastal passengers,”which is currently offered only to
island inhabitants; deferring interest payments for students enlisted while on
financial aid; and duty-free benefits in welfare clubs.


2. Supply of Necessities, Clothing and Outfit

MND is increasing its annual employment of civilian nutritionists in order
to facilitate different appetites and improve satisfaction of meal plans. Table
9-1 shows employment status of civilian nutritionists.

The Ministry also plans to increase the basic costs
of meal plans for service members to allow a
sufficient nutritional intake, marking a change from
focusing on quantity to quality. It plans to increase
the cost to that of 90 percent of the level for civilians.
Plans to increase basic costs for service members’

In accordance with the Mid-term Improvement Plan for Clothing and
Outfit, the Ministry first improved several essential items such as summertime
BDUs, combat helmets, special operations gear, sporting outfit, and
innerwear. It also supplied new items in 2008 such as knapsacks for track
vehicles and outdoor gripsacks. Furthermore, it plans to annually supply
helmet attachments, winter clothing, individual tents, combat knapsacks,
combat boots, etc. appropriately fitted for carrying out military missions. The
Mid-term Improvement Plan for Clothing and Outfit is shown in Table 9-3.

3. Military Facilities and Living Conditions


Responding to societal developments such as increased standard of living
and social consciousness, MND seeks to gradually renovate old and cramped
barracks as well as officer quarters.
MND improved barracks to a higher level in an effort to minimize the
qualitative discrepancies between the military quarters and the environment
of which individual service members grew up in. It increased the floor
spaces per individual service member from 2.3㎡to 6.3㎡, and restructured
platoon sized non-bed barracks into a bed-filled accommodation for squad
sized elements. The Ministry is also increasing convenient facilities such as
cyber knowledge information rooms (computer clusters), fitness centers, and

them, 20,500 houses will be renovated by
2012 via Build-Transfer-Lease (BTL) contracts,
while the rest will be renovated as part of
financed projects by 2013. Air Force quarters built via BTL
A considerable number of bachelor officer’s
quarters are over 25 years old. Furthermore, only 51 percent of total required
quarters are provided for, thereby having 2-3 occupants sharing a single
quarter. By taking into consideration the expected increase in junior officers
following military force re-structuring, the Ministry plans to focus their
investment until 2012 in order to renovate old quarters and build new ones
so that it can accommodate one officer per quarter.

4. Improving Living Conditions for Military Families


Military families face various challenges
as they are stationed far from cities and
usually subject to frequent moves. To
accommodate such difficulties, MND is
exerting efforts to improve living conditions for military families. In October 2008,
the Ministry signed a Business Agreement Agreement-signing between MND andMIHWAF (October 21, 2008)
on Providing Professional Support Services
to Military Families[2)] with the Ministry for Health, Welfare, and Family Affairs
(MIHWAF).

A. Supporting Education for Children of Military Families
Career soldiers face challenges in educating their children as they are
stationed in remote locations, make frequent moves, and often live apart
from families. To accommodate these difficulties, MND is expanding
dormitory facilities and increasing benefits under special admission for
college.
The Ministry operates twelve dormitories
(capacity of 2,000) in ten cities across the
nation. It will build a facility in Seoul that
holds 300 persons in 2009. Furthermore, it
plans to additionally secure a 1,200
capacity dormitory by replacing the current
Songpa Institute with a military dormitory. families

Dormitory for children of military
families

A total of 835 sons and daughters of military personnel entered college
with the benefit of special admission for college between 2007 and 2008, 416
students in 75 colleges in 2007 and 419 students in 77 colleges in 2008. The
Ministry annually holds college fairs for students and parents of military
families, and uploads related information onto its websites. It also plans to
increase the number of universities providing benefits to 80 institutions in

order to allow more students to receive such benefits in 2009.
MND has been offering Defense Scholarships (Hoguk Scholarship) since
1993 to ratchet up career soldiers’morale in challenging conditions. In 2007,
it offered 1,000,000 won to 5,163 freshmen and 500,000 won to 9,329
upperclassmen. It plans to increase scholarship for freshmen to 1,500,000
won in 2009, then to 3,000,000 won. Moreover, the Ministry is considering
making provisions for different scholarships for high-score achievers as well
as benefits for engineering students in conformity with the government’s
policy.


B. Welfare Support for Multiple-Children Families
To comply with the government’s policy, MND has been implementing
policies to promote childbirth[3)] in accordance with the MND Guidelines for
Incentives to Promote Childbirth. As a result, the Ministry was chosen in
March 2007 by the “Presidential Commission on Low Childbirth and Aging
Society”as an exemplary institution for creating a workplace that encourages
childbirth.
MND modified the Veterans’Pension Act in order to include the days
absent from the workplace due to maternity/childcare leave into total days of
active service when calculating retirement allowances. It also revised the
Military Personnel Act and the Public Officials Remuneration Regulations to
provide allowances for substitutes who come in for those on maternity leave.
Furthermore, the Ministry seeks to expand welfare services by establishing
childcare facilities for military families.

C. Recreation and Welfare Facilities
MND plans to manage 2,690 accounts for nine central recreation facilities
(military-owned) and civilian condominiums to strike a balance between
work and rest for service members. It plans to expand the number of
procured facilities to areas preferred by soldiers and families.
The Ministry operates 32 golf courses to maintain service members’
vigilance as well as offer opportunities for leisure and fitness. It is currently

size of stationing units, the number of veterans nearby, and unit relocation
plans.
The Ministry plans to package welfare clubs, condos & recreation facilities,
and golf courses together to allow for rest and recreation at a single
destination. Through such initiatives, it will improve efficiency in welfare
facility management as well as satisfy service members’increased demands
for recreation caused both by the spread of culture that values leisure,
individual well-being, and a five-day work week.

Designing an Advanced Medical Support System


MND is developing a military medical support system to improve combat capacities by

promoting service members’ health. By establishing the Mid- and Long-term Master Plan

for the Development of Military Medical Affairs, it is exerting efforts to improve medical

facilities and equipment, and secure talented medical personnel.

1. Establishment of Mid-and Long-term Master Plan
for the Development of Military Medical Affairs


MND had established Promotion Programs for the Development of Military
Medical Affairs in 2006 by forming a government-level committee to improve
the military medical support system. From such initiatives, it established Midand Long-term Master Plan for the Development of Military Medical Affairs in
July 2008, by reinforcing tasks that failed to reflect the reality of and
consensus by each Service. The effort presented a mid/long-term roadmap
for improving military medical affairs and it is currently focusing on 18
specific tasks in eight areas.[5)]

2. Major Agendas


5) Programs Promoted to
Achieve Development in
Military Medical Affairs
(1) Provide patient-based

For medical equipment, 37 essential items
including digital X-ray and blood testing kits were upgraded while high-tech
apparatus such as seven magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) units and five
computed tomography (CT) were added to significantly reduce patients’
waiting time. Three division-level medical facilities were constructed or
modified in connection with barrack modernization plans in order to fortify
primary treatment centers at the division level or lower. Furthermore,
Hampyeong Hospital (May 2007) and Pohang Hospital (March 2008) were
opened, and 108 expert medical non-commissioned officers including firstaid personnel, nurses, and various medical staff were employed in 2008.
MND is improving the personnel
management system in order to secure
talented medical personnel and medical
non-commissioned officers. The Ministry is
improving the remuneration system and
working conditions to attract competent
medical officers. It is also hiring civilian Contracted doctors providing medical
doctors to upgrade the quality of overall care (Armed Forces Capital Hospital)

medical treatment. For the first time, five civilian doctors were employed in
the Armed Forces Capital Hospital in May 2008. The groundwork for
contracting civilian doctors to military hospital was laid in February 2008
when an agreement was signed between the Ministry and Seoul National
University Hospital.
In the meantime, the Ministry is restructuring the organizations related to
military medical affairs and is entrusting treatment to civilian hospitals. In
order to upgrade its level of medical services, it modified 20 hospitals into 15,
and in July 2008 it transferred command of Seoul District Hospital from the
MND to Military Medical Command. Moreover, it signed service agreements
with 69 civilian hospitals in order to care and examine patients who require
treatments exceeding capabilities of military hospitals.


6) Area-based Medical
Treatment Closing System
A medical system to minimize evacuation of patients
and complete treatment in
corps-level areas.

7) Concentrated Hospital
A hospital that offers general
hospital-level treatment and
medical service across the
military. Examples include
Capital, Daejon, Yangju,
Daegu, and Hampyeong
Hospitals.


3. Future Plans

MND plans to continuously reinforce 25 division-level medical facilities and
substitute 964 old ambulances by increasing the ratio of civilian ambulances
in order to guarantee rapid transport. It also plans to secure 1,051 expert
medical non-commissioned officers by 2013.
The military will offer area-based medical treatment closing system[6)]

according to the patient’s conditions by dividing military hospitals into
“concentrated hospitals,”[7)]“mobile support hospitals,”[8)] and “outpatient
hospitals.”[9)] It will also achieve unity of command by placing Pohang
Hospital and Maritime Medical Clinic under the Military Medical Command.
The Ministry plans to reinforce Comprehensive Development Plan for the
Armed Forces Capital Hospital and establish the National Defense Institute
for Medical Science - the military’s supreme tertiary medical institution.
Through such efforts, it will establish the Defense Medical School to cultivate
military medical personnel and to operate a hospital with a 1,000-bed
capacity. Moreover, it will establish research functions in military-specific
categories.[10)]


8) Mobile Support Hospital
A hospital with mobile
medical support capacities
for supporting units during
wartime that has basic
surgery capabilities. Examples include Byeokje, Ildong,
Chuncheon, Gangneung,
Cheoljeong Hospitals in front
area, and Pohang & Jinhae
Hospitals in rear area.

9) Outpatient Hospitals or
Centers
Their primary mission is to
offer outpatient care to
military personnel in their
area. They keep minimal
beds. Examples include
Wonju, Cheongpyeong,
Haeuiwon, Pohang, and
Seoul District Hospitals.


10) Military-Specific Categories
They include bullet wounds,
burns, and NBC treatment.

percent of the participants expressing satisfaction of the program. Thereby in
2008, the Ministry increased the number of participants to 250 and expanded
the program to the Daegu and Gwangju area. Also, the three-month period
for consulting was extended to four months.


B. Reinforcing Basic Education on Employment
MND is reinforcing its basic employment education for retiring officers in
order to minimize their anxieties about the
future and enable a smooth transition into
society. Basic employment education is
offered to retiring officers and NCOs
stationed in forward remote locations by
touring across units. Participants learn
about the private industry and ways to Employment education tour to front

Section5.

Stable Management of Military Pension System


The military pension system reflects distinctive characteristics of military service,

exhibiting a strong sense of remuneration from the nation.

MND has unilaterally managed the military pension system since 1963 and continues

to safely manage the fund by revising the Veterans’ Pension Act.

1. Characteristics of Military Pension System


The military pension system was first managed as part of the Public
Officials Pension Act (enacted in January 1960). In 1963, considering the
uniqueness of serving in the military, the Veterans’Pension Act was
separated from the Public Officials Pension Act and has been managed since
then.
Military pension system has the purpose of contributing to a standard of
decent living and well-being for its beneficiaries by providing an appropriate
amount of pay to service members and families upon honorable retirement,
retirement or death due to physical/psychological impediments, or medical
leave of absence for illness/injury sustained in line of duty. It is a pension
system not only with elements of social insurance and guaranteeing
livelihood, but also with a feel of national compensation attached to it.
The reason for the strong sense of national compensation to military
pensions is that service members are required to perform missions during
crisis in order to protect the nation as well as the lives and properties of its
people. Service member’s private lives are limited by regular upkeep of alert


254

Section 5 Stable Management of Military Pension System

status, trainings, and frequent relocations, and they retire early at ages when
expenditures are at an all-time high (between 45-55) irrespective of personal
intensions based on a system of placing a ceiling on age. Upon retirement,
they face employment challenges as military expertise gathered during
service is difficult to translate into the society. Military pension system reflects
such characteristics of military service.
To note, military authorities from other developed nations also self-manage
military pension by separating them from public service pension and
national pension.
In major developed nations, military pension is given preferential treatment
over other pensions in terms of the following: Minimum service years for
pension receipt; supply commencement age; rate of contribution to pension;
level of pension paid; and period of contribution payment. Rate of
contribution to military pension by major nations are shown in Table 9-6.


Table 9-6. Rate of Contribution to Pension for the ROK and Other Nations

|Contributed Entirely by Nation|Individual Contribution < Nation’s Contribution|Individual Contribution = Nation’s Contribution|
|---|---|---|
|U.S., UK, Germany, etc.|Canada, Italy, etc.|ROK, Japan, Argentina, etc.|



2. Efforts to Stabilize Financing


The government is currently amending the shortages in military pension
caused in the early days of the system when the number of recipients
increased without the military having secured sufficient funds. The reason
behind such increase was the military paying out pension while exempting
fund contributions for services rendered before 1959 and for the three times
during the period of war including the Korean War and the Vietnam War.
MND has been modifying the Veterans’Pension Act in order to establish
systemic measures to stabilize military pension finance. It will soon present
measures reflecting the uniqueness of the military after gathering suggestions


255


-----

Chapter 9 Improvement of Quality of Life

from financial experts and interested parties.
Shareholders and the government have been increasing their share of
liabilities from 3.5 percent to 8.5 percent per their monthly income. Starting
January 2001, the Ministry stipulated that method of pension increase not be
necessarily correlated with recipient’s income but with changes in consumer
price index, to estimate pension based on average income of the last three
years rather than final income, and to allow even the legal reserve--required
for stability in pension financing--to be financed through accumulation.
Starting January 2007, with pension being paid out from the legal reserve, the
Ministry was to reflect this in their supplied fund two years later to have it
financed again through accumulation. Furthermore, starting November 2006,
if a pension recipient is determined to have a non-pension income above a
certain level, the Ministry can stem portions of their pension payment.
Pension recipients per year are shown in Figure 9-7.

In the meantime, the Ministry plans to use “the system for integrating

who had been ineligible as they failed to satisfy the 19 years and six months
of required service.

Starting May 2006, MND is offering related services on the Internet
(http://www.mps.go.kr) for pension recipients through the Military Pension
Information System. By making various documents[17)] such as “a letter to

Section1.

Cultivating an Advanced Barracks Culture


The ROK Ministry of National Defense (MND) is establishing a foundation to cultivate a

strong military that fights and prevails by creating a barracks culture within the framework

of stern military discipline. MND will establish a systemic unit management structure

based on a service environment that embraces mutual respect and care, and improve

service conditions to continuously foster an advanced barracks culture. Such efforts will

enable service members to focus on their combat missions and cultivate the military into

an organization beloved and trusted by its citizens.

1. The Need for an Advanced Barracks Culture


An advanced barracks culture is the embodiment of a rational and
democratic military life through which a foundation to fight and prevail
victorious is built based on respect for human rights and citizen’s
confidence.
Mandatory service members of the younger generation grew up in a social
environment wherein strong individualistic tendencies, creativity, and free
will were the focus. Some of them are easily alienated and frustrated by the
military culture that is the hallmark of supervision and leadership, thereby
considering time served in the military as merely lost years. There exists
some cultural estrangement between our society and the military and such
differences in consciousness and culture interferes in establishing a firm
defense posture as well as facilitating social integration. Therefore,


260


-----

Section 1 Cultivating an Advanced Barracks Culture


improvement in barracks culture is not only an essential task for force
generation but also for fostering national defense and the country.
MND identifies and promotes tasks to create an advanced barracks culture
such as developing education to divert officer-first mentality in order to
reestablish basic frameworks for barracks culture. The tasks are reinforced
continuously by evaluating its progress annually.
In March 2007, the Ministry surveyed 321 service members from nine units
of each Service on performance of initiatives to improve barracks culture.
The results showed that 66 percent were satisfied with their military lives,
while 68 percent were satisfied with the improvement efforts.[1) ]

2) Candidate Training
An education to cultivate
talents. In the military, military academies and NCO
schools offer such education
to transform civilians into
service members.


A. Systematized Establishment of Unit Management System
and Development of an Advanced Leadership
In order to improve barracks culture, it is most important to set conditions
to manage units based on norms and systems as well as foster leadership to
lead such efforts.
By establishing the Directive on Management of Units which offers details
on units and its functions, MND will
establish a management system of
units. The effort will mark an
opportunity to establish a clear standard for service member’s basic rights
and responsibilities, and allow
service regulations to take root

Consulting education for officers

naturally.
MND is undergoing various training to equip officers with a better sense of
leadership. Through candidate training[2)] starting 2007, it reinforces education
on leadership by specifying qualities and skills for junior officers. In refresher
training,[3)] it teaches ways to renew mentalities and change counseling

methods by reflecting leadership education that befits each echelon and rank
into its curriculum.
The Ministry is offering opportunities for commanding officers below
regiment levels to verify and develop their leadership during their command
period by allowing a specialized institute to diagnose, evaluate, and teach
leadership. Development of noncommissioned officer (NCO)’s leadership
will also be promoted with the NCO Comprehensive Development Plan.


B. Guaranteeing Service Members’Basic Rights and
Improving Service Conditions

(1) Guaranteeing Service Members’Basic Rights
MND is continuously developing organizations and systems to promote
service members’basic rights.
By establishing the Human Rights Division in MND Headquarters in
January 2006, MND enabled the division to focus on policies and initiatives
to promote service members’basic rights. Furthermore, in December 2007
the Ministry organized the Human Rights Branch in Service Headquarters to
supervise subsidiary units’guarantee of service members’rights and to
implement plans to promote basic rights.
In January 2008, MND amended the Directive on Education for Basic
Rights of Service Members to reinforce such education further. It also plans
to provide a systemic foundation for service members’basic rights by
establishing the Guideline for Basic Rights of Service Members and
Performance Indexes.
The Ministry runs a system where a counselor specializing in basic rights
consults individual service members. Specifically, the counselor is a civilian
expert in counseling and psychology. They focus on counseling individuals
that have difficulty in adapting to the military service, as well as in advising
commanding officers on the skills to manage conflicts regarding service
members’basic rights.
The counselor system went through two years of trial testing from 2005 to


262

Section 1 Cultivating an Advanced Barracks Culture


2006, and 42 counselors were employed in 2008. They were stationed in
units that include: 14 front units under 1st and 3rd ROK Army and the Korea
Army Training Center; Operations Command, Fleets, as well as Marine

Command, Logistics Command, and Education and Training Command for
Air Force. After 2011, the Ministry plans to select 455 counselors to offer
consultation services on basic rights to regiment-level units consultations.

(2) Improving Service Conditions
MND is improving self-discipline in military lives by implementing selfregulating time schedules. It is seeking to establish a military culture where
mandatory servicemen participate voluntarily and are offered opportunities
to regulate one’s own schedule after work hours such as self-improvement
efforts.
In consideration of the environment that the new generation’s mandatory
servicemen grew up in, plans to improve barracks strive for a change from
“lodgment”to “residence.”Barrack renovation is underway and coupled
with plans to establish squad-sized bed type rooms by 2012.
The Ministry plans to increase remuneration for service in special areas,
salary for the enlisted, and expenses for squad leaders.

service conditions.


C. Guaranteeing Conditions for Self-Improvement ☞Refer to Item 3, Section 2,

supplied 170,000 and 250,000 books in 2007 and 2008 respectively,
contributing to service members’increased level of sensibilities.


D. Establishing Integrated Accident Prevention System
Accidents that occur in the units not only hamper combat capabilities but
are also the most critical reason for distrust toward the military. MND is
arranging a scientific accident prevention measure to reduce accidents. It
plans to achieve this by systematizing scientific accident prevention methods
as well as procedures which reflect the characteristics of the new generation’s
mandatory servicemen.

(1) Establishment and Use of a Scientific Accident Management
System
MND plans to develop a new, more reliable character evaluation tool and
utilize this starting late 2009. It will allow an efficient management of
mandatory servicemen by processing data automatically and by accurately
identifying the mentally ill and the maladjusted through a test that best suits
these new generation mandatory servicemen.
Furthermore, the Ministry is developing a method to diagnose stress in the
service and a scientific education program suited to the Korean military to
prevent suicides. There will be trial tests in late 2008 and the initiatives will
then be offered across the military.
Once the scientific accident management system is set, related data such as
analysis of precedents and examples of prevention efforts will be
accumulated and shared in an integrated way. It will do wonders to prevent
accidents as units of all levels can easily utilize related data and share
information real-time.


(2) Improvement in Handling of Personnel Ineligible for Military
Service (noneffectives)
MND is devising “countermeasures against enlistment of those
incompatible to the service”and “early separation measures against the


264

maladjusted”which can systematically manage such personnel from all
phases, from conscription to service.
In the conscription phase, countermeasures against enlistment of those
incompatible to the service are reinforced.
In the boot training phase, timely
measures are available through “phased
assessment of individual’s compatibility

to active-duty service”prior to training’s with an instructor
completion. In the servicing phase, early
separation measures are applied to the maladjusted. Such maladjusted
individuals can be efficiently managed throughout the phases as related data
are automatically shared.
Moreover, efforts will be made to establish/amend related statutes to
transfer maladjusted mandatory servicemen into a replacement[5)] or second
conscription[6)] personnel.


5) Replacement Status
Those judged to be fit for
active duty, but excluded
from active duty or have
been assigned to mandatory
public service because of

Section2. Enhancing Public Benefits and
Protecting Public Rights


The ROK military is putting forth its efforts to go hand in hand with the people in areas

that require military support, while remaining vigilant at all times in defending the nation.

It strives to defend with the people through efficient management of military

installations and easing of regulations, eco-friendly management of forces, active support

activities to assist civilians, and high-quality handling of civil petitions.

1. Management of Military Installations in Consideration of Local Development


MND manages military installations to assure military operations, efficiently
use land, and promote increased benefits for people’s lives.

A. Readjustments of Land Used by the Military
Based on protection of people’s property rights and a law abiding defense
effort, MND is readjusting land used by the military. Land unavoidably used
for operational purposes without the owner’s consent is continuously
compensated for.
The military actively accepts if an owner wishes to trade his property for
military’s idle land. Private land that needs to be continuously used by the
military is obtained in accordance with the Act on Acquisition and
Compensation regarding Land and etc., for Public Projects. The Ministry
obtained 172.07 million ㎡of land and paid out compensation by investing


266


-----

Section 2 Enhancing Public Benefits and Protecting Public Rights

586.8 billion KRW between 1983 and 2007. Status of private land
readjustments is shown in Figure 10-1.

The military returns private land that requires no further military use and
follows lawful process such as receiving owner’s prior consent for land that
requires urgent operational use.
MND also reinforced related systems by establishing the Directive on the
Acquisition of State Property such as the Approval of Execution Plan of
Defense and Military Installations Projects, etc. in June 2008.


B. Promoting Relocation of Military Installations
MND has been planning to relocate military installations since 1966, and is
considering a balanced city development, efficient use of land, and
modernization of military installations as long as they do not interfere with
military operations.
Demand for unit relocation is increasing as downtowns expand. On the
other hand, relocations are sometimes delayed due to protests from locals of
new locations, and delays in land sale sometimes make it difficult to secure
relocation costs. The Ministry completed relocation of 79 units by investing
1743.4 billion KRW between 1998 and 2007. In 2008, it promoted relocation
of 26 units by investing 302.1 billion KRW, and completed four of them. It

plans to promote relocation projects in line with military installation
repositioning efforts.

C. Alleviating Regulations on Military Installation Protection Zone
MND is modifying its military installation protection zone and its regulation
of conduct to the extent that it does not hinder military operations.
The Ministry established the Protection of Military Bases and Military
Installations Act in December 2007. The Act, which was implemented in
September 2008, was a composition of the Protection of Military Installations
Act, the Naval Bases Act, and the Military Air Bases Act. The law focuses on
protecting people’s property rights and minimizing their administrative
inconveniences, and contains information related to easing regulations
regarding military installation protection zones and simplifying various
procedures.
The military installation protection zone was amended as follows.
First, it reduced civilian access control line (CACL)[7)] (restricted protection
zone) from 15km to 10km of the military demarcation line (MDL).


7) Civilian Access Control
Line (CACL)
A line designated by the
Minister of National Defense
to control civilians’access
for operational reasons in
areas adjacent to the MDL
that require high-level military
activities.

8) Restricted Protection
Zone
Areas within military bases
and installations protection
zone adjacent to MDL that
require high-level military
activities and areas that
require preservation of
functions for important military bases and installations.

Furthermore, it reduced the size of the protection zone for military bases
and installations in areas 25km away from the MDL. Furthermore, the
“restricted protection zone”[8)] was reduced from 500m to within 300m, while


268


-----

Section 2 Enhancing Public Benefits and Protecting Public Rights


the “limited protection zone”[9)] was reduced from 1,000m to within 500m.

Such measures thereby relieved or eased a total area of 450 million ㎡(154
times the size of Yeouido) in 58 areas from a protection zone, thus allowing
further protection of people’s property rights.
Specifically, an area of 210 million ㎡(72 times the size of Yeouido) in 38
areas including Seoul, Incheon, Gyeonggi, Gangwon were decategorized
from being a military installation protection zone, thereby granting unbridled
discretions for new construction or expansion efforts. Areas removed from
the “restricted protection zone”to the “limited protection zone”include 240
million ㎡(82 times the size of Yeouido) in 20 areas including Seoul,
Gyeonggi, Gangwon, and Chungnam. Residents of these areas can build
buildings under three stories high within the span of 200㎡without
consultation from the military.
Along with measures to relieve areas from protection, 11 million ㎡in ten
areas including Gapyeong, Gyeonggi and Yuseong, Daejeon were newly
selected as military installation protection zones. The areas are required for
operational purposes as they include places within the boundaries of
Division or above units as well as land used by the military for ammunition
storage. A rough outline on modification of military installation protection
zone is shown in Figure 10-4.

Along with a modified military installation protection zone, the law enacted
in September 2008 reinforces citizen’s exercise of property rights.
In the past, all construction and expansion efforts on buildings or
structures in “restricted protection zone”were prohibited. However, except
for construction of new housing, it is now possible to receive permission if
agreement can be reached with the units of jurisdiction. In addition, MND
established the “request for land purchase system.”If an owner wishes to
sell land with a considerably diminished utility or land impossible for usage
and generation of profits, the military can purchase it within the boundaries
of available budget.
As a subsequent measure to law amendment, the Ministry established the
enforcement ordinance and regulation in September 2008, and further eased
restrictions. Details include simplifying access to the “restricted protection
zone”; abrogating a rule that requires prior consultation with military units
for small-scale construction efforts that needs be declared under the current


270


-----

Section 2 Enhancing Public Benefits and Protecting Public Rights

Building Act; offering information on areas appointed as protected zones via
the Land Use Regulation Information Service (LURIS); and improving ways to
label and set stone posts in protected zones.
The Ministry will continuously ease regulation--such as expanding
entrustment of coordinated projects to local governments--to resolve citizen’s
inconveniences and enhance their benefits.


D. Reducing Local Residents’Inconveniences by Improving the
Fences
MND seeks to alleviate citizen’s inconveniences while establishing a
scientific patrol system by progressively improving iron fencing along coastal
and riverside areas.
While maintaining iron fencing in certain areas for security reasons, the
Ministry is removing fences in less-vulnerable areas such as beach resorts. It
plans to introduce scientific surveillance equipment to supplement such
measures and uphold vigilance.
The project to improve iron fencing is divided into phases. For phase 1,
the military removed 21.1km of fence in 54 areas along the East Coast in
2007. For phase 2, it is removing 43.2km of them in 40 areas, to be
completed by 2009.

2. Eco-Friendly Military Management


The environment is an important determinant for quality of life. Nations
around the world, including the Republic of Korea, are striving for
sustainable development wherein a balance can be struck between the
economy and society and the environment.
In wake of such changes, the Ministry is exerting various efforts to manage
the military in an eco-friendly way.


271


-----

Chapter 10 The Armed Forces Serving the People

A. Development of Military Environment Management System
MND is handling military environment issues efficiently by establishing a
mutual support and coordinating system between the military and the
government. As of 1998, the Central Government-Military Environmental
Consultative Committee (GMECC) between MND and the Ministry of
Environment, and Local GMECC between regional unit commanders and
local government office for environment have been held biannually.


Training early measures on environment polluting
accidents


Practical training during a traveling military
education on environment


MND is reinforcing expertise of those specialized in environment-related
fields by improving relevant organizations and developing training and
education systems.
First, it is securing expert talent by establishing criteria for environment
managing organizations, which reflects characteristics of each Service and
subsidiary units. In June 2007, it established two battalion-level units
specialized in environmental issues to support early action on pollutionrelated accidents and purification projects for USFK bases returned to ROK.
In addition, it is developing and operating various education programs to
imbue individual service members with an eco-friendly mindset. It is also
reinforcing specialized environment-related education as well as military
environment education tours through Service schools.

B. Expanding Projects to Prevent Environmental Pollution
Units of each level are conducting themselves in an eco-friendly way by
installing pollution preventing facilities as designated by environment-related
statutes and by upgrading old equipments currently under operation.


272


-----

Section 2 Enhancing Public Benefits and Protecting Public Rights

As of late 2007, 3,716 water pollution preventing facilities has been
installed and operated in respective units. Units placed within the
geographical boundaries of sewage treating areas of local governments are
safely handling waste by connecting its pipeline to public sewage disposal
plants. Units also heightened measures to prevent water pollution by
delegating management and operation of wastewater treatment facilities of
military bases to companies with specialized skills.
Furthermore, units installed automatic oil leak detectors and oil-preventing
bumps to prevent oil-related pollutions. They are also preventing
underground oil leaks by placing oil pipelines above ground. By periodically
sampling the pollution level around oil storage facilities, units enable swift
purification efforts whenever ground pollution has been detected.
With modification of the Sewerage Act in September 2007, the standard
level of water quality allowed to be discharged by wastewater treatment
facilities for military bases became more stringent. In response to such
changes, the Ministry plans to reflect the budget necessary to improve
military environmental facilities into the Mid-term Defense Plan and
progressively improve it. Status on efforts to secure and improve military
basic environmental facilities is shown in Table 10-2.

MND is reinforcing management of military waste disposal and its
recycling efforts. Daily trash, if possible, is handled via entrustment to local
authorities, while those that cannot be treated are sent to military incinerators.
Designated refuse and construction waste that can worsen pollution such as
rejected oil and acids are handled by companies that specialize in waste
disposal. Status of military waste disposal in 2007 is shown in Table 10-3.

C. Civil Support to Protect Nature
The ROK military actively supports national policies regarding preservation
of environment to an extent that it does not impede its primary missions.
Examples of such activities include: each unit taking care of one mountain
and one river; national land cleansing campaigns; supporting efforts to purify


274


-----

Section 2 Enhancing Public Benefits and Protecting Public Rights

the Han River; supporting efforts to purify
remote islands; and supporting waste
retrieval in flooded areas. Every year, 1.5
million service members retrieve around
12,000 tons of trash.

D. Measures against Noise from Airfields and Shooting
Ranges
Several civil petitions, lawsuits, and conflicts occur annually in relation to
noise from military facilities.
MND is establishing and promoting measures to reduce the noise-level in
order to guarantee appropriate conditions for military training while
minimizing noise-related damages to locals residing near airfields and
shooting ranges. Exerted efforts include setting flight routes and altitudes in
consideration of densely populated areas nearby and construction of 13 hush
houses to minimize noise during aircraft maintenance.
In order to fundamentally resolve the noise issue, the Ministry is seeking to
establish the Special Act on Military Noise. It has been examining noise
levels in airfields and ranges and it derived the required budget as well as
assessment on effects of noise by using research agencies in 2007.

E. Management of Environment in Returned USFK Bases
USFK bases are being returned in accordance with the ROK-U.S. Land
Partnership Plan (LPP), the Yongsan Relocation Plan (YRP), and the Status of
Forces Agreement (SOFA). From the target of 80 bases up for return, 40 have
been handed over by 2008. From the pool of returned bases, 18 were
environmentally sound while the remaining 22 were determined to require
purification projects in accordance with domestic environment-related
statutes.
Returned USFK bases are passed down to local governments after
necessary measures are taken. The Ministry’s measures include: examining


276


-----

Section 2 Enhancing Public Benefits and Protecting Public Rights

facilities inside the returned bases; establishing returned base management
plan and reporting it to the National Assembly; undertaking environment
purification projects; and tearing down facilities and determining whether
there are assets to be utilized.
When removal of facilities and environment purification are completed
after these measures, it would hand the bases over to the appropriate
authorities.
The Ministry plans to openly and transparently promote environment
purification projects on returned USFK bases in coordination with related
local governments.


3. Reinforcing Disaster Management and Support
System

A. Prevention of Disasters and Establishing Readiness
Posture
There has been a recent increase in natural disasters such as typhoons,
floods, and snowstorms as well as accidents such as wildfire, epidemics, and
oil leaks. The trend nowadays has been for damages from such disasters to
be more massive than ever, thus increasing demands for military support for
disaster prevention and recovery efforts.
As the nation’s military working under a comprehensive notion of national
security, MND undertakes policies to actively support efforts when national
disasters erupt as long as it does not interfere with its basic duties.



Training for extinguishing fire on cultural assets

Chapter 10 The Armed Forces Serving the People

First, it is solidifying an inter-agency cooperation system. In August 2005, it
signed an agreement on disaster cooperation with the Central Disaster Safety
Measures Headquarters. In November 2007, it agreed on detailed procedures
among 197 units and 248 local governments by pre-assigning supporting
units to local entities. In December 2007, it signed an agreement with the
Ministry of Land, Transport, and Maritime Affairs (MLTM) and Korea Coast
Guard regarding search and rescue coordination for aircraft accidents.
Second, it is modifying and applying regulations and manuals for disaster
management. In January 2007, a mission handbook for defense disaster
management was published and distributed to inter-departments and agencies.
In August, it established a command manual for each of the five major disaster
types such as typhoons, heavy snowfalls, and torrential downpours in
connection with the government’s standard manual for crisis management.
Third, it is reinforcing education on disaster management and support. It
offers education through specialized agencies from within and outside the
military as well as lecturing tours to improve proficiency in damage recovery,
and participates in the Safe Korea Exercise (SKE). In addition, it offers
disaster countermeasures staff meeting, lectures by experts, and seminars to
commanding officers, service members, and disaster-related officials from all
levels.
Fourth, it is improving infrastructure for disaster management. It enabled
the MND Disaster Management Information System (DMIS) to use
information on technical personnel on alternative service by adding it into
the database. Furthermore, by modifying the Army Disaster Management
Information System, it sends out real-time disaster reports and efficiently
manages disasters.
MND has determined the standard amount of equipment and materiel
necessary by considering disaster types and unit characteristics, and also
secured and managed them through coordination with local entities.
However, efficient rescue and support missions are limited since it is difficult
to secure budgets for disaster-support equipment, calling for further
coordination between the Ministry and local entities.

Section 2 Enhancing Public Benefits and Protecting Public Rights

B. Promoting Emergency Rescue and Restoration Support
MND maintains a disaster readiness posture to swiftly undertake
emergency rescue support by operating 35 search and rescue units and 210
disaster countermeasure centers. Procedures for disaster support are shown
in Figure 10-5.

C. Direction of Defense Disaster Management
MND is reinforcing specialized education and practical training to prevent
disasters and to respond to disasters in ways of recovery efforts upon
occurrence.
It plans to improve its ability to manage disasters by expanding each
Service’s organization and staff specialized in disaster management every
year and by assigning rescue units that focus on special disasters and islands.
Moreover, by actively participating in large-scale disasters in foreign
countries, the Ministry seeks to improve the ROK’s status in the global
community.

4. Reinforcing Civil Support Activities


Typically, MND offers active civil support by leveraging available
personnel, equipment, and skills to places that require military assistance as
long as it does not interfere with MND’s everyday duties.
During the farming season, the Ministry supports manpower for rice
planting and reaping in rural areas where sowing and harvesting are limited
due to scarcity of labor. It also upgrades agricultural infrastructure related to
structural changes in rural communities by maintaining waterways and
improving rivers. It offers technical support as well, by organizing a “farm
machine repair patrol service team,”which makes rounds to areas without
service centers to repair farming equipment.

5. Improving Civil Petitions Work

In 2006, MND introduced its vision to achieve an advanced defense civil
petitions administration, and focused on providing high-quality civil petitionrelated services.
In January 2007, by modifying the Directive on MND Civil Petitions
Treatment, it increased the number of subjects applicable for “File From
Anywhere”service[10)] to fifteen. In February, it published the Guidebook for
MND Civil Petitions Process by reinforcing the existing Manual for MND Civil
Petitions to promote people’s understanding of defense civil affairs.
Furthermore, it introduced a service system to provide unit phone numbers
and upgraded conditions for the MND Civil Petitions Office in order to
improve overall satisfaction on civil petitions-related services.

(1) Provide Comprehensive Information Service on Military
Telephone Numbers
Military units by nature are relatively difficult to access for the average
civilian. In fact, unit telephone numbers were only available through the
MND or Service HQs’civil petitions offices. It was especially difficult and
inconvenient to get numbers during after-hours, holidays, or during the
nighttime. To accommodate such difficulties, the Ministry established a onestop service system in May 2007 to provide guidance on unit telephone
numbers. It allowed a caller to be informed of military unit phone numbers
by calling a single 8-digit number (1577-9090) from anywhere across the
country at any hour of the day. By knowing just the unit names, civilians can
now receive numbers for Battalion or above units and even get connected
directly through this service.
The service is earning wide reception from the people as over 20,000 uses
were recorded just three months after its initiation.

It increased convenience facilities for

MND Civil Petitions Office people including two counseling rooms

made available by reshuffling office areas,

Section 3 Improvement of Military Service and Administration Systems

Section3. Improvement of Military Service
and Administration Systems


MND is improving the military service system in order to upgrade the military’s combat

capabilities and promote equality in fulfilling conscription duties. Major areas for

improvement are: reducing the service period; introducing the extended service system;

improving the Alternative Service System; and introducing the civilian service system.

Furthermore, the Ministry is ensuring transparency and fairness in the conscription

decision process; setting efficient management systems for conscription resources;

running a conscriptee-based system; and expanding the internet-based civil petitions

system in order to establish an advanced conscription infrastructure.

1. Improving Military Service System


A. Reducing Service Period for the Enlisted
MND is gradually reducing the service period to relieve citizens’burdens
and allow more people to fulfill their obligations by assigning service duties
fairly.
Such policy was derived after a comprehensive review of mid and longterm prospects for conscription resources as well as military reforms, under
the premise that current military capacities will be maintained. Service time
will be gradually reduced by six months over the course of eight years and
two months from January 2008 to February 2016. Methods to shorten
conscription duties and its reduced period are shown in Figure 10-6.

The six month reduction in service period applies not only to active-duty
mandatory servicemen in Army/Navy/Air Force, but also to full-time
reservists, riot police, security personnel in correctional facilities, and
conscripted firemen. Period reduced for various services are shown in Table
10-9.


Table 10-9. Period reduced for various services

|Applied to:|Current|After Reduction|
|---|---|---|
|Army, Marine Corps, Auxiliary Police, Security personnel in correctional facilities, full-time reservists|24 months|18 months|
|Navy, Coastal Police, Conscripted Firemen|26 months|20 months|
|Air Force|27 months|21 months|



Furthermore, service period for some public service personnel will be
reduced by four months, from 26 to 22 months, to be treated fair with the
active-duty personnel. The recipients of such reduction will be administrative
government office staffs who perform security, monitoring, protection,
service, or administrative duties at national agencies, local governments,
public organizations, and community service facilities.


11) Extended Service
System
A system that allows volunteers to be paid to serve for
an extended period after
their service. The system
seeks to secure those
expert servicemen adroit in
combat and skills who will
be difficult to retain once the
military service time has been
reduced and advancedequipment operating servicemen who will be needed
once high-tech equipment
are adopted following Defense Reforms.

286


B. Introducing Extended Service System[11) ]

Reducing the service period promotes equality in fulfilling military service
duties and relieves citizen’s burdens. There are still concerns, however, that


-----

Section 3 Improvement of Military Service and Administration Systems

it can cause reduction in military capacities
due to rapid turnover rate of service
members and lack of expert servicemen.
The Ministry, in order to prevent deterioration of military capacities and efficiently
use national human resources, implement
Commissioning of Staff Sergeantsthrough extended service system ed the extended service system in January
(January 2008) 2008.

The basic policy guiding the extended
service system is the following. First, they are paid and managed the same as
the enlisted during their conscription period. Second, they are promoted to
staff sergeants and receive treatment due a noncommissioned officer (NCO)
during their remainder time in consideration of their proficiency and
expertise.
Extended service system is divided into combat and skills expert
servicemen and advanced-equipment operating servicemen.


Table 10-10. Extended Service System per Type

|Classifi- cation|Selected by|Service Time|Service Area|Salary|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Type Ⅰ|Service Chiefs|6-18 months of additional service|Combat skills related posts (Squad leader, Radar, etc.)|KRW 1.2 million per month|
|Type Ⅱ|Chief of MMA|3 years|Posts related to advanced-equipment (Next tanks, KDX-Ⅲ, etc.)|KRW 1.2 million per month * Subsidy payments not included|



-  MMA: Ministry of Manpower Administration


Combat and skill expert servicemen (type I) are selected from experienced
servicemen and serve as staff sergeants once they complete their
conscriptions. Advanced-equipment operating servicemen (type II) are
selected from civilian volunteers prior to their conscription fulfillments and
serve for three years. They serve as servicemen during their conscription
period and as staff sergeants for the remaining years.


287


-----

Chapter 10 The Armed Forces Serving the People

The extended service system is an essential system to transform the military
into an advanced, technology-intensive structure. It will be reinforced and
improved through trial tests from 2008 to 2009 and will employ 40,000
servicemen by 2020.


C. Improving Alternative Service System[12)]

Although the alternative service system
contributed to development of national
industries and provided general services to
the people, it incurred problems in terms
of conscription fairness as well as efficiency
in use of human resources. In recognition,
the Ministry has been continually improv- On-site education for public
ing its alternative service system. service personnel
Among public interest duties, the
Ministry gradually reduced simple administrative office work and expanded
tasks in the social service areas. By implementing the non consecutive
system, it allowed public service personnel to defer service to treat illness or
support household affairs and return to serve his remaining years. It also
allowed public service personnel to serve as a skilled industrial personnel if it
was his desire to be employed in order to support his household.
The minimum service time required in transferring posts for technical
research personnel serving in military-designated institutions such as national
research institutes and university/corporate research centers has been
reduced from two years to 18 months and their options for institutions have
widened in order to promote efficiency in HR management.
Moreover, the policy of allowing the most appropriate personnel, i.e.
skilled industrial personnel, to be leveraged in leading corporations has
contributed to an improved national industrial competitiveness.

System
A system to efficiently use
surplus human resources
after supplementing activeduty service positions,
whereby national duties

Section 3 Improvement of Military Service and Administration Systems


D. Implementing Civilian Service System
In order to reinforce problems in the alternative service system and
respond to increasing demand for community service, MND established a
plan in July 2007 to improve the military service system which includes the
civilian service system.[13)] Its details are shown below.
First, promote equality in the system by modifying current conscription
standards to impose civilian service to individuals who are exempted from
active-duty but are capable of social activities with partial limitations.
Second, promote efficiency in use of human resources by modifying public
service personnel’s areas of service and committing them to work in areas
where the community needs help but is unable to supply sufficient
manpower, such as providing assistance to the disabled or the elderly.
Third, reinforce civilian service personnel’s sense of responsibility and
expertise by offering education on basic knowledge and duties. Basic
knowledge education was conducted for 5,000 personnel in 2007. The
Ministry provided such education services by establishing an education
center for civilian service personnel in six major areas across the nation and
developed re-education programs for servicemen regarded as not having
totally fulfilled their duties. It also protects civilian service personnel’s rights
and interests, while preventing incomplete task fulfillment by establishing 19
Service Management Centers nationally, organizing frequent visits by civilian
service supervisors, and offering individual consultations.
Fourth, gradually reduce and abolish the secondment service system[14)]

(i.e. auxiliary police, government issued fire fighter, etc.) and the alternative
service system (i.e. skilled industrial personnel, etc.). MND will reduce the
number of personnel in secondment service by 20 percent each year until
2011 and will abolish this system in 2012. However, the number of auxiliary
police will remain at its 2009-level during 2010 to 2011 in order to maintain
capacities for public order and will then be shut down in 2012. Among
skilled industrial personnel, 4,500 will be assigned to active-duty services
until 2011 while its reservist duty personnel will be reduced every year by 20
percent until it is shut down in 2012. Furthermore, it will minimize

accusations of special treatment by overhauling standards regarding
assignment of fine arts and sports personnel.


2. Improving Administration of Conscription Affairs

MND is increasing its accuracy in grading physical examinations by
securing high-tech equipment and a scientific precision system. It undertakes
a transparent examination and decision-making process by expanding the
participation of outside civilian staffs.
By expanding a system that embraces individual choice, the Ministry seeks
to improve self-regulation in conscription duties and increase satisfaction in
civil petitions-related services.


A. Improving Equality and Fairness in Assigning Military
Duties
MND is improving the accuracy of
physical examinations for conscription by
increasing high-tech medical equipment
and personnel. Blood cell tests are
conducted on all examinees and AIDS tests
are handled by all local Military Manpower
Administration Offices. Rare, obstinate Illness examination
illnesses that cannot be examined by these
offices are entrusted to specializing civilian hospitals. Moreover, transparency
in the conscription process is promoted by increasing the participation of
outside staff such as those from civil organizations in the examination
process.
The Ministry is undergoing research to embody noblesse oblige[15) ]in order
to ratchet up higher-ranking class’fulfillment of conscription duties. It plans
to promote statutes to specially manage their fulfillment of duties based on
results from research and public hearings.


15) Noblesse Oblige
A higher level moral obligation required from highranking officials.

Section 3 Improvement of Military Service and Administration Systems

B. Modifying Related Laws
MND has reinforced related statutes in order to encourage self-regulated
duty fulfillment and proper military culture. It has amended the Military
Service Act four times since March 2006. Through such efforts, it established
foundations for the following: Introducing a system for public interest
veterinarians to undertake livestock quarantine tasks (March 2006);
abrogating the requirement for permission to travel overseas for those 24 or
under yet to have fulfilled their conscription duties (September 2006);
introducing doctors and clinical psychologists specializing in physical
examinations in order to increase credibility of its grading decisions (October
2006); implementing the extended service system in order to attract and
secure talented human resources (July 2007).
In December 2007, the Ministry amended the Enforcement Decree of the
Military Service Act. By decreasing the number of individuals from the arts
and sporting sectors recommended for public interest duties, the Ministry
narrowed the ground for exemption from active or reservist duty services.
In October 2007, by modifying the Enforcement Rule of the Military Service
Act it increased people’s convenience in civil petitions by exempting them
from submitting technical certificate documents while allowing exchanges
directly via an administrative network.


C. Improving Convenience for Service Members Doing
Duties
MND assures self-regulation in conscription duties by implementing a system
where an individual can choose their
enlistment dates and report sites. It plans
to stabilize the trend by increasing
individual choice to reach over 60 percent,
in order to cultivate a sense of autonomy Enlistment

Section 4 Respect and Compensation for Veterans


Section4.

Respect and Compensation for Veterans


The government seeks to systematize compensation for sacrificed veterans and grant

privileges as a part of national responsibility. It changed the name of the West Sea

Conflict in 2002 to the second Naval Battle of Yeonpyeong and elevated its occasion for

remembrance to a national commemorative event in order to pay tribute to noble

sacrifices made in the line of duty. Furthermore, it is exerting efforts to recover the

remains of veterans and to reinforce compensation for accidents and illnesses sustained

during service.

1. Recovering Korean War Killed in Action


Recovering Korean War Killed in Action (KIA) is a project to recover
remains of 130,000 veterans from the Korean War and lay them to rest in the
National Cemetery.
The initiative, which begun under Army leadership as part of the projects
in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Korean War, required a more
systematic and organized effort due to the following reasons: limited data on


Joint enshrinement

-----

Chapter 10 The Armed Forces Serving the People

KIA; aging Korean War veterans; and land developments causing rapid
changes in topography and damages to the remains.
Therefore the Ministry elevated the project to a MND-led effort and thus
established the MND Agency for Killed in Action Recovery & ID (MAKRI) in
January 2007 to fulfill the responsibility of worshiping the spirits of national
defense.


A. Remains Recovery and Identification
MAKRI benchmarks the U.S. Joint Prisoners of War, Missing in Action
Accounting Command (JPAC) and systematically handles the entire process
from examination of remains, recovery efforts, to identification.

A site for recovering remains Examining remains and relics


As a result, 534 remains were recovered in 2007, a 200 percent increase
from prior to the group’s establishment and 837 remains in 2008, a
considerable jump from the previous year. Moreover, DNA samples (blood)
necessary for identification were gathered from war-bereaved families while
success in identification and finding families improved significantly. Status on
gathering required information is shown in Table 10-12.

Section 4 Respect and Compensation for Veterans

B. Establishing Groundwork for Continuous Promotion of
Projects
Recovery of remains is the nation’s eternal responsibility that must be
sustained until everyone is brought back home. The Ministry established the
Act on Recovery, etc. of the Korean War Killed in Action in March 2008 to
establish a legal foundation to persistently pursue the recovery of remains.
The basic spirit of the law expounds that recovering the remains of
veterans is a national responsibility. Its details are outlined below.
MND imposes on all citizens the responsibility to protect and manage
remains, thereby encouraging their cooperation in examining the possible
burial sites of remains and recovery efforts. There are regulations that
penalize those who discover remains and fail to report such findings, those
who damage such sites or remains, or those who deal with such properties
under their own discretions.
In the meanwhile, those who report their discoveries of remains and relics
or inform authorities on possible burial sites can receive a reward based on
recovery results. Furthermore, local governments are told to cooperate in
order to promote such efforts.
The Ministry published the consolidated
booklet on the possible burial sites of the
Korean War KIA - which identifies on a
map where remains may be buried - and
distributed this to Regiment or above units
and local governments across the nation.
Such efforts allowed for a more systematic The booklet on the possible burialsites of the Korean War KIA
finding of possible burial sites as well as (published in November 2007)
recoveries, while preventing damages from
local developments.
Moreover, the Ministry is putting forth efforts to establish an infrastructure
to unilaterally perform the identification process and improve its verification
rate. It hired civilian advisors and equipped the Scientific Investigation
Laboratory, MND Criminal Investigation Command with facility and


295


-----

Chapter 10 The Armed Forces Serving the People

equipment for DNA testing.
In December 2008, the Ministry established an Identification Lab to rid the
MND of the old verification method that relied on the naked eye and
Preservation House with capacity to preserve unidentified remains. In order
to upgrade staff expertise, the Ministry is expanding domestic and
international training opportunities while operating advisory groups in each
field.


C. Future Tasks
The Ministry’s efforts notwithstanding, successful recovery rate remains
low at 1.5 percent of total remains, and the Ministry established the Action
Plan to Activate Recovery of the Korean War KIA in July 2008 in order to
improve the overall rate. Details for the plan, to be implemented starting
2009, are shown below.
First, the Ministry dispatches regional probes on possible burial sites of
Korean War KIA by the Divisions and completes primary level examinations
on scattered battle sites within three years.
Second, the Ministry improves success in recovery by departing from a
MAKRI-centered recovery and supplementing overall efforts by organizing
provisional recovery teams by corps-level echelons to run its own projects.
Third, in order to improve verification rate, gathering blood samples from
bereaved families, a service previously only provided by military hospitals,
will be offered by public health centers across the nation as well. Fourth, by
forming a separate cooperative committee focusing on organic coordination
and support between Ministries, the recovery project will be promoted as a
government-wide initiative.
In the meantime, as the two Koreas agreed at the Defense Ministerial Talks
in November 2007 to cooperate in recovery of remains, the government
plans to focus on recovering remains buried in North Korea as well as the
DMZ.


296


-----

Section 4 Respect and Compensation for Veterans

2. Increasing Compensation for Accidents and
Illness during the Service


Compensation for service members sacrificed in the line of duty is
comparable to around 60 percent of the compensation level for accidents
involving civilians, This is an extremely low figure considering service
member’s contributions to the nation. In particular, compensation for those
sacrificed during military service is only 36.56 million KRW, calling for
proper national-level compensation.
Therefore the Ministry is seeking to increase the standard remuneration to
grant proper compensation for service members sacrificed in the line of duty.
Moreover, by increasing overall medical support including treatment of
illness sustained during service, the Ministry is improving service member’s
overall health as well as their confidence for the military.
If a service member requires continuous treatment after retirement because
of an illness or a disability sustained during service, he/she can defer
retirement for six months and receive medical treatment from a military
facility. If a military facility is incapable of such treatments, then the Ministry
allows entrusted treatment from civilian hospitals. Furthermore, the number
of veterans eligible for military medical treatment increased as the required
twenty years of service was reduced to ten.

policies.


(1) Invigorate System for Disclosure of Information
Keeping abreast with the government’s information disclosure system,[17)] in
July 2006 the Ministry amended MND Guidelines on Disclosure of
Administration Information established in 2003 and widened the extent of
disclosure for administrative information. Also, by increasing the number of
outside members in Information Disclosure Council from one to two, it
strengthened the council’s function of pre-deliberation. It also imposed ROK
JCS, Service HQs, and chiefs of direct and subsidiary agencies the
responsibility to disclose spending of operating costs. This had been
previously imposed only on MND agency chiefs.
Starting 2004, the Ministry inspects and assesses the status of information
disclosure activities by agencies of different levels. It sends out examples of
exemplary agencies across the military and offers a variety of incentives such
as meritorious service citations.

(2) Disclosing Original Texts of Signed Documents
Although in the past the Ministry had to list information on its website by
hand, the listing can now be done automatically. It also expanded its extent
of disclosures by allowing original texts of non-confidential signed
documents to be listed online.
While the majority of other Ministries merely offer information lists on their
websites, the MND operates a system that even discloses original texts of
signed documents. In 2007, the Ministry disclosed 36,195 information lists
and 4,896 signed papers of original texts.
The Ministry strives to achieve administrative transparency that can be felt
by citizens by actively guaranteeing their right to know, except for
confidential information related to national security.


17) Information Disclosure
System
A system to improve administrative transparency, encourage citizen’s participation
in national agendas, and
satisfy their right to know by
disclosing information owned
/managed by national agencies, local governments,
government investment
agencies, and other public
agencies in response to
people’s demands. Even if
there is no such demand,
the system encourages
active disclosure of information for important issues.

B. Invigorating Defense PR
MND not only relies on existing media but actively promotes a two-way
marketing via new media such as internet portal sites and blogs in order to
spread news on defense policies more effectively. It is also improving a
planned marketing system to revitalize policy marketing while identifying PR
subjects during the weekly Defense PR Meetings.


(1) Invigorating Defense PR
The Ministry relays national topics of
interest through regular daily briefings and
timely briefings given to the press gallery.
Moreover, the military’s marketing medium
such as the Defense Daily, Korea Forces
Network Television (KFN-TV), and the
Defense Journal are also utilized to convey

defense policies to the people in real-time.
KFN-TV, a military broadcasting station, has established itself as an efficient
medium to directly convey news from the military through satellite broadcasting and local cable networks.
The Ministry is steadily improving its online marketing in step with the
Information Era. It is continuously upgrading the MND website to improve

people’s understanding and accessibility while using its blog--On the Same
Boat (http://mnd9090.tistory.com)--as a main channel of communication
with the Netizens (network-using citizens). Furthermore, starting in 2003, it
began a Policy Customer Service[18)] which sends policy-related data to the
direct parties or those interested via e-mail.
In addition to online efforts, the Ministry is reinforcing its PR activities offline as well. It offers activities such as policy presentations and security site
tours to those from different social circles who can lead public opinion. It
sponsors defense training activities for teenagers, military experiencing
events, production of movies and TV films, and local cultural events and
simplifies procedures to enter security sites during tours.

(2) Reinforcing Capacities for a Planning PR System
The Ministry strives to build understanding as well as consensus on
defense policies and secure nation-wide support.
In such spirit, the Ministry establishes PR plans as it shapes major policies,
with assistance from marketing specialists. It seeks to improve marketing
capacities of all its staff by periodically offering situation-specific PR
education. Moreover, the Ministry identifies subjects for strategic marketing
for the MND, ROK JCS, and each Service and discusses various agendas
during the weekly Defense PR Meetings.


18) Policy Customer Service
A set of activities to earn
support and understanding
for defense policies through
a two-way communication
with policy clients such as

Founding of the Armed Forces

**1945-1950**


Founding of the Armed Forces

As division between South-North was increasingly being imbedded following independence from Japan, the Republic of Korea established its official
government in 1948 and renamed Department of Internal Security--the legacy of the U.S. military oversight era (‘45-‘48)--to the Ministry of National
Defense. In 1948, the ROK reorganized Korean Constabulary and Korean Coast Guard into ROK Army and Navy. Marine Corps and Air Force was
established in 1949, completing so-called “National Armed Forces’Three Branch of Service System.”

War and Post-War

The Korean War, caused by North Korea’s invasion of the South, did not only result in massive human casualties and property damages, but also
underscored the importance of having a national military to defend the nation. The government signed the ROK-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty on
October 1, 1953, and laid the groundwork for a combined defense system to recover from war damages and to prepare for further invasion from the
North.

strong support that Secretary Gates and the U.S. government gave for the Foreign Military


Sales (FMS) status upgrade for the ROK.

two countries on the War Reserve Stockpile for Allies-Korea (WRSA-K) transfer, and signed

the combined defense capabilities.

hospitality extended to him and his delegation by the Government of the United States,

not only strengthened the U.S.-ROK Alliance, but also significantly contributed to its

development into a future-oriented strategic Alliance. Both sides agreed to hold the 41st
