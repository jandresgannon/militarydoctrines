# INTRODUCTION


###### he 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) set out the Government’s vision for a secure and prosperous United Kingdom with global reach and influence.
# T

###### We face a changing security environment that is complex and dangerous for the UK and our national interests. No country is able to address all the challenges alone. Strong alliances and partnerships are more important than ever.

 As set out in the SDSR, we are making our defence policy ‘International by Design’, ensuring that we make those partnerships and alliances central to all that we do. Our international stance has been reinforced since the UK voted to leave the EU. We will take a long-term, pro-active approach to our international engagement, rather than just reacting in crises or to events as they unfold.

 Defence engagement is the use of our people and assets to prevent conflict, build stability and gain influence. It is a major component of making defence international by design. We build strategic relationships with key countries and act as a leader in international organisations such as NATO and the UN. We work closely with other nations’ forces, both to operate together and to collaborate together on developing our capabilities and equipment. In the last few years, our activity has ranged from training Ukrainian forces, helping lead the global response to Ebola and training Lebanese Land Border regiments to secure their border. We have held joint exercises with a broad range of countries around the world, from Oman to Japan. We are developing new joint forces with European allies. Underpinning all of this is our global defence and diplomatic network, working to build influence globally and to keep Britain and our interests secure.

 Defence engagement projects influence, promotes our prosperity and helps to protect our people. It enables the UK to respond to threats and crises when they emerge, and strengthens our position as the world’s leading soft power. In short, it is vital to UK interests.

 In recognition of the importance of this work, and as set out in the SDSR, we have made defence engagement a funded, core MOD task for the first time, meaning that the Armed Forces will prioritise it alongside other core tasks. This is a step-change in our approach.

 This International Defence Engagement Strategy sets out how defence engagement contributes to delivering our vision of security and prosperity with strengthened influence to further our interests across the world.

**Fig 1: Defence Engagement Objectives’ relationship with the National Security Objectives**

The Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015 (SDSR 15) describes a more complex and dangerous
security environment where threats to the UK are growing. The key threats are terrorism, extremism and
instability; cyber; and the weakening of the rules-based international order, making it more difficult to
achieve the consensus needed to deal with global threats.

The SDSR established three overarching national security objectives to deal with these threats: to ‘protect
**our people’, ‘project our global influence’ and ‘promote our prosperity’. The National Security Council**
(NSC), chaired by the Prime Minister, ensures these objectives are implemented and that there is joined-up
strategic decision-making at the top of government.


**_“Our ambitious vision for Britain …is…a Britain…in which we play our full_**
**_part in promoting peace and prosperity around the world. And in which_**
**_we – with our brilliant armed forces and intelligence services – protect our_**
**_national interests, our national security, and the security of our allies.”_**

**UK Armed Forces are deployed as Short Term**
Training Teams around the globe to deliver
capacity building for partners. Here a soldier from
2nd Battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment, trains
soldiers of the Nigerian Army in 2015 to enable
Nigeria to counter the threat from Boko Haram.


The government is taking a ‘full-spectrum’ approach, harnessing all the tools of national power available
to tackle the threats we face. Defence’s response includes making British defence policy ‘International by
**Design’, using defence engagement to promote our interests and project our influence overseas, engaging**
with partners globally to prevent conflict, build stability and bring prosperity. This demands a long-term,
persistent and consistent approach, with Defence working closely with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office
(FCO) and all of Government. While the government will always retain the ability to respond to crises with force,
long-term strategic security requires continued defence engagement effort, as part of our wider diplomacy,
integrated with other forms of national power.

Defence engagement contributes to all three of the national security objectives:

- **Protect our people will include armed force where necessary, and diplomacy, law enforcement, economic**
policy, deterrence, cyber and covert means. Defence engagement will enable these by developing the
security relationships, understanding and influence needed to enact these methods of protection.

**•** **Project our influence is strongly supported by the international influence provided by the bilateral**
and multilateral security relationships developed through our defence engagement, alongside the
government’s broader security, development and diplomacy activities.

**•** **Promote our prosperity, is assisted by the critical role of Defence in securing the stability needed for**
economic development and the security required for international trade, as well as a strong role for
defence engagement and its global network in cultivating the relationships that will support business and
exports.

These three national security objectives will only be achieved through an integrated, cross-government effort
and with international partners and allies. At the heart of this are: NATO, where the UK plays a key leadership
**role; our strategic bilateral relationships; and our permanent membership of the UN Security Council,**
notably the lead we took in organising the UN Peacekeeping conference in London in 2016, and our
position in the forefront of work on Women, Peace and Security and the Prevention of Sexual Violence
**Initiative. Our security collaboration with countries in Europe is particularly important, as is our intelligence**
collaboration as part of the Five- Eyes community of the UK, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Our
work through the Five Power Defence Arrangements in the Asia-Pacific region and our relationships with
organisations such as the African Union are also vital to the achievement of our objectives. We will use our
defence engagement to build and strengthen these key relationships.

As we leave the European Union we will be more prominent on the world stage than ever: an outward-facing,
**global partner at the heart of international efforts to secure peace and prosperity for all our people. The UK**
will continue to be one of the principal security and defence actors in Europe and the world, demonstrated
by our ongoing commitment to spend 2% of GDP on defence and 0.7% of GNI on international aid. Our
commitment to our extensive security cooperation with international partners remains steadfast.

Defence engagement is the fullest demonstration of that commitment, and through our global network we will
use it to reinforce the excellence of our forces deployed around the world and our ability to secure influence

**SDSR 2015**


###### International approach to British Defence policy and planning[1]

The SDSR details how the UK’s interests are inextricably linked to global security and prosperity, and that we will

engage globally to protect our interests and strengthen the rules-based international order. Acknowledging

that we cannot address all risks on our own, a key policy outcome of the SDSR was to adopt an approach that

makes British Defence policy and planning International by Design to deliver our National Security Objectives.

**International relationships**

We will take a comprehensive approach to developing broad and deep relationships with international allies

and partners. We will deepen our existing defence and diplomatic relationships. We will increase our leverage

by aligning our activity with our allies, based on our shared interests across international security

**and stability, prosperity, human rights and the rule of law. The approach demands that, as a matter of**

choice, we will plan on the basis that we will work internationally from the outset; it will be the exception to

do things on a purely national basis. Defence engagement is an essential element in delivering this approach:

the relationships formed through persistent defence engagement activity provide the bedrock on which

capability planning and operational formations are founded.


_“[We are] a country that is…more outward-looking and more engaged with the world than ever before.”_

**Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP, Foreign Secretary[2]**


Defence will continue to offer credible military options in response to the risks identified in the National

Security Risk Assessment. By building in the international dimension of our planning from the start, we

will maximise our ability to work alongside partners who share our interests and values. This means

working closely with our allies and partners, and reflects the reality that Defence should expect to be

engaged in a large number of concurrent missions, almost all of which combine elements of hard and

soft power. It is not just an SDSR policy choice, but a necessity that we become more deliberate in our

international approach across the spectrum of Defence activity. The global defence network and the

defence engagement activity it plans and undertakes are thus pivotal to our ability to engage with the

world.

2 S h Ch h H 2 D b 2016


-----

Our international approach aims to deliver the national security objectives through developing strong
strategic bilateral and multilateral objectives. These are based on defence engagement and include
combined formations and capability cooperation, which are all underpinned by an active global defence
network.

**Strategic bilateral relationships. Strong bilateral relationships provide the basis on which we build all**
aspects of our international approach. With the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, we will maintain,
develop and prioritise strategic bilateral relationships so that the UK has a range of partners with whom
we can cooperate to achieve shared goals. We will use regional and country strategies to set priorities
and ensure our activities are aligned with our overall objectives. These strategies will guide decisions
on our defence engagement activity, including long-term commitments, such as loan and exchange
service personnel, and responsive activity, such as high- level international engagement and visits. The
list of important allies and partners with whom the UK wishes to maintain strong bilateral relationships is
extensive, though some of our security and defence relationships are particularly important.

The UK-US Defence relationship is the broadest, deepest and most advanced of any two countries, forged
through our shared values and beliefs. The SDSR 2015 confirmed the place of the US as our pre-eminent ally,
highlighting the unparalleled extent of UK-US cooperation on nuclear, intelligence, diplomacy, technology
and military capabilities which plays a major role in guaranteeing our national security.

The UK and France are the only European nations with the full range of military capabilities and the political
will to protect our interests globally: we therefore continue to build an exceptionally close defence and
security relationship together through the Lancaster House Treaty, covering operations, capability and joint
procurement.

**Germany is an essential partner given its economic power and growing influence on international security,**
and we are therefore working together to intensify our security and defence relationship.

As stated in the SDSR, Japan is our closest security partner in Asia; we have a strong and deepening defence
and security relationship based on shared values and common strategic interests.

We have an important and longstanding defence and security relationship with Australia that is similarly
based on shared values and interests and is reflected in substantial service-to-service relationships and deep
co-operation on science and technology, capability development and other areas.

**Multilateral relationships. Strengthening the rules-based international order is not something that any**
country can do on its own; multilateral institutions are needed.


**Operation ALVIN. Op Alvin was the UK’s support**
to the Maltese Government for the security of the
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and
the EU Migration Crisis Conference in November 2015.
HMS Bulwark provided the Command Platform for
the overall security operation. At the request of the
Maltese Government, the RAF provided assistance with
the Air Defence security plan. It deployed personnel
to enhance UK and Maltese senior commanders’
understanding and provided appropriate liaison
officers as was necessary to form strong working
relationships with the Maltese Armed Forces and
civilian Air Traffic Control agencies, ultimately leading
to a robust Air Policing system for both events.


-----

**NATO remains the bedrock of our national defence and at the heart of the UK’s international security**
collaboration: it is our primary multilateral relationship for collective security. With increasing threats within
and on Europe’s borders, NATO will remain the UK’s primary Defence alliance, and we will use NATO to drive
our ability to work together with our key allies. As examples of our work within NATO, the UK is providing
the lead NATO Response Force (NRF) and the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) in 2017. The UK
is also providing a defensive, combat capable battlegroup to Estonia, with contributions from France and
Denmark, and significant augmentation to our sister US battlegroup in Poland, on a persistent basis as part
of NATO’s enhanced Forward Presence commitment to its eastern flank.

Our forces will actively support the Estonian Armed Forces to maintain the deterrent effect of this activity,
and will participate in training and exercising across the Baltic States and Poland to enhance co-operation
and collaboration with the Armed Forces of allies based in the region. The UK’s decision to leave the
European Union reinforces the centrality of NATO to our security. We will ensure that we continue to
contribute to European security as we reconsider our future relationship with the European Union. We will
need to reinforce our bilateral relationships with our European allies.

Beyond Europe, the SDSR stresses the importance of expanding support to UN operations, notably
Peacekeeping and the Women, Peace and Security agenda, and we are already committing additional
peacekeepers to Somalia and South Sudan. Other key organisations we will continue to work with include
the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the Commonwealth, and we will
continue our close involvement with the Five- Eyes intelligence community.


**British Soldiers from 16 Air Assault Brigade take part in Exercise Swift Response in June 2016 in Poland and**
Germany, alongside US and Polish troops.


###### Defence engagement[12]

Defence engagement is the key means by which this international approach is delivered. As the non
combat use of military power, defence engagement is often delivered alongside other tools of national

power, sometimes as part of a named operation, and frequently as part of an alliance response or in

cooperation with partners. Against the backdrop of a complex and interdependent global community,

defence engagement’s contribution to the international approach is crucial to delivering our vision of a

**secure and prosperous UK with global reach and influence.**

**Combined formations ready to deliver combined action. The SDSR announced that a new Joint Force**

**2025 would be developed to tackle a wider range of more sophisticated potential adversaries and to**

increase the Armed Forces’ ability to work with the rest of government and internationally.


-----

Joint Force 2025 is designed to ensure Defence continues to offer credible military options to Government

and to provide defence engagement. Consequently, we expect defence to be persistently engaged around

the world, building relationships and capacity with our allies and partners, and influencing the way the world

develops by engaging in efforts to tackle risks upstream, and shaping the decisions of those who may be

hostile to us.

Where crises occur, Joint Force 2025 will act to mitigate the impact. This requires a great deal more of the

Armed Forces than combat operations, and that activity must be concerted with extensive diplomatic and

development interventions as part of our full spectrum approach, which will be International by Design.

The MOD, in partnership with the FCO, is constantly delivering defence engagement as part of the wider UK

government efforts to promote and protect UK interests, make crises less likely and to mitigate them when

they do occur.

Joint Force 2025 is a joint, integrated and combined force because the UK is unlikely to fight overseas

against a sophisticated adversary on its own. The ability to work within combined (international)

formations is as vital to our output as effective joint (tri-service) collaboration has become. This strand of

our international approach focuses on building and strengthening combined military formations that can

respond to emerging threats. Trust is crucial to this and we need to invest in the combined formations in

peace-time to build our interoperability. This involves training and exercising together, as well as sharing

doctrine, tactics and procedures. NATO is, and will remain, the key vehicle for delivering an interoperable

and integrated warfighting response. The UK will strengthen, or where necessary develop, appropriate

levels of interoperability with key allies in NATO through a robust exercise programme.

In addition, the UK is leading the work to develop the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) with Denmark,

**Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Norway which can operate as part of NATO or**

independently. The UK is working with France to further develop our bilateral UK/France Combined

**Joint Expeditionary Force (CJEF). The UK is also part of the NATO Response Force, standing NATO**

naval forces and other formations. There are potential threats to National Security which the UK

may choose to address through maintaining an ability to cooperate with likely partners where no

formal alliance exists; for example, exercising and training with partners in the Five Power Defence

**Arrangements, or** continued collaboration with the Gulf Cooperation Council nations.


**All three services participate in Five Power Defence Arrangements exercises; 4 Rifles conducting combined**
planning on Exercise Suman Warrior in New Zealand (2015) and Typhoons in Malaysia (2016).


-----

**Collaborative capabilities. To offer credible military options, the UK has decided to maintain a broad**

range of capability with wide utility. We will continue to collaborate in our capabilities with our key

allies and partners in delivering these options by combining expertise, sharing costs and enhancing

**interoperability. This strand considers two forms of capability collaboration: the first is in relation**

to equipment capability and its support; the second is in relation to capacity. Defence technology is

expensive and cost growth routinely exceeds inflation in other parts of the economy.

To mitigate the impact of cost, and share the risk of development, we will work with our main allies and

partners, principally the US and in Europe, in developing new capabilities wherever our requirements

align. Even where we choose not to collaborate in the development or production of new capabilities,

we will consider the benefits to interoperability in operating common equipment when buying or

selling internationally. The second strand of collaboration includes the non- equipment components of

capability. Through capacity building activity, including security sector reform, short-term training teams,

international defence training and exercises we will focus on building partner capability. This is a core

objective for defence engagement.

###### Global Defence Network

HMG’s global defence and diplomatic network – spanning 168 countries and territories – is crucial to our

approach. It gives us a permanent presence around the world, through which strong relationships are

built with allies, partners and others to develop, nurture and maintain strategic dialogue and cooperation.

With our allies and partners, this allows us to build coalitions to secure our shared interests. In turn, this

allows timely intervention to ensure that the rules-based international order evolves peacefully to account

for social and demographic change. The SDSR strengthened the global defence network with new

**British Defence Staffs (BDS) in Africa, the Gulf and Asia-Pacific.**


-----

###### Exercise EASTERN VENTURE 2016

Exercise EASTERN VENTURE was the overarching name given to the 2016 deployment of RAF aircraft,
including Typhoon, the RAF Aerobatic Team (the Red Arrows) and Voyager to the Middle East, South
Asia and East Asia, conducting a variety of activities in support of defence engagement and UK
national objectives. ‘Invincible Shield’, the first ever Republic of Korea (ROK), US and UK Combined Air
Exercise saw RAF Typhoons participate from Osan Air Base, ROK, marking the ROK’s first domestic air
combat manoeuvring exercise with a foreign nation other than the United States.

# SECTION THREE


### Defence Engagement Strategy: What we do


_“Through defence engagement, our Armed Forces help build our understanding_
_and increase our influence in regions that matter to us. This contributes to our cross-_
_government work overseas to build cooperation to tackle key challenges such as_
_instability, terrorism and extremism, serious and organised crime, and threats to_
_maritime security. Defence engagement also enables faster responses to crises, and_
_promotes our prosperity through support to defence exports. As part of this, we_
_will make defence engagement a funded, core MOD task for the first time ...”_

**SDSR 15**


Defence engagement uses Defence’s capacity, expertise and reputation for positive soft power influence

to support government strategies, working alongside other tools of government, particularly diplomacy

and development, and with international allies and partners. The SDSR acknowledged the vital role

played by defence engagement to achieve our National Security Objectives and made it a core funded

**Defence task so that it is prioritised against all MOD activity, including operations. It will now drive**

programmes and activity and be led by detailed regional and thematic strategies. Our international

approach enables us to achieve this through working alongside allies, building partner capability and

capacity, and supporting prosperity through our defence diplomacy and international training; all of

which is underpinned by credible fighting power, reputation and the British brand of excellence.

The thematic and country strategies developed by the National Security Council drive MOD’s regional

defence engagement strategies which provide clear and measurable objectives for each region and,

where necessary, sub-region and country.

###### Defence engagement objectives

The five strategic objectives for defence engagement are: develop understanding of national security

requirements; prevent conflict; develop capability, capacity and interoperability; promote prosperity; and

build and maintain access and influence. The diagram on page 2 provides further detail. They are each

directly linked to our national security objectives. The five defence engagement objectives guide planning

and are complementary to the specific objectives of the relevant regional strategy and country plan.

In most parts of the world, most of the time, defence engagement works alongside other government

activities, particularly broader security, diplomacy and development.


-----

It also promotes prosperity and the rules-based international order critical to maintaining UK values and

interests. In the parts of the world which do not experience this stability, defence engagement helps

further the government’s Building Stability Overseas Strategy to develop stability and re-introduce

order to prevent risks to the UK from emerging. For the occasions when the UK’s activities to prevent

instability and conflict do not succeed, even when the UK works with others, the MOD maintains forces

ready to respond with combat power should the UK decide to do so. However, even in this context,

defence engagement has a role in providing access, interoperability and the enduring relationships which

help to resolve the crisis and stabilise the situation.

###### Defence engagement activities

Defence engagement supports the National Security Objectives through four broad categories of activity:

**defence diplomacy, defence support to UK prosperity, building capability and enabling capability.**

Examples of the activities are given below, though they are frequently interdependent or contribute to

more than one of the national security objectives. For example, an overseas training exercise may enhance

protection through deterrence, project our influence and support prosperity.

**Defence diplomacy. As part of our broader bilateral relations, defence diplomacy builds and maintains**

our alliances and partnerships, secures influence and helps us to understand the environment in which

we operate. It is delivered by our global network of Defence Attachés, loan service, liaison and exchange

officers, supported by a targeted programme of international visits and staff talks.

**•** **High and senior level international engagement. This uses inward and outward visits by Ministers**

and senior military officers and civilians to build strategic relationships, alliances and coalitions,

ensuring cooperation, burden- sharing and interoperability. It is planned and directed from within the

MOD’s Strategic Headquarters and supports NSC strategies.

**•** **Wide ranging international engagement. We conduct a wide range of international engagement,**

through targeted programmes of engagement or specific events, such as staff talks. These

engagements support the full range of our national objectives, developing interoperability or logistic

agreements, supporting arms control or counter-proliferation initiatives, and promoting UK exports.

This engagement is enabled by bilateral Defence Cooperation Agreements and Memoranda of

Understanding.

**•** **Network engagement. We use our Defence Attachés and diplomats deployed around the world to**

build enduring relationships as part of our One HMG overseas network⁴.

As announced in the SDSR, we now have British Defence Staffs (BDS) in the Gulf, West Africa and

**Asia-Pacific, providing a regional defence focus. Each BDS is adapted to regional requirements.**

In the Gulf, the BDS will synchronise Defence activity, including the defence engagement outputs

delivered by our significant operational footprint in the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries, and will

seek greater coherence from our significant presence in the region.

In Asia-Pacific, the BDS will help co-ordinate and bring coherence to our growing defence engagement

activity in this important region. It will support the UK’s regional efforts to boost prosperity and

contribute to efforts to build defence institutions.

The new BDS in West Africa will oversee and bring coherence to a growing programme of UK military

advice and capacity building support as well as providing a regional Defence focus. UK training and

advisory support is helping Nigeria and its regional allies in the Lake Chad Basin and other parts of West

Africa to develop the capacity and capability needed to confront their security challenges, such as the

threat from Boko Haram-associated extremism. This support is being delivered through the resident

British Military Advisory and Training Team in Nigeria, and a network of liaison officers, operational

commitments, and short term training teams.

The MOD also has military loan service, exchange and liaison officers around the world, some embedded

within multilateral organisations such as the UN or NATO and others working with foreign governments

and commands. These provide vital influence, capacity building and understanding.

**Building capability. Working together on education, training and exercises can bolster allies’ and**

partners’ ability to play a greater role in strengthening global security while also benefiting UK forces. We

deliver this training in the following ways:

**•** **UK-based training and education. UK training and education is in high demand. All three services**

and Joint Forces Command provide training in the UK to improve individual and collective skills, in

anything from platoon tactics to cyber defence. We also provide high prestige education courses in

the UK, such as places on Initial Officer Training at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, the Royal

**Military Academy, Sandhurst, and RAF College, Cranwell, and deliver world-leading maritime**

training through the Royal Navy’s FOST (Flag Officer Sea-Training) organisation. Places offered

to international students at the Royal College of Defence Studies and other Defence Academy

courses are highly prized. Alumni from these countries frequently rise to senior government or

military posts, providing the UK with enduring influence and cementing our bilateral relations with

partners. Both training and education also increase understanding of UK and international norms on

priority areas such as human rights, transparency and the rules-based international order, while also

helping to develop enabling capabilities and institutions. We are delivering a greater range and

**volume of International Defence Training, and have increased the number of international places**

we offer on our highest profile courses by more than 10% in 2015-16 and 2016-17. We have piloted

a new International Senior Strategic Leadership Programme and International Strategic Planning

courses, introduced a Royal Navy International Officers’ Course, and increased the number or ratio of

international student places on a wide range of other courses.


**All three services conduct international defence training. The Royal Navy’s Flag Officer Sea Training is the**
world leader in Operational Sea Training, training 45 non-UK units between January 2013 and December 2015.
Furthermore, 79 units from 14 foreign nations exercised and trained in UK waters in Exercise JOINT WARRIOR in
2015, the largest military exercise in Europe.


-----

**•** **Overseas training and education. The SDSR announced our intention to increase the training**

we offer to our international partners. Overseas Training can deliver immediate improvements in

bilateral relations or in securing specific short-term goals, particularly in countries where the military

have a strong influence. This includes bespoke Short Term Training Teams (STTTs), which can offer

very specific and immediate benefits, such as helping to prepare forces to deploy on peacekeeping

missions or improving the capacity of partners to deal with internal security challenges. We also

have permanent overseas training hubs, such as the British Peace Support Teams in Africa, where

courses are delivered by the Defence Academy International Section and training is delivered in

conjunction with other government departments, other international partners and international

organisations. Training is prioritised by region or specific country; and thematically, including

building stability, counter terrorism, Counter-Improvised Explosive Devices (C-IEDs), migration and the

leadership and management of Defence.

Where military equipment is needed, or if there are significant force protection issues, the MOD will issue

direction to the Permanent Joint Headquarters or one of the other operational HQs to command the

activities.  The number of STTTs deployed overseas in 2016-17 has increased by 50% compared to 2015-16.

**•** **Defence Exercises. Besides delivering valuable training to partner and UK forces, exercises enable us**

to develop a better understanding of each other’s capabilities and approach, making us better able

to cooperate in response to future problems. Exercises overseas can also reassure partners about our

capability and intent, while simultaneously, if required, deterring adversaries and putting UK forces

close to where they may be needed.

**The Advanced Command and Staff Course (ACSC),**
conducted at the Joint Services Command and
Staff College (JSCSC) at the Defence Academy in
Shrivenham, is one of the world leaders in staff
training, bringing together military personnel and civil
servants in a combined learning environment.


**Lectures and syndicate work allow students to**
interact in a variety of situations, making the most of
individual and collective experience.


**Enabling Capability.** Support can be provided to any number of national or international organisations

as part of the delivery of effect required in response to an event or unfolding situation. We have increased

our commitment to UN peacekeeping through hosting the Defence Ministerial UN peacekeeping

conference in September 2016, and though establishing the UN Peacekeeping Joint Unit with the FCO

to jointly progress UN reform in Planning, Pledges and Performance. These “3Ps” are supported

by Security Council allies, and the UK is engaging through the UN and bilaterally to build leadership

and military effectiveness. Defence contributes to leadership of UN missions through secondment of

Staff Officers, principally in Africa, and British Armed Forces have supported the UN mission in Cyprus

(UNFICYP) for many years. However, the Government’s decision to send British Forces to UN missions in

**Somalia and South Sudan marked a new chapter in UK Defence policy and a new level of engagement**

which has not been undertaken for nearly 20 years. 2017 marks, in particular, the contribution of up to 400

Engineers and Medical personnel to improve the capabilities of the UN Mission in South Sudan. We are

also leading on the development of action plans such as those relating to Women, Peace and Security

and preventing sexual violence in conflict.

Our support to enabling others is broadly placed into two categories:

**•** **Enabling Partners. Where necessary, we use our specialist and niche capabilities – in areas such as**

provision of intelligence, reconnaissance, air lift, maritime patrol, medical support or assisting cyber

defence – to directly support partner nations and organisations. This may include UK investment in

joint projects or, exceptionally, the direct gifting of equipment.

**•** **Support to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations. Working closely with the**

**Defence support to UK prosperity. This is in large part delivered by defence engagement:**

**•** **Support to UK defence exports. Defence exports make a significant contribution to the UK’s**

national prosperity (worth £7.7Bn in 2015) and reinforce our key strategic international defence

relationships through increased military-military dialogue and interoperability. UK defence exports

also help secure the UK industrial base and maintain sovereign capabilities. The SDSR made support

to exports an integral part of MOD’s core business. Defence engagement makes an important

contribution to the understanding of economic opportunities in countries of interest and how to take

them forward. It supports government export campaigns, including through the work of its Defence

Attachés or attendance at exhibitions, and on occasion forms part of the package offered, including

training or maintenance support.

**Typhoon - there are a number of Typhoon export**
campaigns across Europe, the Middle East and South
East Asia. Defence exports support the wider objective
of internationalising our equipment capability
strategy and can underpin key strategic security
relationships.

**•** **Developing new technologies. Collaboration with allies and partners can help develop valuable new**

technologies and capabilities. We will be able to identify UK industrial and technological strengths

and opportunities for the export of complete systems, sub-systems, skills and know-how. We will also

be able to identify areas where UK in general, and defence in particular, would benefit from external

technological innovation, closer industrial partnerships and working with close allies. This approach

will need to involve all key stakeholders, both inside and outside defence.

**•** **Economic development for potential trading partners. More broadly, through its work on**

stabilisation and institutional capacity building, together with the Department for International

Development and others, defence engagement can help provide the security essential for economic

development. Through training and education on conflict prevention and broader stability and

combating corruption, defence engagement supports countries to develop the conditions necessary

for growth.

**•** **Supporting the security of trade routes and key natural resources through maritime security and**

protection of energy, water and mineral resources, helping international commerce and prosperity.

###### How activity is implemented

Through the establishment of new cross- government Joint Units (covering such areas as Euro
Atlantic Security Policy, International Counter-Terrorism Strategy, UN Peacekeeping and the Counter

Proliferation and Arms Control Centre), and more established ones such as the Stabilisation Unit, our

defence engagement activity is ever more integrated and aligned across government. Where Defence

contributes to key themes such as counter terrorism, Euro-Atlantic Security or overseas development,

defence engagement regional strategies follow from the National Security Council strategies, such as the

**Countering Terrorism Strategy (CONTEST), the Building Stability Overseas Strategy (BSOS), the**

**Migration Strategy and the Serious and Organised Crime Strategy.**

The MOD ensures that there is a balance between forces conducting defence engagement and those

preparing themselves for high-end war-fighting: that is, between making problems less likely to happen

and maintaining a contingent force ready to deal with them when they do occur.

We have nearly a thousand people, both military and civilian, working around the world in defence

engagement. This includes those in defence sections in 82 countries, who also cover a further 78

**countries; those working in long-term defence projects; in regional British Defence Staffs; and exchange**

officers, liaison officers and those in short-term training teams.

The SDSR announced the creation of a Defence Attaché and Loan Service Centre, which is now

delivering high quality training to the Defence Attaché network and to those working in our long-term

defence engagement projects abroad. The Centre’s courses focus on integrating defence engagement

within a ‘whole of government’ context and help to prepare our people in the best possible way for

the complex environment in which defence engagement is now delivered. We have also established an

**Armed Forces Defence Engagement career stream which recognises the importance of this field of**

work for defence.

The resource committed to defence engagement is greater than ever before. Central MOD funding for

defence engagement, including programmes and the Defence Attaché Network, is currently around

**£80m and rising over the next four years. However, demand driven by regional strategies and unexpected**

events which require a response will still invariably exceed supply. Defence engagement is funded

centrally by the MOD; by the single Service and Joint Forces Command; and defence programmes

supporting broader government strategies are also funded from the cross-government Conflict, Stability

**and Security Fund (CSSF), currently around £56m. As a result, our approach to fragile and conflict-**

affected countries is coherent and strengthened by this whole of Government approach.

Defence engagement is prioritised based on a long term view of the UK’s objectives. Priorities are

expressed both thematically and geographically.

These priorities are regularly reviewed and take into account the feasibility of working in particular areas

and achieving impact and the importance of a country for wider Government objectives beyond defence.

Monitoring and evaluation constantly inform prioritisation decisions, as resources must be allocated as

efficiently as possible and where they can have most effect.

Defence communications support the engagement strategy by explaining Defence’s role overseas

to protect and promote the UK’s interests and values through security and promoting prosperity. We

emphasise the role of our UK Armed Forces working alongside our allies in Europe and across the World.

We work together with other UK government departments, including the Department for International

Development and the Department for International Trade, to promote Britain’s place in the world,

supporting the #GlobalBritain campaign, and demonstrating the British values and standards that the

Armed Forces embody.
