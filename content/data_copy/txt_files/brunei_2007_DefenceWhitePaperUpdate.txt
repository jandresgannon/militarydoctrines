###### F o r e w o r d

Alhamdulillah, I am greatly privileged at the outset, to convey, our heartfelt gratitude to His Majesty the Sultan
and Yang Di-Pertuan of Negara Brunei Darussalam for his blessing and consent to release another important
publication of the Defence White Paper Update 2007. His Majesty’s inspiration and guidance have given us
strong motivation and determination to work towards the completion of the review of the 2004 publication every
two to three years.

The Defence White Paper Update 2007: Shaping the Force Today, identifies specific planning in short to medium
terms towards defending our interests as a sovereign nation as well as in promoting a more active regional
outreach. The Paper puts more emphasis on strengthening interaction, developing response mechanisms to
major security crises and enhancing the RBAF’s participation and capability towards regional and international
peace support and humanitarian relief missions.

The main focus is on delivering multi-tasked armed forces capable of responding to any eventualities, undertaking
a wide range of challenges (including natural disaster relief and support operations) more rapidly, effectively and
jointly, with sufficient levels of readiness, interoperability and mobility. Undoubtedly, these are difficult challenges
but not impossible to address, given the commitment and experiences our armed forces have gained after more
than forty years of its establishment.

In order to succeed, we equally need to develop high levels of professionalism from within the force, maximize
the forces capacity to operate collaboratively with national and international partners as well as enhance the
networking of our force elements. We should continue to use national assets as force multipliers and identify and
give priority to key capability elements best matched to achieving the desired policy and operational outcomes.

Our personnel must strive harder in order to undertake even bigger roles both domestically and internationally.
Our commitment in encouraging continuous life long learning and in developing our institutions as centres of
excellence, provide more opportunities to our personnel to acquire better training and new skills both internally
and overseas. Both the Supreme Commander of RBAF and the RBAF Scholarships, offered to high achieving
students to study at top universities and educational institutions, would produce potential leaders for the Ministry
of Defence and the Royal Brunei Armed Forces.

In the efforts to contribute to our national economic agenda, we must ensure the successful realisation of our
policy, including the development of our defence industry. Initiatives under the industrial policy will help to
promote economic diversification, create employment opportunities and enhance skills development in Brunei
Darussalam. It is also hoped to maximize the amount of existing defence support activities, while also seeking
dual use opportunities for defence skills to be used in civil industries and vice versa. Equally important is our
desire to play an enhanced role in ASEAN activities by contributing niche capabilities. Our emphasis on investing
in new technology and technological know-how should pave the way for the creation of a more practical, modern
and better-equipped Armed Forces.

At this juncture, I would like to sincerely thank those who have contributed to this update, especially those who
have participated in long but fruitful discussions held over the past few months.

May I take this opportunity once again, on behalf of the Ministry of Defence, to avail to His Majesty the Sultan
and Yang Di-Pertuan of Negara Brunei Darussalam our continued commitment and support to His Majesty’s
wise leadership, which brings about well-being to the people of Negara Brunei Darussalam. We pray to Allah the
Almighty to bless His Majesty so that he may continue to provide our beloved Negara Brunei Darussalam with
strong leadership towards achieving success in our future endeavours.

###### F o r e w o r d

First and foremost, I would like to take this opportunity to record my sincere appreciation and thanks to the
reviewing team who have been working very hard to produce the Defence White Paper Update 2007, as a revised
paper to the Defence White Paper 2004 - Defending the Nation’s Sovereignty.

The 2004 Defence White Paper was officially launched on the auspicious occasion of the 43rd Anniversary of the
RBAF. This year as we celebrate our 46th Anniversary, we are privileged to witness the launching of the Defence
White Paper Update 2007 by His Majesty the Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam, the Minister
of Defence and the Supreme Commander of the RBAF, which is significant in its own right. The launching of
the Paper is even more meaningful as it coincides with the Inaugural Brunei Darussalam International Defence
Exhibition and Forum (BRIDEX) 2007. With these initiatives, I expect such an invigorating progress will continue
to inspire our future commitments by compelling all of us, particularly our armed forces personnel, to endeavour
in achieving our missions and goals.

Globalization, modern information technology and expansion in connectivity and interdependency between people
and nations have created an international community without borders. This borderless phenomenon, however,
has produced challenges on the international community. Among the notable themes are the unexpected nature
of non-conventional and transnational threats from terrorism, crimes and large magnitude of natural calamities.
These developments have in turn provided an ample opportunity for the creation of a framework to integrate and
cooperate among nations widely, including in the field of defence and security to address those multi-dimensional
challenges.

The Defence White Paper Update 2007 is produced and designed to specify the future planning and management
activities that the RBAF will undertake in ensuring its effective and efficient delivery of its services to the country and
government both in defending Brunei Darussalam and in addressing other challenges. In line with the aspiration
set out in the 2004 Defence White Paper, the 2007 Update has provided clear directions for officers and personnel
of the RBAF in carrying out their multifaceted duties. This Update has similarly taken into account lessons learnt
from our participation in the International Monitoring Team in Mindanao and Aceh Monitoring Mission as well as in
humanitarian missions in Aceh and Yogyakarta in order to assess the level of our overall capability.

Aspiring to produce a pragmatic operational outcome, the Defence White Paper Update 2007 has given further
emphasis on how best to transform the RBAF into a flexible, reliable and credible force. On top of that, the
RBAF force structure is also streamlined to ensure the RBAF be able to execute its defined roles effectively not
only within but also with other agencies, as we enhance our operational theater to the wider spectrum involving
national, regional and international settings.

In conclusion, it is so desired that the men and women serving in the Ministry of Defence and the RBAF continue
to equip themselves with the necessary knowledge and total commitment in fulfilling our roles and responsibilities
as set in the Defence White Paper Update 2007. It is very important for the Commanders and Directors and
the whole leadership of the RBAF to avail their strong support and determination to implement what has been
stipulated in the Defence White Paper Update 2007, and cascading down those policies and strategic directions
to our subordinates.

###### F o r e w o r d

Alhamdulillah, with the grace of Allah, the most merciful and most compassionate, for it is with His gracious
blessings that our country and people continues to enjoy security, peace and prosperity.

The Ministry of Defence in delivering effective capabilities, contribute to the national agenda and nation building,
continues to pursue new programmes and initiatives that guarantees our nation remain secured and protected.

The release of the 2004 Defence White Paper had elaborated on our policy responses to the volatile security
environment and the implications for Bruneí Darussalam’s defence posture, specifically our defence planning,
capability development and force structure. In realizing the policy, the Royal Brunei Armed Forces had undertaken
active participation in regional missions, particularly in peace support, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief
efforts. This is not only a reflection of the country’s renewed commitment to regional efforts but also mark a
turning-point to the country’s aspiration to participate in future global missions.

This Defence White Paper Update focuses on Bruneí Darussalam’s immediate defence strategies, capability
consolidation and capacity development, and interoperability with national security agencies. The Update
reiterated the significant importance of ensuring flexibility across defence, from our people, structures, equipment,
rebalancing of capabilities, expenditures and priorities. Still recognizing the multi-role of RBAF, our course of
development is more focused on prioritization in the short term. In order to fulfill its tasks, RBAF needs to be
geared with the right capability warranting sufficient levels of readiness, mobility, interoperability and sustainability
to realize the desired ambitions at the national, regional and global levels.

We acknowledge that resources need to be directed into the right investments in order to reap the right benefits.
Rebalancing of priorities and development at all levels is compulsory to ensure the Royal Brunei Armed Forces
remain robust, responsive and resource efficient to address and respond to current and most challenging
situations facing Brunei Darussalam.

In light of the volatile and unpredictable nature of security challenges, the venture for effective defence is an
ongoing process. Threats come in various forms, conventional and non-conventional. Our survivability ratio is
dependent on our competency, capability and preparedness to counter whatever security challenges confronting
the nation in both the immediate and long term. We should not only merely be sufficiently equipped but also be
proficient in sustaining and maintaining our technological strength.

Modernisation of the RBAF remains the final outcome we aspire to achieve. Prior to that, the crucial prerequisite
is to invest in recruitment and trainings for the personnel, consolidation of existing capabilities, prioritise capability
procurements and improve operational coordination.

I strongly believe that the Defence White Paper Update will further clarify our priorities for development in the
immediate timeframe ensuring coherence, better alignment between policy and operational implementation and
modernization progress.

Defence planning is dynamic. Potential security challenges must be continually monitored,
policies and strategies reviewed to ensure their appropriateness, operational activities
carefully targeted to meet priority national and cooperative security objectives and force
development programmes checked to ensure the timely and resource efficient delivery
of key capabilities. Priorities may change with little warning.

Brunei Darussalam’s Defence White Paper 2004, Defending the Nation’s Sovereignty,
recognized these realities. While establishing a clear direction for the nation’s security
planning, it recommended the nation’s strategic circumstances be reviewed every 2 - 3

years and that progress with implementing its policy and capability recommendations
should be similarly revisited, compatible with the White Paper’s longer term objectives.


Those judgments have proven wise. While Brunei Darussalam’s own immediate
security prospects remain sound, the wider Southeast Asian region has faced important
challenges. Natural disasters and illegal transnational activities, domestic instability and
insurgency, and the continuing shadow of global terrorism have all affected the region.
The need for nations to work closely together in both policy initiatives and operational
responses has been given added impetus.

The Royal Brunei Armed Forces (RBAF) have contributed to peace missions in both
Cambodia and the Philippines and to humanitarian relief efforts in Aceh and Yogyakarta
in response to the tsunami and earthquake devastation. They have also assisted in
monitoring the implementation of the peace agreement in Aceh.


The Defence Update 2007, Shaping the Force Today, responds to those developments.
Within the Defence White Paper’s overall policy framework, it identifies the key changes
that have occurred and establishes the immediate priorities to guide the development
and employment of the nation’s defence capabilities over the next 3 - 5 years.

In the contemporary world, national defence is not simply marshalling resources against
a possible but remote threat in the longer term. It requires the active management of
an increasing broad range of security challenges, including active cooperation with
other national agencies and the nation’s security partners. Protecting the nation against
military pressure will always be at the core of Brunei Darussalam’s defence policy. In the
contemporary environment, that is only part of defence’s role in securing the nation’s
future.

Brunei Darussalam’s Defence White Paper 2004, Defending the Nation’s Sovereignty,
painted a concise, yet comprehensive picture of the key factors shaping the security
of states in the new millennium together with the more specific dynamics affecting
stability and development in the Asia-Pacific. It was a complex and uncertain outlook
with traditional security concerns co-existing uneasily with the new challenges of global
terrorism and transnational crime.

The essential features of the strategic landscape have not changed. The threat of terrorist
attack remains the most immediate security concern. Transnational crime including


piracy, people smuggling and arms trafficking continues unabated.

In the broader region, major power relations remain stable and there are good prospects
that this will continue. ASEAN provides the essential framework for stability and
development in Southeast Asia and is the key instrument for cooperative engagement
with major external powers. More robust economic and political links are being forged with
both Northeast Asia under the ASEAN Plus Three arrangements and other international
partners. Issues that may lead to strategic tensions are generally being approached with
restraint.


Several new dynamics are, however, changing planning priorities. The impact of the
Indian Ocean tsunami and the subsequent earthquake in Indonesia highlighted how
dramatically environmental disasters can impact on national security, affecting neighbours
without warning or cause. The current debate on global warming suggests that such
instances may become more prevalent. Together with operational experience in Aceh,
Mindanao and Cambodia, they highlight the breadth and immediacy of contemporary
security challenges and growing expectations of a cooperative regional response.

From a planning perspective, the indiscriminate nature, potential scale and immediacy
of these challenges demand ready response capabilities, professionally trained, fully
equipped, able to be deployed at very short notice and structured for both multi-agency
and multi-national cooperation. Effective disaster management – whether in response
to natural causes or a terrorist attack – has become an essential ingredient in a nation’s
security capabilities.


Importantly, these security challenges draw potentially on both combat and combat
support capabilities. Defence’s primary focus must always be the protection of the nation


-----

against threats of force to its security. At the same time, as a large, organised body of
trained manpower and resources under command, it remains the key national asset
when civil resources are exhausted. That additional dimension of the armed forces’ role
has a new and immediate significance.

The second new dynamic is the increasingly complex intersection between broader
international security trends and regional and domestic stability. The communications
revolution has fostered greater awareness of developments in other parts of the world.


Much of the answer lies in enhanced intelligence exchanges, the control of unauthorised
transnational movement and the maintenance of a stable domestic environment. At the
same time, a preparedness to assist in tackling the root causes of these divisive forces


-----

in the international system will be important. The guidance and commitment of the United
Nations as a neutral and independent arbitrator will be central to that process. All nations
have an interest and an investment in the success of its peace support operations.

The challenges of development have increased domestic instability and raised the
prospect of state failure, particularly among several smaller, less developed nations in
the region. The preparedness of neighbouring nations to support national governments
in managing those pressures will be important to the stability and progress of the region
as a whole. Operational commitments could be expected to be cooperative, involve the
consent of the different parties, and be undertaken under regional groupings, the United
Nations or possibly the Organisation of Islamic Conference leadership.


-----

# 03
###### R e f i n i n g D e f e n c e P o l i c y


-----

Responding to the new strategic dynamics does not require a change to Brunei
Darussalam’s overall national security objectives. They remain, as set out in the Defence
White Paper 2004, Defending the Nation’s Sovereignty, to:

  - support the maintenance of stability and cohesion within the nation;



- protect national interests in adjacent maritime areas;

- reinforce the integrity of the nation’s borders;



- enhance the national capacity to counter terrorism;

- cooperate within the ASEAN context on issues of shared concern and supporting
the stability of neighbours;



- further regional security cooperation through dialogue, increased transparency
and crisis management; and



  - develop a robust and flexible defence capability able to handle the complex set of
current tasks while retaining the capacity to deter aggression.

Achieving those objectives will continue to require a comprehensive approach to security
drawing upon all instruments of national policy, including political, social, economic and
military, to promote stability and protect the nation and its interests.


Within that framework, however, the changes that have occurred subsequent to
the publication of the Defence White Paper 2004 introduce a more specific planning
focus. In the short to medium term timeframe addressed in this Defence Update, those
developments give significant additional emphasis to:

  - promoting a more robust regional security dialogue to better understand and,
where appropriate, develop cooperative policies and responses towards those


shared strategic challenges;

- developing appropriate mechanisms to facilitate cooperation in responding to any
major security crisis that may arise with little or no warning;


-----

- significantly enhancing the capacity and availability of the Royal Brunei Armed
Forces (RBAF) to contribute to those cooperative regional operations as well as

priority national tasks; and



- as a committed member of the international community, strengthening the nation’s
ability to make a modest yet credible contribution to wider United Nation’s peace


support and humanitarian relief operations.

Importantly, when developing the RBAF’s capacity to contribute, the aim will be to provide
government with options which are not only credible in operational terms but are flexible
enough for commitments to be tailored closely to the policy objectives it is seeking to
achieve. As a neutral, independent player with a competent military force and broadly
based international connections, Brunei Darussalam is well placed to play a constructive
role in many circumstances.


-----

Pursuing these more immediate strategic objectives does not lessen the responsibility
of the nation to protect its own sovereignty. Strengthening the RBAF’s ability to exercise
control over its borders and in adjacent maritime areas is essential to national security.
Maintaining stability and security at home is also an important foundation for the nation’s
wider regional and international contribution.


-----

###### E n h a n c i n g R e g i o n a l C o o p e r a t i o n

Traditionally, regional security cooperation among the ASEAN states focused at the
multilateral level on developing transparency of policy and planning and building trust.
The publication of defence policy documents and the conduct of regular meetings to
review security developments have been its key elements. The ASEAN Regional Forum
(ARF) and the semi-official Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific continue
to be important forums for interaction.

More practical cooperation has been primarily bilateral, whether between regional
nations or with international security partners. The emphasis has been on developing


fundamental military skills within individual Services.

Brunei Darussalam has been no exception. It undertakes a range of cooperative training
activities with neighbouring states and other strategic countries.


The impact of international terrorism has, however, been an important catalyst for more
formal multilateral cooperation among regional nations. The Declaration of ASEAN
Concord II, signed at Bali in October 2003, provide the framework for establishing an
ASEAN Security Community (ASC). This would:

… fully utilize the existing institutions and mechanisms within ASEAN with a view to
strengthening national and regional capacities to counter terrorism, drug trafficking,
trafficking in persons and other transnational crimes; and … work to ensure that the
Southeast Asian Region remains free of all weapons of mass destruction.


Planning has commenced in each of these areas. The Vientiane Agreement in July 2005
provided the framework for regional disaster management and emergency response.
Most recently, ASEAN has agreed to commit assets and resources for the ASEAN
Humanitarian Assistant and Disaster Relief (HADR) Stand-by Arrangement Initiative and
in January 2007, an agreement was reached on the ASEAN Convention on Counter
Terrorism. The ARF is also pursuing plans to facilitate civil-military cooperation in natural
disasters and to prevent cyber attacks on critical infrastructure.

From a defence perspective, the key development has been the Inaugural ASEAN
Defence Ministers Meeting (ADMM) in May 2006. It is the highest ministerial defence
and security consultative and cooperative mechanism within ASEAN and establishes a


-----

framework under which to pursue more practical multilateral defence planning. It also
provides overall direction to existing military-to-military interactions including the regular
Informal Meetings between the ASEAN Chiefs of Defence Force, Chiefs of the Single
Services and Chiefs of Intelligence.

In light of recent operational experience and the priority strategic roles identified in this
Defence Update, it will be important to develop a more practical and focused element
to this cooperation, both bilaterally and multilaterally. The principal areas to be explored
include:



- developing Status of Force Agreements (SOFA) appropriate to prospective tasks;

- compatible command and control arrangements;


-----

  - commonality in communication and logistics systems and procedures;

  - structures for, and shared experience in participating in, multilateral headquarters
at both the operational and tactical levels;

  - shared training in the specific tactical skills required in peace support and
humanitarian relief operations; and

  - joint maritime patrol operations.

The capability enhancements set out in this Defence Update will significantly increase
the capacity of the RBAF to engage in these areas of cooperation.

###### D e l i v e r i n g C a p a b i l i t y O u t c o m e s


-----

The timely acquisition and operational availability of key capabilities within the RBAF
is an essential component in achieving the nation’s security objectives. The Defence
White Paper 2004 provided an overall framework for developing those capabilities and
introduced clear operational roles to guide that process. The emphasis which they placed
on surveillance and response operations, the capacity to maintain a presence in (and, if
necessary, protect) key areas, and the command, control and communications to support
joint operations remain directly relevant to today’s challenges.

Within that context, the new strategic challenges and recent operational experience added

several additional factors that establish priorities for the development and employment of
the force in the short to medium term. In particular, the armed forces must be:



- closely matched to national policy objectives;

- available at short notice and able to be deployed quickly, including at distance;

- flexible in the variety of tasks they can undertake across a range of transnational,
natural disaster and peace operations;

- credible in performing specific roles yet able to be sustained on operations for
some time;

- potentially able to undertake several tasks concurrently; and

- interoperable with regional and international security partners.


For all but the largest powers, that can be an extremely daunting agenda and not easy to
achieve within available national resources. The keys to success lie in:

  - maximising the armed force’s capacity to operate cooperatively with other national
assets and security partners;

  - identifying, and giving priority to, the key capability elements best matched to
achieving the desired policy and operational outcomes;

  - networking all force elements to promote unity of command, common situational
awareness, adaptability in the employment of force assets, and joint operational

concepts;

  - the smart and well-targeted use of wider national assets as force multipliers,
particularly for non-combat and support roles; and

  - promoting a high level of professionalism within the force.


-----

Accordingly, development of the RBAF in the short to medium term will focus on:

- command, control, communications, computing and intelligence (C4I);

- specific capability enhancements maximising operational output for priority strategic


tasks;

- a coherent strategy for national support; and

- progressive introduction of a comprehensive training structure.

Capability enhancement is not simply the acquisition of additional platforms. It
encompasses all aspects of capability including organisational change, personnel and
training, and supply and support arrangements.


The Defence White Paper 2004 continues to provide the guidance for the longer term,
overall development of the force to protect the nation and its interests.


-----

# 06
###### N e t w o r k i n g T h e F o r c e


-----

The effective networking of assets is the essential element of modern military operations.
Advances in communications and processing technologies enable the real-time
transmission of messages and data, detailed command and control of operations whether
at the strategic or tactical level and, when linked to modern surveillance systems, the
development of a comprehensive picture of the operational environment.

Command, Control, Communications, Computing and Intelligence (C4I) is, however, far
more than technology. It is about matching that technology to clearly defined command and
control arrangements, developing appropriate doctrine and procedures, timely analysis
of inputs, and informed dissemination to operational commanders. Recent deployments
by the RBAF confirm not only the essentiality of a joint force approach to operations but
the breadth of forces and agencies with which it must potentially interact.


In the new security agenda, operations will frequently be multi-agency and/or multinational. Forces may be simultaneously responsible to national command and coalition
requirements. The nature of interaction may vary from simple information exchanges,
tactical coordination and routine supply and support through to higher level strategic
decision making. Even relatively small force elements may be deployed into quite
complex C4I environments. Clarity and simplicity of national arrangements is essential if
the advantages of networking are to be fully realised.


-----

To achieve this, several key initiatives are to be undertaken:

  - the Joint Operations Centre (JOC) is to become the single, integrated operations
centre for the RBAF. In addition to planning and directing deployments, it will be


the focal point for operational coordination with other forces and agencies – whether

national or international;

- in addition, the JOC will have responsibility for the development of joint doctrine
and procedures, over sighting the force communications architecture, and

expanding the current joint, national and multilateral exercise programs; and

- each services, together with RBAF Support Services, will provide a cadre of
operational planning staff to the JOC while retaining a smaller training and


coordination element for the direction of single service activities.

With the introduction of the new tactical radios, the RBAF will be well placed to conduct
joint operations across the Services both strategically and tactically. An early priority
for the JOC will be to review the compatibility of RBAF communication procedures and
technologies with relevant national agencies and key security partners. Strengthening
the JOC’s ability to fuse and interpret the additional information should be integral to all
proposals to enhance surveillance capabilities.


-----

# 07
###### B u i l d i n g A F l e x i b l e, D e l i v e r a b l e D e f e n c e


-----

While networking is undoubtedly the key to direction, coherence and resource efficiency,
the effectiveness of military operations depends on providing both the tactical picture to
inform that network and the capabilities to carry out the orders it conveys. Amid the broad
spectrum of potential RBAF operations, the challenge is to select the mix of capabilities
that maximise operational flexibility while remaining tightly focused on delivering the
nation’s key policy objectives.

The Defence White Paper 2004 provided a clear path for achieving those objectives
over the longer term. The changing security environment and the recent operational


commitments guide the first steps along that path. They are to:

  - enhance the surveillance and response capabilities of the RBAF, particularly in the
maritime environment;

  - maximise the flexibility of the land force through strengthening its ability to tailor
forces to the specific operational task; and

  - provide the necessary mobility and logistics to support the timely deployment and
sustainability of force elements in a range of operational environments.


The specific initiatives and their implications for each of the services are set out below.
The priorities they establish will shape the capability development program for the next
five years.


-----

**ROYAL BRUNEI LAND FORCE (RBLF)**

The requirement to deploy at short notice, and frequently to sustain, a land force presence
is essential to Brunei Darussalam’s ability to provide a consistent and valued contribution
to cooperative security operations. An organised body of professional soldiers under
command can, in addition to providing a local security presence, undertake a wide
spectrum of organisational and support roles.


The RBAF’s three Infantry Battalions provide, in addition to essential national security
tasks, with options for contributing to the range of potential commitments from disaster
relief and humanitarian operations to border patrolling and peace support. They have the
capacity to sustain a modest commitment to multinational operations at distance.

The objective in the short to medium term will be to develop the capacity to sustain up to
a company group at distance in support of cooperative security operations. Alternatively,
two smaller units might be deployed concurrently to different locations. This will involve:



- providing the appropriate training to hone the skills of the individual soldier to
operate in complex environments;

- developing a comprehensive suite of equipment including appropriate weaponry
and protective clothing, tactical communications, mobility assets and immediate

area day-night surveillance; and

- requiring each infantry battalion to maintain a high readiness platoon able to be
deployed at short notice.


-----

The training of junior to middle level officers, including the skills of working in a multilateral framework and a civil society context, will be important given the likelihood of
small unit operations.

The establishment of a fourth infantry battalion remains an important goal in the longer
term and, when developed, would support the deployment of a larger ground force
contribution. The more immediate priority, however, is to enhance the land force’s ability
to optimise deployments for the particular task and in accordance with the Government’s
specific strategic objectives.


That flexibility will be achieved by strengthening progressively certain specialist
capabilities within the Support Battalion, transforming them into strategic assets within the
land force. They will provide flexible building blocks which may be combined with infantry
formations to strengthen the latter’s ability to perform certain roles or offer independent
niche capabilities within a multinational force.

The key areas for development will be:



- to transform one of the current infantry battalion into a mechanised battalion.

- formation of a second engineer squadron. In the short term, the RBAF will have
the capacity to deploy an engineer quick response team to contribute to immediate

survivability operations. When development is complete, a larger deployable

construction capability will be available, a contribution sustainable over a longer


period, or several engineering tasks might be undertaken concurrently;

- creation of a land force reconnaissance platoon. This will complement existing
battalion assets and undertake information gathering in preparation for any

overseas deployments. Its existence will allow the patrolling capabilities of any


land force deployment to be strengthened; and

- transfer of the existing Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) capability to the new
engineer squadron to broaden its skills and flexibility together with the establishment

of a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Explosives (CBRE) capability within

it. Both developments will enhance the squadron’s ability to operate effectively in


a complex task environment.

Feasibility studies about strengthening fire power support should continue but its


introduction, if supported, will only occur in the longer term.


-----

**ROYAL BRUNEI NAVY (RBN)**

The imperatives to enhance the RBAF’s maritime capabilities in the short to medium
term are twofold. They are:



- the need to replace existing vessels which are expensive to maintain and lack
the necessary operational flexibility to protect fully the nation’s interests in adjacent

maritime areas; and

- the overlap between those tasks and Brunei Darussalam’s ability to make an
effective contribution to the region’s shared interest in maintaining maritime safety


and security, including the prevention of illegal transnational movement.

The overarching strategic objective is to establish a layered series of surveillance and
response capabilities that maximise the nation’s ability to control its adjacent maritime
areas. Early acquisition is important. To achieve the best mix of capabilities within
available resources, a careful balance will be established between platform numbers,
required performance, sensor and weapons fit, and cost.


-----

The priority requirement is to acquire several patrol vessels able to operate effectively
out to the limits of the nation’s Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ), respond quickly to
specific sightings, board suspect vessels and, if necessary, sustain a maritime presence.
To meet that need, there will be an initial procurement of patrol vessels. These will be:

  - no more than 80 metres in length, with a self defence capability and the ability to
withstand sea conditions within the region; and

  - of a proven commercial design and with the flexibility to be reconfigured for
optimised performance in key roles, including surveillance and response, as a


tactical command and control centre, and to deploy elements of the land force.

The new vessels will significantly enhance the RBAF’s capacity to participate in regional
maritime control planning and exercises and perform essential maritime safety tasks.
To support early acquisition and ensure affordability (including overall life cycle costs),
either private finance initiatives or leasing of the vessels will be considered.


Closer to shore, speed of response is particularly important whether for maritime safety,
search and rescue or intercepting suspect vessels. Such operations are essential to
protecting the nation’s maritime interests, including in the vicinity of offshore resource
platforms. They support the activities of other national maritime enforcement agencies
and are essential to the nation’s ability to cooperate with its neighbours in controlling
transnational threats.

To provide this more immediate layer of maritime security, a small fleet of fast patrol
boats will be acquired. These will replace the existing Missile Gun Boats and Coastal
Patrol Boats, enhancing operational performance while cutting operating and support
costs. They will be up to 40 metres in length, equipped with an all-weather day and night
surveillance capability, and be capable of transporting a boarding party or small troop
formation.


Replacement of the existing RBAF capabilities for shallow water and riverine transport
and interception will be undertaken subsequently. Those tasks overlap most directly with
other national agencies and alternative deployment options exist including Air Force’s
rotary wing capability.

Safe navigation is essential to national operations and international shipping movements.
It highlights the need for much more comprehensive hydrographic and oceanographic
information on the nation’s EEZ. RBAF will work closely with relevant government
agencies to develop an independent national capability in this area.

**ROYAL BRUNEI AIR FORCE (RBAirF)**

Capable air assets are essential to the effectiveness of a networked force across the
spectrum of potential RBAF operations. They can provide extended range and area
coverage, speed of response, and the flexibility to deploy and support the land force,
including tactical mobility and re-supply. Aerial surveillance is the foundation for the
control of maritime areas and the monitoring of national boundaries.


The core of air force’s current capability is the tactical surveillance and mobility offered
by its fleet of rotary wing aircraft. The existing Blackhawk helicopters offer a valuable
capability in terms of speed, tactical range, payload and the deployment of troops.
Enhancing their night surveillance capability should be pursued as a matter of priority.
The fleet of Bell 212’s complements this but has more limited carrying capacity and is
reaching end of its operational requirement.

Maintaining the RBAF’s rotary wing capacity will be critical to overall operational
effectiveness in meeting present and future strategic tasks, both nationally and within the
region. Plans should be developed for the phased replacement of the older helicopters
in the medium to longer term. Cost effectiveness, including through-life support, may be
enhanced by the acquisition of a common platform, albeit with a flexible sensor fit, and
the use where possible of commercial rather than full military specifications.


The more immediate priorities for air force are to:

  - expand its current surveillance envelope, particularly in maritime areas but also
over the more difficult land border terrain;

  - develop the capacity for the rapid deployment, and if necessary re-supply, of land
force units including for regional security operations; and


-----

  - Improved conditions of service to attract and retain qualified pilots.

Strategic airlift for larger scale and/or more distance force deployments should be
provided either commercially or through agreement with other security partners.


The additional capabilities to be acquired to deliver that enhanced operational performance
will be:

  - the acquisition of an additional maritime patrol/fixed wing transport aircraft to
complement the single CN235 currently available; and

  - development of a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) capability configured for both
maritime and land surveillance.


The additional fixed wing aircraft will significantly increase overall operational availability
and flexibility. It should be:

  - of commercial design, capable of patrolling to the limits of the nation’s EEZ, and
reconfigurable at short notice for surveillance or to deploy up to platoon of infantry

and their essential equipment or a mixed stores load;

  - equipped with an all-weather, day/night capable surveillance sensor suite, palate
mounted to support both operational flexibility and ease of maintenance; and

  - supportable as far as possible by the national aviation industry.


A lease arrangement with a commercial provider may be possible, defraying the initial
cost and providing for a replacement capability during maintenance downtime.

UAVs have the advantage of being a relatively simple platform that can be equipped with
a range of sensors and, if required, loiter at extended ranges. They should be fitted with
an all weather, day/night surveillance capability for both maritime and land operations.
The UAV’s speed of response, area of coverage and flexibility mesh closely with the
RBAF’s new joint, networked approach to operations. It is, however, a new capability and
planning must include the early development of concept of employment together with the
associated control and support infrastructure.


Planning for the future upgrading of air defence capabilities and the possible introduction
of a Light Fighter Aircraft, while not a capability priority in the short to medium term,
should continue to be pursued.

Achieving the capability and operational outcomes identified in this Defence Update
in a resource efficient manner will be demanding. Capability must be appreciated in a
holistic sense taking into account not only platforms and personnel but the full range of
logistic support, defence-related infrastructure, management systems and training that
underpin operational effectiveness. The wide spectrum of potential tasks implied by the
new security agenda reinforces the need for a well targeted support infrastructure.

Initiatives taken to improve Defence management following the Defence White Paper
2004 will support this process. They include:



  - establishment of the Defence Strategic Management Board, Force Capability
Development Unit, Inspectorate Unit, RBAF Religious Unit and Public Private

Partnership Unit;

  - introduction of the integrated 3 - 5 years force development plan and utilisation of
the Balanced Scorecard;

  - development of specialised courses such as the Executive Development
Program; and

  - establishment of the Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Institute of Defence and
Strategic Studies

The current force development plan will be reviewed to ensure its priorities reflect the
conclusion in this Defence Update.


**Logistic Support**

Logistic planning must be developed to satisfy the new requirements for:



  - higher levels of readiness;

  - the increased likelihood of needing to deploy and sustain force elements at a
distance; and

  - the demands of close operational coordination with regional and international
security partners.

At the same time, the longer term development of the national support capacity and
the value of defence activities and investment in fostering national industry cannot be
ignored.

|---|---|---|---|---|


With respect to the most immediate need to deliver effective capability in the shorter
term, a number of initiatives will be undertaken. They are:

  - strengthening the current partnership with private sector companies, including
where appropriate formal agreements, to ensure that relevant stockholdings can

be supplemented within short timeframes;

  - develop within Support Services the capacity to deploy a logistic support unit. The
services available might vary from a single supply officer or Regimental Aid Post to


a more substantial and multi-skilled commitment including first line field

maintenance facilities for wheeled vehicles and/or helicopters; and

- more specifically, developing a more formal arrangement with Royal Brunei Airlines
as the national carrier to make aircraft available to support strategic deployments


of troops and specialist capabilities.

The option to offer field medical support would be a valuable contribution to any future
disaster relief operations. In the short term, the aim will be to have available two fully
equipped Regimental Aid Posts. Over time and depending on operational experience,
this might be expanded to a full field hospital capability.

A comprehensive defence industry policy is being introduced to support the longer
term development of a resource efficient, sustainable defence capability. The Defence
Industrial Development Plan has a three pronged strategy. It seeks to develop the
defence industrial sector through:

  - commercialisation/ corporatisation/ privatisation;

  - import substitution; and

  - the Economic Enhancement Program.


In doing so, the plan also has the potential to provide wider benefits. Defence expenditure,
in terms of scale and the expertise it fosters, can be an important driver of national
industrial development. The objectives of the program are to:

  - provide for an acceptable or meaningful level of equity participation in the project
by the Ministry of Defence based on sound business and fiscal considerations;

  - develop a meaningful and sustainable human resource strategy to promote and
maximise the employment and participation of the people of Brunei Darussalam in

the project;

  - assist in the development and expansion of and collaboration with local SMEs in
Brunei Darussalam by engaging such enterprises in the project on competitive

basis from inception and thereafter;

  - assist in the development and promotion of spin off industries or business which
supports, complements and/or is dependent on the business of the project, in

Brunei Darussalam;

  - promote and develop a programme for the transfer of technology in relation to
the production, manufacturing, business and other related activities of the project

to benefit the people, businesses and industries of Brunei Darussalam;

  - develop and practice environmentally high standards, policies and practices
in undertaking the project in Brunei Darussalam and which are compliant with


progressive industry standards and practices relative to those practiced in

developed countries and/ or the prevailing laws and/ or government or administrative


policies of Brunei Darussalam; and

  - develop a meaningful, beneficial and progressive community development and
outreach programmes for the public and private sectors and the local community.

Implementation of defence industry policy will be undertaken progressively, recognising
the currently limited capacity of the private industrial sector in some areas and the


-----

need to ensure that the necessary skills are fostered in the local community. Immediate
candidates for commercialisation and/or privatisation would be non-combat services
such as catering, administrative transport and the provision of private housing.

The emphasis in this Defence Update on:



  - utilising commercial specifications where these are not critical to desired operational
outcomes; and

  - factoring through life support considerations in new equipment purchases

will provide a further catalyst for industry development. Life-long maintenance and support
and the capacity of local industry to maintain, and if necessary upgrade, platforms and
systems, will in future be a factor in all procurement strategies.


Army’s fleet of wheeled vehicles is already supported commercially. Other potential areas
include deeper maintenance for the new naval vessels and for both rotary and fixed wing
air assets. Where commonality of platforms, sensors or communication systems (whether
within the defence force or across a range of government agencies) can be achieved, the
critical mass of work to make local support more viable will be enhanced. Maintenance
services at the naval dockyard, which has the capacity to support all maritime agency
vessels, could be commercialised and many defence facilities maintained by the private
sector.

###### Human Resource Development and Management


-----

The development and management of human resources is an essential element in
capability enhancement. The demands of future defence deployments in terms of rapid
deployment, complex operational environment, and sensitive policy choices will demand
expertise, professionalism and skills in personnel at all levels of the Ministry of Defence
and RBAF, including the Reserve Force. Both the introduction of new capabilities and the
added emphasis on specialisations will require comprehensive training in niche areas.
Specific programs for that will be included in new capability proposals. Advanced training
technologies including simulation and cooperation with external training provider will be
incorporated into this development.

Each of the Services Commanders, Commandant and Heads of Departments will be
tasked to undertake a comprehensive training needs analysis across their area of
responsibility to assess how well matched current programs are to the demands of the
new operational, command and management environments. They will also identify areas
where particular centres of excellence offer high quality training in areas of value to other
national agencies and to regional security partners. For the provision of technical skills,
the RBAF will rely on the national support base.


In developing the various elements within the centre of excellence, the RBAF should give
to areas where it can offer high quality training in areas for potential development. This


-----

would include Jungle Warfare Training and Search and Rescue. The introduction of the
new naval vessels, and development of the associated operational and support skills,
also provide the opportunity to establish a Maritime Training Institution with courses of
value to other government agencies and commercial operators.

More broadly, a Defence Academy is to be established to be the focus of continuous
professional development. This will build upon current initiatives to strengthen recruitment
standards and significantly increase the number of officers the RBAF is able to attract
and train. Initially, the existing Junior Staff Course and Executive Development Program

will be brought under the Academy together with a range of specific training courses.
The next step will be to establish an Officer Cadet School, followed by an Advanced
Command and Staff Course. The courses and programs will be accredited with leading
educational and training institutions.


To attract and retain high quality policy and managers, the Ministry of Defence will continue
its program of awarding both Supreme Commander of the Royal Brunei Armed Forces
and the Royal Brunei Armed Forces scholarships to outstanding Bruneian students. It
will also recognise outstanding performance among its officers by awarding in-service
training schemes for further studies as part of life long continuous learning process. At the
same time, improve and expand the military cadet scheme in educational institutions.

There will also be a strong emphasis on research and development in relation to
new concepts and doctrine and capability planning. The setting up of the Sultan Haji
Hassanal Bolkiah Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies which provide research,
fora and exchanges to stimulate intellectual discussions is a move in the right direction
to achieving these goals. A Directorate of Science and Technology will be established to
provide a focus for these activities.


In line with developing and enhancing RBAF capability in all areas, the performance
and well being of its soldier must be maintained at the maximum level. RBAF must look
towards the future and utilise the latest scientific knowledge and technology to optimise
the soldier’s performance from conducting research and the evaluation of personal
equipment and its impact on the individual, to the method of training them for combat
fitness. A performance optimisation centre therefore needs to be established to fulfill
these requirements.
