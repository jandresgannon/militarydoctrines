#### Norwegian
 security and defence
 policy

**The framework parameters against which Norway’s security**
**policy is formulated are changing. The decade that has**
**elapsed since the end of the Cold War can be regarded as a**
**transitional phase, which has now passed.**

**Security Policy Objectives**
A comprehensive and quantifiably
real threat has been replaced by
uncertainty and unpredictability. The same
applies to Norway’s neighbouring areas
where the inherent strategic importance of
the northern region, and the need to
administer and safeguard natural resources
extending over vast sea areas, are key factors
in our security and defence policy.



_• to uphold Norwegian sovereignty,_
_Norwegian rights and interests, and_
_protect Norwegian freedom of action in_
_the face of political, military and other_
_kinds of pressure;_

_• to defend together with our Allies Norway_
_and NATO against assault and attack;_

_• to protect society against assault and_
_attack, by state and non-state actors._

**Defence policy objectives**
The contribution made by Norway’s defence
organisation to the achievement of the national
security policy objectives set out above, will
depend on its ability to meet its more specific
defence policy objectives. The Armed Forces, as
an instrument of policy, must be able to:

_• alone and together with Allies secure Norwegian_
_sovereignty, safeguard Norwegian rights and_
_interests as well as ensuring Norwegian freedom of_
_action in the face of military or other pressure;_

_• together with Allies, through participation in_
_multinational peace operations and international_
_defence cooperation, contribute to peace, stability,_
_the enforcement of international law and respect_
_for human rights, and to prevent the use of force by_
_state and non-state actors against Norway and_
_NATO._


Norway has now, as have many other
nations worldwide, entered an epoch which
could be termed the global age.
Geographical borders no longer afford the
same degree of protection against a broad
spectrum of security threats and challenges.
We must therefore take steps to ensure our
security in this new instable and
unpredictable environment. Faced with
these challenges, it is important that Norway,
together with its allies and partners,
contributes to the prevention and limitation
of crises, armed conflicts and war. The
fundamental objectives of Norwegian

_• contribute to safeguarding the security of_
_Norwegian society, save lives, and limit the_
_consequences of accidents, disasters,_
_assaults and attacks by state and non-_
_state actors._

**Defence tasks**
By successfully handling their tasks the
Norwegian Armed Forces will fulfil the
defence policy objectives. The NAF´s tasks are
divided into a) national tasks, b) tasks that are
carried out in cooperation with Allies and
possibly others and c) other tasks.


**The Defence Concept**
The Defence Concept provides a concise but
comprehensive description of the most
central principles that form the basis for the
future development and activities of the NAF.

**_The Norwegian Armed Forces are to_**

**_be developed as a modern, flexible_**

**_and Alliance-adapted instrument of_**

**_security policy, with a balance being_**

**_sought between the NAF´s tasks,_**

**_organisational structure and funding._**

**_The NAF´s activities are to be based_**

**_on close cooperation with relevant_**

**_civil authorities and on military_**

**_conscription adapted to the needs of_**

**_the NAF. Focus will be on securing and_**

**_promoting Norwegian interests_**

**_through the ability to handle a broad_**

**_range of challenges, both nationally_**

**_and internationally._**


_National tasks_

-  to ensure a national basis for decision-
making through timely surveillance
and intelligence gathering;

-  to exercise Norwegian sovereignty;

-  to exercise Norwegian authority in
defined areas;

-  to prevent and manage security-related
incidents and crises in Norway and in
areas under Norwegian jurisdiction.

_Tasks to be carried out in cooperation with_
_Allies, and possibly others_

-  to contribute to the collective defence of
Norway and other parts of NATO against
threats, assault and attacks, including the
use of weapons of mass destruction;

-  to contribute to multinational crisis
management, including multilateral
peace operations.

_Other tasks_

-  to provide military support to diplomacy
and to prevent the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction;

-  to contribute towards safeguarding the
security of society and other vital tasks.

### The UN

**The United Nations plays a key**
**role in Norwegian security**
**policy.**

Our security is closely linked to the
existence of well-functioning arrangements
for security cooperation on a global level.
The altered picture of risks and threats, in
which geography plays a reduced role and
threats are global, reinforces this point. It is
in Norway´s interest that international
security challenges are resolved through
broad consensus, based on the principles of
the UN Charter and in line with international law.

The UN itself does not have the sufficient
resources to conduct all the peace support
operations required to safeguard international peace and security, and therefore
prefers that regional organisations assume
an active responsibility on its behalf.
Through such a division of labour, regional
organisations like NATO, the EU and the AU
may help the UN and thereby strengthen
the UN´s role and capacity. Operations led
by the UN and operations carried out with a
UN mandate, both support the UN´s work
for international peace and security.


### NATO

**The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) is an alliance**
**between 26 North American and European countries dedicated to**
**fulfil the aims of the North Atlantic Treaty, signed on 4 April 1949.**

The following countries are now
members of NATO: Belgium,
Bulgaria, Canada, the Czech
Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia,
Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia,
Slovenia, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom
and the United States of America.

Within the overall framework of the UN,
NATO remains the cornerstone of Norwegian security and defence policy.
NATO´s geographical focus is the EuroAtlantic area and the Alliance actively works
to promote security and stability
throughout this entire area. The main focus
is prevention, containment and resolution of
regional crises and conflicts that may
escalate and threaten the security of
member countries. However, the fact that
the new security challenges have a global
reach also affects NATO cooperation. NATO´s
collective security guarantee where an
attack against one is considered as an attack
against all is based on the ability to counter
threats and security challenges where they

The division of

**constitutional responsibility**

for the Norwegian Armed Forces

**According to the Norwegian Constitution, the King is the**
**Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. This authority**
**is exercised by the King in the Council of State, i.e. by**
**the government.**


top military adviser. The Chief of Defence’s
support staffs occupy posts both in the
Ministry of Defence and in the Defence Staff.
The Defence Staff has been established to
assist the Chief of Defence in the running of
the Armed Forces’ military organisation. The
military operational headquarters of the
Armed Forces, the National Joint
Headquarters, has been established as a
national headquarters in command of joint
operations and the coordination of territorial
forces kept under national command in the
event of crisis and war.

The Chief of Defence has full command of
Norwegian Defence in peacetime. In time of
war, the Chief of Defence continues to be the
government’s closest military adviser, while
the command authority is assumed to be
transferred to NATO’s Integrated Command
Structure.


Political control of the Armed
Forces is exercised through
cooperation and the division of
power between the Parliament and the
Government. It is the Government which
has the highest executive authority
responsible for military and civil
preparedness in peacetime, and for the
command of all aspects of national defence
in time of crisis and war. In important cases
involving foreign- and security policy, the
Parliament’s agencies are consulted prior to
decisions being taken. Clause 25 in the
Norwegian Constitution moreover states
that the armed forces «must not increase or
decrease in strength without the
Parliament’s consent.» The Parliamentary
Defence Committee deals with matters
concerning military defence and civil
emergency.

The Minister of Defence heads the Royal
Norwegian Ministry of Defence and carries
the constitutional and political
responsibility for the activities of the Armed
Forces All matters not decided in Council


are decided by the Minister, or by
departmental officials on the Minister’s
behalf. So-called «military command
matters», i.e. matters concerning
mobilisation and defence plans, are dealt
with outside the Council. The Minister of
Defence presents such matters to the King
in the presence of the Prime Minister and
the Minister of Foreign Affairs alone. This
procedure is adopted only very occasionally.

Responsibility for the coordination of civil
emergency planning lies with the Ministry
of Justice. All other ministries are
responsible for emergency planning in their
own sectors.

The military command authority is
delegated to military commanders.

The Chief of Defence is the country’s
highest-ranking military official, and is
principal military adviser to the government
on military matters. The Chief of Defence is
head of the Armed Forces military
organisation and is the Ministry of Defence’s

#### The Ministry
 of Defence

**The Ministry of Defence is a political and administrative**
**institution. It is thus both a part of the apparatus of political**
**government and a part of the administrative system.**


The Defence Minister is a member
of the Government and the
overall head of the Ministry.
Directly subordinate to the Minister is the
State Secretary. The Ministry’s most senior
permanent civil servant is the Secretary
General. The Chief of Defence exercises his
role as the Defence Minister’s top military
adviser and his strategic functions are now
integrated within the Ministry. The
Ministry of Defence is organised in five
departments with a total staff of
approximately 300. There are both civil
and military posts at all levels within the
Ministry.

concerned with preventive security across
both military and civil sectors. The mission
of the NoNSA is to protect vital assets and
information against such security threats as
espionage, sabotage or terrorism.

**The Norwegian Defence Research**
**Establishment**
is a civilian research establishment
organised as an administrative agency with
special responsibilities, answerable directly
to the Ministry of Defence. FFI is the prime
research and development agency where
matters of defence and security are
concerned. The Establishment also advises
the strategic leadership of the Norwegian
Armed Forces’ military organisation. In
particular the Establishment studies
developing trends in science and military
technology, focusing on aspects that may
have a bearing on security policy or
defence planning.

**Norwegian Defence Estates**
**Agency**
The Defence Estates Agency is an administrative agency subordinate to the Ministry
of Defence. The agency’s primary tasks
relate to the planning, construction,
administration, leasing and disposal by sale
of defence estates and properties. The
buildings administered by the agency cover
several million square metres. Other
property includes a land area of
approximately 1,3 billion square meters.
The Armed Forces represents the agency’s
largest and most important customer but
the agency is not part of the Armed Forces’
military organisation


#### Personnel
 and education

One of the principal objectives of the personnel policy is to enable the armed
services to recruit and retain able and highly motivated personnel with the
competence required to undertake military missions. The Armed Forces should
appear as attractive employers, continuously developing the skills of their
employees. Priority is put on recruiting, competence building, career and
leadership development, health and safety, payment policy and family aspects. A
core aspect of personnel policy is to include the need for the right competence
at the right time and in the
right place, and to espouse a
culture that is both inclusive
and open to diversity.The
personnel structure of the
armed Forces is changing to
include more service
personnel on regular
engagements, a new
category of junior officers,
and making it mandatory to
accept assignments to
international operations. The
whole educational system is
being modernised with
improved training in Officer
Candidate Schools, Military
Academies offering
opportunities to gain
recognised qualifications at
Bachelor level, and a Staff
College offering a Master´s
degree.

#### The Armed Forces
 military organisation

**• The Defence Staff**

**• National Joint Headquarters**

**• Norwegian Defence Logistics Organisation**


**The Defence Staff**
The Defence Staff is responsible,
on behalf of the Chief of Defence,
for ensuring that decisions are followed up
and for exercising day-to-day employer
responsibility for personnel employed in


the Armed Forces’ military organisation.
This entails ensuring that the plans and
budgets adopted and communicated by
the Ministry of Defence are implemented.
The individual Service Chiefs of Staff, as
part of the Defence Staff, are responsible


for force production in their respective
Service branches.

**National Joint Headquarters**
The National Joint Headquarters (FOHK),
together with the Regional Headquarters,
constitute the operational leadership of the
Armed Forces. The National Joint
Headquarters plans and leads most of the
exercises and operations involving the
Norwegian armed services. Regional
Headquarters South was closed in 2005 and
Regional Headquarters North (LDKN) is now
operating as a national crisis management
centre for the Northern areas. The National
Joint Headquarters takes over a number of
tasks hitherto carried out by the Regional
Headquarters including those connected
with the allied stockpiles in Trøndelag.
Regional Headquarters North (LDKN)
functions as a forward command element,
subordinate to the National Joint
Headquarters (FOHK), responsible for the
continuous monitoring of the situation
picture in Norwegian sea areas and other
sea areas under Norwegian jurisdiction.

**Norwegian Defence Logistics**
**Organisation**
NDLO’s areas of responsibility include acting
as a centre of professional expertise and the
provision of engineering, procurement,
investment, supply, information and
communications technology (ICT) services,
as well as the maintenance, repair and
storage of materiel. NDLO is also responsible
for the operation of communications- and

computer systems within the Defence
Establishment. The organisation moreover
supports the Army, Navy, Air Force and Home
Guard force production functions as well as
the operational units of the Armed Forces.

**The Intelligence Service**
The Intelligence service acquires information
concerning matters outside Norway’s
borders. It also gathers, processes and
analyses that information which relates to
Norway’s interests seen in relation to foreign
states, organisations and individuals. The
purpose of intelligence activity is to
contribute towards providing the Norwegian
authorities with a solid basis for decision
making where security, defence and foreign
policy matters are concerned.


#### National service

According to the Norwegian Constitution, all fit male citizens are obligated
to serve in the defence of their country. Liability to military service starts at
the age of 19, and continues until the age of 44.
It is the Armed Forces´operational requirements that determine the number
of conscripts needed. The Conscription will be oriented towards the best
qualified and most highly motivated young people. To make sure the same
information about military service is given to all regardless of gender, young
woman are being invited to attend a voluntary initial interview as from 2006.
Conscientious objectors may seek to be exempted from military service and
to undertake service in the community in lieu.

The highest priority will be given to the recruiting of the most suitable young
people either for regular service on contract or as junior or full career officers.

The National Service Administration on behalf of the Chief of Defence, has
responsibility for conscript administration covering all service branches. Its
tasks include initial testing, appointments and call-up for initial service. The
National Service Administration is also responsible for the administration of
conscripts while they are not actually serving.

#### The concept of
 Total Defence

**Throughout the post-war period, Norway’s defence was based**


cooperation between the defence
organisation, with its military arm, and civil
society. This applies across the whole
spectrum of crisis, from peacetime incidents,
through security crises of whatever
magnitude, to a war situation. It is no longer
necessary for the emergency powers


**on the concept of «Total Defence». Fundamentally, this means**
**being able, if necessary, to mobilise the full range of resources**
**available to Norwegian society in order to defend the home-**
**land and for the management of acute security situations that**
**might arise in war or under the threat of war.**

Judged on these criteria the Total Defence concept has had to be

prominent consideration, and the traditional essentially based on mutual support and communities in relation to preventive

measures, emergency planning and
operational matters. The principle of civil
assistance for the Armed Forces in situations
of crisis or war remains unchanged. The new
Total Defence concept increases the
emphasis on
military aid to the civil authorities. Service
units can provide support for the civil
community in the context of serious
incidents. A guiding principle is that the
armed services will contribute all available
capabilities, skills and resources with which
they have been provided for the
performance of their primary tasks.


-----

#### Civil
 protection


The Ministry of Justice and the Police has
the overall responsibility for the
coordination and oversight of civil
protection and civil emergency planning.
The Directorate for Civil Protection and
Emergency Planning (DSB) and the Norwegian National Security Agency (NoNSA)


**Today, at a time when there is no evident military threat, work being**
**done in the area of civil protection is focused on the protection of**
**the civil community, including vital public functions and material**
**assets. The aim is to make Norway a safe and secure country to live**
**in. Current civil protection work is therefore based on coordinated**
**and prioritised use of the full range of resources available.**

This work on civil protection affects situation. The principle of locality means that

The defence authorities, including the
armed services, contributes to the work of
civil protection within the constraints of
their available resources. The Armed Forces
will contribute to civil emergency in the
case of accidents, rescue operations,
disasters and other situations where
peoples lives and health or property is at
risk. The Armed Forces have a duty to act
against, and help prevent, any assault and
attack on the country´s inhabitants,
infrastructure or administrative leadership.
The combating and prevention of terrorism
is primarily a task for the police. However,
the Armed Forces will, when requested,
assist the police in such situations.


-----

#### Operations abroad


Within the framework of international law, the
Armed Forces must be able to contribute
appropriate military capabilities in support of peace,
stability and the international rule of law in the wider
world. Crisis management in this context could
involve all kinds of security challenges and might, in
principle, need to be exercised anywhere in the
world in the form of operations lead either by


established organisations such as the UN, NATO or
the EU, or by a suitably mandated coalition. To make
this possible, personnel in all branches of the Services
must be available for both national and international missions. The tasks involved include participation,
together with our allies, in multinational operations
and international defence collaboration designed to
prevent the onset of an acute crisis through the
appropriate deployment of forces, for example to
prevent the unauthorised use of force, either by sta

of human rights. Since 1947 Norway has contributed
military personnel to over 40 international
operations abroad and some 120,000 Norwegians
have served in these operations. At the beginning
of 2006, some 550 Norwegian men and women are
taking part in operations in countries overseas
including Afghanistan, the Middle East, Ethiopia/Eritrea, Sudan and the Balkans. All three Armed Services
include rapid response forces of the highest quality
which are fully trained to provide specific military

operations - rank and file as well as officers and NCOs. Local branches of the Association have been established
and cover the whole country. The Association publishes the magazine, «Den Blå Beret, Sjekkposten» (The Blue

was founded in 1951 and its membership consists of 75 large nation-wide professional, cultural, humanitarian,
and youth organisations. Through conferences, courses, seminars, visits to schools, lectures, study tours, etc. the

organisation spreads information about Norway’s Total Defence concept and about our foreign and security policy as established by the Storting. The organisation publishes the magazine «Folk og Forsvar» and, at intervals,
produces pamphlets/books on relevant topics/issues.

**The Norwegian Women’s Voluntary Defence Association**
was founded in 1951 and is an organisation for nation-wide co-operation between professional, cultural and
humanitarian organisations with a large number of women members. The Association’s objectives are to
disseminate information about the country’s Total Defence, to work to strengthen the potential of the civil community to meet crisis situations in peace and war, to seek to enhance and coordinate the preparedness of member
organisations, and to promote co-operation between the voluntary organisations and the emergency planning
authorities.

**The Norwegian Defence Association**
was founded in 1886, adopting as its motto «The question of defence is a question of peace». Through its
provision of information, the NDA seeks to increase awareness of defence and security policy and to foster a
better understanding and appreciation of Norway’s overall defence concept. This is achieved through contact
with political authorities, information in the media, meetings, lectures, seminars etc. The association publishes
the magazine «Norges Forsvar» 10 times a year, with an annual issue in English, together with a quarterly newsletter for members. The NDA also issues a variety of brochures and other publications.

**The Norwegian Women’s Defence League**
was founded in 1928 and is a politically neutral organisation based on voluntary efforts. Under the motto «For
home and country», NLF works to strengthen the nation’s will to defend itself and to train women for participation
in defence-related activities in peacetime as well as in time of war. Any Norwegian woman over 16 years of age
who is in sympathy with these aims may become a member («lotte») after completing basic training. NLF
publishes a membership magazine «Lottebladet» with six issues a year.

**The Norwegian Reserve Officers’ Federation**
was founded in 1896 and is a freestanding organisation for officers of all three services and the Home Guard
but is now oriented particularly towards reserve officers. The NROF’s objective is to strengthen Norway’s Total
Defence, and to promote public awareness of the importance of a defence, by strengthening the position of
reserve officers in the community, improving reserve officers’ military qualifications, protecting their interests
during service, and promoting international co-operation between reserve officers. The Association publishes
the magazine «Pro Patria / Vårt Vern» in association with the Union of Academy Trained Officers.

**The National Rifle Association of Norway**
was established in 1893 with the objective of fostering practical shooting skills among the Norwegian people
in case such skills should be needed in the cause of national defence. The shooting clubs maintain close relations with the military, especially the Home Guard. The shooting clubs make their ranges available to Armed
Forces personnel for instruction and practice and the Armed Forces in turn provide support for club events.

**Oslo Military Society**
was founded under the name Christiania Military Society in 1825. The aims of the Society were to promote a
deeper interest in all aspects of defence and the military sciences through lectures, discussions and the
publication of the Norwegian Military Journal, and to foster comradeship between officers of all service branches
though congenial social gatherings.

**The Retirement Association of the Norwegian Defence**
The Association was founded in 1983 and is a countrywide confederation of retired servicemen’s associations.
The aims of the Association are to safeguard and promote the financial, social and welfare interests of its members
and to foster the spirit of national defence, thus strengthening the standing of the armed forces, with their
members past and present, in the community, and to work with the central military and civil authorities, officers’
associations and other ex-servicemen’s associations, as well as other pensioners’ associations country wide, for
the common good of the members.
