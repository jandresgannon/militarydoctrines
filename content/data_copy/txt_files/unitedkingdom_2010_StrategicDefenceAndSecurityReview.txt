### Foreword

Our country has always had global responsibilities and global ambitions. We have a proud history of
standing up for the values we believe in and we should have no less ambition for our country in the
decades to come. But we need to be more thoughtful, more strategic and more coordinated in the way
we advance our interests and protect our national security.

The difficult legacy we have inherited has necessitated tough decisions to get our economy back on track.
Our national security depends on our economic security and vice versa. So bringing the defence budget
back to balance is a vital part of how we tackle the deficit and protect this country’s national security.

Nevertheless, because of the priority we are placing on our national security, defence and security
budgets will contribute to deficit reduction on a lower scale than some other departments. The defence
budget will rise in cash terms. It will meet the NATO 2% target throughout the next four years. We
expect to continue with the fourth largest military budget in the world.

We are extraordinarily proud of everyone who works tirelessly on our behalf to keep us safe at home
and to protect our interests overseas – our Armed Forces, police, intelligence officers, diplomats and
many others. As a nation we owe them an immense debt of gratitude. They are a fundamental part of
our sense of national identity. And it is vital for the security of future generations that these capabilities
are retained. But to retain their effectiveness, they must adapt to face the realities and uncertainties of the
21st Century.

We remain fully committed to succeeding in the difficult mission in Afghanistan, and there will as now be
extra resources to meet the full costs of that campaign. We face a severe terrorist threat that has origins
at home and overseas. Crucially, as the National Security Strategy sets out, we face an ever more diverse
range of security risks.

We must find more effective ways to tackle risks to our national security – taking an integrated approach,
both across government and internationally, to identify risks early and treat the causes, rather than having
to deal with the consequences. That is why we have established a National Security Council to draw this
entire effort together. It is why, given the direct linkages between instability and conflict, our Department
for International Development will double its investment in tackling and preventing conflict around
the globe, consistent with the international rules for Official Development Assistance. Our approach
recognises that when we fail to prevent conflict and are obliged to intervene militarily, it costs far more.
And that is why we will expand our ability to deploy military and civilian experts together to support
stabilisation efforts and build capacity in other states, as a long-term investment in a more stable world.


-----

We will continue to give the highest priority to tackling the terrorist threat, protecting our operational
capabilities, and reforming how we tackle radicalisation, while also reviewing all our counter-terrorism
powers to ensure we retain only those that are necessary to protect the public, thereby safeguarding
British civil liberties. We will act resolutely against both the threat from Al Qaeda and its affiliates and
followers, and against the threat from residual terrorism linked to Northern Ireland.

At home, we must become more resilient both to external threats and to natural disasters, like major
flooding and pandemics. We will establish a transformative national programme to protect ourselves in
cyber space. Over the last decade the threat to national security and prosperity from cyber attacks has
increased exponentially. Over the decades ahead this trend is likely to continue to increase in scale and
sophistication, with enormous implications for the nature of modern conflict. We need to be prepared as
a country to meet this growing challenge, building on the advanced capabilities we already have.

We have also re-assessed and reformed our approach in a wide range of other areas crucial to UK
national security – including civil emergencies, energy security, organised crime, counter proliferation and
border security. We will maintain robust intelligence capabilities to contribute across the spectrum of
national security activity.

And we will reconfigure our Armed Forces to make them better able to meet the threats of the future.

Our Armed Forces – admired across the world – have been overstretched, deployed too often without
appropriate planning, with the wrong equipment, in the wrong numbers and without a clear strategy. In
the past, unfunded spending pledges created a fundamental mismatch between aspiration and resources.
And there was a failure to face up to the new security realities of the post Cold War world. The Royal
Navy was locked into a cycle of ever smaller numbers of ever more expensive ships. We have an Army
with scores of tanks in Germany but forced to face the deadly threat of improvised explosive devices in
Iraq and Afghanistan in Land Rovers designed for Northern Ireland. And the Royal Air Force has been
hampered in its efforts to support our forces overseas because of an ageing and unreliable strategic airlift
fleet. This is the result of the failure to take the bold decisions needed to adjust our defence plans to face
the realities of our ever-changing world.

This Review has started the process of bringing programmes and resources back into balance, making our
Armed Forces among the most versatile in the world.

In terms of the Army, in this age of uncertainty our ground forces will continue to have a vital operational
role. That is why we are determined to retain a significant, well-equipped Army. We will continue to
be one of very few countries able to deploy a self-sustaining, properly equipped brigade-sized force
anywhere around the world and sustain it indefinitely. As the Army is withdrawn from Germany, we will
reduce its heavy armour and artillery, although we will retain the ability to regenerate those capabilities
if need be. The introduction of new armoured vehicles, enhanced communications equipment and new
strategic lift aircraft, will make the Army more mobile and more flexible. It will be better adapted to face
current and future threats, with the type of equipment it needs to prevail in today’s conflicts.

Battlefield helicopters will be vital for the range of missions set out in the National Security Strategy.
We will buy 12 additional heavy lift Chinook helicopters. We will extend the life of the Puma helicopter
to ensure that sufficient helicopters are available for our forces in Afghanistan. The Merlin force will be
upgraded to enhance its ability to support amphibious operations. Taken together with the continued
introduction of the Wildcat helicopters for reconnaissance and command and control purposes, this
programme will deliver a properly scaled and balanced helicopter force to support our troops into the
future.


-----

Members of the Territorial Army and the other Reserve Forces have performed outstandingly well in
Afghanistan, yet again demonstrating their great value. We need to make sure that they are organised to
deal with the threats of today, recognising that they were originally geared for a Cold War role. We will
want to look carefully at the ways in which some other countries use and structure their reserve forces,
and see what lessons we might usefully apply here. So we will conduct a review of our Reserve Forces. It
will examine whether they are properly structured to enable us to make the most efficient use of their
skills, experience and capabilities in the modern era.

The immense contribution of our highly professional Special Forces is necessarily largely unreported. We
are investing more in them to increase their effectiveness even further.

In terms of the Royal Navy, we will complete the construction of two large aircraft carriers. The
Government believes it is right for the United Kingdom to retain, in the long term, the capability that only
aircraft carriers can provide – the ability to deploy air power from anywhere in the world, without the
need for friendly air bases on land. In the short term, there are few circumstances we can envisage where
the ability to deploy airpower from the sea will be essential. That is why we have, reluctantly, taken the
decision to retire the Harrier aircraft, which has served our country so well. But over the longer term, we
cannot assume that bases for land-based aircraft will always be available when and where we need them.
That is why we need an operational carrier. But the last Government committed to carriers that would
have been unable to work properly with our closest military allies. It will take time to rectify this error, but
we are determined to do so. We will fit a catapult to the operational carrier to enable it to fly a version
of the Joint Strike Fighter with a longer range and able to carry more weapons. Crucially, that will allow
our carrier to operate in tandem with the US and French navies, and for American and French aircraft
to operate from our carrier and vice versa. And we will retain the Royal Marine brigade, and an effective
amphibious capability.

We are procuring a fleet of the most capable, nuclear powered hunter-killer submarines anywhere in
the world. They are able to operate in secret across the world’s oceans, fire Tomahawk cruise missiles
at targets on land, detect and attack other submarines and ships to keep the sea lanes open, protect the
nuclear deterrent and feed strategic intelligence back to the UK and our military forces across the world.
We will complete the production of the six Type 45 destroyers at £1 billion a ship, one of the most
effective multi-role destroyers in the world. We will embark on a new programme of less expensive,
modern frigates, more flexible and better able to take on today’s naval tasks of tackling drug trafficking,
piracy and counter-terrorism.

We will retain and renew our independent nuclear deterrent – the United Kingdom’s ultimate insurance
policy in this age of uncertainty. As a result of our value for money review, we will reduce the number
of operational launch tubes on the submarines from 12 to eight, and the number of warheads from
48 to 40, in line with our commitment vigorously to pursue multilateral global disarmament. This will
help reduce costs by £750 million over the period of the spending review, and by £3.2 billion over the
next ten years. ‘Initial Gate’ – a decision to move ahead with early stages of the work involved – will be
approved and the next phase of the project will start by the end of this year. ‘Main Gate’ – the decision to
start building the submarines – is required around 2016. It is right that the United Kingdom should retain
a credible, continuous and effective minimum nuclear deterrent for as long as the global security situation
makes that necessary.

In terms of the Royal Air Force, by the 2020s it will be based around a fleet of two of the most
capable fighter jets anywhere in the world: a modernised Typhoon fleet fully capable of air-to-air and
air-to-ground missions; and the Joint Strike Fighter, the world’s most advanced multi-role combat jet.
The fast jet fleet will be complemented by a growing fleet of Unmanned Air Vehicles in both combat
and reconnaissance roles. Our fast jets will be backed up the most modern air-to-air refuelling aircraft,
extending their reach and endurance. The strategic air transport fleet will be enhanced with the


-----

introduction of the highly capable A400M transport aircraft. Together with the existing fleet of C17
aircraft, they will allow us to fly our forces wherever they are needed in the world. Our new Rivet Joint
aircraft will gather vital intelligence. In this year in which we remember the 70th Anniversary of the Battle
of Britain, the RAF has a vital continuing role.

All too often, we focus on military hardware. But we know from our many visits to Afghanistan and to
military units around our country, that ultimately it is our people that really make the difference. As a
country, we have failed to give them the support they deserve. We are putting that right, even in the
very difficult economic circumstances we face. We will renew the military covenant, that vital contract
between the Armed Forces, their families, our veterans and the country they sacrifice so much to
keep safe. Each and every one of us has a responsibility to do more to support the men and women of
our Armed Forces. We must never send our soldiers, sailors and airmen into battle without the right
equipment, the right training or the right support. That objective has been a fundamental guiding principle
of this Review, and it is one to which this Government will remain absolutely committed.

### National Security Tasks and Planning Guidelines


##### Introduction

1.1 This Strategic Defence and Security Review
is long overdue. It is the first time that a UK
government has taken decisions on its defence,
security, intelligence, resilience, development and
foreign affairs capabilities in the round. It sets out
the ways and means to deliver the ends set out in
the National Security Strategy. It links judgements
on where to direct effort and focus the available
resources, to choices on which risks and policies
to prioritise. It sets a clear target for the national
security capabilities the UK will need by 2020, and
charts a course for getting there.

1.2 The challenge is to deliver this while heavily
engaged in Afghanistan; with inherited national
security budgets in overdraft; and in the midst of
the biggest financial crisis in a generation. Restoring
a strong economy is critical to sustaining the
effectiveness of our national security institutions. It
is therefore right that those institutions contribute
to tackling the deficit. However, we have been
clear that savings will not be made at the expense
of our core security: national security budgets have
been given relative protection in the Spending
Review. Operations in Afghanistan will be
protected and given priority. A cross-government
approach has ensured intelligent pruning of older
capabilities less well adapted to high priority
current and future risks; and encouraged the
design of more integrated, efficient and effective
plans in key areas like counter-terrorism, conflict
prevention and cyber security. However, the
unanticipated scale of the budgetary over­
extension has also made painful, short-term
measures unavoidable.


1.3 We are committed to undertaking further
strategic defence and security reviews every five
years. One clear lesson since the last Strategic
Defence Review in 1998 is the need more
frequently to reassess capabilities against a
changing strategic environment. We must avoid
the twin mistakes of retaining too much legacy
equipment for which there is no requirement,
or tying ourselves into unnecessarily ambitious
future capabilities. We have therefore identified
the forces and capabilities we may need in 2020,
but deliberately focussed in this Review on the
decisions that need to be taken in the next four
years, and left to 2015 those decisions which can
better be taken in the light of further experience
in Afghanistan and developments in the wider
economic situation.

##### The adaptable posture

1.4 The National Security Strategy sets out
two clear objectives: (i) to ensure a secure and
resilient UK by protecting our people, economy,
infrastructure, territory and ways of life from
all major risks that can affect us directly; and (ii)
to shape a stable world, by acting to reduce the
likelihood of risks affecting the UK or our interests
overseas, and applying our instruments of power
and influence to shape the global environment
and tackle potential risks at source. It also sets out
in its National Security Risk Assessment a clear
prioritisation of those potential threats we face.

1.5 This provided the basis for the National
Security Council to take decisions about the
relative importance of different national security
capabilities, and choose where to focus new
investment and savings First it decided an overall


-----

strategic policy framework – the adaptable
posture. The principal elements are:

i. to respond to the highest priority risks over the
next five years, we will:

#### • [ensure that our key ][counter-terrorist ]
capabilities are maintained and in some areas
enhanced, while still delivering efficiency gains

#### • [develop a transformative programme for ]
cyber security, which addresses threats from
states, criminals and terrorists, and seizes the
opportunities which cyber space provides for
our future prosperity and for advancing our
security interests

#### • [focus cross-government effort on ][natural ]
hazards, including major flooding and
pandemics, and on building corporate and
community resilience

#### • [focus and integrate diplomatic, intelligence, ]
defence and other capabilities on preventing
international military crises, while retaining
the ability to respond should they nevertheless
materialise.

ii. to respond to the low probability but very
high impact risk of a large-scale military attack by
another state, we will maintain our capacity to
deter, including through the nuclear deterrent and
by ensuring, in partnership with allies, the ability
to regenerate capabilities given sufficient strategic
notice. Lower probability does not automatically
mean less resource, because some capabilities are
inherently more costly than others.

iii. to respond to growing uncertainty about
longer-term risks and threats, we will pursue an
over-arching approach which:

#### • [identifies and manages risks before they ]
materialise in the UK, with a focus on preventing
conflicts and building local capacity to deal
with problems



#### • [maintains a broad spectrum of defence and ]
other capabilities, able to deter and contain, as
well as engage on the ground, developing threats

#### • [ensures those capabilities have in-built flexibility ]
to adjust to changing future requirements

#### • [strengthens mutual dependence with key allies ]
and partners who are willing and able to act,
not least to make our collective resources go
further and allow nations to focus on their
comparative advantages

#### • [coordinates and integrates the approach ]
across government, achieving greater effect by
combining defence, development, diplomatic,
intelligence and other capabilities.

##### National Security Tasks and Planning Guidelines

1.6 Based on the adaptable posture, the National
Security Council took a second set of decisions
on a comprehensive and cross-cutting set of
eight National Security Tasks, with more detailed
Planning Guidelines on how they are to be
achieved. These will drive detailed decisions by
departments over the next five years on how
to prioritise resource allocation and capability
development. For example, the requirement for
the military to undertake both stabilisation and
intervention missions drives the Defence Planning
Assumptions on type, scale and concurrency of
operations for which to configure the Armed
Forces, set out in Part Two.

1.7 The next three chapters on defence, the
deterrent and wider security explain how
all government departments will implement
these new National Security Tasks and Planning
Guidelines. They are followed by chapters on
what the implications will be for our alliances
and partnerships; and for the structural reforms
required to implement these changes.


-----

National security tasks and planning guidelines
We will:

1. Identify and monitor national security risks and opportunities. To deliver this we require:

#### • [a coordinated approach to early warning and horizon scanning ]
 • [strategic intelligence on potential threats to national security and opportunities for the UK to act ]
 • [coordinated analysis and assessment of the highest priorities ]
 • [investment in technologies to support the gathering of communications data vital for national ]
security and law enforcement

#### • [intelligence assets to support the core military, diplomatic and domestic security and resilience ]
requirements set out below, and our economic prosperity.

2. Tackle at root the causes of instability. To deliver this we require:

#### • [an effective international development programme making the optimal contribution to national ]
security within its overall objective of poverty reduction, with the Department for International
Development focussing significantly more effort on priority national security and fragile states

#### • [civilian and military stabilisation capabilities that can be deployed early together to help countries ]
avoid crisis or deal with conflict

#### • [targeted programmes in the UK, and in countries posing the greatest threat to the UK, to stop ]
people becoming terrorists.

3. Exert influence to exploit opportunities and manage risks. To deliver this we require:

#### • [a Diplomatic Service that supports our key multilateral and bilateral relationships and the ]
obligations that come from our status as a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a
leading member of NATO, the EU and other international organisations

#### • [a Foreign and Commonwealth Office-led global overseas network that focuses on safeguarding ]
the UK’s national security, building its prosperity, and supporting UK nationals around the world

#### • [coordinated cross-government effort overseas to build the capacity of priority national security ]
and fragile states to take increasing responsibility for their own stability

#### • [strategic military power projection to enhance security, deter or contain potential threats, and ]
support diplomacy.

4. Enforce domestic law and strengthen international norms to help tackle those who threaten
the UK and our interests, including maintenance of underpinning technical expertise in key
areas. To deliver this we require:

#### • [law enforcement capability to investigate and where possible bring to justice terrorists and the ]
most seriously harmful organised criminal groups impacting on the UK

#### • [continuous development of the rules-based international system ]
 • [stronger multilateral approaches for countering proliferation and securing fissile material and ]
expertise from malicious use

#### • [retention of our chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear science and technology capabilities ]
that contribute to counter-proliferation and our response to the potential use of such materials
by terrorist or state actors.


-----

5. Protect the UK and our interests at home, at our border and internationally, to address
physical and electronic threats from state and non-state sources. To deliver this we require:

#### • [a minimum effective nuclear deterrent ]
 • [secure borders ]
 • [security and intelligence services and police counter-terrorism capability to disrupt life-threatening ]
terrorist threats to the UK

#### • [military capabilities to help protect the UK from major terrorist attack ]
 • [an independent ability to defend the Overseas Territories militarily ]
 • [investment in new and flexible capabilities such as cyber to meet emerging risks and threats. ]

6. Help resolve conflicts and contribute to stability. Where necessary, intervene overseas, including
the legal use of coercive force in support of the UK’s vital interests, and to protect our overseas
territories and people. To deliver this we require:

#### • [an integrated approach to building stability overseas, bringing together better diplomatic, ]
development, military and other national security tools

#### • [Armed Forces capable of both stabilisation and intervention operations ]
 • [a civilian response scaled to support concurrency and scale of military operations ]
 • [the military ability to help evacuate UK citizens from crises overseas. ]

7. Provide resilience for the UK by being prepared for all kinds of emergencies, able to recover
from shocks and to maintain essential services. To deliver this we require:

#### • [security and resilience of the infrastructure most critical to keeping the country running ]
(including nuclear facilities) against attack, damage or destruction

#### • [crisis management capabilities able to anticipate and respond to a variety of major domestic ]
emergencies and maintain the business of government

#### • [resilient supply and distribution systems for essential services ]
 • [effective, well organised local response to emergencies in the UK, building on the capabilities of ]
local responders, businesses and communities

#### • [enhanced central government and Armed Forces planning, coordination and capabilities to help ]
deal with the most serious emergencies.

8. Work in alliances and partnerships wherever possible to generate stronger responses.
To deliver this we require:

#### • [collective security through NATO as the basis for territorial defence of the UK, and stability of our ]
European neighbourhood, as well as an outward-facing EU that promotes security and prosperity

#### • [our contribution to international military coalitions to focus on areas of comparative national ]
advantage valued by key allies, especially the United States, such as our intelligence capabilities and
highly capable elite forces

#### • [greater sharing of military capabilities, technologies and programmes, and potentially more ]
specialisation, working with key allies, including France, and based on appropriate formal
guarantees where necessary

#### • [a Defence Industrial and Technology policy that seeks to secure the independence of action we ]
need for our Armed Forces, while allowing for increased numbers of off-the-shelf purchases and
greater promotion of defence exports.

### Defence

2.1 The Armed Forces are at the core of our
nation’s security. They make a vital and unique
contribution. Above all, they give us the means to
threaten or use force when other levers of power
are unable to protect our vital national interests.

##### Context

2.2 Afghanistan remains the main effort of Defence.
We have in the region of 9,500 members of the
Armed Forces operating in Afghanistan as part of
a UN-mandated, NATO-led mission of 47 nations.
They are helping to deliver a stable Afghanistan able
to maintain its own security and to prevent Afghan
territory from again being used by Al Qaeda or
other terrorists as a base from which to plot and
launch attacks on the UK and our allies. President
Karzai’s stated objective is that the Afghan National
Security Forces will lead and conduct military
operations across Afghanistan by the end of 2014.
The international community has the right strategy
in place to support that aim. In 2015, the UK will
have reduced force levels significantly and our
troops will no longer be in a combat role, as we
move to a long-term defence relationship focussed
on training and capacity-building.

2.3 In the meantime, the Government is fully
committed to ensuring that the campaign is
properly resourced, funded and equipped. The
nature of the campaign will continue to evolve,
and we will regularly review the requirement for
troops and capabilities. We will ensure that we
provide our Armed Forces in Afghanistan with
the full range of training and equipment they need
and we will not take steps that could affect the
confidence and commitment of our people serving
there or their families supporting them at home


2.4 But we are delivering this commitment in
the context of inherited defence spending plans
that are completely unaffordable. There was
an unfunded liability of around £38 billion over
the next 10 years. That is more than the entire
Defence budget for one year. We must start
to tackle this legacy before we can begin to put
Defence on a sound and sustainable footing for
the future. And Defence must, like other parts of
government, contribute to reducing the deficit in
order to restore the economy. Section 2.D sets
out the major non-front line savings we will make,
and contracts we will cancel, in order to protect
the front line force structure as far as possible. But
unavoidable transition costs mean that the scale of
savings to pay off the Ministry of Defence (MOD)
overdraft cannot be achieved without some painful
measures in the short term.

2.5 We must also confront the legacy of
overstretch. Between 2006 and 2009 UK forces
were deployed at medium scale in both Iraq
and Afghanistan. This exceeded the planning
assumptions that had set the size of our forces and
placed greater demands both on our people and
on their equipment than had been planned for.

2.6 We must therefore give priority over the next
decade to recovering capabilities damaged or
reduced as a result of this overstretch. This takes
time and investment, but is needed to rebuild the
strength and restore the capability of our Armed
Forces to react effectively to new demands,
either while we are in Afghanistan or after our
commitment there has ended.

2.7 Not only will we be transforming our military
capability while fighting in Afghanistan, we will be


-----

doing so while the strategic context is uncertain.
The National Security Strategy sets out our
analysis of the current priority risks to our national
security, the major changes that might affect the
opportunities for and threats to the UK in the
future, and how we should respond. The future
character of conflict is also changing (see box).

##### Our approach

2.8 Given the scale of the challenges we face and
the importance we attach to national security, we
will not reduce defence expenditure as much as
we are obliged to in other areas of government
in order to bring the deficit we inherited under
control. Overall, the resources allocated for the
next four years will enable us to pursue today’s
operations and prepare for those of tomorrow.
However, they will also require tough decisions


which will result in some scaling back in the overall
size of the Armed Forces and the reduction of
some capabilities that are less critical to today’s
requirements.

2.9 Strengthening our key defence partnerships
is critical to managing those reductions. A
partnership approach requires us in turn to:

#### • [focus our planned forces on what we judge ]
will be of greatest utility to our allies as well as
the UK

#### • [broadly retain a full spectrum of capabilities, ]
even where we will be reducing their scale or
suspending them until new equipment enters
service. That ability to partner even in the most
challenging circumstances is one of the UK’s key
attributes and sources of influence


The future character of conflict

Globalisation increases the likelihood of conflict involving non-state and failed-state actors. State­
on-state conflict will not disappear, but its character is already changing. Asymmetric tactics such as
economic, cyber and proxy actions instead of direct military confrontation will play an increasing part,
as both state and non-state adversaries seek an edge over those who overmatch them in conventional
military capability. As a result, the differences between state-on-state warfare and irregular conflict are
dramatically reducing.

This will add to the pressures on military personnel and the government. It will be more difficult
to distinguish our enemies from the civilians, media, non-governmental organisations and allies also
present on the battlefield. We must expect intense scrutiny of our operations by a more transparent
society, informed by the speed and range of modern global communications.

Our enemies will continue to attack our physical and electronic lines of communication. And the
growth of communications technology will increase our enemies’ ability to influence, not only all
those on the battlefield, but also our own society directly. We must therefore win the battle for
information, as well as the battle on the ground.

This environment will place a premium on particular military capabilities, including intelligence,
surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance (ISTAR). It will demand sophisticated and resilient
communications and protected mobility by land, sea and air. It will also mean that our people
must continue to be our winning edge. We will need highly capable and motivated personnel with
specialist skills, including cultural understanding; strategic communications to influence and persuade;
and the agility, training and education to operate effectively in an increasingly complex environment.


-----

#### • [maintain collectively the ability to reconstitute ]
or regenerate capabilities we might need in
the future

#### • [invest in key technologies to ensure ]
regeneration at the appropriate technological
levels.

##### Principles

2.10 We will take a new approach to developing
and employing the Armed Forces, consistent with
the key elements of the adaptable posture set out
in Part One.

#### • [We will remain ready to use armed force where ]
necessary to protect our national interests.
Our future forces, although smaller than
now, will retain their geographical reach and
their ability to operate across the spectrum
from high-intensity intervention to enduring
stabilisation activity.

#### • [But we will be more selective in our use of the ]
Armed Forces, deploying them decisively at
the right time but only where key UK national
interests are at stake; where we have a clear
strategic aim; where the likely political, economic
and human costs are in proportion to the likely
benefits; where we have a viable exit strategy;
and where justifiable under international law.

#### • [The Armed Forces will focus more on tackling ]
risks before they escalate, and on exerting UK
influence, as part of a better coordinated overall
national security response. This will include:

– �a renewed emphasis on using our
conventional forces to deter potential
adversaries and reassure our partners,
including through military deployments to
demonstrate resolve and capability and
through joint exercises with partners

– �greater coordination of civilian and military
expertise in both conflict prevention and
crisis response – our integrated approach
to building stability overseas is set out in
section 4.B

– �a small permanent capability to enhance
cross-government homeland security
crisis response; these plans are set out in
section 4.D �


– �defence diplomatic engagement overseas
focussed on where it adds most value within
our overall approach, for example to support
operational activity or, where appropriate,
defence exports; Part Six gives further details.

#### • [We will maintain our ability to act alone where ]
we cannot expect others to help. But we will
also work more with our allies and partners
to share the burden of securing international
stability and ensure that collective resources
can go further. This will include: operational
cooperation; building the capacity of regional
partners to address common security interests
such as securing trade and energy supply routes;
and deepening relationships with those with
whom we can share capabilities, technologies
and programmes. These plans are set out in
Part Five.

#### • [We will invest in programmes that will provide ]
flexibility and advanced capabilities, and reduce
legacy capabilities which we are less likely to
need in a world of precision weaponry, and
where the battlespace increasingly involves
unmanned and cyber operations.

#### • [A full defence and security review at least every ]
five years will provide an additional mechanism
to maintain balance between resources,
commitments and future requirements as the
strategic context develops.

2.11 The Strategic Defence and Security Review
will deliver a major restructuring of the Armed
Forces in order to generate future military
capabilities that will be:

#### • [high-quality][, in training and equipment, with the ]
logistics, communications and other enablers
necessary for the tasks we plan to undertake

#### • [rigorously prioritised][, based on pragmatic ]
decisions about what we really need to maintain
and at what readiness, and the scale on which
we wish to operate

#### • [balanced][, with a broad spectrum of integrated ]
and sophisticated capabilities across the
maritime, land and air environments

#### • [efficient][, using the minimum number of ]
different equipment fleets, providing both
quality and effectiveness


-----

#### • [well-supported,][ both in a material and a ]
moral sense by the MOD, by other arms of
government, and by the public

#### • [flexible and adaptable][, to respond to ]
unexpected threats and rapid changes in
adversaries’ behaviour

#### • [expeditionary][, able to be deployed at distance ]
from the UK in order to tackle threats before
they reach these shores

#### • [connected][, able to operate with other parts ]
of government, international partners, civilian
agencies, and local security forces, authorities
and citizens in many parts of the world.

##### Military Tasks and Defence Planning Assumptions

2.12 Part One of the Strategic Defence and
Security Review sets out the new cross-cutting
National Security Tasks and Planning Guidelines,
which set requirements for the Armed Forces’
contribution to standing commitments, and
stabilisation and intervention operations.


2.13 Within the overall framework of the National
Security Tasks the contribution of the Armed
Forces is further defined through Military Tasks,
which describe what the Government may ask the
Armed Forces to undertake; and through more
detailed Defence Planning Assumptions, about the
size of the operations we plan to undertake, how
often we might undertake them, how far away
from permanent bases, with which partners and
allies, and how soon we expect to recover from the
effort involved. The Assumptions serve as a planning
tool to guide us in developing our forces rather than
a set of fixed operational plans or a prediction of
the precise operations that we will undertake.

2.14 The seven Military Tasks are:

#### • [defending the UK and its Overseas Territories ]
 • [providing strategic intelligence ]
 • [providing nuclear deterrence ]
 • [supporting civil emergency organisations in ]
times of crisis

#### • [defending our interests by projecting power ]


Operations

For planning purposes, operations are divided into:

#### • [standing commitments][, which are permanent operations essential to our security or to support ]
key British interests around the world

#### • [intervention operations][, which are short-term, high-impact military deployments, such as our ]
deployment to Sierra Leone in 2000

#### • [stabilisation operations][, which are longer-term mainly land-based operations to stabilise and ]
resolve conflict situations primarily in support of reconstruction and development and normally
in partnership with others, such as our continuing contribution to coalition operations in
Afghanistan.

Operations are further divided into:

#### • [non-enduring operations][, which last less than six months, typically requiring a force to be ]
deployed and then withdrawn without replacement. Examples might include evacuation of UK
citizens (as in Lebanon in 2006) or a counter-terrorist strike operation

#### • [enduring operations][, which last for more than six months and normally require units to carry out ]
a tour of duty and then be replaced by other similar units.

These descriptions help us to structure and scale our forces, rather than to plan for specific
operations. In reality there is considerable overlap between types of operation and our forces must
be flexible enough to adapt.


-----

strategically and through expeditionary
interventions �

#### • [providing a defence contribution to UK influence ]
 • [providing security for stabilisation. ]

2.15 The new Defence Planning Assumptions
envisage that the Armed Forces in the future will
be sized and shaped to conduct:

#### • [an enduring stabilisation operation at around ]
brigade level (up to 6,500 personnel) with
maritime and air support as required, while
also conducting:

#### • [one non-enduring complex intervention (up to ]
2,000 personnel), and

#### • [one non-enduring simple intervention (up to ]
1,000 personnel);

or alternatively:

#### • [three non-enduring operations if we were not ]
already engaged in an enduring operation;

or:

#### • [for a limited time, and with sufficient warning, ]
committing all our effort to a one-off
intervention of up to three brigades, with
maritime and air support (around 30,000,
two-thirds of the force deployed to Iraq in 2003).

2.16 We set out below the implications of our
approach and overall adaptable strategic posture for:

A. the size and shape of the Future Force

B. our people

C. the role of industry

D. how we will carry out the transition

E. how we will manage the risks.


##### A. Future Force 2020

2.A.1 The planning framework set out above
enables us to identify the Armed Forces we will
need over the next ten years, and the changes
that are required to deliver them. Drawing on the
Military Tasks and Planning Assumptions, we have
designed an outline force structure which we will
aim to deliver for the 2020s.

2.A.2 The Future Force has three broad elements:

#### • [The Deployed Force][ consists of those forces ]
engaged on operations. Today, this includes the
forces deployed in Afghanistan from the High
Readiness Force. It also includes those forces
which conduct permanent operations essential
to our security. These include, for example, the
aircraft providing UK air defence, our maritime
presence in the South Atlantic and the nuclear
deterrent.

#### • [The High Readiness Force][ allows us to react ]
rapidly to crises. This could include the UK’s
contribution to a multinational operation. But
the forces are held principally to allow us to
respond to scenarios in which we act alone
to protect our national security interests, for
example to conduct hostage rescue or counter­
terrorism operations. The force includes a
balanced range of highly capable land, air and
maritime capabilities able to meet our Defence
Planning Assumptions.

#### • [The Lower Readiness Force][ includes those ]
recently returned from operations which are
focussed on recovery and those preparing to
enter a period of high readiness. These forces
support enduring operations and can provide
additional flexibility, including where we have
discretion over the scale or duration of our
contribution to multinational operations.

Future Force 2020

Diagram.

Diagram.

The future force is structured to give us the ability to deploy highly capable assets quickly when we need to,
but also to prepare a greater scale and range of capability if required. The aim is to do so affordably and in a
way that minimises demands on our people. Five concepts are central to achieving the optimal effect:

#### • [Readiness][. We will hold a small number of our most capable units at high readiness. Doing so imposes ]
additional costs in terms of preparation and training, maintaining equipment ready to go, and having on
standby the enablers needed to deploy it rapidly. It places considerable demands on the personnel held at
high readiness and their families. The majority of our forces are held at graduated levels of lower readiness,
conducting their routine training cycle or recovering from deployment or periods of higher readiness,
making fewer demands on our equipment and stocks and under less constant pressure.

#### • [Reconstitution][. We will hold some capabilities at what is known as extended readiness. The capabilities will ]
not be available for operations in the short term but will be capable of being reconstituted if we have strategic
notice of possible, but low probability, events to which we might have to respond to protect our national
security. So for example, we will place elements of our amphibious capability in extended readiness rather
than remove them from the force structure entirely.

#### • [Reinforcement][. Reserve Forces will contribute to each element of the future force. They provide additional ]
capacity when regular forces are deployed at maximum effort. But they also provide specialists who it
would not be practical or cost-effective to maintain within the regular forces and who can be used to
augment smaller operational deployments – medical reservists play a vital role in Afghanistan, for example.

#### • [Regeneration][. We will maintain the ability to regenerate capabilities that we plan not to hold for the ]
immediate future. This will require plans to maintain technical expertise, keep skills and training going, and
work with allies and partners who do hold such capabilities and with whom we can, for example, exchange
personnel. We will have the capability to fly fast jets off maritime platforms when the new carrier and Joint
Strike Fighter enter service, but the capability will not be maintained when Harrier is retired so we will
need a plan to regenerate it.

#### • [Dependency][. We rarely deploy alone. We and our NATO Allies consciously depend on each other for ]
particular capabilities. For example, the UK does not have its own theatre missile defence capability, while we
have capabilities that are highly valued by coalition partners such as mine counter-measures vessels. Part Five
sets out our willingness and intention to deepen operational cooperation and potentially rely more on others
when it makes sense to do so. We also depend for some capabilities on the market – for example, we do not
hold all the shipping capacity we need since it is more efficient and effective to charter it when we need it.

This flexible approach will allow us more effectively to counter the threats we are most likely to face today
while maintaining the ability to respond to different threats in the future.


-----

##### Naval Forces

2.A.3 In the maritime environment, Future Force
2020 will be able to provide: nuclear Continuous
At Sea Deterrence; maritime defence of the UK
and its South Atlantic Overseas Territories; an
enduring presence within priority regions of the
world to contribute to conventional deterrence
and containment; powerful intervention capabilities
from our surface and submarine fleets; the ability
to land forces from the sea by helicopter and
over-the-beach with protective vehicles and
supplies from specialist ships; and the ability to
command UK and allied naval forces at up to
Task Force level.

2.A.4 Capabilities will include:

#### • [the Trident force and its supporting elements; ]
 • [the seven new Astute-class nuclear hunter-killer ]
submarines (SSNs), able to deploy rapidly from
the UK to operational areas, fuelled for 25
years and limited in endurance only by the food
they can carry. Capable of operating in secret
across the world’s oceans, they will contribute
to the protection of the nuclear deterrent
and maritime Task Groups and provide global
strategic intelligence and Tomahawk Land Attack
Missile strike capability. They are designed to
be adaptable throughout their operational lives,
with modular systems to reduce the costs of
future upgrades;

#### • [carrier-strike based around a single new ]
operational carrier with the second planned
to be kept at extended readiness. The carrier
will embark Joint Strike Fighters and helicopters
(see box overleaf);

#### • [a surface fleet of 19 frigates and destroyers, ]
providing military flexibility across a variety
of operations, from full-scale naval warfare,
to providing maritime security (for example
protecting trade and energy supplies) and
projecting UK influence (for example through


their visible presence or supporting building
the capacity of regional partners). These will
include six Type 45 destroyers, a highly capable
air defence destroyer whose missile system can
protect both naval forces and UK sovereign
territory, and the current Type 23 frigates.
Both ship types operate the Merlin helicopter
and the Type 45 can also operate the Chinook
helicopter. As soon as possible after 2020 the
Type 23 will be replaced by Type 26 frigates,
designed to be easily adapted to change roles
and capabilities depending on the strategic
circumstances;

#### • [the Royal Marines, whose 3 Commando Brigade ]
will provide one key element of our high
readiness Response Force. They will be able to
land and sustain a commando group of up to
1,800 personnel from the sea from a helicopter
platform and protective vehicles, logistics and
command and control support from specialist
ships, including landing and command ship. It
would allow us to conduct an operation such as
Sierra Leone in 2000;

#### • [a maritime helicopter force based around ]
Wildcat and Merlin helicopters, with numbers
aligned to the overall size of the future maritime
force structure. These will be capable of locating
and attacking enemy forces in both anti­
submarine and anti-surface warfare;

#### • [14 mine counter-measures vessels, based on ]
existing Hunt and Sandown class ships with a
replacement programme which will also have
the flexibility to be used for other roles such as
hydrography or offshore patrol. This capability
provides a significant level of security and
protection of the UK’s nuclear deterrent;

#### • [a global oceanographic survey capability and an ]
ice patrol ship;

#### • [a fleet of resupply and refuelling vessels scaled ]
to meet the Royal Navy’s requirements;


-----

#### • [maritime strategic transport provided by six ]
roll-on, roll-off ferries;

#### • [maritime intelligence, surveillance, target ]
acquisition and reconnaissance (ISTAR)
capabilities based on network enabled warships,
submarines and aircraft;

#### • [a streamlined Naval regional structure to ]
command reserve forces and represent the
Royal Navy throughout the UK.


2.A.5 We will accordingly:

#### • [decommission HMS Ark Royal immediately; ]
 • [reduce by four the number of frigates; ]
 • [place at extended readiness a landing and ]
command ship. Either HMS Ocean or HMS
Illustrious will be decommissioned following
a short study of which provides the most
effective helicopter platform capability.
A Bay-class amphibious support ship will
be decommissioned.


Aircraft carriers

Decisions on defence equipment require judgements on what our Armed Forces will need 20 to
30 years from now. That is particularly true for large warships like carriers and the fast jets that
fly off them. The previous Administration ordered two new carriers three times the size of our
existing ones. It planned to equip them from a combat air fleet of around 150 fifth generation Joint
Strike Fighters. This £20 billion programme was crowding out other important investment in the
Armed Forces.

The National Security Council has therefore looked hard at the strategic, industrial and financial
aspects of this programme, and has taken a number of difficult but necessary decisions to achieve
by the 2020s an adaptable and effective carrier-strike capability in balance with the rest of the
Armed Force structure. The key conclusions are:

#### • [There is a strategic requirement for a future carrier-strike capability][. The Invincible-class ]
carriers were designed principally to meet Cold War threats on the high seas, with short-range
jets providing air defence for a naval task group, without the ability to interoperate aircraft with
our key allies and whose primary mission was anti-submarine warfare. A Queen Elizabeth-class
carrier, operating the most modern combat jets, will give the UK the ability to project military
power more than 700 nautical miles over land as well as sea, from anywhere in the world.
Both the US and France, for example, have used this freedom of manoeuvre to deliver combat
airpower in Afghanistan from secure carrier bases in the Arabian Gulf and Indian Ocean. This
capability will give the UK long term political flexibility to act without depending, at times of
regional tension, on agreement from other countries to use of their bases for any mission we
want to undertake. It will also give us in-built military flexibility to adapt our approach over the
50 years of the carrier’s working life. In particular, it provides options for a coercive response to
crises, as a complement or alternative to ground engagements. It contributes to an overall Force
Structure geared towards helping deter or contain threats from relatively well-equipped regional
powers, as well as dealing with insurgencies and non-state actors in failing states.


-----

#### • [We will need to operate only one aircraft carrier][. We cannot now foresee circumstances in ]
which the UK would require the scale of strike capability previously planned. We are unlikely
to face adversaries in large-scale air combat. We are far more likely to engage in precision
operations, which may need to overcome sophisticated air defence capabilities. The single carrier
will therefore routinely have 12 fast jets embarked for operations while retaining the capacity to
deploy up to the 36 previously planned, providing combat and intelligence capability much greater
than the existing Harriers. It will be able to carry a wide range of helicopters, including up to 12
Chinook or Merlin transports and eight Apache attack helicopters. The precise mix of aircraft
will depend on the mission, allowing the carrier to support a broad range of operations including
landing a Royal Marines Commando Group, or a Special Forces Squadron conducting a counter­
terrorism strike, assisting with humanitarian crises or the evacuation of UK nationals.

#### • [A single carrier needs to be fully effective][. As currently designed, the Queen Elizabeth will not ]
be fully interoperable with key allies, since their naval jets could not land on it. Pursuit of closer
partnership is a core strategic principle for the Strategic Defence and Security Review because it
is clear that the UK will in most circumstances act militarily as part of a wider coalition. We will
therefore install catapult and arrestor gear. This will delay the in-service date of the new carrier
from 2016 to around 2020. But it will allow greater interoperability with US and French carriers
and naval jets. It provides the basis for developing joint Maritime Task Groups in the future. This
should both ensure continuous carrier-strike availability, and reduce the overall carrier protection
requirements on the rest of the fleet, releasing ships for other naval tasks such as protection of
key sea-lanes, or conducting counter- piracy and narcotics operations.

#### • [The strike needs to be made more capable][. Installing the catapult and arrestor will allow the ]
UK to acquire the carrier-variant of Joint Strike Fighter ready to deploy on the converted carrier
instead of the short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) variant. This version of the jet has a
longer range and greater payload: this, not large numbers of aircraft, is the critical requirement
for precision strike operations in the future. The UK plans to operate a single model of JSF,
instead of different land and naval variants. Overall, the carrier-variant of the JSF will be cheaper,
reducing through-life costs by around 25%.

#### • [The current, limited carrier-strike capability will be retired][. We must face up to the difficult ]
choices put off by the last Government. Over the next five years combat air support to
operations in Afghanistan must be the over-riding priority: the Harrier fleet would not be able
to provide this and sustain a carrier-strike role at the same time. Even after 2015, short-range
Harriers – whether operating from HMS Illustrious or HMS Queen Elizabeth – would provide
only a very limited coercive capability. We judge it unlikely that this would be sufficiently useful in
the latter half of the decade to be a cost-effective use of defence resources.

This new carrier-strike policy is consistent with the Strategic Defence and Security Review’s
overall approach of holding defence capabilities at different levels of readiness appropriate to the
strategic context. It makes strategic sense to focus on developing a more effective and appropriate
carrier-strike capability to deal with the uncertain evolution in type and scale of potential threats
from various states in the next decade and beyond. To provide further insurance against
unpredictable changes in that strategic environment, our current plan is to hold one of the two new
carriers at extended readiness. That leaves open options to rotate them, to ensure a continuous UK
carrier-strike capability; or to re-generate more quickly a two-carrier strike capability. Alternatively,
we might sell one of the carriers, relying on cooperation with a close ally to provide continuous
carrier-strike capability. The next strategic defence and security review in 2015 will provide an
opportunity to review these options as the future strategic environment develops. Retaining this
flexibility of choice is at the core of the Government’s adaptable approach.


-----

##### Land Forces

2.A.6 In the land environment, Future Force 2020
will be able to provide: light, specialist forces for
short-duration interventions; sufficient multi-role
forces to provide flexibility for larger or more
complex intervention operations or to undertake
enduring stabilisation operations; a contribution to
our standing commitments including defending the
South Atlantic Overseas Territories and UK tasks
such as bomb disposal; and the ability to command
UK and coalition forces at up to theatre level.

2.A.7 Capabilities will include:

#### • [five multi-role brigades (see box) each ]
comprising reconnaissance forces, tanks, and
armoured, mechanised and light infantry, plus
supporting units, keeping one brigade at high
readiness available for an intervention operation,
and four in support to ensure the ability to
sustain an enduring stabilisation operation;

#### • [16 Air Assault Brigade, a high-readiness, light, ]
short-duration intervention capability, organised
and trained for parachute and air assault
operations, with its own supporting units;

#### • [precision Guided Multiple Launch Rocket ]
System (GMLRS) rockets that can strike targets


up to 70 km away, and Loitering Munitions able
to circle over a battlefield for many hours ready
for fleeting or opportunity targets;

#### • [a new range of medium weight armoured ]
vehicles, including Terrier engineer vehicles and
the Scout reconnaissance vehicles and in due
course the Future Rapid Effects System Utility
Vehicle (FRES UV) which will be the core of the
Army’s armoured manoeuvre fleet;

#### • [protected support vehicles, replacing ]
unprotected versions that are no longer suitable,
to move logistic supplies around the battlefield;

#### • [heavily armoured vehicles, including Warrior ]
infantry fighting vehicle, AS90 artillery and
Titan and Trojan engineer vehicles and
Challenger tanks, in smaller numbers than
now but sufficient to conduct operations in
high-threat situations;

#### • [a range of ISTAR capabilities including: ]
Watchkeeper unmanned aerial vehicles; manportable and vehicle-fitted electronic warfare
equipment; deployable surveillance to protect
forward operating bases; and a force protection
system to protect against indirect fire such as
artillery and mortars;


New multi-role brigades

The Army’s five new multi-role brigades will consist of around 6,500 personnel and provide a wide
range of capabilities, allowing them to operate successfully across the variety of possible conflicts
that could arise over the next decades.

Key to the utility of these multi-role brigades is their building-block structure, allowing greater
choice in the size and composition of the force that might be deployed, without having to draw on
other elements from the rest of the Army as has been the case in recent times. Small groups from
within these brigades, such as an infantry battalion with minimal vehicles and supporting elements,
could be deployed quickly to evacuate British nationals such as in Lebanon in 2006. At the other
end of the scale and with suitable warning time, the brigades could be combined to generate a
larger formation suitable for full scale war.

The multi-role brigades will include: reconnaissance forces to gain information even in high-threat
situations; tanks, which continue to provide a unique combination of protection, mobility and
firepower; and infantry operating from a range of protected vehicles. The brigades will be selfsupporting, having their own artillery, engineer, communications, intelligence, logistics and medical
support. Territorial Army personnel will be fully integrated into the new structures, in both
specialist roles and reinforcing combat units.


-----

#### • [Army helicopters including: Apache attack ]
helicopters able to provide precision firepower
and ISTAR in support of ground forces; and
Wildcat helicopters for reconnaissance,
command and control, and escort duties;

#### • [the Military Stabilisation Support Group (MSSG) ]
which provides planning teams to support
military headquarters, and functional specialists
for reconstruction and development in support
of civilian stabilisation advisers, especially where
the security situation limits the deployment of
civilian teams. This will be part of the overall
integrated approach to building stability overseas
set out in section 4.B;

#### • [a range of capabilities to counter explosive ]
ordnance and IEDs;

#### • [a fully deployable divisional headquarters, with ]
a second headquarters capable of preparing
and training subordinate forces for operations
which could, with suitable warning, be
augmented to deploy in an operational role on
an enduring operation;

#### • [Headquarters Allied Rapid Reaction Corps ]
(ARRC) to command multinational forces across
a theatre of operations.

2.A.8 We will accordingly:

#### • [significantly reduce our non-deployable regional ]
administrative structure to enhance our focus
on front-line capabilities. We will replace our
four regional divisional headquarters with a
single UK support command, and close at least
two of our 10 regional brigade headquarters;

#### • [rationalise our deployable headquarters by ]
reducing the communications and logistics
support to Headquarters ARRC to reflect its
static rather than mobile role; and convert
the second of our operational divisional
headquarters to a force preparation role;

#### • [reduce by one the number of deployable ]
brigades, as we restructure towards five
multi-role brigades;

#### • [reduce our holdings of Challenger 2 main ]
battle tanks by around 40%. This is consistent
with our assessment of likely adversaries and
future types of conflict. However, the tank


roles from escorting convoys in high-threat IED
environments, deterring belligerents, through to
warfighting alongside international partners;

#### • [reduce our heavy artillery (AS90 armoured ]
artillery vehicles) by around 35%. Precision
ammunition allows us to strike targets with
one round rather than using tens of unguided
rounds. We can therefore reduce the number
of artillery pieces;

#### • [rationalise wider equipment holdings in the ]
light of experience on operations and improved
fleet management.

##### Air Forces

2.A.9 In the air environment, Future Force 2020
will be able to provide: air defence of the UK and
its South Atlantic Overseas Territories; a credible
and capable combat air presence to contribute
to conventional deterrence and containment; an
expeditionary combat air contribution to enduring
land operations; strategic and tactical airlift; and
other air power capabilities, including ISTAR,
helicopters and RAF Regiment ground units.

2.A.10 Capabilities will include:

#### • [a fast jet fleet of Typhoon and Joint Strike ]
Fighter aircraft (see box overleaf) with around
one third at high readiness. These are two of the
world’s most capable combat aircraft, able to
operate in the future high-threat airspace while
providing air defence, precision ground attack
and combat ISTAR capabilities;

#### • [a modern strategic and tactical airlift fleet based ]
on seven C-17, 22 A400M transport aircraft
and up to 14 specially converted Airbus A330
future strategic transport and Tanker aircraft
able rapidly to deploy, support and recover
our forces and their equipment anywhere in
the world and to provide airborne refuelling
to maximise the range and endurance of our
aircraft. It will replace the ageing TriStar and
VC10 fleets; the first aircraft is due to be
delivered towards the end of 2011;

#### • [12 new Chinook helicopters to increase ]
battlefield mobility from land and sea, operating
alongside Merlin medium lift helicopters to
move personnel and equipment quickly over l


-----

easier and more cost-effective to support and
will deliver significant operational advantages;

#### • [command and control capabilities to direct air ]
operations in the UK and overseas, centred
on the deployable Joint Force Air Component
Headquarters to command multinational forces
across a theatre of operations;

#### • [strategic surveillance and intelligence platforms ]
capable of providing wide-area coverage as part
of our broader combat ISTAR capability. These
include the E3D Sentry AWACS to provide
airborne command, control and surveillance;
Rivet Joint signals intelligence aircraft to provide
global independent strategic intelligence
gathering; and a range of unmanned air systems
to complement our strategic ISTAR assets and
reduce the risk to our forces of operating over
hostile territory;

#### • [the Storm Shadow cruise missile carried by our ]
current and future fast jets – a state of the art
capability to strike ground targets at medium to
long range;



#### • [advanced air launched weapons to ]
complement the capabilities of Typhoon and
Joint Strike Fighter;

#### • [enhancements to our simulated training to ]
produce a more efficient and cost-effective
training environment;

#### • [RAF Regiment Force Protection squadrons at ]
high readiness to protect deployed aircraft and
personnel in hostile areas;

#### • [chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear ]
(CBRN) detection, identification and
monitoring units.

2.A.11 We will accordingly:

#### • [in the transitional period, retain a reduced ]
Tornado fleet, but remove Harrier from
service in 2011 as the fast jet force moves to
two operational types – Joint Strike Fighter
and Typhoon. Retaining the Tornado fleet
allows a fast jet contribution to be sustained
in Afghanistan and support to concurrent
operations which would not have been possible
if Harrier was retained instead;


Fast jet fleets

Our fast jet fleet will be made up of two modern and highly capable multi-role combat aircraft,
Typhoon and Joint Strike Fighter. This combination will provide the flexibility and strike power to
deal with a variety of new and existing threats, while also radically improving cost-effectiveness and
efficiency.

Our current fleet of Harrier and Tornado air defence and ground attack aircraft have performed
magnificently over the last 30 years, and Tornados currently provide essential support to our forces
in Afghanistan and elsewhere. But these aircraft risk becoming outdated as threats continue to
become more varied and sophisticated, and maintenance of such veteran fleets will become an
increasing challenge. Rationalising our fast jet forces to two advanced and efficient fleets makes
operational and economic sense.

We will therefore continue to develop our modern and extremely capable land-based Typhoon
fighter, upgrading its ability to attack ground targets, and give it the additional advanced capabilities
it needs to maintain its fighting edge over the next 20 years. We will also buy the carrier variant of
the Joint Strike Fighter, a state-of the-art aircraft with an exceptionally broad range of capabilities,
and an expected service life of several decades. It is specifically designed to operate independently
in very challenging environments. It will carry a variety of electronic sensors to build up an
unmatched picture of the threats around it, which it will be able to share with other UK and allied
air, ground and maritime forces, linking into our future military networks. Joint Strike Fighter is also
designed to be more affordable across its operating life, benefitting from an expected production
run of more than 3,000 aircraft.


-----

#### • [reduce our planned number of Joint Strike ]
Fighter aircraft. Installing a catapult on the new
aircraft carrier will allow us to switch to the
more capable carrier variant;

#### • [not bring into service the Nimrod MRA4 ]
maritime patrol aircraft programme. We will
depend on other maritime assets to contribute
to the tasks previously planned for them;

#### • [withdraw the three variants of the TriStar ]
transport/tanker aircraft from service from 2013
as we transition to the more capable A330;

#### • [reduce the role of the VC-10 transport/tanker ]
aircraft to undertake air-to-air refuelling only,
with the target of withdrawing it by 2013 as
A330 enters service;

#### • [withdraw the C-130J Hercules tactical transport ]
aircraft from service by 2022, a decade earlier
than planned, as we transition to the larger and
more capable A400M aircraft;

#### • [withdraw the Sentinel airborne ground ]
surveillance aircraft once it is no longer required
to support operations in Afghanistan.

##### Reserves

2.A.12 Members of the reserve forces are
performing outstandingly well in Afghanistan.
There is a strong case for reviewing whether our
reserve forces are properly structured for the type
of conflict we envisage undertaking in future so
that we make best use of the skills, experience and
capabilities of our Reservists whilst at the same
time moving towards a more efficient structure.
We will therefore undertake a six month study
into the future role and structure of the Reserves
which will be undertaken by the leadership of
the regular and reserve forces. We will maintain
the important role of the tri-Service cadet and
university units.

##### Specialist capabilities

2.A.13 Our capabilities in each of the three
environments – maritime, land and air – and our
ability to integrate them and ensure they operate


effectively together depend upon a number of
joint enablers. These include command, control
and communications (C3), logistics, transport and
ISTAR. Preceding sections have set out some of
the key elements of Future Force 2020 for each of
these, including air transport and ISTAR capabilities.
We will invest further in information systems,
infrastructure and people that enable the sharing
of intelligence within defence and government and
with allies and partners. We will also develop our
wider information gathering capabilities such as
human and open-source intelligence.

2.A.14 We are significantly enhancing our Special
Forces capability. The Special Forces’ reputation is
widely acknowledged both in the UK and among
those allies and partners with whom we operate.
Special Forces contribute to a wide range of
intervention operations and provide vital support
to stabilisation operations and other commitments.
We will maintain the size of our regular Special
Forces front line units, and significantly enhance
support capabilities.

2.A.15 We will transform our cyber capabilities
within Defence by establishing a UK Defence
Cyber Operations Group as part of the
transformative cross-government approach set
out in section 4.C. Future conflict will see cyber
operations conducted in parallel with more
conventional actions in the maritime, land and air
environments. The Cyber Operations Group will
provide a cadre of experts to support our own
and allied cyber operations to secure our vital
networks and to guide the development of new
cyber capabilities. It will bring together existing
expertise from across Defence, including the
Armed Forces and our science and technology
community. It will ensure we plan, train, exercise
and operate in a way which integrates our
activities in both cyber and physical space; and be
responsible for developing, testing and validating
cyber capabilities as a complement to traditional
military capabilities. The Cyber Operations
Group will work closely with other government
departments and industry and help forge strong
international alliances to increase resilience and
joint operational capabilities.


-----

Overseas bases

We will maintain our network of permanent joint operating bases, including: in Gibraltar; in the
Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus; British Forces South Atlantic Islands, based on the Falkland Islands
and Ascension Island and maintaining a regular presence in South Georgia and South Sandwich
Islands; and on Diego Garcia in British Indian Ocean Territory. These bases give us and in some cases
our allies wide geographical reach and logistic support hubs for deployed forces. They will continue
to be central to our ability to deploy military force around the world and respond to changing
strategic circumstances.

We will also maintain our training areas in Canada, Kenya and Brunei. These help prepare our forces
for operations. They are also concrete manifestations of our close and valued defence relationships
with these countries.

The UK currently also has a major military presence in Germany, with 20,000 service personnel
and their families based there. For more than 50 years the Federal Government has supported
the British military presence providing essential training and operational opportunities as well as
basing. The presence of the British military has played an important role in demonstrating Alliance
solidarity, and has also been a symbol of steadfast UK-German friendship. But there is no longer any
operational requirement for UK forces to be based there, and the current arrangements impose
financial costs on the UK, disruption on personnel and their families and opportunity costs in terms
of wider Army coherence. We therefore aim to withdraw all forces from Germany by 2020.


##### Science and technology

2.A.16 We will continue the most essential
investment in Science and Technology. It is a key
element of our overall capability. Advanced military
technology can give us an advantage over potential
adversaries, for example developing UAV and
surveillance technology to inhibit an enemy’s ability
to move in secrecy. Rapid development of the
technological means to counter evolving threats
such as those from IEDs gives us an advantage
on the battlefield. We need to balance long-term
research focussed on potential future conflicts with
the immediate application of expertise on today’s
battlefields. Our experience in Afghanistan has
demonstrated how defence research can be pulled
quickly from the laboratory to the battlefield,
as well as developing future capabilities and
supporting the scientific aspects of our strategy,
policy and planning.

2.A.17 With constrained resources, and as
technology advances, we must try to maintain
an effective balance in our programmes and
maintain flexibility to adapt to the unexpected.
We will focus investment on developing capabilities
and countering threats in key areas, such as
autonomous systems, sensors, new materials


including nanotechnology, cyber and space. We
will maintain a lower level scientific overview of
others to anticipate technological shocks and to
spot opportunities. We will also maintain our
existing policy of close cooperation with the US
and our other NATO allies on ballistic missile
defences, and we intend to support proposals to
expand NATO’s role.

##### B. Our people

2.B.1 But these plans will only be effective if
we retain and develop high-quality and highly
motivated people. Our military advantage is, and
will remain, based on the skills, dedication and
professionalism of our personnel. Service men
and women accept the right and duty to apply
lethal force, and face through combat the risk of
death or life-changing injury. This principle sets the
Armed Forces apart from other professions.

2.B.2 In reorganising Defence we must properly
plan and provide a balance between equipment
and people. Our plans for the Armed Forces and
MOD civil servants are set out at section 2.D.
We recognise that the cumulative impact of the
changes in this Review will be difficult for our
people and their families.


-----

2.B.3 Honouring the commitments made in our
Coalition programme for government and in
recognition of the sacrifices our service men and
women make, we will rebuild and formalise an
Armed Forces Covenant. The Covenant represents
a promise of fair treatment, on behalf of the nation,
to ensure personnel are valued and respected as
individuals and that they and their families will be
sustained and rewarded by commensurate terms
and conditions of service. We cannot shield the
Armed Forces from the consequences of the
economic circumstances we face. However, we will
make progress where we can.

2.B.4 We have already doubled the operational
allowance for those serving in Afghanistan and
ensured that their opportunities for rest and
recuperation are maximised. We have also
taken steps to ensure that those injured, either
physically or mentally, receive the best possible
care. However, we are clear that the scope of
the Covenant needs to address the full range of
issues affecting service personnel and their families,
not just the specific demands associated with
operations. We will therefore pursue a number
of measures, including the provision of support
for ex-service personnel to study at university
and provide university and further education
scholarships for the children of service personnel
killed on active service since 1990.

2.B.5 In addition, earlier this year we set up the
independent Armed Forces Covenant Task Force
led by Professor Hew Strachan to identify innovative
answers to the most difficult problems facing serving
and former service personnel and their families. The
Task Force has also examined approaches involving
the private and charitable sectors. It has identified
and assessed fresh ways of thinking about how the
Government and society as a whole can fulfil its
obligations to rebuild the military covenant and will
report by mid-November.

2.B.6 Central to delivering this pledge is ensuring
that the whole of government supports our
personnel, both serving and retired, and their
families, so that their service is properly recognised
rather than a cause of disadvantage. This
obligation is not simply a moral imperative, it is
fundamental to our ability to recruit and retain
sufficient numbers of highly motivated and capable


2.B.7 The current package of Terms and
Conditions of Service is costly, complex and does
not align sufficiently the requirements of the
Services with the reasonable demands of our
people and their families. We will update it. For the
longer term, we will develop a New Employment
Model. This will include a different approach to
the provision of accommodation which will better
meet future needs for affordable and good quality
housing during and after service.

2.B.8 In changing the employment model, we
must ensure that service in the Armed Forces
remains an attractive choice in a rapidly evolving
employment market. The overall package
including career structure, pay, allowances and
accommodation options needs to be simpler
to administer, more cost effective, offer
greater choice and encourage greater personal
responsibility. It should better balance the demands
placed on our people and their families, providing
the greater domestic stability which is central to
spouses’ employment and children’s education,
while continuing to support mobility where this is
essential to Defence requirements.

2.B.9 We must maintain and further develop the
medical support provided by the Defence Medical
Services and the NHS, and the social care, to
ensure the health of our people and treat those
who are ill or injured. It is vital that this includes
properly planned and supported transition from
military to civilian life. The provision of healthcare
to Service personnel will be enhanced by an extra
£20 million per year. This will be used to pay
for additional medical staff and to deliver better
mental healthcare facilities.

2.B.10 The Defence Medical Services play a vital
role in sustaining the health of our people and
their fitness. The confidence instilled by the high
standards of medical care delivered on operations
is a key component of morale. We must build on
the experience and knowledge we have gained at
every stage of the patient’s journey and in every
aspect of the care that must be delivered. At a
time of radical reform of the Health Service, we
will work very closely with our colleagues in the
NHS who lead the delivery of secondary care for
personnel in the UK.


-----

2.B.11 We also welcome Dr Andrew Murrison’s
report, ‘Fighting Fit: a Mental Health Plan for
Service Personnel and Veterans’, and strongly
endorse its key themes and recommendations.
We will be taking forward work on Dr Murrison’s
proposals and are putting into place two of his key
recommendations immediately: a dedicated 24
hour support line for veterans and 30 additional
mental health nurses in Mental Health Trusts
to ensure that the right support is provided to
veterans. We believe these measures and his
other recommendations will make a significant
contribution to honouring the Armed Forces
Covenant by providing additional support to
both serving personnel and veterans with mental
health issues.

2.B.12 We will continue to look at options for
improving training across the Services. This
will include how to make the best use of the
investment already made at St Athan.

2.B.13 MOD civil servants play a critical role in
defence. They support Ministers in determining
policy and strategy; in managing the resources
allocated by Parliament; and in maintaining our key­
cross-government and international relationships.
They also perform a range of vital roles in front
line support to operations, from manning the
Royal Fleet Auxiliary and providing fire safety, to
scientific knowledge, contracts expertise, logistics
support, intelligence capabilities and policy advice.

##### C. Industry

2.C.1 We will ensure that our Armed Forces
are provided with the equipment and support
they require when they need it in the UK and on
operations. At the same time, we expect defence
expenditure to demonstrate value for money. Our
relationship with industry is crucial to achieving
both objectives. But MOD spending also has a
broader economic impact – MOD spent nearly
£19 billion in 2009 with UK suppliers and it has
been estimated that some 300,000 UK jobs are
supported by defence spending and exports.
Industrial policy provides the link between these
key issues.


2.C.2 We will therefore publish a Green Paper
by the end of this year, setting out our intended
approach to industrial policy and to the closely
related issue of technology policy. Following
consultation in the early part of next year, we will
publish a White Paper that formalises Defence
Industrial and Technology policy for the five
years until the next strategic review. This will set
the strategic context and give industry clarity and
confidence about our future plans by updating,
in the light of the Strategic Defence and Security
Review, our approach to the industrial sectors
that support key military capabilities. The choices
we have made about the future structure of the
UK Armed Forces will result in changes to our
equipment and support requirements and therefore
to what MOD will be buying from industry.

2.C.3 We will aim to use open competition on the
global market for many of our major acquisitions,
but we will take other approaches where this is
appropriate or necessary. We will continue to
ensure that private sector skills and technologies
are protected where these are essential to
maintaining sovereignty in the use of our Armed
Forces. But as set out in Part Five, we will also
seek opportunities for international collaboration,
for example where common requirements or
complementary technological capabilities will
enhance efficiency or effectiveness.

2.C.4 We will aim to support the small and
medium-sized enterprises that are a vital source
of innovation and flexibility. We will also promote
defence exports to secure economic and security
benefits (see Part Six), including by designing new
equipment with exportability in mind.

##### D. Transition

2.D.1 The decisions set out in this Review will
require a major and challenging programme
of change, made more difficult by the financial
and operational context. We will carry out this
transition responsibly, ensuring that our operations
in Afghanistan are prioritised, maintaining at all
times forces capable of responding to crises and
retaining as far as possible the ability to regenerate


-----

capabilities should they be required. Over the
Spending Review period we will:

#### • [make no changes to Army or Royal Marines ]
combat units involved in Afghanistan operations

#### • [extend the life of the Puma helicopter to ]
continue its operational contribution

#### • [postpone planned changes in other key ]
capabilities, such as the RAF’s Sentinel ground
surveillance aircraft for as long as they are
required to support the forces on the ground

#### • [ensure we maintain at all times our ability to ]
undertake our essential permanent tasks such as
defence of the UK and our Overseas Territories

#### • [maintain our ability to support our operations ]
across all parts of MOD, for example the teams
responsible for acquiring equipment as urgent
operational requirements in our equipment
organisation.

2.D.2 Equally, where it makes sense to do so,
we will accelerate change, bringing forward the
withdrawal of legacy capabilities and expediting
modernisation programmes. We will consciously
accept capability gaps in the interim where we
judge we can bear the risk.

##### The resource challenge of transition

2.D.3 The legacy of over-commitment in the
Defence programme amounted to around
£38 billion. Some £20 billion of this is related
to unaffordable plans for new equipment and
support. Cancelling or changing major contracts to
tackle this problem itself creates further liabilities.
Negotiation with industry will reduce these as
much as possible, but they will still make the
short-term financial challenge greater.

2.D.4 In addition, there are systemic pressures
in the two key blocks of Defence expenditure
– equipment and personnel. On the basis of
experience in the UK and internationally, if we
continue to search for a technological edge,
including improved protection for our personnel,
we can expect the cost of successive generations
of equipment to continue to rise. On average,
military pay is increasing at between 1 and 2%
above the rate of inflation. This is not unique to


Defence – the increases are in line with average
UK earnings – but it needs to be properly
recognised in our plans. Pension contributions,
allowances and the costs of accommodation
are also increasing at rates above inflation. We
have incorporated a more realistic assessment of
financial risk in these areas during the Spending
Review which will place the budget on a more
sustainable footing than in the past. But we will
need to remain alert to these issues and take
action where necessary.

2.D.5 This legacy of unaffordability, and these
systemic pressures, mean that a major focus of
work in the Strategic Defence and Security Review
has been to eliminate over-commitment, to the
greatest extent possible by reducing running costs
to allow resources to be focussed on the front line.
This has identified new non-front line savings of at
least £4.3 billion over the Spending Review period.
The key areas are:

#### • [reductions in the civilian workforce and ]
non-front line service personnel (see below)

#### • [rationalisation of the defence estate including ]
the sale of surplus land and buildings and
associated running cost reductions (see below)
and running cost savings across the estate of
up to £350 million per year including a revised
approach to the way in which we manage and
deliver infrastructure services across the estate

#### • [sales of assets such as the Defence Support ]
Group and the Marchwood Sea Mounting
Centre and the Defence stake in the
telecommunications spectrum, should generate
in excess of £500 million over the Spending
Review period

#### • [efficiencies and improvements in military ]
training, including the increased use of simulators
for air-crew and Army live firing

#### • [saving significant amounts from contract ]
re-negotiations with defence industry

#### • [cutting over £300 million per year by 2014/15 ]
of service and civilian personnel allowances

#### • [reductions in our spend on commodities, ]
including substantial savings on food, energy and
professional services


-----

#### • [reductions in spend on media and ]
communications �

#### • [overall, this represents a 25% reduction in ]
non-frontline organisations such as
headquarters, support roles and organisations
such as Defence Equipment and Support, saving
at least £2 billion per year by 2014/15.

##### Personnel transition

2.D.6 We plan to make total reductions of around
17,000 service personnel by 2015:

#### • [the ][Royal Navy][ will decrease by around 5,000 ]
personnel to a total of c.30,000

#### • [the ][Army][ by around 7,000 to c.95,000 ]
 • [the ][RAF][ by around 5,000 personnel to c.33,000. ]

2.D.7 We are undertaking detailed work to
identify the timing of these changes. While some
service manpower reductions will be managed
through natural turnover, some will need to leave
through redundancy. We must continue to recruit
in many areas even as reductions in numbers
progress, avoiding the mistakes of the past that
have led to critical skills shortages in some roles,
and maintaining a coherent mix of trained and
experienced personnel for the future. We will
ensure that those who leave are treated fairly.

2.D.8 These adjustments can be achieved without
impacting on operations in Afghanistan. Further
work is required to determine the numbers of
personnel that will be required to man the 2020
Force Structure. The Defence Reform Review,
the review of Reserve Forces, further efficiency
measures and changes in the policy context will
all need to be taken into account at the next
Strategic Defence and Security Review, which will
set out detailed plans for the five years beyond
2015. In contrast to the position we inherited, our
long-term planning will ensure we are able to fully
man and equip the deployable force structure
to achieve the Defence Planning Assumptions
described in paragraph 2.16. We will also, for now,
assume that by 2020 we will require a Royal Navy
of 29,000 personnel, an Army of 94,000 and an
RAF of 31,500.


2.D.9 The MOD Civil Service will decrease by
25,000 to 60,000 by 2015, as the requirement
for civilian support decreases in line with
the development of new force structures,
restructuring of defence capabilities, rationalisation
of the defence estate and realisation of other
non-front line savings. These significant reductions
will be managed through natural turnover and
a near freeze on external recruitment; an early
release programme will also be required. Detailed
proposals to deliver the changes, while retaining
key Defence skills, will be brought forward in
consultation with the Department’s trades union.

##### Bases

2.D.10 For generations, up and down the country,
many communities have given outstanding support
to the Armed Forces. Nowhere is this truer than
in Portsmouth and Devonport. Although the
measures set out in this White Paper will require
some changes at both locations, we will have a
continuing requirement to sustain both bases.
In the longer-term, the two new carriers will be
based in Portsmouth.

2.D.11 The rationalisation in Army command
structures and the reductions in, for example,
tanks and heavy artillery will eliminate the
requirement for some locations and reduce the
infrastructure required at others. Our current
estate is widely dispersed across the UK in a
manner which owes more to history than to
its efficient use. This dispersal creates costs
and reduces stability for service personnel. We
therefore intend to use the opportunity of these
major changes to develop a more coherent and
cost-effective solution.

2.D.12 In particular, we aim to accelerate the
re-basing of our forces from Germany, ending
the legacy UK Armed Forces presence. There
are currently 20,000 personnel in Germany,
many accompanied by families, and the basing
arrangements impose significant disruption
to personnel, opportunity costs in terms of
wider Army coherence, and financial costs on
the Department (for example, through health,
education and allowances). We therefore aim to
return half our personnel in Germany to the UK
by 2015 and the remainder by 2020.


-----

2.D.13 The withdrawal of Nimrod MRA4 and
Harrier, as well as the reduction in size of the
Tornado fleet, will mean that Kinloss and two
other bases will no longer be required by the
RAF. However, we have not made decisions on
the future use of any of these bases. It is likely
that some of the estate vacated as a result of the
changes announced in this White Paper will be
used by units returning from Germany or retained
for other purposes.

2.D.14 Our final decisions on the defence estate
that we will need in 2020 will be taken on the basis
of detailed investment appraisals and wider impact
assessments. We plan to be as open as we can
be and to take decisions as quickly as possible in
order to minimise uncertainty for the communities
affected. Our aim will be that our Armed Forces
will continue to be based in a way which is sensitive
to economic and social pressures and the needs of
defence, our people and their families.

##### Efficiency and defence reform

2.D.15 We have, in parallel with the Strategic
Defence and Security Review, started a further full
and fundamental review of how the Ministry of
Defence is run and how we can reform the Armed
Forces in order to deliver Defence capability
and generate and sustain military operations as
efficiently as possible.

2.D.16 Defence has made substantial cost savings
in recent years and will be required to make more.
However there is a need to go much further to
ensure that every pound spent maximises our
capability. The Secretary of State for Defence
announced the launch of the Defence Reform
Review on 13 August. The work will be overseen
by a Defence Reform Unit, a steering group of
senior experts with extensive public and private
sector experience, chaired by the independent and
very experienced Lord Levene.

2.D.17 The purpose of the Defence Reform
Review is two-fold. First, it will identify ways of
creating a simpler and more effective Defence
organisation, which is better able to deal with
current and future challenges. Equally importantly,
it will contribute to the Department’s delivery
of significant reductions in the running costs of
Defence The Defence Reform Review will take


account of the decisions in the Strategic Defence
and Security Review on force structures and
capabilities, and considerable previous work within
the Department to identify ways of bearing down
on costs, seek improved value for money and
greater efficiency in every aspect of Defence,
particularly in the supporting areas.

2.D.18 The scope of the Defence Reform Review
will be wide-ranging. In developing a new, more
cost-effective model for the management of
Defence, it will examine closely all the major areas
of Defence: policy, strategy and finance; the Armed
Forces, with a particular focus on non front-line
elements; and acquisition, commercial, estates and
corporate services. The Defence Reform Review
will also look at a range of cross-cutting issues,
such as whether the current senior rank structure
across the Services is appropriate.

2.D.19 We will also review how the Armed
Forces undertake the tasks of force generation
and sustainability. We need to challenge some of
the fundamental assumptions which drive force
generation, such as tour lengths and intervals,
taking into account the varying pressures on our
personnel resulting from widely varying missions
to see if we can update our practices and produce
greater efficiency. The Single Service Chiefs will
begin this review immediately, with a view to
completing their work by the spring of 2011.

##### E. Risk

2.E.1 We have assessed the risks associated
with this transition. We recognise that we will
be undertaking major change, while conducting
a challenging operation. The cumulative impact
will impose major strains upon personnel and
organisations. Some gaps in capabilities will create
temporary risks and vulnerabilities, particularly
where we are withdrawing one capability in
advance of its successor’s entry into service. And
the future is uncertain, so we might need to react
to the unexpected. We will manage these risks by:

#### • [ensuring that our operations in Afghanistan are ]
prioritised (as set out in section 2.D.1);

#### • [maintaining our military ][strategic intelligence ]
capability. We must be able to identify new and
emerging military risks as part of our overall


-----

approach to intelligence set out in Parts Four
and Six;

#### • [ensuring that we have ][adaptable][ capabilities ]
in the maritime, land and air domains, and in
our strategic enablers, contributing to a widest
possible range of military scenarios;

#### • [deepening ][partnerships][ so that we can manage ]
risks and do more together when threats
emerge – our focus will be on initiatives that
will generate tangible operational benefits or
real cost savings, not on cooperation for its
own sake;

#### • [preserving the ability to ][reconstitute][ our levels ]
of military capability in areas which are currently
low priority, such as heavy armour – tanks –
should international circumstances change. This
means both holding in reserve certain sorts of
equipment not needed for current operations
and – importantly – maintaining core levels of
training and experience among our personnel.
This would provide us with the potential for
expansion in the future;

#### • [maintaining a minimum effective ][strategic ]
deterrent against the most extreme future
threats that might emerge. Part Three sets this
out in full.


-----

# Part three.


-----

### The Deterrent

3.1 The National Security Tasks and Planning
Guidelines set out the need for a minimum
effective nuclear deterrent as the ultimate
means to deter the most extreme threats. In
parallel with the Strategic Defence and Security
Review we have conducted a review of our
nuclear declaratory policy, and scrutinised Trident
replacement to ensure value for money, including
the scope for further reductions in the scale of
our nuclear weapons capability. The conclusions
are set out below.

##### The strategic context

3.2 No state currently has both the intent and
the capability to threaten the independence or
integrity of the UK. But we cannot dismiss the
possibility that a major direct nuclear threat to the
UK might re-emerge – a state’s intent in relation
to the use or threat of use of its capabilities could
change relatively quickly, and while we will continue
to work internationally to enhance mutual trust
and security, we cannot rule out a major shift in
the international security situation which would
put us under grave threat.

3.3 Despite the success of the Treaty on the Non
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) over
the last 40 years in limiting the number of states
with nuclear capabilities, large arsenals remain and
the risk of nuclear proliferation continues. We
cannot discount the possibility that the number of
states armed with nuclear weapons might increase.
Equally there is a risk that some countries might
in future seek to sponsor nuclear terrorism. We
must not allow such states to threaten our national
security or to deter us and the international
community from taking the action required to


maintain regional and global security.

3.4 It is also important to recognise that the UK’s
nuclear deterrent supports collective security
through NATO for the Euro-Atlantic area; nuclear
deterrence plays an important part in NATO’s
overall strategy and the UK’s nuclear forces make a
substantial contribution.

##### Nuclear weapons policy

3.5 At the beginning of this Parliament, the Foreign
Secretary announced a review of our nuclear
declaratory policy to ensure that it is appropriate
to the political and security context in 2010 and
beyond. The UK has long been clear that we
would only consider using our nuclear weapons in
extreme circumstances of self defence, including
the defence of our NATO Allies, and we remain
deliberately ambiguous about precisely when, how
and at what scale we would contemplate their use.

3.6 As a responsible nuclear weapon state and
party to the NPT, the UK also remains committed
to the long term goal of a world without nuclear
weapons. We will continue to work to control
proliferation and to make progress on multilateral
disarmament, to build trust and confidence
between nuclear and non-nuclear weapon states,
and to take tangible steps towards a safer and
more stable world where countries with nuclear
weapons feel able to relinquish them.

3.7 We are now able to give an assurance that
the UK will not use or threaten to use nuclear
weapons against non-nuclear weapon states
parties to the NPT. In giving this assurance, we
emphasise the need for universal adherence to
and compliance with the NPT and note that this


-----

assurance would not apply to any state in material
breach of those non-proliferation obligations. We
also note that while there is currently no direct
threat to the UK or its vital interests from states
developing capabilities in other weapons of mass
destruction, for example chemical and biological,
we reserve the right to review this assurance if the
future threat, development and proliferation of
these weapons make it necessary.

##### Value for money

3.8 In December 2006, the previous Government
published The Future of the United Kingdom’s
_Nuclear Deterrent White Paper (Cm6994). In_
March 2007 Parliament voted to retain a minimum
nuclear deterrent based on the current Trident
missile delivery system. Under the previous
Government, work started on a programme to
replace the current Vanguard class submarines
when they leave service in the late 2020s. In May
this year the Coalition programme for government
stated that ‘we will maintain Britain’s nuclear
deterrent, and have agreed that the renewal of
Trident will be scrutinised to ensure value for
money. Liberal Democrats will continue to make
the case for alternatives’. The value for money
review has now been completed.

3.9 The Government will maintain a continuous
submarine-based deterrent and begin the work of
replacing its existing submarines. We will therefore
proceed with the renewal of Trident and the
submarine replacement programme, incorporating
the savings and changes set out below. The first
investment decision (Initial Gate) will be approved,
and the next phase of the project commenced, by
the end of this year.

3.10 The review has concluded that the overall
cost of the submarine and warhead replacement
programmes and associated infrastructure remains
within the £20 billion cost estimate foreseen in
2006 at 2006 prices. To drive value for money
we will:

#### • [defer decisions on a replacement to the ]
current warhead

#### • [reduce the cost of the replacement submarine ]
missile compartment



#### • [extend the life of the current Vanguard class ]
submarines and re-profile the programme to
build replacement submarines

#### • [consequently, take the second investment ]
decision (Main Gate) finalising the detailed
acquisition plans, design and number of
submarines around 2016

#### • [work with British industry to improve efficiency ]
and optimise to expected demand its capacity to
build and support submarines.

As a result of our reassessment of the minimum
necessary requirements for credible deterrence
we will:

#### • [reduce the number of warheads onboard each ]
submarine from 48 to 40

#### • [reduce our requirement for operationally ]
available warheads from fewer than 160 to no
more than 120

#### • [reduce our overall nuclear weapon stockpile to ]
no more than 180

#### • [reduce the number of operational missiles on ]
each submarine.

The overall impact of the changes identified by the
value for money review will be to reduce costs by
£3.2 billion, saving approximately £1.2 billion and
deferring spending of up to £2 billion from the
next 10 years; we expect some of the deferred
spend ultimately to be translated into real savings
in later years. These savings do not alter in any way
the nature and credibility of the nuclear deterrent,
including maintenance of Continuous At Sea
Deterrence. Further detail is set out below.

##### Scale

3.11 The Government has concluded that we can
meet the minimum requirement of an effective
and credible level of deterrence with a smaller
nuclear weapons capability. We will therefore
cut the maximum number of nuclear warheads
onboard each deployed submarine from 48 to 40.
Together with improved stockpile management,
that will reduce our requirement for operationally
available warheads from fewer than 160 to no
more than 120. We will also reduce the number
of operational missiles on the Vanguard class


-----

submarines to no more than eight. These changes
will start to take effect over the next few years.
This will enable us to reduce our overall nuclear
warhead stockpile ceiling from not more than 225
to not more than 180 by the mid 2020s.

##### Replacement warheads

3.12 Since 2006, work has been progressing
in order to determine the optimum life of the
existing warhead stockpile and the range of
replacement options. Under the 1958 UK-US
Agreement for Cooperation on the Uses of
Atomic Energy for Mutual Defence Purposes (the
‘Mutual Defence Agreement’) we have agreed on
the future of the Trident D5 delivery system and
determined that a replacement warhead is not
required until at least the late 2030s. Decisions
on replacing the warhead will not therefore be
required in this Parliament. This will defer £500
million of spending from the next 10 years. We
have also reached agreement with the US over the
size of the missile tubes in the new submarines;
this has enabled us to reduce the cost of the
submarine missile compartment by up to £250
million.

##### Submarines

3.13 We have reviewed the scope to extend the
life of the existing Vanguard class submarines and
have concluded that, with sufficient investment,
we can safely operate them into the late 2020s
and early 2030s. This affords us the opportunity
to adjust the build programme of the replacement
submarines to match, reducing cost in the shortterm with the aim of delivering the first new
submarine in 2028. Later this year detailed design
work on the new class of submarines will begin.
This will provide the information needed in order
to determine whether maintaining continuous at
sea deterrence would require four submarines,
or a fleet of only three. A decision on submarine
numbers would be required at the Main Gate
point of our acquisition programme, around 2016.


3.14 We have also determined that the next
generation of submarines can be configured with
only eight operational missile tubes, rather than
the 16 on the current Vanguard class. Together
with the US, we will now proceed with a common
design for the missile compartment that provides
that capacity.

##### Industry and infrastructure

3.15 The value for money work has also examined
the organisations and infrastructure that support
our deterrent to ensure that they are as efficient
as possible. We have identified a number of areas
where spending can be reduced and in some cases
deferred in order to minimise expenditure. As
a result, we have agreed to defer and potentially
to remove over £1 billion of future spending on
infrastructure over the next 10 years.

3.16 Across the whole of the nuclear defence
programme we will be working closely with
our industrial suppliers to improve commercial
arrangements and efficiency. Under this Submarine
Enterprise Performance Programme we expect to
deliver substantial savings of at least £900 million
over the next 10 years.

### Wider Security

4.1 The National Security Risk Assessment set
out a wide range of risks. The National Security
Council has enabled the Government to ensure
that all parts of government are integrated in
dealing with security issues.

4.2 The Risk Assessment identified wider security
risks we should give greatest priority to, based
upon their relative likelihood and impact. These
include three of the four Tier One risks (terrorism,
cyber security and civil emergencies in the form
of natural hazards or accidents) as well as other
important issues:

A. Terrorism
B. Instability and conflict overseas

C. Cyber security
D. Civil emergencies

E. Energy security

F. Organised crime

G. Border security
H. Counter proliferation and arms control.

4.3 In the following sections, we set out how
we will put in place the adaptable approach to
implementing our new set of National Security
Tasks and Planning Guidelines (see Part One)
to tackle these risks. In each case, we focus on
the specific changes the Government will be
introducing, and how these can be achieved within
the available resources.


##### A. Terrorism

4.A.1 Terrorism is a Tier One risk in the National
Security Risk Assessment. The most significant
terrorist threat to the UK and its interests overseas
comes from the Al Qaeda senior leadership based
in the border areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan,
and their affiliates and supporters. The current
threat to the UK from international terrorism is
judged to be Severe, meaning that an attack in
this country is highly likely. The threat is becoming
more diverse as groups affiliated to and inspired
by Al Qaeda develop more autonomy in directing
operations. As such we are likely to see a more
unpredictable picture in the future, potentially with
more frequent, albeit less sophisticated attacks.

4.A.2 The threat from residual terrorism linked
to Northern Ireland is a growing concern. There
is a calculated campaign of violence from small
dissident republican groups. Despite continuing
political progress, their activities have increased
in the last 18 months and the security situation is
unlikely to improve in the short term. There have
been 37 attacks this year, compared with 22 in all
of 2009. The ongoing recruitment of experienced
terrorists and a younger generation will contribute
to a continued high level of threat in Northern
Ireland, as well as in Great Britain where the
threat level was recently raised from Moderate
to Substantial, meaning that an attack is a strong
possibility.


-----

4.A.3 While we cannot eliminate terrorism, we
can reduce the risk to the UK and our interests
overseas. The National Security Tasks and
Guidelines in Part One set out an approach that
tackles terrorism at every stage and integrates our
domestic and overseas work: pursuing terrorists
through assessed intelligence, investigations and
disruptions in the UK and overseas; preventing
people from becoming terrorists; and protecting
critical national infrastructure and crowded places.
In the event of an attack we can ensure we are
prepared by having robust crisis management
measures in place.

4.A.4 Following a rigorous analysis of our current
approach, this section sets out the specific changes
we will make to our counter-terrorism work.
We will continue to give high priority to counter­
terrorism compared to other areas of national
security, and public policy more generally. We will
therefore ensure that our key counter-terrorism
capabilities are maintained and in some areas
enhanced. We will:

#### • [continue to prioritise the counter-terrorism ]
elements of policing. We will maintain core
capabilities in counter-terrorism policing which
are crucial to countering the threat from
terrorism, while introducing efficiency savings.
These efficiency savings will be achieved by
greater prioritisation of policing efforts, the
reorganisation of headquarters and wider police
reform. The Home Office has worked closely
with the police to ensure that resources can
be adapted to changing demands and, where
appropriate, to identify areas for savings;

#### • [continue to invest in a range of covert ]
intelligence capabilities to enable us to identify,
investigate and disrupt terrorist activity at
the earliest possible stage. The intelligence
community will work together to achieve
this, including the Security Service leading
investigations in the UK, the Secret Intelligence
Service (SIS) using its global network to provide
insights into terrorist activity overseas and the
Government Communications Headquarters
(GCHQ) bringing its technical and analytical
capabilities to bear;

#### • [deliver a safe and secure Olympic and ]
Paralympic Games in 2012 We have been


able to identify some efficiency savings that will
ensure that this programme is as cost-effective
as possible;

#### • [continue to support the devolved institutions ]
of Northern Ireland, which are endorsed by
the people of Northern Ireland. Alongside our
objective for wider social, economic and political
progress in Northern Ireland we will pursue
and develop a strategy to tackle the threat from
terrorism. We will work with the devolved
administration and the Irish Government to
defeat the terrorists who threaten stability
and prosperity. We will publish any changes
to the threat assessment in the interests of
transparency and to encourage vigilance.

4.A.5 We have identified areas in which we need
to adapt our strategy for countering international
terrorism (CONTEST) in order that our approach
is proportionate, focussed and effective. We will:

#### • [review our most sensitive and controversial ]
counter-terrorism and security powers and,
where possible and consistent with protecting
the public, provide a correction in favour of
liberty. This is being undertaken as part of a
broader programme of work to enhance our
civil liberties. We expect to amend some of the
powers which have been developed since 9/11
where doing so will make them more effective
and less intrusive;

#### • [reform the counter-radicalisation workstream of ]
the CONTEST strategy. We will review this area,
with a view to separating it much more clearly
than before from general communities policy.
The Department for Communities and Local
Government will work to encourage a more
integrated society, separate from CONTEST,
while the Office for Security and CounterTerrorism (based in the Home Office) will be
responsible for a more focussed Prevent Strategy.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)
will continue to focus on counter-ideology and
counter-radicalisation overseas, in regions that
pose the greatest threat to the UK;

#### • [enhance the firearms capabilities of police ]
armed response units this year, and support
their work with specialist military units to


-----

Implications of the Strategic Defence and Security Review for intelligence
Our adaptable approach to national security will require that our intelligence capabilities continue to support our
core military, diplomatic, security and domestic resilience requirements and our economic prosperity, boosting
our ability to meet objectives in all of the National Security Tasks and Planning Guidelines. We need to maintain
flexible capabilities to respond to changing pressures and priorities.

The UK’s intelligence community includes the three security and intelligence agencies – the Government
Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) and the Security Service – as
well as Defence Intelligence (DI), the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre
(JTAC) and intelligence staff in other government departments, all operating within a strict legal and oversight
framework.

As a result of the decisions taken in the Strategic Defence and Security Review, the intelligence agencies will be
able to continue to invest in counter-terrorism capabilities as well as other key national security objectives like
countering proliferation. It also provides a sufficient technical platform for the cyber security programme. To
allow us to focus on these highest priorities at a time of constrained responses, as well as meeting the challenge
of keeping pace with technological developments, and the specific requirements of Olympic security, we will
increase the pace of the programme of savings achieved through joint working within the UK intelligence
community and reduce effort in some areas deemed lower priority by the National Security Council and the
Joint Intelligence Committee.
Our intelligence capabilities will support the increased emphasis on identifying threats and opportunities early,
shaping developments and preventing threats from emerging. Operating flexibly, we will:

#### • [focus intelligence collection and assessment on providing strategic insight and understanding, to inform policy ]
and decision-making

#### • [provide early indications and warnings of the intentions of hostile or potentially hostile state and non-state ]
actors, and insights into their capabilities

#### • [work to identify the scope and scale of terrorist and weapons proliferation networks, which can inform efforts ]
to disrupt them, including work with allies to interdict illegal shipments

#### • [carry out investigations into terrorist activity, from early attempts to radicalise through to detailed attack ]
planning

#### • [maintain our ability to provide timely technical assessments of emerging weapons systems and technologies, to ]
inform defence planning and the defence equipment programme.

While the focus will be on prevention, the intelligence community will also maintain its ability to respond to more
developed threats. We will:

#### • [retain the ability to collect and assess strategic and tactical intelligence to inform immediate policy decisions ]
 • [provide intelligence support to military and police operations ]
 • [improve our intelligence support to crisis management, e.g. in hostage situations ]
 • [maintain integrated intelligence support to the diplomatic and military effort in Afghanistan and the ]
wider region.

Intelligence relationships with overseas partners, based on shared security interests, will continue to be mutually
beneficial. We will:

#### • [continue to develop our most significant bilateral intelligence relationship with the US, and the ‘Five Eyes’ ]
cooperation with the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand

#### • [further expand our relationships with other partners with whom we have shared security interests, through ]
joint operations and intelligence exchange, both in Europe and more widely

#### • [share all-source intelligence assessments, terrorism threat assessments and security advice with and through ]
multi-national organisations, including NATO and EU member states

#### • [work with newer intelligence partners to help them to develop their capacity and skills, to improve our ]
combined effort.


-----

increase the effectiveness of the response in the
event of a terrorist firearms attack in the UK. We
will train a greater number of police officers to
be able to respond to an attack, enhance training
for existing firearms officers, increase the number
of armed response vehicles and introduce
measures to improve joint working between
police, fire and ambulance services to deal with
the particular challenges of evacuating casualties
during a firearms incident;

#### • [put in place new measures to reduce the ]
vulnerability of the UK to terrorist use of
new kinds of unconventional materials. We
will do this through improved protection
and preparedness measures, including the
deployment of improved detection capabilities
and investment in medical counter-measures;

#### • [introduce a programme to preserve the ability ]
of the security, intelligence and law enforcement
agencies to obtain communication data and
to intercept communications within the
appropriate legal framework. This programme
is required to keep up with changing technology
and to maintain capabilities that are vital to the
work these agencies do to protect the public.
Communications data provides evidence in
court to secure convictions of those engaged in
activities that cause serious harm. It has played
a role in every major Security Service counter­
terrorism operation and in 95% of all serious
organised crime investigations. We will legislate
to put in place the necessary regulations and
safeguards to ensure that our response to this
technology challenge is compatible with the
Government’s approach to information storage
and civil liberties.

##### B. Instability and conflict overseas

4.B.1 Recent experience has shown that instability
and conflict overseas can pose risks to the UK,
including by creating environments in which
terrorists and organised crime groups can recruit
for, plan and direct their global operations.
Groups operating in countries like Somalia and
Yemen represent a direct and growing terrorist
threat to the UK; criminal gangs use West Africa


for smuggling goods into the UK; and conflicts
overseas disrupt our trade and energy supplies.
A lack of effective government, weak security
and poverty can all cause instability and will be
exacerbated in the future by competition for
resources, growing populations and climate change.

4.B.2 A key principle of our adaptable approach
(set out in Part One) is to tackle threats at source.
We must focus on those fragile and conflictaffected countries where the risks are high, our
interests are most at stake and where we know we
can have an impact. To help bring enduring stability
to such countries, we will increase significantly
our support to conflict prevention and poverty
reduction. We will deliver this support through
an integrated approach that brings together our
diplomatic, development, defence and intelligence
resources. Specifically, we will:

#### • [provide clearer direction with a greater ]
focus on results through the new Building
Stability Overseas Strategy to be published in
spring 2011;

#### • [enhance the UK’s system of early warning for ]
countries at risk of instability to ensure that our
response is timely, appropriate and informed by
the UK national interest;

#### • [increase Official Development Assistance ]
(ODA) to 0.7% of Gross National Income (GNI)
by 2013. The main objective of ODA is, and
will continue to be, the economic development
and welfare of developing countries, with all UK
ODA remaining fully consistent with OECD
rules. By using 30% of ODA to support fragile
and conflict-affected states and tackle the
drivers of instability we will help some of the
poorest countries in the world address the root
causes of their problems, build more responsible
and accountable governments and strengthen
security and justice overseas;

#### • [direct more non-operational defence engagement ]
overseas towards conflict prevention, security
sector reform and capability building in priority
countries, including through: establishing new
training teams; running joint exercises; attaching
senior civilian policy advisers to foreign defence


-----

ministries, and increasing our arms control
engagement so as to promote regional stabilisation
and reduce the risk of conflict;

#### • [create a larger Conflict Pool by increasing ]
funding from £229 million in 2010/11 to around
£300 million by 2014/15. This will enable us to


plan our conflict prevention work several years
ahead, and to deliver more cross-government
support to long-term conflict prevention
and stabilisation programmes, for example in
security sector reform, justice and institution
building;


Supporting fragile states
The needs of fragile and conflict-affected states are among the greatest. None has met a single
Millennium Development Goal. They also present significant challenges to delivering aid effectively.
Instability, weak government and poor security all impede a country’s development.

We have learned important lessons about what works best in these environments: we must
address the root causes of conflict and fragility; support an inclusive political system which builds
a closer society; and strengthen the Government’s ability to deliver security, justice and economic
opportunity. That requires marshalling our development programmes, alongside our diplomatic
effort and defence engagement. And we know that we must be prepared to innovate.

We are putting this into practice in Afghanistan. The UK-led Provincial Reconstruction Team in
Helmand Province brings together all relevant UK departments, including DFID, FCO and MOD,
in support of the Afghan Government. After 30 years of war, local government had effectively
collapsed so Helmandis had no access to clean water, basic healthcare, education or justice.
Building on the improved security provided by international and, increasingly, Afghan forces the
Provincial Reconstruction Team has helped: rebuild schools, roads, water and electricity supplies;
support new district governors in 11 of Helmand’s 14 districts; and establish four elected
community councils.

Early interventions can reduce the likelihood of prolonged instability and suffering and prevent the
need for a more expensive solution. In 2001, the Ohrid Framework Agreement brought to an end
the armed conflict between the ethnic Albanian National Liberation Army (NLA) and Macedonian
security forces. NATO then deployed a short, 30-day mission to help embed the peace by
monitoring the disarmament of the NLA and destroying their weapons. It has been estimated
that early intervention by the international community cost £0.3 billion but saved an estimated
£14.7 billion had the conflict escalated.

Similarly, in 2007, Kenya’s election triggered widespread violence for two months. The UK led
international support for the peace process which sought to address this. The Conflict Pool provided
rapid funding for Kofi Annan’s successful mediation and for essential electoral reforms. At the same
time DFID, FCO and MOD implemented a jointly planned programme of support. This recently
culminated in a peaceful referendum on constitutional change with the potential to deliver much
improved governance.


-----

#### • [expand the remit of the joint Stabilisation ]
Unit so that it can draw on our 1,000-strong
pool of civilian experts from across the public,
private and voluntary sectors to help prevent
conflict and instability as well as support the
UK’s response to crises when they occur. As
part of this, we will examine how best the
Stabilisation Unit can be positioned to support
NSC priorities;

#### • [bring military and civilian expertise together in ]
new Stabilisation Response Teams. These joint
teams, with expertise tailored to the operational
environment, will be brought together when
needed to deploy at short notice anywhere in
the world where an integrated UK response
is needed. The teams will further expand
Stabilisation Unit capability to work in both
conflict prevention and crisis response. So
from April 2011, the Government will have
an enhanced capability to support a range of
activities: from assessing an emergent crisis, to
building government capacity through to postfli bili i



#### • [ensure that the Armed Forces’ advisory, ]
operational, influencing and training capabilities
are better coordinated in support of the overall
integrated approach and Stabilisation Response
Teams in particular;

#### • [share facilities in priority locations, with ]
Ambassadors and High Commissioners leading
in-country coordination, to maximise our
overseas presence and enhance joint working.
For example, in Afghanistan, representatives
of the FCO, DFID, MOD and Home Office are
already co-located and work to common goals
driven by the National Security Council;

#### • [accelerate our response time by cutting ]
bureaucracy. Instead of three separate
structures dealing with conflict, peacekeeping
and stabilisation, we will establish a single,
cross-government board to deal with conflict
overseas. This will help shape the overall
approach to conflict issues, while giving lead
responsibility for delivering results to our posts
overseas. By giving posts greater control over


-----

their resources they will have more flexibility to
respond quickly to unfolding events.

##### C. Cyber security

4.C.1 The risks emanating from cyber space
(including the internet, wider telecommunications
networks and computer systems) are one of the
four Tier One risks to national security (set out
in the National Security Strategy). These risks
include hostile attacks upon the UK from other
states, potential shortcomings in the UK’s cyber
infrastructure, and the actions of cyber terrorists
and criminals (see box below). But cyber space
also creates opportunities for the UK Government
and British businesses, which will derive benefits
from the protection that effective cyber security
measures bring to the UK economy. These threats
and opportunities are likely to increase significantly
over the next five to 10 years, as our dependence
on cyber space deepens.

4.C.2 The rapidly changing nature of these threats
and opportunities to the UK demonstrates the need
for a flexible cyber security response, in line with the
principles of our adaptable posture and the National
Security Tasks and Planning Guidelines. That response
must be led by government, but in doing so we must
leverage the knowledge and resources of the private
sector – including those parts of the private sector
that own and operate large elements of the critical
cyber infrastructure.

4.C.3 The Government will introduce a
transformative national cyber security programme
to close the gap between the requirements
of a modern digital economy and the rapidly
growing risks associated with cyber space. The
National Cyber Security Programme will be
supported by £650 million of new investment
over the next four years, working to one national
programme of activity with supporting strategies
in other departments. Successful delivery of this
transformative programme also depends on the
critical role that the private sector has to play;
our relationship with them must reflect a genuine
partnership where policy is co-designed so that
a credible national response can be delivered.
Through this programme, we will:

#### • [overhaul the UK’s approach to tackling cyber ]
crime We will create a single point of contact


where the public and businesses can report
cyber crime. We will also introduce a new
programme of skill development, to ensure that
those involved in combating cyber crime have
the knowledge required to identify, understand
and tackle the threat. And the Home Office will
publish a new National Cyber Crime Strategy
in late autumn 2010, drawing on expertise
across government;

#### • [address deficiencies in the UK’s ability to ]
detect and defend itself against cyber attack
– whether from terrorists, states, or other
hostile actors. This will include (i) improving our
ability to deliver cyber products and services;
and (ii) enhancing our investment in national
intelligence capabilities, focussing on the UK’s
centre for cyber security operations at GCHQ,
working in cooperation with other government
departments and agencies. These two elements
provide the foundation for all our activities in
cyber space, including safeguarding sensitive
government and military communications;

#### • [create a new organisation, the UK Defence ]
Cyber Operations Group, to mainstream cyber
security throughout the MOD and ensure the
coherent integration of cyber activities across
the spectrum of defence operations. This
will give MOD a significantly more focussed
approach to cyber, by ensuring the resilience
of our vital networks and by placing cyber at
the heart of defence operations, doctrine and
training. We will also work to develop, test
and validate the use of cyber capabilities as a
potentially more effective and affordable way of
achieving our national security objectives;

#### • [address shortcomings in the critical cyber ]
infrastructure upon which the UK as a whole
depends, both to tackle immediate weaknesses
in security and to ensure that we maintain access
to a trusted industrial base. This programme of
work will focus on ensuring that online public
services are secure, and that additional support
is given to key UK industries and those critical
networks owned and operated by private
companies (for example within the energy
sector). Partnership with industry will be key to
ensuring value for money. In addition, strategic
leadership and regulatory oversight will be


-----

provided by a new Cyber Infrastructure Team
within the Department for Business, Innovation
and Skills (BIS); �

#### • [sponsor long-term cyber security research, ]
working closely with the Research Councils, the
private sector and others to build and maintain
excellence in this area;

#### • [introduce a new programme of cyber security ]
education and skills in order to foster a more
preventative approach to cyber security
throughout the UK. Simple, common sense
security measures available to ordinary citizens
and businesses would make a major difference
if used widely. This programme will focus on
awareness-raising to help encourage safe and
secure online behaviour among the UK public
(for example, through increased investment in


Get Safe Online), as well as securing growth in
skills for the future; �

#### • [continue to build our cyber security alliances, ]
including through the already strong relationship
with the US and the establishment of new
relationships with like-minded nations. We
are working on a comprehensive UK-US
Memorandum of Understanding to enable us to
share information and plan and conduct operations
jointly in the cyber domain (see Part Five). We
will also undertake capacity building with partner
countries to ensure that, where we have key
national interests at stake, minimum standards of
cyber security are being met. We will continue to
engage constructively in international political and
technical fora to shape standards and norms in a
way that protects our vital interests in cyber space;


The threat from cyber crime
A third of the world’s population now uses the internet, which has become a pervasive aspect of
global commerce, communications and entertainment. But as global dependence on cyber space
continues to grow, so have the opportunities for criminals to take advantage of shortcomings in
cyber security.

While it is impossible to put a precise figure on the direct and indirect financial losses caused by
cyber criminals, we do know that the problem is growing progressively worse. For example, we
know that:

#### • [criminal groups have already registered over 9,500 Olympic Games-related web addresses ]
 • [there was a 14% increase in online banking losses between 2008 and 2009 ]
 • [51% of all the malicious software threats that have ever been identified were identified in 2009 ]
(see graph below showing the rise of this expanding form of cyber crime).

#### • [establish a programme management office within ]
the Office of Cyber Security and Information
Assurance (in the Cabinet Office) to oversee,
priortise and coordinate the centralised funding
and implementation of this transformative
National Cyber Security Programme;

#### • [bring together the specific changes highlighted ]
above in a new Cyber Security Strategy, to be
published in spring 2011.

##### D. Civil emergencies

4.D.1 Civil emergencies, including natural
disasters, major accidents and malicious acts, can
threaten serious damage to the welfare of British
citizens or the environment. Two of the risks of
greatest concern are terrorism and cyber crime
(discussed in more detail in the sections above).
But the highest risk category includes a severe
influenza pandemic and major coastal or tidal
flooding which, if they were to occur, would have
a significant impact on the UK, threatening the
lives of citizens and damaging the economy. Risks
related to all kinds of civil emergency are likely to
remain at similar levels to now over the next five
years, but the longer term prospects are that the
likelihood and impact of some natural hazards will
increase with changes in the climate.

4.D.2 The National Security Tasks and Planning
Guidelines set out a cross-government approach
to tackling civil emergencies, from horizon scanning
to the identification of emerging risks, crisis
management capabilities and the enhancement of
the local and national response to emergencies.
It also sets out a range of requirements that fall
principally to the private sector. In line with this
approach, we will be introducing a number of
changes. Specifically, we will:

#### • [change the relative focus of our civil ]
emergencies work, so that we are better
prepared for the highest priority risks to the
UK. The top three civil emergency risks are:
terrorist attacks using unconventional materials
(see section 4.A above); major tidal or coastal
flooding; and a severe influenza pandemic;

#### • [reinforce measures to improve preparedness ]
for these top three priority risks. We will
continue our extensive programme to improve


flood preparedness, including through an
enhanced water rescue capability and building
on the new National Flood Emergency
Framework published in July 2010. We will test
our preparedness through a major exercise
(‘Exercise Watermark’) in March 2011. In
relation to an influenza pandemic, we will review
plans over the next year, which will include new
measures identified as necessary following last
year’s H1N1 swine flu pandemic;

#### • [develop the work of the National Resilience ]
Capabilities programme to build generic
capabilities to deal with a wide range of high
likelihood and medium impact risks in the
National Risk Assessment, and continue to focus
attention within the programme on meeting
realistic targets for key priority capabilities;

#### • [focus on building community resilience to civil ]
emergencies, in recognition of the fact that
individuals, community and voluntary sector
groups and local businesses are better placed
than government to understand and respond
to the needs of the local community before,
during and after an emergency. This will be
part of the Government’s broader Big Society
agenda. It will see the introduction of a new
strategic national framework and a range
of public information products. These will
empower communities and local practitioners to
work more effectively together;

#### • [support small and medium-sized enterprises, ]
which may suffer disproportionately from civil
emergencies and have a potentially significant
contribution to make to the resilience of
communities and essential services, to improve
their business continuity by introducing a new
corporate resilience programme;

#### • [establish a new Infrastructure Security and ]
Resilience Advisory Council, which will
significantly enhance cooperation between
public sector bodies and private sector
providers of national infrastructure (for example
in the water, telecommunications, and civil
nuclear industries) and improve their resilience
to all kinds of hazard and threat, particularly with
regard to cyber attacks;


-----

#### • [enhance arrangements for response and crisis ]
management. We will strengthen the Crisis
Management Capability within the Cabinet
Office (see Part Six). We will also continue
to improve the capability and capacity of
local responders to handle emergencies,
including by clarifying their duties under the
Civil Contingencies Act, improving resilient
telecommunications and the ability of the
emergency services to work together during
emergencies. We will increase the information
available to help those who want to improve
their ability to respond to emergencies. We
will also develop arrangements for warning
and informing members of the public in an
emergency: for this we will evaluate options for


4.E.1 The UK faces a range of risks related to our
ability to access secure, diverse and affordable
supplies of energy, which are essential to economic
stability and growth. These include political
instability in key energy countries, insufficient
investment in states that supply energy, and
imperfections in the functioning of global and UK
markets. As the box below suggests, these risks are
likely to intensify over the coming years, due to our
growing dependence on imports of fossil fuels at
the same time that global demand and competition

##### E. Energy security


The UK’s increased reliance on imports of oil and gas


Falling UK production of oil and gas,
coupled with sustained demand, will
make us increasingly reliant on fossil fuel
imports. Without low carbon policies
(‘business as usual’ on the graph), net
oil and gas imports will rise rapidly.
Our low carbon policies can help us
reduce this demand and encourage
other countries to do the same, but
as the graph shows, we will still need
to import considerably more in the
future than we do at present. This is
why we need to deepen engagement
with energy producers, both bilaterally
and in multilateral forums, to encourage
investment in necessary transitional
oil and gas, enhance price stability,
promote low carbon growth and
improve the reliability of energy
supplies. The latter will involve ensuring
that business and political conditions
support key infrastructure projects,
including pipelines to bring gas from
the Caspian region to the EU, and
the North Sea Electricity Grid to
allow greater electricity trading with
northern European countries. Ensuring
our imports are from a diverse range
of sources can increase resilience by

4.E.2 The National Security Tasks and Planning
Guidelines provide for resilient supply and
distribution systems across all sectors of critical
national infrastructure, but because of the relative
importance of energy security, this section focuses
principally on the specific changes that we will
introduce in this area. In particular, we will:

#### • [give energy a higher priority in UK foreign ]
policy. We will reprioritise bilateral diplomatic
relationships, giving key supplier states a
stronger focus. We will strengthen our support
for UK companies working overseas to increase
the availability of energy supplies and to take
advantage of business opportunities. We will
also work with states and groupings of countries
that use the most energy – for example, US,
China, India, Russia and the EU – in support of
actions that reduce their oil and gas demand;

#### • [work with the EU, the International Energy ]
Agency and other international institutions to
take forward UK priorities, such as improving
energy infrastructure, promoting effective
energy market mechanisms, encouraging
energy efficiency and the deployment of low
carbon technologies. A particular priority
for progressing these objectives will be the
forthcoming EU Energy Strategy for Europe.
We will also work to enhance oil price stability
– which will improve affordability for UK
consumers – by influencing G20 activity and
agreeing a new International Energy Forum
Charter to strengthen the dialogue between
consumer and producer states;

#### • [work overseas, using diplomatic, military, ]
intelligence and economic activity to mitigate
disruption to the transit of energy supplies,
including by utilising the early warning capabilities
within the new National Maritime Information
Centre to monitor maritime supply lines and
critical national infrastructure (see section 4.G
below). We will take a risk-based approach to
the prioritisation of projects that support the
protection of partner countries’ infrastructure
and networks;

#### • [put in place measures to improve the ]
functioning of domestic energy markets. The
Office for Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem)
will be given new powers to enable them to


collect commercial plans over winter, when
energy demand peaks. We will also give Ofgem,
in the forthcoming Energy Bill, the power to
sharpen commercial incentives for energy supply
companies to meet their contractual supply
obligations in a gas supply emergency; remove
unnecessary obstacles to investment in nuclear
power, such as planning barriers, so that energy
companies can come forward to build new
nuclear power stations without public subsidy;

#### • [introduce measures to promote low carbon ]
energy and energy efficiency, including through
a new ‘Green Deal’ to reduce household
energy demand and the establishment of a
‘smart grid’ which will improve the interaction
between generators and consumers of
electricity to deliver more sustainable, diverse
and secure supplies;

#### • [establish stronger measures to ensure the ]
resilience of energy infrastructure. The
Home Office, MOD and the Department
for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) will
produce a policing strategy for critical national
infrastructure, which will explore the potential
benefits of aligning policing at these locations,
including civil nuclear sites. DECC will report
to the National Security Council on the
management of civil nuclear material stocks and
will provide both a comprehensive assessment
of the risks and threats to safety and security at
civil nuclear sites as well as proposals for future
actions the Government may take. The Nuclear
Decommissioning Authority will continue to
take forward the clean up and decommissioning
of the civil nuclear legacy sites;

#### • [reform Whitehall processes to ensure we act ]
efficiently and effectively to address energy
security concerns and ensure a stronger crossdepartmental approach (as set out in Part
Six). This will include the Secretary of State
for Energy and Climate Change taking lead
responsibility for energy security on the National
Security Council. He will be supported in this
task by the International Energy Committee,
jointly chaired by DECC and FCO;

#### • [strengthen the delivery of energy security ]
objectives by more robust reporting and
monitoring including by putting in place a


-----

transparent set of energy security indicators
in which the Government and its partners can
have confidence;

#### • [improve the Government’s ability to consider ]
and tackle the range of risks associated
with other resources, such as key mineral
components important for particular industries
(e.g. rare earth metals which are crucial for
some low carbon technologies), water and
food. These risks may arise as a result of
competiton for resources among or within
other countries, but nevertheless impact on the
UK’s national security. This will involve improving
the Government’s ability to understand and
respond to the national security impacts of
climate change, which may exacerbate existing
security threats. The FCO, reporting to the
National Security Council, will take responsibility
for coordinating work relating to these security
impacts of climate change and resource
competition (see Part Six).

##### F. Organised crime

4.F.1 Organised criminal activity poses a significant
and persistent threat to the UK public and
economy. At present, there are around 38,000
individuals involved in organised crime affecting
the UK, costing the economy and society between
£20 billion and £40 billion per annum. It is likely
that the threat from organised crime will increase
over the next five years, in particular as new
technologies make it easier for criminals to hide
or disguise their communications and exploit new
opportunities.

4.F.2 The National Security Tasks and Planning
Guidelines set out the high level crossdepartmental core requirements for addressing
organised crime, including through the provision
of law enforcement capabilities targeting the most
harmful organised criminal groups.

4.F.3 In order to fulfil these requirements, we
will need to change our overarching approach to
tackling organised crime. There will be a particular
need to ensure that the resource allocated to
tackling organised crime is used as efficiently and
effectively as possible. The changes that will help
to put in place this new approach, which will be
driven by the revised UK Threat Assessment are


forthcoming Organised Crime Strategy. Specifically,
we will:

#### • [establish a powerful new National Crime ]
Agency (NCA) which will lead the operational
fight against organised crime, addressing
one of the main problems with current
arrangements: the absence of a national tasking
and coordinating structure. The NCA will build
a more comprehensive picture of actionable
intelligence and provide effective national tasking
and coordination of police assets, and will ensure
more law enforcement activity takes place
against more organised criminals, at reduced
cost, by prioritising available resources in a
more efficient and effective manner. It will also
strengthen border policing arrangements (see
following section). Our ambition is for the NCA
to come fully into being in 2013, although some
key elements of its functions may be operational
before then. The Home Office has established
a programme which will work with partners to
develop proposals on the NCA’s jurisdiction,
scope and governance arrangements;

#### • [create a body with a specific function to fight ]
economic crime, to strengthen the response
to organised fraud against individuals and
businesses. This will help prevent fraud, by
tackling the criminal activity itself. It will also
allow us to maximise our ability to disrupt the
fraudsters, seizing or freezing their profits
and using all civil and criminal justice tools at
our disposal;

#### • [explore the potential synergies between our ]
organised crime and counter terrorism policing
business support and operational capabilities.
The aim will be to maximise the effectiveness
and efficiency of our overall effort and spend
against organised crime and terrorism, without
diluting the focus on either. The Home Office
will also undertake an analysis of the potential
overlap between organised crime and terrorism
in some key strategic areas including fragile
and failing states and with regard to money
laundering activities;

#### • [increase the effectiveness of our asset recovery ]
mechanisms, improving our ability to recover
assets held abroad, and resolve blockages in the
criminal justice system We will also explore


-----

which is a significantly more cost effective way of
depriving criminals of access to their finances;

#### • [introduce a new system for prioritising and ]
planning where we target organised crime
overseas, to ensure that when we do act,
we focus on those criminal groups which are
having the greatest impact on the UK. This
will be conducted through stronger strategic
prioritisation and coordination centrally. We will
ensure that our diplomatic posts coordinate
the overseas responses at a strategic level,
and we will maximise the efficiency and
effectiveness of our operational assets overseas,
by aligning and concentrating our existing
overseas liaison assets against commonly agreed
requirements. We will also better align overseas
organised crime-fighting capacity building with
development programmes on governance
and security.

##### G. Border security �

4.G.1 The UK’s border is the gateway for travel
and trade. Last year, more than 220 million people


and 450 million tonnes of freight passed through
our ports and airports. But individuals, groups
and states also move resources and people illicitly
for the purposes of criminal, terrorist and other
hostile acts. The projected increase in cross border
passenger journeys (up 70% by 2030), freight
volumes and the use of ever-more sophisticated
technologies by those with malicious intent is
likely to raise these risks in the future. That is
why border security is identified as an important
national security concern within the National
Security Risk Assessment and why we have a
comprehensive border protection framework
provided by the UK Border Agency, police and
other agencies.

4.G.2 To address these risks, the National Security
Tasks and Planning Guidelines set out the crossdepartmental requirements, including a specific
requirement for the border agencies to protect
the UK by strengthening border security. Many
other Tasks and Guidelines, in particular those
relating to organised crime and terrorism, are
also dependent on effective border security and
regulatory controls.


The e-Borders programme
e-Borders is a system which electronically collects and checks individual passenger details against
UK police, security and immigration watch lists. It is a key element of our strategy to deliver robust
border controls and it supports our national counter-terrorism strategy. It helps to reduce the
threat of terrorist attacks, to disrupt cross border crime and to prevent abuses of the immigration
system. e-Borders enables the UK Border Agency, police and other agencies to target and identify
in advance persons of interest entering or leaving the UK and plan interventions. It currently
analyses the details of over 123 million passengers travelling into and out of the UK every year
(see graph overleaf). The e-Borders system has provided the capability to undertake checks
electronically both earlier and against more comprehensive watchlists than was previously possible.
This has led to more than 7,200 arrests for crimes including murder, rape and assault. It has also
helped track individuals connected to counter-terrorist investigations; led to fake British passports
being impounded; the seizure of illegal drugs and illicit tobacco; the identification of smugglers and
people traffickers; and immigration offenders refused entry or deported.

The effectiveness of the programme is best shown in its application to specific cases. Last year a
British man was wanted by the police after fleeing to Thailand because, while employed as a tax
advisor, he had transferred over £1.8 million from the account of an elderly care home resident
over a five year period. He attempted to return to the UK in July and was identified by e-Borders.
The police were alerted and the man was arrested on his arrival, convicted and sentenced to
seven and a half years’ imprisonment. �


-----

4.G.3 In order to meet these Tasks and Guidelines,
we will make a number of changes to ensure that
our future activities are efficient and cost-effective.
That means introducing new technologies to
automate high volume processes; making structural
changes to reduce operating costs and reduce
duplication; and, where appropriate, making
use of the private sector. We will also focus our
efforts on where we can act most efficiently and
effectively to secure our borders – which might
mean taking action overseas, in our territorial
airspace or waters, at the UK’s physical border or
within the UK itself. Specifically, we will:

#### • [establish a Border Police Command within ]
the new National Crime Agency (see section
4.F), which will enable us to develop and
execute a single, coherent strategy for border
security. The Border Police Command will
also coordinate multi-agency tasking, which
will strengthen border policing arrangements,
improve immigration controls and help in the
response to organised crime;



#### • [prioritise activity overseas to tackle threats ]
before they reach us through capacity building
in law enforcement in high risk countries and
by closer working between those agencies
responsible for security and safety. This
means better aligning the work of a range
of organisations, including the UK Border
Agency, Serious Organised Crime Agency,
HM Revenue and Customs, Department for
Transport, Ministry of Defence and Foreign
and Commonwealth Office, on intelligence
and operational activities abroad and, where
appropriate, with foreign governments to ensure
a stronger and more interoperable approach to
border security;

#### • [strengthen our visa process by widening the ]
checks carried out on visa applicants and
their sponsors against information held by
government departments in the UK and in
other countries. We will also make changes to
pre-departure checks to identify better the
people who pose a terrorist threat and prevent
them flying to or from UK;



- Information used by e-Borders has been checked at the border for many years. e-Borders enables
this information to be checked against watchlists in advance of travel to help reduce the threat of
terrorism, crime and immigration abuse, and facilitate legitimate travel and trade.


-----

#### • [use technological improvements to address ]
border security risks better. We will modernise
our ability to use biometrics to protect our
borders by developing a faster, more accurate,
more resilient system; e-Borders is a key
element of our overarching strategy as it
enables us to target the most harmful individuals
(see box) and supports the development of our
biometric capability and our ability to undertake
effective exit checks as passengers leave the
UK. We are committed to enhancing e-Borders
capabilities to ensure that we can progress this
project in a timely and cost-effective way;

#### • [work for an EU Passenger Name Record ]
Directive to provide an unambiguous EU legal
framework for the collection of passenger data,
which will enable the UK to share passenger
data for journeys between EU member states
as well as travel to and from the EU from other
countries. Passenger Name Records, together
with Advance Passenger Information, provide
details of travellers as part of an early warning
system for the border agencies and police
before they travel;

#### • [create a multi-agency National Maritime ]
Information Centre (NMIC), which will –
for the first time – provide the UK with a
comprehensive picture of potential threats to
UK maritime security, in UK national waters. It
will then build links with international partners
to allow the UK to develop a global maritime
picture. Among other benefits, the NMIC will
provide the Government with a single picture of
maritime activity, bringing together intelligence
and monitoring carried out by the UK Border
Agency, Coastguard, Police, Royal Navy,
Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Marine
Management Organisation and other agencies. It
will be set up at a cost of £450,000;

#### • [adopt a stronger and more focussed cross-]
departmental approach to improving aviation
security. This will involve modernising the
regulatory regime and looking at ways in which
policing, passenger screening and border
controls might be better integrated, to drive up
security standards and improve the passenger
experience. To assist this, we will also fund work


under the INSTINCT programme to identify
and help develop innovative ways of managing
secure transit through airports. We will publish
proposals for consultation shortly on changes to
the regulatory regime. The threat to transport
security overall continues to evolve, and it is
essential that we work closely with industry to
continually improve the security systems needed
to respond to changes in the threats we face.

##### H. Counter proliferation and arms control

4.H.1 The National Security Risk Assessment
identifies the range of risks faced by the UK
from hostile acts by terrorists or states. There
are a number of capabilities – weapons of mass
destruction, emerging technologies with potential
military application, and the systems used to deploy
them – which could dramatically increase these
risks should they reach the wrong hands. Direct
threats to the UK include an attack by a terrorist
group, or a state, using chemical, biological,
radiological or nuclear (CBRN) weapons. Further
away from our shores, the proliferation of
these capabilities can create instability overseas
and increase regional tensions, with potentially
serious consequences for UK national security.
This problem is one that transcends national
boundaries and is likely to worsen with the spread
of technology over the coming years.

4.H.2 The National Security Tasks and Guidelines
in Part One set out our approach to addressing
these threats to UK national security, including
through the retention of critical capabilities at
the national level, and by proactively seeking
to strengthen multilateral initiatives to counter
proliferation and secure fissile material and
expertise from malicious use. To implement these
requirements, we will introduce a number of
changes to government policy. Specifically, we will:

#### • [strengthen central government direction over ]
our strategic counter proliferation priorities.
This will be supported by the establishment of a
new committee, chaired by the Cabinet Office,
reporting to the National Security Council.
The committee will ensure that UK counter
proliferation priorities are reflected in our wider
relationships with international partners;


-----

#### • [introduce a new common fund – the Critical ]
Capabilities Pool – that will be overseen by the
new committee and will bring together the crossgovernment activities that underpin our strategic
priorities. This will ensure that the UK retains the
skills and abilities it needs to tackle proliferation
risks at home and overseas, and improve the
transparency, accountability and efficiency with
which our resources are managed;

#### • [work to strengthen international commitments ]
to non-proliferation treaties such as the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Biological and
Toxin Weapons Convention and the Chemical
Weapons Convention. We will continue
to support the international bodies that
monitor and verify compliance against these
commitments, such as the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Organisation for
the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW);

#### • [refocus critical programmes for building security ]
capacity overseas (such as the G8 Global
Partnership-led Global Threat Reduction
Programme) on the areas that represent the
most serious risks to the UK: prioritising the
security of nuclear, biological and chemical
materials and expertise;

#### • [support international negotiations on an Arms ]
Trade Treaty to ensure that defence trade is
undertaken in a responsible manner, and to
ensure the UK meets its obligations in its own
export activity.

### Alliances and Partnerships


5.1 Alliances and partnerships will remain a
fundamental part of our approach to defence
and security. Internationally, we rarely act
alone. Maintaining and building constructive
and reciprocal bilateral relationships across all
aspects of national security can enhance capability
and maximise efficiency. And supporting the
development of major multilateral institutions and
instruments can underpin a more robust rulesbased international system and reflect the changing
balance of global power.

5.2 There are five priorities for our international
engagement that we have identified as essential
to our future security. They cut across each of the
policy areas outlined in the preceding chapters.
These are:

#### • [our pre-eminent defence and security ]
relationship with the US

#### • [new models of practical bilateral defence and ]
security cooperation with a range of allies
and partners

#### • [an effective and reformed United Nations ]
 • [NATO as the bedrock of our defence ]
 • [an outward-facing European Union that ]
promotes security and prosperity.

This section looks at our overall approach to
bilateral and multilateral partnerships but has a
strong emphasis on these five priorities.

##### Bilateral cooperation

5.3 We intend to intensify our bilateral defence
and security relationships with a range of key
partners and on a range of security issues


These will include countries who are close allies;
emerging economic powers; key regional states
with whom we might wish to act to address
common security interests; countries who supply
us with energy and other natural resources; and
states at risk of failure whose capacity we can help
to build. We will work with them to manage risks,
adapt to new challenges, and exploit opportunities.
This will include greater diplomatic cooperation,
for example coordination and co-location of
overseas missions, and shared development effort,
to combine specialist regional expertise and
increase joint funding of programmes.

5.4 We will focus particularly on building new
models of practical bilateral cooperation with
those countries whose defence and security
posture is closest to our own or with whom we
cooperate in multinational operations. Should we
need to conduct major operations overseas, it is
most likely that we will do so with others – Sierra
Leone in 2000 is the only significant operation
we have conducted alone since the Falklands
Conflict in 1982. If, in the context of multilateral
operations, we agree with other nations that we
will rely on them to provide particular capabilities
or conduct particular military roles or missions,
and they will likewise rely on us, then we will be
ready to underpin this understanding with legally
binding mutual guarantees.

5.5 We will also seek deepened relationships
with those with whom we can share capabilities,
technologies and programmes, ensuring that
collective resources can go further. We will
generally favour bilateral equipment collaboration
or off-the-shelf purchase, because such
arrangements are potentially more straightforward


-----

and more fruitful than complex multilateral
agreements, which have delivered mixed results
for us in the past. The criteria for equipment
cooperation will include the existence of common
requirements, complementary technological
capabilities, affordability for both participant
nations, and enhanced export potential or
industrial advantage.

5.6 We will reinforce our pre-eminent security
and defence relationship with the US. It remains
deeply-rooted, broadly-based, strategically
important and mutually supportive. The US
completed a Quadrennial Defence Review and
a first ever Homeland Security Review earlier
this year; we share its analysis of the security
context. As part of our on-going commitment to
working with our US colleagues at all levels, we
will strengthen our joint efforts in priority areas,
including counter-terrorism, cyber, resilience,
counter-proliferation, and partner capacity building
as well as on current operations. Specifically,
as elements of continuing comprehensive
engagement, we will:

#### • [enhance our strategic counter-terrorism ]
relationships, including by sharing access to key
capabilities to enable better border security,
transport security, further improving watch
list data sharing for aviation security; working
together in third countries to address the
shared threat and increasing the amount of joint
funding of science and technology programmes

#### • [enhance our cooperation on cyber security ]
through our existing close defence and
intelligence relationships. We are currently
developing a new comprehensive Cyber
Operations Memorandum of Understanding
which will develop, promote and support a
shared vision for cyber space and prioritise our
work together. It will specifically aim to allow
us better to share information, intelligence and
capabilities to enable joint planning and the
conduct of operations in the cyber domain

#### • [establish a senior level organised crime contact ]
group, to tackle the serious threat of organised
crime by sharing experiences and innovative
solutions, and identifying areas for cooperation
in regions and countries of mutual interest.
The first meeting will be hosted in London in


November 2010 and will be chaired jointly
by the Home Secretary and the US Deputy
National Security Advisor for Homeland
Security and Counter Terrorism

#### • [strengthen cooperation in our approaches ]
to the most serious resilience risks, including
through shared assessments and, where
appropriate, joint programmes

#### • [enhance the vital intelligence contribution to the ]
bilateral relationship

#### • [intensify our efforts to set the international ]
agenda on nuclear non-proliferation and
broader arms control, working together closely
both multilaterally and bilaterally. For example,
the UK has led support for President Obama’s
goal of a global lock-down of vulnerable nuclear
material, including by inviting an International
Atomic Energy Agency peer review of Sellafield
– the first nuclear weapons state to do so

#### • [work together on conflict prevention to secure ]
the maximum benefits from our joint efforts

#### • [maintain military capabilities that provide ]
maximum mutual benefit, for example
Special Forces

#### • [maintain our nuclear relationship based ]
on the 1958 Mutual Defence Agreement,
which enables close collaboration and
information exchange

#### • [continue our commitment to the Joint Strike ]
Fighter programme.

5.7 We will also intensify our security and
defence relationship with France. The UK and
France are active members of NATO, the EU
and the UN Security Council, are Nuclear
Weapon States, and have similar national security
interests. Our Armed Forces are of comparable
size and capability and it is clear that France will
remain one of the UK’s main strategic partners.
We already draw operational and financial
benefit from close cooperation between our
forces and defence communities and we will
strengthen the relationship at all levels, and where
possible, develop future military capabilities in
complementary, cost-efficient ways. We expect
the next UK/France Summit to develop ideas for
closer cooperation in a number of areas including:


-----

#### • [aligning elements of our armed forces in ]
order to provide high readiness joint formations
for future operations, including improved
interoperability, information sharing, and logistics
cooperation

#### • [developing joint military doctrine and training ]
programmes relating for example to non­
combatant evacuation operations, and responses
to counter-improvised explosive devices

#### • [extending bilateral cooperation on the ]
acquisition of equipment and technologies, for
example in the areas of complex weapons, and
increasing significantly our investment in joint
projects, including unmanned aerial systems

#### • [aligning wherever possible our logisitics ]
arrangements; including providing spares and
support to the new A400M transport aircraft

#### • [working together to develop a stronger, ]
globally competitive defence industrial and
technology base

#### • [enhancing joint working on emerging security ]
concerns such as cyber security, where we will
work together to understand and defend against
potential threats.

5.8 We will also look to increase bilateral
cooperation with a wide range of other countries.
Our shared interests are most intense with our
NATO and EU partners (including European allies
such as Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain
with whom we have a history of close equipment
or other defence cooperation). We are developing
deepened bilateral security partnerships with
Turkey, India, Japan, the Gulf Cooperation Council
states and others; we share crucial security
interests with Pakistan; and we are building up
our political and security dialogue with China,
with Russia, and with fast growing economies like
Brazil and Indonesia. And we will maintain our
long-standing intelligence partnership with the US,
Australia, Canada and New Zealand.

##### Multilateral engagement

5.9 The UK enjoys a central position in key
multilateral institutions such as the UN Security
Council and the international financial institutions,


and is a leading member of the European Union,
NATO, G8, G20, and the Commonwealth. We
make significant contributions to international
organisations like the Organisation for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and
implementation bodies such as the International
Atomic Energy Agency. We also support regional
organisations such as the African Union and the
Association of South East Asian Nations.

5.10 We will seek to enhance directly the
effectiveness of the multilateral institutions most
important to the UK’s national security interests,
and to use effectively our leading role within them.
The United Nations is key to the UK’s global
security and prosperity interests. Through the UN
Security Council, it has primary responsibility for
international peace and security. Over the next
five years, we have set ourselves six priority goals.
These are to:

#### • [push for an effective Security Council that is ]
more representative of the world as it is now

#### • [build a broader international consensus in ]
favour of UN budget discipline, better value for
money and a reduction in duplication; and seek
a more equitable allocation of UN costs among
member states

#### • [work with the UN Secretariat, regional ]
organisations and key member states, including
the emerging powers and troop and police
contributing countries (both current and
potential), to ensure that conflict prevention
plays a central role in UN efforts to foster global
peace and security, alongside more effective
peacekeeping and peace-building

#### • [promote reforms to ensure a United Nations ]
which better integrates political, security,
development, humanitarian and human
rights efforts, including through strengthened
UN leadership, so that it can deliver earlier
and better

#### • [use our influence to promote better UN ]
coordination with NATO and the EU, including
more strategic dialogue and cooperation on
planning of operations


-----

#### • [work with allies at the UN to ensure ]
that governance of cyber space develops
appropriately, strengthening bodies such as the
Internet Governance Foundation and ensuring
an appropriate role for the International
Telecoms Union.

5.11 The UK is a founding member of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO),
which has been the bedrock of our defence for
over 60 years. Our obligations to our NATO
Allies will continue to be among our highest
priorities and we will continue to contribute to
NATO’s operations and its Command and Force
Structures, to ensure that the Alliance is able to
deliver a robust and credible response to existing
and new security challenges. Key to NATO’s future
will be the agreement and implementation of
its new Strategic Concept which will set out its
enduring purpose, its fundamental security tasks
and guidance to Allies. It will be agreed by Allies
at the Lisbon summit in November and should
include a renewed commitment to NATO’s reform
agenda. We will work with Allies to:

#### • [ensure that NATO has the political will and ]
ability to respond to current and future threats
to its security wherever they arise, sharing the
risks and responsibilities equitably

#### • [successfully complete the mission of the NATO-]
led International Security Assistance Force in
Afghanistan to help build the authority and
influence of the Government of Afghanistan
and pave the way for reconstruction and
effective governance

#### • [continue to support the generation of those ]
skills and capabilities which allow the Allies
to work together on operations, including,
as appropriate, with non-NATO partners

#### • [recognise the importance of NATO’s wider ]
security role in responding to new types
of threat such as those from cyber attack,
including by supporting a renewed emphasis
on consultation under Article IV of the
Washington Treaty

#### • [continue to reform NATO, including by ]
improving how its headquarters work,
rationalising NATO Agencies, and by developing


command and force structures that can better
deliver a robust and credible response to
current and emerging security challenges

#### • [build more efficient and effective partnerships ]
between NATO, other organisations and
states in order to combine civilian and military
capabilities more effectively to improve the
response to security threats

#### • [in particular, foster better EU-NATO ]
cooperation and ensure that both organisations
can call on scarce national military planning
and civilian resources; sharing expertise and
developing complementary, rather than
duplicate, skills and capabilities.

5.12 UK membership of the European Union is
a key part of our international engagement and
means of promoting security and prosperity in the
European neighbourhood. The common security
interests of the member states are served when
they use their collective weight in the world to
promote their shared interests and values including
on major foreign policy security concerns. The EU’s
ability to integrate civilian and military responses
coherently will become increasingly important.
We will:

#### • [support continued EU enlargement as a ]
proven means of promoting stability across
the continent: the EU should honour its
commitment to Turkey and the countries of the
Balkans so that they can join when they meet
the agreed criteria

#### • [work to ensure the EU External Action ]
Service places a particular emphasis on conflict
prevention and developing partnerships with the
UN and NATO

#### • [support EU missions – whether military or ]
civilian – which are in the UK’s national interest,

### Structural Reform and Implementation


6.1 In order to ensure efficient and effective
delivery of our strategic defence and security
priorities, we will establish leaner, better
coordinated structures and processes. We
have already established at the heart of the
Government the National Security Council,
supported by the new National Security Adviser
and National Security Secretariat. This enables
prompt, coherent and coordinated decision making
on all aspects of our national security.

6.2 The National Security Council has used
this Strategic Defence and Security Review to
rebalance expenditure within the overall national
security funding envelope, and it will continue to
do so in future years including, where necessary,
in years between Spending Reviews.

##### Delivery in the UK

6.3 Better coordination in the UK will help us
to address threats to the public, institutions and
infrastructure, including by establishing:

#### • [an integrated ][‘all risks approach’][ to the ]
consequence management of civil emergencies
under the coordination of the Cabinet Office
which will ensure that measures to reduce the
vulnerability of people and critical assets, and
responses to any kind of civil emergency, are
fully coordinated

#### • [a strengthened ][Crisis Management Capability ]
within the Cabinet Office. This will bring
together civil servants and police in the
Cabinet Office with new permanently based
Defence specialists. This strengthened Crisis
Management Capability will significantly enhance
the Government’s ability to prepare plan and


manage its response to domestic security crises,
both centrally and locally

#### • [a ][National Crime Agency][ to lead the fight ]
against organised crime and protect our borders
by harnessing and building on the intelligence,
analytical and enforcement capabilities of the
existing Serious Organised Crime Agency and
the Child Exploitation and Online Protection
Centre, and better connecting these capabilities
within the police service, HM Revenue and
Customs and the UK Border Agency

#### • [a ][Border Police Command ][supported by a ]
National Border Security Group to enhance our
capability to tackle threats at the border, coupled
with a new multi-agency National Maritime
Information Centre to provide, for the first time,
a complete picture of maritime threats

#### • [a ][strengthened Office of Cyber Security ]
equipped to deliver our transformative National
Cyber Security Programme

#### • [a ][National Space Security Policy][ which will ]
coherently address all aspects, both military
and civil, of the UK’s dependence on space;
assure access to space; help mitigate risks to
critical national infrastructure; focus future
investment and research on national priorities,
opportunities, and sovereign capability
requirements; and encourage co-operation
with UK industry and with international
partners. Examples of these risks include the
potential effects of interference, cyber attack,
physical damage, and electromagnetic pulse
(whether natural or deliberate) on satellites or
their ground stations critical to our security and
the economy


-----

#### • [an extention to the remit of existing climate ]
change governance structures to include
management of the national security risks posed
by the global impact of climate change and
global competition for resources.

##### Delivery overseas

6.4 We will better coordinate our activity overseas
to ensure that it is consistent and aligns fully
diplomatic, development, economic, defence
and intelligence engagement, underpinned
by appropriate resourcing. We will put more
emphasis on identifying and addressing potential
risks before they manifest themselves on our
shores or develop into wider threats to our
security, and take an integrated approach to
building stability overseas, as set out in section 4.B.
We will also improve coordination and focus by:

#### • [producing ][integrated strategies][ through a ]
Foreign and Commonwealth Office-led process
for key countries and regions. The highest
priority strategies will be agreed by the National
Security Council in order to ensure that they
are supported by all relevant government
departments, reflect agreed priorities, and are
appropriately resourced

#### • [prioritising our ][economic interests][. The FCO, ]
Department for Business Innovation and Skills
(BIS) and UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) will
drive this agenda with government departments
at home and abroad to support commercial
activity and embed a more commercial culture
throughout our overseas posts. The UKTI-FCO
Joint Commercial Task Force will work with
industry to identify top commercial priorities,
integrate these into country and regional
strategies, and use our overseas network
to help realise our national economic and
industrial objectives

#### • [working with the MOD and Home Office, ]
specifically to promote defence and security
exports for good commercial reasons and
where this will build the capacity of our partners
and allies, increase interoperability, potentially
reduce our own defence acquisition costs, and
maximise UK industry’s comparative advantage
in key technologies, skills and know-how, in
accordance with export controls and without


risking the proliferation of sensitive technologies
critical to the UK’s military edge

#### • [focussing, within our overall approach to ]
defence engagement, on supporting current
operations and standing commitments, including
by prioritising key allies, countries that provide us
with access, basing and over-flight privileges; and
on where defence activity can add most value,
for example in countries where the military
plays a prominent role in national policy-making.

##### Central coordination and strategy

6.5 Strategic all-source assessment, horizonscanning and early warning are integral parts of
the work of several government departments
and should feed directly into policy-making, into
the annual domestic National Risk Assessment
and into the biennial strategic National Security
Risk Assessment review process. We need to
ensure that the National Security Council has
timely, relevant and independent insight to inform
its decisions, and that assessment capabilities are
coordinated to support cross-cutting strategic
policy work. In order to achieve this:

#### • [priorities][ will be agreed annually by the National ]
Security Council

#### • [these priorities will be used to produce ]
specific requirements for strategic all-source
assessment, taking into account assessment
capacity and expected volumes of information
to be collected. Oversight arrangements will be
established to drive performance against these
requirements; to deliver improved coordination
of prioritisation and allocation of resources
across the full range of all-source assessment
bodies and functions; and to realise efficiency
savings. Cross-departmental cooperation will
be further strengthened by closer collaborative
working and a common framework for
analytical skills and training to promote analytical
career development

#### • [the assessment function will remain ][independent ]
from policy making and the Joint Intelligence
Committee (JIC) will continue to have a senior,
full-time, Chair, independent of both the
intelligence agencies and policy customers


-----

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the UK’s overseas network
As part of an adaptable posture, the UK will continue to need an active foreign policy and strong
representation abroad. A genuine understanding of what is happening overseas requires people
on the ground. And effective influencing – of governments, countries and organisations – requires
face to face contact.

The National Security Council therefore agreed to maintain a global diplomatic network but
with a sharper focus on promoting our national security and prosperity. The aim is to protect UK
interests, addressing risks before they become threats, meeting new challenges as they emerge,
and embracing new opportunities, while doing better with less. We also recognise that we cannot
achieve long-term security and prosperity unless we uphold and promote our values in our
international relationships. To achieve this, the FCO will:

#### • [operate according to a ][new, more focussed, mandate: ][to safeguard the UK’s national security, ]
build its prosperity, and support UK nationals around the world

#### • [maximise the economic opportunities provided by the network with a ][new emphasis on ]
commercial diplomacy including more effort on creating exports and investment; opening
markets; ensuring access to resources and promoting sustainable global growth �

#### • [improve ][coordination of all UK work overseas][ under the leadership of the Ambassador ]
or High Commissioner representing the UK Government as a whole, and create a simpler
mechanism to allow other government departments to co-locate with the FCO overseas to
increase efficiency �

#### • [focus resources][ on those countries most important to our security and prosperity including by ]
establishing stronger bilateral relationships with a range of key partners such as India and China
and on supporting fragile states such as Afghanistan, Somalia and Yemen

#### • [continue to provide global coverage in a cost effective way by increasing efficiency and ]
developing new, more flexible forms of diplomacy including regional coverage from central
hubs, deploying mobile consuls across borders to reinforce our missions during serious consular
incidents or in response to seasonal tourist patterns, rapid deployment teams for reaching crises
quickly, and extending use of digital media to reach and influence more audiences

#### • [continue to support the ][BBC World Service][ and ][British Council][ which play unique roles in ]
promoting our values, culture and commitment to human rights and democracy. �



#### • [existing centres of excellence within ]
departments will be developed further to meet
the needs of the broader national security
community in a cost effective and sustainable
manner, starting with a virtual hub for counterproliferation technical assessment based in
the MOD, which will join up proliferation
expertise from across the community and
wider government

#### • [an annual mandate for cross-Whitehall ][horizon ]
scanning, based on the National Security
Council-agreed priorities, will ensure focus on


key areas of concern while allowing scope for
consideration of new, emerging issues. The
Cabinet Office horizon scanning staff, working
in the strategy team of the National Security
Secretariat, will be responsible for coordinating
this work and producing reports for the
National Security Council

#### • [early warning][ will continue to be a key role of ]
the Cabinet Office and departments, using allsource analysis to advise the National Security
Council of emerging issues with implications for
UK interests, including through a biannual report
specifically on Countries at Risk of Instability, and


-----

reports from the Joint Intelligence Organisation
on other issues. The National Security Council
will consider those issues of greatest concern to
UK interests and prioritise policy responses.

The National Security Council will consider the
highest priority issues raised through these areas of
work. The value of the reports produced will be
reflected in feedback and in the setting of priorities
for subsequent years.

6.6 We will also strengthen central direction of
strategy and communications:

#### • [A number of departments have ][Strategy Units ]
which support the development of forwardlooking defence and security policy, including by
engaging with thinkers outside government. We
will coordinate their work programmes better
and improve collaboration through the creation
of a more formal strategic thinking network
overseen by the National Security Adviser

#### • [Strategic Communications ][are important for ]
our national security because they can positively
change behaviours and attitudes to the benefit
of the UK, and counteract the influence of
dangerous individuals, groups and states. We will
produce a National Security Communications
Strategy which will, for the first time, set out
how the UK will use strategic communications
to deliver national security objectives. The
National Security Council will further consider
the infrastructure and governance arrangements
required for marshalling and aligning the full
range of communciations resources across and
beyond government.

6.7 The National Security Council will provide
focus and overall strategic direction to the
science and technology capability contributing to
national security, so that decisions by individual
departments and agencies take account of the
needs of Government as a whole and make best


use of available resources. This capability will
support horizon scanning and risk assessment;
underpin work on crisis prevention and response;
and maintain our technological edge and flexibility.
It will also enable us to engage successfully with key
strategic partners on science and technology issues.

##### Implementation

6.8 Lead ministers, accountable to the National
Security Council, will take responsibility for
coordinating priority areas of work to deliver
the national security tasks. They will work with
all departments with a stake in the issue. Lead
ministers will be supported by officials who will
lead work across government and in partnership
with others including the private sector, non­
governmental organisations (NGOs) and
international partners, including by:

#### • [co-located teams: ][suited to priority areas of ]
work needing joined-up expertise to produce
strategy and guide implementation, such as
counter-terrorism where experts in foreign
policy, defence, border security, intelligence and
policing are co-located to form the Office for
Security and Counter-Terrorism

#### • [small coordination teams: ][for example our ]
approach to resilience to civil emergencies
where a Civil Contingencies Secretariat, which is
part of the National Security Secretariat in the
Cabinet Office, coordinates a strategy for all UK
bodies which need to be involved in managing all
kinds of civil emergency; and the virtual hub for
counter-proliferation technical assessment.

Details of lead ministers, designated officials, and
bodies responsible for coordinating work on
priority areas across all relevant departments are
as follows:


-----

6.9 It will be important to drive and monitor
the implementation by lead ministers, officials
and departments of Review outcomes, by the
following means:

#### • [the implementation process will, where possible, ]
draw on existing programme management
functions; this will maximise their effectiveness,
efficiency and visibility

#### • [implementation will be driven from the centre ]
by a cross-departmental Implementation Board
chaired by the Cabinet Office and attended
by lead officials to monitor progress, risks and
issues and to identify areas of concern

#### • [six-monthly updates for the Prime Minister ]
and National Security Council

#### • [an annual public statement on overall progress ]
 • [regular forums with NGOs, civil society and the ]
private sector led by departments



#### • [as part of the implementation phase, the ]
Government will conduct full impact appraisals
to determine effects of all decisions in the
Strategic Defence and Security Review on safety,
the environment, sustainable development and
equality and diversity.

6.10 Through the creation of the National Security
Council, we have established a means of ensuring
prompt, coherent, coordinated and informed
decision-making on all strategic defence and
security issues. To ensure these National Security
Council decisions are implemented as well as
they possibly can be, we have created integrated
structures, at home and overseas, coordinated
by lead ministers. But it will take time to instil
a genuinely integrated approach. This Review
marks the beginning, not the end, of a new way
of working.


-----

6.11 We will ensure that our approach to national
security remains relevant and effective. The
National Security Council will continue to meet
and take decisions every week, informed by up
to date intelligence and assessment of risks and
threats. Once every parliament, it will fully refresh

National Security Council structure


this defence and security review, to ensure that
the fundamental judgements remain right, that
the changes it sets out are affordable and that
it provides the right basis on which to deliver
security for the UK, its interests and people.
