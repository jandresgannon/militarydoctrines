he Ministry of National Defense is obligated to periodically report “what it
has done, what it is doing, what it prepares to do, why it is going to do so” to
### T
the people in accordance with Article 30 of the National Defense Act. The National
Defense Report is published to give citizens a better understanding of the nation’s
current security environment and national defense policy. Furthermore, the National
Defense Report allows citizens to understand that the ROC Armed Forces is unbiased
and must abide by the ROC Constitution, firmly maintain administrative neutrality,
support government administration, and ensure national security.

As this year marks as the 100[th] anniversary of the Republic of China, this National
Defense Report possesses the epochal significance of “inheriting from the past” and
“carrying on for the future,” and thus uses “A New Epoch of National Defense” as
its axis. This year’s National Defense Report conducts a comprehensive review of
implementation results of national defense policy in recent years, and outlooks on
future force development directions, so that citizens will understand, recognize and
support national defense affairs. In addition, this Report commends the heroic deeds
of the Black Cat and Black Bat Air squadrons, the martyrs in Battle of Kuningtou and
Battle of Yijiangshan, as well as the selfless devotion of the Army 1[st ]Special Forces,
which have succeeded the Armed Forces honorable history.

Ever since President Ma Ying-jeou assumed office in May 2008, the government
has endeavored to implement a pragmatic Mainland policy with foresight, and thus
improved the situation in the Taiwan Strait, significantly reducing the possibility
of an armed conflict. However, peace must be established on strong self-defense
capabilities, and not rely on the aid or good intentions of others. We have observed
that the PRC continues to insist that articles on taking non-peaceful means for
resolving the cross-Strait issue are required in the “Anti-secession Law”; the PRC
has showed no signs of adjusting its military deployment opposite Taiwan. As the last
line of defense of national security, the ROC Armed Forces must build a “Hard ROC”
defense force to preserve peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, so as to ensure that
citizens may live in peace and enjoy their work.

In addition to force development and defense preparedness for possible enemy threat,
the Ministry of National Defense attaches great importance to unconventional security
issues, because the threat of terrorism, complex disasters (earthquake, tsunami,
typhoon, nuclear disaster...) and pandemics to people’s lives and properties is no less

than war. Among government agencies, the military has the greatest mobilization
capability and most rapid mobility. Thus, it is the most efficient. Therefore, the
ROC Armed Forces has listed “disaster prevention and relief” as one of its main
missions, engaging in disaster relief based on the principle of “preparing for disasters
in advance, deploying troops with an eye to disaster preparedness, and ensuring
readiness for rescue operations.” In the future, the Armed Forces will continue
to actively strengthen its overall disaster relief capabilities, so that it will become
a powerful force capable of “disaster relief during peacetime and combat during
wartime,” shouldering the responsibility of protecting people’s lives, properties and
safety.

With regard to recent espionage and breach of military discipline, the Ministry
of National Defense bravely faces its faults and emphasizes the importance of
servicemen’s military ethics as well as patriotism and loyalty. In the aftermath of
the incident, the Ministry of National Defense thoroughly reviewed its system
and practices, so as to maintain military discipline. Additionally, in the “Lafayette
corruption case,” which has been closely followed by the public and concerns national
interests and the Armed Forces’ honor, the Ministry of National Defense followed
the President’s guidance of “administration according to law, implementation of
arbitration,” and the “arbitration court of the International Chamber of Commerce
(ICC)” ruled in our favor on May 31[st], 2010. This case shows the wisdom and
integrity of our military predecessors, virtues that our generation should learn from;
the victory in court greatly encourages citizens, and sets a good example for the
Armed Forces.

The “2011 National Defense Report” not only explains implementation results
of national defense policy, but also describes the ROC Armed Forces’ active
implementation of voluntarism, determination to establish self-defense capabilities
and efforts to enhance disaster relief preparedness, hoping to gain the people’s trust
so that they will identify and support national defense policy, thereby successfully

achieve national defense transformation.

Introduction


n recent years, cross-Strait relations have
gradually relaxed as a result of the government’s
###### I
endeavors. Contact and exchanges between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait have greatly reduced
the possibility of armed conflict. We believe this
is a development that countries in the Asia-Pacific
area and all citizens are pleased to see. Although
cross-Strait relations are no longer as tense as in
the past, facing the PRC’s military development,
the ROC Armed Forces will not and cannot rely on
the PRC’s good intentions for peace; strengthening
defense capabilities is the fundamental way to
ensuring peace in the Taiwan Strait. This year’s
national defense report describes how the ROC
Armed Forces has actively responded to changes
in the strategic environment, and is building a
“small but superb, small but strong and small
but smart” defense force via innovations in
organizational system, force structure, project
workflow, talent cultivation, resource allocation
and capabilities development.

he ROC Armed Forces serves as a defender of national security and the people’s
welfare, and a guardian of constitutional democracy. It resolutely holds the belief to
##### T
“fight for the survival and development of the ROC, and fight for the safety and welfare
of people in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matzu.” It clearly understands that “there is
a clear and definite line between the ROC Armed Forces and PLA,” and takes suitable
actions to ensure national security. The significant growth of the PRC’s comprehensive
national strength has become an unavoidable issue that the ROC must face and respond
to. Even today the PRC has not renounced the use of military force against Taiwan,
and over one thousand missiles are still deployed along the coast opposite Taiwan.
Furthermore, the PRC has resorted to every conceivable means to collect intelligence
on the ROC Armed Forces, and as cross-strait exchanges are becoming more and more
frequent, Taiwan must confront the threat of the PRC.

“Peace must be backed by strength.” Therefore, the Ministry of National Defense has not
for a single moment relaxed its endeavors in force buildup and defense readiness. Force
buildup continues to be guided by the military strategic concept of “resolute defense and
credible deterrence,” emphasizing the enhancement of the ROC Armed Forces’ joint
operation capabilities, and aiming to achieve war prevention and deterrence. Defense
readiness is based on the principles of “smart and steadfast, and strict and arduous”;
important exercises and training missions, such as the Han Kuang Exercise, are utilized
to pragmatically review the Armed Forces’ training results, thereby enhancing the Armed
Forces’ overall capabilities.

In addition to its duty to ensure peace in the Taiwan Strait, the ROC Armed Forces is
also actively strengthening its disaster prevention and relief capabilities. It has become
a global consensus that unconventional security issues are a threat to people’s lives and
properties no less than conventional security issues, such as military conflicts. Among
unconventional security issues, severe climate change is the most threatening to people’s
survival and safety. Facing growingly frequent extreme weather disasters, countries
around the world must even more sternly face the loss of lives and properties caused by
natural disasters.

Facing the current strategic environment and security situation, the ROC Armed Forces
is actively engaged in force buildup, hoping to become a powerful force that can “carry
out disaster relief during peacetime and engage in combat during wartime.” This book
uses “A New Epoch of National Defense” as its axis, and consists of four parts – “Strategic
Environment,” “National Defense Transformation,” “National Defense Capabilities” and
“Bringing Peace and Stability to the Country,” with a total of nine chapters. Each part is
summarized below:

中華民國壹百年

國防報告書

Part 1 Strategic Environment

This part summarizes developments of the global strategic environment, as well as
possible trends of future security situations. Then, it analyzes the threat of the PRC’s
military development, and describes how the ROC responds to changes in the current
strategic environment.

Part 2 National Defense Transformation

This part uses current defense policy and defense strategic objectives to explain the two
focuses of “national defense transformation” – implementation status of “voluntarism”
and organizational restructuring plans of the “Jingtsui Program.”

Part 3 National Defense Capabilities

This part explains results of the ROC Armed Forces’ efforts to enhance “intangible
combat capabilities,” “joint operations effectiveness,” “information and electronic warfare
capabilities” and “logistic support” in recent years, and how “human,” “financial” and
“material” resources are utilized. Furthermore, this part also describes the promotion of
all-out defense concepts and how all citizens and national resources are an integral part of
national defense capabilities.

Part 4 Bringing Peace and Stability to the Country

This part elaborates on the ROC Armed Forces’ efforts in disaster prevention and relief in
terms of laws, equipment and training, and also describes missions executed in the past
two years and how the Armed Forces will further strengthen its capabilities to safeguard
people’s lives and properties. Furthermore, this part describes services provided by the
ROC Armed Forces to citizens, servicemen and their dependents, so that the Armed
Forces gains support from the people and builds up esprit de corps.

The ROC Armed Forces safeguards the survival and development of the ROC, and is
an elite force that has “restored Taiwan,” “defended Taiwan,” “constructed Taiwan” and
“safeguarded Taiwan.” The “2011 National Defense Report” not only expounds the global
security situation and analyzes the threat of the PRC’s military development to Taiwan,
but also reveals pragmatic, new concepts of force buildup of the ROC Armed Forces, and
explains current defense policy and development visions, hoping to help citizens gain a
clear understanding that will build the consensus that military and civilian are one. This
will support the ROC Armed Forces in building a “Hard ROC” defense force that will
make the enemy not dare to, become unwilling to and unable to invade Taiwan, thus
protecting the country and contributing to regional peace and stability at the same time.

Strategic Environment

evelopments of the international situation are


affected by the interactive effects of conventional
#### D
and unconventional security issues. The complex
environment of the Asia-Pacific region, as a result of
military conflicts, economic cooperation and natural
disasters, has become an epitome of the international
situation. The ROC is located at the hinge of East Asia;
its geographic location gives it strategic importance,
but also the challenge of diverse natural disasters,
a threat to our national security besides regional
conflicts. Furthermore, from a political aspect, we
must face the security challenge of the rise of the PRC,
the rapid modernization of its military, as well as the
threat of severe changes in the natural environment
to people’s lives and properties. Therefore, the
ROC Armed Forces must continue to carry out its
operational duties, implement military transformation,
and fully understand crises and opportunities created
by the current strategic environment, so that it will be
able to response to internal and external challenges and
ensure national security.

regions, nor is it confined to conventional armed
conflicts, and may include extreme climate, energy
competition, terrorist attacks, new infectious
diseases, and hacking of critical information
systems. These have all become issues that cannot be
overlooked by countries when considering threats to
national security. The effect of these issues becomes
increasingly apparent following growing interactions
between nations and regions, and bears direct impact
on the process and nature of national policy, people’s
way of life, and interactions between nations.

Section 1 Global Security Situation

The U.S. still exerts the influence of its national strength to maintain current global
and economic order. However, the influences of the E.U., Russia, PRC, India and
Japan on their respective regions are gradually growing, especially the PRC, which
is intensifying its intervention in regional affairs and expanding its influence on
international affairs as it is gradually accumulating political, economic and military
strength. From a wider perspective, the global security situation remains in a state
with both “competition and cooperation,” regional powers continue to assume
leadership in regional developments, while small states strive to maximize benefits by
showing their core capabilities and critical roles through competitive advantages and
economic interactions.

The concept of “comprehensive security” has received great attention in recent years,
and equal importance has been attached to conventional and unconventional security
issues. Conventional security issues are urgent issues that directly concern national
security, mostly involve disputes over a nation’s sovereignty, territory, ethnicity and
religion, and will easily result in regional armed conflicts. Following technological
advancements, major countries are all developing and acquiring new weapon systems,
establishing new strategies and tactics for new forms of warfare, and competing
to gain an edge in military strength. In addition, the proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction and technologies, such as missiles and nuclear weapons, remains
a matter closely followed by the international society due to its high psychological
intimidation and possibility of severe casualties; such matters desperately need to be
controlled via international cooperation.

Due to potential damage to lives and properties and psychological shock that might
result from unconventional security issues, the attention that such issues attract has
surpassed that of conventional security issues; countries around the world are very
serious about early warning and response measures for natural disasters, such as
earthquakes, torrential rain, tsunami, landslides and volcano eruptions. Furthermore,
competition over maritime rights, energy exploitation, food production and water
resources could easily trigger conflicts and that impact interactions between countries.

Also, terrorist attacks by religious fanatics or political extremists are still frequent,
causing severe loss of lives and properties as they are prone to select conspicuous
facilities or landmarks where crowds gather. And although the international society
has joined together to condemn terrorism, terrorist activities are still frequent in
Southeast Asia, South Asia and the Middle East. The global counter-terrorism
environment has become even more complicated after Al-Qaeda founder and leader
Osama Bin Laden was taken out by U.S. forces.

I. Asia

( Ⅰ ) PRC

The continuous economic development of the PRC in recent years has not only
strengthened its comprehensive national power but also its confidence and intention
to increase its regional and international influence. Although the PRC has attempted
to reduce international suspicions over its growing overall national power through
measures, such as “harmonious world,” “friendly diplomacy” and “international
peacekeeping,” its rapidly expanding military strength continues to constrain
the development of cross-strait relations and threaten the security of relevant
regions. Moreover, the PRC’s defense transparency falls far short of international
expectations. The PRC will remain a challenge and threat to global security and
stability if it does not raise its defense transparency, reveal clear strategic intentions,
and improve its current conditions of human rights and rule of law according to the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

( Ⅱ ) Korean Peninsula

The military standoff between South and North Korea has lasted for over half a
century since 1950. The barriers and wide gap between ideologies cannot be removed
within any short period of time. The current situation on the Korean Peninsula is
complex and volatile. However, both Koreas have reinstated political dialogue
under international concern, and are focusing on economic and social exchanges,
interactions and developments. Moreover, recent observations of the territorial
dispute over sovereignty of the Dokdo Island (referred to as Takeshima by Japan)

have found no signs that the issue will be successfully resolved. North Korea has long
had a depressed economy and severe food shortage, and is currently undergoing a
leadership succession. To ensure the continuation of its regime and to gain bargaining
chips, North Korea has not ruled out the continued use of diplomatic strategies to
create negotiation space, in which it will wait for opportunities to seek interests.

North Korea’s development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technologies
has always been the primary uncertainty in Northeast Asia’s stability, and has been
a matter of concern to the U.S., Japan and South Korea. North Korea has conducted
numerous missile tests and nuclear tests in recent years, which have affected
regional peace and stability. The United Nations and international society have thus
condemned and imposed sanctions against North Korea. The sinking of South Korea’s
navy ship in March 2010 and bombardment on Yeonpyeong Island in November
the same year show that the situation on the Korean Peninsula is closely related to

Part 1 Strategic Environment

Chapter 1 Security Situation


-----

the security and stability of Asia. In response to North Korea’s provocation, South
Korea has accelerated its force development to enhance its strategic warning and
contingency response capabilities. This includes strengthening defense infrastructure
on offshore islands, as well as joint response capabilities of the U.S.-South Korean
military alliance, so as to ensure its national security. Countries within the region have
also convened Six-Party Talks to build a consensus and integrate resources in hopes
of resolving regional security threats. The effectiveness of this mechanism, however,
requires further observation.

( Ⅲ ) Japan

After Japan’s leadership transferred from the Liberal Democratic Party to the
Democratic Party in September 2009, the policy for relocation of the U.S. military
base in Japan was changed for a while; differences in the perspectives of the parties
impacted U.S.-Japan relations. Afterwards, the Japanese government adopted a
cooperative stand and reiterated its intention to strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance,
hoping to mend their relations. The U.S. thus declared its determination to defend
Japan, and U.S.-Japan relations gradually warmed up. On March 11[th], 2011, Japan
was devastated by a complex disaster (the strong earthquake caused a large tsunami
that damaged a nuclear power plant and resulted in radiation leakage) that caused the
most severe loss of lives and properties since World War II. The U.S. immediately
dispatched its carrier strike group after the disaster to assist with disaster relief and
subsequent reconstruction, fulfilling its commitment to safeguard Japan’s security;
this is expected to further benefit U.S.-Japan relations.

In Japan’s latest “National Defense Program Guideline” released in December 2010,
the PRC’s military expansion and North Korea’s development of nuclear weapons
were listed as potential threats to the region. To respond to sudden situations in the
region, Japan plans to enhance its submarine, ballistic missile defense, intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance, and long-range delivery capabilities, and is
gradually strengthening defense capabilities of offshore islands to the southwest;
related organizational restructuring and armaments establishment are matters
of regional strategic balance, and have raised high concern among surrounding
countries. Japan could face numerous challenges in the future.Currently, Japan is
still involved in a number of disputes with surrounding countries over territory and

maritime rights, including the East China Sea oil and gas fields, Takeshima (referred
to as Dokdo Island by South Korea) and the northern islands (referred to as the Kuril
Islands by Russia), and it has affected regional security situation. Russia’s President
and Minister of National Defense set foot on the Kuril Islands in November 2010 and
February 2011 respectively to declare Russia’s sovereignty, escalating the territorial
dispute between Japan and Russia. Whether or not these disputes can be resolved via
diplomatic means and a peaceful negotiation process is a key focus of the region in
the future.

( Ⅳ ) Southeast Asian Countries

Thanks to reviving global economy and the free trade agreement between ASEAN
and the PRC taking effect in 2010, effective regional economic integration in
Southeast Asia has benefited its stable political development. With regard to domestic
affairs of each country, the Philippines completed its presidential election and saw
a successful party alternation; Thailand’s Prime Minister Abhisit Vajjajiva initiated
a reconciliation between political parties, and the situation of the National United
Front of Democracy Against Dictatorship was alleviated; Myanmar held the first
presidential election in 1990, released the dissident Aung San Suu Kyi, who had been
under house arrest since 2003, and gradually began making contact with European
and American countries. After signing the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in
Southeast Asia with the U.S., ASEAN held the first “ADMM+8” in October 2010,
and for the first time invited the U.S. and Russia to attend the East Asia Summit in an
attempt to balance the PRC’s strength. Furthermore, with regard to territorial disputes
in the South China Sea, surrounding countries are reinforcing their armaments in
response to the PRC’s gradual expansion of its maritime rights. The U.S. advocated
freedom of navigation in the South China Sea to protect its regional security interests,
and proposed the use of a multilateral mechanism to resolve disputes. In the future,
as major powers, such as the U.S. and Russia, start interfering with Southeast
Asian affairs, whether ASEAN’s status is elevated or diluted depends on whether
or not it will be able to serve critical functions, create a balanced situation through
participation of major powers, strengthen internal integration and expand external
cooperation.

( Ⅴ ) South Asian Countries

In South Asia, India is the regional power in control of the Indian Ocean, and has
the potential to become an international power. However, the PRC strengthening its

political and military relations with Pakistan has interfered with South Asian affairs,
and it is continuing to expand its influence and diluting India’s leadership, impacting
India’s competitive advantages. In recent years, the PRC’s comprehensive national
power has increased, its force projection has extended to the Indian Ocean, and its
influence has expanded to South Asia, impacting India’s strategic visions and plans.
This has affected India’s execution of military missions and become and major
worry of India’s national security, causing India to accelerate navy and air force
developments and strengthen its relations with the United States. At present, there is
still a perception gap between India and the PRC on Tibet, the borderline between the
two states, and its position as a permanent member of the United Nations Security
Council. As the PRC’s military power continues to expand, it will likely take on a
tougher attitude when facing India or South Asian issues, and will become a new
source of uncertainty to security situation in South Asia.

( Ⅵ ) Middle East Countries

The Middle East is located at the intersection of Europe, Asia and Africa and has
abundant crude oil resources; its strategic position and economic interests have been
attached with great importance by powers around the world. After U.S. President
Barack Obama assumed office in January 2009, he formally announced that military
operations in Iraq would end on August 31st, 2010, and that U.S. troops would
completely withdraw from Iraq by the end of 2011, indicating that the U.S. will
gradually return the responsibility of Iraq’s reconstruction to Iraq’s government.
Iraq’s parliamentary election was held in March 2010. After negotiations between
political parties, President Jalal Talabani was reelected in November. Important
government officials took up their posts in December, showing that the political
deadlock is gradually being resolved. Nevertheless, the timetable set by the U.S.
Army might be delayed as a result of the complex distribution of power and disputes
between factions in Iraq and sporadic terrorist attacks, which impact Iraq’s political
and military stability, as well as social harmony.

In Iran’s presidential election in June 2009, opposition forces pressured the
government as the legitimacy of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s reelection and
the election process was questioned. Moreover, Iran has continued to implement
its nuclear research and development project, which has been highly questioned by
the Western world, and although the international society has imposed economic
sanctions against Iran, whether or not it will sway Iran’s determination to develop
nuclear weapons requires further observation. In addition, Saudi Arabia has allocated
a large budget to procure advanced armaments from the U.S. to match Iran’s possible
acquisition of nuclear weapons, and to further strengthen its defense capabilities after
the U.S. Army withdraws from Iraq, thereby ensuring its military advantage. The
development of strategic situation of the Middle East and how countries will interact
would remain noteworthy matters to surrounding countries

A fundamental solution has long evaded Israel and Pakistan in their conflicts. Many
countries have joined hands to help advance peace negotiations, currently focusing
on the dispute over the settlement in East Jerusalem. However, the two governments
are still dealing with internal disputes regarding the peace negotiations, making a
concrete outcome unlikely in the near future. A democratic movement (Jasmine
Revolution) erupted in the North African country Tunisia in January 2011, and
influenced anti-government protests and mass conflicts of different levels in nearby
countries, including Yemen, Jordan, Syria, Bahrain, Iraq, Iran, Oman and Saudi
Arabia, planting seeds of democracy that will continue to affect political development
and regional stability in the Middle East.

II. Europe

( Ⅰ ) European Union

The “Treaty of Lisbon” took effect in December 2009, and the European Union (EU)
newly established a permanent president and high representative of foreign affairs
and security policy. The Treaty is a milestone for further political and economic
integration of European countries. Furthermore, the EU has continued to strengthen
its relations with partners to the east and Mediterranean countries, extending its
influence via cooperation in free trade, energy security and defense affairs.

As the EU began accelerating the integration of member states, it was faced with
global security challenges, such as the global financial crisis and climate changes.
Many European countries were presented with immense fiscal deficits and high
unemployment rates, forcing their governments to cut down on public expenditures
and defense budgets, establish military cooperation with other states, downsize their
forces, and either reduce or suspend armaments procurements. Such fiscal deficits has
affected economic revitalization, and caused security risks in Europe. Additionally,
international terrorist organizations, e.g. the Al-Qaeda, are using a number of


32


-----

**_mechanisms in response to the conflict on the Korean Peninsula, so as to jointly face the_**
**_growing regional threat. (Source: US DoD)_**

methods, e.g. parcel bombs to attack European countries, showing that terrorist
activities have become a threat to the security situation and social stability in Europe,
and must be handled via international cooperation.

( Ⅱ ) Russia

Russia’s national strength has gradually been revived in recent years as it has
continued to improve its economic institution and expand energy cooperation.
Besides completing the establishment and reformation of military regions, Russia has
also implemented numerous energy channel cooperation plans, and plans to utilize
its energy resources to secure its status as a great power. In addition, after Russia
proposed the “European Security Treaty,” NATO announced new strategic concepts,
the U.S. adjusted its missile defense system deployment plan for East Europe, and
the U.S. and Russia signed “New START” and reached a consensus to reduce nuclear
weapons. This has allowed Russia to successfully alleviate its tense relations with
NATO and the U.S. after military conflicts with Georgia in 2008, and communication
and cooperation should be restored for international security issues in the future.

III. The Americas

( Ⅰ ) The U.S.

The Obama Administration implemented a number of reforms after assuming
office. However, the American economy’s revitalization was not as expected.
High unemployment rates impacted social stability, and the governing party – the
Democratic Party lost control of the Senate in the mid-term election, causing even
more uncertainty for future policy formulation and implementation. In terms of
international counter-terrorism measures, substantial results have been obtained at the
current stage. 2011 had been set to see complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq
and focus will shift to Afghanistan. Exchanges with the PRC and counter-terrorism
cooperation with India and Pakistan will be strengthened. The U.S. stands from a
cooperation and coordination point of view in handling major international issues,
and will deepen exchanges and cooperation with Japan, South Korea, India, the EU
and ASEAN, as well as regional organizations. Furthermore, the U.S. is strengthening
mutual trust with the PRC and Russia, and striving for cooperation in global security
affairs in hopes of maintaining its international leadership.

The U.S. continues to station contingency response forces in the Asia-Pacific region
based on the “Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States
and Japan” and “U.S.-South Korea Mutual Defense Treaty,” and holds numerous
joint exercises each year to verify its defense capabilities and show its determination
to ensure regional stability, including “Keen Sword,” “Key Resolve,” “Foal Eagle,”
“Cobra Gold,” “CARAT” and “Balikatan.” The U.S. currently has over 300 thousand
troops stationed in Asia. This force plays an important role in the response to regional
emergencies and the execution of humanitarian relief.

After the series of conflicts starting from the sinking of a South Korean navy ship
to North Korea bombing Yeonpyeong Island, the U.S. stepped up the frequency
and scale of joint military exercises with South Korea in response to North Korea’s
provocation. In addition to Japan sending observers to participate in U.S.-Korean
exercises for the first time, the U.S., Japan and South Korea decided to strengthen
intelligence exchange mechanisms and hold negotiation meetings starting in 2011,
showing that cooperation measures to strengthen security have been adopted to face
common threats. At present, the U.S. is adjusting its forces in the Asia-Pacific region

and strengthening missile launching capabilities of its force on Guam, protecting
freedom of navigation in high sea and responding to unexpected security threats
within the region (e.g. nuclear weapons of North Korea, territorial disputes and
terrorist activities), so as to maintain regional peace and stability and protect its

national interests.

( Ⅱ ) Central and South American Countries

In Central and South American Countries, frequent natural disasters, e.g. strong
earthquakes in Haiti and Chile, hurricanes in Central America, and the cholera
epidemic in Haiti, have resulted in losses exceeding U.S.$100 billion and affected the
overall economic development of the region. The territorial dispute over the Falkland
Islands between England and Argentina, dispute over coastal areas and territorial
seas between Nicaragua and Honduras, and the escalation of border issues between
Nicaragua and Costa Rica are all affecting regional stability. Moreover, the agreement
on military cooperation between the U.S. and Colombia was opposed by left-wing
governments led by Venezuela and developed into an arms race. Illegal cross-border
economic activity, gang crimes and drug trafficking continue to compromise regional
security.

In addition, Chile, Uruguay, Bolivia, Costa Rica and Brazil all successfully completed
their presidential elections. After the change in the political situation of Honduras,
the regime of democratically-elected president Porfirio Lobo Sosa has gradually
stabilized as he actively expanded diplomatic efforts. Venezuela, Bolivia and Brazil
continue to strengthen their political and military interactions, exchanges and
cooperation with Russia and the PRC via their energy strategy. Future developments

of their active efforts to elevate their regional status are especially noteworthy.

IV. Oceania

Australia continues to dominate political, economic and military situation in Oceania.
Australia experienced a change of leadership in June 2010 due to the government
not meeting public expectations. Its political situation has gradually stabilized after
its Parliament settled down. Australia has long been an ally of the U.S., but is trying
to maintain balanced diplomatic relations with both the U.S. and PRC due to the

influence of the PRC’s powerful economy. This might affect its diplomatic policy
and impact the alliance and strategic relations between the U.S. and Australia. New
Zealand released its national defense white paper in November 2010, and stressed
that it will cooperate with Australia in jointly maintaining regional security.

South Pacific island countries mostly rely on foreign aid for economic development
due to the singularity of their economic structure; unstopping internal disputes have
resulted in social instability and affected overall national development. However,
utilizing the strategic position of their geographic location and abundant natural
resources, South Pacific island countries have been actively promoting regional
cooperation via mechanisms such as international forums to attract aid from other
countries. This has created increasing competition between traditional powers, such
as the U.S., England and France, and emerging powers, such as Japan and the PRC,
which has actively expanded aid and investments in recent years.

Global warming effects, such as extreme climate, melting of polar ice caps and
frequent earthquakes, in recent years have affected countries around the world.
Oceania is no exception. The once in a century flood in Australia in January 2011,
major earthquake in New Zealand in February 2011, and island countries, such as
Palau, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Solomon Islands, at risk of their national soil becoming
submerged, these have all severely impacted the social stability and survival of
countries within the region.

V. Africa

Due to the continuous conflicts between ethnic groups, tribes and regions in Africa,
political development has shown limited results compared with other areas; however,
democracy has become a growing trend. In which North African countries along the
Mediterranean, including Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco, have been
more significantly influenced by Europe due to their closer geographical location.

The democratic movement in Tunisia in January 2011 ignited a fire that spread
through the Arabic world in North Africa. Mass movements of various scales
appeared in Egypt, Libya, Algeria, Morocco and Djibouti, and challenged the
authority of their government’s in pursuit of democracy, producing deep effects
on future political reform, human rights development, liberty and democracy in

the region. Among them the Libya government used its military to suppress the
anti-government protest, and forced the United Nations Security Council to pass a
decision to intervene, in which France, England and the U.S. responded with actual
military action. This shows that liberty, democracy and human rights have become
universal values in the international society.

With regard to economic issues, food safety has gradually become a strategic and
security issue discussed by African countries. With an eye on the rich natural and
human resources in the area, large nations around the world, including the U.S.,
Russia, PRC, India and European countries, have been actively interfering with
African affairs to protect their interests in its resources, and hoping to expand their
influence. However, economic development activities involve competing interests and
frequently cause disturbances, which have further affected the political stability of the
countries concerned. Furthermore, low education and medical levels have resulted

in insufficient labor force and retarded economic development. The significant
results of South Africa’s economic development have allowed it to be listed among
the “BRICS countries,” and be selected as a non-permanent member of the United
Nations Security Council in January 2011. Whether or not this will effectively drive
overall development of Africa, expand its economic scale, and improve its people’s
living conditions depends on the consensus and cooperation of African regional
organizations.

Section 2 Asia-Pacific Security Trends

Since the beginning of this century, conventional military security issues of the AsiaPacific region have been replaced by the threat of the PRC’s military expansion,
conflicts on the Korean Peninsula, disputes over maritime rights and soverignity
in East Asia, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. With regard to
unconventional issues, international terrorism, food and water resources, economic
security, energy security, infectious diseases, climate anomolies and major natural
disasters, disputes over surrounding sea areas and maritime safety are all issues that
cannot be resolved by any single country. Such issues require joint efforts of countries
in the Asia-Pacific region and solutions are even more difficult to find compared with
conventional security issues.

I. Conventional Security Issues

( Ⅰ ) Expansion of the PRC’s Power

Benefiting from the rapid development of comprehensive national power and
economic strength, PRC defense budget has maintained double digit growth rates for
over two decades and accelerated military modernization. Following the continuous
expansion of military strength, the PRC has had frequent military activity in the AsiaPacific region in recent years, and adopted a tougher stand on its sovereignty and
territorial integrity. This development has raised suspicion and alert in surrounding
countries, including Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and India, and formed U.S.-PRC
strategic competition on regional security issues.

PRC military development currently focuses on the development and deployment
of various ballistic and cruise missiles of the Second Artillery Force, military
modernization of its air force and navy, enhancement of missile launching
capabilities, establishment of information and electronic warfare capabilities and
joint operations capabilities. Furthermore, the PRC is actively developing “AntiAccess/Area Denial” capabilities and related tactics and techniques, attempting to
deter or deny intervention by other armed forces in the Taiwan Strait. Summarizing
analyses by domestic and foreign think tanks, the PRC should be able to complete

-----

and gradually deploy aircraft carriers by 2020, coupled with the development of new
generation stealth fighters and integrated development of aerospace/aerial capabilities,
the balance of military strength in the Asia-Pacific region will likely shift and even
turn into an arms race.

Generally speaking, from an economic perspective, Asia-Pacific countries believe
the rise of the PRC to be an opportunity and challenge; however, from a security
perspective, Asia-Pacific countries remain suspicious of the PRC’s military
expansion, and besides strengthening their own defense capabilities, they also hope
that the U.S. will retain a military force to a certain extent in the Asia-Pacific region,
so as to maintain regional stability.

( Ⅱ ) Conflicts on the Korean Peninsula

The situation on the Korean Peninsula tensed up in 2009 after North Korea’s
“Taepodong-2” missile test in April and second underground nuclear test in May
2009. South Korea’s navy ship was sunk in March 2010, and the bombing of
Yeonpyeong Island in November the same year escalated the situation on the Korean
Peninsula to the brink of war, impacting regional security and stability. To warn North
Korea to restrain military actions, the U.S. and South Korea stepped up joint military
exercises in the Yellow Sea, which at one point stressed the relations between the U.S.
and PRC.

North Korea has been developing nuclear weapons and mid-range and long-range
ballistic missiles for years, and has enough plutonium to produce several nuclear
warheads. In November 2010, North Korea showed visiting American scientists the
gas centrifuge for uranium enrichment in its Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research
Center, showing its determination to expand nuclear weapon capabilities. North
Korea’s military actions in 2010 raised international concern over its plans for
developing nuclear weapons and missiles, and fear that North Korea will proliferate
missile and nuclear technologies to other countries.

In response to North Korea’s nuclear weapons and military threat, South Korea joined
the regional “Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI)” led by the U.S., Japan is actively
establishing missile defense capabilities, and both countries have strengthened their
military cooperation with the United States. The PRC, U.S. and Russia hope to

restart “Six-Party Talks,” using its negotiation measures to resolve the crisis of North
Korea’s nuclear weapons and military threat. To Asia-Pacific countries, conflicts on
the Korean Peninsula are a major regional security issue that requires joint effort
among countries.

( Ⅲ ) Territorial Seas and Sovereignty Disputes in East Asia

After the end of the Cold War, ground territorial disputes in the Asia-Pacific region
decreased as states turned their focus to sea. After the “United Nations Convention on
the Law of the Sea” was announced in 1982, competition further escalated between
the state parties over sea rights in continental shelf and exclusive economic zone.
This has significantly affected international relations and regional interaction and
developments in the Asia Pacific region as countries spare no effort in the competition
for maritime resources and rights.

Part 1 Strategic Environment
41

Chapter 1 Security Situation


-----

At present, major disputes over maritime rights and sovereignty in the Asia-Pacific
region include territorial dispute over the South China Sea between the ROC, PRC
and surrounding countries; territorial dispute over the Diaoyutai Islands between the
ROC, PRC and Japan; territorial dispute over the Kuril Islands between Russia and
Japan; territorial dispute over the Dokdo Island between South Korea and Japan,
territorial dispute over “Okinotorishima” and East China Sea oil and gas fields
between the PRC and Japan. Especially noteworthy is the PRC in 2010 claimed that
the South China Sea was “core interests concerning the territorial integrity of China,”
which made surrounding countries apprehensive and raised concern in the U.S. of
freedom of navigation in this international water.

( Ⅳ ) Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction

The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction has always been a security issue
attached with great importance in the U.S. and Russia. The immense fear and
security threat created by such weapons have attracted high levels of concern in
the international society. Over the years, the international society has attempted to
ensure the peaceful use of nuclear energy, to prohibit the production of biological and
chemical weapons, to reduce the number of existing nuclear weapons, and to prevent
weapons of mass destruction and its technology from being acquired by specific
countries and non-state actors. Related international treaties and organizations include
the “Biological Weapons Convention (BWC),” “Chemical Weapons Convention
(CWC),” “Nuclear non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT),” “Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty (START),” “New START,” “International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)”
and “Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).” However,
as North Korea and Iran continue to develop nuclear weapons, the Asia-Pacific
region cannot free itself from the threat of weapons of mass destruction. Therefore,
countries in this region must adopt more effective prevention measures and take part
in international cooperation to respond to potential security situations.

II. Unconventional Security Issues

( Ⅰ ) Pervasion of International Terrorism

Terrorist activities have gradually become international in recent years, in which the
Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia are among the areas where international
terrorism is most prevalent. The Al Qaeda, Taliban and Hezbollah have continued to
launch terrorist attacks in Iraq, Yemen, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Indonesia, Thailand
and the Philippines, endangering their security and social peace. The death of Osama
Bin Laden in a U.S. operation also added to the uncertainty of the regional security
situation.

Asia-Pacific countries have discussed counter-terrorism measures through multilateral mechanisms, handling counter-terrorism issues via international cooperation.
For example, 18 states participated in the first “ADMM+8” in Vietnam in 2010,
and declared the strengthening of counter-terrorism cooperation in the “Hanoi
Declaration.” The ROC has also strengthened counter-terrorism cooperation with
Asia-Pacific countries through the platform of the Counter-Terrorism Task Force
(CTTF) under the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).

( Ⅱ ) Food and Water Resources

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) announced that global food prices
hit a historic high in December 2010, even surpassing that of the food crisis in 2008
which caused a global disturbance. Insufficiency of food is the most serious in the
Asia-Pacific region, in which 25 states face food shortages. Rice, corn and wheat
output in some parts of Asia is gradually decreasing, mainly because of temperature
rises, increased frequency of El Nino and water shortages caused by lower rainfall.
The FAO indicated that the soaring food prices will make famine and poverty issues
even more severe in developing countries and least developed countries in the AsiaPacific region.

Developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region, such as India, Pakistan, Nepal and
Bangladesh, are undergoing rapid urbanization and industrialization. Their continuous
population growth has resulted in higher demand on water resources. Decreased
water resources and increased droughts have produced negative effects on agriculture,

Part 1 Strategic Environment

Chapter 1 Security Situation

-----

water supply, energy production and development and hygiene. Following the rise
in temperatures, drop in rainfall and snowfall, and increased water demand, in some
parts of Mainland China growingly water shortage has resulted in lakes, ponds and
rivers drying up. In the world’s second largest export country of rice – Vietnam,
Mekong River delta – the “granary” will significantly reduce production due to
water shortage and soil alkalization; this affects all surrounding countries, including
Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia

In view of the growingly severe food supply crisis faced by Asia-Pacific countries,
the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific
published the “Report on Sustainable Agricultural Development and Food Safety in
the Asia-Pacific region” in 2009, calling on governments of each state to enhance
its food acquisition capabilities via the establishment of various social protection
systems, basic medical systems and agriculture insurance Sustainable agriculture
should be promoted to prevent food production from being severely affected by soil
degradation caused by destructive farming, water sources contaminated by pesticides,
and damages to the ecological environment cause by deforestation. Support should
be strengthened for small scale agriculture production. Response measures should be
adopted for the effect of climate changes on agriculture, while regional cooperation
reinforced to jointly face food crises..

( Ⅲ ) Economic Security

The status of economic factors in international relations gradually rose after the Cold
War. Under the influence of economic globalization, comprehensive national strength
competition in the Asia-Pacific region that revolve around economy and technology
has become a focus of regional powers. Economic globalization has escalated
resource and market competition, and increased the risk to national economic
security.

The main economic security factor that affects future security trends in the AsiaPacific region is the change in relative economic strength of states in the region. The
PRC began its economic reform in 1978, and fully utilized resources brought by
global strategies of multi-national enterprises to drive rapid growth of its economy,
which also allowed the rapid increase of its influence in the regional security system.

中華民國壹百年

國防報告書

The Asia-Pacific economy is closely linked to the global market, and countries in the
region are prioritizing stable economic growth to protect the economic results they
have accumulated. The 2010 “Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)” pointed
out that APEC will continue to drive Regional Economic Integration (REI) in hopes
of achieving free trade and investment, and aims to establish a Free Trade Area of the
Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) using a building blocks approach based on existing regional
economic organizations, such as ASEAN+3, ASEAN+6 and the “Trans-Pacific
Strategic Economic Partnership (TPP).”

( Ⅳ ) Energy Security

A nation’s economic development relies on the stable supply and safe transportation
of energy and commodities. The increase in global energy demand driven by
economic development of emerging regional powers has resulted in tension in
energy supply. In recent years, conflicts over the exploitation of submarine oil fields,
Somali pirates on the international marine routes of the Gulf of Edin, natural disasters
and international disputes all pose as threats to each country’s energy supply. For
example, the flood in Queensland, Australia in January 2011 paralyzed the coal
mining industry’s exports. The PRC, Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines competing
for energy in their surrounding sea areas has caused Asia-Pacific countries to
reevaluate the importance of energy issues in relation to national security.

The nuclear crisis in Japan that derived from the huge earthquake in March 2011
brought the issue of nuclear safety into center stage in the international society.
Nuclear energy is an important source of civil energy, yet the peaceful use of nuclear
energy still involves a number of issues, including highly dangerous radiation, nuclear
safety, and nuclear waste disposal. Using East Asia and South Asia as an example,
there are a total of over 112 commercial scale nuclear power generators in the ROC,
PRC, Japan, South Korea, India and Pakistan, in which Japan with 54 generators
has the most nuclear power generators in the region and is continuing to build new
generators. Vietnam and Thailand, which currently are not using nuclear energy, are
also planning to build two nuclear power generators each. The International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) is responsible for establishing international regulations on the
limitations and management of nuclear energy; nuclear energy management requires

Chapter 1 Security Situation

-----

extremely high standards and self discipline to ensure its safety, and any nuclear
accident will become a transnational disaster that affects regional security.

( Ⅴ ) Infectious Diseases

The spread of infectious disease is a major threat to the health of mankind, e.g.
SARS, H1N1, aviation flu, CJD and VCJD (commonly known as mad cow disease).

Asian countries have currently established the Health Task Force (HTF) under
the framework of the APEC with consideration to infectious diseases, e.g. SARS,
Dengue Fever and HIV/AIDS, severely affecting regional economic activity, so as to
strengthen individual and overall capabilities of Asian countries to fend off infectious
diseases.

The military has rapid response and mobilization capabilities and possesses all
the required equipment. Therefore, the military is obligated to support epidemic
prevention, especially when a large scale outbreak occurs. The military’s response,
involvement and support to the government would determine the effectiveness of
epidemic prevention.

( Ⅵ ) Climate Anomalies and Major Natural Disasters

The frequency and intensity of extreme weather in Asia have increased since
the 20[th] century. Sea level rise has resulted in significant change in the marine
ecosystem, and caused tens of millions of people living on the coasts of South Asia
and Southeast Asia to face the threat of floods. The Asian tsunami in 2004 caused
severe casualties in South Asian and Southeast Asian countries, such as Sri Lanka,
Indonesia and Maldives. The long droughts in Russia and Northern China threatened
to create a shortage of grain and caused a rise in global wheat prices. The growingly
frequent climate anomalies and major natural disasters have caused a continuous
rise in casualties and losses, and will become too much of a burden to bear for most
developing countries in Asia.

When Asian countries must simultaneously face earthquake, tsunami, flood, fire, cold
and typhoon disasters, or “complex disasters,” which is when other disasters derive
from a natural disaster. Even when the initial natural disaster itself is not destructive,

the impact of food, water and energy shortages or contamination that follows might
be beyond their coping and response capabilities, further threatening national security
and regional stability.

To jointly face challenges brought by climate anomalies to the environment, the Asian
Disaster Reduction Center (ADRC) was established in 1998 to integrate capabilities
of Asian countries and build a framework for integrating disaster relief mechanisms
and dialogue. At present, the ADRC has adopted a series of plans to strengthen
disaster relief capabilities and talent cultivation in its member, and has constructed a
tightly knit communication network for jointly facing severe challenges brought by
climate changes.

( Ⅶ ) Disputes over Territorial Sea

There have long been disputes between coastal countries in the Asia-Pacific region
over sovereignty of islands and maritime rights. The “United Nations Convention on
the Law of the Sea” passed in 1982 states that “The exclusive economic zone shall
not extend beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of
the territorial sea is measured” (continental shelf can extend at most 350 nautical
miles), thus arousing the emphasis on maritime interests and competition for maritime
rights.

Disputes over resource exploitation, fishing rights and oceanographic survey
have been derived from different viewpoints regarding sovereignty over islands,
overlapping exclusive economic zones and the boundaries of such exclusive
economic zones; some disputes have even resulted in the confrontation of law
enforcement ships belonging to two states or even low intensity military conflicts.

中華民國壹百年

國防報告書

Asia-Pacific countries that are currently involved in disputes over sovereignty and
exclusive economic zones include the ROC, Japan, PRC and countries adjacent to the
South China Sea. In which our current disputes with Japan include sovereignty over
Diaoyutai, and fishing rights, maritime resource development and oceanographic
survey disputes originating from overlapping exclusive economic zones with Japan’s
Sakishima Islands. Our government has conducted 16 fishery negotiations with the
Japanese government since August 1996, but has not reached an agreement on related
issues.

Disputes between Japan and the PRC over maritime rights include Diaoyutai and the
Chunhsiao oil field. With regard to the Chunhsiao oil field, for the overlapping area of
each state’s exclusive economic zone in the East China Sea, both states are using the
“middle line” as a temporary borderline; the ministers of diplomatic affairs of both
states met in Tokyo to discuss the issue of developing oil and gas fields in the East
China Sea, during which Japan requested that the PRC initiate a joint development
treaty for negotiation, while the PRC indicated it will maintain informal negotiations.

Countries surrounding the South China Sea are occupying islands to gain maritime
rights and exclusive economic zone interests; currently the PRC, Philippines,
Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia and the ROC have all declared rights over a part or
whole of the South China Sea. Facing such dispute, the PRC and ASEAN signed the
“Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea” in 2002, for which
each party agreed to exercise self-restraint and avoid causing tension and conflict
in the South China Sea; the PRC proposed that they “put aside disputes and jointly
develop” the area. Whereas our government stood to communicate with surrounding
countries and peacefully resolve disputes based on the spirit of “sovereignty belongs
to us, to put aside disputes, peace and mutual beneficial, and joint development.”
Even so, fishery, oceanographic survey and energy exploitation activities have still
caused protests between different countries.

( Ⅷ ) Maritime Security

After the Cold War ended, any security threat to marine routes could become a
maritime security issue, e.g. smuggling, terrorism and piracy. In recent years, piracy
has raised concern in the international society, and pirates rampant in the Strait of

Malacca caused Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia to initiate the Strait of Malacca
Security Forum in October 2009, after which they formally set up the International
Maritime Organization Trust Fund to finance experimental projects to protect the
security of the Strait of Malacca. Furthermore, coastal countries and countries
accessing the route also committed jointly protect the security and smooth navigation
through the Strait of Malacca, so as to protect their collective interests. The endless
trouble caused by Somali pirates cause the UN to pass a decision in June 2008 on
the handling of Somali pirates, besides the U.S. and NATO sending convoys and
investigating pirates, the PRC used the opportunity to extend the long distance
operation and cooperation capabilities of its navy to the sea area off the Horn of
Africa, and on numerous occasions sent navy ships on convoy missions in Somali
waters.

Our economy relies heavily on exports, thus marine routes are the lifeline of our
economic development; piracy on marine routes greatly affects our maritime security.
The majority of illegal activities across the Taiwan Strait is smuggling, and has
developed into a new security issue. Criminals on both sides of the Taiwan Strait
smuggling firearms, narcotics or Mainland Chinese persons into Taiwan not only
affects social security and causes diseases to enter Taiwan, but also gives the PRC
opportunities to infiltrate and execute intelligence gathering missions, severely
endangering our national security.

the PRC has not slowed its military preparations against

Section 1 Current Status and Developments
of the PLA

Following the rise of the PRC’s comprehensive national strengthen, the domain that
it wishes to dominate has expanded correspondingly, and its military strategy must
satisfy demands accompanying this intention. In other words, the PRC has already
made some changes to its military strategy. The “Three Step” strategy for defense
and military developments announced by the PRC has apparently surpassed its
existing development plans, indicating that it hopes to build a military force with an
international perspective and matches its status.

I. Current Status of the PLA

Although cross-strait relations are becoming more and more stable, the PRC has
not renounced the use of military force against Taiwan. The PRC’s stable economic
growth in recent years has effectively supported its defense development and military
reform, which feature Chinese characteristics with an emphasis on information
warfare. As the PRC’s overall capabilities continue to grow, it is attempting to further
expand its regional influence.

( Ⅰ ) PRC Military Strategies

Even though cross-strait relations have somewhat relaxed, the PRC has not slowed its
military preparations against Taiwan. The PRC issued a white paper titled “China’s
National Defense in 2010” on March 31st, 2011. The white paper indicated that
China’s military preparations are aimed at large scale operations at its southeast coasts
to “oppose the independence of Taiwan and advance the unity of China.” Although
the PRC claims that it will continue to promote peaceful developments across the
Taiwan Strait, it remains concerned of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, and expressed
its dissatisfaction with the ROC and U.S. deepening military exchanges, believing
that it will endanger future U.S.-PRC relations. This shows that even though crossstrait relations have relaxed, the PRC has not ceased its military preparations against
Taiwan. Furthermore, the PRC’s continuous expansion of its military force, frequent

Chapter 2 Security Challenges

-----

military activities in the Asia-Pacific in recent years, and tough attitude over territorial
sovereignty has raised suspicion and alert in surrounding countries, forming the
strategic situation of the U.S. and PRC both competing and cooperating in regional
security issues, showing that the PRC has adjusted its military strategy in response to
the growth of its national strength. The PRC’s military strategies are analyzed below:

1. Military Strategy Adjustments

The PRC’s military strategies are founded on “active defense,” and after Hu
Jintao assumed office in 2002, the PRC’s strategic objectives and concepts
have been adjusted in response to the growth of its national strength.
Following the increasing importance of information technologies in warfare,
the PLA adopted “win limited wars under conditions of informatization” as
its strategic objective and “stopping wars and winning wars” as its strategic
concept. Since 2008, the PLA adjusted its military strategic concept to
“preventing crises and stopping wars,” and enhanced the capabilities of its
military for completing multifaceted military missions. In addition, the PRC
stressed that its “active defense” insists on the principle of “defend, selfdefense and strike only after the enemy has struck.” Although it appears that
the PRC will not actively provoke war, it is in fact prepared, and will be able
to overcome the enemy and control the war situation once the enemy strikes;
however, in essence this is a strategy to “take the initiative.”

2. Military Strategic Objectives

(1) Proposal of Defense and Military Modernization Developments

The PLA is actively implementing military modernization
developments to adapt to requirements of new situations. After
the strategic objective of defense and military modernization was
proposed in 1997, the PRC clearly indicated in 2009 that “future
efforts will be to achieve development objectives of the ‘Three
Step’ strategy, and step up defense and military modernization.”
In addition, in order to fundamentally achieve mechanization
and achieve greater developments for information infrastructure
before 2020, the PRC insists on using mechanization as a
foundation and informatization as its orientation for extensively
applying information technology results, driving mechanization


54


-----

中華民國壹百年

國防報告書

and informatization developments and integration in hopes of
modernizing its defense and military, and gradually expanding to
areas outside the Asia-Pacific.

(2) Emphasis on Talent Cultivation to Enhance Joint Operations
Capabilities

To develop into an informatized armed force, the PLA proposed
talent cultivation objectives and military knowledge requirements
for the next two decades, planning to enhance the competencies of
military personnel, as well as equip cadres with leadership skills
that will enable them to meet future joint operations requirements
before 2020. The “Outline of Military Training and Evaluation,”
which the PLA announced in 2008, clearly states that the focus
of cadre cultivation has gradually changed from the conventional
“armed service” to “joint operations, joint education and joint
training,” aiming to create a good talent cultivation environment to
substantially improve the quality of military strategy talents, which
are required for future joint operations, and also foster their joint
operations command skills; this outline aims to enhance the PLA’s
ability to cultivate new cadres for the future.

3. Military Strategy against Taiwan

Based on the PLA’s preparedness for taking military action against Taiwan
and developments of the situation in the Taiwan Strait, high level officers of
the PLA upgraded the military strategy against Taiwan at the end of 2008
from “using military force to oppose Taiwan independence” to “opposing
Taiwan independence and advancing the unity of China.” At the end of
2009, the PLA was required to enhance preparation results for contingency
response operations, in hopes of gaining the ability to launch large scale
operations against Taiwan and prevent interference from foreign forces
before 2020. It is obvious that although the possibility of military conflict
has decreased after cross-strait relations relaxed, and dealing with the
“Taiwan issue” might even be delayed, the PRC’s objective to unify Taiwan
has not changed. As the military strength of the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait becomes even more imbalanced, we are bound face growingly severe
military threats.

( Ⅱ ) Defense Budget of the PRC

The PRC’s defense budget has maintained double digit growth rates from 1989 to
2009 (20 years) to strengthen its defense and military modernization, and is equal
to the military expenditures of Russia, Japan and South Korea combined, ranking
first in Asia. Although the PRC has stressed over and over that its national defense is
defensive in nature, it hopes to build an elite highly effective modernized force under
the objective of “winning limited wars under conditions of informatization,” and has
implemented “military reform with Chinese characteristics.” For this reason the PRC
invests immense funds into the development of high-tech weapons, and is actively
making foreign procurements of weapons and importing technologies. However,
its accelerated development of defense modernization has gradually exceeded that
required for mere defense, and its continued defense budget growth has caused other
countries to feel deeply threatened.

1. Budgeting Approach

The PRC’s budgeting approach and purpose mainly aims to enhance the
PLA’s overall capabilities, conventional and unconventional weapons,
aerospace, manpower and educational training. Evaluations by different
sectors anticipate stable growth of China’s economy until 2020, therefore its
force development will continue receive adequate resources for achieve its
strategic objectives. Furthermore, the PRC has held back on the disclosure
of its defense budget as there is still immense hidden funding; “potential
threat” grows on a daily basis, and the balance between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait is at risk of being lost (the PRC’s defense budget from 2000 to
2011 is shown in Table 2-1).

2. Budget Overview

The PRC announced its 2011 defense budget at 601.1 billion RMB (equivalent
to U.S.$91.506 billion), increasing by 67.6 billion RMB compared with
2010 (the 2010 defense budget was 532.1 billion RMB) with a growth rate


Part 1 Strategic Environment

Chapter 2 Security Challenges


57


-----

of 12.7%. The PRC claimed that the budget increase will mainly be used to
support its military reform with Chinese characteristics; also, the budget
will be used for armaments, military training, talent cultivation, basic
infrastructure and military subsidies. The PRC hopes to enhance the PLA’s
capabilities for responding to multiple security threats and completing
multifaceted military missions, ensuring that needs of military reform
are satisfied while improving the living quality of its servicemen by an
appropriate degree.

3. Structural Analysis

According to the official defense budget announced by the PRC, the
budget is divided into three categories – “personnel living expenses,
training maintenance expenses, and equipment expenses” and used
for servicemen’s salaries, equipment maintenance, procurement and
research & development, each representing roughly 1/3 of the overall
defense budget. As a whole, the defense budget is already somewhat
inadequate for maintaining normal operations of the PLA’s 2.3 million
servicemen, not to mention Armed Police and those living on pension.
If the PLA intends to acquire new equipment and enhance its defense
capabilities, then it will require an even larger budget to support its
requirements. Therefore, the PRC’s actual expenditure must be hidden
under non-military departments.

4. Hidden Funding

The PRC has stressed that its military force serves only to protect its
sovereignty and the completeness of its territory, and does not pose
a threat to any country. The PRC claims that its defense budget is in
accordance with the National Defense Law and Budget Law, is included
in the central budget bill and sent to the “National People’s Congress”
for deliberation, so the hidden funding issue is nonexistent. However, the
PLA will require large amounts of funding if it is to build an elite highly
effective modernized force under the objective of winning limited wars
under conditions of informatization. Moreover, defense technology
research, arms sales revenue, arms procurement expenses, revenue of
defense industries and funding for Armed Police are all items that were
not included in the PRC’s defense budget. Therefore, as various funds
are listed under different budgets, there is still immense funding hidden
under non-military items. According to the “Military and Security


58


-----

中華民國壹百年

國防報告書

Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China 2010” issued by
the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the actual defense expenditure
of the PRC should be 2 to 3 times the amount it disclosed (roughly
U.S.$150~250 billion), and will cause severe imbalance of military
strength in the region.

5. Effects

Based on the PRC’s national interest developments and military
modernization objectives, although it claims that its defense budget is
relatively low compared with large states around the world, it will be
the world’s second largest military spender after considering its hidden
expenses, trailing only behind the U.S.. Under the circumstances of the
PRC unwilling to renounce the use of military force against Taiwan,
its continuous military modernization will add pressure to our national
defense, and should be followed with concern.

6. Future Developments

Faced with high tech local war, military strategy adjustments
and defense infrastructure requirements under the condition of
informatization of its new military reform, the PRC will have to
maintain the high growth rates of its defense budget, in order to establish
mechanized, informatized and integrated military infrastructure,
and adapt to requirements of its military reform and new era military
preparations; this development may become the start of a new arms race
within the region.

( Ⅲ ) Current Status of PLA Armaments Research and
Development

At present, the PLA is actively accelerating “mechanization” and “informatization”
developments, and renovating military training, military theories, military
technologies, military organizations and military management, so as to strengthen its
capabilities to “win limited wars under conditions of informatization” and carry out
“Military Operations Other Than War (MOOTW).” Moreover, the PLA is actively
engaged in the research and development of related armaments. The PLA’s current
status is analyzed below:


Part 1 Strategic Environment

Chapter 2 Security Challenges


59


-----

1. Ground Force Equipment

Equipment upgrade will be directed towards mechanization, and command
and control will be developed towards informatization. Modifications of
main battle tanks, multi-purpose armored vehicles, long-range MLRS and
various helicopter models will be actively researched, so as to strengthen
firepower suppression and strike, long distance maneuver and complex
electromagnetic environment combat capabilities of ground forces, hoping
to be capable of fast delivery via air and ground transport.

2. Navy Equipment

The PRC is importing and building new large combat ships, submarines
and missile boats; researching and procuring various classes and variants of
long-range anti-ship missiles; and, actively researching and building aircraft
carriers, carrier-based fighters and intercontinental range ballistic missiles.
Also, the PRC plans to develop new battleships, large amphibious assault
ships and submarines with air-independent propulsion systems, hoping
to gain control over the strategic domain west of the first island chain and
regional operation capabilities between the second island chain.

3. Air Force Equipment

The PRC is actively developing new generation fighters, large transport
aircrafts, and air-launched long-range precision weapons, and is continuing
to strengthen its missile defense system and accelerate command and control
information infrastructure, in hopes of gaining air superiority over the first
island chain. Furthermore, its new generation fights are gradually being
equipped with various long-range precision strike weapons, and the PLA
began importing foreign technologies in 2007 for the self-production of early
warning and electronic warfare support aircrafts, which have significantly
improved its early warning and battlefield control capabilities.

4. Second Artillery Equipment

The PRC has developed and tested numerous new variants of missiles;
at the same time it is improving the quality of existing missile systems,
and developing technologies with “defense penetration” capabilities to


60


-----

中華民國壹百年

國防報告書

counter missile defense systems. Furthermore, developments are being
directed towards “all-purpose and multifaceted” with an emphasis on high
precision, defense penetration conventional and nuclear warheads, hoping
to gain nuclear intimidation and strike capabilities, as well as complete its
conventional firepower strike network.

5. Aerospace Equipment

The PRC is actively developing new military reconnaissance and
communication satellites, anti-satellite weapons and large carrier rockets,
and focusing on enhancing image resolution, mobile communication and
maximum payload. Also, the PRC is accelerating the deployment of its
“Beidou” navigation satellites, and will continue to implement its manned
spacecraft and moon probe plans, so as to make breakthroughs in a series of
core technologies, including spacecraft rendezvous and docking and moon
landing and probing.

6. Information and Electronic Equipment

This section is divided into equipment for information warfare and
equipment for electronic warfare. In terms of information warfare, besides
actively developing computer viruses and establishing capabilities to
attack enemy computer and network systems, resources and information
talents from the private sector will be integrated to gain massive network
attack capabilities. In terms of electronic warfare, besides deploying new
communication disruption devices and various disruption bases, the PRC
has also built long-range disruption aircrafts and various anti-radiation
unmanned platforms and missiles with an emphasis on operations under
complex electromagnetic environments.

( Ⅳ ) Current Status of PLA Capabilities and Preparations

The PLA has continued to actively enhance its capabilities in recent years according
to its original plans. However, in view of its diplomatic policy “to become a good
neighbor and a good partner,” its exercises are based on “contingency operations
against Taiwan” and target tactics and techniques of the ROC Armed Forces. In which


Part 1 Strategic Environment

Chapter 2 Security Challenges


61


-----

its joint landing exercises still mainly target Taiwan, and apply enhanced capabilities
of area-denial, accumulating large scale operations capabilities.

1. Ground Force Capabilities

The PLA’s Ground Force development focuses on “mechanization” and
“informatization” according to its force restructuring plans. The PLA is
actively building a ground force with Chinese characteristics, and continues
to refine its organizational structure and improve training results, so as to
strengthen combat and contingency response capabilities. Over the past year,
guided by the transformation from “regional defense” to “global mobility,”
the PLA has concentrated on equipping the Nanjing and Guangzhou
military regions with new amphibious assault vehicles and new MLRS, and
expanding armored outfits and electronic countermeasure outfits in the Tibet
and Xinjiang Autonomous Regions, implementing “mechanization” and
“informatization” to enhance its capabilities of operations across the Taiwan
Strait and defense operations on its western frontier.

2. Navy Capabilities

The PRC Navy’s developments focus on enhancing its strategic
intimidation and counter attack capabilities, gradually developing open
water management and cooperation and unconventional threat response
capabilities (e.g. counter-terrorism operations, right-safeguard cruise and
disaster relief). The PLA Navy has sent battleships in batches to execute
commercial ship convoy missions in the Gulf of Aden since 2008, besides
verifying the performance and combat capabilities of new equipment, these
missions serve to intensify joint operations training for multiple armed
services, as well as live exercises. This shows that its strategic concept has
gradually shifted from “offshore defense” to “open water defense,” as it is
actively building battleships and deploying long-range anti-ship missiles on
its coasts, and gradually expanding the depth of maritime operations and
anti-access capabilities.


62


-----

中華民國壹百年

國防報告書


3. Air Force Capabilities

The PLA’s Air Force developments focus on enhancing reconnaissance,
early warning, air strike, air-defense, anti-missile and strategic delivery
capabilities. In recent years, the PLA Air Force has been actively acquiring
new precision strike weapons and informatized command and control
equipment, and has been participating in joint exercises and training, which
have significantly strengthened its long-range precision strike and strategic
delivery capabilities. Furthermore, it is actively improving its air force bases
and battlefield protection facilities, and strengthening its logistics protection
system, thereby elevating its comprehensive protection capabilities for
combat equipment. In addition, guided by the change in strategy from
“homeland air defense” to “balanced offense and defense,” the PLA Air
Force continues to upgrade its equipment to third generation fighters and
new air defense missiles to strengthen its overall air defense capabilities.

4. Second Artillery Capabilities

Developments of the PLA’s Second Artillery seek a balance between nuclear
and conventional and use both solid and liquid. The Second Artillery
has continued to improve the precision and effectiveness of its missiles;
develop middle range ballistic missiles for targeting ships and independently
targetable intercontinental range ballistic missiles; strengthen the
penetration, precision and nuclear intimidation capabilities of its missiles;
and, established a new ballistic missiles brigade outfitted with middle range
ballistic missiles, so as to strengthen its overall missile strike effectiveness.
The Second Artillery already has some capability of attacking aircraft
carriers. Furthermore, the current quantity, accuracy and effectiveness of
the Second Artillery’s missiles, combined with forces of the Air Force and
Navy, are already capable of launching large scale joint fire support strikes
and sea and air blockades.

5. Aerospace Capabilities

Military satellites currently in orbit are capable of supporting operation
command and control of PLA forces west of the first island chain,

-----

daytime and nighttime surveillance and reconnaissance, and intelligence
transmission. Furthermore, after the “Beidou” navigation satellite system
consisting of 35 satellites is completed in 2020, the PRC will no longer be
dependent on the U.S. GPS, and will effectively enhance the precision of its
long-range precision weapons.

6. Information and Electronic Warfare Capabilities

The PLA stresses that gaining an electromagnetic advantage early in battle
is a key task to ensuring the success of operations, and has thus been
strengthening its “integrated network and electronic warfare” capabilities
in recent years. Using electronic warfare and computer network warfare
as a means, coupled with the application of hardware kills, the PLA will
adopt “integrated network and electronic warfare” as a basic form of joint
operations, so as to gain control over electromagnetic spectrums. If the PRC
engages in a military conflict with its surrounding countries, this will help it
seize “electromagnetic control” over the battlefield early in battle.

II. PRC Military Developments

The PRC’s strategic concept has changed from “defensive” to “expansion” since
1992 as a result of effects of the Gulf War and military reforms around the world. The
PRC places emphasis on requirements for “determining the victory in the first battle
and quick victory in distant battles,” as well as the new “Outline of Military Training
and Evaluation”; its force development is focusing on operations beyond its borders,
and aims to not only prevent wars, but also win wars.

( Ⅰ ) Showing Confidence in Military Strategies

Up to now the PRC still emphasizes its “active defense” military strategy, and
added a new policy – “insisting on a defensive strategy and the principle of striking
only after the enemy has struck.” “Self-defense” and “striking only after the enemy
has struck” was highlighted by the PRC to controvert “The Military Power of the
People’s Republic of China” issued by the U.S. Department of Defense, which stated
that China’s “active defense” contained implications of initiating attacks, in hopes of


64


-----

中華民國壹百年

國防報告書

removing suspicions of the international society. In the “Three Step” development
strategy for defense modernization, the PRC has advanced its timetable and changed
its strategic objective to “fundamentally achieve mechanization and enable greater
developments for information infrastructure before 2020, and fundamentally realize
the objective of defense and force modernization by mid-21[st] century.” Evidently,
the PLA’s force development is ahead of schedule, and it is using this opportunity to
show its ambition and confidence in its military strategies.

( Ⅱ ) Unwillingness to Renounce the Use of Military Force
against Taiwan

To this day the PLA’s force deployment against Taiwan has not changed, only
that its military build-up and exercises targeting Taiwan have been more “subtle,”
shifting to either the north or south. In terms of the security situation in the Taiwan
Strait, evaluations show gradual improvement in cross-strait relations, and the PRC
deleted its statement “Taiwan authorities taking a radical Taiwan independence
route threatens regional peace.” Nevertheless, the PRC continues to stress that the
“Taiwan independence” separatist force is a threat to its territorial sovereignty and
security, and objected that the U.S. continuing arms sales to Taiwan was a violation
of the “Three Joint Communiqués.” In recent years, the PLA has continued to outfit
its Fukien and Guangdong military regions with amphibious assault vehicles, longrange MLRS, battleships, long-range anti-ship missiles, third generation fighters,
air defense missiles and middle range ballistic missiles with an emphasis on the
enhancement of long-range delivery capabilities. Up to now the PRC has not showed
military good will towards Taiwan, making it evident that its thoughts of intimidation
and unification have not changed.

( Ⅲ ) Following Through with Military Readiness against Taiwan

At the beginning of the 21[st] century, the PLA established “winning limited wars
under conditions of informatization” as a basis for its military preparations, and
focused on developing its Navy, Air Force and Second Artillery. In which the Air
Force’s new generation fighters were dispatched to southeast coastal bases to take part
in defense affairs, and were outfitted with long-range air defense missiles; the Navy

-----

**_The PLA continues to outfit its third generation fighters, air defense missiles and mid-_**
**_range ballistic missiles, using it to demonstrate its self-reliant defense technologies and_**

deployed long-range anti-ship missiles and new missile boats on the coasts of Fukien
and Guangdong; the Ground Force prioritized the Nanjing and Guangzhou military
regions for outfitting new long-range MLRS and amphibious assault vehicles. These
actions enhance the PLA’s firepower for suppressing our offshore islands and its
amphibious landing capabilities. Furthermore, the PLA uses garrison training and
exercises to verify the performance of its new equipment and capabilities of its forces.
In summary, the PLA has continued to follow through with its military readiness
against Taiwan, and is stepping up the development of armed services (forces) under
the guidance of its strategic goals for overall national security and defense and
military modernization. At present, the PLA is already capable of blockading Taiwan
and seizing our offshore islands.

中華民國壹百年

國防報告書


( Ⅳ ) Executing Multifaceted Military Missions

In order to successfully execute multifaceted military missions, the PRC’s military
diplomacy has changed towards “practicality.” Utilizing the diplomatic strategies
of large states, the PRC used its dissatisfaction of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan for the
high-profiled reestablishment of strategic cooperation with Russia, and went into
the vicinities of the U.S. in search of energy, while cozying up with anti-U.S. forces.
The PRC’s “earthquake diplomacy” served as a catalyst for the establishment of a
multinational joint disaster relief mechanism, and it initiated its MND press release
system to improve the PLA’s image. Furthermore, the PRC held joint counterterrorism exercises with numerous countries, and bilateral joint search and rescue
exercises in its surrounding sea areas in the Asia-Pacific, in hopes of effectively
increasing its influence on international affairs. The PRC emphasized that “military
operations other than war is an important way of using national military strength,”
and thus stepped up its counter-terrorism, stability safeguard, contingency response,
disaster relief and international peacekeeping operations, enhancing its international
influence by demonstrating that the PLA is capable of responding multiple security
threats and completing multifaceted military missions.

( Ⅴ ) Actively Absorbing Operational Concepts of Foreign Armed
Forces

The PLA gained a profound understanding of the importance of modernized warfare
from the Gulf War and Kosovo War, and is actively learning from battlefield
experiences and operational concepts of the U.S. Army. Furthermore, the PRC in
2010 for the first time sent Air Force fighters to Turkey’s “Anatolia” air force base
to participate in the “Anatolian Eagle” joint exercise, hoping to use the opportunity
of joint training of different fighters with the Turkey Air Force and gain related
experience. The PLA Air Force was invited to Pakistan in March 2011 to take part
in the joint air force exercise held for the 60[th] anniversary of the PRC and Pakistan
establishing diplomatic relations. Due to the fact that Pakistan has the same F-16 and
Mirage fighters as us, besides deepening military exchanges with Pakistan, the PLA
also used to opportunity to become familiar with characteristics of western fighters
and verify its counter measures, absorbing operational concepts of foreign armed
forces to enhance the combat capabilities of its own forces.

Part 1 Strategic Environment

Chapter 2 Security Challenges


67


-----

( Ⅵ ) Strengthening Uniform Peacetime and Wartime Protection

In response to the future trend of increasing war protection difficulty, the PLA is
actively strengthening and making overall plans for military-civilian joint protection,
and is devoted to the integration of force, local and defense mobilization protection
capabilities. The PLA has thus carried out joint logistics exercises and training
involving military transportation, maritime hygiene and air delivery, thereby gaining
military-civilian contingency response capabilities. Furthermore, the PLA established
large regional comprehensive protection bases, and signed joint protection agreements
with private enterprises for equipment, fuel and supplies. The PLA also implemented
social protection works and utilized the advantages of integrating military and civilian
for logistics protection. In addition, the PLA evaluates the professional competencies
of logistics protection personnel, and provides integrated combat and protection
training, so as to verify the protection performance of new logistics equipment.

Section 2 PRC Military Capabilities and
Threats

Based on plans for defense and military modernization in accordance with the “Three
Step” development strategy, the PRC not only hopes to become a regional military
power, but also plans to bring its military in-line with advanced countries, building
a modernized military with Chinese characteristics. Furthermore, besides actively
establishing contingency response capabilities against Taiwan, the PRC is picking up
the pace of “mechanization” and “informatization” developments, and developing an
integrated training mode for joint operations under conditions of informatization.

I. PRC Military Capabilities

In recent years, the PLA has attached importance to “counter-terrorism, crisis
response, disaster relief and international peacekeeping” to strengthen its capabilities
for “military operations other than war.” As for the PRC’s military build-up against
Taiwan, it is accelerating the establishment of “area-denial” capabilities, and
simultaneously implementing military modernization with an emphasis on joint
operations. The PRC’s military capabilities is analyzed below:

( Ⅰ ) Strengthening Integrated Joint Operations Capabilities

The PRC’s “Overall Plans for Joint Training” utilizes “theater of operations joint
training mechanisms” to implement training for a series of war operations and
military operations other than war that are interconnected, hoping that it will allow its
forces to gain joint operations capabilities.

1. Ground Operations Capabilities

Capabilities of integrated air-and-ground operations, long distance
cross-region mobility, rapid assault, landing and special operations have
been strengthened in coordination with the transition from “regional
defense” to “global mobility.” Besides accelerating “mechanization” and
“informatization” developments, the PRC is actively strengthening its


Part 1 Strategic Environment

Chapter 2 Security Challenges


69


-----

joint landing operation capabilities, and not years ago held an exercise
that simulated joint operations for crossing the Taiwan Strait and landing,
verifying its scenario of the full invasion of Taiwan. In addition, the PLA
assembled forces from several military regions for long distance crossregion mobility live exercises in 2009 and 2010; railways, highways and
civilian aircrafts were used as a means for transportation in the exercises;
the exercises showed that the transition to “global mobility” had already
obtained preliminary results.

2. Sea Control Operations Capabilities

In coordination with the transition from “offshore defense” to “open water
defense,” besides expanding the depth of its offshore defense strategy
and enhancing amphibious delivery capabilities, the PRC has increased
the frequency of cross-region open water trainings implemented by its
fleets. The PRC is also engaged in the construction of aircraft carriers,
has commenced test flights of carrier-based aircrafts, and is devoted to
the construction of large battleships and submarines, showing its ambition
towards its “open water defense” strategy. Also, the PRC is actively
enhancing it comprehensive combat and nuclear counter strike capabilities
with an emphasis on the continued building of nuclear submarines and
silent conventional submarines, and the development of submarine-launched
intercontinental range ballistic missiles and long-range anti-ship missiles.
It is apparent that the PLA’s will become increasingly capable of nuclear
counter strike, area-denial, Taiwan Strait control and blockade operations.

3. Counter Air Operations Capabilities

Capabilities for reconnaissance and early warning, joint air control,
air defense, anti-missile and long distance strategic delivery have been
strengthened in coordination with the transition from “homeland air
defense” to “balanced offense and defense.” In which the PLA’s number
of third generation fighters has significantly increased, and most are
already capable of aerial refueling and can carry newly developed airlaunched cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles, enabling the PLA to
gain air superiority over the sea area west of the first island chain.
Furthermore, the PLA has been actively developing “fourth generation”
fighters in recent years, striving to match the performance of fighters
built by the U.S.; the PLA planned to outfit small quantities of the fourth
generation fighter. Even though evaluations indicate that it is possible the


70


-----

中華民國壹百年

國防報告書

“fourth generation” fighter will not be completed according to schedule,
the PRC’s technological capabilities are enough to affect the balance of
military strength in the Asia-Pacific.

4. Second Artillery Strike Capabilities

Under the guidance to “balance nuclear and conventional,” the PLA has
continued the development of independently targetable intercontinental
range ballistic missiles, strengthened strategic nuclear intimidation,
nuclear counter strike and conventional precision strike capabilities,
and deployed anti-ship middle range ballistic missiles (DF-21D guided
missile), which is a weapon developed to strike aircraft carriers; a small
quantity of the missiles were produced and deployed in 2010, increasing
the difficulty of military maneuvers in the region for the U.S. Army. The
PRC’s training is based on professional skills and supporting measures,
and aims to verify plans for operations against Taiwan; forces take turns
in receiving training, and engage in joint live exercises together with the
Air Force’s aviation and air defense forces, thereby strengthening joint
fire support strikes.

5. Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Capabilities

Among the various models of satellites the PRC has deployed, some possess
high resolution and all weather surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities,
while have significantly enhance early warning, command and control,
battlefield reconnaissance, aircraft and ship navigation, communication
security and weapons precision strike capabilities. Furthermore, the PLA has
absorbed operational concepts of foreign armed forces, and applied beyond
visual range radars in surveillance and reconnaissance equipment, such as
aerial warning aircrafts and unmanned reconnaissance aircrafts. The PLA
is now capable of surveillance and reconnaissance over the western Pacific,
eastern Taiwan, and sea areas surrounding the Okinawa islands, satisfying
its requirements on battlefield intelligence, and allowing it to carry out
military command and control, intelligence transmission and intelligence
gathering undetected.

6. Information and Electronic Warfare Capabilities

The PLA currently has completed a variety of electronic disruption bases
and deployed various disruption devices, and Air Force and Navy combat


Part 1 Strategic Environment

Chapter 2 Security Challenges


71


-----

platforms are also gradually gaining electronic warfare capabilities.
Determining based on the PRC’s current deployments and performance
of electronic warfare soft/hard kill equipment, the PRC is capable of
performing electromagnetic parameter search and soft and hard kill
missions. In addition, the PRC has incorporated the private sector’s
immense capabilities for information network warfare. This enables the PRC
to employ hackers to infiltrate political, military and research institutions
of other states, and effectively execute network warfare missions, thereby
destroying the target area’s political, economic and psychological defenses.
The PRC will continue to develop new weapon concepts, such as EMP, with
an emphasis on offensive applications during wartime, which will aid the
PRC’s efforts to seize “electromagnetic control” over the battlefield.

( Ⅱ ) Actively Strengthening Managing Strategies for the South
China Sea

After the improvement of cross-strait relations, although the Taiwan Strait remains
a strategic focus, the PRC has shifted its attention to the South China Sea. Between
2008 and 2010, the PRC sequentially strengthened exercises and maritime rights
safeguard operations in the South China Sea. In March 2010, the PRC declared that
the South China Sea was a “core interest” that concerned its territorial integrity,
showing how much it valued islands and resources in the area. The PRC is actively
managing the South China Sea, strengthening its air superiority in the direction,
expanding open water contingency response forces, and building its first carrier strike
group, thereby intimidating countries surrounding the South China Sea, and reducing
or eliminating the U.S. Army’s influence on the area.

( Ⅲ ) Accumulating Area-Denial Capabilities

In view of the U.S. Army’s active joint air and sea operation exercises recently, and
its adjustment of force deployment in the Asia-Pacific, moving its forces forward for
capability preservation, the PLA has thus been actively developing “anti-access/areadenial” capabilities in recent years to enhance the effectiveness of its intimidation
strategy. As of 2010 the PLA Air Force and Navy possess joint fire support strike
capabilities to penetrate the first island chain, forcing the U.S. and other states in the

region to face the fact of the PRC’s military expansion. Furthermore, although the
quantity of new equipment outfitted by the PLA in 2010 was relatively less than past
years, it is the likely result of immense defense funding invested in the development
and production of long-range delivery equipment for its armed forces and second
artillery. In the future, as this equipment is developed and outfitted, it will help the
PLA accumulate area-denial capabilities.

In a wider perspective, the PLA’s “anti-access” capabilities can be applied in all
“area-denial” operations, in which the greatest threat is posed by ballistic missiles
directly crippling enemy bases. Even now the PLA is further enhancing its “antiaccess” and “area-denial” capabilities, reinforcing its intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance system, deploying anti-ship ballistic missiles and advanced aircrafts
and ships, developing air- and submarine-launched precision strike weapons, and
extending its power projection via live exercises, thereby deterring foreign armed
forces from interfering with the situation in the Taiwan Strait.

( Ⅳ ) Enhancing Capabilities to Carry Out “Military Operations
Other Than War”

The PRC announced the “Contingency Plan for Military Reponses to Sudden
Incidents” in November 2006, and stipulated that the PLA and Armed Police must
participate in flood, earthquake, snow, typhoon and fire disaster relief according to
the needs of local governments. In addition, the PLA has been actively taking part
in international security cooperation and military exchanges in recent years, so as to
enhance its capability to respond to multiple security threats and execute multifaceted
military missions, thereby increasing its influence in the international society.

At present, in order to strengthen its military soft power and influence, the PLA
is devoted to the application of military operations other than war, and is taking
part in domestic disaster relief and epidemic prevention activities, so as to elevate
the unification and inspiration of its forces. The PLA is also participating in
multinational joint military exercises and peacekeeping operations, showing its power
of intimidation and further improving its image. Since the PRC’s involvement in
peacekeeping operations of the UN, it has carried out a number of military operations
related to unconventional security issues, including international peacekeeping,

counter terrorism, convoy missions, disaster relief and humanitarian assistance. In
recent years, the PRC has actively performed joint military exercises of “military
operations other than war” for a number of countries, hoping to shape an international
image and make its military intentions more transparent.

( Ⅴ ) Strengthening “Three Warfare” Capabilities against Taiwan

The PLA began actively waging non-military “three warfares” (public opinion
warfare, psychological warfare and legal warfare) against Taiwan in December 2003,
and formally included them in the “Regulations for the CPLA on Political Work.”
Since 2008 the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have engaged in economic and cultural
exchanges, and although the tense atmosphere has somewhat relaxed, the PRC is
still actively using its military for intimidation and making preparations for invasion.
Besides incorporating the “three warfares” as a part of military school education and
force exercises, the PRC has also mobilized local governments and scientific research
institutions to engage in the three warfares as well. The PRC attempts to disunite
the ROC with talks of “peace,” to intimidate and pressure the ROC with talks of
“war,” hoping to achieve “wage small wars and win big victories” and “win without
fighting.”

At the present stage the PLA emphasizes intangible combat capability as an
important means for utilizing its soft power; therefore, the “three warfares” is a
means for bringing the PLA’s military soft power into full play. In recent years,
besides strengthening infrastructure for the “three warfares,” the PLA is also
actively building a psychological trial force, establishing training research institutes,
and training dedicated psychological warfare officers; the PRC also established a
Ministry of Defense news spokesperson mechanism, which will serve to breakdown
psychological defenses and affect public opinion when infiltrating the enemy. In
addition, seeing that the “three warfares” are among main operations of local wars,
the PRC is gradually strengthening “three warfares” capabilities at each stage for
future military confrontations. The PRC’s current attitude towards Taiwan still
stresses that “non-peaceful measures will be adopted to resolve the Taiwan issue
when Taiwan’s separation inclination is apparent,” showing that its strategic concept
is still “to be softer when the enemy is soft and to be tougher when the enemy is
tough.”

( Ⅵ ) Actively Strengthening Military Soft Power

1. Promoting Military Science Research and Exchanges

The PRC has established numerous “Confucius Institutes” in foreign
countries in recent years to promote the Chinese culture, hoping to display
its soft power via the promotion of “Chinese Studies.” The PLA also
uses China’s ancient military science research as an important means for
promoting its military soft power. The most significant trend is the study and
application of The Art of War in countries around the world, for which many
international seminars were held, greatly promoting the military concept of
Sun Tzu. The PRC on one hand utilizes the attraction of the cultural values
of The Art of War, and on the other hand emphasizes the concept of “being
cautious in war” to endorse its “peaceful rise.”

2. Stepping up Military Diplomacy and Publicity

The PRC has improved its image in recent years via military cooperation
and propaganda, increasing its influence, appeal and ability to intimidate;
these are important contents of military soft power. Furthermore, the PRC
has taken part in a number of international military control negotiations,
including the “Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty,” “Chemical
Weapons Convention,” “Biological Weapons Convention” and “Convention
on Certain Conventional Weapons,” and has also sent peacekeeping
personnel to take part in UN peacekeeping operations, actively participating
in bilateral or multilateral defense negotiations; the PRC has also set up
military hotlines with Russia, the U.S., Japan and South Korea. Since 2000,
the PRC has invited other countries to observe its military exercises and
vice versa, and has continuously increased the number of joint military
exercise with foreign armed forces, totaling to over 70 exercises up to date;
through these exercises the PRC hopes to achieve assimilation, absorption
and intimidation.

3. Vitalizing Military Diplomacy Rivalry

The PRC’s relations with Western and surrounding countries have been
tense in recent years due to sensitive issues, such as U.S. arms sales to


76

中華民國壹百年

國防報告書

Taiwan, the Tianan Ship incident, invitations to Dalai Lama and territorial
disputes (e.g. Diaoyutai Islands, South China Sea, and borderline of China
and India), and its space for military exchanges has shrunk as a result.
Therefore, besides relying on its political and economic strength to mend its
relations of other countries, the PRC is using diverse military exchanges, e.g.
joint military exercises, defense affairs negotiation, arms sales (support) and
navy ship visits, to improve its relations with third world countries in Asia,
Africa and Latin America, thereby increasing its regional influence to match
the U.S. strategy of containment in the Asia-Pacific.

II. Military Threat of the PRC to Taiwan

With regard to the PRC’s policy towards Taiwan, although evaluations of the security
situation show that cross-strait relations are gradually improving, the PRC still
emphasizes that “Taiwan Independence” separatist forces are a threat to its territorial
sovereignty and security, and has objected to the continued U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.
Up to date the PRC has not showed military good will towards Taiwan, nor has it
adjusted its concepts of intimidation and unification.

( Ⅰ ) Opinions of High Ranking Officials Regarding Taiwan

Cross-strait relations have gradually relaxed since 2008, during which both sides
signed the three major links, tourism and financial cooperation agreements. The
Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) signed on June 29[th], 2010
benefits the normalization of cross-strait economic exchanges and trade; however, its
long-term effects on our participation in regional economic integration will require
further evaluation. From a military perspective, the PRC’s threat to Taiwan remains
unabated, and it is strengthening its military readiness for possible contingencies
that might arise in the Taiwan Strait, hoping to rapidly convert its defense forces into
offensive forces targeting Taiwan. This shows that the PRC will take even tougher
actions towards changes in the Taiwan Strait.

( Ⅱ ) Military Readiness of the PRC against Taiwan

Over the past year the PLA’s exercises and training continues to be directed against
Taiwan; combat preparations are required to be completed according to its timetable,


Part 1 Strategic Environment

Chapter 2 Security Challenges

and then verified of its effectiveness in offensive operations against Taiwan.
Determining based on the PLA’s current capabilities, training and exercise conditions
and military action plans targeting Taiwan, the PLA now has emergency mobilization
and combat capabilities against Taiwan, in addition to its large scale joint fire support
strike capabilities. Moreover, the continuous rise of the PLA’s capabilities in both
quality and quantity will enable it to elevate the intensity of its military operations
and mobility for making adjustments to force deployment, showing that the PRC’s
determination to use military force against Taiwan and its military threat has not
changed.

( Ⅲ ) Characteristics of the PRC’s Offensive Operations against
Taiwan

In terms of the PRC’s military capabilities, its current primary threats against Taiwan
are still military intimidation and partial blockades. However, in terms of “military
modernization, strategic ideology, force structure and deployment, and weapons
research and development,” the PRC now possesses “diverse air-and-ground
reconnaissance and surveillance methods, versatile fire support opposite Taiwan, and
multiple intimidation options against Taiwan,” which can be summarized as follows:

1. Diverse Air-and-Ground Reconnaissance and Surveillance Methods

Besides accelerating the establishment of infrastructure for various
armed forces, the PLA is also actively incorporating military, civilian
and international cooperation to gradually establish various intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance platforms. With regard to the PRC’s overall
reconnaissance and surveillance force buildup and deployment, its diverse
reconnaissance and surveillance methods allow it to cover air and ground
throughout the entire eastern Asia. This capability enables the PRC to use
military means to resolve the Taiwan Strait issue and territorial disputes
over the South China Sea, posing a threat to regional security and stability,
and thus increasing the difficulty for our defense preparations and readiness
missions to be executed undetected.


78

中華民國壹百年

國防報告書


2. Versatile Firepower opposite Taiwan

The PLA’s existing land attack weapons include various models of tactical
ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, air-to-ground precision missiles, and
guided bombs. In particular, PRC tactical ballistic missiles can now carry
warheads that can attack multiple targets. There are also air launched antiradiation missiles and unmanned attack vehicles capable of attacking
command, control, and radar systems on the ground within the PRC’s
arsenal of air-launched precision missiles. The PRC possesses firepower
variety, large area coverage, and tactical versatility, all of which adds
difficulty to Taiwan’s defensive operations.

3. Multiple Intimidation Options against Taiwan

The PLA’s recent exercises and training still aim to strengthen its readiness
against Taiwan. The PLA formally added “Armed Police” to its array of
forces for operations against Taiwan in 2007; the Armed Police can rapidly
be converted into backup for contingency operations during wartime.
Determining based on training and exercise conditions and related military
preparations, the PLA now has multiple intimidation options against
Taiwan. Moreover, the continuous rise of the PLA’s capabilities will enable
it to elevate the intensity of its military operations and mobility for making
adjustments to force deployment.

( Ⅳ ) Possible Options for Offensive Operations against Taiwan

Based on the PLA’s timetable for military readiness against Taiwan, at the current
stage the PLA has large scale joint fire support strike and key sea area and air space
blockade capabilities, which could develop into joint military intimidation, joint
blockade operations, joint fire support strike, joint landing operations and area-denial
capabilities. The scope of joint blockade operations extends to the sea area west of
the first island chain; joint landing operations include seizing Penghu and limited
operations on Taiwan. Possible options are summarized below:

1. Joint Military Intimidation

The PRC may employ psychological warfare against ROC Armed Forces,

Part 1 Strategic Environment

Chapter 2 Security Challenges


79


-----

which may involve intensifying military activities, adjusting force
deployment and using the media to publicize military risks in the Taiwan
Strait, attempting to cause panic in Taiwan and lower the morale of our
military and civilians.

2. Joint Blockade Operations

The PLA may use its Air Force and Navy to set up partial blockades
targeting important ports in Taiwan and offshore islands, as well as external
transportation routes, so as to weaken the morale of our military and
civilians, sever our economic lifeline, deteriorate our living environment,
and force us to seek peace agreements.

3. Joint Fire Support Strike

The PLA may use its Second Artillery and air-launched land attack missiles
to attack our command system, political and economic centers and symbolic
targets. The PLA will then gradually escalate the situation by crippling
our air defense, sea control and counter strike systems, and seizing and
maintaining electromagnetic control, air control and sea control, thus
shattering our will to fight, forcing us to surrender, or creating a foundation
for subsequent strategic operations.

4. Joint Landing Operations

The PLA may combine its ground forces, navy, air force and second artillery
to launch a triphibian invasion of Taiwan in the sequence, preliminary
engagement, electromagnetic control operations, air superiority operations,
sea control operations and landing. The PRC will aim for a short battle
and quick victory before foreign forces can intervene, thus establishing a
political reality that will prevent further intervention.

5. Area-Denial

The scope of area-denial has been expanded to partial sea areas and air
space west of Guam, and is directed towards the U.S. and Japan.

6. Comprehensive Analysis

At present, the PRC is not yet fully equipped to launch a full scale invasion
of Taiwan as it still has insufficient amphibious transport equipment.
Therefore, it is more likely that the PRC will adopt military intimidation,
partial blockade (including seizing our offshore islands) and firepower strike
as measures for achieving its military readiness objectives for the current
stage. In the future, once the PLA is capable of invading Taiwan, or when
the need arises, it considers the direct invasion of Taiwan an option for
achieving its ultimate political goal.

( Ⅴ ) Comparison of Military Strength on the Two Sides of the
Taiwan Strait

The PLA’s three armed services (including the Second Artillery) has a total force of
some 2.3 million personnel; the ROC’s three armed services (no second artillery)
has a total force of some 270 thousand personnel; the PLA has roughly 10 times the
number of troops as the ROC Armed Forces. The PLA has an absolute advantage in
terms of ballistic missiles and submarines. Furthermore, superiority in ground forces,
navy and air force is also gradually tipping towards the PLA.

Using the 2010 defense budget of both sides for comparison, the PRC’s defense
budget was roughly U.S.$78 billion, while the ROC’s defense budget was roughly
U.S.$9 billion, which appears to be a difference of over 8-fold. Yet, the PRC’s actual
military funding is somewhere between 2 to 3 times the figure it has disclosed.
Therefore, the actual difference in defense budgets on the two sides may reach up to
21-fold. The gap in terms of weapons and equipment is even wider, and should be
followed with great concern (a comparison of military strength on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait is shown in Table 2-2).

( Ⅵ ) Comprehensive Analysis of Threat to Taiwan

Although the risk of military conflict has subsided in recent years as cross-strait
relations improved, this development has benefitted the PRC’s defense and military
modernization and strengthened its military, which increases the threat to our national
security and impacts regional military balance; this is truly a risk to regional and our

national security. Provided that at the current stage the PLA has not renounced the use
of military force against Taiwan, the risk of cross-strait military conflicts still exists.
Moreover, the PLA has deployed over one thousand missiles along its southeast
coasts opposite Taiwan, established a network of air defense and anti-ship bases, and
continued to outfit long-range precision strike fighters and missile boats with stealth
capabilities. Furthermore, the PLA is sending navy ships to the western Pacific for

long-term voyage training, hoping to gradually improve the effectiveness of its joint
fire support strikes and strengthen its force delivery capabilities, using military force
to support its plans to overpower Taiwan.

In recent years, the PRC has boasted its contributions to the international society to
shape its image as a peacekeeper. From a strategic point of view, the PRC has switch
from a passive strategy of responding to matters of concern of the international
society, to actively manipulating international military control, disarmament and
proliferation prevention issues, attempting to play the role as a leader of the third
world and arbitrator of regional affairs. Furthermore, although the PRC agrees that
cross-strait relations have been improved, it remains discontent with developments
of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, and has continued to strengthen its military readiness
against Taiwan, this includes strengthening precision strike capabilities of the Second
Artillery, improving long distance target guidance and strike capabilities of the
Navy and Air Force, and refining exercises of the Ground Force for (controlling)
seizing nearby islands. It is apparent that the PRC’s concepts of “opposing Taiwan
independence and advancing the unity of China” and “using military force to advance
the unity of China” have not changed. In the light of this, we must continue to solidify
our force development and defense readiness, so as to meet the PRC’s military
challenge.

typhoons and landslides. Based on the concept of “active disaster relief,” the ROC
Armed Forces has adopted the approach of “preparing for disasters in advance,
deploying troops with an eye to disaster preparedness, and ensuring readiness for
rescue operations” for responding to the threat of major natural disasters to national
security. In view of the strong earthquake that occurred in Japan on March 11[th], 2011,
which became a “complex” disaster as it caused a tsunami that resulted in a nuclear
disaster, the ROC Armed Forces is strengthening its contingency response capabilities
to meet new challenges. Our nation is engaged in frequent international exchanges,
and is thus at risk of foreign infectious diseases causing an epidemic in our borders.
In the light of this, the ROC Armed Forces assists with epidemic prevention in
coordination with the government’s health policy and medical system, so as to
prevent epidemic situations from further escalating.

In addition, the ROC is a nation highly dependent on imports for energy and food.
Therefore, food and energy security is a matter of the nation’s overall development.
With global raw material prices trending upwards, we must continue to place
emphasis on the source, transportation, import and storage of energy and food; this
will allow us to prevent inadequate supply for people’s livelihood and economic
development from becoming a threat to our national security. Furthermore, the
gradual decrease in draft age men as a result of the rapid outflow of talents and trend
of aging population is also a matter of national security, and also a secret worry of our
national defense.

The above describes challenges to our national security. The ROC Armed Forces
must implement defense transformation and build a solid defense force under the
policy to “prevent war” and to “prepare for war but not provoke war,” so that it may
back cross-strait peaceful and positive interaction. At the same time, the Armed
Forces must serve as a “guardian of national security” and remain aware that “to
bring peace it must first be capable of war,” establishing innovative and asymmetrical
military deterrence capabilities, reinforcing disaster relief mechanisms, and actively
handling major threats in our exclusive economic zone, including ground, air,
marine, submarine, electromagnetic spectrum and network. The Armed Forces will
thus become a contributor to peace and stability of the western Pacific, ensuring the
stability of the Asia-Pacific and the continued prosperous development of the global
economy.

Section 3 ROC Security Challenges and
Responses

Our efforts to maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait and regional security and stability
meet the expectations of people’s on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, as well as the
international society. With the government endeavoring to improve cross-strait
relations in recent years, the once tense atmosphere has greatly relaxed after the
growingly frequent exchanges and contact, and the possibility of an armed conflict
has been significantly reduced. In another aspect, unconventional security issues, such
as climate anomalies and major natural disasters, infectious diseases, food and energy
security, and the trend of aging population, are also major threats and challenges that
directly affect national security.

In the future, the ROC Armed Forces must be capable of executing conventional
and unconventional military operations, and it must face integrated, complicated
and versatile challenges to national security, if it is to protect homeland security and
ensure our nation’s survival and sustainable development.

I. Changes in the Regional Security Situation –
Actively Take Part in Security Cooperation

Most countries in the Asia-Pacific prioritize economic development, and thus the
region is currently actively undergoing economic integration. Conflict and war are
considered to be destructive actions, for this reason the strategic environment of the
Asia-Pacific is relatively peaceful and stable. The purpose of our force development
and readiness is to protect our national security. We will not provoke or initiate any
attacks, and avoid military conflict by participating in regional security cooperation,
jointly maintaining a peaceful and stable development environment.

Yet, to this day the PRC refuses to renounce the use of military force against Taiwan,
and has been actively developing intimidation and long-range precision strike
capabilities in recent years, including anti-satellite weapons, stealth (unmanned)
fighters, aircraft carriers, guided missiles, submarines, and large sea and air delivery

carriers. These capabilities focus on “anti-access” and “area-denial” and are far
beyond that required for mere self-defense, and have therefore affected the military
balance in the Asia-Pacific, becoming the main variable of regional stability.
Additionally, conflicts on the Korean Peninsula have also become a major threat to
regional security.

Based on the principles of preventing war, defending democracy and liberty, and
promoting long-term peace in the Asia-Pacific, we must continue to expand the
targets, mechanisms and channels of security exchanges and establish security
cooperation relationships with other countries in the region; for example, carrying
out joint search and rescue missions, humanitarian assistance and preventing the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, so as to jointly maintain regional
stability and peace.

II. Changes in the security environment of the
Taiwan Strait – Make corresponding strategy
adjustments

The current government has endeavored to improve cross-strait relations, and
has continued to expand economic and cultural exchanges. On June 29[th], 2010,
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait signed the “Economic Cooperation Framework
Agreement,” symbolizing the development of cross-strait interactions towards
becoming more substantial and mutually beneficial. This has resulted in a subtle
change in the security environment of the Taiwan Strait.

Even though the cross-strait security situation has become more relaxed, the PRC
continues to implement military modernization, and is actively engaged in force
deployment, development and readiness. In PRC’s white paper on national defense
issued in March 2011, the PRC indicated that its peaceful rise does not pose as a
threat to the world. The world was not convinced.

As the PRC’s comprehensive national strength and military strength continue to
increase, the ROC Armed Forces maintains a solid defense force in order to establish
even longer peace in the Taiwan Strait. In response to current developments and

國防報告書

following the principle of “deepening thoughts of peace and strengthening selfdefense capabilities,” the ROC Armed Forces applies the concept of “asymmetry”
in its development of “resolute defense and credible deterrence” capabilities, which
enable it to defend our territory and protect our national security.

III. Territorial disputes in vicinities – Resolutely
defend territorial sovereignty and maritime
interests

Building a solid defense force to ensure national territorial security and protect
national interests is the fundamental mission of the ROC Armed Forces. We are
currently involved in many disputes over maritime rights with our neighboring
countries as a result of overlapping economic zones, including fishing rights in our
exclusive economic zone, oceanographic survey of controversial sea areas, and
maritime affairs or territorial sovereignty issues deriving from such areas.

Pursuant to the “United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea” and customary
international law, we enjoy all lawful rights of our territorial sea and exclusive
economic zone. The Diaoyutai Islands, Nansha Islands, Xisha Islands, Zhongsha
Islands and Dongsha Islands and their surrounding sea areas are our inherent territory;
the sovereignty of these islands belongs to the ROC and is undisputable; any state
that claims right or occupies the abovementioned islands for any reasons shall be void
in law.

Borderlines of overlapping sea areas with neighboring countries will be drawn in
the form of an agreement in accordance with international law. Before an agreement
is reached, our government hopes that the parties within the region will uphold the
principles of maintaining regional maritime order, and jointly protect regional peace,
stability and development, practically improving positive interactions within the
region based on “joint development and resource sharing.” Based on its mission to
protect national security bestowed upon it by the ROC Constitution, the ROC Armed
Forces will abide by government policy, resolutely protect our territorial sovereignty,
and thereby ensure our national interests.

IV. Developments in the trend of globalization –
Respond to unconventional security threats

Continued development of the trend of globalization has deepened the
interdependence between countries around the world. The rising importance of
unconventional security issues puts government administration and governance
capabilities to the test. Unconventional security threats that we face include climate
anomalies and major natural disasters, infectious diseases, food and energy security
and the trend of aging population.

The ROC is threatened by a number of natural disasters, including earthquakes,
typhoons and landslides. Based on the concept of “active disaster relief,” the ROC
Armed Forces has adopted the approach of “preparing for disasters in advance,
deploying troops with an eye to disaster preparedness, and ensuring readiness for
rescue operations” for responding to the threat of major natural disasters to national
security. In view of the strong earthquake that occurred in Japan on March 11[th],
2011, which became a “complex” disaster as it caused a tsunami that resulted in a
nuclear disaster, the ROC Armed Forces is strengthening its contingency response
capabilities to meet new challenges. Our nation is engaged in frequent international
exchanges, and is thus at risk of foreign infectious diseases causing an epidemic
in our borders. In the light of this, the ROC Armed Forces assists with epidemic
prevention in coordination with the government’s health policy and medical system,
so as to prevent epidemic situations from further escalating.

In addition, the ROC is a nation highly dependent on imports for energy and food.
Therefore, food and energy security is a matter of the nation’s overall development.
With global raw material prices trending upwards, we must continue to place
emphasis on the source, transportation, import and storage of energy and food; this
will allow us to prevent inadequate supply for people’s livelihood and economic
development from becoming a threat to our national security. Furthermore, the
gradual decrease in draft age men as a result of the rapid outflow of talents and trend
of aging population is also a matter of national security, and also a secret worry of our
national defense.

National Defense Transformation

ational defense transformation is a continuous ongoing


process. The ROC Armed Forces hopes that the active

engagement of overall defense strength will allow it to respond to
developments of domestic and foreign situations, and thus fulfill
its missions. The scope of transformation is not limited to the
tangible, such as armaments upgrade, organizational streamlining,
combat training intensification and military theory research, but
also includes the intangible, such as organizational culture reform,
improvement of management systems and development of concepts
and perspectives. The Armed Forces hopes to strengthen the
momentum for transformation by adopting more flexible thinking
patterns and ridding itself of old burdens and habitual thinking.
Defense reformation and transformation is carried out based on
concepts of innovation and asymmetry, actively procuring and
upgrading weaponry and equipment to enhance joint operations
capabilities. Furthermore, the Armed Forces has completed force
restructuring plans for the “Jingtsui Program” and planning for
voluntarism, and will take on an even more practical attitude as
it strives for excellence, thereby yielding better results of force
development and readiness as it continues to implement defense
transformation tasks, effectively enhancing the performance of
defense organizations and ensuring the Armed Forces’ capabilities.

will continue to solidify its capabilities and strengthen its readiness,

“resolute defense and credible deterrence.” This will prevent any
military action against our country from being easily made, thereby
maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait and regional stability. In
addition, countries around the world are widely taking unconventional
safety issues very seriously, especially large natural disasters, which
pose the greatest threat to people’s lives and assets. Therefore,
disaster prevention and relief has been included as one of the Armed
Forces main missions. To achieve this mission the Armed Forces will
implement force development based on the principle of “disaster relief
during peacetime and combat during wartime,” and cooperate with
local governments in performing periodic exercises to enhance the
nation’s overall disaster relief capabilities

Section 1 Axes of National Defense Policy

In accordance with the President’s instructions to ensure national security by setting
up three defense lines – “institutionalized cross-Strait reconsciliation,” “increase
Taiwan’s contribution to international development” and “integrate national defense
with diplomacy,” the Ministry of National Defense is building up a “Hard ROC”
defense force, and using it as a basis for developing defense strategies and military
strategies, as well as planning defense transformation and development directions
of future capabilities. Since national defense is all-out defense, the implementation
of policy, such as voluntarism and military procurements, must gain recognition and
support from the people. Therefore, the ROC Armed Forces must dwell in the depths
of society and interact with the people, building an all-out defense consensus through
diverse contact with the people, which will benefit future force development and
readiness. At present, actual implementation aims to realize 7 policy axes – “Building
an Elite Armed Forces,” “Promoting Voluntarism,” “Reshaping Intangible Combat
Capability,” “Refining the Armaments Mechanism,” “Reinforcing Cooperation with
Friendly Countries and Allies,” “Strengthening Disaster Prevention and Relief” and
“Improving Care for Servicemen.”

I. Build an Elite Armed Forces

( Ⅰ ) Continue Implementing Defense Transformation in
Response to Security Threats and Challenges

Developments of military technology and changes of warfare in the information era
have continued to drive transformation and reformation of the ROC Armed Forces.
Based on forward-looking plans and reformation directions of the “Quadrennial
Defense Review” and concepts of “combat, equipment, arrangement and training,”
the Armed Forces has continued to procure new armaments and develop information
and electronic warfare, missile defense systems, joint counter air, joint sea control,
joint ground defense and asymmetrical capabilities using the limited defense
resources. Furthermore, the Armed Forces has reviewed its force scale and force
structure to make it more reasonable. Following the guidance of a defensive strategy,
an overall defense force that cannot be “intimidated, seized, devoured or crushed”
will be established to achieve “war prevention” and ensure national security.

( Ⅱ ) Improve Defense Organization Adjustments, Strengthen
Overall Defense Capabilities

In coordination with the timetable for government organization restructuring and
subsequent force structure adjustments, the MND plans to implement the “Jingtsui
Program” from 2011 to 2014. The program gives consideration to future warfare,
enemy situation and threats and the nation’s overall resource distribution, as well
as “military strategy,” “national financial resources and policy guidance” and
“voluntarism,” finding a balance between “combat requirements” and “financial
capabilities.” The program gathers defense resources together and utilizes them
to “prevent the enemy from landing and establishing lodgment”; on this basis the
program prioritizes the streamlining of high level command organizations to establish
a “small but superb, strong and smart” defense force.

II. Promote Voluntarism

( Ⅰ ) Extensive Recruitment of Excellent Talents to Accumulate
Defense Potential

Human resources are critical to the constitution of military organizations, and a key
factor to the success of force buildup. Only by continuously recruiting excellent
talents and accumulating human resources can the Armed Forces develop into a
professional, systemized and elite force that is consistent with military strategy plans
and force structure requirements. The Armed Forces consistently implements “strict
evaluation and strict elimination” of personnel, and hopes to drive talent cultivation
and sustainable development of human resources via law amendments, implementing
voluntarism, refining military education, cultivating civilian defense officials and
military-civilian cooperation, thereby consolidating defense capabilities and further
ensuring national survival and development, as well as the people’s safety and
welfare.

( Ⅱ ) Promotion of Transforming the Military Service System to
Enhance the Armed Forces’ Capabilities

Changes in the social environment, sequential reduction of the compulsory military
service period, and growingly frequent recruitment and discharge of servicemen, have
made it difficult for forces to accumulate experience and training results. Moreover,
low birth rates, aging population and decreasing ratio of the able-bodied population


Part 2 National Defense Transformationt

Chapter 3 National Defense Policy


95


-----

have resulted in the number of draft age men gradually becoming insufficient, making
it more and more difficult to maintain the current force scale, as well as a system
that employs both conscription and voluntarism. Therefore, the ROC’s military
service system will be gradually transformed from “conscription and voluntarism”
to “voluntarism,” recruiting highly competent talents to serve longer periods in
the military, thus establishing a professional, highly competent all-volunteer force
to further solidify defense capabilities. A practical plan for voluntarism will be
formulated in coordination with defense financial resources to effectively enhance
the Armed Forces’ capabilities, and complementary plans will be completed as well
to maintain flexibility; execution and verification periods will be suitably adjusted to
achieve a sustainable voluntarism policy.

III. Reshape Intangible Combat Capability

( Ⅰ ) Inherit Proper Military Discipline, Protect the Safety of
Forces

Based on the policy objectives of “solidifying national identification, realizing
nationalization of the military, shaping proper military discipline, rectification
of forces’ conduct, implementing military affairs reform, nurturing servicemen’s
morality, and building servicemen’s sense of honor,” the Armed Forces is dedicated
to passing down proper military discipline and shaping role models. Simultaneously,
measures that have been adopted to ensure the integrity of forces and enhancement
of their capabilities include establishing objective management and execution
methods, improving military discipline and safety assessment and risk management,
implementing supervision and inspection, expanding complaint consultation services,
utilizing early warning and precaution functions, and lowering security threats; these
measures aim to win people’s support and respect for the Armed Forces.

( Ⅱ ) Encourage Military Ethics, Defend the Armed Forces’ Honor

“Wisdom, faith, benevolence, courage and severity” are the military ethics of the
ROC Armed Forces. In order to strengthen servicemen’s military ethics, the MND
uses gatherings in school education, new recruit education, troops education and
reserve education for propaganda to help servicemen understand the contents
of military ethics. This fosters the spirit of “the wise are free from perplexities,
those with faith do not have second thoughts, the benevolent have no worries, the


96

中華民國壹百年

國防報告書

courageous have no fear and the severe are not selfish,” molding the Armed Forces
into a combat force with belief, ethics and skills, that is devoted to its operational
duties, and will fulfill its responsibility to defend our territory. In addition, to
encourage integrity and loyalty among cadres, the MND will continue to deepen
its education in various aspects, including “deepening basic education,” “refining
troops education,” “strengthening life education,” “promoting humanistic education,”
“implementing moral conduct assessment” and “cultivating cadre capacity,” in hopes
of changing and influencing servicemen unobtrusively and imperceptibly.

IV. Refine the Armaments Mechanism

( Ⅰ ) Formulate Armaments Technology Research Strategies,
Enhance Development of Defense Technologies

Defense infrastructure should be in a beneficial circulation with people’s livelihood
and the economy in order for developments of defense technologies and civilian
technologies to complement one another, and thus drive economic development and
further achieve self-reliant national defense. At the same time, to achieve autonomous
national defense and enhance the competitiveness of domestic industries, the Chung
Shan Institute of Science and Technology (CSIST), Armaments Bureau has directed
its efforts towards becoming an “administrative institution,” aiming to establish a
defense technology team with international competitiveness. The CSIST gives its
full support to the research and development of defense technologies via corporate
management concepts, flexible personnel adjustment, and enhancing the innovation
capability and cost effectiveness of its organization, and vitalizes the domestic
economy via promoting dual-use technology sharing, stably developing towards
“enhancing defense technology capabilities, establishing self-reliant national defense
industries, and expanding dual-use technologies”; the CSIST has integrated scientific
research capabilities nationwide and established a dual-use technology system to
accumulate abundant research and development capabilities.

( Ⅱ ) Integrate Defense Resources, Establish Self-Reliant National
Defense Capabilities

In coordination with the Executive Yuan’s policy guidance to “revitalize the economy
and expand domestic demand,” the Armed Forces will gradually outsource armaments
development, manufacturing and maintenance to the private sector, and develop


Part 2 National Defense Transformationt

Chapter 3 National Defense Policy


97


-----

dual-use technologies on the basis of defense technology development capabilities
and with an eye on industrial requirements. Besides effectively supporting domestic
industries, this will also achieve the win-win situation of self-reliant national defense
and driving economic development. In the future, the Armed Forces will expand
the scope of technology transfers, and allow military and civilian to complement
each other by cooperating with academic institutions. This will enhance research
and development and innovation of high-tech defense weapons, causing defense
industries to strike roots in the private sector and at the same time effectively integrate
resources with the Armed Forces; resource sharing will allow defense technology to
drive upgrade and transformation of private industries, creating a win-win situation
for national defense and people’s livelihood.

V. Reinforce Cooperation with Friendly Countries
and Allies

( Ⅰ ) Expand Military Exchanges and Interaction, Establish
Cooperation Platforms with Allies

Military exchanges and cooperation with different countries will continue to
be implemented in coordination with the nation’s overall foreign policy, jointly
establishing mechanisms for maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.
Based on the concepts of mutual assistance and mutual benefit, the width and depth
of military interactions will be increased via the invitation of high level officers, think
tank cooperation, military procurements, educational training, military assistance
and humanitarian aid. This will build good relationships with surrounding and allied
countries, as well as strong capabilities, achieving community “network expansion
and strong ally relations,” “increasing international visibility” and “maintaining peace
and stability in the Taiwan Strait and Asia-Pacific,” working together to prevent
regional conflict and reduce the possibility of war.

( Ⅱ ) Initiate Pragamatic Cooperation in International Multilateral
Affairs, Solidify Mutual Trust with Regional Allies

The trend of globalization has driven the formation of a global village. In response to
changes of times, besides continuing the implementation and participation in military
exchanges and cooperation with other countries, the Armed Forces is using the “second
track” to actively take part in a dignified, meaningful way in international seminars

and activities on security related issues held by domestic and foreign academia or
governments. This allows the Armed Forces to establish international exchange
dialogue, contribute its strengths, and utilize various channels to actively participate
in multilateral cooperation and non-government organizations. By extending bilateral
cooperation relationships to multilateral cooperation, the international society will
better know our defense policy and Taiwan’s importance to the security of the AsiaPacific area, increasing Taiwan’s international visibility and gaining vast recognition
from participating states. This will acquire the most benefits for the Armed Forces and
our nation, while we fulfill our mutual responsibility to maintain regional security,
stability and prosperity.

VI. Strengthen Disaster Prevention and Relief

( Ⅰ ) Enhance Disaster Prevention and Relief Capabilities, Refine
Disaster Prevention Mechanisms

Part 2 National Defense Transformationt

Chapter 3 National Defense Policy


99


-----

The Armed Forces is an important part of the nation’s crisis management mechanism,
and must be capable of executing conventional and unconventional military
operations in response to complex disasters caused by large natural disasters; concepts
of joint operations will serve as a basis for maximizing disaster relief capabilities.
Besides abiding by regulations of the “Disaster Prevention and Protection Act” and
“Regulations on the ROC Armed Forces’ Assistance in Disaster Relief,” the Armed
Forces will actively establish disaster prevention and relief capabilities with the
determination of “disaster relief is akin to fighting a battle.” When a major disaster
occurs, the Armed Forces will prepare for disasters in advance and deploy troops
with an eye to disaster preparedness based on the principle of not affecting defense
readiness, and fully engage in disaster relief missions. Furthermore, the Armed
Forces will continue to refine its disaster prevention and relief preparations, including
“revising administrative rules on disaster relief,” “establishing a disaster prevention
network,” “integrating the medical system,” “disaster prevention and relief training,”
“procuring disaster relief equipment” and “joint search and rescue exercises and
training,” thus solidifying the nation’s overall disaster prevention framework.

( Ⅱ ) Utilize Military and Civilian Disaster Prevention and Relief
Resources to Enhance Disaster Relief Performance

Disaster relief response mechanisms of the Armed Forces for each theater of
operations has been included as a part of overall operations of the Executive Yuan’s
“National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction”; each theater
of operations has an Emergency Operations Center that together completes the
disaster relief command system, allowing the rapid utilization of search and rescue
resources and immediate dispatch of relief forces into disaster areas, maximizing
the capabilities of minimum resources. In order to further expand disaster relief
capabilities, besides integrating search and rescue capabilities of government and
private sectors, the MND has established support protocols with local governments at
each level and social groups, tasking them with specific relief missions, so that when
a natural or man-made disaster occurs, aid can be truly and effectively provided to
central and local governments, achieving “first on the scene, effective resources and
efficient personnel.”

VII. Improve Care for Servicemen

( Ⅰ ) Implement Rights Protection, Strengthen Services for
Military Personnel

To protect the rights of servicemen, the Armed Forces has a fully developed
complaint system that serves as an important platform for military personnel to
protect their legal rights. The establishment of this complaint system and effective
handling of cases allows forces and their servicemen to identify with regulations and
management of life, work and training in a fair and reasonable environment, thus
allowing them to serve in their units with peace of mind and high morale. In addition,
the Armed Forces will continue to provide servicemen benefits and services and
care for their livelihood, which will effectively bond them together, strengthen their
loyalty and further unify forces.

( Ⅱ ) Encourage Lifelong Learning, Provide Assistance in Career
Planning

Servicemen are encouraged to practice “lifelong learning,” to use their time off
duty to absorb new knowledge and new technologies, so as to strengthen their own
competencies and boost the Armed Forces’ capability for innovation. Furthermore, in
coordination with the implementation of “voluntarism,” the Armed Forces has wellarranged personnel, budget, retirement and indemnity systems, provides servicemen
with good career planning, and provides even better professional skill training, so as
to attract outstanding talents to join the military, further develop their professional
skills in the military, and create maximum benefits.

national security interests, which directs the formulation and implementation of
military strategies. Guided by the defense policy to build a “Hard ROC” defense
force, objectives of the current “defense strategy” include “war prevention,”
“homeland defense,” “contingency response,” “conflict avoidance” and “regional
stability”. Measures to achieve the objectives are explained below:

I. War Prevention

( Ⅰ ) Build Up a “Hard ROC” Defense Force

Warfighting capability preservation and infrastructure protection will be enhanced
to strengthen sustainment after the enemy’s first strike. Joint operations capabilities
will be fully exploited and opportunities where we have an advantage in terms of
force, space and time will be utilized to annihilate enemies in sea areas and airspace.
In addition, reserve mobilization capabilities will be actively developed and all-out
defense will be enforced to effectively defend our territory.

( Ⅱ ) Establish “Credible Deterrence” Capabilities

Defensive countermeasures capabilities will continue to be enhanced, asymmetrical
warfare capabilities researched and developed, technological superiorities integrated,
self-reliant defense realized, and IT-driven suppression capabilities established. In
this way, means of “credible deterrence” will work to achieve the objective of “resolute
defense”.

( Ⅲ ) Establish Cross-Strait Military Confidence-Building
Mechanisms

Institutionalized cross-Strait negotiations have been implemented in an orderly
fashion according to overall policy planning of the nation at its current stage. These
negotiations are based on the ultimate guiding principles “national requirements,
public support, and congress supervision” and “putting Taiwan first for the benefit of

self-reliant defense realized, and IT-driven suppression capabilities established. In
this way, means of “credible deterrence” will work to achieve the objective of “resolute
defense”.

II. Homeland Defense

( Ⅰ ) Strengthen Quality of Forces

In response to the demand on competent manpower for high-tech warfare, as well as
changes in economic and social conditions, needs for conscripts will be sequentially
reduced each year while the number of volunteers will be increased so that the Armed
Forces will eventually become an “all volunteer force.” At the same time, various
complementary measures, such as statute amendments, manning, equipping and
organization adjustments, will be more comprehensive to effectively improve the
caliber of manpower and thereby build an elite Armed Forces.

( Ⅱ ) Enhance Early Warning Capabilities

In response to the rapid changes in international relations and the PRC’s
escalating military expansion, integration of existing intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance (ISR) capacity will be accelerated to enhances early warning systems.
Simultaneously, intelligence exchanges with neighboring and friendly nations will

be strengthened, and international military situation, possible threats and high-tech
weapon and equipment developments will be closely monitored to increase strategic
and tactical early warning capabilities.

( Ⅲ ) Strengthen Warfighting Capability Preservation

Measures for warfighting capability preservation will be strengthened to deal with the
threat of enemies launching sudden and high-intensity assaults. Operational functions
of all major systems will be backed up to avoid paralysis as a result of battle damage
during the early stages of operations, so as to prevent compromising of the forces’
subsequent operational capabilities. In addition, necessary support will be provided
to ensure continued operation of critical infrastructures, such as telecommunication,
transportation, energy, water supply and nuclear plants. Protection of critical
military infrastructures will be enhanced in order to maintain sustained operational
capabilities.

( Ⅳ ) Establish Highly Efficient Joint Operations Capabilities

Aiming to elevate the efficiency of joint operations, various operations capabilities
will be developed, and the joint operations command mechanism will be refined.
These will create relative advantages in warfighting capabilities and enable the
effective seize on operational opportunities to realize joint defense operations and
deter enemy incursions.

( Ⅴ ) Consolidate All-Out Defense Capabilities

framework established, and intelligence, timely warning, and early response
measures integrated so as defuse a crisis with effective prevention, management and
contingency response.

( Ⅱ ) Refine the Contingency Response Mechanism

When the nation faces threats of terrorist activities or sudden attacks from hidden
enemies, the joint operations command mechanism will immediately deploy rapid
response units to support competent authorities and local governments in quickly
quelling crises to accomplish the objectives of “preventing internal jolts and external
assaults.”

( Ⅲ ) Build Effective Disaster Relief and Response Troops

Under the existing organization and force structure, response units capable of
immediate response and disaster relief capabilities will be formed. The Armed Forces
will observe the guidance of “preparing for disasters in advance, deploying troops
with an eye to disaster preparedness, and ensuring readiness for rescue operations,”
and apply the principle of “safety, directness, and efficiency,” so that, immediately
after a major disaster takes place, the Armed Forces will proactively perform rescue
work and protect the people’s lives and assets.

IV. Conflict Avoidance

( Ⅰ ) Establish Military Conflict Avoidance Mechanisms

The joint operations command mechanism shall serve as the center of monitoring
in strictly dealing with activities in Taiwan’s surrounding sea areas and airspace,
and factors of dynamic and static security threats, so as to attain the goal of “crisis
prevention, situational control, emergency response, rapid intervention, and escalation
avoidance.”

( Ⅱ ) Abide by Conflict Avoidance Regulations

Forces at all levels will abide by the principle and combat readiness regulation of
“not provoking incidents, not escalating conflicts, and reducing hostile actions”

Participation in regional affairs will be active and security dialogues and exchange
will be increased. More responsibilities in global security issues such as upgrading
defense and security cooperation, preventing weapon proliferation, deterring terrorist
activities, and enhancing humanitarian assistance will also be assumed to make
positive contributions to the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region.

( Ⅱ ) Jointly Protect Regional Sea and Aerial Lines of
Communication

Systematic channels for strategic communication and security cooperation with
regional countries over security maintenance issues of sea and aerial lines of
communication will be established, so as to ensure freedom of movement of major
communication lines in the Asia Pacific region, and play a key role in facilitating
regional stability.

Section 3 Military Strategic Concepts

Military strategy is an aspect of national strategy. Its purpose is to win war, support
national strategy, and achieve national objectives. The ROC’s military strategy is
to establish military power based on basic concepts of the Constitution, which is to
“ensure the nation’s livelihood and development, safeguard the people’s security and
welfare, and protect freedom and democracy and the people’s rights.” Moreover,
it aims to independently and self-reliantly build up forces, with an emphasis on
fostering intangible combat capabilities, utilizing the strength of all-out defense to
defeat enemy and win war.

I. Military Strategic Concepts

The ROC Armed Forces has adopted “resolute defense and credible deterrence”
as its military strategic concept with consideration to the security environment in
surrounding regions, strategic postures of Taiwan and potential enemies and future
force developments, and based on the national defense strategy. At the same time,
the Armed Forces upholds the principle of “preventing war but not fearing war, and
preparing for war but not provoking war” when dealing with the enemy’s provocative
actions. Nonetheless, when war is inevitable, the three armed services will be
integrated and overall all-out defense capabilities will be combined to carry out
homeland defense and ensure national security.
In order to implement the military strategic concept of “resolute defense and credible
deterrence,” the ROC Armed Forces needs to effectively carry out the following
missions:

( Ⅰ ) Conduct Resolute Defense to Ensure the Security of
National Territories

When conducting defensive operations, Taiwan needs to be able to survive the
enemy’s first strike, averting decapitation, maneuvering forces to counter strikes, and
sustaining combat power so as to achieve the objectives of “strategic protraction and
tactical resolution.” Strategically, the Armed Forces will assume a defensive posture,
strive to gain time-critical defense in depth and create favorable situations. Tactically,

國防報告書


**_The ROC Armed Forces effectively executes resolute defense, credible deterrence, counter_**
**_blockade, joint interception and ground defense operations to ensure homeland security._**

the Armed Forces needs to fully exploit favorable conditions on “force, space,
and timing” and to utilize overall capabilities of all-out defense so as to annihilate
invading enemy forces and ensure homeland security.

( Ⅱ ) Conduct Credible Deterrence to Maintain Strong and
Reliable Warfighting Capabilities

The Armed Forces will effectively integrate the interoperability of weapon systems,
upgrade performance of joint operations, enhance defensive countermeasure
capabilities, and execute combat training and readiness operations. These efforts
will force the enemy to rationally calculate the costs and risks of invasion,
therebydeterring any hostile intention of launching an attack.

Part 2 National Defense Transformationt

Chapter 3 National Defense Policy


109


-----

( Ⅲ ) Counter Blockade to Maintain Sea and Aerial Lines of
Communication

Most of the ROC’s major livelihood and strategic supplies and materials are
imported. Thus, sea and aerial lines of communication are critical to our national
survival. In peacetime, security in the surrounding airspace and sea areas will be
maintained. In wartime, joint operations capabilities will be integrated to counter
the enemy’s blockading forces, open safe aerial and sea transportation routes and
maintain communications to the outside world, thereby maintaining capabilities for
subsequent operations.

( Ⅳ ) Conduct Interception Jointly to Retard Enemies from
Approaching our Territory

According to the guidelines of defense operations, after the enemy launches an
attack, the Armed Forces shall seize favorable conditions, concentrate firepower, and
precisely strike at the enemy’s strategic centers. Subsequently, based on developments
of the battlefield, the Armed Forces should focus on two key stages, namely “joint
interdiction operations” and “joint anchorage area attack,” the objective of which
is to stop and destroy the enemy’s amphibious vessels when they are crossing the
Taiwan Strait and in anchorage areas, which is when their warfighting capabilities are
relatively weak.

( Ⅴ ) Conduct Ground Defense to Prevent Enemies from Landing
and Establishing Lodgment

The ROC Armed Forces has constructed an in-depth defensive system by applying
overall capabilities of all-out defense. If the enemy attempts an amphibious landing
with its superior naval forces and air support, this system will be utilized to execute
multilayered interdictions to defeat the enemy’s landed and airborne troops before
the invading troops are secured, so as to achieve the objective of effective homeland
defense.

II. Future Requirements for Defense Operations

In order to successfully execute missions defined in the military strategy and
accommodate the conditions of battlefields in the Taiwan Strait, characteristics of
modern warfare, and developments in military technologies and weapon systems,
the Armed Forces’ readiness for future defense operations needs to follow the
development principles below:

( Ⅰ )Force planning, building and deployment must focus on the prevention of
the enemy’s surprise attack, decapitation, paralysis, or other asymmetrical
operations, so as to sequentially build a modernized defense force that meets
requirements of defense operations.

( Ⅱ )Warfighting capabilities of different armed services (branches), force structure,
command mechanisms, military doctrinal concepts, and campaign tactics and
techniques should continue to be integrated for joint operations, so that the
armed forces can multiply warfighting capabilities and create local battlefield
superiority.

( Ⅲ )All major weapon systems and platforms should acquire a higher level of
systematic links to reduce the time required for the “detection – processing
– decision – action” cycle. This aims for overall warfighting capabilities to
achieve effective and rapid command and control, real-time and uninterrupted
communication, and highly effective precision strike firepower.

( Ⅳ )Capabilities that can retard the enemy offense and compromise enemy
attempts to achieve quick victory should be planned and developed. This
will force the enemy to practically assess the cost of launching an invasion,
thereby reducing the possibility of the enemy resorting to military means.

( Ⅴ )Facing threats from the enemy’s sudden and high-intensity assaults, the Armed
Forces, in terms of defensive operations, should emphasize on redundant
capacity and sustainability of operational functions, and enhance critical

Part 2 National Defense Transformationt

Chapter 3 National Defense Policy


111


-----

infrastructure protection to prevent its main fighting force from being
paralyzed in the initial stage of military operations, and thereafter failing to
achieve strategic sustainment.

( Ⅵ )Considering the reality of quantitative inferiority in defense operations, the
ROC Armed Forces, when developing various capabilities, should focus on
the effectiveness of contingency operations and force mobility for swifter
response and smarter maneuver, in order to seize opportunities and reverse
unfavorable situations.

( Ⅶ )Targeting the enemy’s operational center of gravity (COG) and critical
vulnerabilities, the Armed Forces focuses on enhancing forces’ “basic
capabilities,” developing low loss, highly effective, low price and easy to
execute “asymmetrical warfighting capabilities,” and protecting important
military facilities. This is so that when conducting defense operations,
advantages in time and space can be utilized to defeat or paralyze the
enemy’s warfighting capabilities, create local battlefield superiority, and

further defeat invading enemy forces.

III. Force Buildup Plans and Objectives

The Armed Forces established force buildup policy and objectives based on
considerations of future strategic situations, defense requirements and acquirable
financial and human resources, drawing out specific plans for a modernized defense
force. This will establish reliable warfighting capabilities required for the strategic
objective of “resolute defense and credible deterrence.” The acquisition and
development of major weaponry and equipment are summarized as follows:

( Ⅰ ) Information and Electronic Warfare

The performance of airborne early warning (AEW) aircraft will continue to be
upgraded, radio models will be replaced, information and electronic warfare
equipment will be developed, and defense capabilities of critical C2 (command and

control) positions will be further enhanced, establishing an automated comprehensive
C4ISR system and network protection and counter attack management system
capabilities.

( Ⅱ ) Joint Counter Air Operations

Procuring F-16C/D fighters and upgrading capabilities of Chingkuo Fighters
(Indigenous Defense Fighter, IDF) will equip the Armed Forces with long-range and
beyond visual range (BVR) combat, advanced electronic warfare system, and airto-ground and air-to-sea missile capabilities. Furthermore, by procuring the Patriot
III missile system, establishing long-range early warning radars and enhancing
the performance of the Patriot II missile system, the Armed Forces will gain midrange anti-missile, low altitude air defense and mobile anti-aircraft missile system
capabilities.

( Ⅲ ) Joint Sea Control Operations

Procurement of diesel-electric submarines, P-3C long-range fixed-wing antisubmarine aircrafts, second generation II class ships, new generation missile
motorboats and minehunters will enhance the Armed Forces 3 dimensional joint
sea control capabilities, and strengthen counter blockade and joint interdiction
capabilities. In addition, fuel and ammunition supply ships will be constructed to
maintain the capabilities of surface operation groups, thus building a sea control
force equipped with anti-submarine, air defense and regional ocean surveillance
capabilities.

( Ⅳ ) Homeland Defense

Continued production of new multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS), tactical
wheeled vehicles, armored infantry combat vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAV) will further enhance surveillance and mobile strike capabilities of ground
forces. Also, new attack and utility helicopters will be procured to reinforce 3
dimension combat capabilities. In addition, in response to disaster relief becoming
one of the Armed Forces’ main missions, a number of disaster prevention and relief
equipment will be procured, including multipurpose engineer vehicles, forklifts,
NBC (nuclear, biological and chemical) protection equipment, sanitation equipment
and mobile cranes.

Section 4 A New Volunteer-Based Force

With consideration to the nation’s long-term development requirements and in
response to the public’s high expectations, the Ministry of National Defense
has formulated a plan to phase out the cunrent compulsory service system. This
transformation will build an elite Armed Forces that is capable of responding to
enemy threats, while resolving the issue of insufficient supply of able-bodied men as
a result of low birth rates and aging population. The implementation of voluntarism
has become a necessary change due to the sequential shortening of the compulsory
military service period, which has resulted in loss of training results as conscripts
draw near their discharge once their training is complete; voluntarism will not only
maintain forces’ capabilities and allow experiences to be passed down, it will also lift
the burden of compulsory military service from citizens, releasing human resources
for economic development, and allowing the nation’s human resources to create
maximum benefits.

I. Stable Growth of the Volunteer Force

Guided by the Executive Yuan’s financial resources and planning of the Armed
Forces’ “Jingtsui Program,” the number of volunteer servicemen will grow
sequentially each year over a 4 year period in the pattern “slow at first and gradually
pick up speed,” achieving an all-volunteer force by the end of 2014, thus allowing
the retention of an effective elite force capable of carrying out disaster relief missions
during peace time, and confronting the enemy during wartime.

II. Strictly Amend Military Service Related Laws

( Ⅰ ) Provided that the regular force will become an all-volunteer force in the
future, a full review should be conducted on management, cultivation,
career planning, selection and elimination and indemnity with regard to the
qualitative changes of military officers, NCOs and soldiers. Furthermore,
laws and regulations on selection for training, military service, commission,
assignment, military education, insurance and indemnity should be amended
to establish a thorough military personnel system consistent with future
situations.

( Ⅱ ) With consideration to changes in the population structure and the
government’s long-term population policy, the flexibility of draft age
men utilization will be increased to enhance national competitiveness.
The vision and policy objectives of voluntarism were planned in the light
of changes in manpower acquisition of regular forces and mobilization
training requirements of reserve forces; military service related laws will be
reviewed and amended to achieve the human resource utilization strategy of
“voluntarism during peacetime and conscription during wartime,” and satisfy
mobilization requirements for all-out defense.

III. Gradually Increase Recruitment and Retention
Incentives in Coordination with Financial
Resources

In view of experiences of countries practicing voluntarism, servicemen will be
offered better remuneration compared with private enterprises, full benefits and
care for their dependents, and a well-arranged diverse retirement mechanism, so
as to attract suitable youth with stable personalities and strong physique to enter
the military. In order to retain outstanding officers and soldiers, measures that will
be gradually implemented based on the government’s financial condition include
creating a high quality working environment, healthy careering planning, expanding
further education and training channels, enhancing education and training quality,
establishing retention (recruitment) incentive mechanisms, and strengthening care for
retirees and military dependents, thus freeing servicemen from worries and allowing
them to actively perform their duties; this is to achieve the objective of concentration
on defense readiness and letting dependents feel at ease.

IV. Complete Essential Prerequisites for Conversion
to Regular Service Military Training

Conversion to “Regular Service Military Training” is not only a matter of the
people’s rights and obligations, which should be stipulated by law, but also a matter
of satisfying the Armed Forces’ manpower requirements and maintaining capabilities.
Therefore, regular service military training may only be implemented once the
following conditions are satisfied:

Section 5 Amendments to Defense Law
System

With regard to requirements of national defense policy and future force developments,
the Ministry of National Defense has formulated and amended related laws based
on the principle of “administration according to law,” and established an annual
legislation plan to achieve legalization of the Armed Forces. The amendment of laws
also drives changes in defense policy, thus one of the Armed Forces’ focuses is to
establish a more thorough defense law system to achieve “legalization of national
defense,” whereas shaping the legal culture of defense agencies is a direction the
MND is working towards in order to improve citizen service quality and protect the
rights of the people.

I. Amendments to Organization Regulations of
Defense Agencies

In coordination with organizational restructuring of the Executive Yuan and force
restructuring of the ROC Armed Forces, a total of 12 bills were formulated based
on the principles of “thorough, flexible and effectiveness” and submitted to the
Executive Yuan, including 6 organization acts – “Organization Act of the Ministry of
National Defense,” “Organization Regulations of General Staff Headquarters of the
Ministry of National Defense,” “Organization Regulations of the General Political
Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense,” “Organization Regulations
of the Armaments Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense,” “Organization
Regulations of the Comptroller Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense” and
“Organization Regulations of the Medical Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of National
Defense,” and 6 regulations governing departmental affairs. The bills were passed on
to the Legislative Yuan, and the first reading was completed on March 24[th], 2011.

II. Complementary Legislation for Voluntarism

The military service system will be gradually changed from “conscription and
voluntarism” to “voluntarism,” and a legislation plan has been formulated based on
this process to control the completion of laws required for voluntarism.

in coordination with the amendment to Paragraphs 4~6 of Article 34 of the “Disaster
Prevention and Protection Act,” which states that the Armed Forces should actively
engage in disaster prevention and relief and may muster reserve forces for disaster


120

中華民國壹百年

國防報告書

relief operations, the MND has jointly established related regulations together with
the Ministry of the Interior, so as to complete laws on assisting with disaster relief.

( Ⅰ ) Enactment of the “Regulations on the ROC Armed Forces’
Assistance in Disaster Prevention and Relief”

Pursuant to Paragraph 6, Article 34 of the “Disaster Prevention and Protection Act,”
which was amended and promulgated on August 4[th], 2010, the Ministry of National
Defense and Ministry of the Interior jointly established the “Regulations on the
ROC Armed Forces’ Assistance in Disaster Prevention and Relief”; the Regulations
were announced on October 15[th], 2010. The Regulations clearly specify procedures,
advance deployment and dispatch of forces, command and dispatch, coordination and
communication, education and training, time limit of disaster relief operations and
other matters associated with applying for support from the Armed Forces, or with
the Armed Forces actively assisting with disaster relief.

( Ⅱ ) Amendment to the “National Defense Act” to include
Disaster Prevention and Relief

After legislators proposed that Articles 2, 3 and 14 of the “National Defense Act” be
amended, the MND’s response to the proposal was approved by legislators and passed
the third reading. The amendment lists disaster prevention and relief as a purpose
and within the scope of national defense, and also a part of military command. The
amendment was promulgated and took effect on November 24[th], 2010.

IV. Complementary Legislation for Converting the
Chung Shan Institute of Science and Technology
into an Administrative Institution

To enhance capabilities of the Chung Shan Institute of Science and Technology
(CSIST), Armaments Bureau capabilities for developing defense technology
industries and thus achieve self-reliant national defense, the MND plans to convert
the CSIST into an administrative institution and restructure it as the National Chung
Shan Institute of Science and Technology. The MND drafted the “Regulations on
the Establishment of National Chung Shan Institute of Science and Technology” and


Part 2 National Defense Transformationt

Chapter 3 National Defense Policy


121


-----

submitted it to the Legislative Yuan; the first reading of the regulations was completed
on March 24[th], 2011. Furthermore, in accordance with the Executive Yuan’s “Matters,
Timetable and Division of Labor for Restructuring Agencies into Administrative
Institutions,” the MND reviewed 18 laws and regulations associated with operations
of the CSIST, including the “Organization Regulations of the National Chung Shan
Institute of Science and Technology,” and 90 regulations on operating procedures
after conversion.

V. Legislative Matters Related to the Introduction
of Government Ethics Units

The MND has followed the policy guidance and brought in government ethics units,
adopting a “multiple supervision dual-tracks” approach for government ethics and
inspection units. There is a government ethics office in the MND directly under the
minister that forms a multiple supervision mechanism along with the Inspection
Office; the two offices coordinate and assist one another, and integrate functions
to jointly carry out anti-corruption missions. For the legalization of this initiative,
the MND coordinated with the Ministry of Justice, the competent authority of the
“Act of the Establishment of the Government Employee Ethics Units and Officers,”
in formulating a draft amendment to specify that the Ministry of National Defense
shall establish a government ethics unit, and that anti-corruption affairs of military
agencies without government ethics units shall be handled by government ethics units
of its superiors Furthermore, the MND added planning and execution of government
ethics affairs in the draft amendment to the “Organization Act of the Ministry of
National Defense.” Both amendments were submitted to the Executive Yuan and
passed on to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. In addition, the MND drafted the
“Regulations for Departmental Affairs of the Ministry of National Defense” to specify
the establishment of a government ethics office under the MND; the regulations were
submitted to the Executive Yuan in coordination with the organizational restructuring
timetable.

VI. Legalization of the Defense Think Tank

To improve the defense administration quality, the MND referred to the operations
and development experiences of advanced countries and planned the establishment of
a “defense think tank,” drafting the “Regulations on the Establishment of the Defense
Think Tank (provisional).” This defense think tank will benefit research on defense
affairs, expand international exchanges and cooperation, and provide forward-looking

recommendations for decision-making, thus enhancing national competitiveness. The
“preparatory office of the defense think tank” was established on March 1st, 2010 for
he implementation of subsequent matters.

VII. Transfer of Retiree Affairs

To implement voluntarism and organizational restructuring of the Armed Forces, 3
affairs have been transferred to the Veterans Affairs Commission, including: pension
and operating cost budgeting, pension payment, and counseling, services and care
offered in quarters for single retirees; the transfer of other affairs will be based on
the principle of not affecting service quality and the lawful rights of retirees, military
dependents and responsible staff.

and “centralized leadership.” Moreover, “civilian control
over military” regulates the Armed Forces by subjecting
it to the supervision of public opinion, ensuring its
nationalization and making the implementation of
defense affairs more efficient. Also, organizational
restructuring has been planned since 2010 based on the
concepts of streamlining the national defense organization
and maximizing the effects of military investments; a
suitable “force structure” was established by seeking
balance between “combat requirements” and “financial
capabilities,” building a modernized Armed Forces to
consolidate combat capabilities and complete the mission
of national defense transformation.

Section 3 Force Structure

To build elite Armed Forces that can adapt to the new era, the Ministry of National
Defense conducted a quantified analysis of modern warfare, military strategies,
operational requirements and the nation’s overall resource distribution, established
related policy, and completed the “Jingtsui Program” for force restructuring; the
total strength of the Armed Forces will be downsized from 275 thousand personnel
to 215 thousand personnel based on the principles of “streamlining high level staff
organizations,” “eliminating old equipment” and “outsourcing administrative and
logistics manpower.”

I. Considerations of Force Restructuring

( Ⅰ ) Changes in the Strategic Situation

The PRC’s comprehensive national power has taken great strides as a result of its
reform and opening-up in recent years, as well as its concentration on economic
development. Moreover, its defense budget has grown at double digit percentages
almost every year for nearly two decades, widening the gap of national and military
power between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait; balance of capabilities has been
lost, yet the PRC will continue to expand the scale and scope of its defense budget,
and gradually enhance its ability to terrorize with military force. Furthermore, the
core concept of the PRC’s current military strategy has been modified as “dual
application” and “fusion” of offensive and defensive capabilities, with an emphasis
on preventing crises and war, responding to multiple security threats and achieving
diverse military missions. After analyzing the military strength of both sides of the
Taiwan Strait, the Armed Forces has adjusted its strategic concept to “asymmetrical/
innovative” force deployment, avoiding conventional war of attrition, which will
deplete national resources.

( Ⅱ ) Changes in Operational Concepts

In the past, “victory” was perceived as overcoming the enemy on the battlefield.
However, considering the military strength of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait,

Part 2 National Defense Transformationt

Chapter 4 National Defense Organization


131


-----

we must use a practical attitude to reconsider the definition of “victory” if we are to
achieve “resolute defense and credible deterrence.”

After studying and analyzing the current situation of the Taiwan Strait, the definition
of “victory” was adjusted from “defeating the enemy in a full confrontation” to
“striking the enemy half way across the Taiwan Strait and preventing the enemy
from landing and establishing lodgment”; the force structure of the Armed Forces
was planned with a focus on gaining a relative advantage in this critical period of
war. This will not only allow a “small but superb, strong and smart” force to achieve
“resolute defense,” but also avoid engaging in an “armaments race” with the PRC,
which might affect the nation’s overall competitiveness.

( Ⅲ ) Reformation of the Military Service System

Outnumbered by the enemy, it is impossible to engage in a competition of quantity
with the PRC. The best approach to making enemies feel it difficult to prevail in war
over the Taiwan Strait is to strengthen the “quality” of our Armed Forces, and further
solidify concrete capabilities to deter the enemy from easily waging war. It can not
be denied that the reduced service period of conscribed servicemen, which has made
recruitment and discharge more frequent, has become a severe load on force defense
readiness and training, especially to the Navy and Air Force, which require long-term
training to build reliable capabilities. Facing diverse threats and multiple objective
missions, and considering that advanced armaments require professional training and
thorough integration procedures in order to maintain training intensity and operational
effectiveness, the Armed Forces is actively implementing “voluntarism” in hopes of
building a professional, powerful force capable of immediate combat engagement,
which will replace traditional forces consisting of conscripted soldiers.

( Ⅳ ) Reality of Human Resources

The number of draft age men has trended downwards in recent years due to the low
birth rates; statistics show that the number of draft age men each year has dropped
from over 120 thousand to some 110 thousand, and this number will continue to drop
in the future (anticipated number of draft age men from 2010-2015 is shown in Figure
4-4). Moreover, competition from similar agencies, such as the police and coast
guard, has made talent recruitment more and more difficult. The current situation of
human resources in Taiwan just isn’t enough to maintain such an immense military
organization. Thus, a complementary measure – service period adjustment, for force
restructuring was implemented, allowing those with the aspiration to join the military

and defend our nation; for those who hope to enter other fields, a shorter service
period will allow them to make earlier plans for their futures, compulsory military
service will no longer affect the plans of most men for their education, career and life,
allowing the nation’s human resources to be effectively utilized.

II. Force Structure Planning

( Ⅰ ) Restructuring Principles

Force restructuring of the Armed Forces is based on the principle of “streamlining
high level command and solidifying basic level forces,” in which priority is given
to streamlining administrative and logistics manpower. In coordination with the
geographic environment of Taiwan, the structure of armed services will continue
to be organized in the form of combined arms brigades, flotillas and wings. A
comprehensive review of organizational functions will be conducted, “commercial
maintenance” and “outsourcing” will be used to replace unnecessary personnel,
units with similar missions, tasks and properties will be merged, and organizations
will be streamlined to reduce non-combat personnel expenditure and personnel
maintenance costs. The high level command organization will be adjusted using the
approach “parallel streamlining and merging and vertical integration,” thus achieving

Part 2 National Defense Transformationt
133

Chapter 4 National Defense Organization


-----

“consistent authority and responsibility,” and creating an elite Armed Forces with
streamlined organization and enhanced performance.

( Ⅱ ) Restructuring Direction

Based on the principle of “administration according to law,” the Executive Yuan
sent 6 organization acts, including the “Organization Act of the Ministry of National
Defense,” to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation, and carried out organizational
restructuring based on deliberation results.

1. Ministry of National Defense: The original 6 departments and 6 offices were
adjusted into 4 departments and 7 offices based on the principle of merging
units with similar tasks and functions; the restructured departments and
offices are namely the Department of Strategic Planning, Department of
Resource Planning, Department of Legal Affairs, Department of Integrated
Assessment, All-Out Defense Mobilization Office, Administrative Affairs
Office, Defense Procurements Office, Inspector-General’s Office, Personnel
Office, Accounting Office and Civil Service Ethics Office.

2. General Staff Headquarters: The General Affairs Office was dissolved
and the original 7 staff units were merged into 6 staff units. The Military
Policy Command Headquarters and Reserve Command Headquarters were

Section 1 Intangible Combat Capability

Intangible combat capability is a key factor in war. The contents and spirit of the
ROC Constitution are the core values of the ROC Armed Forces. In response to the
policy to “build elite Armed Forces” and bring the Armed Forces’ “smart power”
into full play, besides further strengthening tangible combat capabilities, the Armed
Forces even more strives to establish intangible combat capabilities, so that it may
become guardians of national security. In practice, morale education that changes and
influences unobtrusively and imperceptibly is employed to encourage military ethics
and loyalty, to solidify fundamental beliefs of military servicemen, and to harness
esprit de corps. In coordination with exercises and training of the Armed Forces, this
creates determination for victory and multiplies the effects of tangible and intangible
combat capabilities.

I. Enhancing Military Ethics Education,
Solidifying Beliefs of Military Servicemen:

To strengthen military ethics in the ROC Armed Forces, starting in military
academies the weight of military ethics will be increased in basic, advanced and
further education stages, cultivating competent loyal officers with moral integrity
“conscientiousness, fearlessness, patriotism and compassion.” Furthermore, “patriotic
education” and “workshops for military officers” offered to military academy
graduates foster a correct code of conduct among officers at each level in the chain
of command, and strengthens military ethics and moral principles. For active and
reserve duty education, morale education themes are formulated each month, and
diverse training and education courses and campaigns are employed to solidify
the fundamental beliefs – “country, duty, honor” of military servicemen, inspiring
enthusiasm, diligence, honor and patriotism. Diverse training and education courses
in 2010 included the production of 65 episodes of the “Jyu Guang TV Program,” 74
special columns, 195 lectures given by scholars and experts, and implementation of
“intangible combat capability week” project.

II. Shaping Role Models, Inheriting an Honorable
History:

To promote the Huangpu spirit of “sacrifice, unity, responsibility,” the Armed Forces
has strengthened its historical inheritance education in its exercise and training
schedule, during important festivities and on commemoration days of historical
battles, and organized commendations of role models, held the commemoration
of major battles and promoted military songs, helping servicemen understand the
honorable history of the Armed Forces so as to nurture unselfish patriotism. In 2009
and 2010 the Armed Forces held the “60[th ]Anniversary of the Battle of Kuningtou,”
“55[th] Anniversary of the Battle of Yijiangshan” and the “Armed Forces Day and
65[th] Anniversary of Victory of the War of Resistance,” showing the patriotic loyalty
and determination of the Armed Forces to protect our nation. In addition, the Armed
Forces produced a series of TV programs, including “Glory and Heritage – A
Retrospection of the Founding of the Armed Forces,” “Stories of Heroic Figures in
History” and “Special Report on the Black Bat Squadron,” and published over 200
articles to describe the heroic deeds and sacrifice of veterans, including “Recruitment
of the Army 1[st] Special Forces, Recognition of Contributions of Veterans” and
“Sacrifices of Members of the Black Cat and Black Bat Air Squadrons, Becoming
Witnesses of History” commending role models to encourage servicemen to follow in
their footsteps, so as to inherit the honorable history of the ROC Armed Forces.

III. Gaining Insight on Enemy Threats,
Strengthening Patriotic Beliefs:

In response to national security threats and defense operation requirements, the ROC
Armed Forces is taking active measures to expand the content of its enemy awareness
education, and has established teaching and research capabilities to counter the “three
warfare”; “forums” are held on a regular basis, in which 114 scholars participated
in the 5 forums that were held from 2010 to May 2011, publishing papers and
proposing recommendations regarding “three warfare” strategies of the PLA and
countermeasures. In addition, educational programs were produced and broadcasted
to help servicemen understand developments of the enemy situation, strengthening
their belief in “Fight for the survival and development of the ROC and fight for
the safety and welfare of the people in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu,” and
achieving the strategic goals of “prevent war,” “defend our territory,” “contingency
response and countermeasure,” “prevent conflict” and “regional stability.”
“Psychological quality,” “reasonable risk” and “battlefield pressure resistance”

training courses based on mission characteristics have been offered in the northern
and southern training centers of the Armed Forces with 3 educational goals to “build
self-confidence,” “enhance esprit de corps” and “overcome fear in the battlefield.”
An audience of 9,277 people received such training till May 2011, enhancing the
psychological quality of military servicemen so that their capabilities may be fully
utilized.

IV. Implementing Anti-Corruption, Establishing
Proper Military Discipline:

To follow through with the government’s “promoting integrity and anti-corruption”
policy and to continue efforts of the “Anti-Corruption Action Plan”, the Ministry
of National Defense established the “Anti-Corruption Work Meeting” hosted by
the Minister, and began operations in July 2010. The work meeting focuses on the
current status of “anti-corruption” and improvement measures, and organized an

“Anti-Corruption Task Force” to integrate auditing and investigations, effectively
evaluate risk and provide preliminary measures for units to adopt; this allows the
joint implementation of anti-corruption and rectification of conduct and discipline,
achieving the goal of establishing proper military discipline.

V. Strengthening Patriotic Loyalty, Preventing
Secret Leakage:

After the serious incident of a high ranking officer leaking national security secrets
was recently discovered, the Ministry of National Defense reviewed its workflow
for flaws and formulated measures to strengthen weaknesses with the attitude “to
know shame and illness and feel pangs over a past mistake.” Force and military
academy education were utilized to solidify the patriotic thoughts of “know shame,
value morality and speak of honor,” so that servicemen will be able to distinguish
between truth and falsehood and the loyal and treacherous. In terms of policy, system
and practice, the Ministry of National Defense has reinforced its counterintelligence,
raised its security awareness and adopted aggressive measures to purge all enemy
spies, so as to ensure the security of the ROC Armed Forces.

Section 2 Joint Operation Effectiveness

Plans for building the ROC Armed Forces is focused on developing “joint operation
capabilities.” Besides implementing the “joint operations command mechanism”
and enhancing its capabilities, the Armed Forces combines concepts of “revolution
in military affairs,” organizational restructuring and armaments upgrade with an
emphasis on unifying the command authority of joint operations, so as to build a
“joint operations force” with “accelerated command speed and convenient logistic
support,” which will bring joint capabilities into full play and allow us to prevail over
the enemy.

I. Concepts

The ROC Armed Forces is actively building a “Hard ROC” defense force in
accordance with the military strategic concept of “resolute defense and credible
deterrence,” and utilizes robust joint operations mechanisms and modernized
battlefield management in coordination with diverse measures to achieve credible
deterrence, counter the enemy’s missile capabilities and launch strikes in-depth
against enemy, destroying, limiting and depleting the enemy’s abilities to invade
Taiwan.

Joint operations of the ROC Armed Forces is focused on building “long range
precision operations” and “synchronous joint engagement” capabilities, and the
simultaneous application of precision strikes, multilayered interceptions, anchorage
and beachhead attacks, and asymmetrical operations. When the enemy’s intention
to invade is apparent or the enemy has already taken action, troops and fire support
of the Armed Forces is deployed according to their effective range to “disable the
enemy’s operational center of gravity,” execute “joint interception” and “anchorage
and beachhead attack,” and achieve the military strategic goals of “preventing
enemies from landing and disembarking on Taiwan.”

Part 3 National Defense Capabilities

Chapter 5 National Defense Force


145


-----

II. Command Mechanism

In order to establish mechanisms that are “consistent and accountable in peacetime
and wartime” and are able to bring out the full effects of joint operations, the “ROC
Armed Forces Joint Operation Command Center” directly commands “all levels
of strategic execution,” creating a closely knit joint operations command network
(as shown in Figure 5-1) that achieves “simplified force deployment,” “flattened
command hierarchy” and “rapid and precise command.”

The key to whether the “joint operations command mechanism” is successful or
not lies within the link between the “command and control system” and “battlefield
management system.” In order to strengthen battlefield management functions, gain
control over the battlefield situation, coordinate fire support, gain target intelligence,
assess results of battle and exercise command and control, besides further enhancing
command and control functions, the Armed Forces has effectively integrated C4ISR
systems with weapon platforms, establishing joint operations images that are
provided to each level of command for synchronous control over the battlefield. This
strengthens battlefield monitoring capabilities and effectively implements battlefield
management, enhancing combat command and control functions and benefitting the
successfully execution of joint operations.

III. Capability Buildup

In response to the threat of the PRC’s continuous military expansion, besides
actively implementing reorganization, promoting all-out defense and enhancing
joint operation effectiveness, the combat capabilities of three military services have
been integrated to apply precision strikes, multilayered interceptions, anchorage
and beachhead attacks and asymmetrical warfare techniques, thereby achieving
the objective of territorial defense. Related capability development includes joint
C4ISR, joint information and electronic warfare, joint counter air, joint sea control,
joint ground defense, asymmetrical warfare, reserve mobilization, joint logistics, and
overall intangible combat capabilities.

In response to the enemy’s development of stealth technology and threat to the
electromagnetic environment of the Taiwan Strait, the Armed Forces will not
only continue to enhance its maritime and air early warning, surveillance and
reconnaissance capabilities, but also verify its capabilities in various trainings and
exercises, making suitable additions or revisions to enhance the contingency response
capabilities of its forces. Furthermore, the Armed Forces prevents enemies from
carrying out reconnaissance, interference and destroy missions via the establishment
of spectrum management and databases of electronic parameters and integrating
reconnaissance, interference, deception and destroy measures of its electronic
warfare system. The Armed Forces is also actively developing key technologies of
asymmetrical warfare to ensure smooth command and control and protect the safety
of combat operations; an electromagnetic shield has been established along the
boundaries of our territory, and brings out the full effects of joint electronic warfare
capabilities, gaining superority in the countermeasure of electromagnetic spectrum.

III. Enhancing Information and Assuring
Capabilities

With regard to information warfare, the Armed Forces employs “early warning
and rapid response” mechanisms to prevent information warfare attacks via
various means, thereby achieving the objective of “information assurance.”

Section 4 Logistics Support

Based on the “Quadrennial Defense Review” and concept of joint operation, the
ROC Armed Forces adopted a system that incorporates both “joint logistics” and
“individual armed service logistics” on the basis of the “joint logistics” system, so as
to establish “precise, rapid and effective” logistics management mechanisms. To meet
requirements of forces buildup and preparation missions and to achieve the objective
of supporting joint war fighting, the Armed Forces has planned development
directions for logistics renovation, formulated policy objectives and administration
guidelines, and enhanced its logistics support capabilities in accordance with the
“Quadrennial Defense Review.”

I. Logistics System Adjustments in Coordination
with Force Structure Planning

In accordance with the policy guidance “specialized logistics should be carried out by
its respective armed service, general logistics of the Armed Forces should be handled
by the Army,” the Combined Logistics Command on January 1[st], 2011, transferred
the maritime, air accessory warehouse to the navy and air force and renamed it the
“General Accessory Warehouse” to complete dedicated logistics functions for each
armed service. Authority over ground equipment repair and maintenance, general
supplies (provisions, clothing, fuel), general parts, non-staple food supply, general
ammunition, transportation and health services was given to the Army Command
Headquarters. In addition, logistics operations, operating procedures and division of
authority and responsibility were refined and simplified in coordination with logistics
organizational restructuring, establishing robust logistics systems and mechanisms
that are systematic, standardized and specialized, meeting the requirements of force
buildup and combat readiness.

II. Precise Preparation of Supplies, Effective
Budget Control

To cut down on maintenance expenditure and increase the precision of supplies
preparation, equipment parts supply chains are thoroughly reviewed with
consideration to the annual strategic commercial maintenance policy; based on “annual
maintenance plans and operating procedures for preparation of supplies,” information

mechanisms and functions are utilized for the strict control of procurements and
consumption, realizing planned preparation of supplies and effectively utilizing repair
and maintenance budgets.

III. Ensuring Fuel Storage Safety, Enhancing
Operational Efficiency

To elevate the safety and efficiency of the Armed Forces’ fuel transport and supply
and to ensure the safety of its fuel storage, after conducting risk assessments, the
replacement of old fuel pipes was listed in the investment projects of 2012 to 2020.
Each year the Armed Forces’ 35 fuel storages and 434 fuel tanks are cleaned and
examined. Furthermore, the project of “automatic monitoring system for fuel tank
transport and storage facilities and pollution prevention” was completed, adding
a level meter and soil and waste water monitoring system to ensure fuel storage
safety. In addition, to prevent military refueling points from leaking fuel and causing
pollution, pollution prevention facilities were built in the Armed Forces’ 30 refueling
points, including cathodic protection system in fuel tanks, fuel pipes with double
layered casing, oil collector at the bottom of fuel dispensers, vapor recovery system
in fuel tanks, vapor recovery system in fuel dispensers, leak detectors and monitoring
wells.

IV. Expanding Supply Sources from Wholesalers to
Enhance Supply Efficiency

The source of supplies has been expanded to wholesale markets in accordance
with regulations of the Government Procurement Act and in coordination with
requirements of the Armed Forces. Contracts have been signed with a total of 28
private firms, allowing the procurement of 12,729 types of supplies, effectively
reducing the time for procuring supplies and lowering the storage load of military
warehouses.

V. Implementing the Commercial Maintenance
Policy, Enhancing Repair and Procurement
Control

In order to cut down on national defense spending, outsourced maintenance of the
Armed Forces’ equipment must be for the purpose of independent national defense
or supporting combat readiness. The maintenance of armaments and equipment that

國防報告書

are non-sensitive, indirect to combat readiness or non-essential is outsourced to the
private sector, utilizing its capabilities in the development of defense technology
industries. Furthermore, technology transfers are implemented to achieve the
objective of independent national defense. Under the premise of retaining the Armed
Forces’ existing capabilities and execution in accordance with the law, the scope of
commercial maintenance will gradually be expanded based on implementation results
and capabilities of the private sector.

( Ⅰ )The “strategic commercial maintenance” contract amount supervision and
control outline plan was promulgated to enhance control over repair and
procurement of materials associated with commercial maintenance cases.
Any materials that can be procured via military channels and provided to
contractors for maintenance within the designated time period may not be
outsourced. Maintenance within the capabilities of the Armed Forces and not
exceeding the load of maintenance units must be executed within the Armed
Forces and may not be outsourced, thereby reducing expenditures.

( Ⅱ )Continued implementation of strategic commercial maintenance operations
has lowered personnel and maintenance cost. From 2003 to the end of 2010,
the amount of outsourced maintenance and procurement of various models
of military aircrafts, vessels and ground equipment reached NT$28.8 billion,
averaging over NT$3.6 billion each year. Considering that the logistics
organization will be facing restructuring and downsizing as a result of
voluntarism, existing contracts will be reviewed for revision (extension)
and plans will be made for the expansion of the scope of items that can be
outsourced; during “military goods manufacturing (maintenance)” operations,
qualified satellite firms will be established to expand the source of procuring
military supplies and disperse risk of commercial maintenance, achieving the
effect of “national defense industries striking roots in the private sector.”

VI. Refining Transportation Planning for Better
Logistics Performance

In coordination with military and economic developments, old vehicles will be
replaced with new ones to enhance the Armed Forces’ combat readiness in terms
of transportation. The Combined Logistics Command is in charge of the unified
procurement of civilian vehicles; a total of 2,531 vehicles of various models will be
replaced (to be acquired in 2013-2015) to maintain traffic safety. The construction of

port facilities and air delivery site preparations on Taiwan and offshore islands will
be continued to support readiness exercises and training missions, as well as improve
transportation for servicemen performing their duties, enhancing service quality and
achieving smooth military transport.

Seeing that military servicemen and civilians on offshore islands are often unable
to return to their hometowns for major holidays due to weather reasons, military
aircrafts (vessels) are dispatched to help them return to their hometowns under the
premise of not affecting the Armed Forces’ readiness exercises and training missions,
as well as not affecting the business of private transport companies. To resolve
the issue of travelers being held up on offshore islands, C-130 transport aircrafts
were dispatched on 57 flights in 2010 to transport 4,272 person-times of military
servicemen, dependents and civilians (as shown in Table 5-2).

VII. Overall Arsenal Planning, Improvement of
Storage Facilities

To implement ammunition storage management, effectively alleviate storage
pressure, and reduce the ammunition decay rate, storage facilities have been
renovated (improved) and overall plans have been made for ammunition storage. A
total of 2,574 old unsuitable ammunition storages have been merged or eliminated
up to now. Furthermore, a budget of over NT$300 million was allocated for storage
facility improvements, completing facility renovation for 1,153 ammunition storages
(e.g. environment control, warning and monitoring system, and fire system), and
planning the construction of 16 new ammunition storages. Suitable merging of
ammunition storages in response to urban development and requirements of regional
readiness missions not only reduces the management load of forces, but also ensure
the operational safety of ammunition storages.

VIII. Consumption of Old Ammunition to Reduce
Ammunition Disposal

The Armed Forces controls its ammunition by “consuming ammunition with
smaller lot numbers first” and “using precision munitions for target practice before
its expiration date.” These principles ensure the combat readiness of ammunition,
reduce its storage load and risk, and prevent large quantities of munitions that are
about to expire from affecting operations and training, reducing ammunition disposal
and cutting down on defense spending. A total of 41 ammunition lots with a total
of 54,998 bullets have been consumed, saving over NT$360 million spent on waste
ammunition disposal. In addition, the Armed Forces completed the disposal of 8,428
and 7,745 tons of waste ammunition in 2009 and 2010, respectively; in 2010, 3,745
tons of waste ammunition was disposed of by the Combined Logistics Command,
Chung Shan Institute of Science and Technology and Ammunition Disposal Center,
and disposal of the remaining 4,000 tons was outsourced to overseas; disposal of all
waste ammunition will be completed by October 2011.

IX. Improving Bomb Disposal to Eliminate Safety
Risks

Medium and small caliber bombs are disposed of using demolition grounds or
bombing ranges as soon as possible. Disposal of large bombs is being actively
outsourced to reduce storage time and lower safety risks.

X. Expansion of Logistics Outsourcing
in Coordination with Organizational
Restructuring

To implement the policy of self-reliant national defense, facilitating development of
private industries and expanding domestic demand, the scope of outsourcing with
regard to logistics will be expanded and reviewed in coordination with organizational
restructuring of the “Jingtsui Program,” utilizing resources of the private sector to
achieve the objective of combining national defense with economic developments. Up
to now, outsourcing and evaluations of labor services include 1 case of privatization,
17 cases of strategic commercial maintenance of equipment, 16 cases of food service
operations and administrative operations (environment facilities, vehicle transport);
results will be reviewed between 2011 and 2012 and subsequent outsourcing cases
will be gradually released, maintaining current logistics capabilities while ensuring
the success of outsourcing.

XI. Integrated Logistics Information, Precise
Decision-Making Support

The Armed Forces utilized cloud computing services and technologies to integrate
the logistics information system and create a data sharing environment. The Armed
Forces integrated armada management requirements of each armed service in 2010
and completed the development of an aircraft supply and maintenance system,
integrating air logistics management via a common platform; the “military logistics
management system” was modified to simplify supply and maintenance operating
procedures and forms, and new functions were added, including control over transport
of supplies, traffic flow control and monitoring, transportation route planning, control
over supply levels and dynamic management of forces, allowing real-time control
over logistics resources, current status and requirements of forces for making suitable
adjustments. This effectively reduces the time required for logistics, enhances the
precision and speed of management, reduces manpower load, lowers maintenance
cost, and achieves the objective “precise logistics management and rapid logistics
support.”

XII. Facility Improvements for Better Quality of
Life

To care for active military servicemen, military dependents and retirees, the
Ministry of National Defense will review its budget each year to implement facility
improvements in military quarters for staffs and retirees, prioritizing based on actual
requirements of each unit and urgency of each case; this will eliminate safety risks,
enhance capabilities of the Armed Forces and make subordinates more devoted. A
total budget of NT$4.31724 billion was allocated for facility maintenance in 2009
and 2010, in which NT$16.55 million was allocated for renovating and improving
the living environment of 10 “retiree quarters” in 2010, including the “Fengnien
Retiree Quarters” in Taipei City; with regard to “staff quarters,” NT$8.91 million was
allocated for 20 cases of the Army’s “rooftop leak prevention and wiring inspections
in the Tzuguang village No.11”; a total of NT$143.2 million will be allocated for 25
cases of the Army’s “rooftop leak prevention and renovations in Tzuguang village
No.28” in 2011.

Section 1 National Defense Human
Resources

The quality of defense human resources is the key to force development, combat
readiness and mission execution of the Armed Forces. Facing a volatile strategic
environment with new technologies and armaments being developed on a daily
basis, the Armed Forces has adopted a number of measures to maintain its advantage
in high quality human resources, including diverse officer and NCO recruitment
program, continued enhancement of curriculums of military academies, the creation
of a good learning environment, and encouraging cadres to pursue further degrees and
participate in various exchange and training courses; such measures have cultivated
excellent human resources to serve our nation.

I. Extensive Recruitment of Excellent Talents

Measures that have been adopted to recruit excellent youth to serve our nation include
flexible recruitment strategies, expanding recruitment channels, and strengthening
evaluation and control measures; overall planning of government and private
resources, propaganda via media, and uniting efforts of different departments; suitable
adjusting recruitment methods in coordination with trends of the employment market;
and improving recruitment quality and customer services via the implementation of
evaluations, so as to achieve talent recruitment goals of each stage.

( Ⅰ ) Expanding Recruitment Channels

Market surveys are conducted to analyze and learn how civilians gain recruitment
information of the Armed Forces, and existing resources of the Armed Forces is
utilized to increase the visibility of recruitment information via diverse channels, both
public and private, e.g. setting up links on job bank websites.

( Ⅱ ) Flexible Recruitment Strategies

In addition to the Elite Program and base visits, recruitment campaigns will be
extended into campuses and career fairs. Flyers and brochures of each armed force
will be produced for the public to become acquainted with the Armed Forces,
understand the Armed Forces, and thereby become willing to join the Armed Forces.


Part 3 National Defense Capabilities

Chapter 6 National Defense Resources

( Ⅲ ) Strengthening Evaluation and Control Measures

Work performance evaluations and service satisfaction surveys are conducted on an
annual basis for recruitment units to use as reference, allowing them to refine their
recruitment methods and actively improve their service quality, thereby attracting
excellent talents to join the Armed Forces and satisfy requirements on basic level
forces.

II. Proper Military Education

Military education is a link in the nation’s overall education and aims to “edify and
cultivate” cadres of armed forces. Military education on one hand cultivates cadres
with independent thinking, judgment and problem solving abilities by systematically
passing on basic knowledge and skills, and on the other hand fosters servicemen
with military ethics and strong physical ability, turning them into modern servicemen
who are loyal to the country, willing to take responsibility and value honor. Future
endeavors to highlight features and advantages of military education include
enhancing teaching equipment and facilities in military academies, implementing
reasonably strict management and training, and offering excellent instructors and
instruction quality.

( Ⅰ ) Expanding Education Channels

In order to establish a comprehensive education environment, the Ministry of
National Defense will continue to strengthen courses, curriculums, instructors and
instructions of basic, advanced and further education in response to domestic and
foreign changes and the nation’s strategic goals; in addition to education equipment
and facilities of military academies, matching measures will also be gradually
strengthened. Furthermore, channels for further education will also be expanded: in
terms of full-time master’s and doctoral programs, the number of military personnel
that enrolled in the National Defense University, National Defense Medical Center,
domestic and foreign universities in 2009 and 2010 are shown in Table 6-1; in terms
of further education, 9 types of courses were offered, including the National Defense
University War College, Management College Strategy Course, Command and Staff
Colleges of the three armed services, and the Management College Command and
Staff Course, as shown in Table 6-2. Furthermore, with regard to on-the-job degree
courses, 5,096 seats were approved in 2010. Subsidies totaling to NT$94.59 million
were granted in 2010 to help cadres to gain ROC technician certificates from public

( Ⅱ ) Enhancing Instruction Capabilities

The Armed Forces hopes to expand the use of military academy teaching capabilities
to strengthen the link between education and training with practices, expand training
opportunities for cadres, and train personnel with regard to e-learning methods. At
the same time, to strengthen the professional competencies of volunteer soldiers,
the Armed Forces will utilize existing skill certification and training mechanisms to
help military servicemen gain civilian expertise, thus cultivating military servicemen
with high levels of techniques. In recent years, the Armed Forces has enhanced the
certification training capabilities of its Vocational Training Center, which offered 126
training courses with admission quotas totaling to 2,664 persons 2010. In addition, the
Air Force Institute of Technology completed the nation’s first technical subject testing
site for “aircraft maintenance class B certification,” which was found as a qualified
testing site after evaluation; besides meeting requirements for aircraft maintenance
training, the testing site has complete functions from education, training to usage, and
also supports the Council of Labor Affairs’ promotions of professional certification.

( Ⅲ ) Establishment of an Evaluation System

To verify the performance of military academies under the Ministry of National
Defense, all military academies accepted the Ministry of Education’s evaluation
and accreditation in 2010; all departments and institutes of the military academies
passed the evaluation. Furthermore, 26 departments and institutes of the Military
Academy, Naval Academy, National Defense University Institute of Technology
and National Defense Medical Center passed certifications of professional civilian
institutions, including the Institute of Engineering Education Taiwan, Taiwan Medical
Accreditation Council and Taiwan Nursing Accreditation Council, showing that the
departments have reached considerably high levels in terms of teaching, research,
service and administrative support. To continue the improvement of education quality,
each military academy has established annual self-evaluation mechanisms for the
school and each department, benefitting the enhancement of cadres’ job skills.

( Ⅳ ) Continuous Education Reformation

To better the quality of military education and develop innovative contents, measures
that have been adopted include strengthening curriculum design, cultivating
excellent instructors, and using the ISO9001 certification as a standard for education


166


-----

中華民國壹百年

國防報告書

and administration quality of military academies, enhancing their administrative
efficiency. Furthermore, military academies will enter into strategic alliances with
civilian universities and research institutions based on the concept of teaching
resource sharing, building an interactive platform to create a robust military education
environment.

( Ⅴ ) Implementing Education Exchanges

To foster cadres with an international perspective, the Ministry of National Defense
in 2010 selected outstanding personnel to receive basic education, military sales,
and military further education training overseas. To maintain friendly relations
with our allies, international trainees were accepted from ally countries to receive
basic education and further education; a national development course for allies was
offered to help personnel of allies understand our political, military and economic
developments and current situation, as shown in Table 6-3.

Ⅲ Precise Preparation of Supplies, Effective
Budget Control

NCOs are the backbone of basic level units, guardians of forces, and an important key
to the success of “voluntarism.” In order to fully utilize the functions of NCOs so that
they gain full authorization from commissioned officers, who will then be enabled
to focus on planning and leadership, NCOs dedicate themselves to management,
education and training; NCOs manage NCOs to establish a sense of responsibility
and honor. Therefore, the current status of measures implemented to improve the
NCO system on its current basis and in coordination with plans for an all-volunteer
force is as follows:

( Ⅰ ) Significant Change in Ratio of Volunteers to Conscripts

The ratio of volunteers to conscripts in NCOs significantly increased from 70:30 in
2009 to the current 90:10; the number of volunteer NCOs grew to over 10 thousand,
while the number of conscripted NCOs dropped significantly, gradually changing the
structure of the NCO system in coordination with the timetable for an all-volunteer
force.

2.Military sales training: To learn and acquire the latest military strategies, tactics, logistics, technologies, doctrines and teaching materials,
personnel must be sent abroad for training on the operation and maintenance of armaments acquired from military sales because such training
is not offered domestically.
3.Military further education: Refers to command and staff courses offered by military academies and courses of the War College on military and
national strategies and international relations.
4.Course for friendly countries: Trainees from friendly countries are invited to help them understand our political and economic developments
and status quo.

( Ⅱ ) Strengthening International Exchanges of NCOs

To strengthen the practical abilities and combat skills of NCOs, over 20 outstanding
NCOs were selected and sent abroad for exchanges, visits and to attend leadership
training and combat training courses. After the NCOs returned to Taiwan they
became seed instructors and significantly enhanced management capabilities and
force training results.

( Ⅲ ) Establishing High Level Sergeant Major Positions

To implement and perfect the parallel development system of commissioned officers
and NCOs, NCO supervisors and staff positions are placed at the command, corps,
brigade, battalion, and company levels according to the “Guidelines on Establishing
NCO Supervisors at Different Levels.”

( Ⅳ ) Division of Authority and Responsibility between
Commissioned Officers and NCOs

“NCO review meetings” are held at the company level to the command level as a
means of division of authority and responsibility between commissioned officers
and NCOs. Authority over promotions, transfers, position assignments, trainings,
punishments and rewards, and performance reviews associated with NCOs and
soldiers trickle down to NCOs at each level.

( Ⅴ ) Academy Instructor and Cadre Positions for NCOs

Instructor, umpire and cadre positions for NCOs have been established in
coordination with organizational restructuring, and will be further adjusted along with
force restructuring of the “Jingtsui Program,” so as to strengthen the expertise and
leadership of NCOs.

( Ⅵ ) Establishing Career Planning Sergeants

To help active servicemen understand their future developments in the military, the
Armed Forces began offering “career planning sergeant courses,” which referred
to retention counselor training courses of the U.S. Army, to train professionals in
the military. At present, there are a total of over 700 “career planning sergeants” in
each command of the Armed Forces, and they are supported with various retention
measures to achieve the objective of retaining excellent human resources.

( Ⅶ ) Building an NCO Service Record System

In response to the “voluntarism” policy and NCO system developments, the “Training
and Promotion Ranking Chart for Army, Navy and Air Force NCOs” was formulated
based on the training and promotion ranking chart for commissioned officers, setting
standards for NCOs to benefit talent selection, cultivation and utilization.

( Ⅷ ) Guidelines on Staying Overnight off Base

In response to the policy to maintain the peace of mind of forces, to help soldiers
settle down, and to let their dependents feel at ease, reducing the difference between
military life and family life, the Ministry of National Defense drafted “Guidelines
on Volunteer Servicemen Staying Overnight off Base,” hoping to let volunteer
servicemen care for their families, dependents, or pursue further education when they
are off duty; each service completed detailed plans based on the characteristics of
their missions, so as to boost morale among troops.

Ⅳ Implementation of the Civilian Defense Official
Policy

The two defense acts establish a national defense system with civilian control over
military and centralized leadership. In order to help civilian defense officials gain
visionary, thorough decision-making ability with regard to national defense policy and
resources, and to integrate military and civilian perspectives, improve communication
and negotiation, and enhance the effectiveness of military-civilian cooperation, the
Ministry of National Defense’s organization of civilian defense officials, cultivation
policy and reformation and improvement methods are as follows:

( Ⅰ ) Organization of Civilian Defense Officials

Since the promulgation of the Two Defense Acts on March 1[st], 2002, no less than
one-third of the 611-member staff of the MND, as dictated by the Organization Act
of the Ministry of National Defense, will be civilian official positions, as required
by Paragraph 2, Article 15. 204 civilian positions have been established, with two
specially commissioned officials, 84 senior officials, 84 associate officials, and 34
junior officials. Suitable professional civilian officials are employed through “national
examinations” and “open selection” methods as required by relevant legislations such
as the Examination Act, Employment Act, and Promotion Act for Civil Servants, in
according to the nature and volume of work in various units and personnel quotas.
There are currently 168 personnel as of April 30th, 2011, which has reached 82.35%
of total staff size, as shown in Tables 6-4 to 6-6.

( Ⅱ ) Civilian Defense Official Cultivation

Training for civilian defense officials is based on the policy of “training for
deployment.” Regulations, such as the “Guidelines for the Training, Advanced
Education, and Lifelong Learning of Civilian Personnel in the Ministry of National
Defense” and “Staff Training Implementation Plan for Military and Civilian Officials
of the Ministry of National Defense,” were formulated and enacted in accordance
with the “Civil Servant Training and Further Education Act” and its enforcement rules
and the “Regulations on Civil Servants Training and Development in the Executive
Yuan and Subordinate Agencies and Schools.” Training for civilian defense officials
was incorporated in military training courses, so that civilian officials who enter the
Ministry of National Defense may rapidly become familiar with defense affairs, thus
enhancing the professional defense expertise of civilian officials, strengthening the
competencies of current personnel and cultivating excellent talents.

( Ⅲ ) Civilian Defense Official Reformation and Improvement
Methods

1. All work in the MND is organized with joint military and civilian
participation to obtain benefits from complementary military and civilian
perspectives. “Professional core competency” training has emphasized on
“defense strategy planning,” “defense resource planning,” “reserve affairs,”
“historical and administrative archives” and “integrated assessments” since
2006; a total of 237 persons received training in 2010, and related training
will continue to be provided in 2011.

2. In accordance with the five core values “integrity, loyalty, professionalism,
performance, and compassion” advocated by the Executive Yuan on
November 3[rd], 2009, in terms of educational training and work, various
occasions will be used to provide information and training to military and
civilian personnel, thus increasing their interaction and establishing positive
military-civilian relationships; a total of 192,032 persons participated in
2010, and related training will continue to be provided in 2011.

3. In accordance with the “Jingtsui Program” implemented by the MND,
civilian defense officials are appointed as supervisors of the Department
of Strategic Planning, Department of Resources, Integrated Assessment
Office, All-out Defense Mobilization Office, Civil Service Ethics Office,
Department of Manpower and Comptroller Bureau.

-----

4. Positions that can be held by both military and civilian officials have been
planned in the General Political Warfare Bureau and Comptroller Bureau.
However, due to restrictions of the “Central Government Agency Personnel
Quota Law,” the quota of 282 civilian officials of the MND can only be
employed within the MND, Armaments Bureau and Medical Affairs
Bureau, for this reason there is no sufficient quota for the General Political
Warfare Bureau and Comptroller Bureau to recruit civilian defense officials;
the positions may be held by civilian officials if the quota is increased in the
future.

5. In response to the draft amendment to Article 17 of the “Public Functionaries
Appointment Act,” which states that civil servants must currently hold a
9[th] grade associate position or equal position before they get promoted to a
senior official position, a section chief position was established to protect the
rights of associate officials to attend training, liquidifying their channels for
promotion.

6. Rely on the participation of civilian defense officials, and provide them with
a well planned system for training, further education, promotion and transfer,
performance evaluation, disciplinary actions and rewards, and benefits, so
that they will be satisfied with their work, glad to remain in their positions,
and devote even more effort to national defense affairs.

Section 2 National Defense Financial
Resources

Financial resources are properly allocated for national defense with consideration
of the nation’s overall economic development, the government’s financial burdens,
national security, enemy threats and current national defense policy. Furthermore,
budgeting and execution are based on the principle to economize, hoping to allocate a
reasonable, suitable and feasible budget under the supervision of public opinion, and
to maximize the benefits obtained from this budget.

I. Defense Financial Resource Acquisition

The central government must properly and cautiously allocate its overall budget
after evaluating the international situation, national policy and its financial condition.
The national defense budget is a part of the government’s overall budget, and
must operate in coordination with the nation’s budgetary system and financial
authority. The MND strives to acquire a reasonable portion of financial resources
via administrative communication and legislative negotiation based on its national
defense administration and the priority of its projects.

( Ⅰ ) Analysis of Financial Resource Acquisition

1. Comparison of the Overall Central Government Budget and Defense Budget
over the Past Decade

The scale of our defense budget in the past decade (from 2002 to 2011)
was between NT$250 billion and NT$330 billion, representing between
15.52% and 19.51% of the overall central government budget. This shows
that although our national finance was impacted by the global financial
crisis and adjustments were made to administration priority, the defense
budget will continue to represent a substantial proportion of the overall
central government budget, because national defense is the cornerstone of
national security. The Ministry of National Defense will continue to make
appropriate plans for resources within its budget based on the concept of
“effective utilization and maximizing benefits,” so as to ensure that the
Armed Forces’ capabilities do not fall, while it continues to complete overall

Giving consideration to both national security and the public’s right to
know, and in accordance with the “Classified National Security Information
Protection Act,” “Enforcement Rules of the Classified National Security
Information Protection Act” and “Guidelines for Categorization and
Ranking of Military and National Defense Classified Information,” the
Ministry of National Defense draws a clear line between “non-confidential”
and “confidential” budgets based on the principle of “minimizing the scope
of confidentiality and maximizing information disclosure” according to
project contents and characteristics, hoping to protect the public’s right to
know by meeting requirements of the “Freedom of Government Information
Law.” Figure 6-2 shows a gradual decrease in the percentage of confidential
budgets from 17.72% to 8.25% in the past decade, illustrating the substantial

effectiveness of making national defense budgets transparent.

3. Structural Analysis of the Defense Budget over the Past Decade

Priorities of defense budget allocations over the past decade in accordance
with policy guidance (defense budget allocations in three categories over
the past decade are as shown in Figure 6-3) include legally required for
active personnel, proper maintenance of combat equipment, and continued
acquisition of main armaments. Other requirements are satisfied based on
the national defense administration when there are remaining resources
from the priorities. This arrangement enables the proper allocation of
limited financial resources for the effective support of defense readiness
preparations. Regular expenditure cut down and practical planning have
been adopted in response to the policy for an all volunteer force; budgets
will be gradually increased as the Armed Forces takes further steps towards
voluntarism.

( Ⅱ ) Rational Budgeting and Allocation

1. Utilizing Financial Management Functions to Properly Allocate Resources

(1) Financial Supply Forecast

The Ministry of National Defense’s financial supply forecasts were
based on a conventional single variable linear model before 2006.
After making continuous improvements, a systematic dynamic
model was adopted in 2007 for subsequent financial supply forecasts;
the model refers to mid-term budgets approved by the Executive
Yuan and considers the nation’s overall economic situation, the
government’s financial condition, debt and administrative priorities
for the forecast of mid- to long-term financial resources that can
be acquired. Results of the model focus on trends and patterns of
long-term forecasts, which are consistent with characteristics of
force building – long-term, comprehensive and continual. Data of
the model is revised along with trends of the economy, financial
structure and government policy; favorable results have been
obtained from forecasts as they were verified by actual financial
supply over the years.

(2) Defense Financial Resource Allocation

The main objective of defense financial resource allocation and


178


-----

中華民國壹百年

國防報告書

utilization is to satisfy requirements of force development and
defense readiness missions. Considering the limitation of defense
financial resources, the Ministry of National Defense first allocates
its budget to satisfy personnel overheads in coordination with
the Executive Yuan’s mid-term budget preparing principles and
guidance, followed by basic operational requirements of its units,
project funding and maintaining current capabilities. Finally, based
on the flexibility of its budget, the MND adds new administrative
requirements. Furthermore, to strengthen the consistency of
budgeting and execution and to bring out maximum effects of
resource utilization, financial audits and joint reviews are regularly
conducted to gain an in-depth understanding of budgeting and actual
execution in its subordinate units, to review the appropriateness
of implementation results and budgets of its investment projects,
to reduce inappropriate resource investment, and to increase the
flexibility of its budget; this information is fed back as reference
for budgeting of target years and allows the suitable adjustment of
budget allocation on an annual basis.

2. Defense Budget and Administrative Priorities of 2011

The defense budget in 2011 was NT$294.58 billion, in which NT$139.98
billion was allocated for personnel maintenance, NT$68.45 billionwas
allocated for operational maintenance, NT$81.67 billion was allocated for
military investments, while other expenses accounted for the remaining
NT$4.46 billion. Allocation ratios are shown in Figure 6-5. Administrative
priorities are briefly described as follows:

(1) Strengthening both Joint Operation Capabilities and Disaster Relief
Performance:

A total of 13 types of joint operation exercises and training,
including the “Han Kuang Exercise,” will be implemented in 2011,
and all disaster relief missions will be carried out in all seriousness,
thus building armed forces that can “carry out disaster relief during
peacetime and engage in combat during wartime.”

(2) Enhancing Logistics Support Capacity, Ensuring Armaments
Serviceability:

A “precise, rapid and effective” logistic management mechanism
was established to integrate logistics information of the Armed

Forces, and utilize overall planning, control and readiness functions
to effectively support operational requirements

(3) Integrating Technology Research and Development to Realize SelfReliant National Defense:

To drive development of defense technology industries, the
“Executive Committee for the Development and Promotion of
Defense Science and Technology” coordinated the Ministry of
Economic Affairs and National Science Council in planning the
“Defense Technology Development Plan.” In addition, industrial
cooperation mechanisms are utilized to integrate national defense
and industrial cooperation requirements, thereby achieving the
objectives to support force buildup and defense readiness, as well as
industrial development.

(4) Continuous Development of New Weapons to Demonstrate
Determination for Self-Defense:

In accordance with the Force Buildup Program of the Armed Forces,
which focuses on enhancing joint operation capabilities, major
military investments projects implemented in 2011 include “Patriot
Missile System,” “New Attack Helicopter,” “P-3C Long Range Fixed
Wing Anti-Submarine Aircraft,” “E-2T Performance Enhancement,”
IDF Fighter Performance Enhancement” and “New Generation
Missile Boat Mass Production.”

(5) Emphasis on Defense Talent Cultivation, Creating a High Quality
Education Environment:

Military servicemen are encouraged to further their education
either full-time or on-the-job. Military academies participate in
international military academic seminars and exchanges to enhance
their teaching quality and performance; these endeavors supported
with certification and evaluation mechanisms allow the further
improvement of overall human resource quality.

(6) Planning Force Restructuring, Promoting Voluntarism:

To build a national defense force that is “small but superb, strong and
smart,” plans were made for force restructuring (Jingtsui Program).
Furthermore, a gradual approach was adopted for the transition
of military service systems, so that the volunteer force will grow

sequentially each year and finally achieve the policy objective of
“voluntarism.”

(7) Reshaping Intangible Combat Capabilities, Establishing Proper
Military Ethics:

Emphasis is placed on encouraging military ethics, the inheritance
of proper military ethics and encouraging patriotism. In addition, a
tightly knit mechanism for preventing misconduct was established
in response to the policy to “eliminate corruption and prevent
misconduct,” establishing proper military ethics in the Armed
Forces.

(8) Providing Full Benefits for Servicemen and their Dependents,
Bettering Service and Care Quality:

The legalization of benefits for military servicemen was implemented
to protect the rights and benefits of servicemen and their dependents;

the rebuilding of old quarters for military dependents have been
completed as scheduled and cultural preservation works have been
actively executed in accordance with the “Act for Rebuilding Old
Quarters for Military Dependents,” showing the diverse spirits of
ethnic groups .

II. Defense Financial Resource Management

Due to the immense size and complexity of the national defense system, units at each
level often face many uncertainties from annual budget compilation to actual budget
execution, resulting in fluctuations between budgeting and execution. Facing potential
risks, the Armed Forces has made great efforts to strengthen its financial management
abilities, measures adopted include establishing control mechanisms, redeveloping
workflows, on-site investigation and statistics analysis.

( Ⅰ ) Establishing Control Mechanisms to Enhance Budgeting
and Execution Performance:

National resources are limited, but the needs of political, economic, military and
psychological developments are limitless. In order to effectively utilize financial
resources, from an active perspective, this means integrating administrative
capabilities and budget management capabilities so that the administration can
produce conclusive effects; from a passive perspective, this means preventing waste,
inefficient or ineffective use of resources. Therefore, defense budgets requirements
are based on force buildup plans, after which a reasonable budget is allocated,
executed according to administrative priorities and project timetables, which is
implemented at different levels according to division of authority and responsibility.
A budget control mechanism is established for comparing current progress to past
budget execution situations, conducting reviews, making adjustments and feeding
back budgeting information, so as to effectively enhance resource utilization and
achieve the objective of “coherent budgeting and execution.”

( Ⅱ ) Redeveloping the Accounting Workflow to Increase Fund
Utilization Benefits:

Impacts of global financial crisis and economic recession resulted in a government
deficit. As a part of the administrative system, the Armed Forces gives full support
to the effective distribution of government resources and flexible fund allocation


182

and utilization. Thus, the Armed Forces actively cooperated with the Ministry of
Finance in putting funds held in custody into the treasury for centralized payment,
and reviewed its accounting procedures; in principle, payments are made directly to
the accounts of creditors by the Taipei Disbursement Office, Ministry of Finance,
taking the responsibility of holding cash off the hands of military units and reducing
payment risks, thereby enhancing the government’s financial resource utilization
effectiveness. Furthermore, “Government Budget Accounting (GBA)” was gradually
adopted in accordance with the “Accounting System of Ordinary Government
Activities for Central Government General Fund” promulgated by the DirectorateGeneral of Budget, Accounting and Statistics; accounting affairs reform projects
will be implemented in the future based on missions and characteristics of military
units, so as to perfect the accounting system, strengthen accounting management, and
further improve the government’s accounting quality.

( Ⅲ ) Establishing a Cost System to Fully Utilize Management
Functions:

The Armed Forces’ various administrative affairs are realized via the execution
of annual budgets, besides compiling accounting records and financial statements
required for external reports, and producing cost records required for internal
management functions, proper utilization of the data can provide references for
costs of each stage of the “Armed Forces Plans Budgeting System.” Therefore,
the establishment of a cost system has always been an emphasis of the Ministry of
National Defense; for example, using education and training cost reports of military
academies to improve the positioning of military education and gain competitive
advantages. With regard to maintenance cost analysis, accounting information of
maintenance factories in military bases are analyzed, including manpower allocation,
maintenance capacity, cost control and resource integration, to increase the reference
value of decision-making and management. In the future, on-site surveys will be
conducted to gather actual costs and further establish standard costs, fully utilizing
financial resource management functions for national defense.

( Ⅳ ) Consolidating Internal Control Mechanisms, Reforming
Established Practices

The Armed Forces currently has as many as 243 units executing budgets. To
utilize the early warning function of financial management, the Armed Forces has
established a strict and effective “auditing network” to integrate internal audits of


Part 3 National Defense Capabilities

Chapter 6 National Defense Resources


183


-----

its subordinate units; the “internal auditing network” consists of mechanisms in four
aspects: “internal audit,” “cash inspection,” “self-examination” and “education and
training,” and emphasizes on the establishment of internal control and preventive
auditing functions. Furthermore, an efficient, effective and economic internal auditing
mechanism was created via work simplification, authority delegation and hierarchical
responsibilities to help units utilize internal control functions, strengthen preventive
and continuous auditing, and prevent mistakes from reoccurring. In the future,
national defense policy will continue to be the basis on which better services will be
developed, providing useful information to decision-making associated with national
defense, and bringing out the full effects of defense financial resource management.

( Ⅴ ) Utilizing Statistics Functions, Implementing Administrative
Affairs

Defense statistics and analysis will be carried out in coordination with requirements of
military affairs, with “administrative affairs” as its core and driven by “management.”
The “National Defense Statistical Information Service Network” was established
to assist the “gathering and management of statistics,” “compilation, report and
utilization of statistics,” “special statistics analysis,” “official duties statistics,”
“annual statistical reports” and “statistical indicators,” showing variables that affect
results of the Armed Forces’ policy, analyzing strengths and weaknesses of each
policy and predicting future trends, thus generating valuable quantified information.
In addition, in terms of enhancing the precision of defense budgeting, the analysis
report “personnel maintenance cost estimation model establishment” was completed,
and utilizes the estimation model for calculation and scenario analysis to evaluate a
reasonable budget scale for personnel maintenance. With regard to the “voluntarism”
policy, questionnaire surveys were conducted to understand its effect on recruitment,
training and retention; basic information of volunteer soldiers, important statistics
and survey parameters will be used as reference for the implementation of an allvolunteer force.

Section 3 Armament Readiness

The armaments system management mechanism is utilized to import advanced
technologies and optimize investments based on requirements of force development,
so as to satisfy requirements of the Armed Forces’ defense operations. To integrate
national economic development with livelihood industries, “acquisition strategy,
technology strategy and logistics strategy” are supported with procurement,
construction and facility, human resource and financial resource strategies, thereby
achieving the objective of “all-out defense”.

I. Acquisition Strategy Planning

Utilizing advanced management techniques and a robust acquisition management
system, the acquisition strategy is to gain maximum benefits using the most
appropriate cost and shortest amount of time, under the premise that armaments
acquisition of the Armed Forces satisfies its operational requirements and that policy
guidance is observed.

( Ⅰ ) Military Investment Projects

In accordance with operating procedures of military investment projects, departments
for commard compile “requirement reports,” departments for policy compile “analysis
reports” and departments for armament formulate “investment outline plans” based
on policy guidance for innovation and asymmetry, results of the “Quadrennial
Defense Review” and future combat requirements for short-, mid- and long-range
joint capabilities. Military investment projects aim to maximize force building
benefits with limited defense resources so as to ensure national security.

A total of 90 major military investment proposals for 2012 were completed in 2010;
the proposals are reviewed in 2011 and accepted based on the priority of capability
requirements and anticipated financial resource acquisition in 2012, continuing the
buildup of high quality forces.

( Ⅱ ) Transformation of the Chung Shan Institute of Science and
Technology (CSIST)

In order to enhance defense technology research capabilities, expand the transfer of
dual-use technologies to the private sectors, and achieve the win-win situation of
“strengthening self-reliant national defense” and “vitalizing the economy,” the MND
plans to transform the CSIST into an “administrative legal person,” with the MND
acting as its supervisory agency, and hopes to recruit outstanding talents and enhance
organizational performance via the adoption of corporate management and relaxation
of various systems; benefits that can be obtained from this transformation are as
follows:

1. The CSIST’s main mission remains to develop national defense technologies,
with the MND acting as its supervisory agency and a board of directors
to oversee its operations. Priorities of the CSIST are to support combat
readiness, exercises and training missions of the Armed Forces, so as to
bring out the full effects of national defense investments.

2. Enhanced defense technology research capabilities, operational flexibility
and implementation efficiency of the CSIST reduces system development
time and satisfies operational requirements of the Armed Forces.

3. Benefits the Armed Forces and forward-looking technological research, and
enhances response capabilities of technological research by establishing
flexible human resources, budget and procurement systems.

4.Expanded transfer of dual-use technologies to the private sector drives
development of national defense technology industries, while giving
consideration to self-reliant national defense and economic and livelihood
developments.

( Ⅲ ) International Armament Exchange

By attending academic symposiums, seminars and conferences, engaging in academic
exchanges and visits, and taking part in technology forums and exhibitions, exchange
and cooperation projects have been actively negotiated with foreign institutions
(units or laboratories) based on the principles of “equality,” “mutually beneficial” and
“resource sharing,” hoping to jointly expand information exchange and cooperation
opportunities associated with defense technology research, development, testing and
evaluation. Operation modes will be gradually transformed to meet requirements of
our national situation, thereby establishing a professional, international armaments

organization that can enhance the Armed Forces’ joint operation capabilities. For
advanced weapons that cannot be domestically developed, armament exchange will
be enhanced with advanced nations. Weapons research and development capacities
of the ROC Armed Forces will be gradually developed through prioritization of
technological cooperation and transfers, complemented by off-the-shelf procurement
as a secondary option.

The “US-Taiwan Defense Industry Conference” was held on September 27[th]~29[th],
2009 and October 3[rd]~5[th], 2010 in Charlottesville, Virginia and Cambridge,
Maryland, respectively. The conferences yielded concrete results to US-Taiwan
relations, the mutual trust mechanism, acquiring major procurements, absorbing
international disaster relief experiences, and enhancing the disaster relief capabilities
of the Armed Forces.

( Ⅳ ) Research and Development

Development of weapon systems is based on the principle of “adequate, good and
better,” and emphasize on “innovative and asymmetrical” capabilities, establishing
precise, rapidly responsive, mobile and effective deterrence capabilities. Joint
platforms, either common or interoperable, are built based on the systematic concept
of “one equipment, applicable to tri-services, and multiple effects,” benefiting
joint operations and logistics. Furthermore, capabilities of domestic industries,
government, academia and research institutions are integrated for the development
of key technologies and weapon systems, such as strategic unmanned aircraft, long
range precision guidance missiles and EMP, gradually building modern armed forces
that satisfy defense requirements of our nation.

Establishment of a strategic alliance and division of labor, in which dual-use
technologies are transferred to the private sector, further developed by the private
sector and contributed back to the military; this model supports components
development, joint development, and fully utilizes resources of the private sector.
Technology transfers or the enhancement of key technology development capabilities
speed up the process that cutting-edge armaments are developed and acquired.
In 2010, 15 basic and key technology research and development projects were
completed and 25 armament development projects were implemented, actively
enhancing defense technology research and development capabilities, developing
defense technology industries, and fully satisfying the operational requirements of the
Armed Forces.

( Ⅴ ) Production and Manufacturing

Production and manufacturing are based on the principles “core establishment,
capacity integration, strategic alliances, and division of labor.” Cooperative
production, technology transfer, and outsourced production are used to establish or
enhance key production capabilities, and fully utilize private resources for division of
labor. This elevates the quality of military goods and accelerates the production and
deployment of armaments.

Some 11 thousand categories of weapon systems, equipment, missiles, artillery and
ammunition were produced in 2010, total output value worth over NT$24.7 billion.
Up to May 2011, production of over 2,500 categories of military goods has been
completed according to schedule, and some 12 thousand categories are estimated
to be produced for the entire year, output value reaching over NT$32.8 billion.
This demonstrates the active enhancement of autonomous production capacity and
effectively strengthens the Armed Forces’ overall capabilities.

國防報告書


( Ⅵ ) Armament Acquisition

Armaments acquisition is based on the principle of “prioritizing domestic production,
and using foreign procurement for support.” Foreign procurements are made along
with requests for industrial cooperation and technology transfer, so as to enhance
the Armed Forces’ technology research and production capabilities, support defense
industries, and achieve self-reliant national defense.

The principle “unified procurement of common equipment of the tri-services”
aims to achieve economies of scale, gaining better prices via purchases in larger
quantities. Military requirements, military goods and services, such as general facility
construction, transportation and military base cleaning are either procured, rented or
constructed domestically in accordance with the “Government Procurement Act,”
using the resource outsourcing policy to vitalize domestic industries. In addition,
resource outsourcing is expanded via private operation of public establishments
and military goods repair and maintenance, fostering domestic military industries,
strengthening self-reliant national defense, and vitalizing the economy.

II. Technology Strategy Planning

In consideration of future combat requirements and after evaluating existing
technological capabilities, core capabilities are established, armaments resources are
integrated, and a blueprint of defense technology developments is laid out to support
force buildup and defense readiness missions.

( Ⅰ ) Development of Defense Technologies

In response to future combat requirements, an integrated evaluation is conducted on
defense technology development capabilities, a blueprint of short-, mid- and longterm defense technology developments is drawn out, and international technology
cooperation and exchanges are expanded to establish technical capacities and
cultivate defense technology talents.

With academic cooperation, 84 projects worth a total of NT$116 million for
developing advanced weaponry and key technologies, including “advanced
information and electronic technology,” were contracted to domestic technology
research institutions in 2010. In 2011, 77 academic cooperation projects with
an estimated amount of NT$115 million, including “sensor imaging system
development,” were approved. Besides planning 7 major fields, including “high

frequency microwave technology,” “energy conservation and carbon reduction
(alternative energy)” will also be included as a focus of the Armed Forces’ forwardlooking research, so as to conform to future research trends. Research results will not
only be provided as a basis for developing key technologies of weapon systems, but
also expand the scope of domestic defense technology developments, benefiting the
elevation of overall technology levels in Taiwan.

( Ⅱ ) Development of Defense Industries

National defense and industrial cooperation requirements are integrated via
operations of the “MOEA MND Industrial Cooperation Policy Guidance Council”
and “Executive Committee for Industrial Cooperation,” and focus on overall logistics
and maintenance capabilities for armaments. Industrial cooperation projects acquired
via foreign procurements of military investments over the years have accumulated to
over US$7.3 billion.

The “Ministry of National Defense Regulations on Industrial Cooperation” amended
on November 10[th], 2010 stipulates “operating procedures of industrial cooperation,”

and added a “list of requirements of industrial cooperation,” effectively integrating
defense requirements and enhancing the effectiveness of industrial cooperation
funds. Ongoing major industrial cooperation projects include the Navy’s “P-3C Antisubmarine Aircraft Depot Level Logistics and Maintenance Plan” and the Army’s
“Apache Logistics and Maintenance Technology Transfer,” effectively enhancing
armaments maintenance capabilities and strengthening self-reliant national defense.

To establish a domestic supply system for military factories and develop defense
industries, as of May 2011, 372 satellite factories were established and provide
over 11,000 types of key components for armaments. This initiative improves the
availability of military equipment and creates market opportunities for industries;
total amount of outsourcing was NT$9.2 billion in 2009, NT$8.3 billion in 2010, and
is expected to reach NT$9 billion in 2011.

( Ⅲ ) Civil-Military Interoperational Technology Development

Developments focus on “key technologies,” “revitalizing traditional industries,”
“outsourcing military goods” and “technical services,” tightly linking defense and
livelihood technologies together to enhance industrial competitiveness and achieve
self-reliant national defense.

In the last 5 years the Chung Shan Institute of Science and Technology (CSIST)
carried out 690 dual-use technology product development projects and technology
transfers to domestic firms under the MOEA Technology Development Program,
in which projects acquired and applied patents come to 292, driving investments
of over NT$19.1 billion from the industrial sector, and creating an output value
of over NT$86.4 billion. In addition, the CSIST undertook international technical
service projects in coordination with the National Space Organization and Academia
Sinica, and made significant contributions to international cooperation and academic
exchanges, benefiting the improvement of our national image.

III. Logistics Strategy Planning

In accordiance with the policy of self-reliant national defense, “full life cycle
system management” is adopted as a framework and supports with “supply chain
management” and “strategic alliances with industries” under the premise of satisfying
operational requirements and maintaining reliable defense capabilities. An optimal
corporate operation mode is applied in coordination with capabilities of domestic
industries, so as to reduce investment cost, enhance logistics support efficiency,
increase overall investment benefits, suitably support combat forces, and satisfy
requirements for maintaining capabilities.

( Ⅰ ) Full Life Cycle System Management

A complete management system and process has been established with regard to
the research, development, production, procurement and deployment stages of
armaments, so as to strengthen modeled management. Planning, maintenance, and
management mechanisms will be developed, and logistical support capacities will be
established to enable effective management and cost control throughout the full life
cycles of weapon systems, thereby achieving maximum availability.

Based on cost considerations over the full life cycle of weapon systems and in
coordination with resource outsourcing plans, supervision and evaluation of the


192


-----

中華民國壹百年

國防報告書

“planning, development, production, deployment, maintenance and retirement”
stages of operation will be executed with weapon system specific management
methods. Furthermore, regulations on weapon acquisition project control, progress
authentication, acceptance and payment and supervision of contract performance
is promulgated; controlled armaments projects worth over NT$1 billion between
2009 and 2011 reached 41 projects, effectively managing implementation results of
military investment (technology research) projects.

( Ⅱ ) Supply Chain Management

“Logistics management” and “supply chain management” concepts of private
industries and foreign arms sales mechanisms will be applied to effectively undertake
resource planning, resource acquisition, production, maintenance, transportation
and allocation operations, in which modeled management and modeled data will be
utilized to establish acquisition plans for different materials.

Long-term supply and demand channels will be established with suppliers in the form
of military sales, commercial sales, basic order agreements, and order contracts for
the spare parts of assembly and accessories for weapons systems. General supplies
and expendable materials will be jointly contracted or bulk purchases made to
simultaneously simplify contractual management personnel, reduce inventory size,
and improve maintenance and repair efficiency.

( Ⅲ ) Strategic Alliances with Industries

In accordance with plans to establish defense technologies and industrial technologies,
the Armed Forces will expand domestic and foreign industry cooperation and
catalyze the integration of strategic alliances, technology transfers and funding
between contractors, manufacturers, and domestic public and private sector entities
(including military units). As a result, the ROC Armed Forces will be able to enhance
the industry foundation of defense self-reliance, establish interconnected industry
cooperation support networks, lower life cycle costs, and improve logistical operation
efficiency.

Research projects adopt “performance-based logistics” and apply best practices of
corporate operations; pilot projects include the Army’s TH-67 helicopter, the Navy’s
P-3C anti-submarine aircraft, the Air Force’s aircraft tires, and Combined Logistics
Command’s medium tactical vehicles. Non-core maintenance work will be gradually

contracted out to the private sector to act as integrated contractors for weapon system
support, which will undertake various logistical maintenance and support operations.
Domestic industry participation in defense affairs will be fully encouraged to lower
weapon maintenance costs, increasing weapon readiness, and enhancing economic
benefits of domestic industries.

IV. Procurement Management and Planning

( Ⅰ ) Transparent Procurements, Promoting Integrity

Defense procurement is an important means for supporting the Armed Forces’
defense readiness and preparations, and also a part of government procurements.
Management of such procurements must therefore abide by the government’s policy
of anti-corruption and integrity; an “open, transparent” procurement environment
must be established with an emphasis on enhancing administrative efficiency.
Furthermore, under the Government Procurement Act’s requirements on the
professional competencies of procurement personnel, the Ministry of National
Defense will continue to offer professional training courses, and implement the
procurement personnel background management system and incentive measures, thus
enhancing the professional competencies of procurement personnel and quality of
procurement related decision-making.

( Ⅱ ) Statistics of Procurements

The Armed Forces’ procurement is based on the principles of “establishing selfreliant national defense,” “supporting domestic industries” and “prioritizing domestic
firms”; for goods that must be procured from overseas, the manufacturer will be
required to engage in industrial cooperation, thereby elevating technology levels of
domestic industries. A total of over 10,100 procurements were carried out by the
Armed Forces in 2010, total amount exceeding NT$200 billion; in which over 10,000
procurement is domestic and over 100 purchases were foreign (including military
sales). Up to May 2011 a total of over 4,600 procurements had been completed by the
Armed Forces, total amount exceeding NT$19 billion; in which over 4,600 purchases
were domestic and 8 procurements were foreign (including military sales).

V. Construction and Military Property Management

( Ⅰ ) Improving Living Facilities, Implementing Energy
Conservation and Environmental Protection

To implement the policy of “voluntarism,” the Ministry of National Defense surveyed
old military camps awaiting renovation (138 bases) and has begun rebuilding 10
camps since 2010; the bases will be completed in 2017. Subsequent projects will be
implemented based on the financial condition of the Fund for Rebuilding Old Military
Camps and the principle of “overall planning, yearly execution,” so as to better the
living quality of servicemen.

The rebuilding of old military camps is outsourced in accordance with the resource
outsourcing policy. Also, the MND is actively building military camps with green
buildings in coordination with the nation’s environmental protection policy, applying
energy conservation techniques to protect the ecological environment, reducing the
impact on earth’s environment and waste of resources. The “Construction Auditing
Implementation Plan” was promulgated by the Ministry of National Defense for after
constructions are contracted in accordance with relevant regulations, including the
Public Construction Commissions “Operating Rules for Construction Surveillance
Units,” so as to refine and execute operations according to law, and effectively
supervise and strengthen the Armed Forces’ construction quality management.

Safety inspections were conducted in military camps, Navy and Air Force Bases, and
fuel and ammunition storages in coordination with the “Geology Act” promulgated
on December 8[th], 2010. Experts and scholars are invited to assist with on-site
evaluations for any sites that are found with safety risks. Under the premise of
not affecting defense readiness, reinforcement measures are taken or relocation is
considered to protect the safety of personnel deployed there.

( Ⅱ ) Continuing the Release of Military Bases, Vitalizing
National Land Utilization

Transfer and release of land occupied by the Armed Forces are carried out in
coordination with the government’s major policy and national land planning, tourism
development requirements on Kinmen, Matzu and Penghu, and implementation
concepts of the Jingstui Program. Reviews are conducted based on the principle
of “merging small military camps into large ones, and Army, Navy and Air Force

encamped in one military camp,” and land is transferred to the National Property
Administration or other government agencies according to operating procedures for
Armed Forces base transfer (release) inspections. A total of over 2,500ha of land
was released as of May 2011, and greatly contributes to the expansion of domestic
demand and vitalization of economic development.

In consideration of land requirements of local development, environment protection
parks and disaster relief missions, military camps with low utilization were reviewed
and provided for use by local governments, achieving the full utilization of national
property. At present, 18 sites (roughly 152.1ha) are being reviewed for being lent
to local governments for greening, providing recreational facilities, and settling
community residents.

The Ministry of National Defense completed surveys of military camps in all 25
counties (cities) according to the timetable set by the Executive Yuan’s “Plan for
Sorting Out and Vitalizing State-owned Real Estate,” and will handle subsequent
matters according to review results of the Executive Yuan’s supervision group after
being reported by the National Property Administration.

Section 4 National Defense and People’s
Livelihood

In consideration of both defense technology and economic development, the Ministry
of National Defense has driven upgrades of domestic industries and macroeconomic
development based on the government’s policy to “outsource defense resources”;
by encouraging the private sector to participate in public constructions; private
capital and energy have been utilized along with government budgets to effectively
drive economic development. Additionally, in response to the government’s energy
conservation and carbon reduction policy, the ROC Armed Forces conducted full
reviews of policy, budgets and operations, hoping to encourage servicemen to develop
the habit of energy conservation under the premise that it does not affect defense
readiness and their normal lives, jointly protecting the environment so as to achieve
the objective that defense developments can also look after people’s livelihood.

I. Resource Outsourcing

The defense budget comes from tax payments by citizens; thus, defense constructions
are obligated to be combined with economic constructions. By outsourcing defense
resources armaments can be domestically developed, produced and maintained;
the procurement of general military supplies can be outsourced to private firms
or acquired from the private sector; the direct investment of defense resources
encourages domestic firms to engage in defense affairs, thereby establishing selfreliant national defense, elevating domestic technology levels, vitalizing market
economics, and creating employment opportunities.

( Ⅰ ) Concept and Planning

Plans for outsourcing defense resources are based on the fact that increasing the ratio
of defense budgets used domestically will effectively increase the private sector’s
willingness and ability to participate in defense affairs, and that it will assist with the
nation’s industrial and economic development. Besides outsourcing general military
supplies to domestic firms, non-essential maintenance capacity of current armaments
will also be entirely outsourced. Requirements of new armaments that can be satisfied
domestically will not be outsourced to foreign countries, and the Armed Forces will
not establish such capacity as well. Defense resource allocation adjustments are
based on 3 principles – reducing military affairs, reducing foreign procurements and

expanding resource outsourcing, thereby boosting economic development.

( Ⅱ ) Implementation Results

Resource outsourcing was planned and began implementation in 2002. Statistics
of the amount of military goods outsourced grew sequentially each year from the
NT$55.8 billion in 2003 to NT$87.6 billion in 2010, execution rate reaching 101.14%
(as shown in Table 6-8). Major long-term outsourcing projects are as follows:

1. Large missile boat construction
2. Small and medium tactical vehicles
3. Frequency-hopping radio production and maintenance
4. Eight-wheel armored vehicle production and maintenance
5. Strategic commercial maintenance
6. Private operation of publicly owned military factories

**_Table 6-8 Resource Outsourcing Amount in 2010~2011_**

Year Target Actual Outsourcing Amount

2010 NT$86.4 billion NT$87.6 billion

2011 NT$90.6 billion Ongoing

( Ⅲ ) Future Developments

1. Implementation of strategic commercial maintenance:

The Armed Forces will pick up the pace of commercial maintenance of
Army equipment according to its overall plans for strategic commercial
maintenance of military aircrafts and vessels, and establish long-term
partnerships with domestic contractors.

2. Prioritizing domestic procurement over foreign procurement and expanding
outsourcing of military goods production and maintenance:

The achievement and growth of resource outsourcing goals depend on

the domestic acquisition and maintenance of armaments. The MND has
ordered that the Army, Navy, Air Force, Combine Logistics Command
and Armaments Bureau set maximum foreign procurement amounts and
minimum domestic maintenance and procurement amounts based on current
implementation results, using this as a means to control and encourage
domestic procurements among subordinate units.

II. Promoting Private Participation Infrastructure

In recent years, private investments in infrastructure, corporate management concepts,
and improvement of public service quality have developed into international trends.
In response to future organizational functions and requirements of force buildup,
the MND has reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of encouragement measures,
reducing unnecessary consumption of human, material and financial resources for
logistics, and vitalizing the utilization and maintenance of property and military

According to the “Ministry of National Defense Implementation Plan for Promotion
of Private Participation,” which was formulated based on guidance provided by
the “Executive Yuan Committee for the Promotion of Private Participation in
Infrastructure Projects”: the Ministry of National Defense and its subordinate
agencies (units) should outsource the operation of items stipulated in the “Statute for
Promoting Private Participation in Public Construction” to private institutions, so as
to reduce operation costs, boost social and economic development, and thus achieve a
win-win situation for the military and civilians.

( Ⅱ ) Implementation Status and Results

Three operation outsourcing contracts were signed in 2010, including the “Tri-service
General Hospital Shopping Street ROT,” in which private investments increased by
NT$130 million, implementation results are as follows:

1. Projects implemented in coordination with the Executive Yuan’s policy to
promote private participation are divided into “medical and health care” and
“tourism and recreation”; there are currently 27 ongoing projects including
the “Tri-service General Hospital Chinese Medicine Pharmacy Outsourced
Operation,” private investment amount accumulated to roughly NT$900
million.

2. With regard to promoting private participation, to enhance the competencies
and experience sharing of personnel in the Ministry of National Defense and
subordinate units, 2 batches of educational training and lectures were offered
for a total of 168 participants.

3. The National Defense Medical Center and Tri-service General Hospital took
part in ratings of the Executive Yuan’s 8[th] Golden Thumb Awards, and won
excellence awards under “government agencies and teams.”

4. The 27 projects that have completed contract signing will continue to be
implemented and controlled in 2011; items that can be released to private
enterprises will be planned in accordance with policy.

Section 1 National Defense Education

I. All-Out Defense Education

The “All-Out Defense Education Act” consists of five education axes – “international
situation,” “national defense policy,” “all-out defense,” “defense mobilization” and
“defense technology.” “Inter-departmental coordination mechanisms” are used to
integrate resources and capabilities of government agencies and the society, and
implement in-depth school education, teacher cultivation, defense relic preservation,
and diverse support activities. The purpose is to make national security concepts a
part of everyday life, to popularize national defense knowledge, and to build mutual
trust and common views of “all-out defense.”

( Ⅰ ) Deepening Defense Concepts via School Education:

The Ministry of National Defense together with the Ministry of Education completed
and announced the “Implementation Regulations for All-Out Defense Education
Curriculum for All Levels of Schools” on May 25[th], 2010, using it as a basis for
promoting all-out defense education in all levels of schools. Starting in the 2010
academic year, all-out defense education courses in high (vocational) schools have
provided 2 credits; “aptitude workshops for middle and elementary school teachers”
have been implemented as a means for enhancing teacher cultivation and training.
In order to let our youth experience the importance of defense to national security,
8 summer camps including the “Kinmen Summer Camp” were held in 3 batches, in
which there were more than 2,900 participants. Furthermore, support was provided
to the “live-fire experience activity for high (vocational) school students” in hopes of
building a national defense consensus and developing defense skills.

( Ⅱ ) Improving On-the-job Education to Drive Defense
Developments

In accordance with the “Regulations on the Implementation of All-Out Defense
Education in Government Agencies (Institutions),” 95 qualified teachers of the
National Defense University were selected to provide on-the-job education for staffs
of the 63 central government agencies, municipalities and county (city) governments;
a total of 469 lessons were offered in 2010 to 2011, and participants reached 43,995

persons. Additionally, e-learning courses were offered on the “e-learning network”
in cooperation with the Civil Service Development Institute to accelerate on-the-job
education results of civil servants.

( Ⅲ ) Promoting Social Education to Strengthen Danger
Awareness

To let the public gain an extensive understanding of force buildup and defense
preparation results of the Armed Forces, “Defense Journey of Discovery” activities
are held in coordination with military camp open days based on the principle of
not affecting operational duties and mission execution. The “Defense Journey of
Discovery” was held 14 times in 2010 with a total of 237,644 participants, effectively
enhancing positive interaction with the public, arousing patriotic thoughts and
establishing national identification. Furthermore, invitations for articles, posters,
animations and teaching plans and online Q&A activities related to all-out defense
education will be further expanded, and support was given to Hualien County’s “2010
Pacific International Tourism Festival,” Taitung County’s “National High School
Games,” Taipei City’s “2010 5-in-1 Campaign” and Tamkang University’s “All-Out
Defense and Military Weapons Exhibition,” planting the concept of all-out defense
deep to people’s hearts. (See Appendices 7-1 and 7-2)

Section 2 Defense Mobilization

The Ministry of National Defense acts as a secretary for the “Executive Yuan
Mobilization Meeting,” and integrates related agencies and all level governments
in the joint implementation of psychological, manpower, material and economic,
financial, transportation, hygiene, technological and military mobilization preparations
in accordance with the “Act of All-Out Defense Mobilization Preparation.” These
preparations are for supporting disaster relief during peacetime in accordance with
the Disaster Prevention and Protection Act, and military operations and contingency
response during mobilization stages. Furthermore, mobilization preparations are
propagated in different level schools, social organizations and government agencies
(institutions) according to the “All-Out Defense Education Act,” building an all-out
defense consensus and allowing all-out defense to become a reality.

I. Strengthening the Defense Mobilization
Mechanism

The Ministry of National Defense established a three-level mobilization system in
accordance with Article 8 of the “Act of All-Out Defense Mobilization Preparation”;
the system consists of “meetings” and “plans.” The three levels of the mobilization
system are namely the Executive Yuan All-Out Defense Mobilization Preparation
Meeting, Mobilization Preparation Meetings in each aspect, and municipality and
county/city government mobilization preparation meetings. Each meeting adopts a
cross-departmental, cross-committee collegiate system, one level guiding operations
of another. Municipal, county and city governments periodically hold three in one
meetings (mobilization preparation, capability integration and disaster relief) to
establish a coordination, communication and cooperation mode.

To strengthen the functions of each meeting and to solidify the legal foundation,
the “Regulations on Disaster Relief Preparations and Contingency Response in
Coordination with the Civil Defense and All-Out Defense Mobilization Preparation
System” amended on January 31[st], 2011 specifies joint operation mechanisms of the
three in one meeting, so as to gain accurate control over resources within jurisdiction,
strengthen coordination and communication performance between the government
and military, and accelerate disaster response; as shown in Figures 7-1 and 7-2.

support from central mobilization agencies, municipalities, county/city governments,
and public and private enterprises, the Ministry of National Defense supervises
periodic surveys conducted by municipalities and county/city governments on human
and material resources that can be mobilized within their jurisdiction, compiling
statistics on mobilization and support capacities of the entire nation, and utilizing
information systems to accurately, rapidly integrate and dispatch mobilization
capabilities.

In order to effectively integrate capabilities of areas of operations, capability
integration meetings at each level request statistics of human and material resources
within their jurisdiction from competent authorities every six months, and conduct
random inspections and re-inspections, validating the completion of military and
transportation mobilization preparations via preliminary supply-demand verification,
periodic requisition exercises, wartime budgeting procedures, and coordinating
requisition enforcement agencies. The total manpower mobilization capability
is 1.13 million persons, and requisition of military supplies by purchase include
240 items under 8 categories, including minerals, basic metals, machinery, fibers,
leather, plastic, cotton, chemical products, medical supplies, construction materials,
transportation tools and communication equipment; furthermore, requisition of 24

magistrates and city mayors. The exercises validate joint operation mechanisms of
the three in one meeting (mobilization preparation, capability integration and disaster
relief), and topics include mobilization, civil defense, disaster relief, emergency
medical care, infectious disease prevention and emergency response mechanisms to
nuclear accidents; compared with past exercises, significant progress was made in all
exercises of 2011.

( Ⅱ ) Military Mobilization (Tung Hsin) Exercises

The “Tung Hsin No.22” and “Tung Hsin No.23” mobilization exercises were
implemented in 2010 and 2011, and each was an improvement over its predecessor.
Various types of reserve forces and auxiliary military service troops are mobilized
across all districts of Taiwan, training topics include “issuing and delivering
mobilization orders”, “manpower and material mobilization”, “reserve troop
mobilization organization, recovery of combat capabilities, and execution of
homeland defense operations” and “production conversion for the mobilization of the
military supply industry,” and aim to validate the mobilization mechanism and the
results of reserve troop training.

IV. Improving Reserve Force Training

Personnel selection will be based on the principle of “on-site mobilization and
engagement,” as well as the expertise, age, physical condition and tactical force
positions. Educational training for reserve forces will be intensified to gain accurate
control over the whereabouts and combat skills of reserve servicemen. With
consideration to the organization and characteristics of various forces and annual
manpower requirements, reserve forces by battalion (or independent company) are
mustered for 5 to 7 days of training every other year for the “Tung Hsin Exercise”
and “general muster-calls.” A total of 662 batches of training for a total of 117,334
military reservists were implemented; the objective to secure force capabilities has
been achieved.

After the transition to “voluntarism” is complete, draft age men will receive 4 months
military training instead of serving 1 year compulsory military service, thus there
will be no lack of manpower for mobilization. Plans are for the 4 months of military
training to be combined with reserve force expertise, and divided into two stages –
“basic training” and “expertise training.” Trainees will become qualified combatants
once they complete training, and be added to the reserve force or the military

assisting duty corps. These forces will be periodically mustered for training to restore
their combat skills, and at the same time continue disaster relief practical training, so
as to meet requirements of disaster relief missions of reserve forces.

Ⅴ . Building Consensus on All-Out Defense

( Ⅰ ) Holding Academic Seminars

The Executive Yuan Mobilization Meeting held the academic seminar on “New
Concepts and Prospects of All-Out Defense Mobilization” for the first time in August
2010 to strengthen the public’s understanding of all-out defense mobilization, and
review current all-out defense mobilization methods and future directions. Attendees
of the seminar reached over 300 persons and included personnel from the Executive
Yuan, National Security Council and competent authorities of different mobilization
plans, directors of mobilization and disaster relief units in county/city governments,

and experts and scholars of related fields; recommendations were proposed and
deliberated on during the seminar, and greatly benefit subsequent mobilization
preparations.

( Ⅱ ) Annual Workshops for Mobilization Directors and Cadres

To enhance the coordination and cooperation between central government agencies
and county/city government mobilization systems, 4 workshops were offered for
“executive directors” and “mobilization cadres” of all-out defense mobilization
affairs in November 2010; over 700 persons participated in the workshops, including
directors and responsible staff of competent authorities of the central government’s
mobilization preparation plans, county/city mobilization meetings, and capability
integration meetings at different levels; for 2011 the workshops will be held in
October as scheduled. Policy explanations, special topic speeches, experience
sharing and visits during the workshops allowed mobilization directors and staffs to
understand laws and policy, benefiting the horizontal and vertical communication
between meetings at each level, further improving all-out defense mobilization
and contingency response mechanism, implementing all-out defense mobilization
preparations, and enhancing contingency response capabilities and the performance
of military maneuvers.

Section 1 Disaster Prevention and
Preparedness

To carry out disaster prevention and relief and combat training operations, the ROC
Armed Forces has cooperated with the competent authority in drafting amendments
to related laws and regulations, deployed personnel and equipment in coordination
with disaster prevention requirements, and modified the disaster prevention and relief
resource system to establish integrated disaster relief resources. Other measures
adopted to effectively strengthen disaster relief and protection capacity include war
gaming, professional disaster relief training, reviewing current facilities, utilizing
medical resources to aid community residents, reviewing the utilization of military
reservists for disaster relief, and continuing to carry out disaster prevention and relief
preparations.

I. Policy Guidance

The ROC Armed Forces has abided by the policy “disaster relief is akin to fighting
a battle,” “prepare for disasters in advance, deploy troops with an eye to disaster
preparedness, and ensure readiness for rescue operations” and “emphasize disaster
prevention over disaster relief, and prioritize disaster avoidance over disaster
prevention,” and revised action standards for disaster preparations and operations.
Each armed force has orders to actively coordinate and communicate with local
governments, to make disaster prevention and relief preparations, and immediately
engage in disaster relief whenever the need arises, so as to protect the lives and assets
of the people. The organizational structure of the ROC Armed Forces’ disaster relief
mechanisms and task forces is as shown in Figure 8-1.

with the local government; during the meeting the experiences of disaster prevention
and relief preparations as well as execution will be used as a basis for revising action
standards, which will further strengthen coordination with local governments and
disaster prevention and relief work.

( Ⅱ ) Personnel and Equipment Deployment According to Disaster
Prevention Requirements

Different theaters of operations (defense command) are combined into joint defense
groups responsible for disaster prevention and relief areas. Overall plans are made
for the utilization of dedicated disaster relief forces based on type of disaster,
regional characteristics and level of threat. During the flood season or when disaster
warnings are issued, the forces deploy troops and equipment in advance so that they
are immediately available for any type of disaster relief mission. To achieve disaster
reduction and rapid recovery, councils at each level, local governments and the
ROC Armed Forces work together to survey important supplies, vehicles and gear
during peace time and establish robust operations mechanisms, so that information
on available resources, requested or rented, can be immediately provided to the local
government when disasters occur. The over 1.7 hundred vehicles and gear of the
ROC Armed Forces immediately available for disaster relief are listed by type and
area in Table 8-1.

( Ⅲ ) Relief Resource System Establishment

Emergency Management Information Systems (EMIS) were established in
emergency operations centers of each theater of operations zone to create a horizontal
link with emergency operations centers of central and county/city governments;
hardware and software for video conferencing, telephone, fax, and information
systems were installed in the emergency operations centers; units are required to
abide by the “ROC Armed Forces Regulations on Internet Access” when using the
hardware and software. This system allows emergency operations centers of the
ROC Armed Forces to simultaneously gain information on the disaster situation with
emergency operations centers of central and county/city governments, enabling them
to implement disaster relief operations and immediately respond to emergencies.
Furthermore, the ROC Armed Forces developed a Disaster Relief Resource
Management System, which allows it to rapidly compile statistics, effectively control
the deployment of its disaster relief resources, simplify command and report operation
procedures, and improve the accuracy of its disaster relief results. The system was
tested by the joint operations command center and strategy implementation units in
April 2011, and will continue to be calibrated based on test results, allowing it to
further entail the successful execution of disaster prevention and relief missions.

( Ⅳ ) War Gaming and Live Exercises for Disaster Prevention and
Relief

The ROC Armed Forces will continue to strengthen the intensity and extensiveness
of disaster relief related war gaming and live exercises, so as to verify the
appropriateness and feasibility of its disaster contingency plans, operation procedures
and action standards. Besides adding disaster relief as a part of the “joint search and
rescue” and “Wan-An” exercises, war gaming of each theater of operations and flow
training of major exercises, disaster relief exercises at the national level are held in
cooperation with the competent authority between March and June each year. Each
theater of operations (defense command) integrates the armed forces in live exercises
for different disasters, including flood, landslide, earthquake, nuclear accidents or
air and maritime disasters, as well as the promotion of “national disaster prevention
education.” These endeavors aim to establish good communication channels between
departments, local governments and the public, and effectively integrate disaster

relief capabilities. Officers of defense forces and mountain area reserve company
take part in local disaster relief drills; in areas where disasters frequently occur, they
jointly conduct site surveys, hold lectures and disaster relief drills, so as to achieve
good cooperation and enhance overall disaster relief capabilities.

( Ⅴ ) Strengthening Professional Competency Training for
Disaster Prevention and Relief

As of 2010, disaster prevention and relief courses have been included in the basic and
advanced education of military academies, so as to strengthen the disaster prevention
and relief training and team spirit of the ROC Armed Forces. Utilizing the current
capacity of the Nantou Chushan Training Center of the National Fire Agency, each
month starting in February 2010 volunteer officers and NCOs are selected to take
the “large scale disaster general training course for seed instructors of the ROC
Armed Forces,” and lieutenant colonels and colonels are selected to attend “disaster
prevention and relief management lectures” and participate in the Atomic Energy
Council’s annual nuclear accident decision-making lecture. In addition, military
personnel are also sent to professional rescue team trainings of the Red Cross Society.
The extensive participation in government and private disaster prevention lectures
and trainings aims to incorporate response measures of different disasters and
nuclear accidents into the education of military academies, as well as the training and
evaluations of armed forces, enhancing the professional knowledge of military cadres
and solidifying the disaster relief competencies of the armed forces.

( Ⅵ ) Nuclear Safety Protection Preparations

In consideration of the complex disaster that occurred in Japan, the ROC Armed
Forces formulated response measures in accordance with the government’s 28
principles to “react while the threat is still overseas,” “manage our borders” and
“respond to disasters within our territory.” Furthermore, in accordance with the
“Nuclear Emergency Response Act,” “Guidelines of the ROC Armed Forces
on Operations of the Nuclear Accident Support Center,” “Standing Operating
Procedures for Disaster Prevention and Relief of the ROC Armed Forces” and
annual disaster relief preparation status, the ROC Armed Forces holds nuclear safety
drills using the scenario of nuclear accidents in Taipower’s nuclear power plant,

which is planned and controlled by the Atomic Energy Council. The third and fourth
theaters of operations are responsible for setting up support centers to assist local
governments and regional radiation monitoring centers with the execution of various
missions, including radiation detection, decontamination operations, communication
performance verification, traffic control, and transportation and medical evacuation of
civilians. The purpose of these drills is to integrate military and civilian disaster relief
capabilities, verify results of preparations by task forces for emergency response to
nuclear accidents, provide suitable support to the government for dealing with nuclear
power plant emergencies, and maintain social stability.

( Ⅶ ) Relocation Programs in Military Facilities

Local governments have all planned emergency sheltering areas in order to
effectively evacuate and accommodate disaster evacuees when disasters first occur.
The Armed Forces has re-planned the sheltering capacity of its 110 military facilities
into two categories, low density (beds provided) and high density (no beds provided),
so as to satisfy the emergency sheltering requirements of local governments. Military
facilities that offer low density (typical disasters) accommodation can shelter over 20
thousand disaster evacuees, and military facilities that offer high density (complex
disasters) accommodation can shelter over 32 thousand disaster evacuees; totaling
more than 53 thousand disaster evacuees. The number and capacity of military
facilities that can be used for sheltering disaster evacuees is shown in Table 8-2.

( Ⅷ ) Medical Aid for Disaster Relief

During peace time, armed forces hospitals and sanitation troops are to complete
the organization of disaster relief medical teams, personnel training and supplies
preparedness. When the nation faces a complex disaster, the medical teams are
to immediately carry out emergency medical missions, providing patient care
and evacuation aid to disaster areas; additional medical teams may be dispatched
depending on developments of the disaster situation. In addition, the Tri-service
General Hospital was designated by the Atomic Energy Council and Department of
Health as a level 3 hospital for nuclear disasters, and has a radiation treatment center
for treating victims of nuclear disasters.

( Ⅸ ) Utilizing Military Reservists to Support Disaster Relief

1. Implementation of the three-meeting joint operation mechanism

During peacetime, the three meetings “mobilization preparation, capability
integration and coordination, and disaster prevention and relief” jointly
operate to effectively control listed vehicles, gear and supplies, completing
basic capabilities surveys, and establishing good communication channels
so as to allocate resources efficiently. This effectively integrates and utilizes
local resources, and strengthens command, control and coordination
functions.

2. Coordination with the mobilization system

In the event of a major disaster or when there is such risk, liaison officers
are dispatched to be stationed in emergency operations centers of all levels
in accordance with the “Regulations on the implementation of disaster
preparations and response measures in coordination with the civil and allout defense mobilization preparation system,” which was amended by
the Ministry of the Interior and Ministry of National Defense, and the
“Implementation guidelines of the ROC Armed Forces for stationing liaison
officers to provide aid to disaster prevention and relief” promulgated by the
Ministry of National Defense. Besides gathering information on the disaster
situation and working with the all-out defense mobilization preparation
system, the liaison officers assist local governments with force support
application and acquiring gear and vehicles, so as to carry out disaster relief
and post-disaster restoration missions. (As shown in Table 8-3)

3. Utilization of military reservists to support disaster relief

In response to the amendment to the “Disaster Prevention and Protection
Act,” which states that “the ROC Armed Forces should actively assist with
disaster relief in the event of a major disaster” and that “military reservists
may be called to support disaster relief,” the Ministry of National Defense
promulgated the “Regulations on Mustering Reserves to Execute Disaster
Prevention and Relief Operations,” stipulating the nature of missions,

The ROC Armed Forces executes international humanitarian aid missions in
coordination with the nation’s overall policy. Upon receiving an aid request from the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, related elements are enabled and personnel are assigned
to complete preparations of troops, aircrafts (vessels) and administrative operations,
so that rescue teams may reach the disaster areas within the shortest amount time and
take part in international relief tasks, fulfilling our duties to international humanitarian
aid.

Section 2 Implementation Status

I. Disaster Relief Operations

( Ⅰ ) Between January 1[st], 2010 and May 31[st], 2011, the ROC Armed Forces
successfully executed all missions assigned by the “central emergency
operations center,” including: 17 major disaster relief missions for the cargo
ship accident of the “Che Tung Chi No.146” from Mainland China, Chiahsien earthquake, National Highway No.3 landslide, typhoon disasters
(Namtheun, Lionrock, Meranti, Fanapi and Megi) and the Alishan train
accident; and 133 emergency rescue missions, including OceanLaLa,
accumulating to a total of over 149 thousand troops, 5.5 thousand vehicle
runs, 650 aircraft sorties and 460 vessel trips. (As shown in Table 8-4)

( Ⅱ ) Over the years, the ROC Armed Forces has implemented “nuclear emergency
exercises” in cooperation with the Atomic Energy Council, and have achieved
good results. The nuclear emergency exercise for Nuclear Power Plant 3 and
its surrounding areas in Hengchun Township, Pingtung County in 2010 was
significantly beneficial to the local government’s disaster relief missions. In
response to the massive earthquake that hit Miyagi, Japan on March 11[th],
2011, which caused a tsunami that resulted in the radiation leak of nuclear
power plants, the ROC Armed Forces has begun to execute expanded nuclear
emergency exercises in the surrounding areas of nuclear power plants in
coordination with local governments since 2011. In addition, starting on
March 17[th] the 5 radiation detection stations were set up in Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport, Taipei SonShan Airport and Kaohsiung International
Airport in cooperation with the Atomic Energy Council to provide aid to
radiation detection and decontamination of travelers entering from Japan.
Based on the decision of the National Disaster Prevention and Protection in
its 9[th ]meeting on May 1[st], the airport radiation detection mission was lifted;
during the execution of the mission over 16 hundred visit of troops were
dispatched, and over 202 thousand entry passengers were scanned, in which
45 passengers were found with values above the scanner’s settings, and 7
passengers received aid with radiation removal.

( Ⅲ ) Disaster relief related counseling is provided during peacetime to military
personnel to help them successfully execute such missions. When on disaster
relief missions, counselors at each level are assigned to the forces to provide
counseling and assistance. After executing disaster relief missions, their
focus turns to “post-disaster physiological rehabilitation” and the screening,
counseling and referral of cases with “post trauma stress disorder.” For
the various disaster relief missions executed since 2010, a total of over 17
hundred visit of counselors were dispatched and provided over 86 thousand
times of individual counseling, group counseling, assessment and screening,
mental health counseling and disaster evacuee services, effectively helping
them return to their normal lives and ensuring the physical and mental health
of military personnel. (As shown in Table 8-5)

( Ⅳ ) The Ministry of National Defense flexibly adopts diverse methods for news
related to disaster relief. Besides actively releasing information on the rescue
strategy of “preparing for disasters in advance, deploying troops with an
eye to disaster preparedness, and ensuring readiness for rescue operations,”
the Ministry assists media with finding transportation tools to disaster areas

types of media in the form of press releases, data, text messages, photos and
video.

II. Disaster prevention

( Ⅰ ) River and Reservoir Dredging

Guided by the Executive Yuan’s policy to “incorporate training as a part of people’s
livelihood constructions,” the Ministry of National Defense carries out river dredging
constructions, which serve the functions of preventing river hydrology from being
damaged, avoiding waste of national resources and preventing illegal mining of
sand and gravel, under the premise of “not affecting the Armed Forces’ readiness,

not causing damage to the Armed Forces’ command system, and not exceeding the
Armed Forces’ support capabilities.” The river course is used as a simulation training
site for troops to practice machinery operations, so that they will become proficient in
a particular line after discharge and have better opportunity for employment, creating
a win-win situation.

In response to requests of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Council of
Agriculture from 2010 to May 31st, 2011, the Armed Forces successfully carried
out water reservoir dredging missions at the cable-stayed bridge of Kaoping River
and Caogong Canal of Kaoping River, Cengwen Reservoir and Nanhua Reservoir,
utilizing a total force of over 37 thousand visit,over 81 hundred visit of construction
machinery, and dredging a total volume of over 3,331 thousand M[3]; in which the
dredge volumes of Caogong Canal and the cable-stayed bridge section of Kaoping
River and Cengwen Reservoir in 2010, which were the highest compared with past
years. In coordination with requirements of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, two
dredging constructions at Caogong Canal of Kaoping River and Nanhua Reservoir
will be implemented with a dredge volume of 108M[3] in 2011, hoping to effectively
reduce river course, reservoir sedimentation and lower the possible of flooding. (As
shown in Table 8-6)

( Ⅱ ) Disaster Prevention and Land Restoration

In response to the government’s “land restoration” work, the Armed Forces drew out
high (low) mountain areas in northern, central and southern Taiwan, and adopted the
method “training, planting trees and restoring the land along the way” to complete
disaster relief preparations before the flood season. Utilizing data provided by the Soil
and Water Conservation Bureau, the Armed Forces carried out land restoration (tree
planting, slope protection, landslide information gathering, and emergency landing
site survey) and surveys along its low altitude marching routes in northern, central
and southern Taiwan, so as to establish a basis for future disaster relief missions.

-----

Surveys of high risk areas in Taiwan conducted by the Armed Forces focused on
149 landslide areas, traffic arteries, rivers, barrier lakes and fault zones, and roughly
333 low-lying areas; aerial and satellite images and numerical data were integrated
and provided to each theater of operations for the establishment of “topographic
databases.” In addition, to give consideration to both disaster prevention and national
land restoration, the special forces plans and implements two batches of “defile route
march” each year; two middle and low altitude routes are selected from northern
and southern Taiwan; landslide potential river surveys, aerial force disaster relief
route surveys, casualty evacuation, and emergency rescue point trial lift off and trial
landing are implemented at the same time.

III. International Humanitarian Assistance

Our ally Haiti was struck by a severe earthquake in January 2010, resulting in
countless casualties and left the country in desperate need for aid. In coordination
with the government and Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ overall plans for providing
humanitarian aid, the Ministry of National Defense prioritized the assembly and
dispatch of personnel, medicine and medical equipment to Haiti for the earthquake
disaster relief mission “Tzuhang 99-1,” which mainly provided medical support for
search and rescue operations and donated supplies. C-130 air carriers were dispatched
to transport 156 types of medical supplies in a total of 266 boxes (over 53 hundred
kg) to aid Haiti. In addition, medical personnel of Tri-Service General Hospital,
SongShan Armed Forces General Hospital, Armed Forces Beitou Hospital, Red Cross
Society, Taiwan Root Medical Peace Corps and Taiwan International Health Action
were organized into medical teams to Haiti, jointly caring for a total of 2,700 patients
during their stay there.

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA)
specially wrote a thank-you letter to the ROC government and private sectors for
providing humanitarian aid and care to Haiti after the earthquake. Taiwan’s relief
efforts in Haiti were praised in the Wall Street Journal Asia and Time Magazine with
articles titled “Taiwan quick to contribute to Haiti relief efforts” and “For Taiwan,
helping Haiti offers rare moment on world stage,” showing that our disaster relief
performance has won international respect.

Section 3 Direction of Efforts

Disaster prevention and relief is an unshirkable responsibility of the ROC Armed
Forces. Substantial effects have been obtained from related preparations as verified
during Typhoon Parma, Typhoon Lupit, Chia-hsien Earthquake, National Highway
No.3 Landslide, Typhoon Fanapi, and Typhoon Megi. In the light of the “complex
disaster” in Japan after the Miyagi earthquake, which resulted in a tsunami and
radiation leaks, the Armed Forces will continue to follow the government policy and
integrated planning. Besides continuing to strengthen operational training, “complex
disaster” response and rescue exercises will be added, and the overall disaster relief
capabilities of the Armed Forces will be enhanced via war gaming, professional
disaster relief training, development of disaster relief doctrines and training orders,
establishment of reserve’s disaster relief capacity and procurement of disaster relief
equipment. These endeavors are carried out to in the light of possible disasters in the
future, so that the Armed Forces will be fully prepared to protect the lives and assets
of ROC citizens.

I. Intensify Disaster Prevention and Relief Training

The ROC Armed Forces will continue to coordinate with government agencies
to acquire training quota for military personnel in domestic and foreign disaster
prevention and relief trainings and lectures, such as advanced detection instrument
operations and professional construction methods and skills, so as to cultivate
seed instructors and strengthen the Armed Forces’ professional competencies in
disaster relief. Military, police, firefighting, private relief institutions and related
dedicated personnel have been included in the training flow of the Nantou Chushan
Training Center and jointly receive training; a certificate of qualification and contact
information is issued upon completion of training; this method hopes for personnel
from different units to become familiar with the capabilities and skills of other units,
establishing a contact network that is beneficial to disaster relief cooperation, and
enhancing the nation’s overall disaster relief capabilities and team spirit.

II. Establish Reserve Disaster Prevention and Relief
Capabilities

( Ⅰ ) Disaster prevention and relief missions carried out in accordance with the
“Contingency Response Regulations for the ROC Armed Forces during
Regular Military Preparation Periods” are mainly based on the active force.
According to the “Disaster Prevention and Protection Act” and “Regulations
on the ROC Armed Forces’ Assistance in Disaster Prevention and Relief,”
muster-calls may be utilized to mobilize reserve forces to provide aid to
disaster prevention and relief missions.

( Ⅱ ) Current reserve forces are categorized as disaster relief support forces of
the ROC Armed Forces, and are called upon in batches under the unified
command of each theater of operations. These reserve forces support the
“organization of disaster relief supplies,” “medical transportation duties,”
“environment cleaning and sterilization,” “setting up centers for sheltering
disaster victims” and “Other (including disaster victim evacuation and waste
disposal).”

( Ⅲ ) In order to expand its disaster relief force, the ROC Armed Forces plans on
strengthening disaster prevention practical training (4 hours) in the muster
training of reserve forces to strengthen their disaster prevention capabilities.
When a large scale disaster occurs or when the Armed Forces is required to
execute long-term disaster prevention and relief missions, reserve forces that
have completed their muster training will be immediately utilized for disaster
prevention and relief. Muster training is more densely scheduled during
the annual flood season between July and October, so as to provide support
forces for disaster prevention and relief.

( Ⅳ ) In response to the sequential total force reduction of the Armed Forces, the
“joint operations” command mechanism is employed to integrate highly
specialized forces, e.g. NBC protection and engineer, of the Army, Navy and
Air Force. These specialized forces are assembled into task forces for the
prevention and relief of specific disasters, and may mobilize reserve forces
when necessary. The purpose of this arrangement is to maintain immediate

disaster response capabilities, continuously carry out disaster relief missions,
and implement post-disaster restoration, protecting the lives and assets of
civilians.

III. Strengthen Complex Disaster Prevention and
Relief Exercises

In consideration of the Miyagi earthquake, “complex disaster” response and relief
exercises have been added, so as to further enhance disaster prevention and relief
mechanisms at each level. Starting in 2011, “disaster relief war gaming” and
“disaster relief live exercises” for complex disaster scenarios, including earthquake,
tsunami and nuclear power plant, will be carried out in northern, central, southern
and eastern Taiwan between March and May. A “disaster relief computer-aided
command post exercise” demonstration was held in May, in which a natural disaster
scenario was created using computer simulation tools; the demonstration established
standard operating procedures for disaster relief exercises, and refined disaster
relief plans, preparedness and execution, effectively enhancing the Armed Forces’
disaster relief capabilities. Under the guidance of the Executive Yuan Office of
Disaster Management, theaters of operations coordinated with local governments
in implementing the “WanAn Exercise” and the Executive Yuan’s annual disaster
prevention and relief live exercise, hoping that by verifying response mechanisms
they will be fully prepared to protect the lives and assets of civilians.

IV. Consolidate Chemical, Biological, Radiation and
Nuclear Disaster Relief Capabilities

In order to consolidate and utilize capabilities of chemical troops to achieve
nuclear, biological and chemical protection and disaster relief, the Ministry of
National Defense has made overall plans for the establishment of prevention and
relief capabilities, and instructed theaters of operations on how to utilize related
mechanisms and how to command chemical troops within their jurisdiction to
execute disaster prevention and relief missions. To enhance the NBC disaster relief
capabilities of the ROC Armed Forces and successfully execute joint relief missions,
a number of measures have been adopted for different stages, including consensus
building, division of rights and responsibilities, short-term training courses,
professional chemical troops education, garrison and base training and assessment,
and participation in NBC disaster relief exercises.

**_Therefore, the Armed Forces immediately engages in disaster relief when disasters first_**
**_occur, so as to protect the lives and assets of the people._**

V. Development of Doctrines for Assistance in
Disaster Relief

Based on the valuable experiences acquired from major disaster relief missions
executed in recent years, and after referring to the U.S. Federal Emergency
Management Agency’s “Urban Search and Rescue Field Operations Guide” and U.S.
Army’s “Military Operations Other Than War (MOOTW),” the ROC Armed Forces
completed the Regulations on Combat Information Center Operations, Combat
Readiness Regulations and “Contingency Response Regulations for the ROC Armed
Forces during Regular Military Preparation Periods.” In addition, 33 doctrines
including the “Regulations of the ROC Armed Forces’ Assistance in Disaster
Prevention and Relief” were developed using the complex disaster relief experience
of the Japan Self-Defense Forces, and are used as a basis for disaster relief, exercises,
education and lectures. The doctrines are verified via joint operations in various
exercises, which also serve as a basis for making additions and revisions, in hopes
of establishing doctrines for the prevention and relief of different types and levels of
disasters, and effectively enhancing joint disaster prevention capabilities.

**_nuclear disaster relief exercises, so as to enhance disaster relief capabilities._**

VI. Acquisition of Disaster Relief Equipment

In order for the Armed Forces to respond to “conventional and unconventional safety
threats” and “natural or man-made complex disasters,” planning of future weaponry
and equipment acquisition will give consideration to both defense readiness and
disaster relief, so as to enhance future defense and disaster relief performance. The
Armed Forces has designated the army’s “multipurpose engineer vehicle”, “forklift”,
“NBC (nuclear, biological, and chemical) protection and response equipment”,
and the navy’s “special operations inflatable boat” as priority acquisitions for the
2010 fiscal year. Furthermore, machinery and equipment related to disaster relief
requirements will be comprehensively reviewed based on past disaster relief
experiences and Japan’s nuclear disaster. Based on the principle of “disaster relief
during peacetime and combat during wartime,” military investment projects in
2011 include rescue helicopter, new utility helicopter, NBC equipment, amphibious
Chengkung boat, health service equipment and multipurpose engineer vehicle, and
have a total budget of NT$11.3 billion. After the equipment is acquired, they will
become a part of the national disaster prevention and relief system, and facilitate
future disaster relief missions.

Armed Forces has provided a total of over 320 ha of land in Hsinchu,
Taichung, Chiayi, Tainan and Kaohsiung. Land use will be adjusted in
coordination with the overall plans of local governments for urban planning
to increase its land-use value, and over 130 ha of land will be allocated
for public facilities. Assistance will be provided to local governments for
acquiring land for public facilities, increasing the economic efficiency of
land-use, and improving the urban landscape.

3.Promote Cultural Preservation Work in Old Villages for Military Dependents

In accordance with the “Regulations on the Selection and Examination
of Old Military Dependents’ Villages for Cultural Preservation,” each
municipal,county and city government designates old military dependents’
villages as cultural preservation sites and formulates cultural preservation
plans for the Ministry of National Defense to select from. Cultural
preservation sites are divided into five areas – northern, central, southern,
eastern and offshore islands, and 1 to 2 sites are selected from each
area, selecting roughly 10 old military dependents’ villages for cultural
preservation. The cultures and relics of these villages are then thoroughly
protected so that they may become sustainable tourism and cultural assets.

II. Medical and Health Care

The ROC Armed Forces will continue to maintain the safety of forces, to help soldiers
settle down, and to let their dependents feel at ease. It will provide servicemen and
their dependents with proper medical services, implement various prevention and
health care affairs, and closely cooperate with the government’s health policy based
on the concept that diseases have no boundaries and don’t care for social status, as
well as the aspiration to protect the people, hoping to safeguard national health.

( Ⅰ ) Prevention and Health Care

To improve the health of servicemen, the Armed Forces irregularly utilizes different
media and various gatherings to propagate epidemic trends announced by the
competent authority of health, and effectively implement prevention and health care
measures. Furthermore, the Armed Forces has established a reporting mechanism
for military hospitals and units as active means to protect servicemen with selfinjury tendency. Additionally, to build a tobacco and betel nut free Armed Forces,
the Ministry of National Defense and Department of Health have joined hands in
promoting the “Smoking and Betel Nut Chewing Prevention Project,” actively
encouraging servicemen to quit smoking and betel nut chewing. Using conscripts
in 2010 as an example, the rate of smoking and betel nut chewing dropped by 4.5%
and 1.3%, respectively (as shown in Table 9-1). Starting in 2010, the Armed Forces
further studied and monitored smoking and betel nut chewing behavior among

servicemen, in hopes of finding a more comprehensive and effective prevention
strategy.

( Ⅱ ) Infectious Disease Prevention

Based on the “ROC Armed Forces Guidelines on Monitoring, Investigating,
Handling and Reporting Outbreak of Infectious Diseases,” the Ministry of National
Defense utilizes a seamless monitoring mechanism and reporting system for early
detection of infectious disease cases. This allows the immediate initiation of epidemic
investigation, medical treatment and proper prevention measures in hopes of being
a step ahead to prevent infectious diseases from spreading. In response to the global
outbreak of H1N1 in 2009, the Executive Yuan established a H1N1 epidemic
prevention command center, and the ROC Armed Forces established “Ministry
of National Defense H1N1 Emergency Response Command Center” to reinforce
vaccination and prevent severe cases and cluster events.

Furthermore, in response to the outbreak of dengue fever in southern Taiwan in 2010
and the Executive Yuan establishing a dengue fever epidemic prevention command
center, the Ministry of National Defense on October 29[th], 2010 announced the “ROC
Armed Forces Dengue Fever Epidemic Prevention Command Center Implementation
Plan” to strengthen breeding source removal and container reduction, so as to prevent
indigenous confirmed cases of dengue fever from occurring. (As shown in Table 9-2).

In addition, regarding chronic infectious diseases, the Ministry of National Defense
implements epidemic prevention tasks in coordination with the competent authority
of health, e.g. control of tuberculosis confirmed cases, thoroughly checking personnel
that came in contact with the cases and giving them chest x-rays. For cases infected
with HIV, a follow-up list is compiled and the cases are guided to receive medical
treatment; after discharge or inactivation the cases are reported to the Centers for
Disease Control, and the health agency at the permanent address of the case will be
responsible for future follow-ups.

( Ⅲ ) Military Medicine

1. Simulated Diving Training

Considering that professional diving personnel of the ROC Armed Forces
are under high pressure environments for long periods of time, and that
improper pressure reduction might cause damage to their skeletal muscles
and nerve endings, the Zuoying Armed Forces General Hospital provides
long-term support to related agencies and organizations, including the
Bureau of Employment and Vocational Training, in terms of simulated
diving training, so as to reduce the occurrence of diving accidents. This
allows diving personnel to experience and become familiar with the
abnormal pressure underwater in a safe and controllable environment.

2. Emergency Care Training

To enhance the self-help and mutual help capabilities of servicemen, the
“ROC Armed Forces CPR Training and Testing Guidance Plan” was
implemented in 2010 to effectively enhance the basic life support capabilities
of general servicemen. In addition, for servicemen on guard duty to be
competent in handling emergencies, the Armed Forces has continued to
hold “Emergency Medical Technician Training Courses”; all qualified
trainees of the course received certificates issued by the Department of
Health, effectively strengthening emergency rescue and casualty evacuation
capabilities during peacetime and wartime.

III. Assitance to Law and Enforcement

The military police assists police agencies with the defense of public security in
accordance with “The Code of Criminal Procedure,” “Regulations on the Dispatch
of Judiciary Police,” “Code of Court Martial Procedure” and “Military Police
Support Protocol,” mainly focusing on military cases, as well as other judicial cases.
Furthermore, the military police cooperates with the police system to establish
“threat warning and intelligence gathering” capabilities during peacetime, so as to
consolidate the foundation for “counter-terrorism and emergency response.” From
January 1[st], 2010 to May 31[st], 2011, the military police contrilruted to over 790
criminal cases and referred over 23 hundred people; captured 95 deserters; tracked
down 2 cases of Mainland stowaways with a total of 5 persons; confiscated 35 pieces
of light weapons, 140 bullets, and various narcotics weighing over 130kg.

IV. Landmine Removal on Offshore Islands

In response to the lifting of battlefield governance on offshore islands in 1993 and in
coordination with the promulgation of “Anti-personnel Landmines Control Act” in
2006, the ROC Armed Forces in October 2006 ordered the Army’s engineer troops
to remove landmines in Kinmen’s “Sishan range” on a trial basis. The engineer
troops successfully accomplished the mission at the end of November the same year,
verifying that self-executed landmine removal was feasible. The Army Headquarters
thus on April 1[st], 2007 assembled a “landmine removal group” dedicated to “selfexecuted landmine removal” and management of “contracted landmine removal,” so
as to cut down on government spending and implement the government’s plan on the
development of offshore islands.

There are currently 308 minefields in Kinmen and Matzu, covering an area of
3,526,thousand m[2]. Landmine removal by the military and contractors in Kinmen
cleared 1,073 thousand m[2] of minefields between 2010 and May, 2011, removing
over 30 thousand landmines; contracted landmine removal in Matzu cleared over 294

thousand m[2] of minefields between 2010 and May 2011, removing over 44 thousand
landmines. Furthermore, Landmine removal by the military and contractors of 84
minefields in Kinmen (Wuchiu) will be carried out in 2011-2012, and is scheduled for
completion in 2012.(As shown in Table 9-3)

V. Counseling and Relief

The Military Personnel Saving Administration began implementing the “Military
Counseling Project for Financing” in August 2005 based on the principle of serving
fellow servicemen, and cooperated with domestic financial institutions in providing
referral services to servicemen for gaining mortgage and credit loans. Up to the end
of 2010, over 15 thousand servicemen received assistance with gaining credit loans,
with the total loan amount reaching NT$7.63 billion; over 29 hundred servicemen
received assistance with gaining mortgage loans, with the total loan amount reaching
NT$9,75 billion. These services allow servicemen to execute their operational duties
with peace of mind using proper financing channels. In the future, the Military
Personnel Saving Administration will continue to counsel servicemen in terms of
finance, and encourage them to save the money they will need to have a family,
switch to another profession and use after discharge, further consolidating morale of
troops and improving welfare for the Armed Forces.

VI. Releasing National Defense Files for Public
Access

( Ⅰ ) Current Status of File Access

To protect the public’s right to know and implement regulations of “The Freedom of
Government Information Law,” “Administrative Procedure Act,” “Classified National
Security Information Protection Act” and “Archives Act” in order to increase file
access, the Ministry of National Defense organized permanent files with historical and
political value or serve as legal evidence, which totaled to over 38 thousand volumes
with roughly 1.21 million files, reclassified the files, created electronic catalogs for
the files, and published catalogs of non-confidential historical and political files on
the Ministry of National Defense’s website (http://www.mnd.gov.tw). People may go
online and apply for access to files on the ROC Armed Forces historical and political
file browsing system.

Part 4 Bringing Peace and Stability to the Country
251

Chapter 9 Service for the People


-----

( Ⅱ ) Online File Access

To fully utilize the value of files and strengthen access application services for
the public, the “Five-Year Plan for Archive Computerization” is actively being
implemented, digitizing current files in stages for rapid query and effective
management; an “online file browsing system” was completed to provide digitized
images, files and data for public access. In addition, citizens may apply for access to
files of government agencies in accordance with the “Archives Act.” To avoid letting
applicants wait too long, the Ministry of National Defense began planning the “ROC
Armed Forces historical and political file browsing system” in December 2008; the
system was formally launched on March 16[th], 2010, and allows the public to go
online to apply for access and browse and copy file images once their application
is approved by the Ministry of Defense; this significantly reduces application and
review time, and helps citizens avoid being fatigued by long journeys.

( Ⅲ ) File Access Services

The ROC Armed Forces has received positive feedback from the public every since it
released its files for public access. Besides applications that involve national security
information, personal criminal data, or information on personnel and salary, for
which disclosure is limited or restricted in accordance with Article 18 of the “Freedom

of Government Information Law” and Article 18 of the “Archives Act,” other
applications for file access have all been approved. Implementation results of 2010 to
May 2011 are shown in Table 9-4.

( Ⅳ ) Future Prospects of File Access

In addition to its own over 38 thousand permanent files, the Ministry of National
Defense plans to collect files that are releasible and value or can serve as legal
evidence from each armed service headquarters. The files will be gathered together to
create a thematic archive, which will serve as a basis for establishing a “Defense File
Access Service Center” in the future. The service center will provide online access
services with full text images, and establish a single window for searching defense
and military files and catalogs, offering convenient services.

VII. Military Reservist Services:

Cadres of the military reservists counseling organization hold the philosophy to “only
give and not take,” and focus on four main areas of work “organization, propaganda,
safety and service.” Besides engaging in tasks associated with the nation’s
political, economic and psychological development, they also serve as “national
defense volunteers” and dedicate themselves to reserve mobilization and services.
Implementation results art summarized below.

( Ⅰ ) Actively Providing Aid for Dealing with Accidents

In order for units to immediately and properly handle major safety incidents or
military civilian disputes and prevent the problem from expanding, cadres of county/
city counseling centers act as bridges for communication between the Ministry of
National Defense, military dependents and the general public, closely following up on
the progress of cases. In 2010, assistance was provided to 1,100 cases with difficulties
and 14 accidents were handled, truly achieving coordination and communication,
and effectively eliminating and providing aid for dealing with security incidents.

( Ⅱ ) Assistance to Disaster Relief

Utilizing the close relationships of counseling cadres with communities and their
extensive distribution throughout 364 townships and neighborhoods, the ROC Armed
Forces regularly conducts surveys on disaster relief capabilities, divides its forces into
disaster relief groups accordingly, and provides necessary training. These endeavors
aim to gain first-hand information on disasters when they first occur, to report the
disaster situation, and to immediately mobilize personnel to engage in disaster relief.
Furthermore, after disasters occur the Armed Forces assists with supply gathering,
disaster evacuee services and community sterilization and recovery, making the
most of its organization to gain public approval. During the major disasters in 2010,
including the “Chia-hsien Earthquake” and “Tyhpoon Megi,” 179 counseling centers
engaged in disaster relief and over 32 hundred counseling cadre members were
mobilized to assist with disaster relief missions of the government and ROC Armed
Forces.

Each county (city) has a “Military Reservists (Children) Scholarship Fund” set
up, and information regarding application acceptance will be released before the
beginning of each academic year (September each year). A suitable time is then
chosen to publicly award scholarships to encourage children of military reservists
to focus on their studies. In 2010, the fund granted scholarships totaling to over
NT$2,54 million to over 16 hundred children of military reservists in junior high or
above with good school grades or from low income households. (As shown in Table

( Ⅴ ) Legal Consultant Recruitment

To help military reservists resolve legal issues and to protect their rights and interests,
during November and December each year units recruit legal consultants based on
actual needs and in accordance with recruitment standards and regulations.

( Ⅵ ) Implementation of Services

Utilizing the consultation organization interface, the Armed Forces will implement
continuous and long-term quality services based on the principle “comprehensive,
available to all, active and effective services”. The Armed Forces aims to protect the
rights and interests of military reservists and unify them via regular services and care.
Furthermore, utilizing the predetermined annual budget in coordination with social

Section 2 Protection of Rights and
Interests

Countries that practice democracy and rule of law emphasize most on the concept
of administration according to law. With regard to national defense related laws,
regulations and orders and in consideration of recent trends and the people’s needs,
the Ministry of National Defense actively reviews related mechanisms while giving
consideration to local development and the rights and interests of the people, so as to
protect the legal rights and interests of both military personnel and civilians. Rights
and interest protection policy are implemented to create an atmosphere in which the
people have faith and support national defense, benefitting the implementation of allout national defense.

I. Complaint System

The Ministry of National Defense established the “1985 Consultation Service
Hotline” and “Duan Mu Cing Mailbox” to establish good communication channels,
protect the lawful rights of servicemen, and set up smooth complaint channels. The
channels hold the attitude that matters must by made as clear as possible, and handle
complaints based on the principle to be “fair and impartial.” Between 2010 and
April 2011, over one thousand complaints were made via the service hotline and
154 complaints via the mailbox; a total of over 38 thousand telephone inquiries were
made, all of which were provided with detailed explanations and properly handled. (As
shown in Table 9-7 and Table 9-8)

II. Protection of Rights and Interests

( Ⅰ ) Policy Planning

In the light of social and environmental changes and recent trends, the Ministry of
National Defense established “Military Personnel Rights Protection Committees”
in the Ministry of National Defense, General Political Warfare Bureau and each
headquarters as a response measure to the society’s emphasis on “rights and interests
of servicemen”; the committees are dedicated to rights protection cases concerning
servicemen. Committee members all have law related professional backgrounds,
and employ a “collegial system” for examining and re-examining applications,
implementing administration according to law, and driving unification and
improvement of forces.

( Ⅱ ) Results

1. Carefully and effectively handling rights protection cases

Military personnel rights protection cases undergo two examination
processes by two committees. Level 1 Committee: established under the
General Political Warfare Bureau and each headquarters, and responsible
for examining rights protection cases concerning military personnel. Level
2 Committee (Ministry of National Defense Military Personnel Rights
Protection Committee): supervised by the deputy minister, responsible
for coordinating and handling rights protection cases concerning military
personnel, and re-examining cases that are unwilling to accept the decision
of the level 1 committee. Statistics of rights protection cases that were
examined and re-examined between 2010 and May 2011 are shown in Table
9-9.

2. Strengthening rights protection and expand propaganda

(1) Single dramas, such as “My Mother’s Sky” and “I Am at Your Side,”
were produced and broadcasted on “Jyu Guang TV Program” to
help servicemen gain a correct understanding of “rights protection.”
Furthermore, the Rights Protection Committee held a Q&A activity on
servicemen’s rights protection based on current regulations, and gained
enthusiastic responses from servicemen and their dependents; a total of
over 103 thousand responses were received.

(2) To build servicemen’s concept about rights protection and encourage
them to use complaint channels within the system, the Rights Protection

Part 4 Bringing Peace and Stability to the Country
259

Chapter 9 Service for the People


-----

Committee printed 450 thousand “rights protection propaganda cards,”
which were handed down by each level 1 committee to all units (especially
recruiting units) and their servicemen, allowing them to fully understand
the Rights Protection Committee’s functions and complaint channels.

3. Periodically holding work meetings to improve the effectiveness of rights
protection:

To implement servicemen rights protection affairs, the Rights Protection
Committee holds a work meeting with supervisors of all level 1 rights
protection committees on a monthly basis. Besides following-up on ongoing
rights protection cases, the meeting conducts opinion exchange and
communication, focusing on overall implementation status, changes in laws
and regulations, and important superior instructions, so as to enhance work
effectiveness.

( Ⅲ ) Promotion Directions

1. Strengthening rights protection system

To implement the military personnel rights protection system, the Ministry
of National Defense protects the rights of its personnel and their dependents
(not including civil officers) based on “profession, rapidness, impartiality,
comprehensiveness,” and publicly, fairly accept servicemen rights protection
cases in accordance with the law. The establishment of this mechanism aims
for the military personnel to have faith in this system within the Ministry of
National Defense, so that they may serve in the military free of worries, thus
strengthening unit trainings and consolidating the capabilities of the R.O.C.
Armed Forces.

2. Administration according to law to protect the lawful rights of servicemen

Rights protection committees at each level are set up to handle issues
related to the personal rights of servicemen, which are brought forth via
the complaint system within agencies and organizations. Decisions from
this mechanism are the manifestation of the Ministry of National Defense’s
public reliance in the implementation and establishment of the military
personnel rights protection system. This mechanism supervises and urges
subordinate agencies (units) of the Ministry of National Defense and each
command and their subordinate (agencies) units (forces) that they must

國防報告書

observe existing regulations when exerting administrative authority over
servicemen rights protection cases. “Administration according to law”
must be obeyed and legal procedures and principles must be respected to
implement military personnel rights protection.

III. Law Relaxation

In terms of policy or enforcement, several restrictions and laws have been relaxed in
response to government policy to drive macro-economic development and protect
public interests. For example, in the amendment to Article 48 of the “Enforcement Act
of Conscription Act” on November 24[th], 2010, men of conscription age not in school
who are sent or recommended to represent the nation to perform or compete overseas,
may now remain abroad 6 months, up from the original 3 months. To encourage men
that have not yet served military service to go abroad, so as to broaden their horizons
and cultivate an international perspective, the maximum term of stay abroad is now
4 months, up from the original maximum of 2 months. Male students of conscription
age studying in high school or college abroad may apply for re-exit before the age
of 24; this will resolve the issue of students being forced to remain overseas, and
allow them to utilize what they learned to contribute to our national development.
Between January 2010 and May 2011, the Ministry of National Defense completed
law relaxation for a total of 19 laws and administrative regulations (see Appendix 9-1),
including the “Act of Military Education,” in hopes of achieving “effective execution
of defense operations, while giving consideration to public interests.”

IV. Legal Services, Litigation Counseling

( Ⅰ ) Legal Services

The Ministry of National Defense enacted the “Military Legal Services Guidelines”
to resolve any questions servicemen, dependents of military personnel (surviving and
deceased) and contracted personnel have regarding the law, protect their legal rights,
and provide legal consultation services to agencies and forces. Service windows are
set up in the Ministry of National Defense, each command headquarters, Military
High Court and its branches, and military district courts to provide legal services,
include law inquiry, contract examination and litigation representation. Between
January 2010 and May 2011, over 10 thousand legal services were provided (including
legal consultation, litigation representation, legal document drafting and draft of
letters to law relating units).

Part 4 Bringing Peace and Stability to the Country
261

Chapter 9 Service for the People


-----

( Ⅱ ) Litigation Counseling

In accordance with the “Military Litigation Counseling Guidelines,” the Ministry
of National Defense recruited a total of 28 lawyers around the nation to provide
servicemen and their dependents with mediation, conciliation, legal document
drafting and court representation services. Between January 2010 and May 2011,
litigation counseling services were provided to 485 cases. In addition, the Ministry
of National Defense established “Regulations Governing Litigation Aid for Military
Personnel for Performing Duties” to subsidize litigation expenses, in which 21
subsidies were provided between January 2010 and May 2011.

V. Appeals and Petitions

( Ⅰ ) Appeals

The purpose for the appeal mechanisms of the Ministry of National Defense and its
subordinate agencies is to provide high quality and convenient services. Under the
Executive Yuan’s guidance and provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, these
services integrate and utilize resources based on principles of being careful and time
efficient. Administrative reformation recommendations, law inquiries, wrongdoing
reports and rights protection are handled with the service attitudes – professional, fast,
accurate and highly efficient, so as to protect the lawful rights of petitioners and to
enhance military-civilian communication. The Ministry of National Defense enacted
its “Directions for the Handling of Public Appeals” in accordance with Article 170 of
the Administrative Procedure Act to handle the following matters. (As shown in Table
9-10)

中華民國壹百年

國防報告書

1. Appeal in Person

A total of 201 appeals were made in persons between 2010 and May
2011, and all cases were handled. When handling appeals in person,
designated personnel along with responsible units followed the procedures
– “understanding the situation on-site,” “meeting with the case to provide
explanation,” “handling the case” and “adding the case to the control list and
reporting results.” The process is controlled for complex cases; personnel
are friendly, attentive, patient and showing empathy when handling such
cases in order to protect the rights of petitioners.

2. Appeal via Letter

In order to listen to public opinions, implement citizen services, strengthen
communication with the public and effectively handle appeal cases, appeal
letters are immediately handled and transferred to the responsible unit
based on its contents, following the standard operating procedures – control,
follow-up and urgent processing; a reply is sent to the petitioner within 30
days after receiving an appeal. Over 15 hundred administrative reformation
recommendations, law inquiries, wrongdoing reports and rights protection
appeals were received between 2010 and May 2010, and all of them were
handled. Furthermore, cases are periodically reviewed and analyzed to
protect the rights of the people.

3. Appeal via E-mail

Appeals via e-mail are carefully handled according to the procedures –
“registration,” “categorization,” “statistics” and “add to control list.” Based
on its content, each appeal is transferred to the responsible unit, which is
required to handle the appeal within a deadline and to keep a record for
future reference. Between 2010 and May 2011,over 23 hundred appeals were
received via e-mail, and all were handled. Each unit empathizes with appeal
and petition cases, shows an active and careful attitude towards handling
such cases, and immediately replies via mail to resolve any questions,
enhancing the efficiency of citizen services.

( Ⅱ ) Petitions

Lodging petitions is a fundamental right protected by the ROC Constitution. The
Petitions and Appeals Committee, Ministry of National Defense, was established
in accordance with the “Administrative Appeal Act,” “Organization Act of the


Part 4 Bringing Peace and Stability to the Country
263

Chapter 9 Service for the People


-----

Ministry of National Defense” and “Organization Regulations of Petitions and
Appeals Committees of the Executive Yuan and its Subordinate Agencies,” and is
responsible for examining petition cases of the Ministry of National Defense and
supervising petition affairs of subordinate agencies. Citizens may send petitions for
any administrative penalties imposed by the Ministry of National Defense and its
subordinate agencies they believe to be illegal or inappropriate and have violated
their rights.

The Petitions and Appeals Committee, Ministry of National Defense, consists of 15
committee members; scholars and experts from the society are chosen as committee
members in accordance with Paragraph 2, Article 52 of the Administrative Appeal
Act; 1/3 of committee members are female, which meets requirements of the Gender
Equality Act. This arrangement aims to make petition consideration more objective
and impartial, and to respect women’s rights. Implementation results are as follows:

1. Of the 284 cases, including 39 petitions of 2009 that were not closed and
245 petitions received between 2010 and May 2011, 257 were closed (92
cases were dismissed, 106 cases were declined, the original judgment was
rescinded for 26 cases, and 33 cases were withdrawn or transferred to the
Executive Yuan or other agencies), as shown in Table 9-11. Among the
cases that were brought to administrative court because the petitioner was
unwilling to accept the Ministry of National Defense’s decision, 61 were
ruled and 60 maintained the original decision, showing that administration
according to law and proper handling of cases have gained substantial
results.

2. To implement “national defense legalization,” the Petitions and Appeals
Committee each year visits and provides petition affairs consultation to
subordinate agencies of the Ministry of National Defense, aiming to propagate
laws, communicate concepts and correct mistakes. The Committee held
the special topic lecture “Streamlining Administration of the Ministry of
National Defense – Practices of Administrative Penalties” and the “Ministry
of National Defense Lecture on Best Practices of Administration” in 2010 to
enhance the professional competencies of staffs and improve the quality of
cases handlings, hoping to increase administrative efficiency and follow out
administration according to law.

( Ⅳ ) Work Report

The Ministry of National Defense and Commands of the ROC Armed Forces handled
a total of 93 state compensation claims in 2010, in which 15 cases were valid with
compensation amount of over NT$ 14,676 thousand; no compensation was offered
for 51 cases after deliberation or litigation, and the remaining 27 cases are still being
examined or in the litigation process.

VII. Compensation for Damages to the Public from
Military Activities

( Ⅰ ) Policy Planning

The “Regulations of Compensation for Damages to the Public from Military
Activities” was established by the ROC Armed Forces to show the government’s


266


-----

中華民國壹百年

國防報告書

sincerity to the public in terms of compensating damages caused by military activities,
and to comfort people and family members who suffered from casualties and asset
losses. These regulations create a legal basis for compensating damages to the public
from military activities between after the Nationalist Government moved to Taiwan
in 1949 and before the “State Compensation Act” was enacted on July 1st, 1981 (this
date may be extended to the termination of battlefield governance on November 7[th],
1992 for residents of Kinmen and Matzu). The regulations were promulgated and
took effect on December 1[st], 1999 and began accepting state compensation claims
for a period of 2 years. To protect the rights and interests of citizens that did not make
state compensation claims in time, the amendment to the regulations on January 7[th],
2004 extended the deadline to November 30[th], 2007.

( Ⅱ ) Results

Although compensation regulations are retroactive, it has been difficult for applicants
to provide evidence because incidents that occurred are at least 30 years in the past.
This has affected the progress of investigations, especially in Kinmen and Matsu,
where the applicants were not able to provide ownership certificates in most cases of
asset loss, and thus the cases could not be deliberated on. To protect the rights and
interests of the people, while giving consideration to the principle of “administration
according to law,” the Ministry of National Defense decided in the 33[rd] compensation
committee meeting on May 18[th], 2010 to ask local governments to assist with reinvestigations and appraisals of cases in which ownership certificates could not
provided, helping resolve applicant’s difficulty with providing evidence of damages
sustained and ownership. Over 25 hundred applications were received as of December
31[st], 2010, over 16 hundred cases have been considered, and compensations totaled
to NT$1.41 billion. (As shown in Table 9-12)

VIII. Military Control and Construction Restriction

In coordination with the comprehensive development of national land, the Vital Area
Regulations and construction restrictions are being actively reviewed and amended,
including vital areas as a part of the National Comprehensive Development Plan,
regional planning and urban planning, and drawing out designated areas for military
purposes.

( Ⅰ ) Reviewing Vital Areas

In response to organization restructuring and armaments replacement, over 780 ha
of controlled area has been removed as of 2010 by actively removing, reducing vital
areas or resetting them as control areas for military facilities.

( Ⅱ ) Adjusting Control Areas for Military Facilities

The range of control areas has been reevaluated to coordinate with local economic
development. As of May 2011, 14 control areas for military facilities were removed
and 30 control areas were reduced; control areas for military facilities were reduced
by over 4 thousand ha.

IX. Gender Equality

The Ministry of National Defense is actively promoting gender equality, and
assembled a “gender equality task force,” consisting of 9 work groups, including
female military personnel, work environment and facilities, gender equality education,

中華民國壹百年

國防報告書

propaganda, military camp rules management, personal safety of women, budget
auditing, legal affairs, and general affairs. Representatives of women’s organizations,
supervisors of each work group, representatives of female military and civil officers
are invited to become members of a number of committees (currently both genders
represent at least 1/3 of all members of any given committee). A meeting is held once
every 4 months to supervise and coordinate operations of each work group, current
results of efforts in gender equality that have followed the recommendations of
committee members are as follows:

( Ⅰ ) Increasing the Ratio of Female Personnel

The recruitments of female personnel have expanded since volunteer officer and
NCO recruitment in 1991. Furthermore, in response to the change of military service
system, recruitment of female volunteer soldiers began in 2007. At present, there
are some 15 thousand female officers, NCOs and soldiers in the Armed Forces,
representing 6.4% of all servicemen, or 11% of the volunteer force, which is a
significant number-increase in female military servicemen. In the future, software and
hardware facilities will be continuously improved and the scope of positions in battle
forces that can be held by female military service will continue to be expanded, so
that more female officers and solders will enter the service and utilize their expertise
to serve the country.

( Ⅱ ) Implementing Related Budgeting

The Ministry of National Defense’s budget for “gender mainstreaming” and “gender
quality” affairs has sequentially grown from NT$14.7 million in 2007 to NT$171.2
million in 2011, taking great strides in terms of budget growth rate.

( Ⅲ ) Promoting the Concept of Gender Equality

Besides inviting experts to give speeches at regular gatherings to promote the concept
of gender quality, articles have been published in a number of newspapers and
magazines, including Youth Daily News, Victorious, Strufight, Love Thy Home and
Jyu Guang TV Program, to strengthen the concept of gender quality. In addition, in
depth counseling and visits are periodically made to forces to discover issues and
further help resolve them. In the future, leaflets will be designed for propaganda in
primary units, and by holding domestic (international) gender equality seminars and

applying perspectives of gender quality in work and life, the Ministry of National
Defense hopes to adopt gender mainstreaming as a part of policy formulation, project
planning, scheme design, talent cultivation and law formulation and amendment,
creating a friendly work environment in which both genders are equals.

( Ⅳ ) Providing Services for Help-Seeking Servicemen

In addition to the “1985 Complaint Hotline” and complaint hotlines of each
Command, which are there to handle sexual harassment and violation of gender
equality cases, the Armed Forces Mental Health Center on March 19[th], 2010
established a “’Sexual Violence’ (includes sexual harassment and sexual assault)
Prevention Hotline” at 0800-885-113; dedicated personnel are providing services 24
hours a day, effectively providing servicemen with an immediate counseling channel
to help stabilize their emotions, while protecting the privacy and rights of the persons
involved.

( Ⅴ ) Establishing Gender Equality Work Group in Services

The Ministry of National Defense in December 2010 promulgated the “Operating
Principles of Gender Equality Work Groups in Commands Headquarters.” Under
the supervision of the MND, all Commands of the Armed Forces have at present
completed the organization of “Gender Equality Work Groups.” This mechanism
will implement gender equality affairs to create an environment without sexual
discrimination.

I. Laws (5 Cases)

Abolished)


To streamline the military education system,
qualifications for division chief, director and section
chief positions have been relaxed, suitably expanding
the flexibility of personnel recruitment to benefit the
inheritance of administrative experiences.

1.In response to the government´s policy to promote
gender equality, after childbearing leave without
pay is approved, military personnel may apply for
allowance during the period of leave; this measure
aims to expand care for military personnel and
ensure the stability of their livelihood during their
childbearing period.

2.To consolidate the financial structure of insurance
for military personnel so as to achieve balance of
payments, after the amendment to this act takes effect,
new members of the military personnel insurance
will still be required to pay premiums after joining
the insurance for 30 years; this is the same as the
insurance system for government employees and
school staff. For military personnel who joined
the insurance before this amendment took effect,
the treasury will pay their premiums after joining
the insurance for 30 years; this is to meet their
expectations and let them enjoy the benefits they are
entitled to.

1.According to Item 4, Paragraph 1, Article 48 of
the amended Enforcement Act of Conscription Act,
men of conscription age not in school who are sent or
recommended to represent the nation to perform or
compete overseas, may now remain abroad 6 months,
up from the original 3 months.

2.Going abroad for tourism or study during summer
vacation is common among male students of
conscription age. To encourage men that have not yet
served military service to go abroad to broaden their
horizons and cultivate an international perspective,
the maximum term of stay abroad is now 4 months
according to Item 5, Paragraph 1, Article 48 of the
amended Enforcement Act of Conscription Act, up
from the original maximum of 2 months.

3.Considering that schools abroad have different
systems and that many students need to study the
foreign language first, if they are restricted from
exiting the country, they will be forced to reside
abroad and not be able to return to Taiwan, thus, male
students of conscription age studying in high school
or college may apply for re-exit before the age of 24
according to Item 1, Paragraph 2, Article 48 of the
amended Enforcement Act of Conscription Act; this
was relaxed from only allowing students in college
to apply for re-exit. In coordination with the revision
to item 2, this will resolve the issue of students
being forced to remain overseas, and allow them to
utilize what they learned to contribute to our national
development.

To expand the source of enlistment, the application age
of volunteer soldiers was relaxed to 26 years old in
the amendment to paragraph 1; this is because when
recruiting in-active-service soldiers who are over 25
years old but younger than 26 years old, they must
first apply for discharge before they meet the age
qualifications for applying to become volunteer enlisted
soldiers.

Self-financed undergraduate students may apply to
become military financed students after completing a
full year of study; the student´s application and date it
takes effect will be reported to the Ministry of National
Defense for approval. The amendment authorizes
each military institution to establish conditions and
procedures for selecting military financed students; the
students are then reported to the Ministry of National
Defense or a designated command headquarters or
agency; this amendment aims to simplify administrative
procedures and achieve hierarchical responsibility.

In response to the government´s energy conservation
and carbon reduction policy, and to promote energy
conservation into in-active-service military personnel
and their dependents, while taking reasonable care of
their livelihood, Article 4 of these Regulations was
amended so that 50% of fees will be discounted for the
first 340KWH, and any electricity usage afterwards
will be calculated at the normal rate; originally, the first
300KWH was calculated at 50% the normal rate,
301~500KWH was calculated at 70%, and any
electricity usage afterwards was calculated at the normal
rate.

“Consultants” referred to in these guidelines are hired

in accordance with the “Ministry of National Defense
Guidelines on Consultant Selection and Recruitment”;
a consultant is a position without remuneration and
will only receive compensation for attending meetings.
According to the interpretation of “legal consultant”
by the Central Personnel Administration on June 16[th],
2004, legal consultants hired in accordance with
the Government Procurement Act are applicable to
consultant related regulations; law specialists hired
based on labor contracts signed with firms that do not
use the title legal consultant are not within this scope.
Legal consultants hired by units and subordinate
agencies in accordance with these guidelines still
provide legal services that belong within the scope of
labor contracts, as provided by the interpretation of the
Central Personnel Administration. Therefore, the term
legal consultant was amended to meet requirements of
practical operations.

Regarding donating the bodies of deceased officers and
soldiers for medical research, the application deadline
`“within` 60 days after death” was canceled in
this amendment to commend them for their donation
and contribution to medical research; in addition, the
restriction that “burial should be completed within 30
days after application is approved” was also canceled.

This amendment clearly specifies prevention measures
and principles and procedures for handling military
personnel sexual harassment cases, so as to refine the
Ministry of National Defense´s ability to handle such
cases. Key points of this amendment are as follows:

1. Added a dedicated complaint channel for sexual
harassment cases.

2. Added emergency handling procedures to prevent
victims from being further hurt.

3. For sexual harassment cases investigations may
now be concurrent with punishments, and the
administrative penalty imposed on victims for not
taking the provided channels was removed.

The overpayment of living allowances by the Ministry
of the Interior to welfare agencies, which was caused by
the difference in reported time of death, was improved
by changing from written form into online transfer of
information on time of death. In the draft amendment to
Article 40 of these principles, “a certificate of proof
should be submitted to the household registration office
of the deceased person´s permanent address” was
amended into `“the case should be registered on the`
Ministry of National Defense´s automated system, and
the Ministry of National Defense will periodically (7
days) transfer the data to the Ministry of the Interior.”

To ensure that defendants depend on the defense rights
of the defense attorney, to protect the procedural justice
of the trial, and to protect the defendant´s right to
choose any attorney, key points of this amendment are as
follows:

1. Paragraph 2 of Article 0203 was added to ensure
that defendants depend on the defense rights of
the defense attorney, and to protect the procedural
justice of the trial.

2. Paragraphs 2 and 4 of Article 0303 were added
to hat defendants depend on the defense rights of
the defense attorney, and to protect the procedural
justice of the trial, so as to eradicate any dispute.

These guidelines were established for the R.O.C. Armed
Forces to rapidly control (and gain information on the
number of ) civilian operators, vehicles and machinery
required for disaster relief. This information is gathered
from the joint operation and response mechanism of
county/city mobilization preparation meeting, capability
integration and coordination meeting, and disaster
prevention and rescue meeting in accordance with Item
4, Paragraph 4, Article 9 and Item 1, Subparagraph
3, Paragraph 3, Article 12 of the Regulations on
Operations of the Central Emergency Operations

Afterword


he Ministry of National Defense (MND)
has periodically published the “National
###### T
Defense Report” since 1992. This Report
explains to the people focuses of current defense
policy and administration, as aiming to make
our national defense transparent and draw the
military and civilians closer together. In this
report the MND not only shows a responsible
attitude towards the society, but also strengthens
people’s confidence in national defense, so that
they support and further participate in defense
infrastructure, achieving the objectives to build
consensus on “all-out defense” and establish
modernized national defense.

he 2011 National Defense Report is the 11[th] national defense report. Besides
continuing the spirit used to compile past reports, it is even more important
### T
to express the ROC Armed Forces’ fearlessness in dangerous environments and
situations, as well as its pragmatic approach towards various initiatives of “defense
transformation.” The MND hopes that by describing and conveying national defense
concepts, and helping the public understand the international situation and difficult
environment as a result of military strength imbalance across the Taiwan Strait, all
citizens will unified as one, clearly understand the enemy threat, and show resolute
patriotic belief. The report insists on the peace concept of “preventing war” and
“preparing for war but not provoking war,” which will help the international society
better understand our efforts to maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait, and thus win
support from our allies and friendly countries, increasing Taiwan’s visibility in the
international society, as well as gaining opportunities to exert our influence.

As we celebrate the 100[th ]anniversary of the R.O.C., the National Defense Report this
year was compiled based on the core axis “A New Epoch of National Defense,” using
the framework of “Strategic Environment,” “National Defense Transformation,”
“National Defense Capabilities” and “Bringing Peace and Stability to the Country”
to objectively discuss severe challenges currently faced by the Armed Forces, clearly
describe results of force build-up and defense preparedness, and reveal directions and
visions of future force development. Furthermore, this report explains the importance
and specific measures of all-out defense, hoping to encourage outstanding youth
to join the military, as well as obtain and maintain reasonable budgets, which will
enable the acquisition of weapons required for combat readiness, and thus protect
national interests and security.

This year’s national defense report was compiled in the form of task forces, members
of which were experts from internal staff units, agencies and the National Defense
University, so that its discussions would be objective and professional and its
contents would be exact and thorough, while being easy-to-understand, readable and
possessing academic research value. The task forces were guided by an advisory
committee (consists of 30 scholars and experts recruited from the private sector) and
supervisors at each level, and were responsible for designing, writing, coordinating
and unifying the structure and data of each part and chapter. In order for the contents
and discussions of this report to be laid out in an orderly manner, besides conducting

a joint review during the compilation of this report, the Ministry of National Defense
has, on numerous occasions, invited scholars, experts and national defense committee
members of the Legislative Yuan to provide their precious recommendations, hoping
to make the overall contents of this report more thorough and complete.

Furthermore, this report especially focuses on the visual effects of its contents, so
to attract more citizens to learn about national defense. Besides providing numerous
photos of the Armed Forces’ exercises and training along with descriptions, personnel
with expertise in art design were selected to use their creativity to make the pictures
and literary compositions of this report excellent, vivid and lively, hoping to arouse
the interest of a larger group of readers, and cause more citizens to be concerned with
defense affairs, thus planting concepts of national defense deep into the hearts of the
people.

The report could not be successfully published with the combined efforts and
dedication of members of the Ministry of National Defense and scholars and
experts from the private sector. Comments and opinions from all sectors are much
appreciated, based on which we hope the Armed Forces to keep improving and carry
out its operational duties at a higher level. The Ministry of National Defense also
hopes that this report will allow citizens to understand, support and further take part
in national defense, thereby ensuring national security, allowing people to live in
peace and enjoy their work, and maintaining regional stability.
