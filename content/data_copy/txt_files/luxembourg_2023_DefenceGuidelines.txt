Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

### Ministerial Foreword


Today, after the conclusion of the Alliance's
military engagement in Afghanistan, the conduct
of a full-scale war of aggression by Russia against
Ukraine, the rise of China, the devastating
effects of several natural disasters on national
territory, the COVID-19 pandemic, the adoption
of the new North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
(NATO) Strategic Concept and the Strategic
Compass of the European Union (EU), as well as
the adoption of new and particularly structuring
capability objectives, a revision of the 2017
edition of the Guidelines is necessary.

More vigilance will be required as a profound
change in global political and security stability
manifests itself. Diplomatic and economic
relations will have to be analysed and
reconsidered through the inclusion of the
security and defence dimensions. A redefinition
of the common security and defence policy has
become inevitable. A general strengthening of
the operational posture, including NATO's
deterrence posture, has to be a key priority of
defence policy.


document in defence matters therefore aims to
underline the continuity of the Luxembourg
Armed Forces’ missions, their orientation in
terms of transformation and is firmly based on
the EU’s and NATO ambitions and capability
priorities.

In this profoundly changed geopolitical
context, marked in particular by the war in
Ukraine, the Luxembourg Defence must be able
to act and contribute to the common effort in
terms of deterrence and collective defence, as
well as crisis prevention and management. It is
therefore more important than ever to develop
capabilities in line with a level of ambition that
meets the expectations of the EU and NATO,
without neglecting national requirements.


In line with the previous publication, this
document emphasizes the continuity of the
national defence policy in securing the legitimate
confidence that Luxembourg must inspire in its
citizens, the Member States of the EU, Allies and
European partners. This new reference


The Luxembourg Defence will seek to develop
capabilities, first and foremost force elements,
in the categories of readiness required to
operate in different security contexts. In addition
to the "traditional mission" of the Luxembourg
Defence, land-based reconnaissance, which will
remain at the centre of the Armed Forces’
activities, new specialisations have been
introduced and will be developed, in particular
in the fields of air, cyber and space, while taking
into account the risks associated with
environmental changes.


-----

Fulfilling all current and future tasks will
require unprecedented efforts in terms of
recruitment and budget, enhanced cooperation
with our partners and reference institutions –
NATO, the EU and the United Nations (UN) – and
an improved balance between staff, equipment,
infrastructure and operational commitments.

The implementation of the Guidelines will
require, among other things, the creation of
new careers within Defence that are essential
for the development and deployment of various
capabilities, whether on land, in the air, in space,
in cyberspace or at sea. This ambition also
implies further promoting the attractiveness of
military careers for the whole population
through the introduction of new careers and
improved training.

New threats or risks to the security of the
Grand Duchy will be taken into account by
Defence in terms of redefining the security
posture and reassessing the capability-building
priorities in close coordination with NATO, the
EU, the Benelux and other reference partners.

With regard to cooperation with the private
sector, the above-mentioned institutions offer a
wide range of cooperation and funding
instruments that can create opportunities for
industry, including small and medium-sized


Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

enterprises (SMEs), as well as for the various
research and innovation actors at national and
European level. For Luxembourg Defence in
general, and the Armed Forces in particular, a
major challenge will be to put in place the
human resource structure, especially the
necessary experts, to ensure an effective
follow-up of these opportunities. These efforts
will form the foundation for an unprecedented
defence effort.

In implementing the Guidelines, the more
complex activities to be undertaken, requiring
long-term efforts, will create opportunities to
make Defence more eco-friendly, more
sustainable and more inclusive, in line with the
3[rd] National Plan for Sustainable Development
(NPSD).

I would like to dedicate the new Guidelines to
Colonel Paul Nilles, who unfortunately left us
too soon in December 2021. As head of strategic
planning, Colonel Nilles drafted the first version
of this text.

Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035


### Executive summary


The new Guidelines of the Luxembourg
Defence, which define the general framework of
its development until 2035, describe the political
orientations approved by the government, in full
compliance with the commitments made at
international level.

Luxembourg, a modern, dynamic and open
country standing in solidarity, has, like any other
nation, an active responsibility in formulating
responses to the present challenges. Our
country, which has enjoyed exceptional
economic growth for decades, has been able to
develop its economy thanks to the security of
the Euro-Atlantic area which is provided through
defensive alliance that is NATO, the EU and
other relevant international bodies such as the
UN and the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). It is important for
the Grand Duchy to remain a committed and
supportive actor in favour of multilateralism
based on the rules, principles and values
established and defended by these international
reference organisations.


The usefulness and credibility of Luxembourg's
defence efforts are essential aspects of how
Luxembourg perceives its role both within NATO
and the EU. Similarly, the Grand Duchy intends
to maintain its position at the forefront of
European integration.

Faced with a severely deteriorated,
increasingly unpredictable and unstable
international security environment, security and
defence policies must be reoriented in favour of


credible deterrence and collective defence. Like
its regional partners and Allies, the Grand Duchy
has to readjust its defence policy. These
Guidelines aim at translating this new policy into
a continuous and profound transformation of
the Luxembourg Directorate of Defence and the
Luxembourg Armed Forces, the key actors to
face current and future security challenges.

The “traditional mission” of the Luxembourg
Defence, the intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance (ISR) activities, will be further
developed. The creation and joint operation of
a bi-national medium combat reconnaissance
battalion with Belgium by 2030 will be at the
nucleus of these efforts. In recent years, the
Luxembourg Defence has also specialised in new
areas such as strategic air transport, space and
cyber. Contributing to the defence against new
threats, special attention is dedicated to cyber
threats. The same applies to security risks
related to the effects and implications of global
environmental changes, especially climate
change. These specialisations will therefore be
strengthened and further developed in the
coming years.


As increased competition for natural resources
is a growing source of conflict, Luxembourg
Defence also has a role to play in preventing
such conflicts and in the ecological transition in
line with the 3[rd] NPSD of 2021 as well as the
European 'Green Deal', which aims to achieve
carbon neutrality by mid-century.


-----

Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

Human resources at the service of the
Luxembourg Defence remain at the heart of this
ambitious transformation. The substantial
increase of the defence effort decided by the
government will go hand in hand with a
reasonable diversification of the fields of activity
of Defence, thus creating more career
opportunities for the personnel, which also
paves the way for an increase of the feminisation
rate in the Luxembourg Armed Forces.

##### Introduction: why an update

Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

#### Introduction: why an update


The present update of the Luxembourg
Defence Guidelines has been drawn up against
the background of a security context profoundly
shattered by the Russian Federation's war of
aggression against Ukraine. The breakdown of
the European security order, but also beyond
European borders, and its consequences require
a thoughtful re-evaluation of Luxembourg's
defence policy. Added to this is the persistent
asymmetric threat of terrorism and growing
competition between great powers. Finally, the
impact of emerging and disruptive technologies
(EDT), which bring opportunities but also risks
and which are becoming one of the main fields
of international competition, technological
superiority being one of the factors of military
victory. This document aims to describe the
context, the framework and the orientations of
Luxembourg’s defence policy.

While the security environment has
deteriorated significantly since the first
Guidelines were issued in 2017, the underlying
motivation for this publication remains
unchanged – to communicate transparently on
the interests, objectives and means of the
Luxembourg Defence.


documents in the field of defence: the Strategic
_Compass for Security and Defence on the EU_
side and the Strategic Concept 2022 on the
NATO side.

An important consequence of this orientation
is a significant increase in our defence effort to
1% of GDP by 2028. This substantial increase
goes hand in hand with continued responsible
management of the budgets in question, while
ensuring a focus on defence requirements
expressed in the NATO, EU and national
frameworks.


A defence effort implies strategic foresight.

This process does not take place in a
conceptual vacuum. Beyond national
requirements, the structuring frameworks for
Luxembourg's planning remain NATO and the
EU. In 2022, these two multilateral institutions
have published their own strategic orientation


At the national level, a major overhaul of the
legislative framework for Defence should also be
mentioned with the “draft law on the organisation
of the Luxembourg Armed Forces”, which was
introduced in the legislative procedure in 2021
and which aims, among other things, to
modernise the legislative provisions regarding
the Luxembourg Armed Forces and to create
new career opportunities. This new legislative
framework will thus be a key instrument in
facilitating the recruitment of a sufficient
number of qualified and committed personnel
thus ensuring the achievement of the ambitious
objectives defined in these Guidelines.

The implementation of these Guidelines will
be further described in internal planning
documents which will be regularly updated by
both the Directorate of Defence and the Armed
Forces Staff, in close coordination with other
relevant national actors.

#### International developments and the implications for transatlantic security


###### 3.1 Underlying trends affecting defence policy

**3.1.1 Challenges to the rules-based**
**international order**
**and the erosion of norms**


Together with its Allies and partners,
Luxembourg is facing the disruption of the
security order established at the end of the Cold
War. The main reference frameworks of
Luxembourg's defence policy share this
perspective. For example, NATO's new Strategic
Concept 2022 notes that: “The Russian
_Federation has violated the norms and principles_
_that contributed to a stable and predictable_
_European security order. We cannot discount the_
_possibility of an attack against Allies’ sovereignty_
_and territorial integrity. Strategic competition,_
_pervasive instability and recurrent shocks define_
_our broader security environment. The threats_
_we face are global and interconnected.” For the_
EU, in the 2022 Strategic Compass on Security
and Defence, the analysis is similar: “Russia’s
_unprovoked and unjustified military aggression_
_against Ukraine […] grossly violates international_
_law and the principles of the UN Charter and_
_undermines European and global security and_
_stability.”_

The impact of this evolution on defence
policies of the Allies and EU Member States
cannot be overestimated. Luxembourg is no
exception in this regard. The fact that Russia is
openly challenging the borders of Europe by use
of military force has led to a fundamental


adaptation of NATO's posture. Western defence
capabilities are being reorganised. This
adaptation will largely determine the direction
of defence in the years to come.

On a regional level, the changing security
environment has led to a fundamental shift in
Finland and Sweden’s political stance towards
NATO. These two countries are net contributors
to security and also play an important role for
security in the Euro-Atlantic area due to their
key geographical position. Luxembourg supports
the will of these countries to strengthen their
security and reaffirms its solidarity with them.
The Grand Duchy has been working together
with both nations for decades, both in the UN
and the EU as well as in the framework of their
close partnership with NATO. Finland and
Sweden share our values and our ambition in
maintaining the rules-based international order.
Luxembourg welcomes the accession of Finland
to the Alliance and hopes that Sweden will also
join NATO in the near future to jointly defend
our values, our freedom and the security of the
Euro-Atlantic area.


The European project continues to witness
internal dissension. The departure of the United
Kingdom has raised the risk of the reversibility
of the European project, while certain national
measures in the context of the management of
the COVID crisis have given a glimpse of what it
would look like if the Schengen agreements
were to be questioned (closure of borders, etc.).
While the economic and societal consequences
of such developments for Luxembourg are


-----

Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

obvious, they also have an impact on the
Luxembourg Defence, which is largely dependent
on multinational and cross-border cooperation,
even for the day-to-day management of activities
(capabilities based outside the national territory,
access to cross-border ammunition depots,
refueling, etc.).


Beyond the European continent, we are
witnessing a hardening of the competition
between the great powers – a competition that
can be read as an expression of rivalry between
opposing political systems (autocracies vs.
democracies). In this context, both the EU and
NATO have sought to redefine the nature of
their relations with great powers that do not
adhere to democratic principles. Thus, the EU's
2022 Strategic Compass notes that: “China is a
_partner for cooperation, an economic competitor_
_and a systemic rival”._

The NATO Strategic Concept 2022, for its part,
elaborates on the subject as follows: “The
_People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) stated_
_ambitions and coercive policies challenge our_
_interests, security and values. The PRC employs_
_a broad range of political, economic and military_
_tools to increase its global footprint and project_
_power, while remaining opaque about its_
_strategy, intentions and military build-up. The_
_PRC’s malicious hybrid and cyber operations […]_
_It strives to subvert the rules-based international_
_order, including in the space, cyber and maritime_
_domains. The deepening strategic partnership_
_between the People’s Republic of China and the_
_Russian Federation and their mutually reinforcing_
_attempts to undercut the rules-based inter­_


_national order run counter to our values and_
_interests.”_

Through its multilateral affiliations, the
enhanced strategic competition with the
People's Republic of China also concerns
Luxembourg, and this goes beyond economic
relations, particularly with regard to resilience
aspects. The outbreak of an armed conflict
between the island of Taiwan and the People's
Republic of China would risk causing catastrophic
disruption of global political stability as well as
the disruption of international trade and supply,
production and value chains with significant
consequences for Luxembourg.


It is certainly not a question of seeking
confrontation with Beijing. However, remaining
indifferent to the security risks emanating from
this actor – for example its military-civilian fusion
strategy, its industrial policy, the deepening of
its partnership with Russia, its espionage
activities, its use of EDTs, the development of its
nuclear arsenal, activities in the fields of space,
cyber or maritime, etc. – is not a viable option
either.

Luxembourg has a strong interest in the EU
continuing to act in a united manner in the
context of defining a strategy towards the
People's Republic of China.


**3.1.2 Impact of technology**

Maintaining a technological edge is critical in
ensuring the ability to dominate strategic
competitors and thus, in fine, to guarantee a


-----

credible Euro-Atlantic deterrence and defence
posture in the face of potential threats. In this
respect, the EDTs constitute a major challenge
– for the Alliance, for the EU and therefore
necessarily for Luxembourg – but also, if properly
exploited, a real opportunity. Without a strategic
build-up in this area, Western countries risk
letting adversaries and competitors gain a
competitive advantage. The loss of this
advantage would translate into an increased
vulnerability, potentially challenging the strategic
stability and the fundamental pillars of
deterrence. Any state or non-state actor
dominating this technological race would be
able to threaten the very foundations of our
societies and thus undermine political cohesion
at national but also NATO and EU level.

Both NATO and the EU have recently launched
major initiatives in this area. In this way, a wide
range of EDTs of particular relevance to defence
and security have been identified. These include
artificial intelligence (AI), big data capabilities,
robotics and autonomous systems, quantum
technologies, biotechnologies, hypersonic
technologies, space related technologies, new
materials, renewable energies, innovative and
carbon neutral fuels and propulsion systems.
For Luxembourg, it is essential to consider green
technologies in this context, as they have the
potential to improve both the operational
efficiency and effectiveness, as well as the
resilience of defence capabilities. Indeed, these
technologies can have a positive impact on
operational autonomy, the supply chain, the
security of supply, as well as the carbon footprint
of capabilities. Ideally, future military capabilities
will be designed by integrating green technologies


Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

from the outset in line with the principles of the
circular economy.


Beyond the purely technical and
implementation related issues, some of the
EDTs also raise fundamental ethical questions.
With regard to lethal autonomous weapon
systems (LAWS), Luxembourg will develop
national standards within the framework of an
interministerial working group created for this
very purpose by the Minister of Defence. At the
international level, Luxembourg will actively
participate in the drafting and implementation
of norms and standards in this area.

**3.1.3 Security risks related to environmental**
**change**


Among the “non-traditional” risks that can
significantly jeopardise our common security
are the impacts and implications of global
environmental change, including climate change,
loss of biodiversity and loss of fertile land or
desertification.

These have an increasing impact on security,
especially in Europe's neighbourhood: whether
through conflicts over access to natural resources
such as agricultural land or water, for example
in the Middle East and the Sahel, tensions over
access to fishing grounds, or through the growing
interest in access to and control of the Arctic
region, which is now navigable and rich in raw
materials.


Increasingly sophisticated studies are
establishing a causal link between the
degradation of natural resources, accelerated in


-----

Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035


-----

particular by climate change, and the beginning
of tensions and conflicts in several regions of the
world. While climate change is not the only
cause of these conflicts, it does contribute to
their aggravation and is seen as a multiplier of
security risks and threats.

For example, the civil wars in Syria and Libya
had several years of acute drought as
antecedents. In the Sahel, erratic rainfall and
prolonged periods of drought have strongly
contributed to the degradation of agricultural
and pastoral land in the face of rapidly increasing
population densities and land governance that
is still largely informal and, in the meantime,
completely outdated. Violent conflicts between
communities, particularly over access to rural
land, have subsequently multiplied, resulting in
the recruitment of young fighters from
abandoned areas by jihadists.


Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

of future instabilities, which we must begin to
anticipate and prepare for. We are already
witnessing a new geopolitical competition,
notably around critical raw materials, which are
necessary for the energy transition and
digitalisation and are therefore increasingly
sought after.


Increasing human expansion into remote
primary ecosystems is not only leading to
accelerated biodiversity loss, but is also resulting
in an increased risk of pandemics, due to
increasingly frequent contact of human

populations with pathogens in wildlife.


As climate change mitigation and adaptation
strategies emerge, it is likely that a gradual
transition from a hydrocarbon-based to a
renewable energy economy will not only
significantly reduce our energy bills, but will also
have a huge economic impact on oil and gas
exporting countries. The resulting decrease in
their relative economic and geopolitical weight
could not only reduce some current tensions,
but also create new ones and represent a source


Potential resulting vulnerabilities should be
prevented by promoting circular economy
models in all industrial sectors, including
defence, allowing for the reuse of components,
materials and resources. Furthermore, it is
essential to establish mutually beneficial
partnerships with countries exporting such
resources, without creating significant
dependencies.

Climate change also affects our country
through the increased frequency and violence
of extreme weather events (droughts, fires,
tornadoes, floods, etc.) affecting our cities and
infrastructures, including critical infrastructures,
and requiring more and more frequent support
from the Luxembourg Armed Forces for rescue,
first aid, civil protection and crisis management
operations. While this assistance has a definite
added value in terms of disaster relief, crisis
management, civil-military coordination and
societal acceptance of the Luxembourg Armed
Forces, the scale and intensity of these events
in turn weaken the capacity for training and
preparation for military tasks.


Finally, the action and effectiveness of the
Luxembourg Armed Forces may also be directly
affected by the consequences of climate change,
whether in the context of extreme weather


-----

Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

phenomena affecting defence infrastructures or
equipment, or in the context of military
operations in extreme weather conditions (heat,
torrential rain, flooding) that greatly reduce the
operational performance of personnel and
equipment.


limited to legitimate military targets but extends
to civilian targets, including critical infrastructure.

**3.2.2 Asymmetric and hybrid**


###### 3.2 Threats

**3.2.1 Conventional and nuclear**


Through its war of aggression against Ukraine,
the Russian Federation has fundamentally
altered the overall security environment and
substantially exacerbated tensions on the
European continent and particularly with NATO
and the EU.

NATO's new Strategic Concept and the EU's
Strategic Compass identify Russia as a primary
and direct security threat leading to a
fundamental shift in posture.


Russia maintains powerful conventional
military assets, and a robust nuclear arsenal,
which pose a threat to the entire Euro-Atlantic
area. Since February 2022, the Russian President
has repeatedly emphasised the relevance of this
threat in his speeches directed towards the
NATO Allies. At the same time, Russia uses a
wider range of hybrid tools on a daily basis,
including offensive cyber assets, disinformation
campaigns, energy blackmail and the
instrumental use of migration flows.

Furthermore, as demonstrated in Ukraine,
the use of Russian military capabilities is not


Terrorism remains the other significant threat
described by NATO's Strategic Concept. It exists
in many forms and it is important to respond to
this threat in a united and supportive manner.
The Luxembourg Defence will strive to contribute
to its mitigation within the framework of its
competences and means.

Hybrid actions are a mixture of coercive and
subversive activities, traditional (e.g. diplomatic,
military, economic) and unconventional (e.g.
misuse of social networks, manipulated
information) methods used in a coordinated
way by state and non-state actors to achieve
certain political objectives, without reaching the
threshold of an officially declared war. The
characteristic of these hybrid actions is that they
are difficult to attribute to a specific actor.
Consequently, the choice of response will be
limited. The fact that these threats cannot at all
times be countered in their entirety, underlines
the importance of the resilience of State tools,
especially in regards of defence.


With the rise of EDTs, these threats are and
will increasingly be able to target and potentially
destabilise societies by degrading public trust in
State institutions, polarising political positions at
national and international levels, denigrating
the fundamental values of democratic societies
and affecting the decision-making capacity of
policy makers.


-----

**3.2.3 Cyber**

In recent years, with the increasing
digitalisation of our society, the cyber domain
has become essential for the proper functioning
of society as well as for the conduct of many
military activities. This increasing dependence
creates vulnerabilities to attacks and
destabilisation attempts. These disruptions can
be described as complex, destructive and
coercive. As these activities are carried out
clandestinely and remotely, they are difficult to
attribute to a specific perpetrator, even if
detected in time. The means to carrying out
attacks are easily accessible and inexpensive,
and therefore make all forms of attacks
particularly attractive and profitable. The main
perpetrators of cyberattacks are States,
organised crime organisations, terrorists, or
ideological activists. Cyber threats can be
classified into six categories according to the


Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

objectives targeted: cybercrime, espionage,
destabilisation (subversive activity in relation to
hybrid threats), sabotage, strategic pre­

positioning or action by isolated individuals.
Today, cyber weapons tend to approach the
lethal potential of conventional weapons. AI and
the misuse of algorithms are beginning to play
a major role in cyberattacks as well as in LAWS.
In addition, there is a closer link between cyber
and space, as seen with the Russian cyberattack
on the satellite communications operator Viasat
immediately prior to the invasion of Ukraine in
2022.


Such attacks, being more and more
destructive, harbour the potential for escalation
which could also lead to the invocation of
Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty (collective
defence).

###### 3.3 Assessment of the strategic environment


The year 2022 was marked by the outbreak
of a high-intensity war of aggression by Russia
against Ukraine, thus in the immediate vicinity
of EU and NATO territory. Since then, Europe has
found itself in an unprecedented strategic
context. The remarkable resistance of the
Ukrainian forces against the Russian aggressor,
supported by a large part of the international
community, has pushed Russia into an
unanticipated strategically difficult situation.
Without exaggeration, this period can be seen
as particularly dangerous. With the capability
imbalance still in Russia's favour against
Ukrainian forces, the war in Ukraine is likely to
be a long-term one with the potential to spread
to other countries. As a result, the overall
situation on the European continent and beyond
is marked by great tension and uncertainty
about future developments in the geopolitical
context. Even if the risk of a confrontation
between NATO and Russia appears to be limited,
it is important to be prepared for a possible
rapid deterioration of the situation.

The Indo-Pacific region has become another
hotbed of tension impacting international
relations in a significant way. We witness the
emergence of an assertive Chinese policy,
oriented towards competition in most areas,
including military. The massive modernisation of
China's military apparatus, notably in terms of
disruptive technologies, constitutes a real
challenge. With the second largest defence
budget in world, Beijing is investing heavily in its
ambitions.


More vigilance will therefore be required as
a profound change in global political and security
stability is increasingly confirmed. Diplomatic
and economic relations will have to be analysed
and reconsidered by including the security and
defence dimensions more prominently. A
redefinition of the common security and defence
policy has become inevitable. A general
strengthening of the operational posture,
including NATO's deterrence posture, must be
become one of the priorities of defence policy.

The scale of the security challenges is
recognised both in the Strategic Compass and in
NATO's new Strategic Concept. This realignment
also concerns Luxembourg, whether it be in
terms of capabilities, operational orientation
and preparedness, the approach to resilience or
inter-ministerial cooperation at national level to
define an integrated response.


Given the size of the Luxembourg Armed
Forces, it must be stressed that not all missions,
both international and domestic, can be carried
out simultaneously. Indeed, if the battalion were
to be engaged abroad, the Armed Forces could
only provide limited support to their national
missions.

While the conventional threat is the obvious
focus of attention, trends with long-term
consequences should not be overlooked. Space
and cyberspace, including social networks, are
not spared and have become the new
battlegrounds. The interconnection between
technological developments, especially EDTs,
and the threats arising from them is already
apparent on the battlefields in Ukraine (e.g.
importance of satellite communications, use of


-----

unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and loitering
munitions). This interconnectedness has the
potential to scale up the effects of asymmetric,
hybrid and cyber threats. The increasing use of
AI will definitely act as a multiplying factor
increasing their harmful impact.

We will be increasingly confronted with these
new threat types, which are favoured in a
context where actors aim to remain below the
threshold of open or easily attributable
hostilities. By their nature, these threats aim to
affect targets beyond the defence domain,
testing the resilience of both society and security
and defence actors at national and international
level.


Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

Apart from the observation that it is causing
an increasing number of military missions on
national territory, the climate crisis or
environmental changes in general, which are
likely to cause a rapid deterioration of the
security situation in many parts of the world, are
likely to lead to more crisis management and
stabilisation missions. At the same time, the
contestation of the rules-based international
order may potentially result in a lack of
agreement on the mandates (especially in the
UN context) framing these missions.


As the number of LAWS is growing, an
adequate and agreed regulatory framework,
taking into account all ethical aspects, becomes
an urgent priority.


It is obvious that the range of threats,
requiring profound transformation processes in
the short, medium and long term, will require a
significant amount of work on the part of the
Luxembourg Defence. Given the number of
challenges, it will be necessary to proceed to a
weighted prioritisation by means of adapted
strategic objectives.

#### The goals of Luxembourg's defence policy


In a changing world, Luxembourg has interests
and values which it chooses to protect through
a principled defence policy and by contributing
to the collective security and defence systems of
which it is a part.

Through its Armed Forces and Defence as a
whole, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg intends
to contribute to the global response of the EU,
NATO, the UN and the OSCE to security and
defence challenges. Each organisation acts, in its
own field and in its own way, in promoting and
defending our common values.


commitments made in the framework of PESCO,
in particular participation in EU crisis
management operations, in EU battlegroups,
the coordination of defence policies, the joint
acquisition and pooling of equipment, joint
training and the strengthening of interoperability
as well as of the deployment capability of
European forces. The Luxembourg Defence will
continue to support the activities of the OSCE,
especially in the field of confidence- and
security-building measures, including in

particular arms control.


Luxembourg Defence will continue to
contribute to key areas and to fair burden
sharing amongst Allies, Member States and
partners.

NATO is the cornerstone of the Euro-Atlantic
security. Today's forces are called upon to
become more robust, responsive and available
to contribute within their means to NATO's
three core tasks – deterrence and collective
defence, crisis prevention and management,
and cooperative security. Among these tasks,
collective defence can be described as “primus
inter pares”. Indeed, the deterrence and defence
posture is and will remain essential to preserve
peace. It is therefore a matter of contributing to
these efforts in peacetime, in order to contribute
to the credibility of the Alliance. For the
European Allies, this means strengthening its
European pillar, and thus the EU, NATO's main
strategic partner. This will be achieved first and
foremost through the implementation of the


Is this enough? The answer is clearly no. The
complexity and scale of the current and potential
challenges and conflicts require a whole-of­
government approach. In the event of a national
crisis, a central role will be played by Luxembourg
Defence under the governance of the High
Commission for National Protection (HCPN).

Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

###### 4.1 Promoting our values internationally


Luxembourg's defence policy promotes, among other things, the rule of law, respect for human
rights, democracy, freedom, international solidarity, sustainable development and the maintenance of
peace and security through an effective multilateral system. Our values guide the actions of our
Defence and are also reflected in the political commitments of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

###### 4.2 Preservation of Luxembourg's essential security interests through the multilateral system based on international law


Luxembourg's defence policy contributes to the protection of Luxembourg's essential security
interests, namely:

safeguarding the integrity of the territory, independence and sovereignty of Luxembourg;


safeguarding the freedom and security of the population in a stable, open and dynamic society;

protection of the foundations of Luxembourg's prosperity, economic security and strategic supplies;

Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

#### Structural principles of Luxembourg's defence policy


###### 5.1 Solidarity

In order to be fully recognised as an EU
Member State and NATO Ally, Luxembourg
cannot delegate the safeguarding of security to
its partners but must instead assume its fair
share of the collective defence effort. The
personnel of the Luxembourg Armed Forces is
the face of our external action in theatres of
operation. Their deployment, with the inherent
risks of an operation, is the highest expression
of our solidarity and fair sharing of risks.


###### 5.2 Decision-making autonomy

Decision-making autonomy relates firstly to
the freedom of strategic policy choices and
secondly to the control of operational activities
and the life cycle of capabilities.


###### 5.3 Transatlantic Partnership

The importance of the transatlantic

partnership, which is based on solidarity
commitments, no longer needs to be

demonstrated in the field of defence. This is why
Defence remains a central link in this transatlantic
bond.


###### 5.4 Adaptability and military specificity

Given the rapid changes in the security
context, the Luxembourg Defence must show
itself capable of agility and reactivity in order to
anticipate and respond rapidly to multinational
initiatives and opportunities for cooperation
that arise. This applies to the organisational,
operational and capability levels.

The adaptability and specificity of the military
profession means that the Luxembourg Armed
Forces cannot be subject to all the same rules
and laws as those applicable to civil servants and
other state agents. This is due to the unique
nature of their missions, which include
emergency response, engagement in
peacekeeping operations as well as combat
readiness. Therefore, specific legislation is
needed to regulate the activities of the military
and to ensure that it can fulfil its obligations
effectively in accordance with applicable
international legal and ethical standards. This
legislation should include specific laws on labour
regulations, military discipline, procedures for
the conduct of operations and military justice
procedures. It is important that this legislation
be reviewed regularly to ensure that it remains
relevant to the ever-changing environment in
which the Luxembourg Armed Forces operate.


-----

Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

###### 5.5 Partnerships and pooling & sharing


Few countries have the capability to conduct
complex operations of significant scale on their
own. Given our structural limitations, our
international partnerships of reference –
Belgium, The Netherlands, France Germany and
the United States of America as well as NATO
Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA),
European Defence Agency (EDA), Organisation
for Joint Armament Co-operation (OCCAr), etc.
– are essential. These partnerships will guarantee
our operational and mutual added value, as well
as of our credibility.

Without being exhaustive, it is worth
mentioning Luxembourg's participation in multi­
national programmes such as the A400M, MultiRole Tanker Transport (MRTT), Allied Ground
Surveillance (AGS), Airborne Warning and
Control System (AWACS), which are realities
today and continue to grow in importance. They
allow us to meet the ambitions and requirements
of both NATO and the EU.

###### 5.6 Commitment to Luxembourg society


allocated to it. As shown by the numerous
interventions of the Luxembourg Armed Forces
at national level in recent years, Defence fulfils
its role to support the population in case of
major incidents such as extreme weather events.
Defence also secures the population on a daily
basis by fulfilling its mission of removing and
desposing of munitions from the two world
wars. At the same time, Defence maintains its
commitment to the successful transition of
volunteers from the military to the private and
public sector after their military service. Finally,
Defence also regularly contributes to the duty of
remembrance.

###### 5.7 Foreign and security policy of the “3D”


Defence is an integral part of Luxembourg
society. Under the control of the Parliament,
Defence ensures the transparent and responsible
management of the important resources


Luxembourg traditionally applies a holistic
approach to security and defence issues,
favouring a mutually supportive method in a
multilateral system that combines diplomacy,
development cooperation and defence –
commonly referred to as the “3D”-concept and
fully in line with the Common Foreign and
Security Policy (CFSP) (which advocates an
“integrated approach”). The Luxembourg
Defence, one of the nodes of the EU’s Common
Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), of NATO's
common defence policy and necessarily of the
Grand Duchy's foreign and security policy which,
in complementarity with the means of traditional
diplomacy and development cooperation policy,


-----

Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035


contributes to conflict prevention and postconflict reconstruction. In this respect,
Luxembourg attaches particular importance to
modes of action that are not solely military, and
contributes to the development of capabilities
that enable third countries to ensure their own
security in accordance with our values.

Today, with the emergence of hybrid
aggressions, this traditional approach needs to
be complemented by a range of other
instruments in view of the complexity of threats
and drivers of instability. It is essential to support
an integrated approach that brings together all
relevant state instruments to respond to a crisis.
The range of these instruments includes
diplomatic, economic, communication, financial,
intelligence, legal, environmental and internal
security instruments.

Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035


#### Goals to be achieved


The overall objective will be to develop
capabilities, first and foremost force elements,
in the readiness categories, required to operate
in the various security contexts, in order to
participate primarily in the achievement of
NATO’s and EU’s level of ambition.

It should be made clear that a capability is not
just about equipment, but also includes relevant
dimensions such as doctrine, organisation,
training, interoperability, human and budgetary
resources, infrastructure and the necessary
command and management structures.


###### 6.1 At the organisational level

The Luxembourg Armed Forces will have to
increase their manpower in order to have a
sufficient mass of military personnel, available
quickly, for an extended period of time and
capable of operating in a multipurpose manner.
The level of ambition in terms of operational
availability of personnel will be oriented
according to the requirements of the new rapid
reaction mechanisms being developed, both on
the NATO and EU sides.


In addition to the “traditional missions” of
the Luxembourg Defence, namely ISR activities,
which will be further developed, the Luxembourg
Defence has specialised in recent years in the
air, space and cyber domains, thus contributing
to the defence against new threats and types of
risk. Indeed, particular attention is dedicated to
cyber threats as well as to security risks related
to the impacts and implications of global
environmental changes, notably including
climate change. As a result, these specialisations
will be further strengthened and developed in
the coming years.

Logically, the objectives are not set in stone
and may evolve according to the volatility of the
security environment, whether international or
national, within the limits of legal constraints –
procurement laws – and budgetary constraints.
Finally, one has to consider the human resources
aspect.


continues to develop its communication
capability to inform on defence policy,
commitments in multilateral institutions,

bi-national cooperation, the defence effort, the
use of resources, the activities of the Directorate
of Defence and the Armed Forces, the scope of
strategic issues, the deterrence and defence
posture, and decisions on operational
commitments – always within the security
constraints. At the same time, these
communication capabilities will also be used to
counter hostile information activities and
particularly disinformation.


In light of the current international dynamics,
the foresight function will be strengthened
through a more appropriate presence in the EU
and NATO structures. Such an effort will also
contribute to a better burden sharing.

The Luxembourg Defence, as a whole,


-----

Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

The Luxembourg Armed Forces will strengthen
their command and support capabilities to
ensure the planning, preparation and conduct
of several simultaneous but limited engagements
in different contexts. Parallel engagements on
the eastern and southern flanks of the European
continent are considered possible. At the same
time, it remains possible to provide support to
the nation on national soil. In short, this is part
of a 360 degree approach, adapted to the
capabilities of the Luxembourg Defence.


Defence continues to complete the capability
development function that applies international
best practices and meets national requirements.

In view of the increased complexity of the
equipment and the operational environment,
the training and education areas are further
developed to ensure the operational
maintenance of capabilities. This includes the
development of simulation and the diversification
of training grounds in Luxembourg and abroad.


line with that of our partners. This robustness
includes the ability to operate in urban areas
and in severe climatic conditions.

However, given the often unfathomable
consequences of rapid and far-reaching
technological developments, the Luxembourg
Defence regularly reviews its capability portfolio
in the different areas of operations, verifies that
its capabilities are fit for purpose and analyses
whether there are capability solutions that
better match this portfolio or are more efficient.


###### 6.2 In terms of capability

The Luxembourg Defence pursues a sound
capability development policy, consisting of
increasing the responsiveness, combat power,
resilience and networked operation of its
capabilities and their respective supports, and
developing capabilities, preferably dual-use,
that contribute to improving this robustness in


Further specialisation in one or another
capability niche carries the risk of a loss of
decision-making autonomy. Similarly, this would
have resulted in a lack of flexibility in the
commitment of the available units. Moreover,
advanced specialisation focuses on support
capabilities, whereas, in order to honour the
principle of solidarity, each Ally is obliged to
provide kinetic capabilities capable of operating
in a high-intensity context.

Responsiveness is the ability of a capability to
be operationally available within the timeframe
required to fulfil its mission or function. The
higher the required responsiveness, the faster
the capability must be available.


Combat power is the ability to participate
together with our partners in the domination of
an operational situation. This requires a high
degree of interoperability with our partners, a
capacity for rapid change of posture, including


-----

escalation and de-escalation, and therefore,
depending on the context, also an offensive
capability.

Resilience is the ability to continue operating
in a degraded environment. It requires, among
other things, extensive individual training
including ethics, hardiness training, trust in
command and a group dynamic that places
mission success as the top priority. Equipment
resilience is about maintaining performance in a
degraded environment. The resilience factor is
paramount in the face of evolving threats.
Climate change is likely to have a significant
impact on the performance of capabilities
operating in climate degraded conditions,
thereby increasing vulnerabilities and operational
risks.


Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

###### 6.3 At the operational level


Networking is the ability to connect and
participate fully in the activities of the network.

“Dual-use” refers to capabilities that have
both civilian and military applications. Dual-use
capabilities are favoured in the choices made by
Defence to consolidate its capability profile. The
aim of this approach is also to strengthen
Luxembourg's resilience. It must be recognised,
however, that many of the Luxembourg Armed
Forces' requirements arising from NATO and EU
planning do not qualify as dual-use capabilities.


**Contributions to crisis management and**
**collective defence operations**

The Luxembourg Defence will continue to
participate in peace-keeping and conflict
prevention missions and operations, as well as
in crisis management. Luxembourg's contribution
may take the form of deployments of military or
civilian personnel, military capabilities or
financial contributions, in compliance with the
criteria of usability of forces defined by NATO or
the EU.

The Luxembourg Defence will continue to
participate in exercises and deployments
designed to strengthen the deterrence and
defence posture through an advanced presence
in Alliance countries, in close cooperation with
our key partners, thus illustrating solidarity
among Allies.

The Luxembourg Defence will contribute to
EU and NATO rapid reaction forces. Relevant
norms and standards will be applied, including
in the preparation phase. A substantial
contribution will be considered at regular
intervals, in principle every four to five years,
taking into account the planning of our key
partners.

Close cooperation with the Grand Ducal
Police is also necessary in this context. NATO
requires the provision of military police elements
that can be deployed in different theatres of
operation.


-----

Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

**Performing national missions**


The Luxembourg Armed Forces will maintain
the resources required to carry out its legislated
national missions. Recent natural disasters as
well as the COVID-19 pandemic have confirmed
the importance of the Armed Forces' support in
dealing with such national contingencies.

Defence will contribute to the fulfilment of
Luxembourg's obligations as a host nation. In
particular, Luxembourg will contribute to
improving military mobility in Europe, a key
element of the integrated approach, by
facilitating the rapid deployment of personnel
and equipment of Allies and Member States
passing through Luxembourg.

The Luxembourg Defence will contribute to
strengthening national resilience, including
through the protection against hybrid threats
and cyber threats.

**Conflict prevention**


including through training and equipment
support. Defence will contribute also by the
means of experts and instructors who can be
made available to international operations.

**Stabilisation**


Stabilisation[3] is a particularly important
aspect of the restitution of civil society, which is
often severely affected by conflicts. Here too,
Luxembourg is committed to bringing together
experts from outside Defence who are able to
intervene in crisis areas, within the framework
of multilateral initiatives. The Luxembourg
Defence will be able to support the preparation
and deployment of these experts, while
contributing to their protection.

**Humanitarian aid**


While most of the work undertaken in conflict
prevention does not fall under the responsibility
of the military, the Luxembourg Defence can
contribute to these efforts through its ISR
capabilities that provide early warning and
document factual situations on the ground. In
the area of conflict prevention, Defence will
contribute to efforts to support partner countries
to take responsibility for their own security,


In accordance with the European Consensus
on Humanitarian Aid, under very specific
circumstances and in line with the 2007 Oslo
Directive on the use of foreign military and civil
protection assets in disaster relief, humanitarian
aid may rely on military assets, in particular for
logistical and infrastructural support mainly in
the case of natural disasters. It is imperative that
humanitarian principles (neutrality, humanity,
impartiality and independence) are preserved in
such cases. Defence will continue to make its
airlift capabilities available for humanitarian
purposes.


3 NATO refers to stabilisation and reconstruction in its defence planning. It should be noted that reconstruction activities are not
within the remit of the Luxembourg Defence.


-----

The Luxembourg Armed Forces may also be
entrusted with humanitarian aid tasks, both
nationally and internationally. These tasks
include, in particular, assistance to other public
administrations and to the population in cases
of major public interest or disasters. Furthermore,
such tasks may be an integral part of the
mandates of peacekeeping and crisis
management operations and missions to which
the Armed Forces are requested to contribute.
This will be done in coordination with the
ministry in charge of the coordination and
implementation of humanitarian action policy,
where appropriate, in the framework of a
coordination platform established for this
purpose.


Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

###### 6.4 Defence effort


The Luxembourg Defence, respecting its
commitments within the NATO and the EU,
pursues the objective of remaining a supportive
and reliable partner. Consequently, Luxembourg's
defence effort will grow substantially during this
decade.

In response to this general objective, defence
efforts will be pursued, based on the principle
of reasonable, sustainable and fair effort, in a
proportion comparable to the efforts of its non­
nuclear European partners. This forecast on the
defence effort will require the maintenance of a
substantial investment effort, while ensuring a
balanced budget structure between investments
and operation.


-----

Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

These Guidelines will orient Luxembourg’s
Directorate of Defence and Armed Forces with
a view to progressively increase the defence
effort to 1% of GDP, at the earliest by 2028, and
to maintain it at this level while ensuring that a
realistic level of ambition is maintained as a
continuation of current efforts and taking into
account available or potential human and
material resources.


It should also be noted that in response to EU
expectations, the Grand Duchy will allocate the
equivalent of 2% of its defence effort to research
and development from 2023 onwards.

###### 6.5 Prevention of security risks related to environmental changes


In June 2022, the broad outlines of the
evolution of Luxembourg's defence effort were
unveiled, envisaging the following growth

related challenges, it has a role to play in a global
response to climate change. For example, the
EU and NATO have taken into account the
security impact of climate change in their recent
strategic documents.

NATO sees climate change as “a defining
_challenge of our time, that has a profound_
_impact on Allied security. It is a crisis and threat_
_multiplier”. At the Madrid Summit in 2022,_
heads of State and government endorsed the
Secretary General's proposals to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions from NATO's political
and military structures and facilities by at least
45% by 2030 and to achieve “net zero” by 2050,
while maintaining operational, military and
economic effectiveness. We will therefore
integrate climate change considerations into all
NATO’s core tasks related activities.


Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

Allies to establish a balance sheet of its direct
and indirect greenhouse gas emissions using a
methodology commonly used in industry. While
emissions from operating buildings will be
significantly reduced in the coming years, thanks
to innovative technologies available on the
market, it is difficult to reduce emissions from
the purchase of goods and services and from
aviation activities until carbon-neutral
technologies and fuels are available.


At the Brussels Summit in 2021, NATO had
already adopted a Climate Change and Security
Action Plan in which it agreed on climate change
adaptation and mitigation measures, including
the objective of developing a methodology to
measure and map greenhouse gas emissions
from military activities and facilities. In addition
to helping Allies formulate voluntary targets for
reducing emissions from their military activities,
such a methodology could also inform their
future investment decisions and contribute to
their operational planning.

In 2021, the Luxembourg Defence, as a
forerunner in this field, was one of the very first


While there are technologies available on the
market to mitigate certain types of emissions
(e.g. greenhouse gas emissions from buildings),
they are still sorely lacking when it comes to
reducing emissions from mobile combustion.

The response of the Luxembourg Defence to
the major challenge of environmental change,
including climate change, will comprise the
following four strategic axes, with the aim of:


contributing, within the EU and NATO, to
better understanding, anticipating and
adapting to the security and defence
implications of environmental change;

and the preservation of the possibility of

The increasing complexity of technologies
and the different security contexts make it
necessary to involve our partners earlier and on
the long term, whether to harmonise
requirements, acquire equipment, train
together, share capabilities or use the same
capabilities in operations. In concrete terms,
this means integrating Luxembourg personnel
into the structures of our partners, as it has
already been implemented with the Belgian and
Dutch armed forces and, in the near future, with
the French armed forces.


Finally, the integration of our capabilities with
those of our partners guarantees interoperability

Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

A higher proportion of women is clearly
recognised as a key factor for success, both in
achieving operational objectives in the field and
in promoting interest in the military profession.
The Luxembourg Defence supports programmes
to develop the role of women in conflict
resolution. In its Resolution 2282 (2016) the UN
is: “reaffirming the important role of women in
_peacebuilding and noting the substantial link_
_between_ _women’s_ _full_ _and_ _meaningful_
_involvement in efforts to prevent, resolve and_
_rebuild from conflict and those efforts’_
_effectiveness and long term sustainability, and_
_stressing, in this regard, the importance of_
_women’s equal participation in all efforts for the_
_maintenance and promotion of peace and_
_security and the need to increase women’s role_
_in decision-making with regard to conflict_
_prevention and resolution and peacebuilding”._


The demographic structure of the Luxembourg
Defence is still far from the realities of society.
The rate of feminisation of the defence personnel
is only about 10%, all categories of personnel
included. Consequently, the Luxembourg
Defence intends to better target this group in
future recruitment campaigns.


###### 6.8 Supporting research and industry

In order to ensure that the technological
advantage is maintained, particular importance
must be attached to measures supporting
innovation. Defence will further develop the
ongoing cooperation with the ministries
responsible for the Luxembourg economy and
research, as well as with actors such as
Luxinnovation and the Luxembourg National
Research Fund (FNR – Fonds national de la
recherche).


-----

Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

These collaborations have enabled the
Luxembourg Defence to launch, in 2022, the
first national call for research and development
projects in the field of defence, particularly for
dual-use capabilities. The aim of this initiative is
to facilitate market access to national actors
with little or no experience in defence, while
they try to position themselves as precursors in
certain technological niches.


intensify cooperation through joint projects;

closing gaps and meeting capability targets;


stimulate innovation, including through civilmilitary synergies; and


The involvement of Defence in the EU and
NATO initiatives mentioned above will be
increased to the benefit of research and
development, one of the pillars of Luxembourg’s
Defence. The actors targeted by this call for
projects are SMEs, start-ups, but also research
centres and any other national entity capable of
carrying out research and development work.

In March 2022, the EU heads of State and
government, meeting in Versailles, committed
themselves to strengthening European defence
capabilities in the face of the Russian military
aggression against Ukraine. They agreed to:


strengthen and develop the defence industry,
including SMEs.

The joint European Commission and European
Defence Agency (EDA) analysis of the 2022
defence investment gap has identified capability
gaps which they recommend should be urgently
addressed, building on the solutions that the
European defence industry can provide. The
resulting capability priorities cover air, maritime,
land, space and cyber as well as military
mobility[6]. The vast majority of them are among
the priorities of the Luxembourg Defence, which
participates in numerous European and
international initiatives on these subjects.


The EU has proposed several tools to
strengthen the competitiveness of the European
Defence Technological and Industrial Base

6 land: expansion of the existing stock of main battle tanks and armoured combat vehicles as well as development of new generation
systems, strengthening of land combat capabilities and anti-tank systems and artillery platforms;
air: development of air-to-air refueling capabilities, air defence, anti-drone capabilities and multi-role combat aircraft;
sea: strengthening force projection capabilities, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities and the protection of
maritime lines of communication;
space: investments in secure satellite connectivity, quantum encryption, Earth observation from space, protection of the EU's
space infrastructure and all early warning systems;
cyber: building a full-spectrum cyber defence capability from search and detection to protection and response to active defence
capabilities;
military mobility: maintenance, sustainment and movement of forces, equipment and supplies under the European Interconnection
Facility (EIF).

Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035


#### Priority capability development areas

The Luxembourg Defence will continue to
participate in multinational capability
programmes – whether in a pooling & sharing
framework or not – which can either be used
directly by the Armed Forces or constitute a
contribution by Luxembourg in the framework
of its international commitments.


###### 7.1 Land

In general, the Luxembourg Armed Forces,
and in particular its Land Force, will continue to
develop ISR capabilities capable of operating
both in a crisis management and collective
defence framework. The manoeuvre elements
are also supposed to have the necessary logistic
support capabilities for the execution of the
different missions.


The NDPP) and the EU’s Capability
Development Plan (CDP) remain the key
references to guide national capability
development. Based on the priorities identified
and the capability goals derived from these
iterative processes, a lot of work is underway or
about to start in the different areas.

The Coordinated Annual Review on Defence
(CARD), an additional tool within the EU that has
recently been added, facilitates the identification
of partners and potential synergies between EU
Member States and partners.


After the signature of two declarations of
intent in 2021 and 2022, Luxembourg and
Belgium are aiming for a bi-national cooperation
agreement in 2023 to meet the NATO capability
goal requiring the creation and joint operation
of a medium combat reconnaissance battalion.
By the term “medium” it should be understood
first of all that this unit will be based on a family
of more robust wheeled vehicles, as is being
acquired by Belgium in the framework of the
Franco-Belgian strategic partnership called
CaMo[8 ] and closely linked to the French
SCORPION programme.[9 ]


The Land Force, aiming to introduce

doctrine being developed under the auspices of
France.


The future Belgian-Luxembourg
reconnaissance battalion will be essential for
Luxembourg to enable its reconnaissance forces
to integrate into the rapidly developing
structures of both NATO and the EU, which are
primarily intended for collective defence.
Maximising the interoperability of forces will
logically be a key area of work over the coming
decade. In addition, there will be a significant
recruitment effort in order to have the necessary
military personnel to carry out the Luxembourg
[share of the bi-national battalion.[10] The](https://battalion.10)
aforementioned cooperation agreement aims at
harmonising the budgetary and capability
planning of the two countries' Defences. The
achievement of the Luxembourg government's
objective of a substantial increase of the defence
effort, aiming at 1% of GDP by 2028, will directly
depend on this.

In addition to enhanced Belgian-Luxembourg
military cooperation, a very close partnership
with France will be essential to guarantee
Luxembourg's access to the required technology
and thus ensure that this future capability lives
up to expectations. The signature of the abovementioned cooperation agreement will
definitively launch this future major military
capability programme which will give birth to


this battalion. Aiming at a strength of around
700 military personnel, they will be grouped
initially into four reconnaissance companies,
two of which will be Luxembourgish,
supplemented by various bi-national support
elements. During an initial phase, between 2025
and 2028, key Luxembourg personnel will be
seconded to Belgium or even to France, to the
competent headquarters, in order to set up the
unit quickly. By 2030, the heart of the bi-national
unit will be located in Arlon while maintaining a
strong presence in the Grand Duchy. In concrete
terms, branches with various force, support and
back-up elements are supposed to be added in
Belgium and Luxembourg. The sites in question
will be located in Marche-en-Famenne and
Diekirch, supplemented by additional logistic
structures in the south of the Grand Duchy. In
the long term, this bi-national unit is supposed
to operate in both collective defence and crisis
management frameworks, either by means of
joint tactical sub-units or in a constituted
manner.

In addition to the reinstatement of mediumrange anti-tank capabilities and the introduction
of the Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC)
capability to enable the evolution of ISR
capabilities to ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance,
Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance), the
Land Force will field capabilities to improve

climatic condition zones and contaminated
environments.

The Land Force will evolve its tactical UAVs to
integrate them into high spectrum operations.
They could be attached to a partner's unit,
depending on the engagement framework and
possible opportunities. A replacement of the
tactical UAVs in service would be envisaged
around 2028, taking into account the rapid
technological evolution of such capabilities.

The water purification capability will be
upgraded to meet NATO requirements. It may
be attached to a partner's unit, where possible,
in line with the new deterrence and defence
plans.


The demining capability will be regenerated
to comply with NATO requirements. It will be
able to be attached to a partner's unit in line
with the new deterrence and defence plans,
without encroaching on the remaining national
missions in this respect.

###### 7.2 Air

While the commitment of Defence and more
particularly of the Luxembourg Armed Forces in
the air domain is still limited, especially in terms
of volume and human resources, its impact will
be all the more significant in terms of growth of
the defence effort and high added value
operational contributions.


The A400M and A330 MRTT strategic air
capabilities are expected to reach full operational
capability by early 2025 and will evolve in
common agreement with our partners involved
in these programmes. At the latest during the
next decade, first upgrades will have to be
considered.


The Airborne Early Warning & Control
(AEW&C) programme, including some 15 AWACS
aircraft, has commited Luxembourg for four
decades. The ageing fleet will have to be
replaced in the coming years. In addition to
fulfilling its obligations to NATO, Luxembourg
may be able to develop synergies with national
space capabilities or even other high-tech
industries in developing a replacement system,
– the Alliance Future Surveillance and Control
(AFSC) – to meet future requirements.

The Luxembourg Defence will continue its
substantial support to the AGS programme,
including the provision of the necessary
bandwidth to implement this strategic Alliance
capability.


-----

In addition to these strategic assets, lighter
platforms could be added to the fleets, e.g. in
cooperation with the Benelux countries or the
FNC. In this context, the continuous provision of
strategic medical evacuation capabilities, using
a service provider, should also be mentioned.

Building on operational contributions and
particularly rewarding experiences made since
2009 in various theatres, the Luxembourg
Defence will continue its efforts in the field of
maritime air surveillance using contracted
aircraft. The latter could also support land-based
engagements in various contexts. Allied exercises
(e.g. Unified Vision), focusing on the
interoperability of a range of sensors, are an
appropriate environment for identifying and
developing inter-force synergies.

On the basis of the above, opportunities for
the acquisition of complementary air capabilities,
or even additional participation in multinational
programmes, will be assessed primarily from
the point of view of NATO capability objectives
but also in response to critical EU, EATC, Benelux,


bi-national or even national capability
requirements and priorities. A greater implication
of the Luxembourg industry may event result
from these defence investment opportunities.

The Luxembourg Defence will explore
opportunities to join joint programmes to
strengthen the Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD)
defence.

In the medium term, the above-mentioned
efforts will necessarily be part of an overall
framework to be developed in close coordination
with our reference partners, ultimately to the
benefit of the EU's enhanced strategic autonomy
and the key requirements identified by NATO
through the NDPP.

The Luxembourg Defence will contribute to
the execution of search and rescue (SAR)
missions with H-145M helicopters by 2025. In
the medium term, Luxembourg Defence will
assess opportunities to develop military use of
its H-145M capability. Bi-national cooperation
with an allied country will be part of this analysis.

Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

###### 7.3 Space


Space offers unprecedented opportunities
for development and progress. However, the
increasing dependence of our societies on space
for their day-to-day functioning also generates
vulnerabilities. Like cyber defence, space will
gain in importance as a key national security
issue.

Luxembourg Defence will strive to implement
the sector strategy described in the first Defence
Space Strategy of 2022. This strategy defines
concrete objectives for Defence in order to
consolidate Luxembourg's role as a reference
partner in the field of space, both nationally and
internationally, by strengthening existing
capabilities and developing new ones.
Luxembourg, having its own space capabilities,
can have a significant impact and thus provide
its fair share to the overall security and defence
effort.


technologies to partners who respect
international law and human rights.

The long-term objective of the space defence
policy requires useful, sustainable, efficient
space capabilities, governed by Defence and, as
far as possible, implemented by the Luxembourg
Armed Forces. Four development axes have
been set:

consolidate current space capabilities –
communication, observation and navigation
– increase their resilience and develop new
systems;

support freedom of action in and from space;

foster national and international cooperation;

attract and secure a skilled and motivated
workforce.


Particular attention is being paid to the
development of dual-use capabilities and the
use of such in accordance with international law.
In order to promote responsible behaviour in
outer space and in support of the United
Kingdom's initiative within the framework of the
UN to develop norms of responsible behaviour
in outer space, Defence will continue to limit
access to Luxembourg's sensitive space

11 between 52 degrees North and 52 degrees South.


In order to meet the increasing requirements,
both nationally and internationally, and with the
positive feedback from the GovSat public-private
partnership, Luxembourg Defence will continue
the efforts started in the field of secure satellite
communications. Similarly, the Luxembourg
Armed Forces will continue to develop its own
capabilities in this regard, such as projectable
support teams.

Participation in the Wideband Global Satellite
Communications System (WGS) programme will
continue. Through the Medium Earth Orbit
Global Services (MGS) programme, Luxembourg
Defence will have access to a significant amount
[of globally distributed O3b mPOWER capability.[11 ]](https://capability.11)


-----

In parallel, Luxembourg Defence will ensure
the implementation of the Luxembourg Earth
Observation System (LUX EOSys) and will closely
monitor both technical developments and
future needs.

Within the framework of Space Situational
Awareness (SSA), Luxembourg Defence will
strengthen cooperation with partner countries,


in particular Germany, to develop these
capabilities.

###### 7.4 Cyber


In 2021, the Directorate of Defence published
the first cyber defence strategy, which guides
the work in this field over a ten-year horizon.
The document is part of the national cybersecurity
strategy and aims to strengthen the resilience of
Luxembourg's defence.

To this end, the strategy focuses on improving
personnel skills, building national resilience in


cyberspace, supporting private sector capabilities
and strengthening our engagement with our
Allies and partners.

The long-term objective of the strategy is to
ensure that Luxembourg has one of the most
secure cyber defences through the maximisation
of cyber defence capabilities.


Cyber defence is in the process of forging its
place in the Luxembourg Armed Forces and in
the Grand Duchy's cyber security landscape. The

and cyber defence strategy, will strengthen and
increase Luxembourg's capability to address
national and international challenges such as
cyber threats and will also create the necessary
skills to develop innovative cyber security and
cyber defence solutions. The centre will carry
out research, teaching and awareness-raising
activities and will be complementary to the
cyber security policy chair recently established
by the Directorate of Defence and the University
of Luxembourg. The chair will focus on more
policy-oriented issues such as legal and political
aspects at the intersection of digital technologies
and networks, data protection, cybercrime,
cyber defence, contract law, intellectual property
law and human rights.


Mapping a “Cyber Futures” landscape,
identifying priorities and initiating a research
programme.

It should be noted that since the official
inauguration of the Cyber Range platform in
October 2021, its promotion to national and
international partners has resulted in interesting
use cases and collaborations. In order to
promote these efforts and increase visibility, the
Cyber Range platform is now listed in the
Luxembourg Cybersecurity Portal and has its
[own website.[12 ]](https://website.12)


The Directorate of Defence and the University
of Luxembourg, in collaboration with other
public and private stakeholders, have launched
a project to set up a National Centre of
Competence in Cyber Security and Cyber
Defence Research. This competence centre,
aligned with the government's cyber security

[12 https://www.cyber-range.lu](https://www.cyber-range.lu)


Considering the progression of digital
transformation and the need to protect
information throughout its life cycle, it is
necessary to have a high-performance
environment offering sufficient guarantees in
terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability,
as well as calculation and storage capabilities
that can be easily adjusted to the evolving needs
of the beneficiaries. To this end, Luxembourg
Defence has launched, in close cooperation with
the NSPA, a project to set up a private cloud for
data storage and processing, called Luxembourg
Cyber Defence Cloud (LCDC).

#### Additional and complementary efforts


The achievement of the objectives arising
from the priority areas of capability development
goes hand in hand with activities, work or
contributions that facilitate, or even are essential
to their achievement. These efforts also
contribute significantly to the credibility of the
Grand Duchy as a credible, supportive and
reliable Ally, Member State and partner. The
brand image and therefore the attractiveness of
Luxembourg Defence and more particularly of
its Armed Forces depend directly on this.

###### 8.1 Strategic communication


and other strategic documents should be seen
as means to implement this strategic
communication.

###### 8.2 International headquarters and multinational organisations


In a world where the information environment
is increasingly contested, a strategic approach to
communication will be paramount. The
communication efforts of the Luxembourg
Defence will be in line with the ambitious efforts
set out in this document and in other strategic
references, both internally and externally,
towards the general public, partners, Allies, EU
Member States and other identified relevant
actors. Strategic communication will actively
contribute to deterrence efforts by conveying
the message of credible defence. Based on a
factual narrative, strategic communication will
also aim to counter hostile information activities,
in particular disinformation. These guidelines

The inclusion of personnel in various
command and control structures, whether in
NATO, EU, UN or other bodies, such as the
European Corps[13], the EATC, or the NATO Space
Center of Excellence[14], is a direct obligation of
the Luxembourg Armed Forces' international
missions as laid down by law. In general, these
efforts can be combined with many NATO
capability goals and, in addition, contribute to
the EU's strategic autonomy. Such contributions,
whether permanent or limited in duration, to
the multilateral and bilateral cooperation of
which the Grand Duchy is a part, will be
preserved or even developed by taking into
account first of all the contributions of force
elements or capabilities. Priorities will be defined
according to the nature of the commitment, the
theatre of operation, the evolution of the
security situation in general and in particular, as
well as the resources available.

###### 8.3 Verification and monitoring of the implementation of multinational treaties

Through daily cooperation at the level of the
Benelux countries, the Luxembourg Armed
Forces will pursue their efforts to participate in
the verification and monitoring of the execution
of international treaties to which the Grand
Duchy of Luxembourg is part of. The Benelux
Arms Control Agency (BACA) is the tool created
for this purpose in 2014. Its mandate includes
the implementation of conventional arms
controls abroad in order to provide a clear and
transparent picture of the number of sites
housing weapons and military equipment.
Through this cooperation, the Benelux holds a
group of specialised military personnel who are
committed to arms control.


Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

intended for very specific engagements requiring
larger medical structures.


The COVID-19 crisis revealed that health
systems were not optimally prepared to deal
with a large-scale health crisis. As a result, the
Ministry of Health decided to strengthen health
resilience and medical and health education.
The Directorate of Defence will support these
enhanced resilience efforts.

Luxembourg Defence will continue to provide
aeromedical evacuation capabilities to the EATC
and will continue its efforts to support the EMC
in Koblenz and the co-funding of a medical
facility for the Kosovo Force (KFOR).


###### 8.4 Military medecine

Based on a concept developed by the
Directorate of Defence, the Luxembourg Armed
Forces will develop, in close cooperation with
Belgium and France, a Medical Surgical Team
(Med-ST) capability in accordance with NATO
requirements. Since this is a deployable
capability, it is important to underline that this
is not related to the medical support that will be
provided to the future bi-national battalion.
Indeed, this highly specialised capability is


The future capability programme for the
bi-national battalion will necessarily also address
the issue of medical support in a high-intensity
environment, giving priority to joint solutions
with Belgium and France.

###### 8.5 Military mobility


In addition to the dimension of logistical
support for the bi-national battalion, the
creation of a _Multimodal Military Hub (M3H)_
will be part of the EU's capability development
mechanism, in which enhanced military mobility,
both outside and within the EU, is a focus area.
In the wake of this logic, Luxembourg is involved
in the PESCO project Network of Logistic Hubs


-----

Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

in Europe and Support to Operations. The
central objective of this project is to establish
and operate a network of Logistics Hubs (or
LogHubs) in Europe. In a wider context, shaped
by the redesign of the deterrence and defence
posture on the European continent, a
Luxembourg M3H could potentially be used a
key link in terms of host nation support or transit
support within the reinforcement and support
network established for the benefit of NATO
forces. In concrete terms, this capability will aim
to facilitate the activation, reinforcement and
sustainment of Alliance forces when required.


###### 8.6 Infrastructures and support

The Directorate of Defence, in close
collaboration with the Luxembourg Armed
Forces, the Public Building Administration, the
National Roads Administration and other key
partners, will continue or launch the necessary
renovation or construction work on the Grand
Duchy's military infrastructure. Thus, work is
underway or about to begin on the _Caserne_
_Grand-Duc Jean, as well as on the ammunition_
depot and the Army's shooting range.


All of this work will be carried out in
accordance with sustainable development
criteria.

The Luxembourg Defence, together with the
partners concerned – e.g. Warehouses Service
Agency (W.S.A.), NSPA, Luxembourg Airport –


will also develop capabilities to better meet its
role as a host or transit nation.

On the basis of the bi-national cooperation
agreement with Belgium on the establishment
and joint operation of the medium combat
reconnaissance battalion, various infrastructure
synergies will be possible on both Belgian and
Luxembourg soil.

Luxembourg Defence is pursuing the goal of
acquiring and leasing more land for training
purposes.

As the host country of the NSPA, Luxembourg
has a particular interest in ensuring that the
accommodation conditions in the Grand Duchy
enable the agency to carry out the tasks
entrusted to it by the Alliance.

In the context of the evolving needs of the
NSPA, in particular following the expansion of its
mission since 1st April 2015, an adaptation of
the Capellen site to the current and future
needs of the agency has proved necessary.
Therefore, the Agency Supervisory Board of
June 2019 gave a positive advice on the fivephase strategic infrastructure programme to
redevelop the site by 2035.

The agency is the project manager for the
infrastructure programme. Luxembourg, as host
country of the NSPA, assumes the role of
delegated project manager and assists the NSPA
in the realisation of this major project, while
bearing two thirds of the construction costs, in
accordance with the commitment made by
Luxembourg in the headquarter agreement.

### Challenges

To ensure its continued contribution to the
common effort of deterrence and collective
defence, the Luxembourg Defence is conditioned
by the ability to evolve and adapt, often rapidly.
Therefore, political commitment with a clear
long-term vision is key, as well as continuous
arbitration between objectives and available
resources. One of the conditions for making the
most of the momentum for transformation is
skillful prioritisation, mitigating risks and
ensuring the commitment of Defence personnel.
The logic of the investments made requires that
the capabilities are effectively used for the
purpose and along the lines of government
policy.


Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

of rapid reaction, deterrence and defence
mechanisms. Enhanced NATO-EU
complementarity and cooperation are
considered essential. The third joint declaration
of the two organisations is a step in the right
direction to maintain coherence.


The Luxembourg Defence will continue to
evolve through different forms of cooperation in
large multinational groups. We will harmonise
our strategic horizon with that of our partners.
In the name of interoperability, integration and
the pooling of functions and capabilities lead to
an increasing interdependence of partners. The
challenge is to preserve a sufficient degree of
autonomy in the future. The commitment of an
essential part of the Land Force to the bi-national
battalion will make this challenge all the more
important.

The Luxembourg Defence will continue to
lean on the planning mechanisms of NATO and
the EU. In view of the structural limitations of
Defence, it is essential that Luxembourg's
capability development is in line with the
ambition levels of both the EU and the Alliance.
In the face of multiple security challenges, both
organisations are striving for a complete review


The Luxembourg Defence will have to strive
to maintain a sufficiently diversified range of
capabilities to meet the commitments made
and to constitute a margin of manoeuvre
allowing for political choices in terms of
contributions. This capability profile must
constitute a set that remains functional and
resilient in the long term, even under the
constraint of continuous operational
commitments, in downgraded mode and in a
high intensity setting.

###### 9.1 Human Resources


In ordertofulfiltheirmissions, the Luxembourg
Armed Forces require sufficient numbers of
equipped, instructed, trained, and available
personnel.

While the activities of the Luxembourg Armed
Forces have increased considerably, the number
of personnel has remained relatively stable.
Similarly, we are now witnessing an increasing
complexity of the military profession. To a large
extent, the versatility required in the positions
to be filled is less and less compatible with the
requirements of Defence. There is every reason


-----

Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

to believe that this specialisation of jobs will
continue to increase. However, specialisation
also leads to a compartimentalisation of
personnel in terms of the qualifications required,
to the detriment of flexibility, and at the risk of
a loss of operational added value, given the
inevitably small number of specialist categories.


There is therefore a strong need for
recruitment in the coming years in order to give
the Armed Forces the human resources required
to prepare and execute their increasingly
complex missions. To meet this challenge, it is
now necessary to identify and describe the
profiles to be recruited, trained, mobilised and
retained by reducing the uncertainties inherent
in the career paths offered by the Luxembourg
Armed Forces in order to increase the
attractiveness of the military profession.

The multipolar world we live in means that
today's certainties are not tomorrow's. This
makes it difficult to predict the choices that
people may make in the course of their working
lives. Uncertainty, including the risks incurred in
theatres of operation, is and will remain a
characteristic of a military career. As a
consequence, the Land Force in particular is
facing a shortage of interested profiles on the
Luxembourg labour market and retention will
remain a difficult exercise.


In order to position themselves to meet the
above-mentioned human resources challenges,
the Armed Forces intend to rely on the upcoming
organisation law. The objectives of this legislation
are to:

strengthen the Luxembourg Armed Forces
operationality and responsiveness,

update the organisation of the Armed Forces
and,


The efforts to be made are in all segments of
human resources management simultaneously
and must take into account the evolution of our
society, which tends to emphasise values less
compatible with the military ethos.


modernise and expand military careers.

At officer level, recruitment will be from a
wide range of diplomas. Depending on the
needs of the Luxembourg Armed Forces,
recruitment will be done by direct recruitment
(on a master's or bachelor's degree) or by
indirect recruitment (on a high school diploma
or bachelor's degree, before being sent to a
military school or a specialised civilian institution
to pursue military studies or to obtain a specific
diploma).

With the future introduction of the B1 salary
group (high school graduates) at the non­
commissioned officer’s (NCO) level, the
Luxembourg Armed Forces will undergo major
changes in the composition of military personnel.
This new salary group will be located at the
execution level and will be the backbone of the
Luxembourg Armed Forces, encompassing the
bulk of the future career of NCOs.

In terms of gender equality, the Luxembourg
Armed Forces are continuing their efforts to
increase the rate of females among the military
personnel. This effort will go hand in hand with


-----

the principles of integration, inclusiveness and
integrity, which are aligned with the Women,
Peace and Security (WPS) programme,
established by NATO in the 2000s following the
adoption of UN Security Council Resolution
1325.

Long-term efforts are needed, including
public campaigns, to increase the attractiveness
of military careers and to attract specialist
experts. In this way, the Luxembourg Armed
Forces will be able to meet current and future
challenges, the most important of which is the
recruitment of sufficient numbers of military
and civilian personnel to carry out a growing
range of missions in its traditional field of action,
the land, but also in more recent fields of action,
such as space and cyber.

###### 9.2 Decision-making autonomy


Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

bi-national reconnaissance battalion together
with the Belgian partner, will certainly meet the
principle of solidarity. However, it will also entail
a reduced decision-making autonomy. The
unilateral commitment of sub-units of this
future unit by one partner, regardless of its
duration or the context, will have a more or less
profound impact on the rest of the unit and
therefore necessarily the other partner. This
challenge can also be identified for other
capabilities or domains such as the A400M or
the UAV platoon.


Extensive specialisation in one or other
capability niche can lead to a more or less
pronounced loss of decision-making autonomy,
especially if it does not generate sufficient
critical mass to provide operational added value.

Moreover, high specialisation places the
emphasis primarily on support capabilities,
whereas, to honour the principle of solidarity,
each Ally is required to provide combat
capabilities capable of operating in a highintensity environment.

The Luxembourg Armed Forces' primary
capability objective, the establishment of a


###### 9.3 Multiplying of the defence effort

By continuing the trajectory announced in
2022, the defence effort will have increased
fivefold by the end of the decade compared to
2014. The following challenges which hence will
arise cannot be neglected:


NATO and EU planning deadlines are tighter
than national deadlines; this is particularly
true for infrastructure projects;


the structures must be able to absorb this
defence effort;

the programmes selected must provide
added value to Luxembourg and therefore
ideally be dual-use, an ambition that is
anything but evident;


-----

Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

sufficient budgetary flexibility will be needed
for the acquisition of complex capabilities in
large, long-term, multinational programmes.
Planning in such a context depends not only
on Luxembourg, but also on the progress of
programmes, the evolution of financial
disbursements and other sometimes
unpredictable circumstances that require
budgetary adjustments throughout the life
cycle of a project and a high degree of
responsiveness;


the strive towards a more balanced budget
structure should continue: 25% investment;
50% human resources; 25% implementation
and support;

Luxembourg will also continue to support a
global and more differentiated view of
national defence efforts. This includes taking
into account, instead of GDP, GNI for the
calculation of the defence effort, which is
more representative of the economic reality
of Luxembourg.


###### 9.4 Strategic foresight

A coherent and sustainable defence effort
goes hand in hand with strategic foresight,
ideally extending over several decades. Indeed,
the time needed to build credible military
capabilities requires us to look far ahead.
However, there are objective limits to any
foresight effort. In order to be able to elaborate
concrete and specific recommendations, and
also in due time, it is important to harmonise
our strategic horizon with that of our partners.
This is where regular and focused exchanges
both at bilateral and Benelux level as well as
with the key actors of the Alliance and the EU
– which are first of all the International Staff and
the International Military Staff of the Alliance,
the Allied Command Transformation (ACT), the
Allied Command Operations (ACO), the European
External Action Service (EEAS) and the EU
Military Staff (EUMS) – are of major importance
and will be able to facilitate these largely
complex tasks. Finally, there remains the use of
the expertise of the various competence centers.


-----

The challenges described here, while not
exhaustive, have been identified with our
present analytical capabilities. A major strategic
disruption, unexpected in nature, is nevertheless
possible at any time.

###### 9.5 Access to advanced technologies


In moving forward in the field of advanced
technologies, especially when it comes to
military technologies, even the Allies and EU
Member States tend not to necessarily
emphasise solidarity or pooling and sharing. For
a country like Luxembourg, with few active
players in the defence industrial sector,
technological access presents a real challenge
which must be met first and foremost by
developing, if not strengthening, existing
partnerships. In addition to the cooperation
forums offered by the EDA, the Benelux countries
or the German-led FNC, which offer a broader


Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

cooperation, close bilateral relations are equally
important, especially in order to conclude
security and cooperation agreements in good
time. This access is all the more important to
ensure interoperability and thus the integration
of future weapon systems and defence
capabilities.

Civilian commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)
technology can present many opportunities.
However, from a military point of view, it also
entails risks that should not be underestimated,
as standards often diverge significantly and can
compromise the security of military structures
and their forces on the battlefield. While the use
of military off-the-shelf (MOTS) equipment has
undeniable advantages, especially for a country
like Luxembourg, it also has its limits, as it is not
about preparing for tomorrow's war with
yesterday's technology.

In all fields of application and action, the EDA,
in close cooperation with NATO (NSPA, NCIA,
etc.), is supposed to act as a catalyst for the
benefit of the Member States, especially when
the latter do not themselves have the necessary
tools to keep up with these technological


-----

Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

developments and to move towards sufficiently
rapid implementation.

Access to EDTs and their timely integration
into future military capabilities are of
fundamental importance to safeguard the
technological superiority of the Alliance and the
EU towards potential adversaries and
competitors.

The development of cooperation (cooperative
security) with like-minded partners, particularly
in the Indo-Pacific theatre – including Australia,
South Korea, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore
and Taiwan – and in the immediate neigh­
bourhood, which share broadly similar views in
terms of values and standards, is of fundamental
importance both for this technological access
and for energy and supply security in general.


strategic challenge identified and addressed at
both European and transatlantic levels. Recycling
of materials and waste is one of the levers to
meet these challenges.

The armed forces of the future will be all the
more effective if they manage to maximise their
autonomy in terms of mobility and minimise
their energy and general consumption.

###### 9.7 Development of European defence autonomy and enhanced EU-NATO cooperation


###### 9.6 Energy and supply security

In parallel to the decrease of the energy
consumption of the military apparatus, the
security of energy and supplies (rare earths, raw
materials, semi-conductors, etc.) will further
shape defence plans and consequently future
weapon systems.


In order for industry, both defence and civilian

– the latter being the supplier of many of the
military COTS or dual-use capabilities – to be
able to meet identified and future needs and
thus to honour signed contracts according to
agreed schedules, it is important to secure the
supply chains. This is a particularly important


A major challenge will be to achieve European
strategic autonomy in defence matters while
promoting EU-NATO cooperation. Luxembourg,
like the other members of both organisations,
will always be confronted with the challenge of
the single set of forces and non-duplication. The
signing of the third joint NATO-EU declaration is
welcomed and perceived as a strong signal of
unity in the face of adversaries and competitors,
which will allow a better response to the abovementioned challenge.

Luxembourg's contribution to the
development of this autonomy in the field of EU
defence may seem marginal at first sight, taking
into account the structural limitations of the
Luxembourg Armed Forces in particular.
However, taking into consideration the key
capabilities that the Luxembourg Defence has


-----

succeeded and continues to develop, notably in
the framework of multinational partnerships,
these efforts can today be rightly qualified as
essential.

The development of European defence
autonomy should be seen as an opportunity to
generate complementarity, mutually beneficial
to the EU and the Alliance. A real complementarity
between these two international organisations,
which are crucial for the security of the country
and of the European continent as a whole, will
make it possible to perfect military tools – for
crisis management, deterrence and collective
defence – in order to be able to face the
challenges and competitors of the 21st century.


Luxembourg Defence Guidelines 2035

generated and preserved by NATO that has
created the preconditions for the exceptional
economic development of this EU and hence of
the Grand Duchy. Taking into account the current
and future security environment, a strong
European pillar within NATO – which remains
the cornerstone of collective defence – marked
by a growing role for the EU, will be essential to
face the new challenges – hybrid, cyber or other
threats – amplified and organised by rapidly
developing EDT.


The reciprocal advantages of the transatlantic
partnership, in the face of strategic competitors,
are considered undeniable and irrevocable. Let
us recall here that it is indeed the peace


The EU, which already has an impressive
range of instruments at its disposal and is
meanwhile deploying a growing defence effort,
will have to meet these challenges by relying on
collective resilience. Luxembourg will by
developing an appropriate integrated approach
with the support of its reference partners and
other like-minded countries.
