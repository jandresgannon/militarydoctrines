prepare our forces for challenges over the next five-year period. The GAF must continue to
invest in developing its ability to fight alone, while at the same time supporting the


-----

progression from self-defense to collective defense. Where possible, every effort will be
made to put resources towards achieving both goals together.

**I - Introduction**

Georgian National Military Strategy constitutes the main part of the National Security
Concept and significantly shapes implementation of the national defence policy through
2010. It defines fields of activities of the Georgian Armed Forces (GAF) and plans within the
short-term (2005-2007) and mid-term (2008-2010) perspective. The National Military
Strategy forms the basis for future development of an effective security system and building
the GAF. Moreover it underlines the steps for enhancing defense capabilities necessary for
Georgia’s integration into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).

This is the first National Military Strategy produced by Georgia. As the first document of its
type, it is intended to provide a broad overview of the strategic direction of the GAF. It is
written in general terms so as to be available to promote public awareness and
understanding of the military. After the Strategic Defense Review is completed, revisions to
this document will be made, to include the issuance of detailed classified annexes providing
operational planning guidance and implementing instructions for force structure.

**Major missions and functions of the Georgian Armed Forces**

Missions and functions of the GAF are defined by the Law on Defense (III Paragraph, article
#7) and include such objectives as protection of independence, protection of territorial
integrity and fulfilment of international agreements. The GAF performs these functions
under the direction and authority of the Ministry of Defense, according to the principles of
democratic civilian control. In order to fulfil the national interests of Georgia, the Ministry of
Defense (MOD) has the following missions:

- To give political direction to manage the GAF development process;

- To maintain forces in a high state of readiness;

- To carry out political decisions made by the executive and legislative branches of the
Georgian government;

- To identify threats based on the current military-political situation;

- To develop the force structure of the GAF;

- To accomplish military cooperation in accordance with international treaties and
agreements.

**Main development directions of the GAF**

The first priority of our defense policy is to improve GAF combat capabilities. This process
requires qualified training of personnel, modernization of old and obsolete equipment,
enhancing intelligence, equipping and supplying the force, and improving the quality of life
and working conditions for military personnel.

The second objective is to facilitate the NATO-integration process, which will provide
deterrence and security to Georgia through the mechanisms of collective defense. The
ultimate goal is a highly capable, NATO-interoperable Armed Force able to contribute to any
NATO-led military operations.

The third defense policy objective is to improve the defense management system, primarily
focusing on improving the planning and budgeting process as well as development
programs. This will promote the effective use of human, material and financial resources
and become the basis for the future GAF development.

**II - General Principles of Defense of Georgia**


-----

Georgian National Military Strategy as a integral part of national defense policy identifies the
foundation for developing ways for building the Armed Forces and to develop its structure
and capabilities. Armed Forces developed in accordance with this strategy have a direct
influence on the state security and serve to deter aggression. The defense policy supports
the National Security Concept of Georgia both in dealing with ongoing situations and in
developing the strategy to be applied during possible future crisis situations.

It identifies circumstances for using force inside or outside the country. Defense policy
includes long-term and short-term strategic planning for effectively allocating resources and
identifying specific capabilities required to safeguard our national interests. There are five
general principles of the Georgian defense policy:

**General principles of defense of Georgia**

**1. Prevention of and Protection from direct aggression**

**2. NATO integration and international cooperation**

**3. Ability to asses strategic environment precisely**

**4. Provide stability in the Caucasus region**

**5. Contribution to the international security environment**

**Prevention of and protection from direct aggression**

Military preparedness and capability of Georgia, along with that of our partners, are
necessary to deter aggression. Deterrence is the preferred means of protection for Georgia.
Well-prepared Armed Forces and the will of society to resist potential adversaries constitute
the bulk of deterrence. This posture provides stability for the state, thus granting better
opportunities for peaceful accomplishment of the national interests of Georgia. Should a
military threat occur, it would be necessary to take steps to provide security and defense of
Georgia, and to resolve conflict on favourable terms. This requires coordinated action by
Georgian state agencies in making optimal use of available resources.

**NATO integration and international cooperation**

The nature of current threats and challenges, and the difficulty of anticipating them in
advance, requires Georgia to seek close security cooperation within the international
community. Furthermore, Georgia faces a complex regional environment in the Caucasus
with limited resources, which impels us to seek additional security in the form of alliances
and partnerships. A cornerstone of the defense policy of Georgia is to shift from the
territorial principle of defense to the collective principle. To accomplish this, we are actively
involved in the activities of partner nations’ coalition forces and seek NATO membership
within the short-term. Georgian defense policy is focused on the dynamic development of
military capabilities as part of the NATO integration process.

**Ability to assess strategic environment precisely**

An ability to make timely assessments and accurate conclusions is essential to the
effectiveness of national defense. Georgia must be aware of the international environment,
as well as the situation in the Caucasus. National efforts are focused on maintaining the
required intelligence capability at the tactical, operational and strategic level, to allocate
defense resources more effectively, and to include meeting the technical challenges.

**Provide stability in the Caucasus region**


-----

A primary element of Georgian defense policy is maintaining stability and close political
cooperation with our neighbour countries. We recognize the legitimate interests of other
states and seek to maintain relationships that support security and prosperity, as well as
promote respect for internationally recognized borders.

**Contribution to the international security environment**
Georgia understands that its long-term future as a free, secure and prosperous nation
depends largely on an international order that is free of coercion, aggression and terrorism.
Georgia recognizes its responsibilities as a member of the international community to work
towards that goal.

**III - Role of National Military Strategy**

Georgian National Military Strategy provides guidance to all Ministry of Defense (MOD) and
GAF personnel and to other ministries when they are in a role directly supporting the MOD.

The National Military Strategy identifies goals and objectives, requirements and capabilities
based on the security and defense policy analysis. It supports the efforts of accomplishing
the national interests of Georgia to provide modern affordable and sustainable defense
capabilities. It identifies when military force can be used and what political purpose such
decisions serve.

**National Military Strategy Document**

**1. Supports National Security Strategy**

**2. Identifies military goals, objectives and requirements**

**3. Defines activities and provides operational planning guidance to GAF**

**4. Provides guidance for GAF structure and capabilities through 2010**

National Security Strategy and defense policy together form a broad context for using
armed forces, under democratic, civilian control and in coordination with other instruments
of state authority. This document defines the fields of activities of the Georgian Armed
Forces and provides guidance for operational planning in the short-term and mid-term
perspective. The National Military Strategy forms the basis for the future development of
the entire GAF, including their structure and capabilities through 2010. The document
provides guidance to support Georgia’s participation in coalition military operations, and to
develop the GAF’s interoperability with NATO forces.

**IV - Key Aspects of Strategic Environment**

Georgia’s current strategic environment includes a rapidly changing political landscape,
rapid technological changes, a diversity of potential adversaries and limited military
capabilities. The analysis of existing and potential threats and challenges helps to identify
missions and tasks assigned to the GAF. The Georgian Threat Assessment document
provides a detailed analysis of these specific threats, to include their probability and impact.
The mission, structure and requirements of the GAF are derived from this Threat
Assessment.

**Threats**

The Caucasus, especially the North Caucasus region, is highly dangerous and unstable.
There are frozen conflicts and the danger of new crises occurring. While the probability of
direct aggression against Georgia in the near future is low, there are other real challenges
threatening the security and welfare of the country.


-----

One of the biggest threats for Georgia stems from the separatist activities within its
borders. The temporary lack of Georgian jurisdiction and control in separatist territories
negatively affects not only the state security, but also the development prospects of the
country.

Russian military bases and Peacekeeping Troops within our territory have a history of
provoking instability in the separatist regions and remain a threat. Until their complete
withdrawal, this issue will require continuous attention. There will always be forces in the
Russian Federation that will provide active support to separatist regimes using Russian
bases within Georgia.

Georgia’s involvement in major international economic projects presents particular security
challenges. We assess that threats to industrial and critical infrastructure from subversive
and terrorist acts will likely increase. Protecting of this infrastructure, some of which is
located close to ethnic conflict areas and hence remains vulnerable to sabotage, is a
Georgian security policy priority.

Moreover, Georgia falls within the neighbourhood of the Middle East – one of the most
dangerous and unstable regions, with its history of state sponsored terrorism and the
development of weapons of mass destruction and missile systems. Active participation of
the GAF in international and antiterrorist operations makes Georgia a target for terrorists.
Therefore, issues associated with the process of democratization in the Middle East and the
potential implications on Georgia must be closely watched.

**Limited capabilities**

Current security requirements set forth multiple tasks for the Armed Forces of Georgia and
require appropriate resource support to conduct military operations. The effectiveness of the
Armed Forces is determined by the following three main factors: training level, modern
technical equipment and effective management system. Attaining high levels in all three
areas will be impossible without the allocation of sufficient financial and material resources.
At present, the GAF has significant shortfalls in all three areas. This would make it
impossible for the GAF to neutralize all existing or potential threats if required.

Another factor is also of great importance – Georgia is surrounded by relatively strong and
more capable neighbours. Furthermore, Georgia is facing multiple kinds of potential
adversaries, who have the capability to conduct non-standard combat operations as well.
We recognize that it will be impossible to respond to all existing or potential threats. Until
our country attains NATO membership, thus acquiring much firmer guarantees than it
currently has, it will be necessary to rely solely on our own forces and their ability to
conduct different types of operations.

**V - National Military Objectives**

National Military Strategy is defensive in nature. National Military Objectives of Georgia
stem from the security and defense policy priorities of the country. These military objectives
define the role of the GAF in providing for (of) the security of our Nation and supporting
conditions for economic prosperity, political freedom and stability. They also provide
guidelines for the planning and conduct of military operations.

**National Military Objectives:**
**1. Defense**
**2. Deterrence and Prevention**
**3. Readiness**
**4. International military cooperation**

**Defense**


-----

The primary military objective is the protection of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Georgia. The sovereignty of Georgia must be protected across the full spectrum (land,
airspace, maritime). The territorial integrity of Georgia must be maintained consistent with
international law and along internationally recognized borders. The state defense is ensured
regardless of the size or power of our adversaries by conducting military operations inside
the country as well as by conducting different kinds of missions outside Georgia. In order to
accomplish this priority objective, it is essential to maintain close relations with NATO and
partner nations. External assistance gained from these relationships ensures deterrence and
the ability to resist against a militarily stronger enemy. Timely discovery of the sources of
threat, accurate analysis of the intelligence reports and the high quality of interagency
coordination are of great importance. The GAF must prevail against adversaries during
conflict to ensure post-conflict resolution on favorable terms.

Georgia will apply the principle of maximum resistance in the event of aggression. In the
face of a military threat, all the resources of the Georgian State will be mobilized to
reinforce our defense capability. Due to the small size of Georgia’s territory, the limited
operational space, and dispersed location of strategic areas (cities, industrial centres,
stations, lines and communications), retreat cannot occur. The limited resources of the GAF
would make recovery of lost territory very difficult against a military stronger adversary.

Faced with a militarily superior adversary, the armed forces, as well as other state agencies
and the general population, will use all means to offer resistance and act in close
coordination to create unpredictable space for the enemy. This principle does not mean the
active involvement of the population in combatant actions as active fighters. This is the role
of the GAF. Civilians’ function is to implement obligations defined by the constitution and
support armed forces with material, information and personnel. Coordinated actions of the
armed forces, other agencies and the population enable our country to cause uncertainty
and considerable damage to the enemy. Close coordination among the armed forces,
government bodies and population creates intolerable conditions for the adversary,
depriving them freedom of activity. Creation of unpredictable space is determined by
patriotism and the high defense will of the citizens of Georgia. The important factor is the
ability to accomplish effective resistance through autonomy and decentralization at the
tactical level. Separate units must be able to achieve tactical advantage through
independent actions conducted according an existing command plan that supports defined
national objectives.

The main priority in implementing combat operations and ensuring further success is the
maintenance of combat capability. Armed Forces will avoid decisive engagement with a
militarily superior force because of the potential for the total destruction of the GAF and
their combat capabilities. When necessary, the GAF will resort to asymmetrical warfare,
guerrilla tactics and mobile units to maintain combat capabilities and cause profound
damage to the adversary. Due to the small size of the GAF, maintaining adequately trained
forces is one of the main components of both our deterrence and combat capabilities. In any
circumstances the Georgian soldier and his unit must have advantages for survival in
comparison with adversary and consequently he must be trained and equipped properly.

**Deterrence and Prevention**

Top priority is given to achieving maximum deterrence, to prevent an attack on the country.
In an unstable environment, with potential adversaries acting with little indications and
warning against Georgia, deterrence becomes a major objective of defense. Deterrence is
not only a military effort, but includes political and diplomatic aspects as well. The military
element of deterrence is achieved through a high level of combat training and readiness
within the GAF as well as the political will of society to resist potential invaders. A potential
adversary is deterred by reducing his possibility of quick success and increasing his
probability of incurring significant losses from military actions.

The deterrence of the adversary is directly related to maintaining sufficient combat
capabilities to prevent the GAF from being forced into making a strategic retreat. Therefore,
an important aspect of deterrence is ensuring the survivability of the GAF. Our forces will


-----

take full advantage of operational tactics and natural conditions of the combat area to
ensure survival, deny the adversary success, and make the conduct of military operations
against Georgia very costly. Only in this case it will be possible to deter the adversary and
compensate for the small size of our armed forces.

Georgia may not be able to deter adversaries and prevent some actions independently.
Therefore Georgia must maintain close and coordinated cooperation with NATO and partner
countries. Georgia’s ability to maintain a successful deterrence - and prevention posture in
the long term is tied directly to its participation in cooperative defense and alliances. The
significance of international military cooperation will be increased.

**Readiness**

This principle primarily refers to the high readiness of the GAF to perform combat and other
types of operations. The period of time necessary to react to the enemy activities may be
very short, especially given the threat inside Georgia’s borders. Quick, adequate and
effective response by well-trained units will be the major factor for the success of the GAF.
The high readiness cannot be attained without detailed operational plans, which are
developed and understood in advance, as well as effectively organized coordination between
different state agencies. The GAF must maintain a standardized readiness system, with the
flexibility to move units from one level of readiness to another, as the threat situation
requires.

**International military cooperation**

The military plays an important role in supporting national political and diplomatic
objectives. It is essential for the GAF to maintain close relations with the military forces of
NATO and partner nations, upon whom Georgia may have to rely for support and assistance
if threatened by a militarily stronger adversary. If Georgia is unable to deter the source of
threat independently, it must rely on close and coordinated cooperation with its partner
countries. Units participating in peace and stability operations outside the country must take
full advantage of these missions as they present an opportunity to develop long term
military to military relationships, as well as to enhance the professional reputation of the
GAF. The experience gained from operations abroad will help to raise combat capability of
GAF and increase the interoperability of Georgian units with NATO.

**VI - Military Capabilities Required**

Georgia does not anticipate the threat of large-scale warfare in the near future, and places
the emphasis on preparing for middle and low intensity warfare. However, until Georgia
attains NATO membership, it is necessary to organize and prepare independently the
defence resources of the country for organized resistance in case of aggression. This section
describes the military capabilities the GAF must maintain in order to be able to meet the
National Military Objectives.

**Flexibility**

The first key principle is flexibility of military units. The need for the flexibility of the Armed
Forces is primarily due to the instability of the strategic environment and the diversity of
expected threats. Military units of Georgia must be capable of rapid action and changing
from one type of operation to another. Flexibility includes capability of rapid deployment
and adequate actions related to neutralize an adversary.

**Military Capabilities Required**

**1. Flexibility**
**2. Conduct joint operations**
**3. Interoperability with NATO**
**4. Conduct deliberate and crisis action planning**


-----

**5. Military support to civil authorities**
**6. Information and intelligence capability**

The GAF must be ready to react to unexpected changes, which forms the prerequisite for
maintaining initiative and achieving success. This fact requires a priority effort to develop
specialized units that can respond effectively to non standard-threats and conduct special
operations near to the source of the threat, whether inside or outside of the country.
Therefore, establishment of effective Special Forces will be an important priority within
Georgian defence policy.

The requirement for flexibility increases the responsibility of the battalion commander and
other military unit commanders. Commanders must show initiative, a high intellectual level,
and the ability to make independent tactical decisions. Our small-sized forces must have
leaders with high levels of professionalism and expertise, who have the ability to lead their
units in decentralized operations.

**Conduct joint operations**

Coordinated actions among military services acting within a joint network are essential for
success. Based on the geography and the threats to Georgia Land Forces form most of the
GAF. Planning and implementation of combat operations in the defense of Georgia are
mainly focused on land operations. Air and naval forces play crucial roles in maintaining of
Georgia’s sovereignty and effective deterrence across the entire spectrum of potential
conflict. During the defense of Georgia, we expect the Air Force and Navy would most likely
support military operations conducted by the Land Forces units. Georgian ground forces
have to be protected with air defense systems and must be able to rely on secure ports and
coastal areas. In the future, the GAF must also be able to conduct joint operations planning
and to conduct operations under a warfighting Joint Forces Headquarter. We must be able
to conduct joint force operations that effectively combine the strengths of individual
services. This requires extensive joint planning to achieve highly developed interoperability
and procedures, which make joint operations successful. Furthermore, the ability of the GAF
to conduct joint operations is essential to achieving interoperability with NATO and
especially with U.S. forces.

**Interoperability with NATO / Participation in International Operations**

The GAF must maintain the capability to participate in international military operations and
exercises in a professional and successful manner and to achieve professional
interoperability with NATO Forces. Such operations place the GAF in a highly visible position
before the international community, performing missions with important political
consequences. The GAF will therefore make a priority effort in the training and preparation
of units deploying for such missions. The GAF must develop procedures and capability for
efficient deployment, sustainment, and redeployment.

English language skills must be developed, particularly among the leadership, to enable
effective direct communication during operations and exercises with NATO and partner
nations. At the same time as individual units are being prepared for coalition operations, the
GAF must strive to develop interoperability in its organization, equipment and procedures,
especially with respect to NATO.

**Conduct deliberate and crisis action planning**

The GAF must have an effective deliberate planning system to develop specific operational
plans for anticipated crisis scenarios. The Threat Assessment Document drives the
deliberate planning process by identifying the most likely and most dangerous threats


-----

against the country. The concepts of joint actions elaborated at the General Staff and
planned at the strategic and operational level support the implementation of national
military objectives. These concepts include operational plans of security, stability,
intimidation and main combat directions of the country. The plans take into consideration
the likelihood that Georgia will face an increase in unconventional threats in future,
including the possibility of unstable conditions and unexpected attacks. These plans also
provide links among the military goals and ensure their consideration at the operational and
tactical level, and implementation during the combat operations.
The GAF must have the capability to conduct quality, professional operational planning. The
following considerations are important:

- involvement of other government agencies in the joint plan will be especially significant

- consistency with western standards of deliberate planning

- rapid transition to crisis action planning at the General Staff and Joint Force Headquarters
levels

- planning for civil support missions, to include identifying and integrating capabilities within
the GAF, that have been developed for war fighting, and which can assist civil authorities
during emergencies.

**Military support to civil authorities**

There must be procedures in place for the GAF to provide support to civil authorities in the
event of significant natural or man-made disasters. In the event of major disasters with
large numbers of casualties and damage to infrastructure and the environment, the civil
authorities will not have sufficient resources to meet all of their requirements. The GAF
must be ready to provide manpower and logistics support in a timely manner to save lives
and prevent further injury and damage. Procedures for employment of military forces in
support to civil authorities, to include appropriate roles and clear command and control
arrangements, must be established in implementing directives.

Georgian National Guard (GNG) is normally the principle organization responsible for
providing military assistance to the civilian government during emergencies. Working in
close cooperation with local governmental bodies, the GNG takes actions intended for saving
lives and providing for the health of the population and environment, such as supporting
with field-medical service. However, all available resources of the GAF must be available for
potential emergency support operations, consistent with current security and defense
requirements. The GAF must be ready to shift from the conduct of combat operations to
neutralizing secondary effects which may occur (i.e. ecological and humanitarian disasters
in case of oil pipe explosion or incidents involving weapons of mass destruction).

For the unity of the nation, it is important for all the citizens of Georgia to know the GAF are
ready to provide them with timely and effective emergency support.

**Information and intelligence capability**

Georgia has important requirements for information flow and intelligence capability. We
have limited capabilities to respond to all potential threats, and thus must depend on
accurate and timely intelligence to ensure our security. Timely and effective military
response will depend on the ability to conduct accurate intelligence analysis to support the
decision making process. Additionally, early identification of aggression will enable Georgia
to make timely notification to the international community, and to seek appropriate
assistance by diplomatic or other means.

Globalisation and rapid technological development have occurred within the past few years.
Potential adversaries, be they states, non-state actors or international terrorists, will try to
use these new technologies for their own purposes. There is a high likelihood of our
adversaries using conventional and weapons of mass destruction. They could also utilize
weapons made of components having civilian as well as military utility, and which are
therefore easy to obtain. There is also the threat of a third party providing such weapons to
our probable adversary. This, and other circumstances, brings new problems and challenges
regarding the flow of information on arms proliferation and new weapons technologies.


-----

Coordination of inter-agency relations and intensification of international cooperation are
especially important. Exchange of information with NATO and partner countries as well as at
all the levels in the national chain of command is one of the essential factors to success and
will enable our country to adequately react to threats across the spectrum impelled by the
rapid technological development.

Georgia faces some serious threats, particularly internal threats, which may occur with little
or no indications and warning. The Threat Assessment document provides further details. To
protect against surprise attack, the strengthening of intelligence on every level is
significantly important. This includes both modern sensors as well as human intelligence
sources. As Georgia works towards greater NATO interoperability, it will be necessary to
maintain the capability to utilize modern intelligence systems and their products. With NATO
integration, however, comes more reliance on technology and vulnerability to technology
issues.

**VII - Structure of the Armed Forces**

The GAF must be structured to accomplish the national military objectives. Georgian military
units may be limited in the time available to react to an attack. The structural organization
of Armed Forces units must guarantee mobility and effective actions, capability of optimal
deployment, rearrangement and engagement in warfare. The force planning process must
be consistent with the three-year threat assessment and the real capabilities of the country.
Decisions regarding service structure and capabilities must provide the means to ensure
success in combat and other kinds of operations. The structure of the GAF must support the
successful conduct of different kinds of military operations simultaneously, to include
transition from war fighting to providing emergency support to civilians. Commanders must
be able to exercise non-stereotype judgment in their decision-making process. The GAF
must be able to fight with unit autonomy and decentralization of command.

**Active and reserve forces**

A modern and trained reserve is one of the major components of the GAF. Due to its
complex geopolitical disposition, Georgia needs reserve forces to deter external aggression
and to protect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country in case armed conflict
occurs. Also, reserve forces are necessary to conduct relief operations in case of natural
disasters. Georgia will not be able to respond to threats and challenges by using only active
forces, as it cannot maintain sufficiently large active forces. Decisions regarding the right
mix of active and reserve force structure must be made consistent with national military
objectives, the threat assessment, and the resources available. MoD priorities include
developing a more effective mobilization system and improving the current reserve training.

The GAF consists of Land Forces, Air Forces, Naval Forces, and National Guard.

- Due to geography and the preponderance of the threat, Land Forces constitute the bulk of
the GAF. The Land Forces must be able to maintain the integrity of Georgia’s external
borders, and to deal with potential threats. The land defense of Georgia is provided by
infantry brigades, artillery and Special Forces Brigade, and other supporting capability
organized at the battalion level. The Land Forces currently provide units for out of country
coalition support operations.

- The Air Force provides air support to the GAF and must be able to maintain the integrity
and security of Georgia’s airspace. This includes defense against the modern ballistic missile
threat, as well as against intrusion by manned aircraft. One of the highest priorities of
Georgia is to develop a NATO interoperable Air Defense System, and have the
infrastructure, and communications upgraded in order to attain major air sovereignty
capabilities. The GAD will develop a surveillance system, including establishment of an
effective radar and air surveillance integrated command and control center, and a
modernized ground-based missile air defense system.


-----

- The Georgian Navy is responsible for protecting the sovereignty of Georgia within the
Georgian territorial waters. It must have sufficient capability to secure the sea lines of
communications and to protect Georgian waters, ports and coastline from attack and from
other violation or intrusion. The Navy is also a force for promoting international relations by
participating in combined operations and exercises with naval forces of partner nations, in
support of Georgia’s collective maritime defense interests. The Georgian Navy priorities are
to modernize its fleet, optimize its structure and force management system, and fully man
and train its sea operations main headquarters.

- The Georgian National Guard has the responsibility to organize and conduct combat
training for the Army Reserve. The GNG must for plan and execute the mobilization of
reservists, to include establishing procedures for call up and establishing collection points. It
is involved in the “Host Nation Support” program to support operations by NATO-countries
and fulfills such functions as patrolling or securing HNS-infrastructure. The GNG is also the
primary force for providing military assistance to civilian authorities in the event of
emergencies.

- The Military Police Service (MPS) is an essential structural unit to provid legal order and
control within the GAF. This new unit must be well manned, equipped and trained to
accomplish missions both in and out of country, including peacekeeping and antiterrorist
operations.

**Training**

Training at the individual and unit levels must be conducted in accordance with tasks,
conditions and standards, all supporting the GAF’s ability to accomplish the national military
objectives. To be relevant, combat training of the GAF personnel must develop their ability
to participate in all kinds of combat operations. To be successful, individuals must possess a
high level of the theoretical knowledge and practical skills. Units of the GAF must be
manned with qualified persons who have common sense and clearly understand their
responsibilities. The GAF must further invest in the development and professional military
education of its leaders and career personnel. This investment is essential to ensure military
leaders and career personnel understand the tactics and technical issues of modern warfare,
are proficient in their specialties, and can represent the GAF in combined military activities.

Unit training must be realistic and demanding, given the time and resources available. Units
that are tasked with maintaining specialized capabilities or with being able to conduct
autonomous operations must receive appropriate training. The Ministry of Defense and
General Staff will also direct joint training to occur between the services, also with civil
authorities to prepare for possible emergency support operations.

**VIII - Vision for the Future of the Georgian Armed Forces**

National Military Strategy provides the foundation for a clear structural scheme for Georgia’s
National Defense and identifies priorities for military planning and development. It provides
the main principles of military strategy that will prepare our forces for challenges over the
next five-year period. The national military goals as well as assessment of current and
foreseeable threats enable us to determine capabilities necessary for our Armed Forces to
achieve combat goals in the most effective way.

We conclude the National Military Strategy document with our vision for the future. The GAF
will support this effort through interoperability with NATO military forces. Until such time as
Georgia joins a mutual defense alliance such as NATO, the GAF must be prepared to
successfully defend the state with its own resources. The GAF must therefore continue to
invest in developing its ability to defend alone, while at the same time supporting the
progression from self-defense to collective defense. Where possible, every effort will be
made to put resources towards achieving both goals together.


-----

Therefore, it is important to focus on the principle of interoperability in developing force
structure, and in updating communications equipment and weapons systems. This will be
impossible without efforts towards improving Command and Control, Combat Support,
Combat Service Support, and logistics in general. Moreover, important efforts will be made
towards improving Host Nation Support capabilities. Maintenance of cooperation, close
information exchange with NATO partners and material assistance will be the precondition
of effective resistance.

The GAF will continue to enhance individual service capabilities. This will include taking a
balanced approach to ensure adequate resources are committed to maintaining land,
airspace and maritime sovereignty. We must develop the GAF’s ability to conduct joint
operations. This includes the ability of our services to operate jointly under a Joint Forces
Headquarters. Developing this joint capability will make the GAF more effective and
interoperable with the military forces of NATO and partner nations. During the next five
years, GAF will conduct operations not only on the territory of Georgia but also outside the
country, as part of international coalitions contributing to stability and antiterrorist missions.
Priority efforts will be made to reach the highest level of interoperability with our partner
nation forces, without structural and technical complications. The GAF will also structure and
equip forces for deployment out of country. We will develop efficient deployment
procedures, and the ability to sustain and support deployed forces.

Whether the GAF will be operating inside Georgia or out of country, we anticipate they will
face the challenges associated with modern unconventional warfare. GAF must be ready for
asymmetrical warfare, where there will be no frontlines in battles. Consequently, the GAF
will enhance its capability to conduct special operations inside and outside of country, which
means elimination of threat near to its source. The infantry battalion remains the principal
tactical unit of the GAF, and will be prepared to fight with unconventional methods when
necessary. However, Special Forces units are the most suitable for responding to nonstandard threats. The strengthening of intelligence on every level will become significantly
important. It will be very important to understand the workings of and the impact of
technology and advanced weapons systems. Georgia must be realistic with respect to the
resources it will have available to purchase expensive high technology systems. Instead, we
will work to enhance cooperation in intelligence and exchange of information with NATO
Alliance and partner countries.

Georgia will invest in the training and development of its military personnel, particularly in
its leadership. The nature of modern conflict requires the manning of units with qualified
persons who clearly understand their responsibilities. The main requirements for success
during future combat operations will be initiatives at different levels, strengthening
intelligence and high level of the flow of information, comprehensive training, interagency
integration and flexibility. The GAF must have effective units, led by professional and highly
educated personnel, who are able to act in a different operational environment and conduct
combined operations with forces of NATO and partner nations. Putting these components
into practice will form the basis for future success of the Georgian Armed Forces.
