## FOREWORD 

**_“How can man die better, than facing fearful odds,_**

**_for the ashes of his fathers and the temples of his Gods.”_**

Like all other modern armed forces, the Indian Army has
been considerably influenced by the Revolution in Military
Affairs and the great strides being made in technology
development. This has necessitated a transformation in
strategic thinking along with a paradigm shift in organization
and conduct of operations. As a consequence, military
doctrines, weapon systems and force structures need to
undergo a review. Our vision for the twenty-first century is to
have a well equipped and optimally structured army, enabling
it to respond effectively to varied situations and demands
whilst it continually adapts itself to meet future challenges.

Such a vision places emphasis on the ability to augment
existing strengths, develop new skills, think imaginatively and
attempt innovative approaches to cope with the emerging
environment. The challenges that we will be confronted with
require us to visualize what our Army of the future should look
like and accordingly develop suitable approaches to structures,
equipping and training to emerge with flying colours in future
conflict situations. The impetus for change must come from
within and flow through the entire Army.


-----

The Indian Army has to maintain a high level of readiness
for war in varied terrain conditions and should have the
capability to operate in the complete spectrum of conflict. The
Indian Army Doctrine (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Doctrine’)
outlines a framework for a better understanding of the
approach to warfare and provides the foundation for its
practical application.

Funds scarcity or shortfall is a challenge faced by all
armies of the world and hence there is a need for improved
operating cultures and optimization of resources. The winning
armies of the future will not necessarily be the ones that have
greater combat power but ones that can visualize and
comprehend battles more clearly. There will invariably be
technological gaps between the systems that we possess and
those developed up to that point in time. Notwithstanding this
gap we have to continuously utilize all available resources
imaginatively and effectively.

The emergence of Information Warfare as a major force
multiplier points clearly towards the imperatives of networkcentric warfare. Additionally, present trends indicate a marked
shift towards the manoeuvre style of warfare and directive
style of command. Concurrently, the requirement for joint
operations and the need for greater integration and interdependence amongst the three Services are viewed as being
essential for success.

This Doctrine emphasizes that the profession of arms is a
calling. The hallmark of a good soldier entails having a sense
of responsibility, professional expertise and loyalty to the
Nation and the Army. The ethos and moral code set forth
principles and ideals; these exhort every man in uniform to
abide by his duty without regard to personal safety. This ethos
forms the bedrock of the Army’s preparedness in peace and is
the key to its effectiveness in war.

Indian Army officers would do well to develop a broadbased, all-inclusive understanding of warfare and not become


-----

overly reliant on rigid adherence to prescriptive rules. The
nature of this Doctrine is enduring and yet dynamic; it drives
development of both, the art and science of war. In the Army it
provides the focus for constructive debate within well-informed
and professional circles and acts as a guide to the younger
generation. Training in the Army should focus on management
of change and operational adaptation to change. Towards this
end, providing the kind of ambience that encourages and
facilitates intellectual development should be an unceasing
endeavour.

 THE INDIAN ARMY

## SECTION 1 : DOCTRINE, CONCEPT AND
 STRATEGY


**_“Doctrine is indispensable to an army. Doctrine_**

**_provides a military organisation with a common_**
**_philosophy, a common language, a common purpose,_**
**_and a unity of effort”._**

**– General George H. Decker, 1960.**


**Doctrine**

1.1 Military doctrines have provided the basic approach to
all important aspects related to war for armies of most nations
over the past few centuries. Prevailing strategic realities,
threats, challenges, visualised opportunities and national
aspirations are the major factors which have a strong influence
on the formulation of military doctrines. A doctrine is generally
a written document; it could also be a widely accepted
understanding without being specifically enunciated. In the
Indian context the need for formulating and enunciating a
comprehensive military doctrine has gained momentum with
advancements in military technologies and the changing
nature of war in our times. Military doctrine is neither dogma
nor does it replace or take away the authority and obligation of
the commander on the spot to determine a proper course of
action under the circumstances prevailing at the time of
decision.

1.2 In simple words, military doctrine is a particular policy
taught or advocated; a set of principles by which military forces
guide their actions in support of national objectives. Military
doctrine can be defined as ‘a formal expression of military
knowledge and thought that an army accepts as being relevant
at a given time, which covers the nature of current and future
conflicts, the preparation of the army for such conflicts and the
methods of engaging in them to achieve success’. It is
authoritative but requires judgement in application. The
illustration below depicts the inputs that traditionally contribute
to the formulation of a military doctrine and outputs that flow
from its enunciation.


-----

**Concept**

1.3 A concept is defined as **‘a general notion or statement**
of an idea, expressing how something might be done or
accomplished, that may lead to an accepted procedure’. In the
nascent stage a concept may be nebulous; however, it
crystallises as it develops. In the Indian military context a
concept is generally enunciated at the strategic and
operational levels. It articulates, in very broad terms, a
visualisation of the manner in which operations are to be
conducted, and focuses on the principal elements which will
drive them.

**Strategy**

1.4 Strategy is the art and science of developing and using
elements of national power including political, economic,
psychological, technological capabilities and military forces, as
necessary, during peace and war to achieve national
objectives. Military strategy is derived from the overall national
or ‘grand’ strategy.

**_“Winning Strategists are certain of triumph_**
**_Before seeking a challenge._**
**_Loosing Strategists are certain to challenge_**
**_Before seeking a triumph”._**

**– Sun Tzu, The Art of War.**


-----

## SECTION 2 : ENVIRONMENT AND THREAT


**_“There can be four dangers to a state;_**
**_That which is of external origin and of internal abetment;_**
**_That which is of internal origin and of external abetment;_**
**_That which is of external origin and of external abetment;_**
**_and that which is of internal origin and of internal abetment”._**

**_– Kautilya._**


**General**

1.5 India is a country of continental size with land borders
shared with a large number of countries, 1197 islands and a
coastline of 7516 kilometres with a vast Exclusive Economic
Zone. Despite her historically developed racial, cultural,
linguistic and religious diversity, India is a nation with an
innately all-embracing, secular polity that has welcomed and
assimilated various cultures into her existing milieu. Her
modern values are rooted in democratic governance and
profound respect for human life. We remain peaceful without
being pacifists and have a vision for the future with a measure
of confidence in ourselves as we strive for economic progress
and integration in the global environment. Defending India
calls for defending her physical, economic and cultural identity
in the prevalent geo-political milieu.

**The Geo-political Environment**

1.6 The geo-political scenario is fast changing and is likely
to continue to do so in the coming decades. Although the USA
remains the only super power today, the world is witnessing
the emergence of various centres of power, with India
emerging as one of the leading global players. Each centre of
power is attempting to achieve a ‘balance of interest’ as
opposed to the erstwhile ‘balance of power’. Greater reliance
is being placed on democracy as a factor contributing to
conflict prevention and increasing emphasis on bilateral or
multi-lateral groupings as a means to deter aggression against
weak nations. There is also a growing concern about the


-----

proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the spread of
terrorism. Energy security and control of scarce resources are
assuming trans-national proportions.

1.7 As part of the Southern Asian Region, India has
considerable interests in the areas stretching from West Asia
through Central Asia and South Asia to South East Asia. The
Indian Ocean region is of great importance to India and it
assumes strategic significance due to the high volume of
Indian and international trade transiting through the Indian
Ocean. Existing and emerging regional groupings give rise to
competitiveness with the attendant possibility of increasing
instability due to inter and intra-regional conflicts. The region
also includes a number of nuclear weapon or nuclear-capable
states. In addition, this region is witnessing an unprecedented
proliferation in small arms and narcotics trafficking which, in
turn, threaten the stability of states and societies. Trans-border
migration on economic grounds also raises serious security
concerns.

1.8 India is a member of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC), the Association for South
East Asian Nations Regional Forum (ARF) and the Indian
Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation (IOR-ARC).
By virtue of her size and strategic location in the Indian Ocean
region, India is expected to play her rightful role to ensure
peace and stability in it.

**The Economic Environment**

1.9 With market forces playing an important role, economic
strength is likely to become the currency of power. National
economies are undergoing liberalisation to cater to
globalisation. The dominance of the developed world over the
global economy is, nonetheless, likely to continue. Even so,
China and India have been acknowledged as emerging
economic powers. Economic linkages and inter-dependence
amongst countries are likely to result in mutual security
becoming an important issue. Water, energy sources (mainly
oil) and even environmental issues may emerge as causes of
future conflict between states.


-----

**The Security Environment**

1.10 The security challenges facing India are varied and
complex. India has two unsettled borders. The country has
experienced four major conventional border wars besides an
undeclared war fought in Kargil in 1999. She is engaged in an
externally abetted proxy war for the last several years in
Jammu and Kashmir and has been combating terrorism
perpetuated by militant and terrorist groups sponsored by a
foreign State. At the same time, a number of insurgencies,
spurred by tribal and ethnic aspirations in addition to left wing
ideologies are being tackled in various parts of the country. A
number of nuclear weapon states are in India’s
neighbourhood; hostile, radical or fundamentalist elements
gaining access to and posing a threat with weapons of mass
destruction (WMD) is also a possibility. It is in such an
environment that the Indian Army is required to fulfil its roles in
varied operating conditions across the entire spectrum of
conflict.

**Nature of Future Warfare**

1.11 Like terrorism today, the likelihood of ‘asymmetric wars’
becoming the form of warfare of tomorrow is being discussed
quite widely. Nonetheless, the fact that all countries continue
to lay emphasis on preparedness for conventional war,
underscores the predominant view that asymmetric wars
cannot replace conventional wars, even though they can very
much become an adjunct of and influence conventional wars
themselves.

1.12 Future wars are likely to be characterised by: 
     - Emerging at short notice, being of short duration
and being fought at high tempo and intensity.

     - Non-linear conduct of operations.

     - Deeper and wider combat zones due to increased
reach of integral firepower and surveillance resources,
including space-based systems.


-----

    - Added emphasis on the all-arms concept and need
for increased jointmanship between the land, naval and
air forces.

    - Enhanced reliance on a variety of surveillance
systems and, resultantly, greater availability of
information contributing to increased transparency of
the battlefield.

    - Improved accuracy, lethality and stand-off capability
of weapons leading to greater destructive capability.

    - Ascendancy of Network Centric Warfare (NCW),
Information Warfare (IW) and conduct of operations
under the glare of the media.

    - Threat from enemy special forces, insurgents and
terrorists to rear areas which will necessitate
earmarking of troops to provide security to lines of
communication.

## SECTION 3 : THE INDIAN ARMY


**_“My Indian Divisions after 1943 were among the best_**

**_in the world. They go anywhere, do anything, go on doing_**
**_it, and do it on very little”._**

**– Field Marshal Sir William Slim, Defeat Into Victory, 1956.**


1.13 **Role of the Indian Army.** The Indian Army is the

land component of the Indian Armed Forces which exist to
uphold the ideals of the Constitution of India. As a major
component of national power, along with the Indian Navy and
the Indian Air Force, the roles of the Indian Army are as
follows :
     - **Primary Role. Preserve national interests and**

safeguard sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of
India against any external threats by deterrence or by
waging war.

     - **Secondary Role.** Assist Government agencies

to cope with ‘proxy war’ and other internal threats and
provide aid to civil authority when requisitioned for the
purpose.

1.14 **Command and Control of the Indian Armed Forces.**

The President of India is the Supreme Commander of the
Indian Armed Forces. As in all democracies, the Indian Armed
Forces are controlled by the elected political leadership of the
nation (Government of India). Executive control is exercised
sequentially through the Union Cabinet, the Defence Minister,
the Chiefs of Staff Committee (COSC) and the Chiefs of Army,
Naval and Air Staff of their respective Services. The Ministry of
Defence handles matters related to personnel, financial and
resource management.

1.15 **Tasks of the Indian Army.  The Indian Army serves**

as the ultimate instrument for maintaining the unity and the
integrity of the nation in  the face of external threats and


-----

internal unrest and disturbances. The major tasks of the Indian
Army are as follows: 
     - Effectively project deterrence and dissuasion
through the medium of strong, well-structured combat
capability.

     - Be prepared to engage in and conduct all types of
military operations, singly or jointly, in the entire
spectrum of conflict.

     - Provide the requisite land forces component of the
Strategic Forces Command.

     - Provide aid to civil authority when called upon to do
so for maintenance of law and order, humanitarian aid
and assistance during disasters and calamities or any
other circumstances including maintenance of essential
services.

     - Participate in United Nations peacekeeping
operations in consonance with India’s commitment to
the United Nations Charter.

     - Be prepared to render military assistance to friendly
countries when required to do so.

## SECTION 4 : PEACE, CONFLICT AND WAR


**_“There never was a good war or a bad peace”._**

**– Benjamin Franklin, 1773.**


**The States of Peace, Conflict and War**

2.1 At any given point in time, a country will be in a state of
peace, conflict or war or a combination of these. Nations act in
their own self-interest which includes the pursuit of political,
economic, ideological or cultural objectives. When the interests
of nations or a group of nations are in harmony, or at least
pose no real or perceived threat to each other, there is peace.
However, when the actions or policies of one nation are
viewed as a threat to the vital interests of another, a condition
of conflict arises. Conflict may escalate to war. The illustration
below depicts the entire spectrum of peace, conflict and war.

-----

2.2 **Peace.  Peace is defined as the absence of violence –**

direct or indirect, manifest or posed as a threat. Peace is often
viewed as a temporary and fleeting condition. To be enduring
and genuine, it must be based on mutual respect, shared
interests and common values. Peace is most often the result of
a balance of power and agreed political spheres of interest
between nations or one nation manifesting a superior political
will. This is invariably backed by preponderance of force which
is militarily unchallenged by others. In either case, peace is
ultimately sustained by, and is dependent upon, the
willingness of states to use force to preserve it as well as
restore it when lost.

2.3 **Conflict.     The essence of conflict is a clash, usually**

violent, between opposing human wills, each trying to impose
itself on the other. In, both, inter-state and intra-state conflicts,
the means to impose one’s will could include diplomatic,
economic and political mechanisms as well as the application
or threat of violence by military force. Military action is just one
instrument, amongst several, which may be used to impose a
nation’s will. Armed conflict is synonymous with war. Today
international mechanisms, including the influence exercised by
major powers, are in place to resolve or limit conflicts because
of their potential to lead to undesired war.

2.4 **The State of War.   War occurs when diplomatic and**

other negotiation mechanisms for resolving conflict or
achieving desired political objectives either fail or are not
operative. In such circumstances political aims and strategies
are pursued by the use of armed force. War is prosecuted by
the employment of strategy which aims at breaking the
enemy’s will to fight. Disengagement from war is difficult
because it develops its own dynamics and pace, which in
themselves are unpredictable and could spin out of control.
While war is always to be avoided, democratic societies must,
nonetheless, be prepared to engage in it to safeguard their
national interests.

**_and devotion to the Lord is its charioteer. O friend,_**
**_whoever possesses such a chariot can never be_**
**_defeated.”_**

**– Lord Rama, Ramayana.**


-----

## SECTION 5 : TYPES OF WARS


**_“War is an act of violence whose object is to_**

**_constrain the enemy to accomplish our will”._**

**– Clausewitz, On War, 1832.**


**CONVENTIONAL WAR**

2.5 Conventional war conforms to the traditional image of
war and is fought to achieve strategic and military objectives. It
does not include the use of Nuclear, Biological and Chemical
(NBC) weapons. It may be total or limited in terms of duration,

the range of weapon systems

employed, scope, objectives and its
ultimate outcome. Given the

prohibitive costs in terms of human
lives and material, as well as the
rising lethality of modern weapons,
conventional war may be of short
duration. Regional wars arise out of
regional issues. The Gulf War (1991)
and the Kosovo conflict (1995) are
two such examples even though they

had repercussions at the international level. A global or
general war is a major unrestricted conflict fought between
major powers involving some or all their allies. Initially it is
likely to employ conventional weapons but may then escalate
to the use of weapons of mass destruction to deny victory to
the opponent(s). An extended global war of the Second World
War pattern is highly unlikely.

**OPERATIONS OTHER THAN WAR**

2.6 Operations Other Than War (OOTW) encompass a
wide range of activities where military power is used for
purposes other than large scale combat operations normally


-----

associated with war. These include sub-conventional and noncombat operations; they usually involve the combined and
coordinated effort of government (civil and military) and nongovernment agencies. In essence, OOTW activities assist to
deter war, resolve conflict and promote peace and well being
with use or demonstrated threat of use of force.

**Sub-Conventional War**

2.7 **Low Intensity Conflict (LIC).  LIC is a generic term**

encompassing all kinds of armed conflicts that are above the
level of peaceful co-existence amongst states and below the
threshold of war. These include proxy war, terrorism and
insurgencies; border skirmishes also fall within this category. It
involves protracted struggle of competing principles and
ideologies. Low Intensity Conflict Operations (LICO) figures at the
lower end of the spectrum of conflict and is characterised by one
or all of the following conditions : 
     - Asymmetry of force levels between the regular forces
and the irregular opposition force.

     - The force applied and the violence generated
depends on the code of conduct and the capabilities of the
weaker side.

     - Laws of the land impose restrictions on the actions of
security forces.

2.8 **Proxy War.** Proxy war is a war conducted between

nations utilising non-state players to fight on their behalf. At
least one of them employs a third party to fight on its behalf.
The extent and type of support provided by the states involved
in proxy war will vary but financial and logistic support are
normally always provided. An example of a proxy war is the
foreign sponsored terrorism in Jammu & Kashmir.

2.9 **Insurgency.  Insurgency is an organised armed**

struggle by a section of the local population against the State,
usually with foreign support. The many possible causes of an
insurgency include nationalistic, ethnic, linguistic, religious or
cultural separatism, poor governance, economic deprivation,
corruption, discrimination and oppression. Its goals may be
seizure of power and replacement of the existing regime or


-----

even liberation of a defined area. Employment of military force
may not be able to stamp out an insurgency but may help to
contain it. In most cases, it is a combination of military force
backed by appropriate political and economic measures which
can adequately resolve such situations. The latter part
acquires even more importance than the use of force.

2.10 **Irregular War.  Irregular war may take many forms of**

which terrorism and guerrilla war are two important ones.
Terrorism is the unlawful use or threatened use of force or
violence against people or property to terrorise, coerce or
intimidate governments or societies; this is most often resorted
to with the aim of achieving political, religious, or ideological
objectives. Terrorism thrives on a fear psychosis and could be
achieved by arson, sabotage, hijacking, hoaxes, maiming,
bombing, seizure, kidnapping, assassination, taking hostages,
raids, ambushes and the threat to use or use of WMD.
Guerrilla war is an irregular form of warfare which includes
acts of subversion, assassination, attack on supply lines and
terrorism. Terrorism and guerrilla warfare can be employed
across the entire spectrum of conflict.

**Non-Combat Operations and Aid to Civil Authorities**

2.11 Non-combat operations are defined as military
operations where the use of force may not be necessary but,
at times, the most minimal use of force, or threat to use force,
may be required. Non-combat operations include aid to civil
authorities, disaster relief, humanitarian assistance and
peacekeeping operations.

**NUCLEAR CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WARFARE**

2.12 **Nuclear Warfare. A conventional war may escalate to**

a nuclear war when any of the belligerents decide to use
nuclear weapons through any means of delivery to avoid
defeat in the sphere of conventional warfare or to safeguard its
vital national interests or even with the aim to bring the war to
a decisive end. World opinion is against the use of such
weapons. India is a nuclear weapon state and pursues a policy


-----

of ‘Credible Minimum Deterrence’ and ‘No First Use’. India’s
nuclear policy clearly states that she will not use or use the
threat of use of nuclear weapons against those states which
do not possess nuclear weapons or are not aligned with
nuclear weapon powers. India reserves the right to retaliate
with nuclear weapons in case of a strike against her by
adversaries with nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.

2.13 **Biological and Chemical Warfare.** International

conventions, to which India is a signatory, along with a large
number of other countries, have banned the use of biological
and chemical weapons. However, their use by adversaries and
non-state actors cannot be ruled out. Chemical weapons are
relatively easy to produce without any elaborate infrastructure.
As a consequence, our forces must be prepared for operations
in a biological and chemical weapons environment. Both,
active and passive defensive measures are being instituted to
cater to this requirement.


**“Slain, you will obtain heaven;**
**_Victorious, you will enjoy earth;_**
**_Therefore, stand up, O son of Kunti,_**
**_Resolved to fight”_**

**_– The Bhagawad Gita._**


-----

**INFORMATION WARFARE**


**_“Information Warfare, in its most fundamental sense,_**

**_is the emerging ‘theatre’ in which future nation-against-_**
**_nation conflict at the strategic level is most likely to_**
**_occur”._**

**– George J. Stein, Cyber War, 2000.**


2.14 IW can be defined as actions taken to achieve
‘information superiority by adversely affecting the adversary’s
information, information-based processes, information
systems, and computer-based networks whilst simultaneously
protecting one's own information, information-based
processes, information systems and computer-based
networks’. Correct and timely information made available to
commanders at all levels contributes directly to effective
Command and Control (C[2]) and helps in shortening the
Observe-Orient-Decide-Act (OODA) Cycle (also known as the
OODA Loop). IW has a vital impact upon the first three
activities of the OODA Loop by disrupting the enemy's
observation and surveillance systems, corrupting his
orientation and misguiding his perception and thereby inducing
him to arrive at wrong decisions.

2.15 **Objectives of IW. The basic ingredients of IW are**

collection of data, sifting (to extract relevant information),
analysis and assimilation of information to create intelligence
which will help to achieve the objectives of IW. These
objectives are:
     - Develop and maintain a comprehensive information
base of the capabilities of adversaries and forecast their
likely actions.

     - Deny information about own and friendly forces to
adversaries.

     - Influence perceptions, plans, actions and the will of
adversaries to oppose own and friendly forces by
offensive employment of IW techniques.


-----

     - Influence non-combatant and neutral organisations
to support friendly missions or, at least, not to resist
friendly activities.

     - Protect friendly decision-making processes,
information and information systems.

     - Degrade the information systems of adversaries.

**Forms of IW**

2.16 The seven forms of IW are Command and Control
Warfare (C[2]W), Intelligence Based Warfare (IBW), Electronic
Warfare (EW), Psychological Warfare, Cyber Warfare,
Economic Information Warfare and Network Centric Warfare
(NCW). These are discussed in succeeding paragraphs.

2.17 **Command and Control Warfare.  The aim of C[2]W is**

to influence, deny information to, degrade or destroy enemy C[2 ]

capabilities while protecting own C[2 ] systems against such
actions. C[2]W is a dominant component of IW in the military
arsenal. C[2]W operations integrate and synchronise the
capabilities of EW, military deception, physical destruction,
psychological operations and operational security.

2.18 **Intelligence Based Warfare.    IBW is a traditional**

component of IW and occurs when intelligence is directly fed
into operations (notably targeting and battle damage
assessment) to bring transparency to the battlefield rather than
being used as an input for overall C[2]. IBW is the direct
application of battlefield intelligence instantaneously into the
battle and aims at creating an asymmetry in the level of
transparency or situational awareness in relation to the enemy.

2.19 **Electronic Warfare.  EW is a set of military actions**

taken to deny the use of the electro-magnetic spectrum to
hostile forces while retaining the ability to use it oneself. This
basically implies that the endeavour is to deny, degrade, delay
or disrupt information in order to create a false picture so that
the enemy is duped into making incorrect assessments and
taking wrong actions. EW involves the use of electro-magnetic
and directed energy to control the electro-magnetic spectrum


-----

or to attack the enemy. One of the most important
developments in the field of EW has been the introduction of
automated and integrated EW systems, which provide a high
degree of information in addition to interception, directionfinding and jamming activities.

2.20 **Psychological Warfare.** Information is one of the

several means to target the human mind. Psychological
warfare is achieved through mass media such as newspapers,
radio and television broadcasts and distribution of leaflets. The
prevailing state of information technology allows effective
psychological warfare to be conducted in a very subtle
manner. In order to be effective, psychological operations
need to be conducted in conjunction with other operations.
During peace time and in LIC operations, this effort can be
termed as “psychological initiatives”.

2.21 **Cyber Warfare.** This entails techniques to destroy,

degrade, exploit or compromise the enemy’s computer-based
systems. Cyber warfare includes exclusive attacks, known as
hacking, on enemy computer networks. Computer hacking has
evolved to a stage wherein information stored or passing
through computer networks is interfered with to degrade the
adversary’s C[2 ]structure.

2.22 **Economic Information Warfare.  This form of warfare**

uses information as power to destabilise the economy of the
adversary. Since all revenue-generating industries of a country
such as aviation, transport, power, banking and the like use
computer-based systems, IW at the strategic level can play
havoc with the national economy of the adversary.

2.23 **Network Centric Warfare.** NCW focuses on the

combat power that can be generated by the effective linking or
networking of the war-fighting machinery and organisations.
The basic elements necessary to generate the requisite
shared battle-space awareness that can be exploited through
self-synchronisation to achieve the overall objective are given
below: 
     - A virtual sensors grid that would provide a ‘grid of
capabilities’ overlaying the battle-space instead of


-----

series of independent single sensors. This grid is
termed as the Surveillance Grid.

- To leverage the strength of the worldwide
telecommunications infrastructure, all communication
networks could be viewed as virtual grids overlaying the
tactical, operational and strategic areas. This grid is
referred to as the Communications Grid.

- An abstract grid that comprises weapons available,
sorted by suitability and availability against a hostile
order of battle is termed as the Tactical Grid.

## SECTION 6 : PRINCIPLES OF WAR


**_“There exists a small number of fundamental_**

**_principles of war, which may not be deviated from_**
**_without danger, and the application of which, on the_**
**_contrary, has been in all times crowned with glory”._**

**– Jomini, Precis de l’ Art de la Guerre, 1838.**


2.24 The Principles of War are broad guidelines which
influence the conduct of war at every level of military
operations. They are based on past experience wherein their
application with judgement led to victory. They are not rules;
yet disregarding them involves risk and could result in failure.
These principles are outlined briefly in succeeding paragraphs.

2.25 **Selection and Maintenance of Aim. The aim is**

expressed as an intention, purpose or end state. It should be
selected carefully, defined clearly and stated simply and
directly. Once selected, it must be maintained.

2.26 **Maintenance of Morale.** Morale is one of the more

important elements of war. High morale fosters the offensive
spirit and the will to win.

2.27 **Offensive Action.  Offensive action is the chief means**

of achieving victory. It results from offensive spirit and helps in
the seizure and maintenance of initiative.

2.28 **Surprise.** Surprise implies catching the enemy off

balance thereby forcing him to give battle in circumstances
unfavourable to him.

2.29 **Concentration of Force.  Concentration of superior**

force at the chosen place and time ensures success in battle.

2.30 **Security. Security relates to the physical protection of**

ground, troops, equipment, material and documents. It also
involves denial of information.


-----

2.31 **Economy of Effort.** Economy of effort connotes

balanced deployment and judicious employment of forces to
ensure success with minimum casualties.

2.32 **Flexibility.** Flexibility is the capability to react

appropriately to changing situations.

2.33 **Cooperation.    All agencies involved have to work**

jointly towards achievement of the overall aim to achieve
success in war. Jointmanship leads to cooperation;
cooperation produces synergy.

2.34 **Administration.  Placing the resources required at the**

right place and time to help commanders at all levels to
achieve their respective objectives is the function of
administration.

2.35 **Intelligence.  This is an addition to the widely**

accepted principles of war because of its pre-eminence in any
future conflict. Military Intelligence involves acquisition and
exploitation of information about the enemy. Informatics plays
a major role in ensuring that intelligence is available in time
and in the desired form.


**_“War should be made methodically for it should_**

**_have a definite object; and it should be conducted_**
**_according to the principles and rules of the art”._**

**– Napoleon, Maxims of War, 1831.**

-----

## SECTION 7 : ELEMENTS FOR OPERATIONAL
 SUCCESS

**_“War is an art and as such is not susceptible of_**
**_explanation by fixed formula.”_**

**– General George S. Patton, Jr, War As I Knew It, 1947.**

3.1 **Operational Success.  War is a national undertaking**

that is coordinated from the highest levels of policy-making to
the basic levels of execution. The objective of military forces
in war is to achieve early and decisive victory over the
opposing forces with minimum casualties to own forces. The
major aspects that contribute towards operational success
are: 
     - Understanding the various perspectives of war.

     - Employing operational art.

     - Judicious application of combat power.

     - Efficient exercise of C[2 ]in the battlefield.

**Perspectives of War**

3.2 The perspective of war varies based on which level it is
viewed from even though the objectives to be achieved at
strategic, operational and tactical levels would flow downwards
from the top. For clarity of understanding of the complex
nature of operational scenarios, it is imperative that the
commanders at all levels recognize the fine differences
between the three levels of perspective given in succeeding
paragraphs. These perspectives are, however, not mutually
exclusive and do tend to overlap at the fringes.

3.3 **Strategic Perspective.   Viewed from the strategic**

perspective, war is a continuum to secure national policy
objectives in concert with defined or perceived national
security goals. The end state of a war must provide the


-----

desired political advantage. Military activity at the strategic
level will thus be clearly influenced by political and national
considerations. At the strategic level, military power is one of
the elements of national power available to a state to achieve
its goals and enforce its policies. A military commander at the
strategic level would be required to render advice to political
leaders which should be in the form of strategic inputs through
the established chain of command. Strategy itself has various
levels. At the apex there is ‘grand’ or national strategy which
coordinates the overall approach pertaining to each element of
national power, such as national will, economic, political,
geographic and military power. Whereas military strategy is
only concerned with military operations, grand strategy must,
of necessity, take a long-term view and therefore encompass
all elements of national power. Military strategy has been
defined as the art of distributing and applying military means to
fulfil ends of national policy. A more modern definition could be
‘the art and science of employing the armed forces of a nation
to secure policy objectives by the application of force or threat
of use of force’. In formulating military strategy it is important to
note that it encompasses the following salient aspects: 
     - Identifying aims and objectives in a theatre of war.

     - Outlining the general course of major operations
and campaigns.

     - Understanding the restrictions placed on military
operations based on national policy.

     - Allocating adequate resources for successful
conduct of operations.

3.4 **Operational Perspective. The operational perspective**

focuses on achieving military aims or objectives at the theatre
level and coordinating the effort of the land, air and naval
forces where and when applicable. The operational level uses
tactical results to achieve strategic objectives. It involves
planning of a campaign within the specified time and space to
achieve desired strategic goals. Viewed in comparison to the
tactical level, it covers larger areas of conflict, has a larger time
and space horizon and has a more critical impact on theatre


-----

level operations. Major elements of the operational level of war
are: 
     - Substantial combat power is kept out of contact till
the opportune time. This is in sharp contrast to the
tactical perspective wherein opposing forces actually
see and engage each other and is thus more narrowly
focused on specific military objectives.

     - The operational perspective provides a wide
enough view for the commander to enjoy independent
command of military forces but is narrow enough to be
relatively free of having to coordinate with the other
elements of national strategy.

     - Nonetheless, there is a need for a clear
understanding of the strategic perspective.

     - An operational perspective prevents a commander
from over-identification with tactical battles. It is
concerned with translation of abstract strategic aims to
achievable tactical objectives through the design,
organisation and conduct of major operations.

3.5 **Tactical Perspective.** The tactical perspective,

having the narrowest view in the hierarchy of war, essentially
concerns itself with optimising the application of military forces
to achieve specified objectives. This level focuses on the
application of combat power to defeat the enemy in combat at
a particular time and place. It includes the employment of
firepower and manoeuvre, the integration of different arms and
the exploitation of success. Commanders at this level concern
themselves with purely military objectives laid down for them,
such as destroying enemy forces, seizing specific objectives or
denying specific pieces of ground and so on. The means used
in tactics are combined-arms formations and the ends are
tactical victories. These engagements may be more than one,
running concurrently in a theatre of operations spread over
hundreds of kilometres. Seemingly disjointed in application of
force, they are, nevertheless, bound to a common higher goal.
A link is required to bring these various tactical pieces together
to create the military conditions that can achieve strategic
goals. That link is the operational level and it is for this reason


-----

that tactical battles are built and fought around an over-arching
operational design.

3.6 **Level of Conduct.  In our context, the operational level**

of war is generally at the Theatre or the Command level, while
tactical level operations are conducted at Corps and lower
levels. However, in certain cases where a Corps has been
allocated an operationally strategic objective, it would be
deemed to be conducting operations at the operational level.
At times, depending upon the spectrum of conflict such as in
LICO, there could be situations where even commanders
subordinate to Theatre (Command) and Corps will have to
work on an operational perspective as their activities may
directly influence the achievement of strategic objectives in a
theatre of operations.

3.7 **Operational Art.  In seeking to structure major**

operations, battles and engagements in pursuit of objectives,
the operational level commander should design his campaign
plans around a number of building blocks which help him to
visualise as to how the operation would unfold. His skills at this
stage form the essence of operational art. Based on the
desired end state, he derives operational objectives, decides
upon the ‘centres of gravity’, ‘lines of operation’ and ‘decisive
points’ and analyses the options thrown up by the conclusions
drawn from these. He must also keep in mind the importance
of ‘shaping the battlefield’ by the employment of firepower and
manoeuvre, maintaining the tempo and factoring in operational
pauses when drawing up plans.

**End States**

3.8 **Conflict Termination.** Conflict is either resolved or

terminated; military force contributes by the defeat of an
opposing force. Defeat is defined as ‘diminishing the
effectiveness of the enemy to the extent that he is either
unable to participate in combat or, at least, not being able to
fulfil his intention’. Conflict termination describes the point at
which the principal means of conflict shifts from the use of
force to other means of persuasion. Conflict termination may
take several forms; for example, the adversary may surrender,
withdraw or negotiate an end to the conflict. Commanders and


-----

staff must plan for conflict termination requirements when
developing campaign plans.

3.9 **Exit Policy. Victory may not always be an appropriate**

term to describe the desired outcome of an operation; it may
have to be defined in other terms such as reconciliation,
stabilisation (acceptance of the status quo) or acceptance of
an agreed peace plan. Where such acceptance is hesitant or
reluctant, the prospect is of protracted involvement. While
planning conflict termination it will be prudent to plan a suitable
‘exit policy’ which should cater to various contingencies related
to politico-military aims.

**Application of Combat Power**

3.10 **Combat Power.** Combat power defines an army’s

ability to fight. It’s three basic components – conceptual, moral
and physical – have been dilated upon in Section 8.
Overwhelming combat power is achieved when all combat
elements are brought to bear simultaneously with violence,
giving the enemy no opportunity to respond in a coordinated or
cohesive manner, and thereby achieve victory at least cost.

3.11 **Modes of Application of Combat Power.   In combat**

the intention is to bring about strategic dislocation of the
adversary by causing psychological paralysis amongst its
decision-makers. In the physical and logistical planes this is
produced by a combination of IW, securing or isolation of
critical objectives, threatening other objectives, capture of high
value territory and selective destruction of the adversary’s
combat potential. The means to achieve such a state include
the following: 
     - **Destruction.** Physical destruction of the enemy’s

capability to fight is but one of a number of means to
defeat him. This would require focused and coordinated
application of decisive combat power.

     - **Attacking the Enemy’s Will.  Conflict is subject**

to political, economic, ethical and moral constraints.
These limit the freedom of military action. In this
context, attempting to destroy the enemy’s will solely by
direct attack on his forces may be, both, costly and, at


-----

times, counter-productive. He must be made to feel
constantly off-balance by one or more of the means
enumerated below: 
   - **Pre-emption.** To pre-empt the enemy is to seize

an opportunity, often fleeting, before he does, in order
to deny him an advantageous course of action. Its
success lies in the speed with which the situation is
subsequently exploited. Pre-emptive operations rely
on rapid decision-making and surprise rather than
ponderous preparation.

   - **Dislocation.** To dislocate the enemy is to deny

him the ability to bring to bear his strengths. Unlike
pre-emption, dislocation is a deliberate act, and is
critically dependent on sound intelligence rather than
intuition. Its purpose is much wider than the frustration
of the enemy’s plan; it is to render his strength
irrelevant. It seeks to avoid fighting the enemy on his
terms and can be achieved by either avoiding his
strengths or by so fixing them that they cannot be
used effectively. ‘Posturing,’ deep penetration thrusts
and envelopment are classic forms of dislocation.

   - **Disruption.  To disrupt is to attack the enemy**

selectively, to break apart and throw into confusion
the assets which are critical to the employment and
coherence of his fighting power. Its purpose is to
rupture the integrity of the enemy’s fighting potential
and to reduce it to less than the sum total of its
constituent parts. The enemy’s moral and physical
cohesion can be shattered by manoeuvring in a
manner which surprises him, using firepower
selectively to attack targets that contribute to his
cohesion and by imposing on him the effects of tempo
and simultaneity.

**Command and Leadership**

3.12 Command is the legal authority exercised by the
commander over his troops to accomplish his mission. It
carries with it the responsibility for planning, organising,


-----

training, directing, coordinating and controlling military forces
to accomplish assigned, implied or inherent missions together
with administrative responsibility for supply, health, welfare,
morale, discipline, assignment and relief of personnel.

3.13 **Exercise of Command in Battle.  The art of command**

lies in conscious and skilful exercise of authority through
visualisation, decision-making and leadership. Effective battle
command demands timely and correct decisions based on the
accurate and skilful judgement of battle situations. Effective
decision-making combines judgement with information as an
element of combat power. The commander must be able to
perceive the plan being implemented and the critical junctures
where his personal decision-making will facilitate success.
Clear thinking and level-headedness in trying situations greatly
help in recognising the practicability of possible courses of
action before embarking upon one of them.

3.14 **Leadership in Battle.  Yet another essential quality of**

a commander is effective and enlightened leadership. He
should be fully cognizant of the strengths and vulnerabilities of
the force that he commands. Closely overseeing and
monitoring critical junctures in battle, being up forward to read
the situations, offering encouragement and making on-the-spot
decisions, particularly in adverse situations are the hallmarks
of good leadership. Military history is replete with excellent
instances of how great battles were won because of inspiring
and decisive leadership.

3.15 **Command and Control.** Command has two

components – the commander and the C2 systems.
Communication systems, surveillance systems and computer
networks form the backbone of C2 systems and enable
commanders to lead from any point on the battlefield. Reliable
communications are central to such systems. Sound C[2 ]should
ensure unity of effort, provide for centralised direction and decentralised execution, provide an environment for applying
common doctrine and ensure inter-operability. Centralised
direction and de-centralised execution are two key
prerequisites for successful C[2]. Centralised direction is
provided by the national leadership at the national-strategic
level. This is then converted to a joint-services plan cojointly by


-----

the three Services and following which directives are
transmitted to theatre commanders for execution. Informationgathering and decision-making must be centralised to enhance
coordination and control over subordinate forces albeit with
requisite freedom of action for subordinate commanders.

**_“War is a science which depends on art for its_**

**_application.”_**

**– Captain Sir Basil Liddell Hart, Strategy in**
**_Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1929._**


-----

## SECTION 8 : OPERATIONAL READINESS AND
 EFFECTIVENESS

**_“The sword drawn to prevent the drawing of swords”._**

**– Samuel Purchas, Purchas His Pilgrimage, 1612.**

3.16 Operational readiness is the state of preparedness of
an organisation to perform the mission for which it is organised
or designed. Military effectiveness is the standard by which the
Army, from the platoon to the highest levels, is judged in peace
and war. The efficiency with which operational readiness and
effectiveness is achieved also needs to be optimised to ensure
availability of maximum possible combat power when and
where required. The level of operational readiness and
effectiveness of a force has a major bearing on its ability to
launch and successfully conduct operations. Ensuring
operational readiness and effectiveness is a command
responsibility.


-----

**Combat Power**

3.17 The term ‘combat power’ defines an army’s ability to
fight. Combat power has three basic components and their
inter-relationship is shown in the figure below :
**COMBAT POWER**

(Ability to Fight)

**CONCEPTUAL COMPONENT**

(Thought Process)

**Principles of War  Military Doctrine**

**Development**

**MORAL COMPONENT** **PHYSICAL COMPONENT**

(Ability to get People to Fight) (Means to Fight)

**Manpower          Equipment**

**Leadership          Motivation**

**Logistics      Training**

**Basic Morality     Management**

**National Assets and Infrastructure**

3.18 **The Conceptual Component.** This can be

described as the thought process behind the ability to fight. It
is a vital component in that, commanders at various levels
have the benefit of the concepts and doctrines evolved over a
period of time as well as the experience of their predecessors.
It also helps commanders to imbibe a common understanding
of principles and yet allows the freedom of exercising
individual styles of command. The conceptual component
comprises principles of war, military doctrine and development.
The contribution of principles of war and military doctrine
towards accomplishing operational readiness and
effectiveness has already been amplified in earlier sections of
this book. Development requires knowledge, an innovative
approach and a mind open to all aspects of warfare; this
includes force organisation, structuring and equipping of

|MORAL COMPONENT (Ability to get People to Fight) Leadership Motivation Basic Morality Management|PHYSICAL COMPONENT (Means to Fight) Manpower Equipment Logistics Training National Assets and Infrastructure|
|---|---|


-----

various types of units. Commanders also need to keep abreast
of developments taking place in the environment and should
have adequate knowledge of management of change so that
they can work as facilitators. The higher the level of a
commander, the wider should be his knowledge horizon so
that he can understand the necessity to implement the desired
change.

3.19 **The Moral Component.   The** moral component

concerns the ability to get people to fight. Maintenance of
morale is a principle of war and, as such, embraces the moral
and physical aspects of combat power. High morale stems
from sound training, confidence in equipment and good
administration as well as confidence in commanders,
discipline, self-respect and clear knowledge of what is going
on and what is required. Yet the ability to get people to fight is
not just a question of morale; it also involves the following
aspects:
   - **Basic Morality. It is extremely important that the basic**
morality of individuals in the Indian Army is always above
board. Professional honesty, courage of conviction,
integrity, tolerance to accept reality and differing points of
view are some of the essential qualities which should
always be encouraged. The higher the position in the
hierarchy, the greater should be the commitment to moral
values. In addition, a commander should posses the
courage to take hard decisions.

   - **Motivation.  Soldiers who are well motivated, and well**
led work as a team. Teamwork breeds comradeship which,
in turn, leads to pride in belonging to a team and fosters
_esprit de corps._ Motivation thrives on a continuing sense of
purpose and it is the job of the commander to instil this
purpose. Although national will, reflected in Government
directives, serves to give the soldier this sense of purpose,
it is the responsibility of the commander to make soldiers
fully identify with these. It must be clearly understood that
leading soldiers in pursuit of causes that they do not
understand is a daunting task.


-----

   - **Leadership.** There are many definitions of military

leadership. However, most simply defined, military leadership
is the projection of personality and character by the leader to
get soldiers to do what is required of them. Skill in the
techniques of leadership is the foremost quality in the art of
command and contributes very largely to success at all levels
of war.

   - **Management.** Good management can have considerable
bearing upon morale and on military effectiveness. It involves
making the best use of available resources in accomplishment
of the mission. Management skills are essential elements of
good and efficient military leadership.

3.20 **The Physical Component.  The physical component is**
the means to fight. It is defined as the total means of destructive
or disruptive force which a military unit or formation can apply
against the opponent at a given time. The ‘total means’ include
the organising and provisioning of the main elements of combat
power which are manpower, equipment, logistics, training and
national assets.

**Operational Readiness**

3.21 Readiness of the Indian Armed Forces to meet national
emergencies is a facet of national level endeavour. It calls for a
synergised effort by all instruments of the Government to ensure
that these forces are moved to their areas of operations, fullyequipped and within an acceptable timeframe. The Government,
on its part, would indicate and maintain a clear and strong resolve
to go to war when it orders a general mobilisation. There may
also be other methods of preparation for war even without
ordering general mobilisation. On the part of the Armed Forces,
they are responsible for ensuring that they are operationally
ready, troops are in a high state of morale and units are
appropriately trained to execute the missions assigned to them.

3.22 Military mobilisation in the Indian context involves
considerable effort because of the wide geographical spread of
the peacetime locations of our units and formations, the
considerable extent of our borders and the multiplicity of agencies
that need to coordinate their actions in order to make it effective.


-----

## SECTION 9 : SURPRISE AND DECEPTION

**_“Generally, in a conflict,_**
**_The Straightforward will lead to engagement and_**
**_The Surprising will lead to triumph”._**

**– Sun Tzu, The Art of War.**

**Surprise**

3.23 Surprise in war is a potent force multiplier. The payoffs
of surprise are almost always in geometric proportions and it
multiplies the chances of achieving quick and decisive military
victory. As a decisive factor at all levels of warfare, and duly
acknowledged as an autonomous principle of war, surprise
allows the side that achieves it to concentrate superior forces
unnoticed at the point of decision and to beat the opponent in
terms of time, place, method or new technologies. The
purpose of surprise, in essence, is to make the enemy react in
an irrational and uncoordinated manner.

3.24 Strategic surprise can herald both the beginning and
the end of a war. Considering the scope of its effects and the
level at which it is planned, the phenomenon of military
surprise can be classified as strategic, operational or tactical.
However, in practice, the distinction between the strategic and
operational and operational and tactical surprise is often hazy
and they invariably tend to overlap. With battlefield
transparency improving by the day, the ability to effect true
surprise is progressively reducing. Military planners, therefore,
need to concentrate more on deception, as a good and wellcoordinated deception plan would help to achieve surprise.

**Deception**

3.25 Deception needs to be developed as an integral
component of peacetime and wartime national security policy.
Deception is intentional, purposeful, calculated and deliberate.
The target of deception should be the adversary’s decisionmaking system. Deception should create perceptions and
thereafter reinforce them. Deception should aim at misleading
an adversary with regard to detectable information, whether


-----

actual or notional, by obscuring it. Often, the best and simplest
deception is the presentation of the truth but in such a form
that the adversary disbelieves it.

3.26 It must be clearly understood that given today’s
battlefield transparency, deception, in addition to surprise will
be very difficult to achieve in the first instance; retaining the
advantage that flows from it for an appreciable period of time
will be even more difficult. For that reason alone this is one
aspect which will require very thorough study, preparation and
conceptualization.

3.27 Military deception operations are an inherent and
expected responsibility of command at division level and
above. It needs to be coordinated at the highest level to be
effective and, should therefore, be indivisible from all other
parts of the conception, planning and execution of military
operations in peace and war. Deception ought to be intrinsic to
and inseparable from all military thought and action, rather
than a mere annexure, afterthought or an adjunct. The
planning and practice of deception must be systematically
integrated into devising a military strategy.

3.28 The process of deception is interactive and follows the
sequential steps of planning, evaluation, coordination,
integration, approval and execution. On completion of the last
step of execution the situation needs to be re-analysed and
process repeated, if required. The advent of IW offers
unprecedented opportunities for deception operations in
scope, effect and imagination. It is imperative that deception
operations are planned as meticulously as actual operations, if
not more. Deception plans may even be implemented by
designated headquarters, supported by suitable allocation of
resources. Nothing should be left to chance as an unfounded
or unacknowledged assumption, supposition or assertion.
Those charged with planning, approving, and executing
deception operations, as well as the operators, must be
absolutely adept in all the processes that these involve.
Training and exercises should integrate the aspect of
deception and appropriate resources should be instituted to
develop and refine the art.



**_[“Modern technology provides battlefield transparency ]_**

**_and hinders concealment; audacity of plans and speed of_**
**_operations could be potent instruments to gain surprise”._**

**– General NC Vij.**

## SECTION 10 : IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY ON
 OPERATIONS AND THE REVOLUTION IN
 MILITARY AFFAIRS


“Information Warfare has the potential not only, to
**_be a force multiplier, but also to be a force equaliser”._**

**– Michael Loescher, Cyber War, 2000.**


**Impact of Technology on Operations**

3.29 **Emphasis on IW.  With** the induction of better

communication systems and the creation of a networked
environment, our ability to collect, collate and analyse diverse
inputs received from various agencies has been greatly
enhanced. However, the vulnerabilities of such systems to
disruption by the enemy have also increased and its resultant
impact on conduct of operations would be magnified in
proportion to the dependence on it. Due to the dependence of
military forces on such systems, the role of technology in
future warfare has expanded considerably, thereby enlarging
our earlier concept of EW to C[2]W, which incorporates all
functions of command dependent on communications and
computers. Thus in a network-centric environment, the
emphasis will shift to IW and the various active and passive
measures which form part of it.

3.30 **Increased Battlefield Transparency and Situational**

**Awareness.** Today newer and better systems are available

for the conduct of surveillance, identification and monitoring of
the enemy and these have improved situational awareness.
The nature of sensors and their platforms have extended the
range of observation and enhanced the resolution thereby
providing greater accuracy and detail in a shorter timeframes.
The overall aim is to create a technological asymmetry so as
to be in a better position to see, locate and monitor enemy
forces and to plan for their destruction, degradation or
disruption. In such an environment newer techniques or
methods would be required to achieve surprise and deception.


-----

Increased reconnaissance and surveillance capability will
enable manoeuvre force commanders to concentrate superior
combat power at points of decision.

3.31 **Enhancement in Degradation Capability. The range,**

precision and throw-weight of weapon systems have increased
substantially and have greatly enhanced the degradation
capability of all forces. These weapon systems, coupled with

air power, will be used in exploiting gains in battlefield
transparency to shape the battlefield. Enhanced precision and
stand-off engagement capability, along with transparency
sensors, will act as force multipliers.

3.32 **Reduced Reaction Time. The time required for**

passage of information and orders will be reduced due to
improved communications and networking. Accordingly,
greater emphasis will have to be placed on directive style of
command. The use of Command, Control, Communication,
Computers, Intelligence, Information, Surveillance and
Reconnaissance (C[4]I[2]SR) systems will result in expansion of
the battle-space and compression of the time dimension.
However, the adverse impacts of ‘information overload’ on the
decision-making process of own forces need to be borne in
mind and avoided.


-----

3.33 **Night Fighting.** Technology has significantly

improved night fighting capability. The ever increasing
availability of new generation night vision devices will impact
beneficially on tactical concepts.

3.34 **Deception.** Enhanced battlefield transparency will

demand greater emphasis on deception so as to confuse or
deceive the enemy about own movement, concentration, aim
and intended area of operations. Management of the enemy’s
perceptions through C[2]W would become important in the
future. This could well be achieved with modern technology by
attempting to reinforce the enemy’s beliefs and thereafter
employ the tools of IW to blind or mislead enemy surveillance
as part of a well coordinated plan.

3.35 **Enhanced Mobility.** Mobility of ground forces,

especially in the plains and deserts has improved
considerably. Enhanced battlefield transparency will facilitate
and even require a shift from the existing attrition-based or
positional concept of operations to that based predominantly
on manoeuvre in offensive as well as defensive operations.

3.36 **Enlarged Battle Area.  Better surveillance capabilities,**

enhanced mobility of forces in the tactical battle area, longer
ranges of weapon systems, state-of-art communication
systems, information technology enabling effective C[2 ]of forces
over vastly extended areas have enlarged the battle-space.
The ability to conduct non-linear and simultaneous operations
at greater depths adds to the battle-space over which a
commander needs to exercise C[2].

**Revolution In Military Affairs (RMA)**

3.37 Recent conflicts have highlighted the dramatic impact of
technology on warfare. This has caused a significant shift in
the very nature of war-fighting and is bringing about a RMA.
Although we may not have the wherewithal to draw full
benefits from it at present, the underlying message is
unambiguous – technology gives a clear edge and needs to be
exploited to our advantage. We need to conceive and work
towards a ‘homespun’ RMA that meets our needs and gives us
an edge over our potential adversaries. Towards this end it will

be essential to institutionalise methods for assimilating
technology and adapting, and even anticipating, changes in
doctrine, tactics and organisations. In so doing, special
attention needs to be paid to the impact of RMA on LIC and
asymmetric warfare waged by non-state actors.

3.38 RMA is termed as ‘a major change in the nature of
warfare brought about by the innovative application of new
technologies, which, combined with the dramatic changes in
military doctrine, operational concepts and operations,
fundamentally alters the character and conduct of military
operations’.

3.39 The main constituents of RMA are doctrine, technology,
tactics and training. Although the revolution is driven by
technology, changes in doctrine, tactics and training are
equally if not more important. Thus, the RMA, apart from the
aspect of routine evolution that an Army undergoes in the
process of modernisation, involves a transformation in the
nature and conduct of military operations. It is the synergetic
outcome of advances in technology suitably absorbed and
applied by armed forces. There is a need, therefore, to focus
on emerging technologies available to the armed forces to
meet the strategic, operational and tactical requirements of the
future and analyse the effect of cutting-edge technologies on
future requirements. While doing so, aspects relating to
orchestration of human resources and re-orientation of
training, which are imperative for unleashing the full potential
of emerging technologies, must be factored in as technology
alone can not influence the course of war unless there is a
transformation in the manner armed forces think, train and
fight.

3.40 The backbone of RMA is a C[4]I[2]SR system which
facilitates dominant battle-space awareness and will therefore
constitute a major thrust area. Five major components of RMA
are IW, dominant manoeuvre, precision engagement, full
dimensional protection and focused logistics. Advances in
C[4]I[2]SR also make possible a new concept in war fighting viz
NCW.

3.41 Analysis of major components of RMA indicates that
they have great applicability in our context. We may however,
have to follow an incremental approach in embracing these
principles and acquiring the relevant technology. IW will form a
key component of our war fighting doctrine. The excellent
support base and infrastructure in information technology that
is available in the country should be optimally exploited.

3.42 NCW has great potential in our context. We need to
evolve our concept based on our security compulsions.
Investment in ‘infostructure’ is an absolute imperative. This
must be done jointly in conjunction with other Services so that
seamless operations can be undertaken. As we progress to
higher levels of technology, our ability to undertake NCW
operations can be further refined. The advantages of operating
with geographically dispersed forces must be fully exploited
particularly in the backdrop of a nuclearised environment.

3.43 Meeting the challenge of RMA may demand substantial
changes in our concepts, organisational philosophies and,
most of all, attitudes. Concepts and organisational structures
for exploitation of RMA would need to be evolved as the
inevitable move towards greater use of high technology takes
place.

3.44 RMA will have a dramatic effect on the Army and
conduct of warfare through trends like lethality and dispersion,
volume and precision of fires and their effects, processing and
use of information, invisibility and detectability. Technologies
that would need to be invested in are in the spheres of
projecting and protecting the force, decisive operations,
shaping of the battlefield and integrated logistics. Indigenous
development of technologies to achieve self reliance will need
sufficient investment to keep pace with RMA.

3.45 The impact of RMA on LIC is not as dramatic as in the
field of conventional conflict. This does not imply that RMA has
little to do in LIC; on the contrary, technology can play a
significant role in LIC. We need to constantly refine our
doctrines, concepts, organisations and tactics so as to
optimise the effect of RMA in LIC.
