## 2018 Defence White Paper
# Investing in  our people, capabilities  and visibility


-----

-----

## Foreword

We present to you a realistic and future-oriented Defence White Paper, a white paper
which we firmly believe constitutes a starting point for strengthening trust in the
Defence organisation; the trust of our people, trust in our organisation and the trust
of society in the Defence organisation.

After decades of budget cuts, there are new prospects for the future of the Defence
organisation. We are moving forward with a realistic point of view. The discussions
conducted by the state secretary and myself gave us a first-hand impression of just
how important this is.

We discussed matters with individuals at all levels both within and outside our
organisation.

Those discussions will continue, because it is our people who are the strength of the
Defence organisation!

We wish to be transparent and reliable in what we do and what we achieve.
We wish to be an attractive and reliable employer. We are working to firmly embed
the Defence organisation as a whole in society.

Above all, we are realistic. The additional investments will be used to take a major
step forward. A step which we believe should become visible quickly. At the same
time, however, we are aware that a process of building and strengthening takes time.

We are making a good start and realise that we need to think in terms of long-term
objectives. These long-term objectives are set out in this white paper.

And that is because the Ministry of Defence protects what we value!

Also for the State Secretary for Defence,

**THE MINISTER OF DEFENCE**

## Current developments


**Kingdom**
Vulnerable to social disruption (effects
of terrorism, cyber attacks, foreign
interference and irregular migration).
The fragile situation in Venezuela,
drug trafficking and natural disasters
constitute a security risk in the
Caribbean.

**Russia**
Modernisation and strengthening of
the Russian armed forces. Increasing
military activity and hybrid threat.


**Instability near europe and**
**the Kingdom**
Unstable security situation and conflict,
such as in the Middle East, North Africa
and parts of sub Saharan Africa and
West Africa.

**New technologies**
New technologies can be used for
warfare: artificial intelligence, big data
analytics, quantum computing,
robotics, biotechnology, 3D printing.


**Hybrid warfare**
A combination of misleading,
undermining and overtly disruptive
activities. This threat is posed primarily
by state actors.

**Proliferation**
The risk of the use of chemical,
biological, radiological and/or nuclear
weapons has increased.

## Introduction

**The Ministry of Defence protects what we value. Based on the Charter for the**

**Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Constitution of the Kingdom of the**

**Netherlands, this overarching mission encompasses three main tasks:**

**1. Protecting national territory, including the Caribbean part of the Kingdom**

**of the Netherlands, and the territory of allies.**

**2. Protecting and promoting the international legal order and stability.**

**3. Supporting civil authorities with respect to law enforcement, disaster relief**

**and humanitarian assistance, both nationally and internationally.**


apparent in the short term. New
colleagues will be joining us, supply
levels will be improved and more
exercises are being planned.
Furthermore, unnecessary rules will be
abolished and commanders will have
greater discretionary power in the
sphere of practical execution.

We will also become visible again in
society. Military personnel may once
again travel in uniform. After further
consideration, certain Defence sites
throughout the country that had
previously been earmarked for closure
will be maintained. Royal Netherlands
Marechaussee personnel will also
become more visible at the border.
Furthermore, the recruitment of new
employees will be organised at regional
level to augment current national-level
efforts and we will strengthen our
cooperation with other organisations.
We are also collaborating in the
preparation of the community work
placement programme for young
people.

All this will contribute to the versatility
and readiness of the Netherlands
armed forces. NATO has drawn up
capability targets for the Netherlands
which require further steps. Given the
foregoing, this white paper does not
constitute an end point. Rather, it is a
step that is in line with the long-term
objectives that were included in the
NATO agreements made during the
2014 Wales Summit.


We operate in a world that is changing
and becoming less safe. Threats are
complex, diverse and unpredictable.
The vulnerability of the Netherlands
and of people throughout the world
has increased. As a nation, we are
strongly connected with the rest of the
world. The security of the Netherlands
is thus also intertwined with security
situations in other parts of the world.

The first main task, protecting
national territory and the territory
of allies, has therefore become more
important in recent years.
The importance of the other two main
tasks has likewise increased. Because
of the greater instability in the world,
a greater commitment is required for
all of the main tasks. It was with this
in mind that we considered how the
additional investments amounting to
EUR 1.5 billion a year could best be
spent. This is based on the
Netherlands integrated foreign and
security strategy of the Minister of
Foreign Affairs.


First, we will invest in our people.
They keep us safe and are there when
they are needed. We want to restore
their trust in the organisation and
thereby ensure that they remain with
the organisation. Moreover, we want to
recruit new employees and will focus
on diversity. We will also invest in
means. The emphasis in this regard will
be on modernising our current strike
capabilities and strengthening our
information-driven operating methods.
The third key area of investment will be
methods. We will focus efforts in this
area on increasing and improving
national and international cooperation
to ensure that the organisation evolves
into one that is robust and agile.

We will make every effort in the coming
years to implement the measures set
out in this white paper. In many cases,
results will only become visible after a
few years. That is unfortunately the
reality we face. It takes time to attract
and train people, produce material and
make it operational. Nevertheless, a
number of changes will become

## What we want to achieve


**To remain safe**
In the Netherlands, the Kingdom,
the EU and NATO territory.


**To foster security**
Around Europe (the Middle East, North
Africa and parts of sub-Saharan Africa
and West Africa).


**To connect securely**
From the Netherlands as a hub and its
lines of communication.


**For example:**


**For example:**


-----

## What we want to be


we must above all strengthen our
strike capabilities and sustainability
(the length of time we can sustain a
mission). NATO has expressed
concerns in this regard. We take those
concerns seriously.

In the current government’s term of
office, therefore, we will work to
further detail the long-term objectives
that need to be in place to ensure the
stable funding and strengthening of
the armed forces. We will do this on
the basis of the 2014 NATO agreement,
under which NATO member states
pledged to increase their defence
spending to two percent of GDP by
2024. A step-by-step increase in the
context of these long-term objectives
aimed at achieving NATO’s capability
targets will be included in the review of
the Defence White Paper. This review is
scheduled to take place in 2020.

Any potential further step in the
current government’s term of office
will be considered at the appropriate
time in the light of developments in
the security situation, governmentwide priorities, and within the agreed
budgetary frameworks.


The past decades have been
challenging for our people. We want
to restore trust and be an organisation
that people are proud to work for.
We also intend to be an organisation
that is visible in society. We do not
want the armed forces to be eroded by
an imbalanced composition (means) or
by the imposition of unrealistically
high demands on our people. We are
therefore working to ensure that the
fundamentals of the organisation are
as they should be, also as regards
safety. This process will take time and
requires perseverance and a change in
organisational culture.

At the same time, the deterioration of
the security situation means that the
armed forces are now expected to
perform an increasing number of
tasks, both within the Netherlands and
in the context of NATO’s common
defence and EU defence cooperation.
NATO stresses that larger and more
robust units are needed. These units
must also be rapidly deployable.
The probability that the armed forces
will be required to simultaneously


conduct operations in the Netherlands
and abroad has also increased. We are
therefore abandoning “level of
ambition” as the yardstick for
determining what we can do, because
the armed forces are not deployed as a
matter of “ambition”, the armed forces
are deployed as a matter of necessity.

We must be capable of taking effective
action if necessary (robustness) and of
responding appropriately to the rapid
and unpredictable changes that are
taking place around us (agility). We are
meeting this need with the adaptive
forces concept. Cooperation with our
partners is essential in this regard.
Focusing on the development of an
information-driven organisation that
meets high quality and technological
standards at all times will also
significantly increase our robustness
and agility.

NATO has stated that, despite the
investments, the Netherlands remains
incapable of meeting many of the
capability targets fully. In a world that
is changing and becoming less secure,


**What we want to be**


**» A reliable and committed employer that people are proud to work for.**

**» A safe organisation that learns from mistakes.**

**» Transparent and visible in an engaged society.**

**» A good partner to civil authorities, civil society organisations,**

**the business community and our strategic partners and allies.**

**» An organisation whose fundamentals are as they should be.**

**» Robust and agile.**

**» Rapidly deployable at all levels of force.**

**» An organisation that meets high quality and technological standards**

**at all times.**

**» An information-driven organisation.**


**Being an information-driven**
**organisation means that we are**
capable of acquiring, processing and
disseminating, in good time and at any
level required, all relevant information
so that, to the greatest extent possible,
we can be in the right place at the right
time with the specific assets required in
the given context. The ability to take
intelligence led action imposes
requirements regarding the materiel
used by the armed forces and the
organisation’s way of working.

## What we are going to do

**People**


Our people have been through a
difficult time. We wish to close that
particular chapter. We spent the past
months talking to people: what are
they unhappy about, what can we do
better, and how? We will make the
personnel system more flexible, offer
personalised solutions, provide
stability and good equipment and help
to create opportunities prior to, during
and after the military career. We must
also work together to achieve a
working environment that is as safe as
possible. A plan of action is being
drawn up. This plan will contain
measures to make working for the
Defence organisation safer.

In the meantime, the labour market is
evolving rapidly. The composition of
the working population is changing.
The number of women and individuals
with an immigrant background is
increasing, for example. The wishes and
requirements of the new generation of
jobseekers in terms of their employer
are changing too.

It is clear that we must make additional
efforts to be an attractive employer,
not least because to fully staff our
organisation will be a major challenge.
We will therefore focus on overcoming
this challenge with a strategic
personnel policy and by identifying
other ways of recruiting and retaining
personnel, entering into partnerships
in the recruitment of scarce personnel,
appropriately amending internal
regulations and giving commanders
more powers and options. Further
measures that we will be taking are
described in Appendix II.


**Measures**

**» Our people will have more career opportunities, also in terms of training courses,**

**and future prospects. The agreement on terms and conditions of employment**

**provides points of reference in this regard.**

**» We will improve and simplify the allowances system, with a specific focus on**

**allowances, including those for the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee, that are**

**linked to regular absences from home.**

**» We will offer personalised solutions, such as the option of temporary departure**

**from the organisation, flexible (part-time) employment contracts and of course**

**the option of serving as a reservist.**

**» We will modify the personnel system (FPS) as soon as possible to ensure that the**

**right people get the right jobs and are retained by the organisation.**

**» We will make it possible for employees to hold a specific position for longer,**

**which will result in greater stability and knowledge for both the organisation as a**

**whole and its individual employees.**

**» Our people will have high-quality equipment and more opportunities to**

**participate in exercises and training.**

**» We will improve accommodation and healthcare for our people.**

**» The availability of wireless internet will be improved at all locations.**

**» We will work to make the organisation more diverse in terms of its human**

**capital by broadening the appeal of our recruitment effort.**

**» We will ensure that the working environment is as safe as it can be for our people.**

**» We will become an organisation that learns from mistakes.**

**» We will increase the current compensation arrangement for the state pension**

**shortfall from 90% to 100%.**

**» We will set up a national “debt of honour” fund (Nationaal Fonds Ereschulden) for**

**military personnel who have sustained a disability, trauma or other illness or**

**injury during a mission abroad.**

**» As a tribute to the sacrifices of our veterans and the veterans of other countries,**

**we are supporting the initiative to host the Invictus Games in The Hague in 2020.**

**» We will undertake efforts to conclude a social agreement with other government**

**organisations and the business community to jointly guarantee training and**

**career opportunities.**

**» We will shorten waiting times so that people, including reservists, can start**

**working for the Defence organisation sooner.**


-----

**Means**

These measures will modernise and
strengthen our striking power and our
sustainability. All of the measures
relate to capabilities required by NATO
and are in keeping with the
Netherlands integrated foreign and
security strategy. The measures are
necessary for the execution of our
constitutional tasks and, in this
context, for deployments in the
Netherlands and under NATO, EU or UN
auspices. In view of the financial
resources available, however, we
cannot meet all of NATO’s capability
targets. We have therefore set the
following priorities:

**1. The armed forces must remain**
versatile in terms of deployability
because threats differ greatly in
nature and intensity and the security
environment is constantly changing.

**2. We will first modernise our existing**
weapon systems. Our adversaries are
producing or acquiring increasingly
technologically advanced weapons.
We must respond to this development, also to keep our people as safe
as possible.

**3. We will increasingly operate on an**
information-driven basis with the aid
of a solid IT infrastructure.

The priorities outlined above result in
an investment programme as set out in
**Appendix IV.**


**» We will ensure that fundamentals are as they should be in terms of readiness,**

**operational support and the necessary replacement of weapon systems.**

**» We will modernise and strengthen the armed forces and adhere in this regard to**

**high-quality technological standards. What we do we will do well, also in terms**

**of future proofing.**

**» We will make information-driven performance a reality by investing heavily in**

**cyber, intelligence, IT, and information-gathering capabilities and the Defence**

**Intelligence and Security Service, and in the information domain as a whole.**

**» We will replace the fleet and focus expressly in this regard, as will be the case in**

**all replacement programmes, on international cooperation.**

**» We will increase the deployability of fighter aircraft and helicopters.**

**» We will modernise our weapon systems (midlife updates), such as the Bushmaster**

**(all wheel drive armoured vehicle), Fennek (armoured reconnaissance vehicle),**

**CV90 (infantry fighting vehicle), self-propelled howitzer, Apache (attack helicopter),**

**landing transport dock (LPD) and hydrographic survey vessels.**

**» We will increase the capacity of the Defence Explosive Ordnance Disposal Service.**

**» We will strengthen defences against chemical, biological, radiological and**

**nuclear (CBRN) threats.**

**» We will replace the personal equipment of military personnel, including the tactical**

**vests and ballistic protection gear. All handguns will also be modernised gradually.**

**» We will keep open certain Defence sites that had previously been earmarked for**

**closure. We will therefore be able to accommodate the organisation’s expansion.**

**Moreover, keeping these sites open will raise our profile in society.**

**» On the basis of earlier decisions, Royal Marechaussee capacity will be increased**

**for border control and the management of migration flows.**


Considerable efforts are being made to
improve readiness (are we ready to do
what is necessary?) and strengthen
operational (combat) support
(the support required prior to and
during an armed deployment).
The level of readiness and quality
of operational support must be high
because readiness and operational
support constitute the foundation of all
our deployments. This is a continuous
process that never ends.

**Measures**


Moreover, much depends on achieving
and maintaining appropriate staffing of
the organisation. Fortunately, the
results are becoming increasingly
tangible in the workplace. Examples in
this regard include the availability of
spare parts, maintenance capacity and
ammunition for training.
All this should result in a modern force
that is better equipped to deal with
current and future threats. Further
measures are described in Appendix II.


-----

**Methods**

Organisational agility is vital to
improving our ability to respond to
the constantly changing security
environment. Knowledge and means
must be available at the right time. At
the same time, we have to be there
when we are needed, and that requires
robustness. Being both agile and robust
requires smart solutions, flexibility and
collaboration. Developments in NATO,
the EU and the Netherlands are
providing new opportunities in this
regard. To ensure agility and robustness,
we will change our way of working, our
conduct and our organisational culture:
we have responsibility and we take it,
we are transparent and open, and we
do not make a means to an end an end
in itself.


**Measures**

**» We will cooperate more closely with our allies and strategic partners,**

**other government organisations, civil society organisations and the business**

**community. This cooperation will focus on personnel, knowledge and**

**innovation, the procurement and maintenance of materiel, and exercises,**

**training and deployment. It will make us stronger and help us to respond to**

**new developments.**

**» Together with the Ministry of Justice and Security, we are reviewing civil military**

**cooperation. Our aim in this regard is to increase the resilience of society and**

**better protect the vital infrastructure and digital security of the Netherlands.**

**» We will improve the coordination and management of Host Nation Support.**

**It is important for us to be capable of providing the support and security**

**required if our allies need to transport their units and equipment via the**

**Netherlands. Host Nation Support will be required more frequently in the**

**coming years. Moreover, we will undertake efforts to simplify the cross-border**

**transport of military capabilities within Europe (military mobility).**

**» We will form a conflict prevention unit that will serve as the coordinator of**

**foreign defence efforts aimed at preventing conflict and as the point of contact**

**for partners in the Netherlands and abroad. This unit will be formed in close**

**cooperation with the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Foreign**

**Trade and Development Cooperation.**

**» We are among the leading nations of the Permanent Structured Cooperation**

**(PESCO) pact in intensifying military cooperation in the EU and are actively**

**contributing to the EU planning process established last year.**

**» We will press for a more open European defence market with a level playing field.**

**» In the case of tendering processes, we will interpret Article 346 of the TFEU**

**(Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) broadly and thereby take the**

**security interests of the Netherlands into account.**

**» As regards procurement, we will adhere to the principles of “fast, unless” and**

**“off the shelf, unless”. This will of course apply in the case of proven technology.**

**» Where possible, we will leave the procurement of non-defence-specific items**

**and services to external parties.**

**» We will prioritise research into new threats and opportunities posed by**

**new technologies. We will join the European Defence Fund and the Top**

**Sectors policy.**

**» We will scrutinise internal regulations and processes.**

**» Commanders and units will be granted more powers and resources to ensure**

**that they are in a position to make the right choices. This independence on**

**the part of commanders and units will make the organisation more effective**

**and agile.**


An adaptive force responds rapidly to
changes in the security environment

- We can be deployed more effectively
and for longer periods of time
through collaboration (with, for
example, hospitals, educational
institutions and technology
companies, and by engaging
reservists).

- We continuously innovate to
anticipate new threats and
developments more rapidly
and accurately.

- By adjusting our internal processes
(procurement and readiness, for
example), we can make additional
capabilities available as and
when necessary.


Further measures are described in
**Appendix II.**

## How we will achieve future-proof funding


about the planning of expenditure will
be provided within the framework of
the regular budget cycle.


Our aim is to make the funding, like
the organisation, shock resistant,
transparent and predictable.
These qualities constitute an important
step towards achieving stable and
future-proof funding of the armed
forces. They will also make it easier to
plan materiel projects, which will in
turn expedite progress. After all, we
have no time to lose. Appendix III
provides a brief overview of how the
additional financial resources made
available under the coalition agreement are being spent.

It is important to be aware that
implementation of the measures set
out in this policy document will not be
completed overnight. This is true not
only with respect to achieving and
maintaining staffing levels and the
purchase of major equipment, such as
ships. It also often takes a considerable
amount of time to make more
“ordinary” items, such as ammunition
and communications equipment,
deployment ready. This also means
that, in the first years of the current
government’s term of office, we will

_1 Projects that are already being implemented are not_
_included. These are listed in the MPO that you received_
_with the 2018 budget._


not be spending the entire amount
made available for those years under
the coalition agreement. Information


**Measures**


**» Investments amounting to EUR 1.5 billion a year will make it possible for us to**

**fund the current armed forces on a sustainable basis (and achieve a better**

**balance between support and combat units).**

**» We will draft proposals aimed at increasing the predictability and shock resistance**

**of the materiel budget. Measures in this regard may include the use of a specific**

**price index or a structural solution to currency fluctuations, for example.**

**» We are working on the basis of an investment programme in which all replacement**

**and modernisation-related investments, also regarding IT and property, have been**

**included for the next fifteen years. From the 2019 budget onwards, the investment**

**programme will be included in Article 6 “Armed Forces Investments”, the planning**

**horizon of which will then be extended to fifteen years. The programme for all**

**investments in excess of EUR 25 million is set out in Appendix IV.**

**» We will inform you on an annual basis of all current and future investment**

**projects in the material projects overview (Materieel Projecten Overzicht, MPO). The**

**reporting period in the MPO will also be extended to fifteen years.**

**» Each year, prior to the budget debate, we will comprehensively discuss all of the**

**investment plans with the House of Representatives. Investment planning will**

**therefore constitute the starting point for the investment decisions that need to**

**be made, and the annual budget debate in the House of Representatives means**

**that we will implement those decisions. In accordance with the Defence materiel**

**process (Defensie Materieel Proces, DMP), the House of Representatives will receive**

**information letters regarding the statement of requirements (A letter), the**

**investigation phase (B letter) and any follow up investigation (C letter).**

**Procurement decisions (D letter) will be submitted to the House of**

**Representatives for debate.**

**» We are working on a cost-to-readiness model to gain better insight into the**

##### Appendix I
## Charter, Constitution, main tasks  and treaty obligations


**The defence efforts of the**

**Netherlands are based on the Charter**

**for the Kingdom of the Netherlands,**

**the provisions pertaining to the**

**armed forces in the Constitution of**

**the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the**

**main tasks of the armed forces and**

**international treaty obligations. It is**

**therefore appropriate to consider**

**what the provisions referred to**

**actually mean.**

**Constitution and main tasks**
According to Article 2 of the Charter,
maintaining the independence of the
Kingdom and the defence of
the Kingdom are a matter for the
Kingdom. Article 97 of the
Constitution goes on to state the
following: “There shall be armed
forces for the defence and protection
of the interests of the Kingdom, and in
order to maintain and promote the
international legal order.” The
reference in this article to the national
legal order is closely linked to Article
90, which states that the government
shall promote the development of the
international legal order. Pursuant to
Article 100 of the Constitution, the
government shall “inform the States
General in advance if the armed forces
are to be deployed or made available
to maintain or promote the international legal order. This shall include


the provision of humanitarian aid in
the event of armed conflict.” The
specific Frame of Reference
(“Toetsingskader”) is used in this
regard. The tasks performed by the
armed forces in support of civil
authorities are largely based on legislation and a variety of administrative
agreements. These tasks include
planned and regular activities and
the provision of military assistance
and support.

Based on the constitutional provisions
referred to above and other legislation
and regulations, the Ministry of
Defence has the following three main
tasks:

**1. Protecting national territory,**
including the Caribbean part of the
Kingdom of the Netherlands, and
the territory of allies.
**2. Protecting and promoting the**
international legal order and
stability.
**3. Supporting civil authorities with**
respect to law enforcement, disaster
relief and humanitarian assistance,
both nationally and internationally.

**International treaty obligations**
The most important international
treaty obligations of the Netherlands
arise from the Charter of the United
Nations (UN Charter), the North
Atlantic Treaty and the EU Treaty of
Lisbon. The UN Charter prohibits the


threat or use of force in international
relations. By virtue of this general
prohibition, if the UN Security Council
determines that there is a threat to
the peace or that a breach of the
peace or an act of aggression has
occurred, it may decide that armed
force should be employed to maintain
or restore international peace and
security. Furthermore, self-defence is
permitted under Article 51 of the UN
Charter.

The obligation of collective defence of
NATO territory as laid down in Article 5
of the North Atlantic Treaty (1949) is a
key starting point for Dutch security
policy. Under Article 5, in the event of
an armed attack against a NATO
member in Europe or North America,
each of the other NATO members
must forthwith take, individually and
in concert, such action as it deems
necessary, including the use of armed
force, to restore and maintain the
security of the North Atlantic area.
The Treaty of Lisbon (2009) on the
functioning of the EU also imposes a
mutual assistance obligation on EU
Member States. This states, for those
EU Member States which are also
members of NATO, that NATO is the
basis for the collective defence of its
members and the instrument for the
execution of that collective defence.
The Treaty further states that the
Union has a common security and
defence policy (CSDP).

##### Appendix II
## The measures


**People**


requirements, to prevent unnecessary
drop out.

**» We will shorten waiting times so that**
people, including reservists, can start
working for the Ministry of Defence
sooner.

**» We will ask all military personnel**
leaving the organisation to become
a reservist.

**» We will establish a dedicated**
“reservist desk” to make it easier for
interested persons and employers.

**» Inspired by the “school of the nation”**
concept, we are undertaking efforts to
conclude a social agreement with
other government organisations and
the business community to jointly
guarantee training and career
opportunities for people (for positions that are scarce). In this context,
we are developing new concepts
regarding work and careers. In
partnership, we are also studying
options with respect to the
reintegration of our people.

**» We will make it possible for young**
people to complete a community
work placement programme in the
Defence organisation.

**» We will ensure that our people have a**
working environment that is as safe
as possible by heavily investing in
organisational learning ability
(including internal audits and incident
investigations), the safety culture, the
safety structure, capacity and
supervision. We will send you a plan
of action that specifies the measures
that will be taken in this regard.

**» We will ensure that the fundamen-**
tals are as they should be in terms of
readiness, operational support and
the necessary replacement of
weapon systems.


**» We will implement all arrangements**
laid down in the agreement on terms
and conditions of employment,
including the transition to a more
future proof pension system for
military personnel.

**» We will provide individual career**
counselling that includes training.

**» We will create more work experience**
positions.

**» We will take a tailored approach when**
assisting military personnel who drop
out of initial training to secure a more
suitable position.

**» We will grant commanders more**
powers, also in relation to budget, so
that, within the existing budgetary
frameworks, they can meet their
personnel requirement as they see fit.

**» We will introduce new forms of**
employment to increase the range
available and develop new, more
flexible (part-time) forms of contract
that more closely match the needs of
our personnel.

**» We will make it possible for**
employees to leave the organisation
temporarily.

**» We will encourage (temporary)**
exchange with other organisations.

**» We will make it possible for employ-**
ees to remain in a specific position for
longer.

**» We will modify the personnel system**
(FPS) as soon as possible to recruit
and retain the employees required by
the organisation.

**» We will introduce retention bonuses**
for military personnel in FPS phase 2.

**» We will encourage the voluntary**
departure of military personnel in FPS
phase 3 so that more opportunities
for progression become available for
people in phase 1 and phase 2.

**» We will improve and simplify the**
allowances system, with specific focus
on allowances, also for the Royal
Marechaussee, that are linked to
absences from home.


**» We will increase the current compen-**
sation arrangement for the state
pension shortfall from 90% to 100%.

**» Our people will have high-quality**
equipment and will have more
opportunities to participate in
exercises and training as a result of
the investments in operational
(combat) support.

**» We will improve healthcare, specifi-**
cally in terms of ICT and the modernisation of equipment.

**» Working for the Defence organisation**
can be highly demanding for our
personnel. We will keep providing the
right support, for example through
the Spiritual Welfare Service.

**» The availability of wireless internet**
will be improved at all Defence
accommodation sites to facilitate
contact with the home front. Office IT
will also be modernised to make the
performance of work less dependent
on time and place.

**» We will set up a national “debt of**
honour” fund (Nationaal Fonds
_Ereschulden) for members of the_
military who have sustained a
disability, trauma or other illness or
injury during a mission abroad.
We will take responsibility for our
current and former employees who
have work related health problems.

**» We are supporting the initiative to**
host the Invictus Games in The Hague
in 2020.

**» We will raise the organisation’s profile**
by organising our recruitment
activities at the regional level as well.

**» Military personnel may again travel**
in uniform.

**» We will work to make the organisati-**
on more diverse in terms of its human
capital by broadening the appeal of
our recruitment effort.

**» We will improve the selection and**
assessment process, as well as the
acceptance and educational entry


-----

**Means**


**» For the F-35, we will purchase**
systems that counter air-to-air and
surface to air threats. We will also
purchase medium-range and
long-range missile systems.

**» We will replace the C-130 (transport**
aircraft), the air to air refuelling
capability (KDC-10) and the air
transport capability (multi-role tanker
transport aircraft, or MRTT). The
MRTT aircraft will be purchased in
partnership with Belgium, Germany,
Luxembourg and Norway. It will also
be possible to deploy these aircraft
for the provision of humanitarian
emergency assistance and (medical)
evacuations.

**» Under the responsibility of the**
Ministry of Justice and Security, we
will form a Royal Netherlands
Marechaussee Passenger
Information Unit. This unit will be
tasked with inspecting airline
passenger data for the prevention,
detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and
serious crime. We will thus be
implementing the relevant EU
directive.

**» On the basis of earlier decisions,**
Royal Netherlands Marechaussee
capacity will be increased for border
control and the management of
migration flows.

**» The following Ministry of Defence**
sites in the Netherlands will remain
open: Brasserskade Complex in The
Hague, the ammunition complex in
Alphen, Korporaal van
_Oudheusdenkazerne in Hilversum, Joost_
_Dourleinkazerne on Texel, Kamp Nieuw_
_Milligen in Uddel and Koningin_
Wilhelminakazerne in Ossendrecht.
We are also considering the future of
a number of other sites.


**» We will increase our cyber capabili-**
ties to ensure that the Netherlands is
better protected against digital
threats. This objective is also stated
in the integrated foreign and security
strategy.

**» We will modernise the Defence cyber**
strategy in association with the
National Cyber Security Research
Agenda (NCSRA).

**» We will link sensors and information**
systems in a network to enhance our
ability to operate on an informationdriven basis. In this context, we will
also invest in our IT infrastructure
and intelligence, informationgathering and analysis capabilities
and the Defence Intelligence and
Security Service.

**» Based on a NATO concept, we are**
working with partners (Germany and
other countries) to improve our joint
information-driven capability.

**» We are working with Belgium to**
replace the multipurpose frigates.

**» The air defence and command**
frigates are currently undergoing a
modernisation programme.
Regarding the replacement of these
frigates, a statement of requirements
will be issued in a few years.

**» We are also working with Belgium to**
replace the current mine countermeasures capability. We are working
on an innovative concept of mother
platforms and unmanned mine
countermeasures systems. The
development of this concept is one
of the PESCO projects in which we
are participating.

**» The current submarines will be**
replaced by manned submarine
capability. A study carried out by the
Netherlands Organisation for Applied
Scientific Research (TNO) has shown
that variants other than manned
submarines cannot meet the
requirements (and are very expensive). The variants referred to will
therefore not be developed further in
the DMP B phase. The DMP B letter


regarding this matter will be sent
this year.

**» We will increase the deployability of**
fighter aircraft and helicopters.

**» We will modernise our weapon**
systems (midlife updates), such as
the Bushmaster (all wheel drive
armoured vehicle), Fennek (armoured reconnaissance vehicle), self
propelled howitzer, CV90 (infantry
fighting vehicle), short-range air
defence system (on land), landing
transport dock (LPD) and hydrographic survey vessels. We will also
modernise the electronic simulation
system for land operations, the
surface to surface missiles and the air
defence missiles (Evolved Sea
Sparrow Missile) on frigates, the
guns on the air defence and command frigates, the Goalkeeper
close-in weapon system (CIWS) on all
surface vessels, the Apache (attack
helicopter) and the Chinook (transport helicopter). Furthermore, three
Chinooks will be added to the current
fleet.

**» A small unit is experimenting with**
unmanned systems in land
operations.

**» We will increase ammunition and**
other deployment stocks.

**» We will increase the capacity of the**
Defence Explosive Ordnance
Disposal Service.

**» We will strengthen defences against**
chemical, biological, radiological and
nuclear (CBRN) threats. The Fuchs
reconnaissance vehicles equipped for
CBRN detection will be replaced.
Moreover, a system will be introduced that will make is possible for a
mobile hospital to function in an
area affected by CBRN
contamination.

**» We will replace the personal**
equipment of military personnel,
including the tactical vests and
ballistic protection gear. All handguns will also be gradually
modernised.


-----

**Methods**


» We will draw up an innovation
strategy this year. To accelerate and
strengthen our own innovation, we
will look for new partners.
Partnerships may be formed with
start-ups, for example, and we will
also look at innovative forms of
cooperation, such as field labs at
which ideas are developed, tested
and implemented.
» We will invest in acquiring and
developing knowledge with respect
to the cyber domain, information-driven operations, strike capabilities on land, at sea and in the air, and
new technologies such as artificial
intelligence, robotics, 3D printing,
biotechnology and nanotechnology.
» We will include a fixed range in the
investment plan for the acquisition
and development of knowledge,
defence-specific research, technological development and innovation.

» We will scrutinise internal regulations
and processes.
» We will grant more powers to
commanders and units regarding
deployment, personnel, materiel and
funds. This change will require
different working relationships.


**» Together with the Ministry of Justice**
and Security, we are reviewing civil
military cooperation. With other
security partners, we are developing
as comprehensive an overview as
possible of relevant civil and military
capabilities for national crisis
management and the provision of
support in disaster relief.
» Together with the Ministry of Justice
and Security and a number of
companies, we are working to
identify the kind of assistance that
would be required to protect vital
infrastructure and ensure digital
security in the event of an
emergency.
» We will improve the coordination
and management of Host Nation
Support. Together with the Ministry
of Justice and Security and the
security regions, we are studying
ways in which a new civil-military
partnership could contribute to this
improvement. It is important for us
to be capable of providing the
support and security required if our
allies need to transport their units
and equipment via the Netherlands.
» We will undertake efforts to simplify
the cross-border transport of military
capabilities within Europe (military
mobility).

» We will form a conflict prevention
unit that will serve as the coordinator
of foreign defence efforts aimed at
preventing conflict and as the point
of contact for partners in the
Netherlands and abroad.
» We will increase the number of
international military positions to
make it possible to contribute to the
expansion of NATO’s command
structure.
» We will strengthen our leading role in
international cooperation by
cooperating more closely with our
strategic partners.


» With a number of strategic partners,
we have placed seven procurement
projects under PESCO. These projects
concern logistics, medical capabilities, maritime mine countermeasures, the cyber domain and radio
communication.
» We are actively cooperating in the EU
planning process, the Coordinated
Annual Review on Defence (CARD),
to more rapidly identify and make
use of opportunities to cooperate
and jointly develop capabilities.
» Once the defence development
programme of the European Defence
Fund is operational, we will participate in various projects.

» We will press for a more open
European defence market with a
level playing field. In the case of
tendering processes, we will
interpret Article 346 of the Treaty of
Lisbon (Treaty on the Functioning of
the European Union) broadly and
thereby take the security interests of
the Netherlands into account.
» With regard to procurement, we will
operate on the principles of ”fast,
unless” and ”off the shelf, unless”.
This will of course apply to proven
technology.
» Where possible, we will leave the
procurement of non-defence-specific
items and services to external parties.

» In cooperation with the Ministry of
Economic Affairs and Climate Policy,
we want to be the launch customer
more frequently in order to stimulate
innovation and give companies a
good chance of succeeding in the
market.
» We will update the defence industry
strategy this year. The strategy will
explain how, in cooperation with the
Ministry of Economic Affairs and
Climate Policy, we will stimulate
innovation in the context of the Top
Sectors policy and provide a foundation for strengthening cooperation
with the business community.
