#### Defence Industrial Strategy Defence White Paper

###### Presented to Parliament by The Secretary of State for Defence By Command of Her Majesty

 December 2005

 £18.00


###### Cm 6697


-----

###### Foreword


he country is rightly proud of its Armed Forces, and recognizes the vital contribution they make to ensuring our
security in an uncertain world. Since the Strategic Defence Review in 1998, and through successive White Papers,
we have been transforming the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force to face the demands of the 21st Century. Our

# T

plans provide for agile, fl exible forces that can respond effectively to the varied challenges and opportunities we face now
and in the future.

That realignment is supported by a substantial equipment programme, reconfi guring our forces to project power round the
world to protect UK interests and strengthen international peace and stability. This has been supported by sustained real
increases in the Defence budget arising from each Spending Review since the Government was elected in 1997.

Our Defence Industrial Strategy takes forward our Defence Industrial Policy, published in 2002, by providing greater
transparency of our future defence requirements and, for the fi rst time, setting out those industrial capabilities we need in
the UK to ensure that we can continue to operate our equipment in the way we choose.

The Defence Industrial Strategy recognises the important contribution that our defence industry makes to delivering
military capability and the clarity provided in the strategy will, we believe, promote a dynamic, sustainable and globally
competitive defence manufacturing sector. The UK market for defence equipment and services is the second largest in the
world, and we recognise that the UK has a broad-based and sophisticated defence industry. The UK offers unique attractions
to business and we continue to benefi t from the presence in our market of companies, whoever their shareholders are, who
are prepared to invest and develop their businesses here.

But Government is clear that there are also challenges ahead. The complex, technologically challenging and high-value
systems which we are introducing – and which take many years to design and bring into service – will last for many years. This
places increasing emphasis on an ability to support and upgrade them through life, as well as having implications for the level
of industrial capability and capacity that it is sensible or economic for industry to retain. We recognize that industry will have
to reshape itself, to improve productivity and to adjust to lower production levels once current major equipment projects have
been completed, while at the same time retaining the specialist skills and systems engineering capabilities required to manage
military capability on a through life basis. Just as the roles and structures of the Armed Forces are transforming, so too are
those of the defence industry which has itself to face the future with confi dence.

In this Strategy, we consider carefully which industrial capabilities we need to retain in the UK to ensure that we can continue
to operate our equipment in the way we choose to maintain appropriate sovereignty and thereby protect our national security.
The Strategy sets these out, and explains clearly for the fi rst time which industrial capabilities we require to be sustained
onshore, noting that – as now – there are many that we can continue to seek to satisfy through open international competition.
In doing so, it builds upon the Defence Industrial Policy, explains more clearly how procurement decisions are made, and to
assist industry in planning for the future commits the Government to greater transparency of our forward plans, noting that as
in any business, these change over time as spending priorities shift or cost estimates mature.

To implement this strategy will require changes on behalf of both industry and Government. Industry will need to adjust to sustain
the capabilities we need once current production peaks are passed. The Government, too, needs to drive forward improvements
in the way we acquire, support and upgrade our equipment. Together, the defence industry and government have to change their
relationship, working to ensure that our Armed Forces continue to have the equipment they need. Doing this will help ensure
the UK defence industry has a sustainable and bright future. This will require continuous effort on both sides over the coming
years as it will not be easy. However, by starting the process today, while workloads are high, we can avoid facing a crisis in a
few years time. We recognize some companies will fi nd the strategy’s conclusions diffi cult, but believe that industry, the City, the
government and the country needs the additional clarity we are offering, to help industry reshape itself for the future.

We will look to the National Defence Industries Council to monitor our joint progress, and will review this Strategy every
Spending Review period. In the meantime, and as the basis for the detailed implementation which will follow over the next
few months, we commend this Strategy to you.

###### Executive Summary


i. The Defence Industrial Strategy (DIS) is structured in three parts: Part
A, providing the strategic context; Part B, reviewing diff erent industrial sectors
and cross-cutting industrial capabilities; and Part C, outlining the implications
for MOD and industry as a whole, and how the DIS will be implemented.

###### Part A – Strategic Overview

ii. The global security environment in which the Armed Forces operate
has changed substantially over the past fi fteen years. Facing new and complex
challenges, the roles, size and shape of Armed Forces have also changed.
In parallel, the defence industry has evolved; defence companies are now
often transnational, needing to attract and retain investors in international
markets – forcing increased effi ciency, restructuring and rationalisation.
We are now reaching a crossroads.

iii. Although we are in the middle of a substantial transformation,
involving a series of major new platforms (including the future aircraft
carriers, Type 45 Destroyers, new medium-weight armoured fi ghting
vehicles, and the A400M, Typhoon and Joint Combat Aircraft), we expect
these platforms to have very long service lives. This means the future
business for the defence industry in many sectors will be in supporting
and upgrading these platforms, rapidly inserting technology to meet
emerging threats, fulfi l new requirements and respond to innovative
opportunities, not immediately moving to design the next generation.

iv. In parallel, industrial rationalisation continues, and
sustaining competition to meet domestic requirements is increasingly
diffi cult. In several sectors, following the entry into service of
major projects, there will be substantial overcapacity in production
facilities in the UK defence industry in a few years’ time.

v. As we look to non-British sources of supply, whether at the prime or
subsystems level, we need to continue to recognise the extent to which this
may constrain the choices we can make about how we use our Armed Forces
– in other words, how we maintain our sovereignty and national security.

vi. Companies now have more choice than ever before about which
markets to enter, which secure the best return for shareholders, and where to
base their operations. If we do not make clear which industrial capabilities we
need to have onshore (and this includes those maintained by foreign-owned
defence companies), industry will make independent decisions and indigenous
capability which is required to maintain our national security may disappear.

vii. Equally, we do not seek to restrict the scope for international
cooperation and competition where this is appropriate, and we cannot
aff ord to maintain a complete cradle-to-grave industrial base in all areas.
As industry has told us, greater clarity is therefore needed urgently on
which capabilities must be retained onshore, and which by implication can
be met from a wider market. The DIS does not seek to set out a preferred
route to international restructuring; that is very much industry’s business.
But it does seek to create a clear UK context to inform these decisions.


###### Executive Summary


**Our aim in the DIS**

viii. For these reasons, we need to consider how best the MOD should
seek to engage with the industrial base in order to meet our requirements.
The DIS fl ows from the wider Defence Industrial Policy (2002), and is ‘driven
by the need to provide the Armed Forces with the equipment which they
require, on time, and at best value for money for the taxpayer.’ The DIS is thus
one of many contributions to the wider aim of ensuring that the capability
requirements of the Armed Forces can be met, now and in the future.

ix. The DIS will promote a sustainable industrial base, that retains
in the UK those industrial capabilities needed to ensure national security.
Our interaction with this industrial base must provide good value to the
taxpayer and good returns to shareholders based on delivery of good
performance, consistent with broader security and economic policy.

x. To deliver this, the DIS:

gives a strategic view of defence capability requirements going
forward (including new projects, but also the support and upgrade
of equipment already in service), by sector. Part of the strategic
view is specifying, in order to meet these, which industrial
capabilities we would wish to see retained in the UK for Defence
reasons. We aim to communicate the overall view to industry
as clearly as possible, recognising that plans change as the
strategic or fi nancial environment evolves (and the DIS explains
our current internal planning process, to allow industry to make
informed judgements about how to interpret this information);

gives further detail on the principles and processes that
underpin procurement and industrial decisions;

where there is a mismatch between the level of activity our
own plans (and export/civil opportunities) would support and
that required to sustain desired industrial capabilities onshore,
investigates how we might with industry address that gap.

**The evolving market and the UK business environment**

xi. We recognise that in the UK we have a successful and
sophisticated industrial base with a broad range of capabilities
and which delivers a large proportion of our defence equipment
and services. We welcome overseas investment where this creates
value, employment, technology or intellectual assets in the UK.

xii We also recognise the attractions of the US market, given its scale
and high levels of investment in research and technology, and that the level of
infl uence and attractiveness of MOD business varies by sector and by type of
company. But the UK provides a unique environment for the defence industry:

a greater proportion of our overall business is available
to industry than in any other major defence nation,
and growing expertise in the combination of systems
engineering skills, agility and supply chain management
required to deliver through-life capability management
i h UK d f i d i d


-----

we have a sophisticated demand for high-value products
which have to stand up to active service, and consequently,
are easier to market to export customers;

we have an open market and diversity of suppliers which
encourages innovation, new entrants and inward investment;

and profi t potential and a trading environment which is open to new
procurement models, including long-term partnering arrangements,
which incentivise industry to drive down costs but allow increased
profi ts where these are earned by improved performance;

in addition, the Government helps sustain an attractive
overall business environment, including:

a stable macro-economic and political environment;
leadership in science & technology, including
by targeted MOD investment;

low costs;
Strong support industries in fi nance, business
services, design and marketing;

a highly skilled and fl exible labour force;
a transparent business environment that
encourages fair competition;
specifi c support to the Defence industry, including
the Defence Export Services Organisation.

xiii. We also recognise that the bedrock of our procurement policy
has to be long-term value for money. Competition is often a useful
mechanism to establish this, but is not always appropriate, and needs to
be used intelligently, alongside other models, considering the nature of the
marketplace. The UK has increasing experience of new approaches which
may apply in diff erent circumstances, and by setting out how we approach
diff erent situations, and the various tools available, we hope in future to
speed the decision-making process signifi cantly, and pick the right tool
from the toolbox fi rst time. We also recognise the need to improve the
earned profi t margins available to industry based on good performance if
we are to attract global investment capital into the UK defence industry.

xiv. The priority for the DIS is in ensuring that UK industry can meet the
requirements of the Armed Forces, both now and in the future. Wider
factors, as set out in Chapter A9, will continue to be considered in acquisition
decisions. The key to ensuring that a chosen procurement strategy is most
suited to the circumstances of a particular project is to expose the wider
factors which impinge upon that project at the earliest opportunity, engaging
relevant Government stakeholders from the outset in order to do so.

**Identifying and sustaining Key Industrial Capabilities**

xiv. Every nation ideally wants to keep under its control critical defence
technologies, but no country outside the US can aff ord to have a full cradle
to grave industry in every sector, and our Armed Forces continue to benefi t
from the extensive range of foreign-sourced equipment currently in service.
And it is readily recognised that much of the equipment procured from
UK prime contractors contains non UK sourced content. We welcome the
progress made in establishing understandings on security of supply and
the decision to introduce an EU Code of Conduct on Defence Procurement
which aims to create an eff ective European Defence Equipment Market. We
continue to welcome overseas products, and indeed in many signifi cant
areas rely on overseas supply, with appropriate guarantees (which may
include technology access to ensure we can adapt equipment to meet
national requirements over time) and/or judgement that any increased
risk to maintaining our operational independence is acceptable.

xv.The UK also retains a sizeable, open and broadly-based defence industry
which delivers a large proportion of MOD’s needs, and we welcome overseas
i i ll f i h l l


technology or intellectual assets in the UK and thus become part of the UK
defence industry. Within this strategy, we aim to tell industry very clearly
where, to maintain our national security and keep the sovereign ability to
use our Armed Forces in the way we choose, we need particular industrial
capabilities in the UK (which does not preclude them being owned or
established by foreign-owned companies). We have therefore assessed
industrial capabilities against national security priorities, broken down into:

strategic assurance (capabilities which are to be retained
onshore as they provide technologies or equipment
important to safeguard the state, e.g. nuclear deterrent);

defence capability (where we require particular assurance
of continued and consistent equipment performance);
and strategic infl uence (in military, diplomatic or industrial
terms), as well as recognising potential technology benefi ts
attached to these which have wider value. But as the DIS
makes clear, even where we wish an industrial capability to be
sustained in the UK for strategic reasons, that does not necessarily
preclude global competition in that sector for some projects.

###### PART B – Review by Industrial Sector and Cross-cutting Capabilities

**B1. System Engineering**

xvi. Given that the new platforms being brought into service are
likely to remain in our inventory for many years, and are increasingly
complex, it is little use investing in cutting-edge science unless systems
engineering capability and vital long-term knowledge is maintained.
New technologies will have less benefi t if the knowledge of how they
might best be exploited and inserted into existing equipment has been
lost. This demands a high level of systems engineering skills, at all levels
of the supply chain (recognising that much of a platform’s capability is
delivered through its subsystems, which will often be the route to upgrading
capability), sustained through the life of the equipment. The signifi cance
of this capability varies by sector, but it is generally very important
for maintaining our control of how we operate our Armed Forces.

**B2. Maritime**

xvii. We require versatile maritime expeditionary forces, able to project
power across the globe in support of British interests and delivering eff ect
on to land at a time and place of our choosing. To sustain this capability:

it is a high priority for the UK to retain the suite of capabilities
required to design complex ships and submarines, from
concept to point of build; and the complementary skills to
manage the build, integration, assurance, test, acceptance,
support and upgrade of maritime platforms through-life;

For the foreseeable future the UK will retain all of those capabilities
unique to submarines and their Nuclear Steam Raising Plant, to
enable their design, development, build, support, operation and
decommissioning. MOD and industry must demonstrate an ability to
drive down and control the costs of nuclear submarine programmes;

We also need to retain the ability to maintain and support the Navy.

There are a number of specifi c key maritime system capabilities
and technologies which we should retain onshore, and the
ability to develop and integrate into platforms complex
i i b i l hi h i i


-----

xviii. In the past, we have specifi ed that all warship hulls should be built
onshore. However, the national security requirement surrounds the ability to
upgrade rapidly, integrate highly complex and sensitive subsystems, and launch
operations from the UK base. To sustain this requires a minimum ability to build
as well as integrate complex ships in the UK, not least to develop the workforce,
and to adjust fi rst-of-class designs as they develop. At issue is the capacity
required. The Future Aircraft Carrier, Type 45 Destroyer and Astute projects will
keep the UK shipbuilding industry fully employed for some years (and it may not
have the fabrication capacity to absorb the full programme at its peak), but from
around 2016, the steady-state demand will be signifi cantly lower. The business
must be streamlined for greater effi ciency and profi tability. The clear trend is
for fewer more capable platforms, able to incorporate upgrades as necessary
to respond to new technologies and threats. The ability to do so will depend
upon us working together with industry to address the fundamental issues
of aff ordability and productivity. The industry, which is currently fragmented,
needs to consolidate and refocus around a core workload which sustains key
capabilities and represents a viable business. Provided our key capabilities are
maintained, not all of them must be exercised onshore for every project, and
the strategic need for onshore execution will be judged on a case by case basis.

xix. We will immediately start negotiations with the key submarine
companies with the aim of achieving a programme-level partnering agreement
with a single industrial entity for the full life cycle of the submarine fl otilla,
addressing key aff ordability issues. The aim is to achieve this agreement in time
for award of the fourth and subsequent Astute Class submarines. For Surface
Ship Design & Build, within the next six months, we aim to have reached a
common understanding of the core load required to sustain the high-end
design, systems engineering and combat systems integration skills that we have
identifi ed as being important. We expect industry to begin restructuring itself
around the emerging analysis to improve its performance, and shall build on the
momentum generated by the industrial arrangements being put together on
the CVF programme to drive restructuring to meet both the CVF peak and the
reduced post-CVF demand. For surface ship support, we will start immediate
negotiations with the industry with the aim of exploring alternative contracting
arrangements and the way ahead for the next upkeep periods, which start
in the autumn of 2006. Key Maritime Equipment industrial capabilities will
be supported by the production of a sustainability strategy by June 2006.

**B3. Armoured Fighting Vehicles (AFVs)**

xx. The AFV fl eet is key to the Land Forces’ military eff ectiveness. There
are compelling advantages to retaining a UK industrial AFV capability to
maintain and upgrade the capability of current and future equipment. We
seek to maintain in the UK AFV Systems Engineering, Domain and Design
Knowledge for though life capability management, including the ability to act
as an intelligent customer for the design, development and manufacture of
new AFVs and their integration into networks. We also need the intellectual
ability to design, validate and interpret the results of AFV testing, though
most test and evaluation facilities do not necessarily have to be on-shore.
We also wish the UK defence industry to be able to design, build and
integrate onto the platform AFVs’ critical subsystems, including electronic
architecture, sensors and integrated survivability solutions. We also need to
be able to repair and overhaul AFVs onshore, and we need the industry to be
able to respond quickly, including through deployed support on operations.
For future projects, we need industry to deliver the complex system of
systems that will make up the Future Rapid Eff ects System (FRES) fl eet.

xxi. It is questionable whether any single company has the ability or
expertise to provide all elements of the FRES capability cost-eff ectively.
The most likely solution will be a team, led by a systems integrator with
the highest levels of systems engineering, skills, resources and capabilities
based in the UK, in which national and international companies cooperate
d li h FRES l f i l di h i d b


xxii. The UK AFV industry has consolidated so that BAE Systems Land
Systems (LS) is the supplier of 95% of our current inventory. We need to
manage this in-service fl eet through life whilst still retaining access to best
of market products at subsystem level. Building on discussions already set
in train, we will work hard with the company to give eff ect to the long-term
partnering arrangement required to improve the reliability, availability and
eff ectiveness through-life of our existing AFV fl eets. We intend to establish
a joint team early in 2006 to establish a business transformation plan
underpinned by a robust milestone and performance regime. We expect to
see a signifi cant evolution of BAE Systems Land Systems both to deliver AFV
availability and upgrades through life, and to bring advanced land systems’
technologies, skills and processes into the UK. If successful in their evolution,
BAE Systems will be well placed for the forthcoming FRES programme.

**B4. Fixed wing**

xxiii. Air power continues to off er the ability to transform the
battlespace, utilising its inherent attributes of reach and speed to enable
strategic operational and tactical agility. We are introducing two new,
highly sophisticated manned combat fast jets, Typhoon and the Joint
Combat Aircraft, which are intended to last for more than 30 years.
Current plans do not envisage the UK needing to design and build a future
generation of manned fast jet aircraft beyond these types. However,
precisely because the current fl eet and the new types we are introducing
are likely to have such long operational lives, we need to retain the
ability to maintain and upgrade these types for a considerable period.

xxiii. The focus must shift to through-life support and upgrade and
what is required to sustain this critical capability in the absence of largescale manufacture. MOD has been working closely with BAE Systems, as the
UK’s only supplier of fast jets, for some time to understand these mutual
challenges, which are likely to impact on the UK industrial footprint, in
particular around BAE Air Systems’ four main production sites. We intend
to continue to work together to explore how a long term partnering
arrangement for the through-life availability of a signifi cant proportion
of the fi xed-wing fl eet might be delivered to sustain these capabilities
and deliver improved value for money. We aim on working during 2006
to develop the solution – which will be challenging given the scale of
the transformation that is required – and to implement it from 2007.

xxiv. We and industry share a close alignment of interest in UAV
and UCAV technology. Although at present we have no funded UCAV
programme, targeted investment in UCAV technology demonstrator
programmes would help sustain the very aerospace engineering and design
capabilities we will need to operate and support our future aircraft fl eet.
Such investment would also ensure that we can make better informed
decisions which will need to be taken around 2010-2015 on the future
mix of manned and unmanned aircraft. Additionally, UK industry will have
the opportunity to develop a competitive edge in a potentially lucrative
military and civil market. We intend to move forward with a substantial
joint Technology Demonstrator Programme in this area. We hope that
appropriate arrangements will be in place to allow this to proceed in 2006.

xxv. Our plans to retain onshore the industrial capabilities required
to ensure eff ective through-life support to the existing and planned
fast jet fl eet – and to invest in developing UCAV technology – will
also provide us with the core industrial skills required to contribute
to any future international manned fast jet programme, should the
requirement for one emerge. This recognises both the uncertainty of
our very long term requirements – with the possibility that we shall
want to replace elements of the Typhoon and Joint Strike Fight fl eets
with manned aircraft – and that we should avoid continuing to fund
i d i l bili i f hi h h id ifi d i


-----

xxvi. Critical mission systems, including electro-optical (EO)
sensors, radar, Electronic Support Measures (ESM) and Defensive
Aids Systems (DAS) are also signifi cant areas where we wish to retain
onshore capability and where suppliers must be able to work with the
prime contractor and be rewarded for developing new solutions.

xxvii. Our need to retain a minimum level of onshore capability does
not necessarily mean that we will need to support all aspects of our aircraft
in the UK. For Typhoon, we will work with our partners to create a better
and more effi cient business model for the aircraft’s support and upgrades,
ensuring that we retain onshore our ability to satisfy our sovereign
requirements over its lifetime. Clearly, BAE Systems, and, for the engines
and mission systems respectively, Rolls-Royce, Smiths Aerospace and Selex
Sensors and Airborne Systems will have a signifi cant role to play in this..

xxviii. For the Joint Strike Fighter, the through-life support of the UK
aircraft will be provided from the Lockheed Martin Global Support System
which is being established on a co-operative basis amongst the nine JSF
partner nations. As part of this performance based arrangement, the
UK also intends to establish sovereign support capabilities which would
provide, in country facilities to maintain, repair and upgrade the UK fl eet
and an Integrated Pilot and Maintainer Training Centre. Our aim is that
BAE Systems as a key JSF Industry partner to Lockheed Martin will provide
these support services in the UK under a Team JSF badge. There is no
fundamental defence requirement for a JSF Final Assembly and Check Out
(FACO) facility, although an ongoing joint study between MOD, DTI and
BAE Systems, due to conclude in early 2006, is seeking to assess whether
a UK FACO is necessary to preserve essential engineering skills within
BAE Systems and would be a cost eff ective and aff ordable solution.

xxix. There is no sovereign requirement to sustain an indigenous
capability in large and training aircraft. We will continue to
need, however, the systems engineering and design skills and
Intellectual Property Rights for the integration of new mission
systems, avionics and defensive aids into these platforms.

**B5. Helicopters**

xxx. Helicopters are inherently responsive, adaptable and fl exible,
and contribute to a variety of military tasks. They can operate in a
very wide range of combat and environmental conditions, and will
often be an essential part of a balanced expeditionary force.

xxxi. The helicopter sector has similar characteristics to the
AFV sector – a high concentration of knowledge relating to the
existing fl eet, but a healthy international competitive environment.
AgustaWestland’s systems engineering capability needs sustainment
to maintain our ability to support and upgrade the current fl eet.

xxxii. Our preferred solution is to invest in the Future Lynx product,
currently undergoing detailed capability and value for money assessment,
to meet our Battlefi eld Reconnaissance and Surface Combatant Maritime
Helicopter requirements and sustain the necessary Design Authority
capability at the company in the short to medium-term. We intend to
promote a more open, predictable but demanding partnered relationship
with the company, to provide better value for money and reduce their
reliance on our investment to sustain the design engineering skill-base,
and accordingly intend to fi nalise a Strategic Partnering Agreement
with AgustaWestland by Spring 2006. We will continue to look to
the vibrant and competitive global marketplace to satisfy our future
helicopter requirements (including for support). We also wish to keep
diff erent levels of capability onshore in rotorblades, mission systems,
i bili ib i d l i hi


**B6. General munitions**

xxxiii. Recent operations have clearly demonstrated that despite the
increases in technology, modern warfare, particularly on the ground,
requires highly trained and motivated service personnel to engage in
combat at a very personal level. It is in such engagements that quality
general munitions are essential to provide the volumes of fi re and the 24
hour, all weather capability required to suppress, neutralise and demoralise
enemy forces. It is essential that we retain onshore the Design Authority
(DA) role and its underpinning capability for munitions manufactured.
We also require the ability to develop munitions for specifi c purposes to
match our doctrine, and maintain an intelligent customer capability for
non-UK designed munitions. A robust through-life management capability
onshore is vital. It is also essential that we retain a proof and surveillance
capability onshore for UK designed munitions as well as at least a minimum
munitions disposals capability. We should also retain onshore the UK’s
insensitive munitions and related energetic materials capability, which
are world-class. But we do not consider it necessary to retain all aspects of
bulk explosives manufacture in UK and would be prepared to source small
arms ammunition off shore if security of supply could be guaranteed; it is
presently questionable given potential undercapacity in global supply.

xxxiv. In this sector, BAE Systems has the majority of the existing business,
but there remain niche capabilities abroad and elsewhere in the UK which
may meet future needs. We have therefore adopted a partnership with
BAE Systems and are considering ways in which we can rationalise the
through-life management of munitions, without ruling out the prospect
of global competition for future projects at this stage. We also have
partnering agreements with other suppliers (Rheinmettall and Wallop
Defence Systems) in niche areas. We will reach further conclusions on how
best to sustain our required access to general munitions in summer 2006.

**B7. Complex weapons**

xxxv. Complex Weapons provide our Armed Forces with battle winning
precision eff ects. The UK is making a signifi cant investment in the upgrade
and development of complex weapons, which peaks at just over £1BN next
year and will reduce by some 40% over the next fi ve years following the
delivery of Storm Shadow and Brimstone. There is, apart from the Meteor
programme, little signifi cant planned design and development work beyond
the next two years. This will present a substantial challenge to the industry.

xxxvi. There are some types of complex weapon that we have bought
from overseas in the past, and we would be prepared to source future
torpedoes from abroad provided we retain the capability to support
the current inventory, write tactical software, and design and integrate
homing heads. However, we would wish to maintain the ability to design,
develop, assemble, support and upgrade other complex weapons, which
is a complex task requiring a number of critical and sensitive underpinning
capabilities. We also see the potential of Directed Energy Weapons.

xxxvii. The fragility of the wider UK industrial base is such that open
international competition could put the sustainment of key industrial
capabilities at risk. We intend to work with all elements of the onshore
industry over the next six to twelve months to establish whether – and if so
how – we can achieve a sustainable industry that meets our requirements in
a value for money fashion. There is potential for industrial rationalisation and
consolidation and we will need to work with other European governments to
identify whether a coordinated approach to sustain a viable industrial base
is possible. But this will not be to the exclusion of US-owned companies,
in particular those who have established a fi rm foothold in the UK.


-----

**B8. Command, Control, Communication and**
**Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Target**
**Acquisition and Reconnaissance (C4ISTAR)**

xxxviii. This is a very signifi cant area where we assume sustained
expenditure. It will be the C4ISTAR related capabilities that will help
underpin the overarching Network Enabled Capability essential to
the continued transformation of our capability, by providing the
technology to deliver agile, networked and informed Armed Forces.

xxxix. Much of the innovation is driven by the civil sector and
we are in general a relatively minor customer in a market where
the pace of technological change creates its own set of unique
pressures. To maintain national security, we need to maintain
in the UK specifi c industrial capabilities, including:

High grade cryptography and associated
information assurance capabilities;

A continued ability to understand, integrate,
assure and modify mission critical systems.

as well as intelligent customer status and a research and development
base supported by a manufacturing capability in specifi c areas.

xxxx. There are a number of healthy companies with the requisite
skills in the UK, and given civil opportunities in this sector and a large
number of planned projects, competition by project seems sustainable
for the foreseeable future. However, maintaining a cryptographic
capability currently requires a specifi c strategy to sustain an end-to-end
design, development and manufacturing capability. We are working
with other government departments to generate better coherence across
Government, and increase industry’s visibility of the total opportunities.

**B9. Chemical, Biological, Radiological,**
**and Nuclear Force Protection**

xxxxi. We are committed to maintaining the UK’s political and
military freedom of action despite the presence, threat or use of CBRN
weapons, and this is an area in which signifi cant increases in investment
are currently planned. We need the UK industrial base, which is a world
leader in this fi eld, to deliver intelligent supplier capabilities, systems
engineering, specifi c technology research, as well as the supply of certain
raw materials and the manufacture of medical countermeasures.

xxxxii. CBRN protection requirements have for some time been met
through a healthy competitive industrial market place. We will explore
however the potential costs and benefi ts of partnering, however,
particularly with the four main industrial players in the UK (Smiths
Detection, General Dynamics UK, Serco Assurance and EDS), to see
whether other acquisition models could allow us to achieve rapid
and innovative acquisition and achieve better value for money.

**B.10 Counter terrorism (CT)**

xxxxiii. Given the nature of the international terrorist threat, capabilities
previously needed in specialist areas and in Northern Ireland are increasingly
becoming required across the Armed Forces. This reinforces the importance
of the counter-terrorism sector, and provides greater opportunities for
both industry and MOD to become more cost-eff ective in the CT fi eld.

xxxxiv. Although there are aspects of the technology base within the
d l f d i f CT h d


be retained within UK industry, it is primarily within the areas of systems
engineering (including design and development), testing and evaluation,
and system packaging that the MOD needs to be able to maintain critical
elements of its CT capability onshore. We believe there is no urgent
remedial action required to sustain these industrial capabilities.

**B.11 Technology priorities to**
**enable defence capability**

xxxxv. To support the industrial capabilities identifi ed across the sectoral
analysis there are a number of areas in which the UK must sustain existing
technological strengths or where we should, resources permitting, consider
developing our expertise. There are other technologies showing promise across
a range of defence applications that may have either a large impact on specifi c
defence capabilities or a more widespread impact across many aspects of
defence. These are provisionally identifi ed in the DIS, but we recognise we will
need further work in 2006 to inform our research and technology priorities.

**B.12 Test & evaluation (T&E)**

xxxxvi. T&E is vital to the development, introduction into service
and through-life support of the equipment used by our Armed Forces.
It contributes to a variety of activities which reduce risk to our Armed
Forces. We use a mixture of in-house, Government Owned Contractor
Operated (GoCo) and commercial T&E facilities in the UK to support
the acquisition and sustainment of military capability. The majority of
MOD T&E sites operated on our behalf by QinetiQ under the Long Term
Partnering Agreement (LTPA). All these capabilities are kept under constant
review to ensure that they continue to meet our T&E requirements and
to identify potential rationalisation or effi ciency opportunities.

xxxxvii. In some cases a UK based T&E capability is essential for,
amongst other things, certain quality assurance, safety or operational
security needs and sovereignty of access. In other cases the important
element is to retain the ability to direct, understand, analyse and verify
T&E results rather than actually conduct testing on-shore, subject to
certain safeguards including security of supply. We will work with
industry to identify where such distinctions can be safely made. Our
current strategic intent in the medium term is to retain T&E capability
within the UK, but to look for overseas cooperation where appropriate.
Work in the European Defence Agency may lead, in due course, to a
longer-term strategy to consolidate T&E capabilities across Europe.

###### PART C: Implementing the Defence Industrial Strategy

xxxxviii. The DIS also presents real and fundamental challenges to the
Ministry of Defence. The strategy will not deliver unless the whole of the
defence acquisition community, including industry, are able to make the
necessary shifts in behaviours, organisations and business processes.

il. The basic principles of Smart Acquisition still hold true and are
a strong foundation from which to take forward the DIS. But our future
approach to acquisition must be built around achieving primacy of
through life considerations; coherence of defence spend across research
and development, procurement and support; and successful management
of acquisition at the departmental level. Our detailed implementation
plan has specifi c initiatives to address the objectives of achieving:

primacy of through-life considerations;
coherence of defence spread accross research,
development, procurement and support;
f l f i i i h D l l l


-----

l. The measures identifi ed under these headings are necessary
to improve our acquisition performance. But they may not be suffi cient.
We will appoint a senior offi cial to review our current acquisition
construct and recommend changes across the MOD’s business with
fi nal recommendations by May 2006 for early implementation.

li. We will be looking for parallel commitment
from industry in the following areas:

planning more eff ectively and jointly for the long term,
embracing the vision of through-life capability management
to meet our requirements cost-eff ectively;

investing in growing and maintaining a high-quality
systems engineering capability within the UK;

promoting greater interaction and collaboration between
MOD, prime contractors, SMEs and the universities to stimulate
innovation in science, technology and engineering;

encouraging trust, openness, transparency and
communication with MOD at all levels;

embracing open systems architecture principles and incremental
acquisition approaches throughout the supply chain;

working jointly to foster better understanding of each others’
objectives and business processes, including a greater commitment
to joint education, staff development and interchange opportunities.

lii. We will keep the progress of this work, and the extent to which
real change is being demonstrated on the ground, under review within
the MOD, through the Acquisition Policy Board reporting to the Minister
for Defence Procurement. We will want formally to review progress with
the National Defence Industries Council regularly. We will also review this
Strategy as a whole once every Comprehensive Spending Review period.

###### Introduction
### A1 A1


A1.1 The global security environment and the policy context in which
the Armed Forces operate has undergone substantial changes over the
past fi fteen years. No longer do we face an imminent and existential
threat from a hostile superpower; but in its place have developed new
and more complex challenges. The 1998 ‘Strategic Defence Review’ (SDR)
recognised the signifi cance of this strategic shift and established a clear
policy requirement for fl exible, expeditionary Armed Forces able to
undertake a wide range of tasks at distance from the UK. Since then we
have continued to review our implementation of this broad policy direction,
responding to rapid evolution of the strategic environment. This is evident
in the series of further policy papers including the 2002 ‘SDR New Chapter’,
the 2003 ‘Delivering Security in a Changing World’ White Paper and the
2004 ‘Future Capabilities’ Command Paper. These have driven continuous
change in the roles, doctrine, size and shape of our Armed Forces.

###### Introduction
### A1


A1.2 In parallel, the defence industry has evolved. The defence sector has
not been immune to the forces of globalisation and inter-dependence that
have characterised the wider world economy over the past thirty years. Far
from it: defence companies are now transnational, with the need to attract and
retain investors - forcing increased effi ciency, restructuring and rationalisation
and an increased focus on which markets secure best returns to shareholders.

A1.3 Nowhere is this more true than in the UK, which has for the past
fi fteen years operated one of the most open defence markets in the world.
Exposing UK defence suppliers to the rigours of competitive pressure has
reaped huge dividends: for the Armed Forces, in ensuring that they have
access to the best military hardware on off er; to the tax payer, in reducing
substantially the costs of meeting these requirements; and to UK industry
itself, which having been incentivised to increase productivity in the
domestic market has been so successful in winning business abroad.


A1.4 We have now reached a crossroads. We are seeing a shift away
from platform orientated programmes towards a capability-based
approach, with corresponding implications for the demand required
of the traditional defence industrial base. Although we are in the
middle of a substantial transformation, involving a series of major new
platforms (including the future Aircraft Carriers, Type 45 Destroyers, new
medium-weight armoured fi ghting vehicles, and the A400M, Typhoon
and Joint Strike Fighter) we expect these platforms to have very long
service lives. This means the future business for the defence industry
in many sectors will be in supporting and upgrading these platforms,
rapidly inserting new technology to meet emerging threats, fulfi l new
requirements and respond to innovative opportunities, not immediately
moving to design the next generation. In parallel, the extent of industrial
rationalisation means that sustaining competition to meet domestic
requirements is increasingly diffi cult. In several sectors, following the
entry into service of major projects, there will be substantial overcapacity
in production facilities in the UK defence industry in a few years’ time.

A1.5 And as we look to non-UK sources of supply, whether at the prime or
sub-systems level, we need to continue to recognise the extent to which this
constrains the choices we can make about how we use our Armed Forces - in
other words, how we maintain our sovereignty and national security. We need
to be clear that the international nature of the defence business is such that
companies now have more choice than ever before about the markets in which
they choose to operate, which secure the best returns for shareholders, and
where to base their operations. And we need to be clear about how the nature
of global capital markets shapes these commercial judgements. If we do not
make clear which industrial capabilities we need to have onshore (and this
includes those maintained by foreign-owned defence companies), industry
may make independent decisions which would lead to the disappearance
of indigenous capabilities required to maintain our national security.


A1.6 Equally, we do not seek to restrict the scope for international
cooperation and competition where this is appropriate, and we
cannot aff ord to maintain a complete cradle-to-grave industrial
base in all areas. As industry has told us, greater clarity is therefore
needed urgently on which capabilities must be retained onshore,
and which by implication can be met from a wider market.


-----

A1.7 These factors necessitate a fresh consideration of how best
we should seek to engage with the marketplace in order to meet our
requirements; and drive the need for a Defence Industrial Strategy (DIS).

###### The aim of the Defence Industrial Strategy

A1.8 The DIS fl ows from the Defence Industrial Policy (DIP)
published in 2002. Like that policy, it is ‘driven by the need to provide
the Armed Forces with the equipment which they require, on time,
and at best value for money for the taxpayer.’ The DIS is thus one of
many contributions to the wider aim of ensuring that the capability
requirements of the Armed Forces can be met, now and in the future.

A1.9 The DIS is thus one of many contributions to the
wider aim of ensuring that the capability requirements of
the Armed Forces can be met, now and in the future.

A1.10 The contribution that a DIS can off er towards that overriding aim
is in promoting a sustainable industrial base, that retains in the UK those
industrial capabilities (including infrastructure, skills, tacit knowledge,
Intellectual Property (IP) and capacity) needed to ensure appropriate
sovereignty and/or contribute to co-operation with allies, to ensure our
national security, but allows us to benefi t from products on the broader
international market where appropriate, to maximise our Armed Forces’
cost-eff ectiveness. Our interaction with this industrial base must provide good
value to the taxpayer and good returns to shareholders based on delivery of
good performance, and be consistent with broader security and economic
policy. This explicitly includes the need to continue to make the UK a great
place to establish, grow and invest in high-technology defence businesses.

A1.11 This recognises that while the industrial base from which we
procure is global, sourcing from the UK in certain areas will be essential for
our long-term interests. The UK industrial base needs to be sustainable,
which means taking a long-term perspective, considering all the levers
available to government, and taking into account the impact of diff erent
procurement choices on specifi c sectors or industry as a whole. We recognise
the need to generate fair returns in business. Consistency with broader
security and economic policy in the contribution includes issues like:

¬ the importance of preventing WMD related, and
undesirable conventional, proliferation;

¬ consistency with the Government’s spending plans, and a
recognition that priorities may change in the future;

¬ consistency with other government initiatives and strategies, such
as the Government’s Manufacturing Strategy and our Technology
Strategy, which also aff ect parts of the UK defence industry[1].

A1.12 This acknowledges the over-capacity that exists - when viewed
against our likely future requirements - in several sectors of the industrial
base; and recognises the likelihood that some further rationalisation is
inevitable (and in some cases is already being actively considered by certain
companies). As such, it provides a mechanism for shaping and managing
that process to the benefi t of both the customer and its suppliers.

_1 The DIP states that the UK defence industry ‘embraces all defence_
**_suppliers that create value, employment, technology or intellectual_**
**_assets in the UK. This includes both UK and foreign-owned companies’._**
_‘The UK defence industry should therefore be defi ned in terms of where the_
_technology is created, where the skills and the intellectual property reside,_
_h_ _j b_ _d_ _d_ _i d_ _d h_ _h i_ _i_ _d ’_


###### Objectives

A1.13 To deliver this aim, the DIS:

¬ gives a strategic view of defence capability requirements going
forward (including new projects, but also the support and
upgrade of equipment already in-service), by sector[2]. Part of
the strategic view is specifying, in order to meet these, which
industrial capabilities we would wish to see retained in the
UK for defence reasons. We aim to communicate the overall
view to industry as clearly as possible, recognising that plans
change as the strategic or fi nancial environment changes;

¬ gives further detail on the principles and processes that
underpin procurement and industrial decisions;

¬ where there is a mismatch between the level of activity our own
plans (and export/civil opportunities) would support and that
required to sustain desired capabilities, investigates how we might
with industry address that gap, within the bounds of aff ordability.

A1.14 As a result, industry will be better able to make informed
investment decisions, and industry and Government can focus on
improving delivery and productivity. Industry should note that if an
industrial capability is not specifi ed as a strategic priority for retention
in the UK, this does not necessarily mean UK companies cannot win
business in those areas; we may still have important projects there.

###### The scope of the DIS

A1.15 We began work last year to construct a framework or matrix of
key technologies which, for reasons of national security, broader defence
interest or wider economic benefi ts, we might wish to retain in the UK,
so that these could be explicitly taken into account in future procurement
decisions. But we now intend to move beyond saying what we care about,
to how this may be fostered and maintained, not least because it is clear
that several branches of industry are considering making substantial and
time-sensitive independent restructuring decisions in the near future.

A1.16 Given these drivers for early clarity, we needed to
act quickly. There are three levels to this strategy:

¬ promoting an overall business environment which is
attractive to defence companies and investors;

¬ identifying key industrial capabilities which are important
to Defence to retain in the UK industrial base to maintain
appropriate sovereignty (see further below), with
sustainment strategies where these seem at risk;

¬ explaining how, in decisions on individual projects, we
take into account industrial and other factors.

_2 Although we are increasingly thinking and structuring ourselves in capability_
_or technology terms we recognise that industry is structured by sector or product,_
_and thus we have to articulate our needs in this way within this document._
_3 i.e., focus on military equipment and operational services (such as the_
_Strategic Sealift Service and the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft) rather than_
_indirect support services (such as regional prime contracting, non-operational_
_Information Technology, facilities management) which also fall within our_
_defi nition of the UK defence industry (‘Economic activity that is supported_
_b UKMOD_ _di_ _d_ _fd f_ _d_ _d_ _i_ _’)_


-----

A1.17 For the second of these, developing a strategic view has meant focusing
on key sectors which have direct impact on key defence outputs[3] and where a)
we anticipate potential restructuring in any case; and/or b) which are strategic
priorities for our future capabilities. In each area, we have only drilled-down
to the extent necessary. In Part B, therefore, we have covered the following
sectors, in all cases for support and upgrade as well as initial acquisition:

¬ Submarines and surface ships
¬ Armoured Fighting Vehicles
¬ Fixed wing aircraft, including UAVs
¬ Helicopters
¬ General munitions
¬ Complex weapons
¬ C4ISTAR
¬ CBRN Force Protection
¬ Counter Terrorism


increased assurances of security of supply, but there are critical areas where not
maintaining assured access to onshore industrial capabilities would compromise
this operational independence and hence our national security. The extent to
which we feel comfortable sourcing defence equipment from overseas is also a
function, amongst other things, of our ability to negotiate with other nations
arrangements to share the technologies required to support such capabilities
through-life and adjust them to our national requirements as necessary. Such
national security considerations are also relevant where we need to retain
sovereignty due to the extreme security sensitivity of the technology concerned
or for legal reasons; where specifi c UK capabilities give us important strategic
infl uence, in military, diplomatic or industrial terms; and in some cases, where
retention is necessary to maintain realistic global competition - in other words,
where we are not prepared to risk dependency on an overseas monopoly which
could in time frustrate our ability to maintain our freedom of military action.

A1.22 At the same time, we must be prepared to exploit the opportunities
engendered by co-operative arrangements with others, where it makes
operational and economic sense to do so; recognise that increasing mutual
dependence on supply from other states is in many cases not only happening
but desirable; and continue to encourage inward investment from overseas.
We articulate in this strategy some of the policy tools available to maintain the
‘national’ status of diff erent technologies, recognising that the legal and policy
frameworks for defence markets in Europe and the United States are evolving.
We of course also recognise the broader attractions of the UK for business,
including macro economic stability and the support available to UK industry and
science and technology from other government departments and agencies.


###### A1


A1.18 In addition, there are three separate chapters on the
very important cross-cutting issues of Technology Priorities,
**Systems Engineering and Test & Evaluation (T&E).**

**_Full deck operations during handover with HMS INVINCIBLE._**


A1.19 Taking forward this strategy is likely to mean internal change
within Government and MOD too; this is covered with Part C, on change and
implementation. But we precede these sections with a Strategic Context
in Part A, which includes the military context which drives our equipment
needs; analysis of the changing shape of the global and UK defence
marketplace; an overview of the features which make the UK attractive to
Defence companies, researchers and investors; and explains how we take
industrial and other wider factors like export potential into account, including
in deciding between competitive and other procurement strategies.

###### Guiding principles


**Through-life capability management**

A1.23 There is a general shift in defence acquisition away from the
traditional pattern of designing and manufacturing successive generations
of platforms - leaps of capability with major new procurements or very
signifi cant upgrade packages - towards a new paradigm centred on support,
sustainability and the incremental enhancement of existing capabilities
from technology insertions. The emphasis will increasingly be on throughlife capability management, developing open architectures that facilitate
this and maintaining - and possibly enhancing - the systems engineering
competencies that underpin it. The attractions for industry should, in general,
include longer, more assured revenue streams based on long-term support and
ongoing development rather than a series of big ‘must win’ procurements.


**Maintaining key and rapid industrial**
**capabilities and skills**

A1.24 In those areas where reduced UK and export market opportunities
cannot any longer provide a sustainable production profi le, the DIS needs to
address the challenge of maintaining key industrial capabilities. Often, this
may be about sustaining and developing small pools of expertise or knowledge
(including tacit knowledge) within or across the supply chain rather than
focused on particular facilities or existing technologies. We need to identify
these as far as possible, and develop appropriate options to maintain them.


A1.20 Against this background, and in order to set the framework
for the DIS, six guiding principles have been developed.

**Appropriate sovereignty**


A1.21 We must maintain the appropriate degree of sovereignty over
industrial skills, capacities, capabilities and technology to ensure operational
independence against the range of operations that we wish to be able to
conduct. This is not ‘procurement independence’, or total reliance on national
supply of all elements, and will diff er across technologies and projects. It
covers not only being assured of delivery of ongoing contracts, but also the
ability to respond to Urgent Operational Requirements (UORs) (taking into
account other customers’ likely demands at the same time), where systems
engineering skills amongst others may be important, and to support inservice equipment. In many, even high priority areas, we can, and do, rely
dh d i i d l i


**Intelligent customers-intelligent suppliers:**
**the importance of systems engineering**

A1.25 Notwithstanding that some key knowledge potentially rests in very
small teams, in many (though not all) sectors, the ability to understand and
sometimes manage the complexities, challenges and costs associated with
overall management of design, manufacture and upgrade remains a general
requirement. This is important at a number of diff erent points in the acquisition
cycle: we need to preserve the capacity for sensible industry-MOD conversations
when a capability is in concept phase and a number of potential technologies to
d li i b i id d i i i l l i i i l


-----

for the successful acquisition of complex projects and programmes; and in-life
upgrades, including UORs, often require deep systems engineering skills and
knowledge, often relating to systems brought into service many years before. But
the depth of design for producability and systems engineering capability, and the
concentration of eff ort needed in the UK supply base will vary throughout the
CADMID[4] cycle and from sector to sector, and needs to be considered accordingly.

**Value for Defence**

A1.26 Driving long-term best value for money lies at the heart of our Defence
acquisition policy. But despite the opportunities to exploit the internationalization
of the defence supply chain to generate cost savings and other advantages, we
recognise the benefi ts that fl ow from the existence of a healthy, competitive
and dynamic national industry (whether in terms of the amortisation of
overheads associated with export sales or the risks of being subject to monopoly
power should we have to look exclusively overseas for some requirements).
As the DIP made clear, where defence procurement decisions impact on wider
Government, this will be considered and the DIS will include understanding of
the role of Government and industry, in setting a framework which maximises
value and contributes to the national Science and Technology base.

**Change on both sides**

A1.27 Industry is likely to change as a result of taking the DIS’ conclusions
into account. We, along with the wider Government, will need to change
too. As well as considering structural and cultural changes, we have set
out more clearly our future plans. We have also explained how we can
identify situations where, unusually, competition at a particular point or
level is not the best solution to drive innovation, encourage investment
and produce a fair price; and indicate how, in those situations, value for
money is scrutinized, incentivised and protected. We have also set out
the improvement in performance we expect from the supply side.

###### Military strategic overview
### A2 A2


###### Delivering security in a changing world

A2.1 The December 2003 Defence White Paper ‘Delivering security in
a changing world’ set out the Government’s analysis of the future security
environment, the implications for defence, our strategic priorities and how
we intend to adapt our planning and force structures to meet the most likely
threats and challenges. The White Paper explained the need to adapt to the more
pronounced threats presented by international terrorism, the proliferation of
Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and the challenges posed to the international
community by weak and failing states. It also explained how Defence should
exploit the opportunities presented by eff ects-based planning and operations
together with highly networked and adaptable forces across all three Services.


###### Military strategic overview
### A2


¬ that the force structure should be rebalanced and optimised to meet the
demands of up to three concurrent small and medium scale operations;

¬ that we should retain the fl exibility to reconfi gure for less frequent, but
more complex and demanding, large scale operations, while concurrently
conducting a small-scale peace support operation. For large scale
operations we will not need to generate the full spectrum of military
capabilities as the most demanding operations could only conceivably
be undertaken alongside the US, either as a NATO operation or US-led
coalition. Where the UK chooses to be engaged, we will wish to be able
to infl uence political and military decision-making throughout the crisis,
including during the post-confl ict period. To exploit this eff ectively, our
Armed Forces need to be interoperable with US command and control
structures, match the US operational tempo and provide those capabilities
that deliver the greatest impact when operating alongside the US;


even more quickly than has previously been the case. This places
a premium on the deployability and sustainability of our forces;

¬ that we should plan to be able to operate in six core regions:
the Near East, the Gulf, sub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia,
and in and around Europe. However, counter-terrorism and
counter proliferation operations in particular will require
rapidly deployable forces able to respond swiftly and achieve
precise eff ects in a range of environments across the world;


¬ that we should maintain a broad spectrum of maritime, land
air, logistics, C4ISTAR[1] and Special Forces capability elements
to ensure we are able to conduct limited national operations,
and be capable to lead and act as the framework nation
for coalition operations where the US is not involved;

¬ that we must continue the transformation of our forces to
concentrate on speed, precision, agility, deployability, reach and
sustainability. Key to this is our ability to exploit the benefi ts
of Network Enabled Capability, precision munitions and the
development of eff ects-based planning and operations;


**_Chinook helicopters delivering aid after the_**
**_devastating earthquake in Pakistan._**

A2.2 The White Paper formed the policy baseline for the ‘Future
Capabilities’ Command Paper of July 2004, which set out the force structure
and capability changes required to respond to these changes in the security
environment. ‘Future Capabilities’ indicated our intention to continue the
process of modernising Defence, investing our resources in the capabilities and
structures which provide fl exible and adaptable high quality Armed Forces,
properly equipped to deal with the challenges and threats of the future.


A2.4 Our future forces must be strategically agile in order to respond to
changing needs and circumstances. Agility comprises four key attributes:

¬ **Responsiveness - Those capabilities that underpin our speed**
of response: Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance
(ISR), force projection, and logistic support. Early application
of military capability is likely to deliver strategic eff ects more
quickly and economically. Therefore, improved strategic reach,
precision and endurance are desirable characteristics.


¬ that we need capabilities which can rapidly come together to achieve
specifi c military eff ect and then rapidly adapt with other capabilities
to achieve what is required by the next operation. By doing so, decisive
military eff ect may be achieved through a smaller number of more capable,
linked assets acting quickly and precisely to achieve a desired outcome.


A2.3 The documents set out a revised set of assumptions and
implications to underpin future Defence planning. These include:

¬ the need to defend the UK, protect our interests overseas, counter
the threats from the proliferation of WMD and international
terrorism, and deal with the consequences of weak and failing
i l f j i f f h fi ld d

-----

¬ **Robustness - Future equipment must operate with increased**
reliability and availability. Force elements must be able to maintain
sustained, high tempo operations against a range of diverse
but eff ective opponents. We will require combat and support
capabilities that are versatile across the full spectrum of operations.

¬ **Flexibility - People, structures and equipment should be capable**
of conducting a wide range of Military Tasks with the fl exibility to
reorganise and re-role. Wherever possible, niche capabilities that have
limited utility across the range of Military Tasks should be avoided.

¬ **Adaptability - Personnel and units should be well-trained**
and have high utility equipment so they can adapt to changing
circumstances. An important aspect of adaptability is being able
to readily introduce modifi cations arising from new technology.

A2.5 To achieve our mission within a challenging strategic
environment will require fl exibility from across Defence, from our
equipment, force structures and people. We must adapt to stay
ahead of potential adversaries and be prepared to make tough
decisions to ensure that our forces and equipment deliver the required
capabilities. Force structures will need constantly to evolve as we seek
to exploit new technologies, equipment and techniques to improve
capability and respond to the changing strategic environment.

A2.6 Within a resource-constrained environment we must aim to maintain
a technological and capability edge over our likely adversaries but not pursue
the best for the best’s sake. We also require incremental acquisition processes
with procedures that align equipment requirements and specifi cations strictly
to the current and expected future threat, recognising and accepting the
value and potential cost of fl exibility and incremental upgrades. We need to
develop standard and Urgent Operational Requirement (UOR) procurement
processes that are fl exible, agile and responsive and minimise the lead time
between the emergence of new technology or threat capabilities, and the
delivery of new equipment or enhancements to existing capabilities. ‘Just


in Time’ investment to fi ne tune equipment and capabilities rapidly with
the latest technology in readiness for specifi c operations will be a necessary
and increasingly important feature of operations. Adaptive and modular
architectures could support system resilience and allow for systems evolution
and insertion of new hardware and software. In the context of the latter,
commercial-off -the-shelf (COTS) technology has much to off er but potential
risks in reliability, supportability and security must be adequately addressed.

A2.7 At the heart of the force structure and capabilities modernising
programme is Network Enabled Capability (NEC). NEC is about the coherent
integration of sensors, decision-makers and weapon systems along with
support capabilities. NEC will enable the UK to operate more eff ectively in
the future strategic environment through the more effi cient sharing and
exploitation of information within the UK Armed Forces and with other
coalition partners. This will lead to better situational awareness across the
board, facilitating improved decision making, and bringing to bear the right
military capabilities at the right time to achieve the desired military eff ect.
This enhanced capability is about more then equipment; it includes exploiting
the benefi ts to be obtained from transformed doctrine and training, and
optimised command and control structures. The ability to respond more quickly
and precisely will act as a force multiplier enabling our forces to achieve the
desired eff ect through smaller numbers or more capable linked assets. In
summary, the emphasis is no longer on quantity as a measure of capability.

A2.8 **Maritime - The sea provides a degree of security, without reliance**
on the territory of others, for projecting power across the battle space to
strengthen our military advantage. Furthermore, protection of our maritime
supply routes is essential in securing our ability to trade globally thus critical
to the UK’s wealth and security. To meet the challenges of the future, the
Royal Navy (RN) will need to be an increasingly versatile, network-enabled
expeditionary force, continuing to operate on, under and over the sea, on
land (with the Royal Marines) and ever more frequently in the littoral, fully
interoperable and integrated with UK and allied forces. To support this
transformation we are investing in two large aircraft carriers to operate
the Joint Combat Aircraft (operated by both RAF and RN personnel) and
amphibious shipping. These new Fleet units will transform our carrier
strike capabilities and enhance our ability to project power onto the land
environment. They will be supported by our future Air Defence ships, the Type
45 destroyers and new nuclear powered attack submarines, the Astute class,
which will also contribute to the securing of our maritime supply routes.


replace many obsolete vehicles and form the core of our future medium weight
force. In parallel the eff ectiveness of our land forces will be further enhanced
through Bowman, networked surveillance systems such as Watchkeeper and
ASTOR, and improved digitization and simulation of our training. There is also a
substantial equipment programme underway to improve our dismounted combat
capability. These changes will allow our Army the ability to conduct short notice
expeditionary operations more effi ciently; allowing a more eff ective response
to a wider range of possible contingencies, while at the same time retaining the
ability for war-fi ghting at large scale eff ort with heavy forces if necessary.

A2.10 **Air - Airpower has been shown to be a critically important aspect of**
modern warfare. The RAF is driving forward modernisation to create a fl exible and
agile Air Force equipped with highly capable multi-role aircraft such as Typhoon
and Joint Combat Aircraft, increasingly able to exploit networked capabilities and
equipped with a range of advanced stand-off precision weapons. We are purchasing
the fl eet of four C-17’s we currently lease plus an additional aircraft, which will
operate in the future alongside the new A400M military transport aircraft. ASTOR
and Nimrod MRA4 will improve situational awareness for our commanders to
bring them improved level of accuracy and speed of response. These changes
aim to ensure that we can adapt to new threats and environments and that we
are able to maintain air superiority and deploy forces worldwide in the future.


A2.11 The chapters within Part B further consider the future strategic themes
in the context of specifi c industrial sectors. Each sector chapter looks closely at
the future requirement for capability to support the Armed Forces and identify
the UK industrial base that is essential in achieving these requirements.

###### Selection criteria

A2.9 **Land - The operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in the last few years**
have demonstrated the continued need for war-fi ghting capabilities at the high
intensity end of the military spectrum. At the same time both theatres, and in
particular Iraq, revealed the essential need to have the ability to rapidly reconfi gure
forces in theatre as the confl ict develops from heavy war-fi ghting to enduring
peace support and post-confl ict reconstruction. The ability to meet this changing
requirement is recognised by Future Army Structure, which involves a shift from
the current mix of light and heavy forces to a more balanced structure of light,
medium and heavy forces. This change will be underpinned by some key elements
including Apache (which is already in-service), Guided Multi Launch Rocket System
(GMLRS) and Indirect Fire Precision Attack (IFPA) providing an agile precision attack

A2.12 Every nation ideally wants to keep under its control critical defence
technologies, but no country outside the US can aff ord to have a full
cradle to grave industry in every sector, and our Armed Forces continue to
benefi t from the extensive range of foreign-sourced equipment currently in
service. And it is readily recognised that much of the equipment procured
from UK prime contractors contains non UK sourced content. We welcome
the progress made in establishing understandings on Security of Supply
(the US/UK Declaration of Principles and the Letter of Intent Framework
Agreement). Moreover, we recognise the potential benefi ts that may be
realised from the November 2005 decision by the EU Defence Ministers
to introduce a Code of Conduct on Defence Procurement which aims to
create an eff ective European Defence Equipment Market. We continue to
welcome overseas products off ered in competition, and indeed in many
signifi cant areas rely on overseas supply, with appropriate guarantees
(which may include technology access to ensure we can adapt equipment
to meet national requirements over time) and/or judgement that any
increased risk to maintaining our operational independence is acceptable.

A2.13 The UK also retains a sizable, open and broadly-based defence
industry which delivers a large proportion of MOD’s needs, and we
welcome overseas investment, especially from companies that create
value, employment, technology or intellectual assets in the UK and thus
become part of the UK defence industry. Within this strategy, we aim to
tell industry very clearly where, to maintain our national security and keep
the sovereign ability to use our Armed Forces in the way we choose, we
need particular industrial capabilities in the UK (which does not preclude
them being owned or established by foreigned-owned companies). We
have therefore assessed industrial capabilities selection criteria developed
to assist us in identifying which aspects of the UK industrial base are
essential for us to sustain onshore in order to deliver the capability the
Armed Forces require. This process was trialled jointly with industry under
the auspices of the National Defence Industries Council (NDIC). The criteria
refl ect the overarching principle of Appropriate Sovereignty - indigenous

discussed earlier in the strategy. They fall under the following headings:

¬ **Strategic assurance - Capabilities which are to be retained onshore**
as they provide those technologies or equipment important for
the safeguard of the state. Such technologies could include those
used within the nuclear deterrent, high-grade cryptography or
that are a key tenet of our counter terrorism capability. Industrial
capabilities could be classifi ed under this heading if for instance:

¬ the technology is of such strategic importance that the
risk of obtaining the required industrial capability from
overseas is unacceptable. The UK Government could simply
not countenance sourcing the capability from overseas;

¬ we require minimal or no risk of the capability
failing given its strategic importance. The risk of
sourcing the capability from overseas increases the
likelihood of associated military capability failure;

¬ we need to prevent an adversary from acquiring
knowledge which could present them with the capacity
to prevent our Armed Forces eff ectively deploying
or using the associated military capability;

¬ procurement or sourcing the industrial capability
from overseas is prohibited for legal reasons,
e.g. contravening treaty obligations.

¬ **Defence capability - The retention of equipment and technology**
within the UK industrial base is necessary as our Armed Forces
require particular assurance of continued and consistent equipment
performance. This could include those of particular operational
importance, or aspects of more generic battlefi eld systems or subsystems, where failure could present particular danger to our Armed
Forces. Industrial capabilities could fall under this heading if, for instance:

¬ there is a specifi c need to assure the security of supply
of an industrial capability or technology. There could be
a viable global and open marketplace for the industrial
capability, however the assurance of supply could be
suspect and would present too great a risk to the availability
and reliability of eff ective equipment performance for
our Armed Forces. In some cases, we may not yet be able
to ensure suffi cient access to Intellectual Property Rights
from overseas to provide confi dence in our ability to
understand its true operational performance or to update
the equipment over time, in which case there may be little
option to seeking to produce an indigenous capability.

¬ failing to sustain the capability in the UK would lead to
reliance on a single overseas source. This may in itself
present a risk of adverse political interference from
the relevant overseas Government at the point that
the UK seeks to procure from the relevant supplier.

¬ it is important to ensure that associated Intellectual
Property (IP) within the UK is protected and not transferred
to a potential adversary. Transfer of such IP to an adversary
could result in replication of our military capability
and possible use against our own Armed Forces.

¬ it is particularly important that our Armed Forces have
i i h i d i l b d d


enable eff ective equipment acquisition, support and
upgrade when and where we require it. This may be of
particular importance when seeking to meet UORs. This is
closely related to the broader concept of security of supply,
but applies when a foreign supplier might otherwise be
willing, but may be unavailable to meet the requirement in
time - either because of the distances involved, or because
their domestic customer has fi rst call on his capacity.

¬ **Strategic infl uence - where specifi c UK capabilities give us**
important strategic infl uence, in military, diplomatic or industrial
terms. Collaborative or complementary programmes may often
be relevant here. Such programmes may be pursued to ensure
value for money and aff ordability in complex programmes and
to help enable cohesive coalition operations. The UK continues
to enjoy the ability to actively participate in such programmes
partly as a result of an industrial base which has a strong history
of providing world-class capabilities and technologies across all
military environments and platforms. This heritage gives the UK
Government leverage in and access to these programmes. Once
engaged, we can better ensure that our requirements can be met
cost-eff ectively and bringing to bear the strengths of UK industry.
But strategic infl uence can also come at the military and strategic
diplomatic levels, especially when the UK can bring something
distinctively diff erent to the table. Thus capabilities prioritised under
this heading may have one or more of the following characteristics:

¬ continued possession and development of an industrial
capability onshore enables access to a unique UK
military capability. This military capability also enables
UK military planners to have particular infl uence in
the development of coalition operations, and the
acknowledged merits of the capability concerned
may increase diplomatic infl uence more generally;

¬ it has particular cutting edge characteristics which
ensures that the UK can ensure due weight is put
on its requirements and achieve equitable and
fair technology share in collaborative equipment
or research programme with other nations;

¬ it is important to ensure access to a particular collaboration
project. This in turn may help to strengthen political and
diplomatic relationships between the UK and another nations.

A2.14 **Technology Benefi ts - The UK defence industrial base has in the**
past been a productive and innovative source of technologies and capabilities
which have had follow on civil applications. Defence has then benefi ted
from the associated economies of scale. There continue to be opportunities
to pull through military technology to the civil market, recent advances in
biomedical screening are a good example. Therefore, the continued investment
by Government in certain areas could help enable further opportunities. We
recognise that this is not always directly an issue of national security, but it
is a consideration to capture, in ensuring that our policy is consistent with
broader Government policy on promoting innovation. In practice, we have
not found any capability which was important to retain only for this reason.

###### Defence planning

A2.15 In order to understand the nature of our forward plans
and the way they are described in this document, it is important
to recognise the framework within which they sit.


-----

A2.16 MOD policy staff develop Defence Strategic Guidance
(DSG), a classifi ed document developed in consultation with other
government departments and approved by the Secretary of State for
Defence. The DSG includes detailed defence planning assumptions and
is informed by a comprehensive methodology and suite of analytical
tools. It is our principal strategic direction for the development of
Defence and the policy baseline for our planning cycle. It establishes
key planning parameters and priorities for resource allocation and
capability development, stretching out broadly over the next 15 years.

A2.17 Government Spending **Reviews usually take place every two**
years (although the last Spending Review, which concluded in 2004, will
be followed by a Comprehensive Spending Review reporting in 2007).
Spending Review settlements conventionally set Departmental budgets
for the following three years, with the fi nal year of the period forming
the baseline for the next Spending Review. Whilst Departmental budgets
may be subject to adjustments in the intervening period - for example,
to respond to fi scal shocks or in the case of Defence, to reimburse the
Department for the net additional cost of operations - budgets should
essentially be regarded as fi xed between Spending Reviews.


Logistic Organisation, for the support of in-service equipment.
A2.20 The EP covers a 10 year period, and sets out how we plan
to spend the funds provided for the acquisition of new equipment
for the Armed Forces. The requirements for new equipment
are set by the Equipment Capability Customer (ECC), whilst the
procurement is carried out by the Defence Procurement Agency.

A2.21 Within the ECC, it is the responsibility of the Directors of Equipment
**Capability (DECs) to develop coherent equipment capability solutions. The**
DECs who report to a Joint Capabilities Board, chair Capability Working
**Groups (CWGs) are to assess and develop options for the delivery of future**
capability programmes. CWGs are the structure through which the relevant
stakeholders come together to co-ordinate planning across all the Defence
lines of development, including organisation, concepts and doctrine, training,
infrastructure, information, personnel and logistics as well as equipment,
in order to deliver military, rather than simply equipment, capability.


###### A2


A2.18 We conduct an internal planning **round to incorporate the**
overall Defence budget set in the Spending Review in a forward Defence
**Programme and underpinning resource allocation to budget holders. The**
Defence Programme is reviewed and adjusted every two yeas, and comprises
two core elements: the Short Term Plan (STP) and the Equipment Plan
(EP). Beyond the end of the Spending Review period these are only indictive
planning assumptions, recognising that budgets can go down as well as up.

A2.19 The STP looks out over a four year period, and covers the
running costs of Defence and some areas of capital investment. Aside
from covering major areas of expenditure such as pay and investment
in estates and business information systems, of particular interest
in the context of the DIS is that the STP provides the budget for the
Science Innovation and Technology organisation and the Defence


A2.22 DECs conduct Capability Audits, underpinned by operational
analysis, military assessment panels and balance of investment studies,
to determine whether they are meeting their capability objectives. The
audits use a set of planning scenarios - derived on the DSG - against
which to assess whether or not the EP will deliver the capabilities UK
forces need to meet the most likely operational tasks of the future,
including the requirement to conduct operations of a certain scale
simultaneously. The audits feed into a Capability Area Plan (CAP) which
is an authoritative statement of a DECs capability surpluses and shortfalls,
and a route map for future capability development. The CAP guides the
activity of the CWG and is the source of any proposals to adjust the EP.

A2.23 It is important to understand what this means in practice
about the nature of Defence planning and our forward plans:

¬ Our formal budgets only extend, at most, three years ahead.
Where the STP and the EP extend out beyond the time horizon
of the government’s formal spending plans set in the Spending
review, these are internal MOD planning assumptions and are
subject to change as the government periodically reassesses its
priorities. Whilst it is essential that we plan beyond the period
for which we have a formal Defence budget from the Spending
Review, planning assumptions and costs are inevitably ever more
uncertain the further out into the STP and EP period one looks.


����������
��������


¬ Whilst the Treasury will take existing Departmental plans into
account as we set new budgets in the Spending Review, no
Department - including the MOD - can assume that future
settlements will continue past trends in budgetary allocation.

¬ Within a budget set by the Spending Review settlement,
our planning is essentially a process of prioritisation.
Decisions to allocate more resources to areas of high
priority must be off set by savings elsewhere.

¬ It is very important to maintain fl exibility in our planning.
The security challenges we face, and hence Defence
priorities, will always be subject to change, as will cost.
Our planning must be fl exible enough to respond to such
changes in the strategic and resource environment.

¬ Conversely, our ability to make adjustments to the
forward Defence Programme in the shorter term is more
constrained. For example, as fi gure A2(ii) illustrates,
the high level of contractual commitment to existing
projects in early years of the EP limits (although does not
preclude) our ability to make changes in this period.

¬ For a project to have an EP or STP funding line does not necessary
mean that the project has been given approval to proceed to
the delivery phase. It is only at Main Gate, the main investment
decision point, that the commitment to the solution and
specifi c performance, cost and time parameters is made.

¬ Looking to the longer term, we will tend (save for where specifi c
contractual commitments have been made) only to have an intent
or capability aspirations beyond the EP period, together with a view
of strategic priorities and the broad order fi nancial consequences
of the most signifi cant programmes. Knowing the industrial
capabilities likely to be required to meet such aspirations will be
dependent on technological developments and investigation of
the full range of potential solutions to the capability need.

###### Introduction

A3.1 This chapter outlines the main characteristics of the defence
market at global and national UK levels, identifying recent changes,
current state and forecast near term trends. This understanding provides
important context for assessing the likely evolution of our supplier base, the
implications and the degree to which we and wider Government can assume
levels of positive infl uence and where necessary control over the supplier
base to secure DIS objectives. The DIS does not seek to set out a preferred
route to international restructuring; that is very much industry’s business.
But it does seek to create a clear UK context to inform these decisions.

A3.2 The chapter fi nishes with a framework of levers available
to governments which aff ect industry at both the general level, i.e.
the overall attractiveness of the defence business environment in
a particular country, and at the specifi c level, to achieve defi ned
outcomes in particular capability or technology areas. The next
chapter considers in more detail how these are applied in the UK.

**_Figure A3(i)._**


A3.3 The last 15 years have seen major changes in governments’
defence requirements and funding profi les. Driven by the demise of the
Warsaw Pact, global defence spending fell sharply in the 1990s by a third
in real terms from $1,300 billion (or around £800 billion) in 1989 to $800
billion (or around £500 billion) in 1996[1] . In the US, the world’s largest
defence market, the cuts were particularly signifi cant and had a major
impact on industry, driving rationalisation and consolidation within the US
supply base. A similar, but less pronounced, eff ect was seen in Europe.

A3.4 However, since 9/11 the emergence of new threats and the
emphasis on national security has resulted in increased defence spending,
most notably in the USA, with increases, albeit not on the same scale,
also in most European countries, including the UK and France. Following
an 18% increase in real terms over the last few years, global defence
spending has now reached nearly $1,000 billion (or around £600 billion)[2].


A3.7 Not only is the USA the largest spender, it has also continued
to increase spend with a rise of 4% in real terms since 2002. The largest
growing category of spend is research and development which has grown
11% in the same period[3].  With these disproportionate levels of defence
spending, the defence industrial, technological and military gap between
the USA and the rest of the world continues to grow. Indeed, in some
areas, the USA aspires to have technology ‘way ahead’ of others[4].

**Industrial development**


A3.10 European consolidation progressed more slowly, in part due to
the continuing political pressure to retain capability at a national level.
European rationalisation took a number of forms: internal national mergers
(e.g. British Aerospace with GEC), the use of joint ventures to bridge national
boundaries (e.g. MBDA) and limited cross-boundary consolidation (notably
EADS). As a result there are now several large European companies – namely
BAE Systems, EADS, Thales and Finmeccanica. Further rationalisation is
still expected. Within the UK consolidation has been taken further than
in wider Europe and the industrial structure is now relatively mature and
stable, although further rationalisation within this construct is possible.

A3.11 US companies continue to dominate the global defence industry.
As Figure A3(ii) below demonstrates, 7 out of the top 10 defence companies
are now US-based. BAE Systems is the fourth largest international
defence company refl ecting not only its leading UK position but also
success in accessing a share of the large US market. Whilst these defence
companies are giants within the defence market, accounting for around
50% of global sales in 2004, they are relatively small in global corporate


A3.8 In response to the falling defence budgets of the 1990s, signifi cant
consolidation took place in the defence industries of the USA and Europe.

A3.9 In the USA the consolidation was framed by the government’s
commitment to rationalisation whilst retaining competition at the
prime contractor level. This resulted in the creation of fi ve large
and globally important US defence companies: Lockheed Martin,
Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Boeing and General Dynamics.


A3.5 Of this, the defence market (i.e. Governmental spend with
industry) is estimated to be worth almost £200 billion worldwide.
This is largely split into discrete national markets. As fi gure A3(i)
shows, the USA is by far the largest market at around £90 billion in
2004. The implication of this scale, and the high proportion spent on
research and technology, is that the DoD leads in the development
and exploitation of key enabling defence technologies and tends to
have an infl uential lead in developing advanced military doctrine and
concepts for use of those technologies in an operational environment.

A3.6 At the next level down, despite Russia, China, Japan, the
UK and France all being major defence spenders, the UK market is
signifi cantly larger than the others because we are increasingly relying
on industry to take on new roles beyond equipment development and
manufacture; an increasing proportion of our budget is spent sourcing
products and services from a largely private sector industrial base.

A3.12 Not all of these companies have the breadth and scale to
deliver the broadest range of defence business, at the integrated
platform and system level, across the land, sea and air environments.
These include, for example, BAE Systems and Lockheed Martin.
Others such as Raytheon and Honeywell, whilst still large defence
players, are more focused on specifi c types of business.

A3.13 The major defence companies, who take on the delivery of
complex, integrated systems and platforms, are heavily dependent on a wide
range of lower level suppliers, many of whom are signifi cant international
companies in their own right. A large proportion of the specialist intellectual
property and innovation so essential to delivering world-class military
capability is believed to lie in these lower tiers of the supply base.


###### European perspective

A3.14 The European defence environment can be characterised
as a set of largely separate domestic markets. In general continental
European markets are both smaller than the UK market and less open.

A3.15 The desire to make European military contributions more
eff ective, combined with the economic realities associated with nations
sustaining largely separate markets, has nevertheless prompted initiatives
in cooperative procurement including several major programmes (such as
the Airbus A400M and MBDA Meteor) utilising OCCAR[5] and more recently
the creation of the European Defence Agency. A recent Commission Green
Paper on the European defence market[6] recognises that greater effi ciencies
can be achieved in European defence procurement. However, as in other
European policy areas, there are signifi cant integration challenges and
national interests remain a dominant factor. EU enlargement adds a further
dimension of complexity since countries such as Poland are highly aligned
with the USA and will often favour purchasing US defence products and
services. Enthusiasm from governments and industry for collaborative
development programmes has undoubtedly been tempered by diffi culties
experienced on some high profi le collaborative ventures in recent years.

A3.16 In practice, the European market remains fragmented although it is
hoped that the European Defence Agency will begin to make a diff erence in
terms of supporting the more eff ective harmonisation of military requirements
and promoting a more open defence equipment market. Progress is being
made in opening project procurements to European competition and
addressing security of supply concerns, as outlined at A3.32 below. However,
at current spending levels the market cannot off er the same scale and scope as
the US market. Furthermore, European national defence markets are expected
to grow at lower rates allowing the US market to continue to pull ahead.

A3.17 Historically European governments owned and controlled much
of their indigenous supply base. In the post Cold War period there has been
a trend towards privatisation or partial privatisation of previously stateowned enterprises (e.g.MTU in Germany). This has resulted in a shift of
emphasis towards achievement of shareholder value rather than the delicate
balance previously sought between industrial performance and national
ambition and, as a result, is attracting interest from private equity investors.
Aff ordability constraints however are likely to force governments and
companies to tackle overcapacity of design and production in some sectors.

A3.18 Continental European companies, as well as securing their position
in domestic markets, are trying to access other markets and increase exports
to compensate for generally reducing or constant domestic budgets. The
UK defence budget has grown, but UK companies still generally are seeking
to secure a share of the larger and generally more profi table US market.
UK companies continue to invest in the USA, making a total of around £2
billion of US acquisitions in 2004 alone in almost forty separate acquisitions.
British companies such as BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, Smiths Group, VT and
QinetiQ have bought US companies to overcome the high entry barriers
and secure progressive access to the market. However, a continuing
commitment to the UK market combined with the constraints on accessing
and operating in the US market, forces diffi cult boardroom decisions for
UK companies on where to locate core capability and investment.

A3.19 This trend will continue as long as the US market is disproportionately
attractive in scale and relatively closed in comparison to other markets and as
long as entry costs remain justifi able from a shareholder value perspective.
Exports to the USA at the platform level are possible, as demonstrated by
the recent sale of the Agusta Westland US101 for the Presidential fl ight, but
a high level of US content is required. The fi nancial markets clearly currently
view the USA as delivering the best opportunities for shareholder value.

A3.20 The key question is whether investment into the USA is coming at
the expense of further investment in the UK market. The political environment
in the USA and recent trends do not suggest that technology sharing will get
signifi cantly easier in the near term, and the ease of sharing technology across
national boundaries can aff ect signifi cantly where companies choose to invest,
particularly in R&D. However, these problems, as well as cost competitiveness,
can also lead US companies to invest directly in the UK. For instance, Raytheon
Systems Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of the US Raytheon Company, now
employs 1500 people across the UK and, as well as engagement in a number
of UK projects, is a net exporter, including back to the USA. DTI estimates
that at present defence investment into the UK is exceeded by outward
investment from the UK into the US, but it is unclear whether this is likely
to be an ongoing trend, as the most attractive acquisition opportunities
are taken and as companies seek to integrate their recent acquisitions.


home market for product development and subsequently a sound
platform for exports. Our indigenous industry is broadly-based,
covering all environments and including civil-based information and
communications technologies (discussed further below). It also includes
enabling capabilities that add signifi cantly to eff ectiveness and value,
e.g.: propulsion, radars, power generation and management, platform
signature management, synthetic environments and training, electronic
warfare algorithms, and open architecture systems. Many of these enabling
subsystems are promoted and exported in their own right and have been
selected on merit by prime contractors in the USA and elsewhere.

A3.21 Companies based in continental Europe also look to achieve access
to other markets and improve their export success. Whilst UK companies
have been relatively successful in establishing trusted supplier credentials
in the USA, other European companies have had less success. Instead their
attention has been focused on accessing the UK market which is closer to
home, relatively open to foreign suppliers and shareholders and an attractive
extension from their home markets. Thales and Finmeccanica are examples of
foreign-owned companies who have successfully established signifi cant UK
market share, generally by acquisitions. Given the close defence relationship
with the US but also a central role in several pan-European defence equipment
programmes, the UK, as a base, can off er a bridge between Europe and the US.

A3.22 The UK defence market remains a considerable size in its own right,
as we will consider further below, and the Defence budget has benefi ted from
the longest period of sustained real growth in the UK’s defence spending plans
for over 20 years. In real terms, defence spending will be 7.5% higher than
1997/98 by 2007/08. In addition, the UK defence market has some defi ning
characteristics compared with other relevant national markets in terms of:

¬ sophistication of demand;
¬ market openness and diversity of supply;
¬ profi t potential and the trading environment.


A3.25 Whilst platform-related activity still shapes the UK defence
market, the fi gure A3(iii) shows that we already spend up to £9 billion
on support contracts with industry, covering logistics, maintenance,
repair and upgrade, IT enablers and facilities management; this
represents a very signifi cant proportion of overall external spend.

A3.26 **Through life management - The spending emphasis on support**
services is likely to persist. Our commitment to eff ective through-life
management of defence capabilities and assets to improve capability and
agility, enable technology insertion and reduce whole-life costs creates
opportunity for industry. Our Defence Logistics Organisation and its key
suppliers are already establishing innovative arrangements around key
programmes to move industry’s support role away solely from supply of
spares and maintenance services towards supply of asset availability and
incremental upgrade of capability. Similarly future programmes, such as
the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft, are being defi ned to address throughlife support as part of the initial acquisition process. This trend is set to
continue, with many of the processes and roles currently undertaken by
the MOD likely to be delivered in future through partnership with industry.
This requires the development of acquisition models that engage a range
of industrial players including equipment design authorities (e.g. aircraft
Original Equipment Manufacturers), technology inserters (such as defence
electronics companies), integrators of complex systems and/or military
capability integrators and innovators (e.g. niche technology companies).


A3.23 These characteristics defi ne its relative attractiveness to
industry, its ability to attract investment and the level of infl uence
or control UK Government can be confi dent of achieving in the
industrial base. Each aspect is discussed below highlighting the
current situation and identifying change drivers and trends.

**Sophistication of demand**


A3.24 We buy a wide range of defence products and services: from
basic items to complex integrated systems; from one-off purchases to
long term support services. The UK aims to maintain a capability edge
and must maintain adequate interoperability with US equipments,
particularly command and control systems. To achieve this we invest in
research and development to ensure we can remain at the forefront of

A3.27 **Focusing on Military Capability – The military strategic**
overview chapter outlined the emphasis on eff ects-based operations
and the need to plan and manage the defence business at the level of
“military capability” i.e. integrated and agile combinations of people
(appropriately trained and supported), equipments (appropriately updated
and maintained), infrastructure and information, and structures and
processes that can create military eff ect in a range of operational scenarios.

think more innovatively about the allocation of roles and responsibilities
and the use of commercial models to make best use of our and industry’s
comparative advantages in delivering and supporting military capability.

A3.28 **Market implications - Figure A3(iv) above**
shows that in practice this intent implies a continuation of
the rebalancing of roles that is already underway:

¬ In the past, industry’s role (shown in orange) was limited to
the provision of our equipments, upgrades and equipmentfocused support services. Our relationships with industry
were transactional. Industry’s share of the defence
budget was focused in the Equipment Programme;

¬ Now we are more explicitly dependent on industry for a wider
range of products and services. Industry roles extend into nonequipment areas and already span the boundary between
peacetime and deployed environments. Products and services
previously supplied separately are now being grouped into larger
integrated packages (including through-life, system-of-systems
and cross-platform) and industry now accesses the Equipment
Programme and a substantial portion of the Short Term Plan (STP);

¬ In the future, assuming this trend continues, an increasing

_7_ _OECD_


amount of the defence budget would be made accessible to
industry and the packaging up of diff erent elements of military
capability at the MOD/industry interface would continue. We
would retain core roles (shown in red) but become more explicitly
dependent on key suppliers for delivery of defence outcomes.
Any individual changes to the MOD/industry boundary are, of
course, likely to require consultation with Trade Unions and
demonstration of better value against a public sector comparator,
but the overall trend over the last few years is recognisable.

A3.29 **Increasing importance of Information & Communications**
**Technologies (ICT): Whereas the diff erentiator in military operations could**
previously be measured in terms of scale and potency, today it is more about agility
and the ability to create an appropriate military eff ect rapidly and in response to
specifi c information about the operational environment. Whereas technologies
such as stealth, advanced signal processing and energetic materials have generally
been defence-led and largely under the control of defence sectors, it is the
commercial sector that is driving innovation in ICT. Last year US businesses invested
more than £40 billion on ICT research and development alone, more than the entire
US Defence R&D budget[7].  To remain at the leading edge of military capability will,
therefore, increasingly require eff ective exploitation of commercially-driven ICT.

A3.30 Civil ICT is characterised by open international standards, fast
technology cycle-times and high levels of investment from the major
global players. A range of commercial supply models is used, normally
b d d hi h l i i i i i d


-----

Governments need to work with commercial developers and align with
their business models and development cycles if they are to access, exploit
or control the use of ICT technologies for defence purposes. This requires
the use of novel approaches, for example: activity at the Government
level to make the market attractive; commitment to COTS, common
standards and open architectures wherever possible; and encouraging
the core defence supply base to develop its ability to access new
technology and quickly assess and apply it in the defence environment.


A3.33 Continental European companies have taken opportunities in the UK
in their pursuit of alternative sources of growth to compensate for the lack of
scale and growth in their domestic markets. For example the Finmeccanica group
now owns signifi cant parts of the UK’s defence supply base, including helicopter
capability in Agusta Westland and the avionics/electronics capability in Selex.

A3.34 Large US companies participate more selectively in the UK market seeing
it as an optional extension to their activities in the USA. Their primary focus and
priority remains with the US market and DoD. However, they are able to leverage
the scale of their domestic production capabilities to compete favourably in the
UK market. The fi nancial and administrative barriers to US companies entering
the UK are lower than the costs associated with UK companies attempting
to build positions in the USA because of the diff erent approaches required to
establish entry. Generally, European companies have to acquire capability in the
USA to establish themselves in the US market; US companies tend to be able to
bring suffi cient capability into the UK to be considered a UK-based supplier.


###### A3


**Sophistication of demand – key implications**

Our demands on the industrial base are becoming more
sophisticated. We see an increasingly important role for
industry in delivering cost-eff ective military capability,
managed on a through-life basis; this provides signifi cant
opportunity for existing and new suppliers in the market.


We recognise the importance of accessing commerciallyled technology developments through engagement with
the broadest supply base, including companies who do not
traditionally specialise in defence. The DIS needs to support a
business environment that develops these relationships.


**Market openness and diversity of supply**

A3.31 As fi gure A3(v) illustrates, UK defence is a comparatively open market.
In 2004/05 some 5% of our spend with industry was directed at imports,
a further 14% with foreign-owned UK-based companies and a signifi cant
further proportion (13%) to cooperative programmes run through European
organisations such as NETMA and EUROPAAMS. Furthermore, a proportion of
our spend attributed at this level fl ows through to increasingly international
supply chains. In contrast, the USA spent less than 2% on imports and 7% with
foreign-owned companies, much of which was with BAE Systems North America.


A3.35 Figure A3(vi) provides a snapshot of our main suppliers
by listing the 10 largest direct suppliers in 2004/05.

A3.36 This chart only shows part of the picture. It is based on billing data
and therefore only refl ects our highest level direct spend with suppliers
and not the fl ow-down of that funding into the lower levels of the supply
base, which will often be international. It excludes all spend on the nuclear
programme and spend with major Government-owned suppliers such as Dstl.

A3.32 The principal continental European markets remain less open than the UK
in terms of foreign access to domestic markets, rules on foreign inward investment
into local companies and signifi cant retained shareholdings by some governments.
However, we are encouraging others to be similarly open, and the European Defence
Agency (EDA) is working to create an eff ective European Defence Equipment Market
(EDEM), in other words an open, competitive and transparent environment that
will strengthen the European defence technological and industrial base such that
our Armed Forces will be able to secure their equipment capability needs more
cost eff ectively. The voluntary Code of Conduct on Defence Procurement[8] which
applies to those defence equipment procurements exempted from the EC public
procurement rules on national security grounds[9] is a signifi cant step in this direction,
supporting long held UK policy aims for more open defence equipment markets
achieved through a self-regulatory approach, and off ering UK industry the potential

A3.37 The chart shows a snapshot in time and our suppliers change
with major programmes. For example General Dynamics UK’s prominence
in 2004/05 was highly dependent on the Bowman programme. Looking
forward, the profi le is likely to change with new programmes suggesting
enhanced roles for a number of foreign-owned companies, including EADS
(Skynet 5, Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft), EDS (Defence Information
Infrastructure), Raytheon (ASTOR) and Thales (Watchkeeper).

decisions around capability development and investment, especially
where other governments maintain stakes in these companies.

A3.41 For those major UK defence companies who are developing
signifi cant business overseas, notably in the US, our relative importance
is decreasing, although we are likely to remain signifi cant whilst the UK is
seen as the principal home market and we are seen as a major customer.


A3.42 Another factor aff ecting the level of our infl uence is the degree
to which companies are focused on defence or civil markets. The major
prime contractors are generally, by nature, defence companies and must
remain focused on defence markets. They may have adjacent businesses
in the civil sector, for example defence and civil aerospace interests,
but these are largely driven by diff erent business models. Further
down the supply chain there is more scope for leveraging common
technology and capability between civil and defence sides of the business
and some businesses have highly diversifi ed and often international
portfolios. In these cases our direct infl uence is more limited and we
need to ensure that the UK, and the UK defence market specifi cally, is
suffi ciently attractive to these companies as a place to do business.

A3.43 The degree to which we procure from companies with interests
beyond UK defence varies sector by sector. Across the environments MOD
is dependent on companies of all types and sizes. Whilst our focus is often
drawn to the large companies because of their overall importance in terms
of scale and breadth and their visibility, we have to understand the role
played by smaller companies, whether as part of a supply chain or as niche
players. Some of these companies have specialist capabilities that are critical
to our ability to act responsively and fl exibly, for example in response to
Urgent Operational Requirements. Whereas small companies in supply
chains tend to have their primary relationship with their industrial clients,
some of the specialist companies also have direct relationships with MOD.
There is often a high degree of interdependency, with MOD dependent
on a single source for a particular capability and the company highly
dependent on MOD as a major customer. We should therefore be able to work
eff ectively with these companies to identify and secure core capability.

A3.38 Despite these caveats, it is clear that the UK has a diverse supply base
even at the highest level. Several of the key suppliers are under foreign control
at Group level or have a signifi cant element of international ownership or
control. The DTI estimates that around 25% of the UK’s defence industrial base is
foreign owned[10] . Furthermore several of our biggest suppliers are more heavily
focused on non-defence or international business than on UK defence business.

A3.39 The level of infl uence we can expect to have with companies is
determined by the importance of the UK defence market to the company’s
revenue and profi t lines and the importance of engagement in the UK defence
market as a means to access and develop new technology and capability.

A3.40 As our supply base becomes increasingly international, our
infl uence is, other things being equal, likely to decrease. Foreignowned companies operating in the UK market are generally less
critically dependent on us as a customer than on their home customer.

limited infl uence over these companies and in particular over strategic

**Market analysis and diversity of**
**supply – key implications**

We are dependent on a diverse supply base. Some suppliers are
focused on UK defence and highly dependent on us. With these
companies we can expect to have a high level of infl uence. Many
others have diversifi ed businesses, operating in the UK and overseas,
in defence and civil markets; we will have less direct infl uence with
these companies but can encourage them to participate in the UK
defence market using a range of levers identifi ed later in this section.


###### A3


A3.45 In the maritime environment, the equipment and support primes are
generally defence-dependent while the sub-system and component supply
base is highly diversifi ed. The anticipated spike in the new-build workload,
due to programmes including Type 45 and CVF, will pose considerable
challenges for the prime contractors, while the extended supply base is
expected to cope reasonably well with changes in anticipated work levels.

**������������������������������** **������������������������������������������**
**������������** **�������������**


such as technology initiatives and high risk contracts, including fi xed price
contracts, benefi t from signifi cantly higher margins. The approach across
the rest of Europe is however largely comparable to that of the UK.

A3.49 **Acquisition models. The selection of acquisition models**
may also have signifi canct infl uence. The traditional approach in the
UK has tended towards tight defi nition of the scope of work, the use of
competition to select suppliers, negotiation targeted at reducing our
risk and cost, and then a transactional approach to management of
the contract, holding suppliers to account against agreed milestones.
More recently we have recognised that a “one-size-fi ts-all” approach to
engagement with our key suppliers is not optimal and have deployed
a wider range of supply models. The principles of partnering are now
in general well understood and deployed successfully in some areas to
provide mutual benefi t to us and our suppliers. In the Defence Procurement
Agency, several new contractual models are being deployed on signifi cant
programmes, including the use of alliances and lead systems integrators.


A3.50 **Risk/reward profi les. Both sides recognise the need for work**
to optimise the approach to risk and reward. Currently industry perceives
high levels of risk in our acquisition business, though their own project
performance against fi rm or fi xed price contracts is also a key determinant
of profi tability. Long timescales mean that a whole range of factors change
during the lifetime of a programme or even a decision-making cycle,
introducing risk including cancellation, requirements change, funding
changes and delays. Partnering relationships, designed for mutual benefi t,
that recognise that risk is shared and reward performance, are more attractive
to industry. The UK has a history of leading the way in deploying innovative
acquisition and fi nancing models in defence, for example PFI and PPP,
and continuing to develop experience in these areas will allow us and our
key suppliers to provide us with better value capability, more consistency
and clarity and hence less risk, and better profi t returns to industry.

A3.51 **Approach to R&D. A government’s approach to defence R&D**
is a critical factor determining the risk profi le for industry. UK spend
on R&D is signifi cant in global terms as shown below, although US
spending continues to dwarf even the combined resources of Europe.

**Profi t potential and the trading environment**

A3.47 Corporate performance is directly aff ected by available profi t margins,
the selection of business models and associated contracting mechanisms, the
risk/reward profi le achievable within these and the approach of Government
to other aspects of defence business development, such as R&D and exports.

A3.52 In 2003, the USA invested £29billion (0.6% GDP) in Defence
R&D compared with the UK’s £2.3billion (0.2% GDP). The US R&D
budget was 5 times that of EU countries combined (£5.5billion). This
refl ects a US approach to reducing risk in the early stages of defence
capability development that is very attractive to defence companies and
investors. Whereas the UK and other European nations often insist on

programmes, the US tendency is to use cost-plus arrangements until the
risk is quantifi ed and manageable. Beyond the use of R&D to de-risk and
mature technology associated with specifi c programmes, funding is also
used to drive innovation. Chapter A10 addresses this in more detail.

A3.53 **Exports. Exports are an important part of the defence economic**
landscape, off ering higher profi t margins than domestic sales (because
development costs are already amortised) and, therefore, reducing the
overall cost of a nation’s defence capability procured from its indigenous
suppliers. UK companies continue to consolidate Britain’s position as
the second largest defence exporter, with a 20% share of the global
market, despite reduced defence spending in many countries and
increasing competition from traditional and newer supplier nations.

**_Figure A3(xii)._**

A3.57 Figure A3(xii) shows fi ve groupings of levers that can be used to achieve
required defence industrial outcomes. There are three groups of levers available
to governments through their execution of day-to-day business, namely:

A3.58 **Government as Investor – Whilst much of governmental investment**
in research and technology exists to support intelligent customer status,
some is also intended to secure appropriate technology and innovation in the
industrial base. Careful deployment of a range of investment levers can support
technology development in critical parts of industry. Furthermore, governments’
approaches to R&D are an important factor in determining the overall
attractiveness of the defence market because it impacts on risk and profi tability.


A3.56 Governments have a range of levers with which to respond, and
these take many forms. Some are available through day-to-day activities,
for example as a customer of defence products and services (though here
too, other government departments may have a role as customers, such as
for equipment required for both defence and civil emergency services, or for
secure communications). Others come from governments’ wider investments
in the well-being of industry and some through governments’ authority as
a controller or regulator (including potentially a de-regulator) of industry.

**Profi t potential and the trading**
**environment – key implications**

A number of factors drive profi tability for companies engaged
in our business, including uneven project performance. The
DIS provides an opportunity to create a more attractive trading
environment that enables industry to maximise profi ts whilst still
retaining the focus on delivery of cost-eff ective capability to us.


**Levers Government can use to shape the business**
**environment for defence companies and investors**

A3.55 As earlier sections have described, we need certain features in the
industrial base, namely:

¬ a market that is suffi ciently attractive to retain companies’
participation against the pull of other foreign or adjacent markets;
¬ industrial delivery: eff ectiveness and effi ciency;
¬ innovation and technology/capability development in industry;
¬ suffi cient control for Government to ensure appropriate sovereignty.


-----

A3.59 **Government as Planner – governments’ forward planning activity,**
at the strategic and business level and addressing military capability, equipment
investment and business operations can provide industry with a level of
future market understanding that underpins business strategy and corporate
investment. Joint planning approaches take this a stage further, providing
planned alignment and interdependency between us and our key suppliers.

A3.60 **Government as Customer – The approach taken to**
acquiring defence products and services - from the acquisition model
chosen to the selection of suppliers and the profi t margins available

- fundamentally defi nes the attractiveness of the defence market.


A3.68 Diff erent governments choose to deploy diff erent sets of these
levers; for instance, in some European countries the State continues to take
signifi cant stakes in their domestic defence industry, and control executive
appointments. In the next chapter, we explore in more detail how the UK
Government deploys these levers to diff erentiate the UK market and make it
an attractive place for investors and workers to build defence companies.


A3.66 Each of these categories has within it a range of specifi c
actions that can be taken to produce an eff ect. For example ‘R&T
support’ covers a range of intervention options, from working with
commercial suppliers of ICT to infl uence their future products ranges
to direct funding of research or acquisition of specifi c IPR.

A3.67 Some of the levers are intended to infl uence the environment
and can be applied at a general level. Others are intended to
achieve a very particular eff ect and must be highly targeted.


###### A3


A3.61 Beyond these levers, there are others available
to governments in two general categories:

A3.62 **Government as Supporter of industry – A range of levers,**
both fi nancial and activity-based, are available to provide support in a
number of forms to industry. In the UK, ownership of these levers is vested
across Government, notably in the MOD, DTI and HM Treasury, and also in
the UK’s Regional Development Agencies and Devolved Administrations.


**There are some key principles the Government**
**will deploy in selecting and deploying levers:**

¬ In general it is better to use levers that infl uence
the environment or the way we in general
interact with it, rather than case-by-case specifi c
interventions; this is more benefi cial to all parties
and limits the risk of unintended consequences.


¬ Levers must be applied within the context of
defi ned sector and capability strategies.

¬ Impact must be assessed thoroughly before introduction.


¬ Specifi c interventions must be targeted,
contained and time-bounded.


A3.63 Government as Regulator of industry – on occasion, governments
may need to exploit levers more concerned with controlling or restraining
parts of industry to ensure access to, or control over, key IPR, capability
and capacity. Equally, governments can consider where regulations can
be relaxed or removed, to increase industry’s profi tability and agility.

A3.64 Levers that aff ect the way governments execute their core business are the
most attractive because they impact directly on defence eff ectiveness and relate to
core processes and specifi c lines of activity or programmes. They also fundamentally
determine the attractiveness of the domestic defence business to industry.


A3.65 Secondary interventions can be aimed at
further enabling a government’s ability to:

¬ stimulate the overall health of the defence industry by reducing
barriers to entry, encouraging participation, stimulating
industry investment and stimulating technology transfer from
international defence sources of adjacent industrial sectors;


¬ guarantee access to and control over critical technologies
and capabilities where these underpin critical military
capability and operational sovereignty.

###### The UK business environment
### A4


###### Introduction

A4.1 Chapter A3 described the general shape of the evolving
global defence market, and introduced the general framework of
levers available to Government to infl uence it. This chapter illustrates
some of the ways in which the Government, within this framework,
seeks to continue to make the UK a attractive place to establish,
grow and invest in high-technology defence businesses.

A4.2 Some of the ‘levers’ are in fact natural consequences of broader
Government activity, for instance stewardship of the economy. Indeed,
indirect levers are generally to be preferred, as they apply to all businesses
and run the least risk of distorting the allocation of resources. However,
while defence is becoming more international, it is far from a normally
functioning market, possessing a number of characteristics which,
taken together, diff erentiate it from other areas of manufacturing:

¬ national security considerations;
¬ few suppliers, very few legal customers;
¬ high levels of technological and scientifi c intensity;
¬ the central role of Governments as sponsor,
principal customer and market gatekeeper;
¬ to diff erent extents in diff erent countries, legal and
political restrictions on company ownership.

A4.3 All of these can aff ect how investors view the sector. For
instance, investors are likely to require a premium where they believe
Governments will intervene to secure political, rather than commercial,
priorities. On the other hand, the signifi cance of the home customer means
that, if investors have confi dence in the consistency and credibility of a
government’s approach to the industry, the market may be less volatile.

###### The UK business environment
### A4


A4.4 These characteristics have generally resulted in a split between
a series of ‘homeland’ domestic markets with some international
interaction, and ‘export’ markets for those countries without a signifi cant
defence industrial base of their own. Some sections of the supply base
do however operate on a genuinely international basis. In addition,
major defence programmes frequently have characteristics similar
to the civil aerospace and other technology-intensive sectors:

¬ high cost and high risk projects;
¬ high value, low volume products;
¬ international collaboration in design and development;
¬ high barriers to entry;
¬ issues around safety critically, long-service
lives and hence obsolescence.

A4.5 The market is also in general characterised by a signifi cant
element of advocacy from fi rms and other governments attempting to
infl uence high value or high prestige equipment procurement decisions.

A4.6 Around 165,000 people are directly employed in defence
manufacturing in the UK, with a further 135,000 people employed
indirectly in supply chain activity[1].  DTI estimates that the average
labour productivity is £55,000 value added per employee, contributing
nearly 0.5% to GDP. It is a technologically intensive business, and an
important part of the manufacturing sector which is a priority area
for Government. There is widespread acceptance that the UK cannot
compete on low wage activity, nor should it seek to do so. The future of
UK manufacturing therefore depends on continually moving up the value
chain by raising investment, R&D, skills and productivity, and Defence and
the UK’s manufacturing interests are closely aligned in this respect.

###### Government as an investor

A4.7 Investment in defence-related technology is critical to retaining
access to cutting-edge military capability, and the next chapter discusses in
detail the MOD’s research & technology activities. This however fi ts within
a broader framework of Government support to science, technology and
innovation. The Government’s target is to raise the overall level of research
and development (R&D) investment in the UK from its current level of
1.9% of GDP to 2.5% by 2014, and our approach to this is described in the
Government’s ten year Science and Innovation Investment Framework
published in July 2004, and the work coordinated by the business-led
**Technology Strategy Board (TSB) which aims to support the pull-through**
of ideas emerging from the UK’s world class science and engineering base.
The fi rst annual TSB report[2] explains the vision behind the Technology
Strategy: for the UK to be seen as a global leader in innovation and
a magnet for technology-intensive companies. This also takes into

account existing national strategies, for example, the aerospace research
priorities identifi ed by the National Aerospace Technology Srategy taking
forward the work of the Aerospace Innovation and Growth Team[3].

A4.8 Some £370 million will be available to business between 2005 and 2008
as research grants, via the DTI’s Research Calls, to undertake collaborative research
in technologies important to the growth of the UK economy. The Government
also invests more broadly in the UK science, engineering and technology base,
from which the defence industry benefi ts; for instance, between 1997 and
2007 the science budget will have more than doubled, rising to £3.4 billion.


¬ **promoting inward and regional investment: as well as**
marketing the attractions of the UK as a place to invest, grants
may be available from the RDAs in England and the devolved
administrations for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to
cover a proportion of eligible costs for businesses planning to
start up operations, and UK Trade & Investment, a joint DTI-FCO
organisation, handle applications in the fi rst instance. Regional
support is also provided by way of Selective Finance for Investment
in England, which allows RDAs or DTI to consider paying some of
the capital investment costs for companies in an EU assisted area[4].
In many cases, similar schemes are off ered by the appropriate
organisations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland;

¬ providing active support to exports, including through the
Export Credits Guarantee Department and, specifi cally for the
defence industry, the Defence Export Services Organisation,
as well as political support to specifi c export campaigns;


###### A4


A4.9 The MOD is also working closely with DTI and other government
departments to develop Innovation Platforms where central Government,
Research Councils, Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) and Devolved
Administrations, business and the science base can work together to use a
range of technologies and policy levers to deliver innovative products and
services for which there is both a strong policy need and a potentially large
global market. Network Security has been defi ned as one of the pilots for this.

**_Hand assembly soldering © Raytheon._**


¬ encouraging innovation through fi scal incentives, e.g. the
R&D tax credit[5], a company tax relief that can either reduce
a business’ tax bill, or for some SMEs, provide a cash sum;

¬ the Manufacturing Strategy, updated in 2004, and the
Manufacturing Forum – jointly chaired by the Minister for Industry
and a senior industrialist, with a two-year remit to deliver practical
actions to improve manufacturing in the UK. The Government
provides this support in recognition that high value exports benefi t
the UK economy. Manufacturing exports, to which the defence
industry is a major contributor, account for two thirds of all exports;


###### Government as supporter

A4.10 The Government has a broad range of levers in this area, which can
signifi cantly contribute to making the UK attractive to investors in defence
and more generally. Some aff ect long-term characteristics of the UK economy,
and government can only attempt over time to infl uence these. However, in
general, Government assists in producing an attractive environment through:


¬ maintaining a stable macro-economic and political environment;

¬ supporting the education and science base, as mentioned
above, to maintain a highly-skilled workforce, in
conjunction with industry’s own investment;


¬ more general support to business; e.g. the DTI runs a number of
**business support schemes that may be suitable for defence**
companies. It also off ers fl exible products from its business
support portfolio aimed at SMEs, including the Small Firms
Loan Guarantee Scheme, Support to Implement Best Business
Practice, Grants for Research and Development, and Grants
for Investigating an Innovative Idea (reimbursing consultancy
costs for advice on how to exploit an innovative idea).

_4 The level of grant available is determined on a case-by-case basis,_
_linked to the quantity and quality of jobs created or sustained._
_5 Introduced for SMEs in 2000 and extended to large fi rms in_
_2002; SMEs have to date received £778 million and the large_
_company credit is worth some £400 million each year._
_6 Funding is split equally between the DTI and RDAs, and £34 million_
_h_ _b_ _i_ _di_ _lb_ _2005_ _d2008_


¬ support to defence-applicable skills. For instance, the Education
Secretary and Trade & Industry Secretary announced on 31 October
2005 a Manufacturing Skills Academy, to open by September
2006, creating a single point of access to deliver globally competitive
skills for UK manufacturing. In addition, the Government is working
with Science, Engineering and Manufacturing Technologies Alliance
(SEMTA), a sector skills council, which has launched a Sector
**Skills Agreement for Aerospace, together with a costed action**
plan that will be funded from both public and private sources. A
similar agreement for Marine industries is expected in early 2006;

¬ providing the Manufacturing Advisory Service, aimed
primarily but not exclusively at SMEs, to provide diagnostics
and advice through regional centres of manufacturing
excellence[6]. The Service has helped companies generate
an additional £188 million in value added since 2002;


¬ supporting an education and business environment which also
produces strong support industries for defence, particularly
in fi nance, business services, design and marketing;


¬ keeping down the costs of setting up and running businesses
– e.g. at 30% the UK has one of the lowest main corporate tax
rates of the world’s major economies, and the cost of setting
up a business is low and the process straightforward;

A4.11 Government could also act as a supporter in situations where,
for example, the adjustment costs from defence restructuring fell
disproportionately upon a particular region of the country. However,
that assistance would be best addressed through regional policy
and targeted assistance, such as retraining programmes, rather
than through the distortion of defence procurement decisions.

**_Weapon interfacing electronics © Ultra._**

A4.12 We noted in this list encouragement of inward investment. We
recognise the very positive contribution made by some fi rms in developing
the UK defence industrial base, and although other nations do not operate as
open a market (for either investment or procurement) as we do, we do not
believe that further protection for the UK market is the answer. However, we
will continue to work with individual companies where they identify that they
are being prevented from making the acquisitions they want overseas, and
more generally seek to open up other markets which remain heavily protected.

###### Government as regulator

A4.13 Government, as a regulator and de-regulator, can have very
signifi cant direct impact on the business environment – and the
potential distorting eff ects of changes to regulation need to be carefully
assessed. However, there are specifi c controls in place.

A4.14 In particular, the Government has a range of instruments to
regulate acquisitions and mergers to ensure fair markets and security
of supply. Merger policy in the UK is regulated under the Enterprise Act
2002, which came into force on 1 May 2004, and the EC Mergers Directive
04/139. The Enterprise Act eff ectively took politics out of merger decisions,
leaving the Offi ce of Fair Trading (‘OFT’) and the Competition Commission
to take decisions as the independent competition authorities[7]. The Act
allows the OFT to refer any merger to the Competition Commission if
it believes that a lessening of competition would result in any given
market within the UK (or any part of the UK), require undertakings
without reference or accept the merger without reference.

A4.15 The Enterprise Act also allows the Secretary of State for Trade
and Industry to intervene on public interest grounds, including national

_7 The OFT will investigate competition issues of mergers where the annual_
_turnover of the enterprise being merged/acquired is greater than £70M,_
_or if the merger/acquisition will result in a share of any given market or_
_markets of 25% or more. Mergers involving two or more member states_
_in the EU, and with turnover in excess of 5 billion Euros, come under the_
_jurisdiction of the European Commission under the EC Mergers Directive._
_However, the OFT retains the role as the competent authority in the UK by_
_li i i_ _i h h EUC_ _i i_ _h f ll_ _d i j i di i_


security. In such cases, Government often seeks undertakings from
acquiring companies on retaining defence capabilities in the UK. In
addition the Government holds special shares in BAE Systems and RollsRoyce in order to protect some vital defence industrial capabilities.

A4.16 Other aspects of regulation include the setting and enforcement of
strategic export controls, discussed in chapter A6; the MOD’s policy towards
Intellectual Property; and requirements for the vetting or nationality of
individuals within business before they can receive sensitive information. In
some cases, this applies at the company level – cf. List X, as discussed in the
Counter Terrorism Chapter. It also includes the Government’s approach to the
labour market, where the UK’s regulations are the most fl exible in Europe.

###### Government as a customer

A4.17 How MOD behaves as a customer is most probably the critical
factor in making the defence industry attractive to investors and workers.
Much of this document sets out how we aim to align our and industry’s
behaviours and processes, in order to ensure the capability requirements of
the Armed Forces can be met, now and in the future. In particular, we can:

¬ increasingly accept COTS technology, standards, architectures,
products or services, and use open standards and architectures,
wherever security considerations permit, to reduce cost to MOD,
limit the risk of obsolescence, extend the market for industry,
and open it to the widest range of suppliers possible;

¬ consistently act with a view to through-life capability management
and take into account the need to sustain sovereign capabilities;

¬ select acquisition models depending on the specifi c circumstances,
to deliver the best long-term value for money. This includes
promoting a sustainable industry that secures onshore the industrial
capabilities we require to maintain appropriate sovereignty.

A4.18 The continuing changes needed to deliver this approach
are summarised in Part C. However, it is also important to recognise
that in some areas the relevant industry is broader than Defence, and
includes for instance the ‘blue-light’ services and other Departments
and Agencies. The Government is keen to promote the spread of best
practice across Government and the development of coherent approaches
to procurement, and DIS is one part of this. For example, we recognise
in this strategy the need to work more closely with other Departments
and Agencies to produce sustainable high-grade cryptographic industrial
capabilities in the UK, including by considering the amalgamated
demand across Government for cryptographic products and services.

###### Government as planner

A4.19 As chapter A3 described, we are dependent on suppliers with very
diff erent characteristics for the supply of defence products and services. Some
serve us alongside a range of wider civil and overseas markets; others are
highly dependent on the domestic defence market. Our actions as planners
can however help encourage these suppliers to remain eff ective and effi cient,
with most improvement likely where companies both have the resources to
engage in strategic planning, and have signifi cant potential or actual business
with the MOD relative to other customers. Nevertheless, focusing solely on
such suppliers would risk discouraging new entrants or limiting competition.

A4.20 We explain in more detail in Chapter A8 how we intend to
**make as much information available to industry as possible,**
ranging from publishing information on equipment projects annually,
d j i l i i i h hi i i bl d li

substantial benefi ts on both sides without excluding other companies
inappropriately. We are also, with this strategy, publishing a guide to
make clearer for industry who does what within the MOD and who
therefore is empowered and able to speak authoritatively to industry
on particular topics. In sum, we plan to move substantially to a more
open and consistent face towards industry. In return, we expect industry
to treat such discussions in a mature way, respecting our confi dences and
committing to a mutual sharing of information where this is appropriate.

A4.21 In addition, in this strategy we identify the industrial
capabilities we wish to retain onshore for national security reasons.
Where these may be at risk, we will work together with industry to
investigate sustainment strategies. Some other nations are taking
similar approaches. We believe that this strategy will nevertheless be
distinctive, by being endorsed across Government, and set against a
hard-headed assessment of the current industrial reality, recognising that
in some cases while we would like to maintain an onshore capability,
it will not be possible to do so unless industry works with us to address
serious issues about its current sustainability and productivity.


¬ **specifi c support to the Defence industry, including**
the Defence Export Services Organisation (DESO);

¬ increasing sharing of information to allow industry
to plan with confi dence and to attract investment;


###### A4


¬ through this DIS, a clear articulation of those capabilities
**we wish to retain onshore, alongside clear assessments**
of what needs to change if these are to be sustainable,
including through further joint work with industry.

A4.23 The Government believes this amounts to a unique,
distinctive and attractive environment for the defence industry. If
the opportunities are grasped and the challenges tackled, we believe
the UK defence industry (which will continue to include foreignowned companies) off ers the chance of long-term prosperity, focused
on delivering the high-value products the Armed Forces need.


###### Conclusions

A4.22 This and the preceding chapter have discussed the global and domestic
defence industrial landscape, and how the Government supports a business
environment that makes the UK an attractive place for the defence industry. In sum:


¬ **a greater proportion of our overall business is available**
**to industry than in any other major defence nation, and**
growing expertise in the combination of systems engineering
expertise, agility and supply chain management required
to deliver through-life capability management gives
the UK defence industry a comparative advantage;

¬ a sophisticated demand for high-value products which have
to stand up to active service, and which then, having been
proven in this way, are easier to market to export customers;


¬ an open market and diversity of suppliers which encourages
innovation, new entrants (including in information and
communications technologies) and inward investment;

¬ we are open to new procurement models, including long-term
partnerships, which incentivise industry to drive down costs but
allow increased profi ts for good performance and delivery;


¬ in addition, as a customer, supporter, regulator, investor
and planner, the Government helps sustain an attractive
**overall business environment, including:**

¬ **a stable macro-economic and political environment;**


¬ leadership in science & technology and manufacturing;

¬ **low costs (including low corporate tax rates, and business-**
friendly regulation including fl exible labour laws);


¬ strong support industries in fi nance, business
services, design and marketing;

¬ a highly skilled and fl exible labour force;

###### Defence research technology and innovation
### A5


###### In order to meet the challenges of the future we must be able to derive the full benefi ts of advancing technology’[1]

**_New Generation Service Respirator._**

###### Introduction

A5.1 Defence is underpinned by increasingly sophisticated technologies[2]
and the UK’s battle winning military capability remains heavily dependent on
the development, exploitation and insertion of world-class technology. UK
Government, industry and university research and technology (R&T) eff ort
remains critical at a time of uncertain threats, as illustrated by the diverse tasks
demanded of our Armed Forces since the end of the Cold War. Although the
nature of confl ict remains dirty, dangerous and deeply personal often with no
substitute for ‘boots on the ground’, the UK needs to stay ahead in technology
against both conventional and novel threats, such that we can quickly develop
counter measures and solutions as new threats emerge. A strong and innovative
science and engineering base in UK Government research agencies, industry and
universities is essential to meet this need. A fundamental task is the identifi cation
of the key technologies in which the UK should retain an international lead, due to
their signifi cance both to sovereignty and to the competitiveness of our defence
industrial base. Tackling this task is made easier if we have a clear understanding of
our current defence technology strengths as compared to international standards.

###### R&T investment is critical to the delivery of battle winning capability

A5.2 Well targeted investment in R&T is a critical enabler of our
national defence capability; it strengthens innovation in our defence
industry, produces more capable equipment for our forces and
underpins our ability to operate with high technology allies like the US
or France and lead an ad hoc coalition (e.g. of European nations).


###### Defence research technology and innovation
### A5


A5.3 Technology is a key driver for change in the modern world and
is crucial to network enabled, adaptable and rapidly deployable forces.
Technology is one of the drivers of productivity and underpins much of the
UK’s productivity and success in the past few decades. This is recognised
by the creation of a 10 year R&T UK Government strategy[3] to raise
public and private sector investment in R&T. The results of Government
R&T are often transferred into industry or carried out under contract by
industry or universities. It aims to drive innovation in the UK, thereby
generating greater capability for our forces. Improving equipment quality
will also have a positive eff ect on UK defence export performance.


A5.4 The MOD and its partners must continue to meet the needs
of the Armed Forces and should therefore focus attention on:

¬ technology that can and should be inserted into future
capabilities, directly improving the delivery of military eff ect;

¬ technology that will enhance the delivery of
capability and decision making;

¬ scientifi c/technological advances in which the UK
Defence needs to sustain a suitable level of capability
in order to act as an intelligent customer;

¬ technology judged to be of emerging relevance to defence;


**Benefi ts R&T investment has**
**brought to military capability**

¬ thermal imagers/night vision goggles giving
night time combat advantage to our forces;

¬ Chobham armour, a key factor in the success of US
and UK forces in both Gulf confl icts, off ers the best
armoured fi ghting vehicle protection available;

¬ sonar 2193, which has greatly enhanced the ability of
the navy to detect traditional and stealthy mines;

¬ technologies to detect and counter terrorist use of explosive
devices, such as the Carver remote controlled robot;

¬ the fl ight propulsion control system to make carrier
landings easier for the Joint Strike Fighter;

¬ stealthy materials such as tiles for acoustic
stealth on our nuclear submarines;

¬ better respirators, detectors and improved vaccines to
protect our troops from chemical and biological attack.

A5.5 It is important to ensure that we have skilled R&T staff
embedded in and supporting the acquisition process from start to fi nish,
making the best decisions and choices with the resources available, and
therefore ensuring the eff ective delivery of battle winning capability.


A5.7 The international environment in which technology based (defence
and civil) industries compete is evolving rapidly. Many nations with growing
economic wealth, such as China and India, are now investing heavily in
R&T. Although UK investment in R&T has risen in cash terms, it fell as a
proportion of GDP from 2.3% of GDP in 1981 to 1.9% now. There exists
a risk that in the coming decades the UK could fall behind both our key
allies and emerging economies in our ability to support sophisticated and
competitive technology based industries. We could become increasingly
dependent on defence technology solutions generated by other countries,
including those developed from civil applications. This is of less concern
when these are our allies, but a growing reliance on products such as
electronic components from other regions of the world could be a source
for concern in the future. Nevertheless, the UK remains a world leader in
some areas; UK’s aerospace and pharmaceutical industries in particular
are among the strongest in the world, with aerospace accounting for
15% of all business enterprise research and development in 2004[4].

A5.8 A recent MOD-sponsored study analysing 11 major defence capable
nations has uncovered a highly signifi cant correlation between equipment
capability and R&T[5] investment in the last 5-30 years as shown in Figure
A5(i). It shows that there is a simple ‘you get what you pay for’ relationship
between R&T spend and equipment quality, with a sharp law of diminishing
returns, and that R&T investment buys a time advantage over open market
equipment. The UK is currently in a relatively good position, refl ecting a
high R&T expenditure in the past but the gap with the USA is growing, which
may aff ect UK/US interoperability. China is expected to grow rapidly to an
estimated R&T expenditure level equivalent to the UK by around 2020.

**Defence R&T is vital to:**

¬ meet defence challenges;
¬ deliver cost-eff ective military capability;
¬ counter new or emerging threats;
¬ enable eff ective acquisition processes;
¬ support national competitiveness.


###### Challenges facing R&T in enabling military eff ect

A5.6 Current and future threats may increasingly involve
the use of asymmetric tactics, requiring the MOD and industry
to retain fl exibility and the required technological advantage
to overcome these threats. This is compounded by:


¬ the proliferation of technologically advanced systems,
readily available on the open market that can greatly
enhance the military eff ect that can be achieved;

¬ chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear
materials and expertise proliferation;

**_Figure A5(i) – Capability Advantage from R&D Investment._**

A5.9 In order to maintain appropriate equipment quality (and hence
military capability) sustained and targeted investment in MOD and
industry R&T funding remains important. Focused R&T also provides
battle winning capability by supporting other important activities
across the MOD. These include the analysis of intelligence, current and
future threat analysis, operational analysis of future force structure
plans, policy formulation and equipment acquisition decisions.


A5.10 Giving our Armed Forces their critical edge has always been heavily
dependent on the development, exploitation and insertion of world-class
technology. This has traditionally been through MOD funded and conducted
R&T, but recent years have seen the migration of part of this work to the

private sector. The future will demand a balance of continuing MOD and
industry R&T in key and emerging areas. Military off the shelf (MOTS) and,
where appropriate, commercially off the shelf (COTS) solutions can contribute
to meeting capability challenges, but cannot be the complete answer.

A5.11 There will be an enduring need for MOD R&T expertise to
support all aspects of defence capability and equipment acquisition,
ownership and deployment. We need to rapidly prototype technologies
for insertion into capability and understand how logistics and equipment
support can be made more effi cient and eff ective through the use of
technology. Through all of this, the increased use of experimentation
and demonstration should enable us to determine how best to meet
these challenges. To achieve this we need to assess technology,
conduct analysis and integration, improve the acceptance process and
through life support process, including obsolescence management.

A5.12 The in-service life expectancy of major platforms is increasing.
New equipment and systems need to be even more fl exible to meet
unpredictable demands, adaptable to ensure connectivity in a network
enabled world, and capable of regular upgrade. We must fi nd ways to
exploit the global market and insert technology into military capability
to keep up with the high rate of refresh within many sectors.

A5.13 MOD, in collaboration with the UK Council for e-Business (UKCeB)
is undertaking a number of R&T projects aimed at establishing shared
information environments with industry. Recognising that many of
the major platform projects are multinational, the Transatlantic Secure
Collaboration Programme (TSCP) is focussed on providing a framework
for electronic collaboration that meets national and business constraints
on information sharing. Initially providing a secure mail capability,
the programmes goal is to provide a secure federated computing
environment that can be applied to a wide range of projects.

A5.14 There is also a need for a better understanding of the
human factors that determine information assimilation and
subsequent action, and the need to design information networks
across diff erent components of military capability.


###### The way ahead

**Responding to the challenges**

A5.15 We have seen that Defence R&T investment is a critical enabler
for military capability and the competitiveness of our defence industry. It
also impacts on defence sales and the UK economy via the spin out of civil
technology companies arising from defence R&T spend[31]. Employment and
training opportunities in high-technology also provides broad support to
wealth creation in the UK. We have recognised that the environment we
operate in has changed. Industrialised nations remain very strong in the
fi eld of R&T, but developing nations are investing signifi cantly, with civil
sector research leading in some dual use areas, specifi cally ICT. In addition,
the nature of the threat has changed and we can expect opponents to
use MOTS and COTS systems (often combined) to challenge us and our
interests. In this new environment, we will have to horizon-scan eff ectively
technology advances (both threats and opportunities) and to access and
exploit the best technology to give the UK Armed Forces the military
capability required. In order to move forward, there are several areas that
we need to address, including how we maintain our capability, how we
access technology for exploitation to meet our requirements, and how
to improve the way in which we conduct acquisition and exploitation.

**Setting and aligning national defence R&T priorities**

A5.16 In Part B of this strategy an analysis of the cross-cutting
technical priorities for defence capability identifi es those areas in which
the UK needs to sustain or develop technological strength; there are
areas of technologies with emerging defence relevance, which we
need to watch. And we also need to look at where the convergence
of key technology fi elds like ICT, life sciences and nanotechnology
might create new threats or capabilities with defence relevance.

A5.17 The majority of MOD’s research programme is broadly aligned
with the Department’s needs. However, we must ensure that our
future research programme remains strongly aligned and is able
to address rapidly the changing defence and security situation. We
will ensure that our Defence Technology Strategy (DTS) continues
to be aligned with defence policy and capability requirements.
We will work with industry and universities to update the DTS and
also engage in joint horizon-scanning activities to identify those
emerging technologies with potential defence relevance.

**_Research and Development at Dstl._**

_31 The extent and value of spillovers between the defence and civil_
_industries is subject to much to debate and there are many anecdotal_
_examples of spillovers either way, but the overall picture is not clear._
_MOD DTI_ _dHMT illb_ _d_ _i_ _f_ _h_ _hi hi_


**Key R&T challenges for UK Defence:**

¬ maintain technological advantage to
counter emerging threats;

¬ sustain investment levels to maintain
our relative global position;

¬ develop knowledge management and systems
integration skills in the defence sector so that
technologies can be matured and integrated
into war winning systems for the future;

¬ recruit/retain skilled people to act as the MOD intelligent
customer for R&T acquisition to meet defence needs;

¬ develop design and acquisition processes to enable
technology insertion through equipment life;


-----

**Maintaining the quality and**
**competitiveness of national R&T**

A5.18 Having agreed the priorities it is important that UK
Government and industry work together to invest and maintain
those key areas and the skilled R&T people we need to work in
them so as to maximise the value from our investment.


###### A5


**Working more eff ectively with industry:**

¬ the MOD Technology Strategy identifi es those
technologies we believe are critical to defence;


¬ through ‘Suppliers Days’ we present the R&T
challenges we face and the eff ects we seek;

¬ increasing the amount of the research programme open to
competition should broaden and deepen the supplier base;


technicians (32%) and managerial and professional skills (28%)[7]. According
to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the
UK has 5.5 researchers per 1,000 people employed (below the OECD average
of 6.5) compared to 7.1 in France, 8.6 in the US and 15.8 in Finland[8].

**_Laboratory sample testing - Dstl._**


¬ partnering with industry and universities in our 6
Towers of Excellence to shares benefi ts and costs
and increase the pull through of technology;

¬ Defence Technology Centres (DTCs) foster
collaboration with industry and universities;


¬ jointly funded by MOD and industry;
¬ MOD has earmarked £90 million to
the DTCs over a 5 year period;

¬ they are diverse and cover; Data and
Information Fusion; Human Factors Integration;
Electromagnetic Remote Sensing, and; Systems
Engineering for Autonomous and Systems;

¬ spinning in COTS technology where it meets defence needs.


A5.19 The UK Government has set a target to raise national investment
in R&T to 2.5% of GDP by 2014[6]. To support this national policy, the
defence sector needs to maintain investment in R&T to a level that
allows us to retain world-class capability in critical areas of national
importance, an attractive partner for collaboration and an intelligent
customer for systems or technologies, which will include MOTS and
COTS. We will increase the value from our joint investment by:

¬ focusing on the capabilities needed to meet
national defence and security priorities.


A5.21 The Roberts review[9] found that fewer students were choosing
to study science and engineering disciplines and it concluded that
attractive alternative careers for science graduates would constrain their
supply to R&T employers and reduce innovation. The Government Chief
Scientifi c Adviser has recently pointed out that the proportion of students
studying for degrees in science has increased from 38% to 41% between
1997/98 and 2003/04, though the increases were mainly in biological
and computer sciences. There has been a decrease in A-level entries in
mathematics, physics, chemistry, computer science and biology of 7.5%
from 1997 to 2004[10]. However, there are still relatively few students
entering mathematics, hard science and engineering degrees[11].

A5.22 In MOD, our Head of Profession is charged with meeting
MOD’s needs for R&T staff . In order to make use of both national and
international R&T, MOD and industry need in-house R&T staff with
knowledge and systems integrations skills who can pull technologies
together to develop capability solutions. We will also want teams which
have true technical depth and world class research expertise in those
priority areas we wish to lead as a nation. Increasingly interdisciplinary
teams make the greatest contribution to knowledge advances.


A5.23 The MOD is moving away from doing most of its research inhouse and is encouraging competition from industry and the university
sector. DERA has been split into the Defence science and technology
laboratory (Dstl), which focuses on core defence research that must be
done in Government, and QinetiQ. In 2002/03 around 90% of our applied
and corporate research was done in Dstl or QinetiQ. By 2009/10 we plan to
compete around 60% of the research budget[12] that equated to our applied

**_Figure A5(ii) – Increase in competition in the MOD Research Programme._**


A5.24 In addition to developing the supplier base through competition,
initiatives like Towers of Excellence and Defence Technology Centres have
helped to increase partnering arrangements, share costs and improved
bid quality. We are also developing the work we do through collaborative
ventures: for instance we are pursuing the setting up of joint government/
industry partnerships such as an International Technology Alliance (ITA) in
the realm of network and information sciences (UK/USA) and an Innovation &
Technology Partnership for Guided Weapons technology (UK/France). Where
elements of the R&T programme are contracted out, it remains MOD policy
that, to the extent allowed by our international obligations, this work should
normally be carried out onshore. This is to ensure that the UK retains and
develops those capabilities required for its national defence and security.
However, we shall seek to increase competition in Europe to its maximum
useful extent via the use of research collaboration between governments;
competition will be the preferred method for letting such contracts.

**Changing the way we access R&T to**
**support military capability**


A5.29 The MOD’s international collaboration strategy will enable us to
identify nations’ strengths and develop partnerships that will increase UK
and partner nation military capability. Around 12% of our current research
programme would not be achievable without international collaboration
and it is essential to sustain this if we are to continue to operate alongside
high technology allies. Our main partners for collaboration are the US and
European nations, specifi cally France and Sweden. Italy may also increase in
importance, in line with the inward investment of Italian industry in the UK.


¬ research collaboration can produce a return of up
to fi ve times the value of the UK investment;

¬ research collaboration with the US will continue
to be of signifi cant mutual benefi t;


**International R&T Collaboration:**

¬ we will pursue international research collaboration
where it adds joint long-term value to Defence;
this may also provide benefi t to industry;


A5.25 We will work with the national and global technology
supply chain to meet the demands of the military requirement. We
will compete much of our research programme, which will help
develop the supplier base. We will also better target our international
collaboration activities to access global R&T with defence relevance.

A5.26 We will use the commercial market for our capability solutions
wherever appropriate but the ability to provide an intelligent customer
function for MOTS and COTS solution will persist. This transfer, and
adaptation as necessary, of civil technologies, either directly or via products,
into Defence is called ‘Defence spin-in’. Expert in-house R&T capability
will maintain the UK’s credibility in areas of international collaboration.


A5.30 **MOTS solutions - There will be instances in which MOD**
paying for the development of technology and equipment neither
represents good value for money nor is essential to maintaining national
capability. In those cases we shall go to the best possible source to
meet our needs, subject of course to security considerations.

A5.31 **COTS solutions - These will meet many of our technology**
needs from the broader industrial and university base. Furthermore as
the global investment in R&T continues to increase, and as an ever larger
number of countries contribute to this overall growth, it will not be


¬ European collaborative research will focus on joint industrial
programmes to develop defence relevant technology;

opportunities for collaborations between European nations;


A5.27 **Maintained fully in the UK - This R&T capability will be of**
vital strategic importance to UK Defence and will require full provenance
of a UK supply chain to protect our security and sovereignty.

A5.28 **Collaboration with International partners - The**
role of collaboration is to support technological excellence in
strategic defence areas, and to provide a wider understanding of
defence applications across the technology domain. The latter is
particularly important for commercially led technologies.

possible for the MOD to support cutting edge R&T activity across all areas
of R&T relevant to defence. However, it is unrealistic to assume that the
majority of future defence needs could be met with COTS solutions.

**Defence ‘Spin-In’ and COTS:**

¬ globally, civil markets are an important driver of science and
technology. It makes sense to harness these civil technologies
for defence use, an example being the military use of ICT;


**Ensuring R&T feeds into and improves**
**the defence acquisition process**

A5.33 R&T must also be used to improve the acquisition process by supporting
our ability to make better decisions and enabling us to identify more cost-eff ective
ways of meeting capability needs. Appropriate and targeted investment in
this area can reduce risk throughout the acquisition process, through analysis
to generate informed options and an increased understanding of technological
risks, the use of exploitation plans and technology demonstrator programmes.


**Exploitation plans and technology**
**demonstrator programmes**

A5.34 We should seek to realise the value of innovation by exploiting it in new
equipment or new processes. Equipment related MOD R&T programmes should
include a greater emphasis on the development of demonstrators[12].  This requires
better exploitation plans from the start of a research project, which will be used as
a criterion for the provision of further funding. This will help the MOD and industry
determine where funding is most eff ectively allocated and allow better alignment
of funding between the Equipment Plan and the supporting R&T programmes.


¬ an active programme of technology watch is essential
to ensure that we identify these technologies;

¬ most ‘spin-in’ is the purchase of COTS products, rather
than the utilisation of civil intellectual property;


¬ the diffi culties with integrating commercial civil
products into complex military systems can often
lessen the attractiveness of a COTS solution;

¬ our R&T programme focuses strongly on those
technology areas in which the civil sector is
unlikely to produce the solutions we need;


¬ where our research programme generates technology with
dual-use we shall continue to ensure that is exploited to its fullest
potential, through review of our intellectual property policy.


A5.32 Figure A5(iii) represents a complex modern military platform
through a small number of top level systems. These systems will contain
a balance of bespoke, MOTS and COTS equipment. Whilst COTS systems
will be heavily utilised to ensure cost eff ectiveness, there will always be
signifi cant elements that must be bespoke defence technology led. e.g.
weapons, countermeasures, sensors, combat systems, aspects of propulsion
and elements of platform design. It must be noted that the balance of
design and development eff ort can vary signifi cantly depending on the
project. The key is to understand where civil COTS can be integrated alongside
defence technology to give value for money and military capability.


**Eff ective technology insertion in acquisition**

A5.35 The time between major platform procurements is increasing, as is
the proliferation and rate of change in R&T. The UK must increase the pace of
technology insertion, drawing upon advances in the defence and civil sectors.
This will allow us to respond to both evolution (the norm) and revolution (the
exception) in capability. We should look to open architectures that facilitate
incremental technology insertion (i.e. ‘plug and play’). Platforms and systems
should be designed with upgrade and fl exibility in mind, noting that new roles for
existing equipment will be identifi ed to respond to changing threats. We cannot
keep pace with US investment, but we must ensure that we are interoperable
with them. If we can fi nd a way to plan and acquire our systems and platforms
with technology insertion in mind then we can better sustain the capability of our
military equipment in a more cost eff ective way. This will maintain the standing of
our military capability where it needs to be, relative to other allies and competitors.
In seeking to achieve an increase in the pace of take-up of appropriate technology,
the UK will continue to draw upon advances within the defence and civil R&T
sectors. We need to identify those technologies that are likely to evolve rapidly
in order to target the areas we need to design for modularity and insertion.

**Understanding and exploiting value**
**in the technology supply chain**

A5.36 We will work with industry to gain a better understanding
of the nature and structure of the technology supply chain from prime
contractors through to the lower tiers. We will continue to meet most of
our major technology and acquisition requirements through large prime
contractors, given their expertise and experience in systems integration.
However, in today’s world of rapid technology change, there also needs to
be a more eff ective engagement with the so-called ‘lower-tier’ suppliers;
namely the small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and universities
who are often involved in the development of very novel technologies
and materials. We need to understand value at all levels, highlighting
the role of innovation through the supply chain. One example of the
varied technology suppliers to a major prime contractor developing a key
component in a propulsion delivery system is shown in Figure A5(iv).


A5.37 The critical role of the prime/system-integrator organisation is
to manage the overall design, concept and architecture of the system and
the sub-system technologies. A key technological component may lie in a
SME and it is important that both the prime contractors and the lower-tier
technology sources are supported to ensure access to innovative technology.

A5.38 The MOD, major defence industries, universities and the DTI
need to make a combined eff ort to identify innovative SMEs and their
capabilities and improve means of engagement with them. It is important
that SMEs are made aware of the opportunities available to them with
defence as a possible market for their innovation and technologies.

**Innovation and technology to enable**

A5.39 Greater utilisation of innovation and technology will ensure
that incremental capability insertion can be achieved and that system
and component obsolescence can be overcome. Technology exploitation
may be targeted at the reduction of through life cost and the reduction
of the logistics and maintenance burden experienced with older
equipment. These benefi ts could be delivered throughout the supply
chain to enhance the operational availability of military capability.


A5.40 We will focus more R&T eff ort to support through life capability
sustainment and continue to work with industry to develop and insert
technology to increase the endurance of equipment in the expeditionary battle
space and successfully deliver capability whether on land, on or under water, in
the air and in cyberspace. This shift in focus, will enable through life platform
capability sustainment/enhancement programmes to insert new technologies
(e.g. new sensors, weapons, materials etc.) as they become suffi ciently mature.

A5.41 Many of the conclusions for the R&T community and how these
will be taken forward are contained in Part C and form an element of
how the DIS challenges will be taken forward. Here, those challenges
that are most pertinent to R&T are expanded to form an outline plan of
how to meet those challenges. We must agree the R&T and capability
areas we will undertake nationally and those we are happy to source
on the global market from other defence industries/civil sector.


-----

A5.42 We must align our defence priorities to meet MOD’s needs and
maintain the quality of UK R&T. Our R&T programme must focus on:

¬ R&T aligned to MOD military capability needs;


###### A5


¬ and those emerging technologies that may be
disruptive/or have defence applications.

**_Computational fl uid dynamics in Typhoon drag coeffi cient modelling._**


A5.44 We must work together more eff ectively with
industry (including SMEs) and the universities, to stimulate
innovation and exploit R&T to meet defence needs.

A5.45 We must grow the skills base to ensure we have the
necessary supply of highly skilled engineers and scientists.


A5.48 We must further enhance the science and technology
‘literacy’ and expertise of our staff . The MOD must provide career
structures for scientist and engineers that recruit and retain highly
qualifi ed staff in an increasingly competitive global skills market.


A5.46 We must develop new ways of working together to maintain
national strengths, get better value from our joint investment, identify
and exploit UK innovation and intelligently access and exploit the global
R&T base; this will include placing greater emphasis on technology
demonstration. We must consider how to improve technology insertion,
thereby ensuring our systems and platforms have a battle-winning advantage.

A5.47 We need to examine how R&T might better support our
acquisition process. Through the use of better decision support,
adoption of new models for military eff ect, implementation of
technology solutions it should be possible to provide more cost
eff ective military capability and reduce technical risk in the EP.


A5.43 We must play our part together in supporting the Government
strategy to get national R&T spend to a competitive 2.5% of GDP by 2014.


**Technology sharing across the Atlantic**

The relationship with the USA is in general a healthy one. While the
USA procures most of its equipment onshore, the UK defence industry
continues to do far better than most countries in competing for US
defence requirements, based on both a degree of mutual understanding
and trust in our security arrangements, building on our broader strategic
relationship, and mutual respect for respective industrial and technology
strengths. For instance, the BAE Systems M777 155mm lightweight
towed howitzer has been selected by the Marine Corps. We also welcome
companies based in other countries, including in the USA, which are
prepared to invest in the UK, especially where they bring with them
useful knowledge and help broaden the range of potential UK suppliers,
potentially helping to sustain key sovereign capabilities. In some cases,
UK subsidiaries of US-based suppliers have even supplied back into
the US market. That is not to say, however, that we do not continue to
pursue greater reciprocity of access with the USA. In particular, and
for sovereign rather than commercial reasons, we continue to strive
for improvements in technology sharing arrangements required.


The size and capability of the US defence market has made it a magnet for
UK-based defence industry, and an obvious source of supply of equipment
to meet UK military requirements that are predicated to a large degree on
US-led coalition operations. Refl ecting this, the UK is currently involved in a
substantial number of co-operative programmes with the USA, the biggest
single programme being the Joint Strike Fighter. In addition a very large
number of UK programmes, and collaborative programmes with European
partners, are dependent to some degree on US technology. A number of UK
companies (led by BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce, but including Cobham, Smiths,
and others) have signifi cant industrial footprints on both sides of the Atlantic.


To meet our own sovereign needs, it is important that we continue
to have the autonomous capability to operate, support and where
necessary adapt the equipment that we procure. Appropriate technology
transfer is therefore of crucial importance. This is so for any cooperative
project, but in practice diffi culties have arisen particularly with the
US, whose technology disclosure policy we have found less adapted
to the needs of cooperative procurement than those of our partners in
Europe. To reiterate, this is not about gaining competitive advantage
for UK industry; it is about being confi dent that the equipment we buy
meets the capability requirements against which it is procured and
can be modifi ed eff ectively to meet emerging requirements through
life.  We fully recognise the need to ensure that intellectual property
is protected, and that appropriate measures are put in place to ensure
this; security is a key issue for us, just as it is for the USA. But a certain
degree of technology transfer is required if we are to be able to fully
cooperate with the USA (or any other partner) on our equipment
programmes. What we are striving towards is an agreed framework which
facilitates this whilst ensuring that our mutual security needs are met.

The importance of transatlantic defence industrial cooperation
lies in enabling both UK and US Armed Forces to acquire more
eff ective military capabilities, at better value for money, than would
otherwise be the case, and to cooperate together in pursuit of
common security objectives. It is in the interest of both Governments
and of both industries to improve the current situation.

###### Defence exports
### A6


###### Introduction

A6.1 During the Cold War, the Soviet Union supplied and dominated
markets in other Warsaw Pact countries and client states for the output
of its military industrial complex. There were also established defence
trade links between NATO countries and allies. Following the demise
of the Soviet Union and end of the Cold War, these established defence
trade links broke down and during the 1990s the export market
became more competitive, with for example, Russia and Poland now
competing in markets alongside the USA, the UK, France and others.

A6.2 Over the last decade, the UK defence industry has won export
orders worth an average of £5 billion per annum, bringing signifi cant
benefi ts to industry and MOD. This achievement has secured the UK as the
world’s second largest defence exporter after the USA. Now that the market
has become more competitive, suppliers must be able to off er customers a
broader range of services; the off er of equipment alone is unlikely to meet
the total requirements of most customers, who now expect suppliers to
off er package solutions covering equipment and support throughout the life
of a product. Indeed, as we increasingly encourage our suppliers to design
for through life capability management, this is an area where UK defence
industry can demonstrate increasing competitiveness in the global market.

A6.3 The UK defence industry has a range of world-class technologies
and products which it can off er allies. Much of this has been tested
and adapted as necessary by real operations, and as a consequence
potential export customers can have more confi dence in its reliability
and performance. UK success in overseas markets has traditionally been
in major platforms, but exports of sub-systems and the provision of
support services are becoming increasingly important. SMEs have an
important part to play in maintaining the UK’s strong market position.

A6.4. The UK defence industry has also gained competitive
advantage in export markets by off ering the UK’s world leading
design excellence and pioneering innovation & invention skills. This is
especially potent where another nation’s design capability is fragile or
has been lost. This type of export has the added benefi t of helping to
sustain our own design capability for use on national programmes.

A6.5 Defence exports bring commercial benefi t to UK companies
and around 20% of UK defence employment is in export work. However
a UK defence industry that is able to generate signifi cant export revenue
also has value for Defence for a number of more specifi c reasons :

¬ Defence exports support defence diplomacy
and in some countries may act as a key enabling
activity for a bi-lateral defence relationship.

¬ Defence exports contribute to building local operational
capability and therefore enhance interoperability with
our own forces, especially during peacekeeping missions.

¬ Longer production runs also spread fi xed overhead costs. The
benefi t thus accruing to industry may be shared by us in the form
of lower prices on future purchases from the same supplier.

¬ By sustaining longer production runs and off ering opportunities to
develop equipment for export customers’ requirements, defence
exports help to maintain key sovereign capabilities in
both production capacity and systems engineering skills, which
we might otherwise have had to intervene to maintain.


-----

A6.6 For these reasons[1], the Government puts considerable eff ort into
supporting responsible defence exports, in pursuit of our broader foreign
and security interests and for the direct value to Defence that they generate.
This eff ort is led by our Defence Export Services Organisation and supported
by other parts of the MOD, the Armed Forces and wider Government.

###### The Export Credits Guarantee Department supported £766m of defence business in 2004/2005, representing 38% of the total business supported.


###### A6


A6.7 The UK is also at the forefront of promoting internationally the need
to ensure defence exports are responsible. With a wide range of other partners
the UK has made progress since 2003 in building support for international
agreement at the 2006 UN Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) Programme
of Action Review Conference on minimum common criteria to underpin controls
on transfers of SALW (including import, export and transhipment). Although
the UN Programme of Action specifi cally only covers SALW, and is politically
binding, any principles that are agreed may eventually have wider implications
than SALW. In the slightly longer term the UK is also pursuing the wider objective
of a legally binding international treaty to cover the trade in all conventional
weapons. The UK has set out six criteria for such a treaty, calling for it to be: legally binding; include all conventional arms; a separate, self-standing initiative;
based on core principles, which make clear when exports would be unacceptable;
have an eff ective mechanism for enforcement and monitoring; and include
a wide range of signatories, including the world’s major arms exporters.

A6.8 There are also a few potential risks associated with defence exports,
which need careful managing if both appropriate sovereignty and value
for Defence are to be protected – for instance, of the unintended transfer
of technology, and the risk that a friend now may be a foe later. To manage
these risks, we have a number of tools, including the following:


governments’ directed off sets can have a particularly distorting
eff ect on the supply chain’s operation, however, and thus create
sustainment issues for domestic sovereign capabilities. MOD’s
own approach to off set, known as industrial participation, does
not specify where work should be placed, but encourages foreign
bidders to use UK sub-contractors on a competitive basis.

**_Merlin helicopter._**


A6.10 In general, defence industry’s priority is to produce systems to meet
the requirements that we specify, as the main customer. Hitherto, export
opportunity for a particular product has not necessarily been factored into
the earlier design stage. This means that, in many cases, UK equipment is too
sophisticated and therefore too expensive for many potential export customers.
This has tended to be the case for example with warships, and the UK has lost
market share to competitors that have considered exportability at the early
design stage of a platform. This has involved the adoption of greater modularity
in design that then allows the supplier to off er a diff erent set of options to export
customers. As we move more to through life capability management ourselves,
facilitated by open architectures and modular approaches, there is now an
opportunity to consider at the design stage of a programme features which
would enhance a product’s exportability (and reduce its through life costs).

A6.11 Further, given the internationalisation of the defence industry, most
products on the market now contain a mix of sub-systems sourced from diff erent
suppliers, regardless of whether they have been developed in collaboration with
other nations or in response to a UK requirement. With the high levels of foreign
investment now in the UK defence industrial base, there are greater opportunities
for UK-based companies to work in partnership or in collaboration with overseas
fi rms, thus giving them broader market access. For example, the recent teaming
arrangement between AgustaWestland and Lockheed Martin led to the recent
success of US 101 - derived from the EH 101 - in the US Presidential helicopter
competition. In addition, since there remains further scope for consolidation
within the global industry, there may be opportunities for UK companies to
access new markets by virtue of selected merger and acquisition activity.


###### New opportunities for export advantage

A6.9 The UK Armed Forces enjoy a high international reputation and
there is no better recommendation when marketing UK defence systems
overseas than emphasising its UK in-service credentials. It is much harder to
sell equipment abroad that has not been endorsed by the UK Armed Forces.


¬ We apply Strategic Export Controls to prevent exports we believe to
be inconsistent with our legal commitments and wider policy. These
take into account for example the UK’s international commitments,
including sanctions and embargoes; respect for human rights
and fundamental freedoms; the internal situation in the country
of fi nal destination; concerns that proposed exports might be
used for internal repression or international aggression; risks to
regional stability; national security; the recipient’s attitude to the
international community, including towards terrorism; the risk of
diversion; the risk that the cost of the export would have negative
developmental impact; plus other considerations as described in
the Consolidated EU And National Arms Export Licensing Criteria.
All export licence applications are considered on a case-by-case
basis with the MOD, FCO and DfID advising the DTI as the licensing
authority, with Cabinet-level Ministerial discussions as necessary.

¬ A recurrent theme throughout the DIS is that we along with the
defence industry need to understand more clearly the complete
supply chain needed to sustain sovereign capabilities. While
exports will often sustain supply chains that would otherwise
have been without business, this can be undermined by other
nations’ requirements for off set – i.e. that particular elements of
the work on UK programmes should be subcontracted off shore

###### Choosing the right approach
### A7


###### Competition, alternative approaches to competition and presenting, measuring and delivering value for money in defence 

 Competition

A7.1 A sustainable and competitive UK defence industry remains essential
to the delivery of military capability to the UK’s Armed Forces. Open and
fair competition is a fundamental component of our procurement policy to
deliver aff ordable defence capability at better overall value for money.

A7.2 Figure A7(i) shows that over the past four years, about three quarters
of our contracts, by value, have been let competitively, covering the full
spectrum of procurement from major equipment projects through to clothing
and supplies.


###### Choosing the right approach
### A7


**A more fl exible approach**

A7.5 With increasing technological complexity, globalisation and
industry consolidation, priced based competition may not automatically
result in the best opportunity for successful acquisition or maintain
key sovereign capabilities. This places challenges on our relationship
with industry which remains fi rmly rooted in project performance.

A7.6 Whilst competition allows the advantage of tangible price
comparison determined by market forces and the ability to compare competing
proposals for compliance, it can also sometimes drive unintended behaviours
and consequences for both us and industry. These may include unrealistic
timescales, an over optimistic assessment of risk and hence cost, and the
potential loss of fl exibility for timely insertions of technology in the future.

A7.7 We will continue to use market forces where we can to determine
better value for money, but defence is not a perfect market place. We will
therefore adopt procurement approaches that consider the nature of the
market in the relevant sector and provide the fl exibility to respond to structural
changes, so as to sustain key sovereign capabilities and to ensure long term
value for money. The Key Supplier Management process will enable us to
assess the strategic and aggregate impact of diff erent potential acquisition
choices, particularly those that have signifi cant industrial base consequences.

A7.8 Whilst this Chapter focuses mainly on our relationship with
prime suppliers, we fully recognise the important role played by Small
and Medium size Enterprises (SMEs) - defined as companies employing
250 people or less - which constitute a significant core of direct suppliers
to MOD. In 2004/05, just over half of the MOD contracts let were directly
with SMEs, accounting for over half a billion pounds. Many SMEs play
a crucial role in meeting Urgent Operational Requirements (UORs),
undertake prime roles for smaller requirements, and are potentially
well placed to fulfil other roles in the context of the Models described
below. We are widening our supply chain focus below the prime level
to identify critical sources of key capability and technology and further
to encourage SME entry into a broader range of defence opportunities.
Whilst the MOD already has supply chain oversight[1] provisions in place,
we are developing senior level links with regional industry groups
where issues of specific interest to SMEs can be bought to our notice.

**Alternative approaches**

A7.9 The 2002 Defence Industrial Policy (DIP) recognised that even
in competitive environments there are a number of wider factors besides
cost and operational eff ectiveness, aff ordability and long term value for
money that will infl uence supplier and procurement selection. These
include security of supply and the retention of key technologies and
industrial capabilities, the implications for export potential, our wider
policy framework and industrial participation. In addition there are
procurement factors that may be assessed and these are addressed in
the models set out below. These factors will be included in Invitations
to Tender (ITTs) with relative weightings, and will embrace wider
factors insofar as they relate to the individual procurements.

**_Figure A7(i)._**

A7.3 Procurements for non-warlike goods and services are conducted
in accordance with the European Union Procurement Regulations. We will
work with the European Defence Agency with regard to the procurement of
warlike goods and services, to harmonise the UK’s approach with the voluntary
Code of Conduct on more open competition. In addition, we will continue to
advertise our requirements to encourage suppliers to seek business at all levels
of the supply chain. This Chapter explains how we will adopt procurement
strategies to make best use of available capabilities and capacities.

A7.4 We are tackling industry’s concerns about the expense and
uncertainty that can arise from protracted and ineffi cient tendering. We
are taking steps to speed up decision making and to minimise costs. For
example, we will place more emphasis on targeting smaller numbers
of potential suppliers with the best credentials to bid for individual
requirements, rather then rely on a large panel of bidders just to maintain
competitive pressure - expensive in terms of the cost of bidding, the time
it takes to down-select and evaluate a large number of bids and unfulfi lled
supplier expectations. We will extend the use of streamlined procedures
to pre-qualify potential bidders, to select early a preferred bidder and to
k h i f d l i l d


-----

A7.10 The DIP further recognised that there are occasions when competition
may not be able to deliver the best long term value for money or sustain key UK
defence industrial capabilities. We will not pursue competition beyond the point
where it can off er long term advantage or where the cost of running a competition
is demonstrably disproportionate to the benefi ts that might be achieved.

A7.11 Overall, the key objective from our perspective is how to present,
**measure and deliver value for money in situations where competitions are**
not held.


¬ Competition exists but the procurement can readily be compared
or benchmarked against similar technologies, supplies and
services, or for UORs where equipment is readily available.

A7.13 The models below, and Figure A7(ii) show how
we will select suppliers and undertake value for money
assessments in these diff erent procurement situations.


###### A7


A7.12 We will consider alternative approaches to competition in the
procurement situations set out below. They are not intended to be prescriptive:

¬ One supplier has the capacity and capability to deliver the
requirement and is chosen because it is the sole source of supply, or it
is chosen on the basis of consistently high performance compared to
other suppliers, or it is the only suitable supplier to sustain sovereign
capabilities in industrial base or other procurement grounds.


A7.14 The approaches set out in this Chapter are intended as a
guide to our acquisition teams and industry in designing procurement
strategies to achieve the best project outcomes and in making value for
money and investment comparisons and decisions. The success of these
approaches will depend on a number of key cultural enablers including:

¬ establishing and sustaining the right relationships and
behaviours across the acquisition community;


¬ extending ‘best practice’ partnering approaches
to appropriate MOD projects;

¬ engendering more openness and transparency in our dealings
to secure better long term value for money for the Government,
and profi tability (based on good performance) for industry.


¬ No single supplier has the capacity and capability to deliver the
requirement and where an inclusive and willing group or groups of
suppliers might be formed and sustained.

¬ The through life support of a capability that requires the engagement
of the equipment Design Authority and/or other systems engineering
capability.

**Model 1: One supplier has the capacity and capability to deliver the**
**requirement and is chosen because it is the sole source of supply, or it**
**is chosen on the basis of consistently high performance compared to**
**other suppliers, or it is the only suitable supplier to sustain sovereign**
**capabilities in the industrial base or other procurement grounds.**

**Considering the approach**

A7.15 For long-term projects, aff ordability, timescale, priorities and technology
insertion plans will be communicated wherever possible so that suppliers can
make informed and focused investment decisions and assess opportunities prior
to commitment. Early notifi cation will also enable suppliers to participate in the
process of identifying trade off s between performance, time and through life cost.

A7.16 In devising the procurement strategy, consideration will need
to be given to factors other than price; where there is technological
uncertainty at the early stages of the capabilities lifecycle, this may not be
determinable to acceptable level of accuracy. The outcome is ultimately
focused on a commercial arrangement with a single legal entity.

**Supplier selection**

A7.17 These considerations are likely to be particularly relevant to the
Assessment Phase (AP) of a project where priced based competition may not
produce the best value outcome. In selecting potential suppliers, we will assess
past and current performance, organisational capability, the pull through and
utilisation of technology and capability, evidence of co-operative partnering
and continuous improvement in productivity and reduced through life costs.

A7.18 When a project progresses from the AP to the Demonstration and
Manufacture phases, the early down selection of a preferred supplier from a
group of competing suppliers, may be determined by comparative reference
to the factors described in the ‘Assessing Value for Money’ section below.

A7.19 Where there is a need to select a potential sole source supplier i.e. where
the package of work itself creates or supports a critical industrial capability for
reasons of sovereign control, but which is insuffi cient to maintain multiple suppliers,
the above selection criteria will apply but with the emphasis on informing a
d i i b h h d l f d ff d bili d


**Project control**

A7.20 At the heart of this approach is the pursuance of improved,
through life project and commercial arrangements that allow more
fl exibility backed up by an incremental approach to contracting, a genuine
emphasis on de-risking, and the identifi cation of key indicators to measure
performance and to inform entry/exit decisions at each phase of the project.

**Assessing value for money**

A7.21 For sole source requirements, the ultimate assessment of
value for money is taken at point of deciding whether to proceed to
meet the required military capability. The value of the capability may
be subject to benchmarking, but where no such benchmarks exist this
decision will be against the absolute need of the capability, its relative
priority and its relative aff ordability, throughout the capability life.

A7.22 Except for most sole suppliers, the prospect of follow on work
will be a powerful incentive; the supplier’s demonstrable performance and
behaviours at key contract stages and the fl ow of sound through life value for
money proposals/solutions for follow on phases will be a determinant to the
placing of further packages of work. Where they exist, benchmarks derived
from competitive sources will also be used to inform the selection decision.

A7.23 In the absence of competitive price pressure, it would be essential
to adopt a robust approach to the assessment of cost. Parallel working by
MOD and industry estimators leading to agreed estimates of cost would
refl ect the close and open working relationship necessary in this approach.

A7.24 It may also be sensible to use joint through life cost and business models,
in addition to backwards-looking open-book accounting; in the early stages
these models will inform planning and cost assumptions, providing the basis for
project cost estimates. During its life the model will be actively maintained to
inform subsequent business case and investment decisions and support project
governance. They will also allow ‘what if’ analyses for changes to the project
and periodic value for money assessments against external benchmarks.

A7.25 Inherent in the model construct is the joint commitment, which
will be enshrined in the commercial arrangements, progressively to populate
these models with the full costs of ownership as they develop and mature.

**Model 2: No single supplier has the capacity and capability**
**to deliver a requirement and where an inclusive and willing**
**group of suppliers might be formed and sustained.**

**Considering the approach**

A7.26 The focus falls on establishing a successful engagement with
a Prime Industrial Group, with the right culture and behaviours and a
willingness to work in an open, partnering environment to drive value
for money throughout the life of the capability. This will include a
commitment by the Group fully to share cost data and the business model
through which shareholder value is to be delivered whilst respecting
commercial confi dentiality. The Group will seek fl exible solutions with
open architectures to provide for the best capability outcome, and make
full use of COTS procurement wherever this gives better value for money.

A7.27 In circumstances where we seek to acquire an integrated set of
military capabilities, for which we may not have the necessary domain
knowledge or expertise, we may partner with a systems integrator.
The systems integrator will work with us to establish the optimal mix
of capabilities and suppliers to meet the requirement, to make trade
ff d i i d k id i f k bl d i


-----

**Supplier selection**

A7.28 In many circumstances there may only be one Prime Industrial
Group which provides the breadth of delivery skills and industrial
capability and capacity to meet the anticipated requirement. It may
be necessary for us to act as facilitator during the period which leads
to the formation of the inclusive group. The criteria for selecting
eligible suppliers will largely be the same as that for Model 1.


**Assessing value for money**

A7.35 The challenge for us and industry is to fi nd mutually acceptable,
robust commercial arrangements that incentivise delivery of the required
support at minimum and continuously decreasing cost and improved long term
value for money. In so doing, we would wish to transition from arrangements
that reward volume and the cost associated with that volume, to one which
rewards the active management of risk and the value it brings to defence

- contracting for availability and /or other aspects of military capability.


###### A7


A7.29 In forming the Group, a list of potential second tier suppliers
may be drawn up. Contracts Bulletin and, where appropriate, Offi cial
Journal of the European Union (OJEU) advertising will be used to keep
the supply chain advised of future competitive opportunities.

**Assessing value for money**


A7.30 As with Model 1 except that the procurement would be through cooperative working with the Group, in the spirit of openness and transparency,
where there would be open and full discussion of all relevant data by all
parties on an on going basis. This will not preclude the potential to compete
individual systems or indeed elements of the whole at various stages in
the programme, subject to the wider factors as discussed in chapter A9.

A7.31 Within the Prime Industrial Group we would wish to encourage
commercial arrangements that share risk and rewards and incentives to
drive costs down and to seek opportunities for improving value for money
through the life of the project. We will give therefore renewed emphasis
to Gainshare, Target Cost Incentive Fee pricing and the use of risk adjusted
profi t according to the type of work carried out under the contract.

**Model 3. The through life support of a capability that**
**requires the engagement of the equipment Design Authority**
**(DA) and/or other systems engineering capability.**


A7.36 In return for consistently high and innovative performance, industry
might reasonably expect the prospect of greater reward with a better certainty
of revenue. The rebalancing of risks would almost certainly extend Industry’s
reach and infl uence into support areas traditionally managed by us such as
maintenance, stock control, storage and distribution. For upgrades, this might
also include opportunities to work collaboratively on capability management.

A7.37 Inherent in these arrangements is a willingness by us and industry to
build and sustain eff ective partnering relationships, to work to a clear purpose
and in an open and transparent environment, to share performance and cost
data and to evolve a clearly understood business model that will incorporate
the full costs of ownership. These mirror the concepts detailed in Model 1.


A7.38 Recognising that competitions are costly in terms of time and
eff ort to both us and industry, it may dispense with competition where
a contract has recently been let for an identical or similar requirement
and where the value of the goods or services are small or the timescales
urgent. In instances where we have an urgent need to meet additional
capability requirements for specifi c operations, we will utilise our UOR
procedure. This is used for the rapid purchase of new or additional
equipment, or for an enhancement or essential modifi cation to existing
equipment. This may require existing DA leadership in order to support
a current or imminent military operation or operational emergency.

**Supplier selection**


**Model 4. Competition exists but the procurement can readily**
**be compared or benchmarked against similar technologies,**
**supplies and services or, in the case of Urgent Operational**
**Requirements (UORs), where equipment is readily available.**

**Considering the approach**


**Considering the approach**

A7.32 With the approaching relative downturn in the procurement of
large new capability platforms, long term support is increasingly seen by
many suppliers as the primary source of revenue in the defence market
in the future. Whilst the conventional position is to seek to compete
these requirements where it is practicable, and there will be instances
where this still represents the best option, we will consider alternatives to
competition where they off er the prospect of better value for money.


A7.33 This is particularly pertinent for legacy systems where the DA
may have been appointed during the equipment procurement stage
and would have acquired intellectual property, extensive knowledge of
the design and expertise in its application. Thus the DA is best placed
to be able to interact eff ectively with us to manage technical risk and
trade off design investment with other aspects including reliability,
safety and maintenance. In some cases the relevant systems engineering
capability may be vested in a broader entity than the DA, especially
when upgrade or improved support opportunities require the insertion
of new technology, but it is very unlikely not to include the DA.

**Supplier selection**


A7.39 In circumstances where suppliers have been selected against
recently established value for money benchmarks, we will normally
place additional, related requirements with that supplier.

A7.40 For UORs, rapid response is of the essence and the assumption
is that there is a supplier of an available equipment that meets the
need. Although not exempt from the principles of competition the
rules governing advertising and bidding may be reduced or waived.


**Assessing value for money**

A7.41 We may negotiate with the successful tenderer, by benchmarking
against the contractual terms obtained following competition, to procure the
emergent requirement. In so doing we must be assured that the terms will be
at least as favourable as if a separate competition had been exercised. Such
practice occurs regularly for the provision of spares, consumables and services.


A7.34 Generally, the preferred supplier would be the appointed
DA, subject to confi rmation of competence, capability, capacity,
fi nancial status and willingness to engage in an open cooperative
partnering arrangement. Maintaining this relationship is of course
dependent on demonstrating acceptable performance and satisfying

###### Transparency
### A8


###### Greater openness: increasing the transparency of our future plans 

 Making a diff erence through greater openness

A8.1 Central to the DIS is a recognition of the need to develop much closer
relationships with our industrial suppliers, with a view to promoting closer
working, greater trust, increased partnership and a sense of mutual endeavour.
Critical to this – both as an outcome and as an enabler to change – is the need for
both ourselves and our suppliers to increase the transparency of our future plans.

A8.2 The need to respond to shifts of emphasis and priority, in accordance
with changes in the global security environment, evolving costings within
the programme, and to any overall changes driven by the spending review
process and other planning processes, will place limits on the certainty of
these plans. However we recognise that greater transparency - across the
lifecycle of a capability - has the potential to off er signifi cant benefi ts for
both industry and Defence, providing it is appropriately managed. Being
more open about our future acquisition plans will help industry to plan for
the longer term and to make better informed investment decisions, with
corresponding mutual benefi ts through-life. It will provide industry with
an authoritative source of information; and it should also increase investor
confi dence in defence projects. We are committed, therefore, to moving
substantially in the direction of greater openness with our suppliers.

###### What can industry expect?

A8.3 In this publication, we are already bringing together more
information about our plans in a single authoritative document than ever
before. We will in future continue to publish information routinely on the
content of the Equipment Plan, including a catalogue listing for post-Main
Gate projects of current forecast cost and ISD data. This will be regularly
updated and published in the Departmental Investment Strategy, which
will also include details of the MOD’s non-equipment investment.

A8.4 We recognise the signifi cant disadvantages that lack of information
for industry can imply, and the advantages in terms, for example, of cost-base/
overhead reduction, increased readiness and reduced cost of capital through
better investment that increased openness would facilitate. If an industry
decides to exit a business when we had undisclosed plans for future projects
there, or alternatively invests in the expectation of a likely requirement when
the most we might have is a capability aspiration, then neither industry nor
MOD benefi ts and we may lose important sovereign capabilities. To square this
circle, we are now ready to share more information than hitherto, recognising
that for certain data we will only do this in a controlled environment,
through nominated intermediaries empowered to speak authoritatively to
industry, and with industry representatives who possess appropriate security
clearances and who can protect the information appropriately. Our approach
will, of course, be driven by the imperative of securing an improvement in
overall value for money across the lifecycle of our capability requirements.
This will necessarily condition what, when and how we communicate to
industry. And we shall still need to protect information whose disclosure

**_Staff at work in MOD Main Building, Whitehall._**

###### Sector-level information

A8.5 At sector-level, we will share information on the overall indicative
planning assumptions for each sector, including illustrative Equipment
Plan expenditure, as well as that on research and through-life logistics
support, out to ten years. This will be at a level of detail that will enable
our suppliers to make informed decisions. We will also indicate the types of
technologies that we anticipate we will need to support new capabilities or
the incremental growth of equipment in-service. We will also engage in an
ongoing dialogue about the extent to which we believe a particular sector
or business is dependent on our future orders to retain the capability and
capacity needed to meet our sovereign industrial capability requirements.
We will also, as far as security restrictions allow, be prepared to discuss our
priorities for improved military capabilities over the next twenty years. All of
this information will be shared on the basis of a clear understanding that not
all of these areas will be, or may ever be, funded within the programme.

A8.6 As set out in chapter A2, our indicative planning assumptions are
subjects to change at regular intervals due to government planning processes.
Departmental budgets are usually set for the spending review period, and
beyond that, budgets can go down as well as up. This, together with costing or
strategic changes, may alter the information in the DIS.

###### Programme and project-specifi c information

A8.7 The data shared with suppliers on particular programmes and projects
will vary depending on the procurement strategy we plan to follow. Where
we are satisfi ed that there is a competitive market place and we conclude
that our indicative funding allocation is adequate we will not normally
release any additional fi nancial information. If we have doubts about the
aff ordability of our requirements we are likely to give an indication of the
indicative funding allocation we have made and, where relevant, the profi le
of that provision. In a non competitive environment the data we release will
depend on our knowledge of what the supplier can off er and the readiness
of both parties to share information for mutual benefi t. Other considerations
will include the position of a project in its lifecycle; potential sensitivities
of international partners when the project is a collaborative one; and the
f h l i hi l d bli h d i h ifi i


-----

A8.8 Depending on how these factors apply to a particular project, the
types of information that we will be ready to consider sharing with industry
are:

¬ capability requirements and planning assumptions on production
quantities;
¬ overall project timescales (including project in and out of service dates);
¬ specifi c planned dates for inviting and receiving proposals and
tenders from industry;
¬ overall budgetary assumptions for the through-life capability
requirement;
¬ planned expenditure profi les;
¬ associated procurement strategy;
¬ logistic data required to support the formulation of cost-eff ective
support solutions; and
¬ how wider factors will be included in our assessment of value for money.


¬ what information may be communicated;
¬ who will be the principal focal point for such
communications in the MOD; and
¬ who we anticipate will be the principal focal point
for such communications in industry.

A8.11 It shows how a project’s position in the CADMID cycle aff ects the
type of information that we may expose on a particular project. Other factors

- as identifi ed above - may, on a case-by-case basis, increase or reduce the
amount of information we share for specifi c projects depending on our
judgement as to how this helps us to deliver long-term value for defence.


A8.12 In the case of sector-level information, given that our budget
tends only to experience major adjustments as part of the regular planning
round, it makes sense to convene a suite of ‘sector days’ coincident with the
conclusion of our planning process. These events will provide the mechanism
for presenting our indicative planning assumptions and capability priorities
in each capability area (including relevant DLO spend) to our suppliers. This
process will be overseen by the Commercial Director of the MOD, whom we
are currently recruiting, and will bring together the relevant Key Supplier
Representatives, Director of Equipment Capability, the MOD’s Supplier
Relations Group, relevant IPTs (wherever there is a particular interest) and
Science, Innovation and Technology staff . The National Defence Industries
Council Research and the Technology Committee will continue to provide
a forum for MOD, DTI and industry discussions on technology issues.

A8.13 In areas where we recognise there are particular sustainment or
effi ciency issues to be tackled, we will continue to consider establishing
dedicated joint teams with specifi c companies, either on an individual
or collective basis, to analyse the issues and chart a way ahead. Within
such teams, with non-disclosure arrangements agreed, both sides will in
general share signifi cantly more information about MOD’s plans, industry’s
cost base, and business models and agree assumptions for assessing
potential implications. We will however only set up such arrangements
where the need is clear and we see a mutual advantage; there will
not be standing teams of this nature for all sectors or businesses.

###### What we expect from industry in return

A8.14 In return for greater visibility of our future plans, we will expect
our suppliers to increase the transparency of their future plans and business
information so that we can help confi rm the overall coherence of what
together we are aiming to achieve. In doing so, we acknowledge the need
to protect the commercial confi dentiality of company data. We also expect
industry to acknowledge that the planning data we provide is just that. It will
be off ered on a ‘without commitment’ basis and comes with a ‘health warning’:
to refl ect changes to the environment within which our Armed Forces operate,
our plans (like those in the private sector) will vary from year to year, and
fi rm budgets cannot be set beyond the spending review period - MOD’s plans
are subject to change at regular intervals. Industry will also need to respect
the confi dence in which planning data is provided to them, in line with the
obligations and expectations that are already well-established between us and
our suppliers for handling sensitive data, and to be much sharper in focusing
its dealings with us via authorised communication channels, rather than the
much broader approach that is often adopted. In all of this, there is an explicit
recognition that the greater trust that we will be investing in industry must be
reciprocated: how industry responds will condition our approach in the future.

###### Wider factors
### A9 A9


A9.1 The Defence Industrial Policy (DIP) was founded on the importance
of equipping our Armed Forces effi ciently with the tools they require to meet
the challenges they face. This remains the fundamental starting point for the
DIS. Each year a large proportion of the defence budget is spent on procuring
and supporting equipment. It is these activities that in eff ect defi ne and delimit
our industrial policy. Above all, our relationship with the defence industry must
be rooted in project performance – ensuring that reliable and supportable
equipment is developed and delivered within time and price constraints. It
is not just the magnitude of Government defence spending but the effi cient
use of those defence resources that enables the UK to have the most eff ective
armed forces in Europe. It is not in the interests of the taxpayer or our Armed
Forces for an industrial policy to dilute this fundamental principle. We also need
to recognise, however, not only individual project priorities, but the complete
interaction between Government and industry. And we need to be aware of the
cumulative impact of potential decisions about individual projects on industry.

A9.2 It is fi rmly within this context that the Government seeks to
maximise economic benefi t to the UK from defence expenditure, by the
development of technological skills, the creation of intellectual property,
and an increase in the investment in the UK industry derived from
exports. The Government recognises the contribution that a vibrant and
innovative defence industry makes to employment, the economy and the
national science and technology base. In particular, we aim to sustain
an environment which will enhance the competitiveness of industry.


###### Wider factors
### A9


A9.4 The DIP laid out the key factors to be taken into account in
acquisition decisions:

¬ **operational eff ectiveness and cost, whole-life not just**
initial acquisition cost, to assess value for money. The tool for
assessing this is usually a Combined Operational Eff ectiveness
and Investment Appraisal (COEIA), combining operational
analysis and standard investment appraisal techniques;


A9.3 This DIS covers three areas in which we can promote these goals:

¬ **making the UK business environment attractive for investors**
**to invest in our defence industry (which we continue to**
defi ne as in the DIP – i.e. embracing all defence suppliers that
create value, employment, technology or intellectual assets in the
UK, including both UK and foreign-owned companies). Chapter
A4 explains how the Government, as a supporter, regulator,
planner, customer and investor, is pursuing this. Some of the
measures include, but are not limited to, the defence industry;
for instance, we have specifi c strategies for manufacturing and
technology, which include the defence industry, and the UK’s stable
macroeconomic environment is attractive to investors in all sectors;


¬ our policy is clear that value for money is considered over the long**term and wider than that for individual projects, and in particular**
that any decision that would impact on our ability to compete future
requirements needs to be considered very carefully. It also emphasises
that there are a number of capabilities which for national security reasons
we would place a high priority on retaining within the UK industrial
base. The DIS builds on that policy by setting out in detail the industrial
capabilities we wish to maintain, and clarifi es that these two issues are
often linked; any decision which fails to sustain a desired capability in the
UK may aff ect both long-term value for money and national security.

A9.5 It also specifi ed the wider factors be taken into account, which
are declared and explained to potential bidders at the earliest opportunity.
The critical issue is that we carefully consider the potential impact on wider
national objectives before inviting industry to tender or invest signifi cantly in
a project (otherwise over time, industry’s confi dence that our decisions will
be fair and transparent will decline, with knock-on consequences for value for
money and military capability). Consideration of wider factors applies equally
in cases where prime contractors run competitions on behalf of the MOD.


###### Security of supply

A9.6 We need to ensure that we can support equipment, or produce
expendables (e.g. munitions), in times of confl ict (predicated on an
assumption that we understand the dependencies within the supply chain,
where in some cases we need to do further work with industry). High levels of
onshore technology and capacity may often off er greater comfort in security
of supply and the ability to undertake modifi cations in response to short-term
operational demand. This applies as much to support as to initial procurement.


¬ **clearly identifying those industrial capabilities which we**
**need, for national security reasons, to retain in the UK,**
**and, where these are threatened, developing sustainment**
**strategies to foster and maintain them. Part B identifi es these**
by sector, in the context of the future Defence requirements we seek
to fi ll, as covered in broad terms in Chapter A2, and the changing
industrial landscape, as described in Chapter A3 (both of which
are covered by sector in more detail in each sectoral chapter);

¬ **for specifi c procurement decisions, including designing**
**procurement strategies and setting assessment criteria for**
**competitions, ensuring that our consideration is based on**
**long-term value for money, operational eff ectiveness and**
**aff ordability, and also takes into account wider factors where**
**these are relevant. Chapter A7 gives a broad overview of how**
procurement strategies are designed; this chapter considers in more
d il h h id f id ifi d d k i


A9.7 The DIP emphasises that we need to be realistic about security of
supply advantages, recognising that increasing mutual reliance on security
of supply is inevitable for all nations. The weight to be put on security of
supply is a question of judgement case by case, taking into account the
risks involved (including any mitigation provided through collaborative
agreements such as the six nation European Letter of Intent Framework
Agreement and the US/UK Declaration of Principles Security of Supply
arrangement) and the cost implications. In some cases, the capability is
so signifi cant to our overall military eff ectiveness that we wish to retain it
onshore at least partly for that reason; security of supply, in terms of both
physical and intellectual resources, is often a critical factor in deciding
which capabilities must be sovereign. In most other cases, however,
we will need to balance the risk against any additional cost for onshore
supply on a case-by-case basis, taking into account value for money
and aff ordability. In inviting industry to bid against such requirements,
we need to avoid a ‘UK premium’ being priced into domestic bids.


-----

###### Industrial participation

A9.8 The MOD’s Industrial Participation (IP) policy can encourage
technology transfer and ensure investment in particular industrial
capabilities within the UK. Where this contributes to developing
or maintaining sovereign capabilities, IP may be a key factor in its
own right; where the benefi t is of broader industrial benefi t, it may
help discriminate between two otherwise similar propositions. If
however the benefi t is a broader industrial one, but securing it
would involve selecting an option which was worse for Defence,
then it would need to be considered in the same way as other wider
technology and industrial capability factors. It is important that MOD
has confi dence in a foreign supplier’s ability to deliver the IP off ered,
so factors including the company’s past record will be evaluated.

###### Industrial capabilities

A9.9 We continue to recognise that there are industrial capabilities
which do not meet the strict defence criteria for sustainment but
may be desirable to retain in the UK due to the high value they
bring to the industrial economy, wherever they sit in the supply
chain. Their signifi cance can be evaluated according to:

¬ their potential in world markets where the UK may gain greater market
share;

¬ the extent to which they will generate high-value added
economic activity (including its potential for attracting inward
investment and incorporation into collaborative programmes);

¬ transferability into wider commercial
applications outside defence sectors;

¬ impact on industrial activity regionally (including the number
and quality of UK-based jobs that are created or sustained).

A9.10 All business cases on equipment (including support business cases)
are required to have supporting sections considering industrial and regional
implications. Assessment of such factors must however recognise that
funding for such capabilities would be drawn from the defence budget.

###### Key Technologies

A9.11 In some cases, key underpinning technologies are important
to maintain for national security reasons, and a number are identifi ed in
Part B. MOD’s science and technology strategy necessarily focuses the
limited research funds available on investment in technologies judged
to be of most importance for defence. These technologies will often
have potential for the wider UK science base, a base also supported
through DTI science, innovation and technology programmes, and will
change over time, sometimes rapidly. Acknowledging the relationship
between military and civilian priorities and investment strategies, in part
through an ongoing engagement between MOD and DTI, is important
both for MOD’s own Technology Strategy and for formulation of the MOD
research programme and may also help identify areas for coordination
and collaboration. The interaction between military and civilian priorities
may also in some cases be relevant in other acquisition decisions.


###### Export potential

A9.12 Defence exports help to maintain key industrial capabilities
during lulls in domestic demand allowing longer production runs and
reduce the share of fi xed overheads on MOD programmes. They also
contribute to foreign and security policy interests. These benefi ts are
discussed further in chapter A6. Exports can also improve the economic
strength of the defence industry. For theses reasons, a realistic assessment
of export potential, and the benefi ts that might accrue (to Defence or
more widely) is made at the key decision points in MOD programmes.

###### Foreign and security policy interests

A9.13 Many procurement projects and collaborative ventures can be so
large in scale and political importance that they have signifi cant implications
for these interests. Choosing whether to cooperate with a particular country
in a joint programme could have consequences for the overall bilateral
relationship and an alliance’s military capability. For example, agreeing to
cooperate in a joint programme could strengthen another country’s political
commitment to their own military’s modernisation, which we would value
as part of our broader security policy because of the greater burden-sharing
that might then be possible in future combined operations. It is usually very
diffi cult to quantify foreign and security policy interests objectively and the
potential application of this heading is very wide, but they need to be assessed
and considered carefully. Given the relationship between defence and
broader security and foreign policy, a decision which is suboptimal in a narrow
consideration of the key factors may nevertheless be the best for Defence in
the round. However, the interests concerned must not be transient or trivial.

###### Wider MOD policy

A9.14 This covers a broad range of policy areas in which MOD Ministers,
or for some matters relating to internal and Armed Forces administration
the Defence Management Board, have chosen to constrain the Department’s
actions (legal obligations are of course absolute, and all business cases must
be considered for legality of the equipment including in the way we intend
that equipment to be used, but policy choices are more discretionary). For
example, to comply with MOD environmental policy, we have specifi ed that
future tanker shipping should be double-hulled, and for safety reasons, that
future munitions should be insensitive. Given knowledge of existing policy,
options will rarely be off ered which would breach Departmental policy, except
where compliance has a signifi cant impact on the key factors. Options that
required exclusions from existing policy would need discussion with the policy
lead for that area, and reference to Ministers and senior offi cials as necessary.

###### Systems Engineering

### B1


B1.1 The DIS has been developed using Key Principles, explained
in detail in Chapter A1. One of these was recognising the importance
of systems engineering, to ensure that our equipment is procured and
continues to develop through-life as a result of mature discussions
between intelligent customers and intelligent suppliers.

B1.2 In general, we need industry to have systems
engineering capability so that the UK can:


###### Systems Engineering

### B1


B1.5 As military eff ect is increasingly delivered through the interaction
of many diff erent people, equipments and information systems, all of
which will develop over time, a clear understanding of these evolving
relationships from the point of a potential need being recognised, through
development and manufacture, to the end of the solution’s service life
is essential if its design is to be balanced and high performance.

**What is systems engineering?**


integrate systems of systems;

design systems and upgrade them effi ciently through-life;


integrate sub-systems or components, in some cases
sourced from around the world, into systems;

provide a core capability from which to surge when
demand requires, e.g. to address specific requirements
for a new operation or to provide a planned
upgrade, and as new technologies emerge;


B1.6 Modern defence equipment and services delivered using equipment
generally rely on discrete elements, often complex in their own right, relating
to each other in a planned and well understood way. This combination of
diff erent elements, delivering an overall result which is greater than the sum
of its parts, is a system, and military capability is delivered through systems.

B1.7 Systems engineering is the general term for the
methods used to provide optimally engineered, operationally
eff ective, complex systems. Systems engineering balances
capability, risk, complexity, cost and technological choices to
provide a solution which best meets the customer’s needs.


###### B1


adapt systems to take advantage of new technology
and to respond to changes in the threats.

B1.3 Along with industry, we need to invest in maintaining
and growing high quality systems engineering capability, at
all levels in the supply chain where we need systems or key
sub-systems to be designed and engineered. But the level
of capability that we require onshore varies by sector.


B1.4 **In a period when platforms are likely to remain in-**
**service for many years, unless systems engineering capability**
**and vital long-term knowledge is maintained, it is little use**
**investing in cutting-edge science. New technologies will**
**have less benefi t without knowledge of how they might**
**be exploited and inserted into existing equipment.**


B1.8 As defi ned by the International Council On Systems
Engineering (INCOSE): ‘Systems Engineering is an engineering discipline
whose responsibility is creating and executing an interdisciplinary
process to ensure that the customer and stakeholder’s needs are
satisfi ed in a high quality, trustworthy, cost effi cient and schedule
compliant manner throughout a system’s entire lifecycle.’ [1]

B1.9 The through-life relevance is important; even at disposal, there
may be system safety or security issues to be considered, or we may
have to modify equipment to meet the needs of an overseas buyer.


The late US Admiral Grace Hopper, the eminent computer
scientist, educator and thinker who fi rst coined the term ‘bug’ for
a programming error, once said, ‘Life was simple before World War
II. After that, we had systems’. Despite systems engineering as a
discipline having begun its development around sixty years ago,
its scope and defi nition remain subject to debate even amongst
qualifi ed practitioners, despite attempts by the International
Council On Systems Engineering (INCOSE) to establish a ‘Consensus’
(http://www.incose.org/practice/fellowsconsensus.aspx ). Within
industry, diff erent companies (and diff erent systems engineers
within the same company!) have diff erent views on the scope of
what is meant by terms such as Systems Engineering and Systems
Integration, and the relationship between these and e.g. project
management. This chapter does not aim to create a new set of
defi nitions, but to explain what we mean by systems engineering
in the Defence Industrial context, and why it is important.


**Why does system engineering**
**matter? Initial considerations.**

B1.10 Together with the defence industry we are in the business
of delivering large, complex projects, often at the forefront of
technology. The National Audit Offi ce has documented the major
sources of diffi culty associated with the delivery of our major projects,
the majority of which are associated with technical issues. Many of
these technical issues relate to the integration of the systems involved.
Improving systems engineering is, across the industry and MOD, a high
priority if the Armed Forces are to get the equipment they need.

_with Systems Engineering; as the ICOSE consensus (see box) describes_
_integration as a discrete activity within a Systems Engineering_

-----

B1.11 Individual acquisitions are increasing in their complexity, as
technology develops and as military eff ects increasingly are delivered
through a combination of diff erent platforms, forces and information
systems.  Realising Network Enabled Capability (NEC) is all about making
diff erent capabilities work together in a coherent system, to deliver a step
change in capability. As our own systems become more complex, achieving
interoperability with our allies becomes an ever greater challenge.  Open
architectures can help manage this trend, but the underlying drivers
remain. Our priorities for our forces include fl exibility, precision, agility, and
reach. Good systems engineering (particularly in pursuit of sustainability)
can help design out unnecessary complexity, but in general, a fl exible,
precise, agile, and long-range capability, will be a complex one.

B1.12 Maintaining capability through a system’s life, often longer than
any individual’s career, requires the original understanding of the system
to be retained, with the basic rationale for previous trade-off s, and the
dynamics of the relationship of the system’s parts, captured and understood.
Only by doing this can the implications of integrating new equipment be
understood, and opportunities seen for inserting previously unavailable
technology to improve the system’s safety and performance or drive out cost.

**Systems engineering and prime contractors**

It is very important not to confuse the concept of a systems
engineering entity with that of prime contractor.

A prime contractor is the legal entity whom we require to deliver a
product, e.g. a fully functioning ship, or service. A systems engineering
capability requires high calibre engineering skills, a suite of modern
organisational, modelling and simulation processes and tools, and
access to facilities to test and prove the system in all aspects of its
operation. Firms acting as prime contractors will often possess much
of this capability, but there is no necessary reason why the prime
contractor for a specifi c equipment or service should not subcontract
some or all systems engineering tasks to another fi rm or group of fi rms,
or why they should have to own all the relevant facilities, provided
they have assured access to them. The optimal relationship between
prime contractors and systems engineers is considered further below.

B1.13 The complexity of the systems engineering tasks necessary
to deliver military capability diff ers by sector, with a nuclearpowered submarine perhaps representing the largest, most complex
and highly integrated platform system, compared to a relatively
simple Armoured Fighting Vehicle (AFV), with more limited systems
complexity. The trend is nevertheless clearly towards greater
**systems complexity across all sectors, and the latest AFVs**
may now include a range of interdependent sensors and electronic
sub-systems, and a huge number of lines of software code.

**Diff erent levels of systems engineering**

B1.14 Ultimately, we have to be able to bring together our resources,
information and the operation of diff erent force elements to deliver
military eff ects. To ensure the desired eff ects are available, planners
have to take into account the Defence Lines of Development:

Training;

Equipment;
Personnel;

I f i


Concepts and Doctrine;
Organisation;
Infrastructure;
Logistics.

B1.15 The provision of the equipment capability is only one element
therefore of military capability, and the development and operation
of military capability is a system in its own right. Those charged with
delivering the equipment element have to ensure that it is consistent
with what the other Lines of Development can deliver, in a dynamic
relationship. This coordination is part of our core business, but those
designing and developing equipment capability have to take them into
account, and understand the customer’s needs, constraints, and intentions.

B1.16 Systems engineering typologies can be drawn up
concentrating on, for instance, operational, industrial, business,
project, or technical aspects. Given the different perspectives
possible, systems engineering is as relevant in designing a
software chip as it is for considering development of the military
strategy for a particular conflict or the future force structure.

B1.17 Equipment therefore needs to fi t into a broader system
with the other Lines of Development, and diff erent perspectives
are possible (e.g. an aircraft can be considered a system in its
own right, or part of the system-of-systems that is its squadron,
including ground crew, supply chain, information network etc).

B1.18 Nevertheless, signifi cant equipment programmes generally
represent complex systems in their own right. A number of diff erent
perspectives can be taken, and it is traditional to talk about ‘Tier 1’ or
‘prime systems integration’ systems – which tend to be platforms – and
‘Tier 2’, which are (often still complex) systems incorporated into platforms.
This is generally illustrated by a ‘V-diagram’ like the one opposite:

������������������������������

������������

���������������������������������������� ���������� ���������������������������������� ��������

������������������������������������������������ ������ ��������������������������

�����������������

����������������������� ������������������
������������� ��������������������

������������
�������������������� ������������������
���������

B1.19 One defi nition of Tier 1 is as ‘the level of major systems that
**support key defence capabilities, and which are supplied directly to**
**the military user (e.g. a military aircraft, helicopter, warship, vehicle,**
**guided weapon, satellite, standalone sensor or C3I system)’.  However,**
this makes clear that this typology is descriptive rather than defi nitive; systems
are put into tiers based on how we have traditionally contracted for a system.

B1.20 This risks confusion; e.g. guided weapons are clearly complex,
and are generally contracted for separately from the platform(s) they
reside in, but they do not represent military capability until incorporated
onto those platforms - and usually, into an information network, either
via the platform or directly. Nevertheless, the defence industry still tends
to be structured around ‘Tier 1’ and ‘Tier 2’ products. Below Tier 2, there
may be decreasing levels of complexity or less specifi c military features,
il h i b i d i ff i l di i l


-----

B1.21 In the remainder of this chapter, to establish a consistent
typology and to avoid potential confusion between what is
a Tier 1 and Tier 2 system, we distinguish between:

**partial systems: these have independent purpose, but are**
only viable in the context of a containing system. For instance,
an air-launched missile has an independent purpose, but
is only viable if integrated with an aircraft platform;


**sub-systems: systems which only have a purpose as part of a containing**
system. For example, an engine only has a purpose – providing the
power to move a platform – if incorporated into that platform;

a system: one which has a purpose and is viable in its own right. An
example, from an equipment perspective, is a fast-jet combat aircraft.
We will generally talk about platform systems – in the military
sense, as the single viable equipment units, usually capable of
independent movement – though examples include satellites, as well
as vehicles, aircraft, ships and submarines. Network systems also
exist, however; a Wide Area Network fi ts this defi nition of a system;


performance, then this may be less important. Similarly, engineers
of partial systems and sub-systems may not always require deep
understanding of the overall system, though if they have this they
can contribute to the overall challenge of optimising the system.

Partial or sub-systems can be highly complex in themselves. For
instance, the Rolls-Royce EJ200 turbofan engine pictured below
was designed by selecting European centres of excellence in
gas turbine subsystem design and whole engine integration.
Rolls-Royce integrates whole engine performance, utilising the
expertise of four leading engine manufacturers sharing their
technical responsibilities and know how to ensure the EJ200’s
competitiveness. It includes advanced features such as:

a fan design that gives high stability without
the need for Inlet Guide Vanes;

blisks (a one-piece disk-and-blades engineered
from a single piece of material);

wide-chord aerofoils;
single crystal blades;
an airspray combustion system;
an integral Full Authority Digital Engine Control.

Partial and sub-systems can also be major contributors to the
military capability sought: a guided weapon, for instance, fails
or succeeds depending on the sophistication of its sensors.

B1.24 However, at each level of the process, some degree of
understanding of the systems engineering task at the next tier
above and below is generally implied, even if it is only to act as
an intelligent customer and be fully aware of the problem to be
solved and all the potential solutions. Although many of the
tools and techniques of systems engineering are generic, their
application will often need specifi c expertise in the relevant sector.


a system of systems **(SOS): these contain systems which**
have purpose and are viable independent of the SOS, but which
can when acting together perform functions unachievable by
the individual systems acting alone. For instance, the future
aircraft carrier, combining its aircraft carrier group with its own
sensors, communications and command systems and weaponry
and interacting with wider networks, represents a SOS[2].

B1.22 The growing importance of networks and their interaction with
partial systems in particular may make a platform-centric perspective
less useful in future when considering how to meet operational capability
requirements, and where the critical interfaces between systems may
reside. Some systems, particularly those which seek to integrate a number
of diff erent sensors and weapons systems across platforms, are likely to
require deeper and more complex integration into their platforms and
into networks. This may sometimes require deep knowledge of the subsystems involved and their potential contribution to military capability,
separate from their physical integration into a platform system.

###### One rule of thumb used in industry is that ‘a good systems engineer understands the details that are being addressed at least two levels below him and one level above him’

B1.23 Engineers of platform systems do not always need a deep level
of understanding of the partial systems or sub-systems; it depends
on the criticality of the partial or sub-system concerned and the
system architecture being used. If the architecture has clearly defi ned

B1.25 We now expect our platforms to endure in-service for long periods,
supported by both regular and operation-specifi c upgrades. At the same
time, technology, particularly in electronics, continues to evolve rapidly.
This may imply that the most signifi cant opportunities for upgrading
capability will be identifi ed and resolved at a) the systems of systems, or
b) the partial systems and sub-systems level, rather than being driven
by fundamental modifi cations to a platform architecture. Maintaining
knowledge of the system as a whole, and a Design Authority, is a crucial
enabler to this – if the implications of modifying a sub-system for the
system as a whole are unknown, it will not be safe to incorporate the
change, and the platform systems engineer may remain best placed to
identify areas for investigation to drive out cost and improve availability.
But the innovation and ability to exploit technology development and
improve other aspects of military capability may increasingly reside
at these lower, partial system and sub-system, levels. This is why the
model places all the diff erent dimensions within the context of military
capability; those with the relevant engineering knowledge in all domains
also have to understand the operational challenges, if they are to be able
to identify opportunities and the highest priorities for investment.

B1.26 The recognition of the importance of some sub-systems and partial
systems also means that once equipment is in service, notwithstanding
the potentially closer relationship between the engineer of the platform
system (who has traditionally been the prime contractor for the capability)
and the MOD, both have a clear interest in managing the supply chain very
closely. This is not only to drive out unnecessary cost, but also to ensure
key underlying industrial capabilities are maintained, and sub-system/
partial systems engineers share the motivation to improve equipment
through-life. This is not achieved if the engineer of the platform system
or the prime contractor can exercise inappropriate dominant power.
Rather, it implies that, where contracting arrangements can be suitably
designed, the platform engineer should only be rewarded for the value
that it adds (including, if the prime contractor, in managing the supply
chain), with innovation rewarded where it arises, so partial systems and
sub-systems engineers share the incentives for continuous improvement.

B1.27 The capability to engineer at the platform systems level
does not, therefore, of itself imply a vertically integrated supply
chain. To ensure all avenues of innovation are available, vertical
integration could sometimes be counter-productive.

The systems engineering challenge in Defence equipment is
increasing, as platforms have longer planned in-service lives, but
h l i ll l i i l idl


The complexity varies by sector, from those where the overall
performance of a single platform in a demanding environment
(e.g. underwater, air) is the critical function, to those where the
platform is a relatively simple host for a range of partial systems
and sub-systems which deliver a variety of military eff ects.

In most cases, the key opportunities for technology insertion
are likely to come at the partial systems/sub-systems layer,
but these can only be investigated if the systems engineering
knowledge of the overall system architecture is maintained.

Depending on the likely sources of capability-advancing
innovation, partial systems and sub-systems engineers need
a good understanding of the overall military context and
the problems the military customer is trying to address. It
is in MOD’s interest to promote this. They also need to
share the incentives for continuous improvement.

Platforms and their partial systems and sub-systems increasingly
have to operate in a networked environment, where systems
of systems are reconfi gured to deal with new opportunities,
often at short notice. This creates challenges by potentially
changing the military context for a particular system, but the
added complexity at the technical level can be mitigated by
the use of open architectures and common standards.

**The strategic importance of platform**
**systems engineering**

B1.28 In defence, even ‘commodity’-like items can require deep
systems engineering capability to deliver; for instance, the design and
production of current and new generation microchips is a highly complex
task. A deep understanding of commodity engineering is not, however,
a general requirement.  The UK also has a number of partial systems and
sub-systems suppliers with successful relationships with international
platform systems suppliers and who, on the strength of their technology
and engineering capability, compete eff ectively in the global market.

B1.29 There are in contrast relatively few defence companies with
signifi cant proven platform systems level capability.  The importance of
systems engineering at this level is not just as an eff ective and necessary
discipline to ensure programmes are delivered to time, cost and quality.
In many areas, it is fundamental to delivering the other Key Principles
of the DIS. The platform, after all, represents the physical, viable unit,
within which all the partial systems and sub-systems come together.

**Appropriate sovereignty.**

**Operational independence and being an intelligent**
**customer. Systems engineering capability is central to**
understanding whether the system will operate as you
want it to, when delivered, and as it evolves through
life; it may not always be possible to tell this simply by
independent testing. This applies both for initial purchase
and for support and upgrades. Having reliable access
to this capability within the UK, particularly for Urgent
Operational Requirements, is generally a high priority.

**Avoiding the ‘captive customer’ risk. Relying on an overseas**
platform systems engineer could limit the ability to develop and
upgrade equipment to meet unique UK requirements, unless
there are credible and clear contractual and political guarantees.
I b d b h i

here[3]. But in the worst case, reliance on an overseas systems
engineer could lock us into having to agree to inappropriate,
unwanted and expensive changes in confi guration, or risk the
systems engineer withdrawing support from older variants.

**Strategic industrial infl uence. Without an onshore candidate platform**
systems engineer, our negotiating leverage in procuring equipment
competitively in the global market would be markedly reduced and
we could be exposed to overseas monopolies. And in cooperative
programmes, it is important to be able to participate meaningfully
on an equal or near-equal footing with international partners.


**The why-knowledge and why-not-knowledge**

According to the Defence Scientifi c Advisory Council: ‘Without strong
leadership and fi rm goals, eff orts to manage knowledge spiral down
because they rarely provide enough short-term benefi t. A classic
example is the way engineers skimp on capturing the rationale for
decisions, the “why-knowledge” and “why-not-knowledge”. Without
such knowledge it is often impossible to know later whether one can
safely modify a system. But for the engineers at the time, recording
such knowledge is a chore, and for a company the eff ort detracts
from project delivery and profi t.’ Both MOD and industry need clear
goals and strong leadership to maintain vital long-term knowledge.


**National provision. In some areas, overseas sourcing**
is impossible, for legal or security reasons. The ability to
develop such systems has to be maintained on shore.

B1.30 Given all these considerations, maintaining a UK systems
engineering capability in defence sectors has a broader political and
strategic impact: it signifi es the UK’s status as a major defence nation;
it allows the UK to bring to coalition operations unique or distinctive
capabilities; and in some areas like nuclear submarines, it allows the UK to
produce strategically signifi cant, complex systems which are not available,
or which we would not wish to source, from the international market.


B1.33 **Maintaining key industrial capabilities and skills in turn**
depends on this knowledge being captured, refreshed, and utilised even
when the next major platform of that type is not foreseen for many years.

In the past, a steady succession of new platform systems and midlife
updates maintained these; now the gaps between one platform and
the next are generally much longer. MOD and industry increasingly
need to work closely together to maintain this capability.


B1.31 **Through life capability management cannot be**
eff ectively delivered without a platform systems engineer that
understands not only the systems architecture, but the reasons it
developed as it did. The necessary knowledge may be lost at:

individual level (retirements, resignations, deaths and the normal
process of forgetting, or not realising what is important),

collective level (through the break-up of established
teams, the outsourcing of functional areas, or a change
in ownership of part or all of a business),
or, even when the knowledge has been recorded in a
suitable form, through the loss of archived knowledge
(actual loss, accidental destruction, physical deterioration,
or being captured on obsolete media).


###### B1


B1.32 Addressing these risks requires the importance of the knowledge
to be recognised, and MOD and industry to set the right incentives for
its documentation, and transfer. Without this, equipment may become
obsolete unnecessarily early, because no-one understands well enough
how it might be modifi ed. Designing equipment with through-life
capability management in mind may even change the design adopted,
as it can be designed to make future modifi cations easier, for instance
through using open architectures and international standards.

_3  For instance if the costs of maintaining a diff erent UK confi guration compared_
_to others in a cooperative programme were poor value, or we were still able_
_h_ _UK_ _ifi h_ _i_ _f_ _li_


This means aligning incentives better, and changing business
models. Vital domain-specifi c platform systems engineering
information will not be maintained if industry brings together
its ‘A Team’ for the initial acquisition and production but then
moves this on to the next major programme; but equally, a
company cannot be expected to keep its best people employed
maintaining skills which we value but which do not refl ect the
**best short-term return available to the company.**

However, moves in the Defence Logistic Organisation to contract for
**availability and the use of equipment rather than the production of**
spares, demonstrate that industry can be incentivised to maintain systems
engineering knowledge, at both platform systems level (as usually
embedded within the original prime contractor) and lower levels, to keep
working on improving reliability to reduce cost to MOD and increase profi t
to their shareholders. And as industry sees that we are able to insert new
capability rapidly as technology develops, it will be motivated to invest
its own resources, alongside our research, to help us understand the
opportunities and off er unsolicited proposals for improving our capability.


Similarly, this proposition off ers potentially interesting career
**paths for individuals; gaining deep knowledge, but investigating**
the application of exciting new technology into existing platform
systems, as well as more traditional Post Design Services.

This model of activity needs the focus an entity at platform
systems level can bring, to coordinate and promote research, and
to identify and plan to develop the critical technologies, teams and
skills (some of which may be deep in the supply chain) to realise
these commercial opportunities and maintain defence capability.


-----

systems engineers would be concerned to use their own national
resources, and overseas governments will often naturally have
a policy concern to favour their own technology suppliers, not
least to ensure that their industry can export without external
constraint. This would leave UK SMEs in particular without an
easy route to market for their innovation, with consequences
both for Defence and the wider UK science and technology base.


**_Apache assembly._**


**Contracting for availability**

Our operational experience highlights the importance of reliability.
We are procuring generally more reliable equipment and,
consequently, there is a reduced requirement for moving spare parts
and replacement equipment. Less broken equipment being sent
back for repair also reduces pressure on the supply chain. It also
means moving towards a system whereby we pay for availability
**not repairs. In the past equipment has been procured with two**
separate contracts, one for delivery and one for repair. This does
not clearly incentivise the delivery of reliable equipment. We are
moving to a single contract system, by which suppliers are paid
for use of equipment. A recent example of this is the £600m
private fi nance initiative for ‘C-Vehicles’, under which the Amey Lex
Consortium will provide heavy plant equipment, logistic support
and construction machines over a 15-year period on a rapid fl eet
turnover basis. This will reduce maintenance and support costs.

Companies are generally keen to move towards this model. While
it off ers us greater equipment availability, it also provides our
industrial partners greater returns over a longer period. The
Chief of Defence Logistics’ intention is to spread this business,
where it is appropriate, across the whole support area.


**Overseas systems engineers**

The Defence Industrial Policy states that the UK defence industry
should be defi ned in terms of where the technology is created, where
the skills and the intellectual property reside, where jobs are created
and sustained, and where the investment is made. Thus an ‘overseas
systems engineer’ in this context is a company where the key systems
engineering capabilities, including the relevant intellectual property,
are outside the UK. That includes companies which might have
signifi cant presence in the UK, e.g. manufacturing facilities, and in all
other senses be considered part of the UK defence industry. It would
equally include primarily UK-based or co-owned companies which
moved their systems engineering capability and associated IP off shore.

That does not mean that overseas companies could not off er
their products in areas where we specifi ed a requirement for a
platform or other systems engineering capability in the UK, either
by establishing it themselves (although the barriers to entry may
be high), or by acquisition, licensing or partnership with a fi rm
that does have such capabilities onshore. For instance, it has
long been important for the MOD to be able to modify, often for
Urgent Operational Requirements, its C-130K Hercules aircraft,
originally bought from the United States forty years ago. This has
been achieved through the Sister Design Authority[4] established by
Marshall of Cambridge for the original C-l30K purchase. Marshall has
carried out over 1,000 upgrades, modifi cations and new equipment
additions to the RAF’s fl eet and has attracted substantial further
work from overseas because of its acknowledged expertise.


B1.34 Maintaining engineering capability at the platform
systems level can also provide Value for Defence.

This model of an incentivised platform systems engineer
working to develop a design for ease of upgrade
and support should directly improve potential
**equipment capability and reduce costs to us.**

It may in turn also improve export prospects, potentially for
the mutual advantage of us and industry. This issue is explored
further in the supporting chapter on defence exports.

Having a domestic capability at platform systems level also
assists in securing Value for Defence in competitive global
procurements.  Unless the UK has this itself, it will be viewed as
an ‘export market’. Without the focus that a domestic platform
systems-level engineering capability can provide, the value
**gained from our research is likely to decline, as might national**
i i i h l h i Thi i b l f


B1.35 **Change on both sides. As implied in the above discussion,**
ensuring the retention of systems engineering capability in the
UK is in general important but needs, for implementation, to be
underpinned by diff erent behaviours in both us and industry.

In industry, amongst other things, it requires clear leadership
and investing in maintaining and refreshing skills
**and knowledge, and a marketing mindset – helping**
anticipate MOD’s and export customers’ needs and fi nding
suitable solutions, rather than relying on known future
programmes and being told the system requirements.

For us, it implies allowing increased profi t for industry in
conjunction with reduced costs, aligning with industry
to support, through minor programmes and research, the
maintenance and development of vital knowledge.


It also means demonstrating that we can be disciplined
enough not to ask for overly demanding specifi cations
at fi rst delivery, while being agile and fl exible enough
to be able to react when industry does produce sensible
proposals for rapidly taking advantage of new technology.
These challenges are considered further in Part C.

**Industry overview**


B1.36 We have discussed the strategic importance of systems engineering,
and outlined a potential vision in which a UK systems engineering capability,
particularly at platform systems level, can help sustain the Key Principles
of the DIS. The vision however needs to be rooted in the real world of the
industry as it currently is, and the available methods for engaging with it.

B1.37 Systems engineering is a complex task involving a mix of
generalised skills and resources (including project and programme
management and standardised systems engineering techniques) and
domain-specifi c knowledge and facilities, including test and evaluation
facilities which are discussed in another chapter. Very few countries
outside the US are able to support more than one capability at the platform
systems level in any specifi c sector, and even in the US the largest systems
engineers still tend to concentrate on a limited number of sectors.


B1.39 It is important to emphasise that this is a view of the current
state of the industry. In implementing the DIS, Government and industry
will need to do more work to refi ne in detail the knowledge (including
IP), skills, facilities and capacity required, and identify where these
reside. There is no reason in principle why additional capable systems
engineering capabilities at platform systems level could not emerge in the
UK, for instance if an overseas supplier of a new equipment established
such a capability onshore. Thus, the fact that BAE Systems has supplied
95% of the UK’s current Armoured Fighting Vehicles and is the only
current on shore engineer of systems in this sector does not mean that
another company could not establish that capability for future projects,
provided we could access the intellectual property design authority
and capability to upgrade or adapt those future vehicles as required,
including against demanding timescales. Equally, there is no reason in
principle why the systems engineering capabilities currently embedded
in these companies should have to remain where they currently are.

**Sustaining the capability to engineer systems**


B1.40 The proposed way forward is explained in each sector
chapter. However, it is important to emphasise again that, where we
say there is a national requirement to retain a capability to engineer
at the systems level, whether for upgrading in-service equipment
only or also for new projects, that does not of itself imply a particular
model for engaging that capability. In some sectors, it will not be
**necessary, possible or cost-eff ective to retain this capability.**


###### B1


B1.38 The industrial overview for each sector is explained in more
detail in the relevant chapter, and there are a number of companies which
can contribute diff erent capabilities: for example, BMT, QinetiQ and Three
Quays have some profi ciency in naval systems engineering, and naval
maintenance also requires understanding the systems design. But across
the piece, the domain-specifi c capability at platform systems level within
the UK defence industry is currently primarily concentrated as follows:

**The relationship between systems engineering**
**capability and prime contractors**

B1.41 We have noted throughout that being able to engineer
capability at a systems level, and prime contracting, are not necessarily
synonymous. Nor is there a simple model of the degree of vertical
integration that is desirable. However, taking into account diff erent levels
of systems complexity and the overview above of potential methods of
engaging with industry, we can identify some general principles:

for new projects, where the platform is itself highly complex
and both physical and other aspects of integrating the partial
systems and sub-systems are challenging, the engineer designing
the system is likely to require a very close understanding of
both the partial systems/sub-systems and the manufacturing
process. As the inter-relationship between sub-systems and the
overall system is complex, similar or identical knowledge is likely
to reside at many levels. Over time, industry may fi nd it most
effi cient to consolidate to remove unnecessary duplication.

However, in sectors where the relationship between platform and
sub-systems/partial systems is less complex, and in particular
where innovation is being driven primarily at the sub-systems/
partial systems level, it may be benefi cial to keep the systems
engineering tasks separate from the platform manufacturer, to
ensure maximum openness to innovation from other suppliers.
This might imply a design house construct, or an alliance
(consortium, joint venture, or looser arrangement) where tasks,
roles, risks and rewards are shared between members.

It is generally desirable, and often essential, for the UK to have an
on shore engineer of the overall system, particularly for supporting
equipment in-service. However, even where the MOD has procured
overwhelmingly from a UK-based supplier before, if the competitive
environment is healthy, then unless other considerations prevent
overseas supply[5], there is no reason in principle why another
supplier could not establish a similar capability in the UK for new
equipment. The existing base is likely in most cases though to
give the current supplier in that sector a competitive advantage.

Where a competition is kept open to overseas suppliers or a
cooperative arrangement is pursued, unless the cost of retaining
national fl exibility is prohibitive or we are content to maintain
the same confi guration as another nation, MOD and industry
must ensure that all necessary systems-level engineering
knowledge to support and upgrade the equipment once in
service is shared with an on shore systems engineer.

Innovation once in-service, both for improving availability and
enhancing other aspects of military capability, requires access to
the overall systems-level knowledge, but may not occur uniquely
in a platform manufacturer. This is particularly the case for systems
where the platform is relatively less complex but the sub-systems
and partial systems have decisive infl uence on the military capability
sought. In such cases, it will be particularly important either that the
contractual mechanisms allow value to fl ow through to the layers
which are actually producing the innovation, or that sub-system/
partial system engineers are able to tender for upgrades directly.

_i h_ _li_ _i_ _h i_ _i_ _i_


**Applying this analysis across the sectors**

B1.42 This analysis demonstrates and explains the diff erent
conclusions across the individual sectors considered in this Strategy.

B1.43 Submarines are extremely complex, rely on sensitive technology,
and critical aspects cannot be procured from off shore for security reasons.
The sector is currently split into a number of monopoly suppliers (BAE
Systems, DML, Rolls-Royce Marine) which contract direct with MOD, which
is in turn a monopsony for the systems, sub-systems and partial systems
provided, though total on-shore manufacture of every item is not required.
Each of the main suppliers, and the submarine support business, is likely
to contain some elements of the critical systems engineering knowledge.
Opportunities exist for greater effi ciency here, combined with action
to establish a more consistent workfl ow.  However, industry needs to
reshape itself to protect both the systems engineering and manufacturing
capability but in a more coherent and effi cient form, with signifi cant
increases in productivity. The model needs to evolve, with industry,
towards nomination of a single preferred systems engineering entity.

B1.44 We require a capability in UK industry to engineer complex surface
ships at systems level, with enough familiarity with the manufacturing
process to be able to fulfi l that function. We have in recent years operated
a system of competition in stages by project. However, again there is more
capacity in the industry than will be required in a few years, and the systems
engineering capability is likely to be duplicated and sub-optimised across
several companies. Nor are potential synergies with support business being
realised, despite largely the same companies being involved. The systems
engineering capability needs, along with the rest of the industrial capability
in this sector, to be refocused to maximise the relationship between in-service
support and upgrade, and sized based on MOD’s future needs and a realistic
assessment of military export potential, if it is to maximise productivity.

B1.45 In the Armoured Fighting Vehicles sector, BAE Systems Land
Systems has supplied 95% of the current inventory, and the associated
systems engineering knowledge needs maintaining and developing;
we will work further with the company to investigate mechanisms
for ensuring this. However, the global market for future AFVs remains
competitive, with much scope for innovation and new technology in
FRES in particular.  When these future systems are brought into service,
a systems engineering capability will be required with the highest levels
of systems engineering, skills, resources and capabilities based in the
UK. The same features – high concentration of knowledge relating to
the existing fl eet, but a healthy international competitive environment
– apply to the helicopter industry, where AgustaWestland’s systems
engineering capability needs sustainment in the short term and where
partnership to drive improvements in support to the current fl eet is
natural, but competition remains an option for the medium term.

B1.46 In the general munitions sector, BAE Systems has the vast
majority of the existing business, but there remain niche capabilities
abroad which may meet future needs. We have therefore adopted
partnerships with BAE Systems and other suppliers for support of the
current inventory and are considering ways in which we can rationalise
the through-life management of munitions, without ruling out the
prospect of global competition for future projects at this stage.


-----

**_Hercules C-130J under construction._**

B1.47  For C4ISTAR there are a number of healthy companies with
systems engineering skills in the UK, and given civil opportunities in this
sector global competition by project seems likely to be sustainable for the
foreseeable future. A similar picture applies for CBRN, where it is possible
that partnering may off er some opportunities, but where competitive
approaches are sustainable should these not demonstrate improved value.


B1.48  The challenge in complex weapons is whether the capability
can be sustained. In principle, this is of high priority to us. But unless
industry can restructure and deliver a viable proposition within the funds
available, we may have to accept that we cannot sustain this capability
onshore, recognising the implications for operational sovereignty that would
entail. We have however decided that while we require this capability for
in-service torpedoes, we do not require a sovereign capability on shore to
systems engineer complete future torpedoes, though we do require the
capability to engineer and integrate the algorithms and homing heads.

B1.49 In aerospace, we require onshore systems engineering capability to
support through-life our existing and planned fast combat jets, although in
the case of the Joint Strike Fighter this is limited to the ability to integrate
and upgrade UK weapons onto the system as part of Team Lockheed (with
our interest – on both cost and military eff ectiveness grounds – lying very
clearly in preserving system capability commonality and coherence with
the US). As such we regard it as essential to work with BAE Systems – the
only company in the UK able to contribute at the top tier to international
programmes in this sector – to sustain its systems engineering understanding
of these platforms. But we will also attach importance to sustaining the
systems engineering capabilities at the partial and sub-systems level
– which in certain cases reside elsewhere in the supply chain – that will
be required to provide for their maintenance and upgrade through-life.

###### Strategic overview

B2.2 The 2004 Defence White Paper, ‘Delivering Security in a Changing
_World – Future Capabilities’, emphasised the importance of versatile maritime_
expeditionary forces to project power across the globe in support of British
interests and delivering eff ect on to land at a time and place of our choosing.
Future maritime operations are likely to follow a similar, expeditionary pattern
to those conducted recently. The sea off ers an opportunity for UK Forces to
operate with a degree of security and persistence, without reliance on the
territory of others for basing. These factors, in particular the need for freedom
to operate in an uncertain world, make the sea a very attractive location
from which to project power. To take advantage of this the Royal Navy will
in future need to be an agile, network enabled expeditionary force able to
switch between missions and tasks and to interoperate with chosen allies.
The force will have the ability to deliver and sustain a full range of missions:
from small highly focussed interventions with Special Forces, to large, high
intensity coalition operations, securing key infl uence in the process. This
versatile maritime force will be capable of winning safe theatre entry for the
deployment of joint forces. Through amphibious operations and a full range
of medium scale off ensive air eff ort, the versatile maritime force will deliver
Maritime Strike and Littoral Manoeuvre to achieve decisive eff ect on the land.

programme that will enhance the capabilities of the RN. It has
particular emphasis on fewer but more capable platforms, focusing

B2.4 The two planned Future Carriers **(CVF) will be the biggest surface**
ships ever to be built in the UK - and will carry a strike package of Joint
Combat Aircraft (JCA). The CVF programme is subject to an incremental
approvals process: Target In-service Dates (ISD) for the two vessels will
be agreed when the manufacture phase is approved. Given that both
France and the UK are embarking on major, complex carrier procurement
projects, we are examining areas of mutual benefi t and opportunities to
deliver economies. It is for industry to put forward proposals which will
be judged on their merits and in light of national policies. It has been
agreed with France that for co-operation to work, it must deliver cost
savings and must do so without delaying UK or French programmes.

###### In 8 days the RN assembled off the coast of Africa a Joint Force of over 3000 RN, Royal Marines, Royal Fleet Auxiliary and RAF personnel, in support of the UN in Sierra Leone

B2.5 The Type 45 Destroyer will provide the RN’s primary Anti
Air Warfare capability for over thirty years. It is a versatile warship that
will provide exceptional detection and air defence capability when the
fi rst of class, HMS DARING, enters service . This capability is centred
on the Principal Anti Air Missile System (PAAMS), delivered through a
collaborative consortium in EUROPAAMS; and SAMPSON, a UK Multi
Function Radar under development with BAE Systems. Up to eight
Type 45 Destroyers are planned to enter service in the next decade.

B2.6 A Future Surface Combatant (FSC) study is looking at how
the capability currently provided by the Type 22 and Type 23 frigates
might be met in the future. No decisions have been taken, but our current
assumption for planning purposes is a two class platform solution. The
**Future Mine Counter-Measures Capability is also being examined.**

B2.7 The Astute Class will be the most advanced and powerful
attack submarines the Royal Navy has ever operated and will play
a key part in our defences for decades to come. With improved
communications, a greater capacity for joint operations and the
ability to carry more weaponry, the Astute-class submarines
will deliver a marked increase in the flexibility of our attack
submarines. Three Astute Class nuclear powered submarines are on
contract with BAE Systems and due in-service in 2009, 2010 and
2012, with potential for a further 5, subject to affordability.

B2.8 The future Amphibious Capability will be built around specialist
shipping consisting of two Landing Platform Docks (LPD), one Landing
**Platform Helicopter (LPH), an Invincible Class aircraft carrier in the**
LPH role, and four Landing Ship Dock(Auxiliary) (LSD(A)). The LSD(A)
class is expected to remain in-service for around 25 years. Additionally,
CVF will be deployable in a secondary role as a Helicopter Carrier.

work has diminished as a result of force level rationalisation, but the planned
life extension of Surface Combatants moderates the reduction out to 2030. The
level of future support still represents signifi cant opportunities for UK industry.

###### Indicative planning assumptions

B2.9 The Military Afl oat Reach and Sustainability (MARS)
programme is a signifi cant planned investment in a new integrated
approach to Afl oat Support, combined with investment in life extensions
for retained platforms. The MARS system-of-systems may include Fleet
Tankers, Joint Sea Based Logistics and Fleet Solid Support vessels.


B2.10 **Type 23 Frigate Capability Upgrade Programme is**
complementary to the FSC concept and potentially extends the life of the
Type 23 Frigate. Capability upgrades are planned for the combat system,
with updates to address structural strength and platform systems to follow.

B2.11 The Trafalgar **Class SSNs (nuclear powered submarines)**
are nearing completion of a world-leading sonar and combat
system improvement programme. This will ensure the submarines
remain eff ective for the remaining life of the class.

**_Vanguard submarine._**


B2.16 The assumed spend profi le in the maritime sector is expected to
grow over the next ten years, providing a very strong programme of work
for UK shipbuilding as T45, Astute, CVF and MARS work comes on line. This
is followed by a longer term downturn as these major programmes come to
an end. As a customer, we cannot aff ord and do not need to maintain the
current pace of successive new platforms once the new ships are in service.
This has implications for both new procurement and the volume of support
business required. As the graph demonstrates, a very signifi cant amount
of resources - around half the amount the Department spends annually
on the maritime sector - are consumed in supporting naval equipment.

###### What is required for retention in the UK industrial base?

B2.17 Retention of onshore capability is driven by two fundamental
strategic requirements: the need to develop and support military capability
throughout its life; and the ability to mount operations from the UK base.
To meet these two requirements we have identifi ed six strategic themes
supported by a breakdown of specifi c capabilities. Where these are at a high
level the maintenance of each capability is critically dependent upon retaining
access to associated skills, facilities, processes and underlying technologies.


B2.13 Capability investigations are underway, exploring
the utility of Minor War Vessels for Maritime Interdiction
Operations and an Anti-Fast Inshore Attack Craft capability.

B2.14 The Off shore Patrol Vessel replacement for
the Falkland Islands Patrol role will be through a leasing
arrangement with VT; its expected ISD is 2007.


B2.15 **Support to warships, submarines and Royal Fleet Auxiliaries, including**
their update and upgrade, represents a signifi cant element of a platform’s wholelife cost; for example, for CVF the initial procurement will account for around
hi d f l h hlif I h l f


**_Fi_** **_B2(ii)_**


-----

B2.18 Not all key capabilities must be exercised onshore for every
project. The strategic need for onshore execution will be judged on
a case by case basis (Figure B2(ii) illustrates this point); with the
proviso that off shore delivery should not challenge the viability of key
capabilities in the Maritime Sector as a whole. Using this model we can
distinguish between that which must be executed onshore; and that
which may be competed more widely, but might need to be executed
onshore for reasons of sustainability or commercial viability.


**Strategic capabilities for retention onshore:**

**Maritime systems engineering resourse: it is a high**
priority for the UK to retain the suite of capabilities required
to design complex ships and submarines, from concept to
point of build; and the complementary skills to manage
the build, integration, assurance, test, acceptance, support
and upgrade of maritime platforms through life.

**Shipbuilding and integration: there is no absolute**
requirement to build all warships and Royal Fleet Auxiliary
vessels onshore, but a minimum ability to build and
integrate complex ships in the UK must be retained.

**Submarines: for the foreseeable future the UK will retain**
all of those capabilities unique to submarines and their
Nuclear Steam Raising Plant (NSRP), to enable their design,
development, build, support, operation and decommissioning.

**Maritime Combat Systems: the ability to develop complex maritime**
combat systems is a high priority for the UK, and their integration
into warships and submarines is an essential onshore capability.

**Maritime support: the UK shall retain the ability to**
maintain and support the eff ectiveness of the Fleet, including
incremental acquisition, generating force elements at
readiness, and meeting urgent operational requirements.

**Maritime systems and technologies: it is a high priority**
to retain onshore research, development and integration
of specifi c key maritime systems and technologies.


**Shipbuilding and physical integration**

B2.21 In a change to the previously stated Defence Industrial Policy
(DIP), there is no absolute sovereign requirement to construct all our
warship hulls onshore. We have revised our approach which concentrated
solely on hull construction, now to consider sovereignty of the highvalue capabilities needed for our operational independence.

B2.22 We need to build onshore to the extent that it sustains the ability
to design and physically integrate complex warships. Furthermore, since
warships are rarely prototyped, we need to ensure that we retain the
ability to learn and adjust designs whilst the fi rst of class is being built.
Steel may be cut when the design is relatively incomplete compared to
other military platforms; feedback during the production process is critical
to ensuring that the platform meets the requirement as intended.

**_T_** **_45D t_**


**Through-life capability management. A good example of this**
in practise is the refi t of HMS ILLUSTRIOUS to prepare it for a new
dedicated strike carrier role. It is also a good example of how the UK
shipbuilding industry can rise to such challenges. HMS ILLUSTRIOUS
was a 30 month, £120M refi t, to deliver an extensive upgrade
package within an ambitious timescale. It came in under budget,
enabling the savings to be re-invested in additional upgrades to
the ship during the refi t. Central to this success was a triangular
partnership between the contractors, the MOD and the ship’s
company. The NAO cites this as a good practice example in its recent
report - Driving the Successful Delivery of Major Defence Projects.


**Maritime systems engineering resource**

B2.19 The systems engineering resource includes: design expertise from
early concept through to design for manufacture; all elements of maritime
project management and the ability to specify and manage complex
warship integration, test & acceptance at the platform and system-ofsystems levels. These skills are as relevant to the through-life management
of military vessels as they are to the front end procurement process.

B2.20 Maintaining control of the procurement and support processes
as an intelligent customer is essential, regardless of where they occur.
During initial procurement and throughout service, we must be able to
manage the product risk associated with complex maritime platforms,
particularly for the fi rst of a new class of vessel. We are also required
to fulfi l our duty as a safe and competent owner and operator of
our assets; and we will regularly use industry to provide supporting
advice. Therefore, retention of the Maritime Systems Engineering
Resource must encompass the expertise necessary to generate and
ili bili h h h i i i lif l


-----

B2.23 The build of warships extends beyond the simplistic view of
steelwork and its assembly, incorporating an amalgamation of skills,
facilities, technologies and knowledge. In particular, it is the high complexity,
value added aspects of ship build and platform integration that must be
maintained under UK sovereignty: this includes specialist hull construction
involving signature amelioration, Nuclear Biological Chemical Damage
Control requirements, and complex fabrication and assembly technologies.
These capabilities can be maintained in the long term only by their
continued employment in suitably representative programmes of work.

B2.24 There is no requirement for fabrication of basic structures in the UK
per se; however, mounting military operations from the UK base (including
the fi t of specifi c equipment for the operation in question), requires the
relevant facilities and skills to be available onshore. Additionally, it is not
eff ective to develop from scratch the most advanced, high-value skills needed
for specialist hull construction or complex assembly tasks. There must be
suffi cient fabrication onshore to sustain a skills development path for workers
to learn their trade and progress towards the most challenging tasks.


**Submarines**

B2.26 The UK’s fl eet of nuclear powered submarines requires a specialist
subset of skills within the maritime industry. We have duties of nuclear
ownership and commitments to the USA which can only be fulfi lled by close
control of an onshore submarine business. Therefore, it is essential that the UK
retains the capability safely to deliver, operate and maintain these platforms,
without signifi cant reliance on unpredictable off shore expertise. This
delivery spans from conceptual design through to disposal, and includes the
management of submarine and nuclear safety; all underpinned by appropriate
science and technology. Some submarine sub-system elements may be sourced
from abroad, but only under appropriate arrangements that guarantee supply,
or from a suffi ciently broad supplier base to assure access and availability.


B2.27 Deep scientifi c and technical advice on hydrodynamics,
manoeuvring & control, propulsor technology and atmosphere
control are specifi c capabilities essential to submarine performance.
Structural acoustic engineering design is not readily available from
the broader marketplace and has to be maintained within the
specialist submarine industry. Submarine hull and infrastructure
design and construction require the use of specialist techniques, for
example particular welding and fabrication processes. These specialist
underpinning key capabilities must be sustained in the UK.

B2.28 The ability to manage Nuclear Steam Raising Plant throughout
its life-cycle, including the fuel elements, is a strategic capability that
must be retained onshore. This includes design and development,
manufacture, test and evaluation and decommissioning. An irreducible
minimum level of associated facilities, intellectual resource and
supporting technologies must be provided within the UK or under
arrangements that guarantee UK control and safe ownership.


B2.25 When determining where aspects of a programme should
be executed, straightforward cost considerations cannot be taken
in isolation. We must also consider the strategic requirement for an
industrial programme, suffi cient in volume and complexity to deliver
higher-end capabilities. Programmes that will tend towards total
onshore delivery are those where the complexity (typically ‘packing
density’ or outfi t to steel work ratio) is high: the management and
overhead of an off shore fabrication eff ort becomes less attractive when
the high value aspects of a programme signifi cantly outweigh the
low order fabrication costs. This is especially true when a high level
of outfi tting is conducted at the same time as block construction.

###### The ratio of Combat System to platform costs is typically 2:1 for complex vessels; for Type 45 it is in the region of 60% for the Combat System against 20% hull costs.

**_Fi_** **_B2(iii)_**


B2.29 A Combat System is a sophisticated and complex system,
ongoing development is essential if interoperability and military
advantage are to be maintained. Combat System engineering
consists of two complementary endeavours: the logical development
of sub-systems into a single Combat System; and the physical
integration of the Combat System into the platform, to deliver the
platform’s military capability. These two aspects of Combat System
engineering apply equally for both surface ships and submarines.

B2.30 Not all elements of a Combat System must be developed and
provisioned onshore; but it is strategically important to be capable of
developing a single integrated Combat System. Maintaining control of

procurement and through-life management of the Combat System,
including spiral development and incremental acquisition. This dictates
absolute involvement at the front edge of procurement and an ongoing
relationship with a sovereign Combat System Design Authority.

###### The Type 42 Class of Destroyers has undergone a major architectural redesign and fi ve further capability upgrades in the last 12 years.

B2.31 Physical integration of a Combat System into a maritime
platform requires co-operation between the systems engineering
organisation that maintains the design architecture of the platform and
the Combat System design authority; given the likelihood of ongoing
change through-life, this needs to be an enduring relationship. This
high value-added aspect of shipbuilding must be retained within
the UK maritime industrial base, if through-life development is to
be pursued for complex or strategically important platforms.

**Maritime support**

B2.32 Support of the UK Fleet has traditionally been divided between
Operational Support and Refi tting, each with very diff erent requirements
and characteristics. However, the division is becoming increasingly blurred
by an approach to routine upgrade known as ‘Fleet Time Fitting’, which
is undertaken during periods in harbour for vessels at higher states of
readiness. Onshore ability to conduct both Operational Support and Refi t is
strategically essential, but largely for diff erent reasons and at diff ering scales.

B2.33 The need for Operational Support is equally applicable to warships,
submarines and RFAs. Implicit in Operational Support is the ability to mount
operations from the UK base through rapid force generation; it involves
bringing units to increased levels of readiness, including the installation of
mission specifi c equipment, and the provision and integration of equipment
to meet urgent operational requirements. These tasks frequently require
a high speed cycle through the acquisition process, and involve classifi ed
military capabilities and the handling of highly sensitive material. Therefore,
key discriminators for provision of Operational Support include maintenance
of national security and assured access to meet operational planning
assumptions. Conduct of system upgrades by ‘Fleet Time Fitting’ increases the
overall operational availability of the Fleet, but introduces similar demands to
those of rapid force generation, albeit in slightly less demanding timescales.

###### In preparation for Operation TELIC, more than 30 warships, submarines and RFAs were fi tted with over 120 operational enhancements in less than one month.

B2.34 The infrastructure required to conduct refi ts is extensive and
not readily regenerated once lost. A level of surface ship refi t capability
must be retained in the UK to ensure guaranteed access when required,
including for urgent operational support. An onshore refi t capability
b i l h i d f di f i i


a signifi cant issue, or control of the programme is strategically necessary.
Contingent docking and recovery from operations will require a UK
dockyard, especially as embarked ammunition is often involved. For the
less complex platforms, refi ts may be conducted off shore (e.g. RFAs and
some minor war vessels) once sensitive equipment has been removed
or security concerns, including force protection, otherwise safeguarded.
The requirement to refi t the submarine fl otilla onshore is absolute.

**_T23 Frigate._**

**Maritime systems and technologies**

B2.35 Running through each of the strategic themes is the need
to sustain suffi cient research and technology investigation to develop
and maintain maritime domain expertise. This supports the UK in
remaining an intelligent customer, even when buying elements
from off shore, and is particularly pertinent to matching capability
to threat. In the past, we have held suffi cient research capability inhouse, but it is increasingly developed and sustained by industry.

###### UK Mine Countermeasures and Uninhabited Underwater Vehicles expertise enabled evaluation and adaptation of a US commercial reconnaissance vehicle, which is now in service with the RN.

B2.36 The UK has a strategic advantage in many key platform and Combat
System technologies and systems. These military capabilities are often in
sensitive areas and have high security classifi cations. For the purposes of
operational and strategic security, or assured access at times of tension
or confl ict, onshore retention of key research and development is a high
priority. Onshore expertise also enables the exploitation of wider research
to deliver systems that meet UK capability requirements. Retention of these

###### Overview of the current maritime Global and UK Market

**Global overview**


B2.37 Worldwide commercial shipbuilding is mainly in Asia (Korea,
Japan and China), which has around 70% of world production. With
about 20% of world ship production, Europe is competitive for the more
complex platforms such as passenger carriers and specialist vessels.

B2.38 Global military shipbuilding is dominated by the USA and Europe. In
the US, ownership has consolidated into two main shipbuilding companies and
two companies providing major sub-systems. Europe has twelve major military
shipbuilding companies, with the bulk of these in UK, France, Germany, Spain,
Italy, and the Netherlands: having consolidated from a larger industrial base
further rationalisation seems likely. Similarly, there are extensive military ship
repair facilities throughout Europe and within the US, many still controlled
by national governments; consolidation and rationalisation is also evident in
this area. To date, rationalisation has not extended across borders, although
some cooperative programmes have been pursued by European governments.
Retaining national military support facilities is widely seen as an essential
requirement for mounting and supporting operations of a fi rst class Navy.


B2.41 The maritime support workload has also reduced in recent
years, both as a result of force level reductions and new rationalized
maintenance techniques. Whilst some increase in demand for updates
and upgrades will moderate this trend, the UK exhibits over-capacity
in support facilities. Existing suppliers have not been incentivised to
rationalise, as keenly competitive bidding has driven down prices,
limiting funds available for the short-term investment required. The
repair yards have therefore experienced fl uctuating work loads.

B2.42 Ownership of UK warship yards has consolidated to two
main companies with the skills necessary to design, manufacture
and integrate complex warships: BAE Systems (Naval Ships and
Submarines) and VT Shipbuilding; with further capacity at Swan
Hunter. DML and Babcock Engineering Services have design capability
and fabrication skills but, together with FSL, essentially deliver
surface ship and submarine support (including upkeep).


B2.43 Areas of critical expertise such as design and systems integration
skills exist throughout the industrial base, not simply within the
manufacturing sector. For example, BMT, QinetiQ and Three Quays have
expertise in naval design and systems engineering; QinetiQ having the
additional capacity to undertake research. Other large companies without
shipyard infrastructure contribute signifi cant capabilities. For example,
Rolls-Royce Marine design and manufacture submarine nuclear propulsion
and marine gas turbines; Thales Naval is a leading Combat System design,
engineering and integration company, whilst supplying specifi c systems
such as sonar; Ultra is profi cient in underwater systems and naval Command
and Control. More than half the unit cost of a naval vessel lies with fi rms
other than the shipbuilder, and we recognise the importance of small and
medium enterprises as part of this mix, whether within the supply chain of
primes or those that work directly with the MOD. Many of the higher order
capabilities are dependent on the specialist skills and expertise of SMEs.
SMEs’ ability to meet our requirements is an important consideration.

**Application of commercial capacity to defence**


**The UK sector**

B2.39 The contraction of the UK shipbuilding industry has been
driven by fierce competition for commercial shipbuilding work,
primarily from within Europe and the Far East. The UK industry
is no longer sufficiently competitive to win substantial amounts
of traditional merchant shipbuilding, especially where extensive
conventional steelwork is involved. However, the industry
remains internationally competitive on high-value conversion
and refit work, and on specialist builds such as luxury yachts.


###### B2


B2.40 A reduction in UK warship building has mirrored the parallel
reduction in the number of platforms required by the Royal Navy.
Nevertheless, the UK remains a major provider of warships, ranked
in the world’s top four alongside USA, Germany and France. MOD
is the UK shipbuilding industry’s biggest customer, and naval ships
comprise around 85% of those being constructed in UK shipyards.
We will spend several billion pounds in the next decade to procure
new ships and submarines. The potential for exports to help sustain
the UK industrial capability should not be underestimated. The
RN is a valuable asset to industry in promoting export business.
However, UK new builds for export are a small fraction of the
domestic output, whereas European states export a significant
proportion of their total build. This reflects the global demand
for modestly priced frigates, rather than the high-end complexity
currently represented by the majority of UK shipbuilders’ portfolios.

###### France and Germany together have more than 60% of the military export market; Germany producing twice as much for export as for domestic use.[1]


B2.44 There are clear diff erences between warship and commercial
shipbuilding: the cost of a warship is typically 70% systems, 30% hull
construction and outfi tting; by contrast, for a commercial ship the fi gures
are typically 20% systems, 80% hull construction. The underlying skill
sets and processes for warship work are not available in yards focussed on
the commercial sector. In general terms, the more war-like the vessel, the
more complex the ship: this does not necessarily apply to hull fabrication,
but does apply to many aspects of design, outfi tting, military system
integration, test and commissioning. Naval shipbuilding is specialist work
and demands signifi cant assurance regimes, engineering and professional
support, whose underlying skills take time to build and eff ort to sustain.

B2.45 The diff erences between military and commercial shipbuilding
need not necessarily exclude commercial shipyards from military
shipbuilding. Their expertise potentially is relevant to less complex
auxiliary and support vessels, where commercial design and production
techniques off er considerable effi ciencies over warship construction
practices. The wider commercial sector also off ers a benchmark against
which military yards can set performance improvement targets, taking
into account the increased complexity of military shipbuilding. Nonwarship facilities also undertake a valuable supporting role in fabrication
and other work, particularly during periods of peak demand for
facilities and resources. The wider industrial base has system integration
experience, but this is not directly comparable to the complexity of
warship integration. Nevertheless, there are some useful lessons to
be learned from the Alliance/partnering approach the wider industry

**UK Military Shipbuilding Skills Base**

UK military shipbuilding requires a highly skilled
work force that can be confi dent in an enduring
and stable career path. This is particularly true
of the high value skills, knowledge and expertise
demanded for the delivery of complex warships.

The ratio of white to blue-collar workers in commercial
yards is 1:6, in military yards it is about 1:1·7.

In some areas, industry is confi dent of its ability to
generate capability rapidly should the need arise,
steelwork fabrication being a key example. However,
many military standards (such as for welding and surface
fl atness) are higher than for commercial work.

Research suggests that when shipyards lay-off
workers, 70% of them leave the industry and are
unavailable for re-hire by their former employer[2].

There is a perceived skills shortage in specifi c capability areas.
For example, industry agrees that design engineers are in
short supply; and the intellectual support of underpinning
science and technology is also fragile in some areas.
Demographics are likely to feature as an increasing
challenge in the sustainability of this workforce and the
delivery of the Maritime Sector’s key capabilities.

###### Sustainment strategy

**To maintain the key capabilities, a vibrant**
**onshore forward programme is required,**
**focusing on high value activities.**

B2.46 The planned maritime forward programme represents a healthy
customer order book for the industry and is likely to sustain UK employment in
the maritime sector well into the next decade. The UK Maritime Industrial Base
currently possesses the key capabilities required to support this programme.
Furthermore, the UK has the industrial capability to design, manufacture and
support all UK Fleet surface ships, submarines and auxiliaries, but may not have
the fabrication capacity to absorb the full programme at its peak. However,
the high volume of programmed shipbuilding activity cannot be sustained
indefi nitely. Beyond the peak of activity for CVF the potential work available
to UK industry reduces to a steadier state by around 2016. The future for UK
shipbuilders lies in high value design, systems and sub-system assembly and
integration; plus specialist and novel hull construction capability, particularly
where there is a high outfi t to steel ratio, as exhibited in complex warships.

_b ildi_ _i h UK’ F_ _E_ _i_ _L d J l 2003_


**The UK’s Maritime Industrial Base must**
**deliver improvements in its performance.**

B2.47 To deliver an aff ordable forward programme the maritime sector faces
considerable challenges, including industry’s ability to control costs. The UK
maritime business is characterised by high and increasing overheads, and has a
skills base spread across too many entities. Procurement strategies and commercial
arrangements have not adequately incentivised or enabled rationalisation and
effi ciency improvements. The sector has failed consistently to deliver satisfactory
performance, with several high-profi le maritime projects encountering delays
and cost increases. The business must be streamlined for greater effi ciency and
profi tability, whilst mirroring UK demand and maximizing the opportunity for
export. The UK will need to buy warships and submarines for the foreseeable
future, but the clear trend is for fewer, more capable platforms, with longer
operational lives and increased opportunity for regular upgrades in response to new
technologies and threats. The ability to do so will depend upon us working together
with industry to address the fundamental issues of aff ordability and productivity.

**Challenges for UK Shipbuilding**

Independent study has shown:

Major UK Defence Acquisitions are typically behind schedule.
Commercial ships are typically produced on time.
Ship builders employ no consistent forecasting methodology.
We must work with industry to better manage late changes.
Late delivery of commercial ships attracts more punitive
fi nancial penalties than for military vessels.

The commercial and military markets diff er signifi cantly
in ship size & complexity, acquisition process, design and
construction, and the work force skill sets and make-up.
Industry restructuring and changed industry/
MOD processes could benefi t the UK military
programme and increase export opportunities.

**_Source: ‘Monitoring the progress of_**
**_shipbuilding programmes’. RAND 2005_**

**Without improvements in performance, delivery**
**of the forward equipment programme is**
**threatened. Industry restructuring is a priority.**

B2.48 The current situation is unsustainable and places huge
pressure on the future programme. Whilst applicable to surface
ships it is compounded many times over in the submarine domain,
due to the high cost of entry for these specialist capabilities and
the very high overheads for their continued delivery. Industry
restructuring and consolidation is likely to be a key feature of any
improvement programme, and fundamental to creating a viable and
sustainable business to meet anticipated steady-state demand.

B2.49 In addition to horizontal consolidation the potential for
integration of procurement and support delivery must be realised
if effi ciencies are to be generated. This off ers the prospect of better
management of through-life military capability, from delivery to
disposal. It would also entail rationalisation of facilities and the
skill base, delivering a more enduring and stable career path.

B2.50 In light of the serious fi nancial challenges facing the industry, it
is our view that consolidation should occur as a matter of urgency. This is
i l l i h S b i d i b li h b d


-----

**The nature of restructuring is for industry to**
**consider, but must be customer focused**

B2.51 We will not micromanage industry’s restructuring but it must
be customer focused and we are likely to express preferences as diff erent
approaches emerge. We must be confi dent that consolidation will be
benefi cial to MOD and industry. We are considering potential models as
they arise and these might involve some form of Government stake in how
the industry develops. We also recognise that as the predominant client we
are critical to improving the effi ciency of the supply demand relationship.


**There will be a minimum level of activity, or Core**
**Work Load, necessary to sustain the key capabilities.**

B2.53 We recognise that simply maintaining a minimum sovereign
industrial base is not likely to be attractive to industry or to represent
good value for money. To make the industry viable will require a throughlife capability approach based on cost of ownership. Working with
industry we will defi ne a Core Work Load that not only would sustain
the key capabilities, but also off er value for money and be commercially
viable, allowing industry to scale its core capacity accordingly.


**We will pursue procurement strategies**
**and commercial arrangements that are**
**optimised for the sector to deliver three key**
**objectives: a sustainable enterprise, better**
**performance for MOD, and opportunities for**
**attractive rates of return for industry.**

B2.52 We will seek to employ more sophisticated strategies and
arrangements that will be optimised for the sector. Competition will
continue to be used when appropriate, especially for embedded electronics
and marine equipment, but alternative approaches will be developed
where they are necessary to deliver greater value for money and long
term sustainability. As an example of an optimised approach the Future
Carrier (CVF) project is being pursued through the CVF Alliance. This
type of arrangement is well established in the oil and gas industries,
but innovative for UK defence acquisition. It draws on the strengths,
resources and expertise of all parties with rewards geared to the overall
project outcome rather than maximising benefi ts to one participant.


B2.55 We will seek to sustain this workload to ensure the retention of
key capabilities and the viability of the business that delivers them. This
will be achieved by viewing the forward programme as a set of projects
that may be phased to balance required military capability, aff ordability
and industrial sustainability. Clearly, fl exibility will continue to be required
as circumstances can change; but given the importance of sustaining a
critical mass of onshore expertise, for both maintaining sovereignty and
delivering value for money, sustainability impacts will be given serious
attention when adjustments to the programme are being considered.

B2.56 The concept of project frequency, or ‘drumbeat’, is a response to this
theme. For submarines we have endorsed, but not yet committed funding for
a 24 month SSN build drumbeat. This scales the build capacity to be satisfi ed
by the industry supply chain after the third Astute Class submarine (HMS
ARTFUL); and sets the rhythm for the rest of the programme, notably support.
The longer term surface ship production drumbeat is of the order of one new
platform every one to two years, given anticipated force levels and platform
life cycles. The concept of drumbeat is not restricted to major platform delivery,
but includes discrete key capabilities, such as Combat System development.


B2.54 The Core Work Load will contain all activity unique to submarines.
For surface ships it is possible that only a proportion of the total programme
in any given period may be required to sustain key capabilities. This core
is likely to be centred on, though not necessarily restricted to, an onshore
build capability for large complex warships. This activity will provide
the necessary experience for the management of build, integration and
testing across the wider maritime programme. The Core Work Load will
include support activities required to prepare and deploy UK forces.

**We will provide industry with visibility of a**
**sustained demand to deliver this Core Work Load.**


###### B2


B2.57 The Support work-rate is set by the size of the Fleet and the
maintenance cycle, which is dominated by overhaul periods, and defueling for
submarines. The new vessels (Astute Class, Type 45) will require less maintenance
than legacy platforms. This combines with the reduced size of the Fleet to
result in a lower and fl uctuating maintenance demand. To counter this we are
assessing alternative maintenance cycles with more frequent, less intrusive
interventions, which will both smooth demand and improve readiness.

**We will not pay a premium for capacity in excess**
**of that required to deliver the Core Work Load.**


**_T_** **_23HMSSUTHERLAND_**


B2.58 Projects within the maritime programme that exceed the
Core Work Load requirement may be widely competed and potentially
undertaken off shore if it does not prejudice the key capabilities. UK
industry will be able to bid for this, capacity allowing. However, we
will not expect industrial capacity over that required to meet the Core
Work Load to have an adverse impact on the MOD’s overall exposure
to industry’s overheads. When considering work outside the Core Work
Load envelope, we will not make a simplistic distinction between entire
l f h li ll di j l


-----

B2.59 The CVF and Type 45 programmes represent a signifi cant deviation
from normal steady-state demand. It would be unwise to expand onshore
capacity above current levels, only for it to contract rapidly after CVF delivery.
Low complexity elements of CVF build are strong candidates for off shore
provision, if UK steady-state capacity is exceeded and better value for money
is off ered elsewhere. After the Type 45 and CVF surge we will seek to ensure a
managed transition to a more typical, less intensive build/integration activity.
This will involve smoothing the work rate to sustain the Core Work Load.

**_Type 45 (Computer Generated Image)._**

**We recognise the fragility of the design base**
**and we will implement measures to exercise the**
**capability when this is strategically necessary and**
**can be shown to off er long-term value for money.**

B2.60 Major design is a relatively infrequent activity naturally occurring
just once per class. However, maintaining the platform design is a throughlife activity, with updates and upgrades requiring signifi cant design eff ort
up until a platform’s last refi t (often with further application on disposal).
By combining the new build and support design activities in a rationalised
manner, a more sustainable capability is possible. This also off ers the
potential for whole-life cost reduction and capability enhancements,
as well as long-term career paths for the associated engineers.

B2.61 CVF detailed design work will employ much of the nation’s maritime
engineering workforce to the end of the decade. However, early concept and
architectural design requires a subset of this skilled workforce, which will need
managed short term sustainment as their employment by CVF diminishes.

B2.62 Submarine design capability is at risk if long gaps emerge between
fi rst-of-class design eff orts. The eleven year break between the design of
Vanguard and Astute undoubtedly led to a loss of capability and impacted on
the Astute programme. We now aspire to an eight year drumbeat to sustain the
design capability through incremental improvements, both to drive down build
costs and reduce subsequent support costs. In the short term key design eff ort
will be focussed on improving these whole-life costs in the existing Astute
design, particularly in areas that have direct benefi t to subsequent classes.

B2.63 The submarine design programme will ensure options for
a successor to the current Vanguard class deterrent are kept open in
advance of eventual decisions, likely to be necessary in this Parliament.
Cost-eff ectiveness will clearly be a key factor in any consideration of
potential options, both submarine based and non-submarine based.
For submarine-based options it will be very important that MOD and
industry are able to demonstrate an ability to drive down and control
the costs of nuclear submarine programmes. Industry will be fully
engaged in ensuring that design eff orts achieve the maximum impact
in control of submarine build and support costs, so sustaining the
i l f hi i ifi f b i d ili bili


**Combat Systems sustainability and ongoing**
**development will be promoted by the use of**
**modern design and integration techniques, whilst**
**facilitating integration of products from both large**
**scale traditional suppliers and smaller enterprises.**

B2.64 Combat System design and integration capabilities are a clear
strategic imperative to deliver the required installed performance in
maritime combatants. The adoption of planned and future upgrades
will help to maintain the necessary suite of capabilities. In parallel,
submarine and warship initiatives to converge towards a reduced set of
core Combat System solutions will support the incremental approach.
These common core Combat Systems will seek to exploit Modular Open
System Architecture design philosophies, to enable continuous obsolescence
management and aff ordable capability insertion across the Fleet.

**_Type 23 Frigate’s Operations Room._**

B2.65 The Surface Ship Combat Management System Convergence
and submarine Common Core Combat System initiatives are both
seeking to promote these strategies in the medium term. These
initiatives have the potential to consolidate and retain the strategic
capabilities necessary to form Combat System Architecture Authorities
and support the specialist capabilities necessary to integrate modern
high-technology sub-systems. A key objective is to exploit Open
Architectures to allow SMEs, many from within UK industry and
academia, to contribute niche capabilities in areas such as sensor
algorithms, data fusion, security, and knowledge based systems.

B2.66 In the longer term we will investigate innovative
methods of sustaining the UK’s Combat System design,
integration and acceptance expertise and associated facilities.
We will welcome novel proposals from industry.

**We will take specifi c measures to ensure**
**sustainability of signifi cant capabilities in 2nd**
**and 3rd tier suppliers where these are at risk.**

B2.67 We need further work to better understand the risks to
2nd and 3rd tier suppliers. Certain key capabilities have very limited
sources of supply, which become fragile if they are not loaded or
managed appropriately. Several levers exist to reduce exposure to
this risk, ranging from increasing volume by amalgamating orders, to
removing the critical component by redesign. We will work with primes
to prevent the loss of key capabilities through failure of the supply
chain. We are already moving in this direction with recent examples
including procurement action to sustain the Astute Boat supply chain,
d l f h NSRP l h i


-----

B2.68 Frequently a signifi cant proportion of the escalation in project
costs occurs through bought-in equipment. It is imperative for the
MOD and industry 1st tier suppliers to ensure that they manage
exposure to cost escalations throughout the supply chain.

**We will seek to work together with industry to**
**develop and sustain our own capabilities.**


B2.69 It is essential that we sustain the qualities necessary for
the MOD to fulfi l its obligations as a safe and competent owner
and operator of its vessels. In some specialist areas our capability is
fragile. Action is now in hand to redevelop these areas and to actively
career manage associated disciplines. We anticipate this will include
working with industry, using secondment and joint working to develop
knowledge for the benefi t of both the MOD and the private sector.

B2.70 A range of measures are being applied to improve our performance and
coherence. For instance, Director General (Nuclear), based in the DLO, has been
appointed as the single focal point for delivery of nuclear submarine programmes
across the MOD. We are committed to change that enables industry to perform
eff ectively and address overall long-term sustainability. In particular, we are
developing a stream of work known as the Maritime Industrial Strategy (MIS).


industrial arrangements being put together on the CVF programme to drive
restructuring to meet both the CVF peak and the reduced post-CVF demand.
For surface ship support, we will start immediate negotiations with industry
with the aim of exploring alternative contracting arrangements and the
way head for the next upkeep periods, which start in the autumn of 2006.
Key maritime equipment industrial capabilities will be supported by the
production of a sustainability strategy for these equipments by June 2006.

**The high work load in the immediate Maritime**
**Equipment Programme opens a window of**
**opportunity for industry to do things diff erently.**


**MIS will be at the heart of developing a sustainable**
**relationship between the MOD and industry.**

B2.71 We have been working with industry on the MIS for some time,
looking at how we can best tackle these diffi cult sustainability issues. This
work is concentrating on more clearly identifying the likely volume and timing
of future business, and defi ning in greater detail how we plan to maintain
the sovereign capabilities we require. This includes defi ning the Core Work
Load in discussion with industry. In parallel, we expect industry to begin
restructuring itself around the emerging Core Work Load. The success of the
MIS is ultimately dependent on companies’ willingness to work together and
draw their own conclusions. However, we need improvements in quality and
effi ciency if our programme is to be aff ordable. The MIS needs to defi ne the
routemap to delivering this whilst sustaining our sovereign capabilities.


B2.75 The increased demand of the next few years will diminish after the
middle of the next decade. Although over-capacity off ers the theoretical
prospect of competition, this is unlikely to be sustainable in a shrinking
market. Value for money may soon be delivered better through alternative
strategies. For example, one fully loaded allocated stream of surface ship
build might off er better value for money than several partially loaded
streams in competition. We have been working to smooth out the long term
cyclical demand for naval warships and provide a more predictable future
for ourselves, and industry. But this more stable future can only be achieved
if the design, manufacturing, support and integration capacity within
the industry is matched to that pattern of demand. There is a clear need
to streamline the businesses, making them more effi cient and profi table,
removing duplication and establishing clear centres of excellence, to meet our
requirements and maximise the military export potential. This is good for the
Royal Navy, the taxpayer and for the long term sustainability of the industry.

B2.76 Our shipbuilding industry needs to renew itself and there
is a window of opportunity to do so, now. By taking this opportunity
head on and tackling the challenges it presents, there can be a
fundamental shift from seeking profi t through volume, to profi t
derived from excellent delivery, long-term support, and the continual
improvement of the military capability available to the front line.


###### B2


B2.72 MIS now embraces the Submarine Acquisition Modernisation (SAM)
and Surface Ship Support (SSS) projects. These initiatives were launched
to address growing concern at the performance of elements of the sector.
By combining these projects, examining both procurement and long-term
support improvements, we recognize that a viable and sustainable Maritime
Sector is dependent on a more coherent approach across both domains.

**We will move ahead quickly to begin making**
**the most of immediate opportunities.**


B2.73 Under the MIS, we will immediately start negotiations with the
key companies that make up the submarine supply chain to achieve a
programme level partnering agreement with a single industrial entity for
the full life cycle of the submarine fl otilla, while addressing key aff ordability
issues. The objective is to achieve this agreement in time for the award
of the contract for the fourth and subsequent Astute class submarines
in early 2007. This will be matched by the implementation of a unifi ed
submarine programme management organisation within the MOD.

B2.74 For surface ship design and build, we aim within the next six months
to arrive at a common understanding of the Core Work Load required to sustain
the high-end design, systems engineering and combat systems integration
skills that we have identifi ed as being important. We expect industry to
begin restructuring itself around the emerging analysis as set out above to

###### Armoured Fighting Vehicles
### B3


###### Defi nition

B3.1 Armoured fi ghting vehicles (AFVs) are bespoke land military
vehicles optimised for close combat operations which possess appropriate
levels of survivability, lethality and mobility to enable operations
in a high threat environment. They perform in general utility as
well as specialised roles and can be either wheeled or tracked.

###### Strategic overview

B3.2 The Defence White Paper of December 2003 stated that the UK
requires a clear focus on projecting force, further afi eld and even more
quickly than has previously been the case. This places an emphasis on
speed of deployment, fl exibility, and the agility required to deploy rapidly
for a diverse range of expeditionary operations. We should maintain a
credible warfi ghting capability to undertake demanding combat in all
appropriate Military Tasks and at varying scales of eff ort. In sum, our
combat power must be credible enough to coerce and deter eff ectively
and, when called upon, allow us to disrupt and defeat an opponent.

B3.3 The Army is being restructured in accordance with the Future
Army Structure (FAS) programme to provide a fl exible and balanced
land force structure consisting of a mix of heavy, medium and light
capabilities. A key element is the medium force which, when grouped
with joint assets, is termed the Medium Weight Capability. It will
provide a responsive medium scale intervention force characterised
by a high level of deployability (including elements by air), and
greater levels of mobility, fi repower and protection than are currently
possessed by light forces. The Future Rapid Eff ect System (FRES) lies
at the heart of this capability, but FRES is also required to replace
obsolescent AFVs (e.g. Saxon, FV430 and Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance

(Tracked) (CVR(T)) that are increasingly costly to run and have declining
relative capability which exposes our forces to operational risk.

B3.4 AFVs will therefore continue to lie at the heart of the Army’s
military capability for the foreseeable future as they enable operations
across the spectrum of operations, from stabilisation to warfi ghting. The
Army’s two Armoured and three Mechanised brigades are the predominant
users, along with 3 Royal Marines Commando Brigade with its Viking and
Hippo vehicles. The current vehicle numbers are summarised below:

|Fleet|Number|
|---|---|
|Challenger 2 (CR2)|385|
|CR2 Driver Training Tank|22|
|Challenger Armoured Repair and Recovery Vehicle (CRARRV)|81|

###### Equipment programmes

B3.5 **Saxon entered service in 1984 and is currently planned to reach its**
out of service date (OSD) in 2014. Other than Urgent Operational Requirements
(UORs) to vehicles deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, Saxon is not currently
expected to undergo either a life extension or an upgrade programme.


###### B3


B3.6 **Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) (CVR(T)) entered**
service (ISD) in 1972, and has had, and continues to have, an extensive
series of life extension programmes (LEPs) and upgrades since the late
1990s covering conversion to diesel engines; equipping Scimitar variants
with thermal imagers and navigation and target location systems; the
ongoing Bowman communication conversion; and the fi tting of Platform
Battlefi eld Information System Application (P-BISA). The Swingfi re anti-tank
guided weapon, fi tted to the Striker variant, is planned to reach its OSD in
2008. Thereafter, the Formation Recce overwatch capability will be met
by the dismounted Javelin anti-tank guided weapon capability operating
out of the Spartan variants until FRES enters service. The current OSD for
CVR(T) is assumed to be 2014, although this is subject to ongoing review.

B3.7 The utility vehicle FV430 entered service in 1965 and has had successive
extensions to its OSD. It is increasingly diffi cult to support. In 2006 the Defence
Logistics Organisation (DLO) will start to convert the powertrain for 500 vehicles
in order to extend their life to the current OSD of 2015; this may be reviewed
further and as such the MOD may need to convert a further tranche of vehicles.


B3.10 **The Engineer Tank System programme will enter service**
in December next year and is currently in its manufacture phase. It
consists of TITAN (an armoured bridge layer) and TROJAN (an obstacle
breacher); these will replace the current Chieftain-based Armoured
Vehicle Launched Bridge and Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers. These
vehicles provide the mobility, counter-mobility and survivability support
to armoured and mechanised battlegroups. BAE Systems Land Systems
is contracted to deliver 33 of each type plus training and support.

**_Titan._**


B3.8 The Warrior family entered service in 1987 and has been successful
on a wide variety of operations since entering service. To ensure it remains
capable to its OSD it requires a Capability Sustainment Programme (CSP)
which is now in its initial planning stages. On current plans it will improve
Warrior IFVs’ lethality, protection, ergonomics and availability probably
through a new turret, cannon and Health and Usage Monitoring System
(HUMS), as well as providing linkages to the Future Integrated Soldier
Technology (FIST) project. The CSP will include the current Armoured
**Battlefi eld Support Vehicle (ABSV), also in its concept phase. We**
plan ABSV to modify the remaining Warrior IFVs not required under FAS to
provide an armoured support vehicle for armoured infantry and engineer
units. Warrior’s OSD has recently been extended to the early 2030s.

B3.11 **PANTHER is in its Demonstration Phase and is assumed to enter**
service in the second half of 2007. PANTHER provides Command and
Liaison Vehicles to replace some CVR(T) (Spartan and Sultan), FV430,
Saxon and Land Rover Truck Utility Medium for a variety of combat,
combat support, combat service support and command support units.


B3.9 **Challenger 2 (CR2) entered service in 1998 and has had a**
successful operational life to date. Currently, CR2 is being converted
to Bowman and P-BISA. CR2 is not expected to leave service until
the mid 2030s. We will therefore need to consider the requirement
to conduct a CSP in around ten to fi fteen years time to maintain its

B3.12 **TERRIER, currently in its demonstration phase, is due to enter**
service in December 2008 and will replace the Combat Engineer Tractor. A
high utility combat engineer vehicle, there is potential to develop TERRIER
into a wider family of engineer vehicles. BAE Systems Land Systems is
contracted to deliver 65 vehicles and initial contractor logistic support.

B3.13 **Future Rapid Eff ect System (FRES) is the Army’s highest priority**
programme and will be the central pillar of a capable, coherent and highly
deployable medium force. It plans to deliver a family of network-enabled
medium weight armoured vehicles covering a wide range of combat,
combat support and combat service support roles. It has an ISD planning
assumption for initial variants in the early years of the next decade, with
further tranches of vehicles providing incremental enhancements to capability
thereafter. Production is currently expected to continue into the late 2020s
in order to deliver the large number of vehicles required by the Field Army.

B3.14 The programme is currently in its initial Assessment Phase (iAP),
in which the MOD is being supported by an independent Systems House,
Atkins. The broad aims of the iAP are: to further defi ne the capability
required; develop aff ordable options to meet the requirement; develop
optimum procurement and support strategies and to manage technology and
supplier risk to acceptable levels. A number of competitively let Technology
Demonstrator Programmes (TDPs) are also being run in order to de-risk some
of the emerging technology that is likely to be used on the platform. Central
to this are eff orts to defi ne and construct the electronic architecture, with open
standards where appropriate, that will allow FRES to take its envisaged central
role within the NEC. FRES will have a pre-planned product improvement
strategy to grow the capability over time, as well as a strategy for maintaining
a consistent modifi cation state across the fl eet during its long production run.

###### Indicative planning assumptions

B3.15 The key dynamic from the graph below is an assumption of an
increasing Equipment Plan (EP) spend which represents the beginning of
our major investment in the FRES programme. However, there is a hiatus in
new platform development as the TERRIER, TITAN and TROJAN programmes
have all now moved into production and envisaged major upgrades to
the existing fl eet are not planned until the latter half of this decade or the
early half of the next. We currently assume a consistent long-term spend
within the STP of approximately £200M per annum. We expect to spend
approximately £140M in AFV research over the 10 year period, most of which
will be absorbed in the FRES programme, included within the EP line.

###### What is required for retention in the UK industrial base?

B3.16 The AFV fleet lies at the heart of Land Forces military
effectiveness, without which the Land Force will be incapable
of deployment or operations. Recent operations have shown
their continuing importance and the significant demand for the
capabilities they provide. The following table shows the number
of AFVs that have been deployed in recent operations:

**_Figure B3(ii)._**

B3.17 There are compelling advantages to retaining a UK industrial
AFV capability at a level which enables the UK to preserve the expertise
it requires to maintain and upgrade the capability of current and future
equipment, both in peacetime and for operational requirements. To make
this possible, we need guaranteed access to the existing AFV fl eet Design
Authority (DA), BAE Systems Land Systems. But we will not do so at any
cost. Indeed, the UK is willing to consider new AFV prime contractors
being from off shore, so that we can access innovative capabilities from
foreign sources which may not be present in the UK industrial base. This
may also include aspects of the DA role, although given that our priority
is to be able to upgrade, meet UORs and support existing fl eets on-shore
it will be necessary for the DA for new AFVs to establish or maintain
some form of substantive and empowered UK presence (which could
be through an onshore partner with access to the necessary IPR). With
this in mind, the UK AFV industrial base needs to retain the following:

**AFV Systems Engineering, Domain and Design Knowledge**

     - The UK’s AFV industry needs to be capable of understanding the
military context of the UK user. Such domain knowledge should
include a developed understanding of the operational context
and the Defence Lines of Development. It also includes the
ability to understand as an intelligent customer how to design,
develop and build a new AFV and the ability to integrate the
platform into the wider suite of capabilities that make up
**the network. This knowledge also supports the skills required**
for the through-life capability management of AFVs, such
as being able to understand how to undertake modifi cations,
upgrades and complete UORs. Guaranteed access to design
knowledge of the existing AFV fl eet will also be important to
underwrite the safety, legality and performance of these AFVs;

the intellectual ability to design, validate and interpret
**the results of AFV testing should also be retained onshore, in**
order that the customer has complete assurance of the safety and
capability of AFVs. Test and evaluation facilities do not necessarily

**critical AFV sub-systems – Within AFVs are particular sub-**
systems which provide either battle-winning capability or strategic
leverage with coalition partners. It is therefore critical that the
UK industrial base retains the necessary critical mass to design,
build and integrate such sub-systems onto the platform to
ensure continued guaranteed access. These technologies include:

Integrated survivability solutions, notably
special and electric armour;

Electronic architecture, particularly mission-critical software;
High-performance sensors and
Weapon systems.


**manufacture and repair of AFVs – There is no absolute**
requirement to manufacture all of the constituent parts
of an AFV in the UK. An onshore capability to repair and
overhaul AFVs is however required, both for routine
maintenance and in response to operational needs;


the ability of industry to respond quickly at times of high
**operational tempo is of particular priority. This includes the**
design and delivery of UORs in a timely manner; the provision
of contractor support on deployed operations; to enable a surge
repair capability; and the management of a responsive supply
chain, which will include the ability to provide secure sourcing
of essential raw materials for critical sub-systems. This does
not mean that all components must be built on shore, but that
the management process to coordinate this complex process
must be on shore to guarantee operational availability.

B3.19 Lightweight AFVs (in the 7 - 15 tonnes bracket) tend to be less
sophisticated and both supply and demand are greater and more elastic, with
more industry funded product development taking place. However, the entry
into this light AFV market of new lower cost manufacturers – from Russia,
Ukraine and Turkey for example - means that competition is strong and UK
has found itself without a competitive product. We have not developed a
signifi cant lightweight AFV since CVR(T) in the early 1970s. Although this was
an outstanding export success, it is now generally viewed as obsolescent.


###### B3


###### Overview of the current defence market

**AFV world market overview**


B3.18 There is a competitive world market for AFVs. In general, companies
that produce sophisticated AFVs in the heavy (30-70 tonnes) and medium
(15-30 tonnes) categories rely on their national governments to fund the high
development cost of new products and have their national armed forces as lead
customer. The cost discourages independent speculative AFV development,
for either home or export markets.  Once developed, export opportunities
are usually limited to nations that have signifi cant investment in their armed
forces but no indigenous AFV capability, and are heavily contested.  Whilst the
UK has had some export success over the last 20 years with the Warrior IFV,
Challenger 2, CVR(T) and Saxon, the German Leopard 2 Main Battle Tank and
the Swedish CV90 Infantry Fighting Vehicle family have been more successful.


B3.20 The focus which the UK and other nations are placing on
medium weight vehicles will off er very signifi cant market prospects
over the next 10-20 years, where families of technically innovative, but
price-competitive vehicles can be modifi ed to suit national requirements.
While the UK currently has no medium weight export product of its
own, the FRES solution would clearly be a candidate for such exports.
Specialised AFVs such as TERRIER could also be successful exports.

B3.21 The world AFV market consists of several major companies supported
by their national governments as outlined. However, the demand for heavy
AFVs has fallen below potential supply which has caused recent consolidation.
Most notably BAE Systems has extended its AFV global presence from the
UK, Sweden (BAE Systems Land Systems Hägglunds) and South Africa by
purchasing of United Defense Industries (UDI), producer of the US Bradley
Infantry Fighting Vehicle. The main US provider is General Dynamics (GD),
which produces the M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank and wheeled medium
weight vehicles such as Stryker; GD also has a strong European presence. Both
GD and BAE Systems have signifi cant roles in the US Future Combat Systems
(FCS) programme. Within Europe, key players include GIAT, provider of the
French Leclerc Main Battle Tank and VBCI wheeled IFV, and Krauss-Maff ei
**Wegmann and Rheinmetall Landsystems Gmbh who together co-produce**
the German Leopard 2 Main Battle Tank. In addition, a number of other
suppliers exist in Europe and Asia. There is thus an oversupply of products and
capacity in the market, which is driving a move towards consolidation and
highlighting the need for increased productivity to drive competitiveness.


**UK AFV market overview**

B3.22 The main characteristic of the UK AFV Industry in the past 10 years
has been its rapid consolidation - from fi ve or more prime companies (GKN
Defence, Alvis, Vickers Defence Systems, RO Defence, Marconi Defence Systems
etc) to one, BAE Systems Land Systems. Drivers for this consolidation
include: low profi t margins; the signifi cant number of UK national programmes
that have not reached product maturity leading to gaps in work load; a lack of
competitive export products; a decline in the global export market following
h d f h C ldW d h i i l d f i d

priorities. However, the industrial model has not changed, resulting in a
largely transactional relationship between the Government and industry,
supported by traditional post-design service support. Much remains to be
done to develop a more modern relationship to manage the AFV capability
through life. The consolidation has also resulted in a pressing need for us to
develop a strategy with BAE Systems Land Systems in relation to the in-service
fl eet whilst still retaining access to best of market products at sub-system level.

B3.23 Analysis of the forward programme and the sharp decline in
design work in our programmes make it diffi cult to see how industry can
retain the skill base required for the key capabilities identifi ed if we were to
continue with our current approach. TITAN and TROJAN are in production,
and the TERRIER combat engineer vehicle is in development. These will
support existing levels of design capability until the end of 2006, after
which there is no assured work. Manufacture of these vehicles fi nishes
in 2010. Export potential exists for TERRIER (and to a lesser extent TITAN
and TROJAN) but this is a niche market and, on its own, is unlikely to
preserve signifi cant design and manufacture skills in the longer term.

**_Terrier._**

B3.24 The current model of support to the in-service fl eet off ers
opportunities for design and limited manufacture work, but analysis shows
that such a reactive and transactional support arrangement does not of
itself allow long term industrial planning and restructuring. Nor does the
current model sustain the skills needed to carry out technically complex, but
infrequent, capability upgrades, including short notice support to UORs.

B3.25 In particular, ABRO, a Trading Fund of the MOD provides pivotal
support to operations by implementation and support for UORs. ABRO also
provide the capability for our armoured fl eet base repair and maintenance.

B3.26 Traditionally an AFV consists of a number of major sub-systems,
for which the AFV DA defi nes performance and interface requirements,
manufactures them or buys them in, and then integrates them into
a working vehicle. In particular, these sub-systems can also enable
the integration of the AFV into the wider military network, requiring
particular expertise of the overarching electronic architecture. Thales
and Lockheed Martin are currently de-risking aspects of the required
electronic architecture for FRES through TDPs, in order to support
the role for FRES as a hub of the NEC. Furthermore, AFV combat
systems are provided by both Thales Optronics and Selex.

B3.27 The UK industrial base also has extensive experience in providing the
physical architecture for AFVs such as tank track and transmissions provided by
the William Cook group, Caterpillar and David Brown Engineering Ltd.


###### Sustainment strategy

B3.28 There are two separate but linked areas involved in the sustainment
of our AFV capability. The fi rst is improving the through-life management
of the in-service capability linked to industrial transformation, and the
second is the management of FRES. In addition, we need to understand
the linkages between these two distinct but intertwined strands.

B3.29 BAE Systems Land Systems is the DA for 95% of the vehicles in the
current fl eet. Recognising this reality, we intend to pursue initiatives to change
the relationship between us in order that the demands of current operations,
routine support and future upgrades are met more cost-eff ectively. We also
seek improved reliability and the reduced deployed footprint necessary to
enable the directed logistic approach which is central to the Future Army
Structure (FAS). As a company, BAE Systems Land Systems operates in the
UK, the US, Sweden and South Africa, but the activities of its constituent
businesses are in our view largely autonomous. We wish to encourage BAE
Systems Land Systems to become better able to move skills, information
and eff ort within the company to provide improved value for money. We
also wish to see continued evidence of a sustained willingness to respond
to our defi ned requirements for improved through-life management of our
existing armoured vehicle capability. This improved relationship will require
us to take a more coherent through-life view within the Department.

B3.30 This will require real eff ort from both us and the company. We
intend to work with BAE Systems Land Systems to develop a series of clear
and incremental steps, which, subject to a satisfactory business case and
underpinning commercial arrangements being agreed - would lead us towards
a MOD/BAE Systems Land Systems partnering and business transformation
agreement. Under this arrangement BAE Systems Land Systems would be
incentivised to act as the systems engineer for the current fl eet, contracting
for capability provision and demonstrating a willingness to exploit the widest
possible supply chain in order to benefi t from innovation and open competition.
This agreement will draw on lessons learned from our collective work under
the munitions Framework Partnering Agreement, the Armoured Vehicle and
AS90 support initiatives and, more widely, from our work to improve support
for helicopters and fast jets. Successful delivery of work on the FV430 and
potentially the Warrior and Challenger fl eets and the future relationship
with ABRO will provide opportunities to build confi dence on both sides.

B3.31 We have determined that there is no strategic need to
own ABRO, but we also recognise that ABRO provides us with a core
capability in the repair and overhaul of the armoured fl eet, which must
be retained in the UK. We judge that until strategies for the future
provision of support for the armoured fl eet have matured, any change
in ownership of ABRO represents an unacceptable level of risk.

B3.32 For the future, we require industry to deliver an increasingly complex
system of systems that will make up the FRES fl eet. This includes not only the
systems integration of complex sub-systems into the platform itself, which is
more than just a question of the physical assembly, but also the integration of
the platform into the wider military network. This strategy is likely to involve
a strong competitive element. It is questionable whether any single company
has the ability or expertise to provide all elements of such a capability, whilst
delivering value for money and cost eff ectiveness. The most likely solution will
be a team in which national and international companies co-operate to deliver
the FRES platforms, including the required sub-systems, led by a systems
integrator with the highest level of systems engineering, skills, resources and
capabilities based in the UK. We welcome the international interest in the AFV
market and encourage companies to invest in the UK to develop the IP and
skills to meet our future AFV requirements. We must have suffi cient confi dence
that we can access the IP, design authority and capability to upgrade or
d h fl i d f l i d di i l

###### The technological complexity of AFVs will increase, as evolving threats produce increasingly demanding survivability requirements, and as we seek to realise the benefi ts of Network Enabled Capability

B3.33 About 30% of our planned AFV research needs to be conducted
within Government because of its security classifi cation. We will regularly
review the requirement to conduct this entire portion in-house.


###### The way ahead

B3.35 We will need to work hard with BAE Systems Land Systems,
building on the discussions we have already set in train, and the agreement
reached in December 2005, to give eff ect to the long term partnering
**arrangement required to improve the reliability, availability**
**and eff ectiveness through life of our existing AFV fl eets. Initial**
activity will focus on implementing measures that build confi dence
on both sides. We intend to establish a joint partnering team within
the early part of 2006 and to establish a business transformation plan
underpinned by a robust milestone and performance regime. The plan
will detail the improvements in performance to be achieved, the process
and behavioural changes required of both BAE Systems Land Systems
and the Department, and the capabilities and skills necessary to sustain
through life support to AFVs. Under the partnering agreement with BAE
Systems Land Systems on the existing fl eet we expect to see a signifi cant
evolution of BAE Systems Land Systems both to deliver AFV availability and
upgrades through life, and to bring advanced land systems’ technologies,
skills and processes into the UK, drawing on international capabilities. We
are particularly keen to see a build up in the UK of expertise in the systems
integration of complex land systems. If successful in their evolution, BAE
Systems will be well placed for the forthcoming FRES programme.


B3.34 We currently plan to spend some £140M on research over
the next 10 years, in particular in support of the FRES programme.
However, some of the non-specifi c FRES research funding may be
directed to specifi c entities in order to help sustain those key capabilities
mentioned earlier. Our current research priorities are focussed on:

the capability to assess and produce countermeasures
to emerging enemy threats;

survivability – including novel technologies such as
lightweight armour systems, active protection systems,
electro-optic counter measures, active signature
management and integrated survivability systems;

lethality;
sensor systems;
and integration of vehicles into the wider military network.

###### Defi nition

B4.1 This chapter covers fast jets, air transport, air refuelling, maritime
patrol, airborne surveillance, uninhabited aerial vehicles and important
aerospace sub-systems.

**_Joint Combat Aircraft._**

###### Strategic overview

B4.2 Air power remains a fundamental component of war-fi ghting
capability, complementing maritime and ground forces and providing an
off ensive and defensive capability in its own right. This will be enhanced
by the increasing precision of air-delivered weapons and Network Enabled
Capability (NEC). Air power continues to off er the ability to transform
the battlespace, utilising its inherent attributes of reach and speed to
enable strategic operational and tactical agility.  To further enable this
agility the RAF is undergoing a transformation and reorganisation in line
with the ‘Agile Air Force (aAF) concept’ to establish agile mission groups
capable of rapid reconfi guration to meet dynamic mission requirements.
In addition, as an essential part of our future combat air capability, we
are examining the balance between manned and uninhabited aerial
vehicles. Therefore, whilst there is no current requirement for a newdesign manned aircraft beyond our extant plans, future procurements
of uninhabited and/or manned platforms are envisaged.

B4.3  The aerospace sector faces a potential watershed as increasing market
globalisation, escalating development costs and the absence of any plans
for new design manned fast jet aircraft threatens the continued viability of
the UK’s existing design, development and manufacturing capabilities.

B4.4 This will herald a considerable change both for industry and
Government, demanding a signifi cant shift in culture and ways of working.
However, there is an enduring need to support and upgrade our existing
and planned fl eets of manned aircraft, which are likely to have a service
life of at least 30 years. Moreover, in order to preserve the ability of the
UK to conduct operations without undue dependence on other nations
it will be necessary to preserve a number of capabilities onshore.

###### Equipment programmes

**Fast Jets**

B4.5 **Typhoon is a multi-role combat fi ghter that will replace**
**J** (O f S i D OSD 2007) d h T **d F3 i**


providing superior performance and fl exibility in both the Air Defence
and Strike roles. The two main UK contractors, BAE Systems and RollsRoyce, have been awarded approximately 37.5% of the total 4 nation
work share and are responsible for developing and producing part of
the aircraft and engines respectively. The in-Service Date or ISD was
achieved in 2003, and the currently assumed OSD is in the 2030s.

B4.6 **Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) is the planned solution to the UK’s**
**Joint Combat Aircraft (JCA) requirement which will succeed both**
the Harrier and Sea Harrier (which retires from service in early 2006).
The JSF will be a stealthy fi ghter which will be capable of performing
multi-role operations from land and sea. The UK is a key partner in
the JSF development programme for the US Air Force, US Navy and US
Marine Corps and has invested £2bn to date. The expected ISD is in the
middle of the 2010s, and the currently assumed OSD is in the 2040s.

B4.7 **Tornado GR4 is a 2-seat ground attack aircraft, capable of**
delivering a wide variety of ordnance. The GR4a variant provides a
low level tactical reconnaissance capability. The currently assumed
OSD is in the middle of the 2020s. Looking to the future, we will need
to consider replacing the capability currently provided by the Tornado
GR4. We are alive to the potential military capability that UCAVs may
play in this force mix as a cost eff ective through life capability.

B4.8 By mid 2007, Harrier will be upgraded to GR9 standard
with more powerful engines and electronic systems and able
to employ the latest smart weapons in its close air support
role. The currently assumed OSD is in the late 2010s.

**_Hawk Mk1._**

**Training**

B4.9 **UK Military Flying Training System (UKMFTS) seeks to**
replace the current Flying Training System in order to deliver the required
quantity and quality of aircrew for the three Services, in the most effi cient
and timely manner. UKMFTS achieved Initial Gate approval in Dec 02,
the preferred Procurement Strategy is Public Private Partnerships (PPP),
with component parts of the UKMFTS system procured through a mix of
Private Finance Initiatives (PFI) and Smart conventional procurement.
The Advanced Jet Trainer portion of UKMFTS will be met by the
procurement of Hawk 128; these will replace the current Hawk Mk1
aircraft. A Design and Development contract was let to BAE Systems

**_Sentry._**
**Large Aircraft**

B4.10  C-130 Hercules is the current mainstay of our Tactical Air
Transport Fleet, providing tactical and strategic airlift capability. C-130K
came into service in 1968 and the current fl eet, which comprises 25
aircraft, is planned to be phased out from 2008. 25 of the newer C-130J
are currently in-service, with an assumed OSD early in the 2030s.


Warning And Control System (AWACS) aircraft. Project EAGLE will provide
an upgrade to enable the Sentry aircraft to carry out additional duties, and
bring the UK capability into line with NATO and the US. EAGLE is scheduled
to enter service early next decade. It is anticipated to remain in service
until the mid-2030s. A £665M innovative fl eet availability contract has
been placed with Northrop Grumman (supported by BAE Systems, AAR and
FR Aviation) to maintain the Sentry over the rest of its operational life.

B4.15 **Nimrod MRA4 derived from the existing MR2 aircraft, is a**
completely re-engineered aircraft to deliver a long range capability that
can be tasked for an anti-submarine or anti-surface warfare role or for
search and rescue. Nimrod MRA4 is being developed and produced by
BAE Systems. The currently expected ISD is in the early part of the next
decade, with a currently assumed OSD in the middle of the 2030s.


B4.11 **C-17 plays a key role in fulfi lling the airlift requirements in a wide**
range of operations. It provides the strategic lift capability required to deploy
Rapid Reaction Forces and carries larger loads than the A400M. Four aircraft
are on lease and we have plans to purchase these outright from Boeing at
the end of their lease. We plan to purchase a fi fth aircraft in the early part
of the next decade. The currently assumed OSD is in the early 2030s.

B4.12 **Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft (FSTA) is planned to meet our need**
for a modern tanker aircraft to replace our current VC10 and TriStar fl eets and
support the world-wide operations in which the UK must be ready to participate.
We are expecting to provide the FSTA capability through a PFI, which should give
us a modern, well-equipped fl eet whilst allowing the aircraft to earn commercial
revenue to off set the procurement costs. We are in discussions with AirTanker
Ltd, a consortium comprising EADS, Cobham, Rolls-Royce, Thales and VT Group, to
ensure that a value for money PFI solution can be achieved. The expected ISD is
early in the next decade. OSD will depend on negotiations with the PFI partner.


B4.16 **Nimrod R1 is a derivative of the Maritime Patrol Nimrod MR2.**
the Nimrod R1 has a highly sophisticated suite of systems used for
electronic reconnaissance and intelligence gathering. Project HELIX
will provide an upgrade to the Nimrod R1 capability, enabling it to
be maintained against an evolving and increasingly diverse target
set out to 2025. HELIX includes incremental upgrades to the aircraft
mission systems, associated ground stations and training facilities. The
programme is scheduled for incremental roll-out from 2012 to 2015.

B4.17 The Airborne Stand Off Radar (ASTOR) and its Sentinel
**R Mk1 aircraft will deliver an entirely new capability, providing**
commanders with accurate and timely ground surveillance information
in a wide range of scenarios, from humanitarian aid to combat
operations. It is expected to be in service from 2006 for some 30 years.
As a key element in our future mix of sensor assets. ASTOR will play a
signifi cant role in our eff orts to develop Network Enabled Capability.


###### Indicative planning assumptions

B4.18  Figure B4(i) illustrates our budgetary assumptions in the fi xed wing
sector over the next 10 years. This includes the assumption for the Equipment
Plan (EP), the cost of maintaining and operating the equipment captured
within the Short Term Plan (STP) and the planned research funding to identify
and develop new technologies to support the EP. The relatively constant level
of STP funding assumed for support indicates that industry must strive to limit
the current level of cost growth in the support of newer platforms. On the other
hand, the predicted decline in EP provision means that support to platforms
will become an increasingly more signifi cant part of industry’s business.

tactical and strategic airlift capability to all three Services in peace and
crisis and will become the mainstay of the UK’s tactical transport force. It
is being procured through a collaborative programme now involving seven
European Nations (Germany, France, Turkey, Spain, Belgium, Luxembourg
and the UK). A400M is a Post Main-Gate project being developed and

###### What is required for retention in the UK industrial base?

B4.19 As we are introducing two new highly sophisticated manned
combat fast jet aircraft types which are intended to last for more than 30
years, current plans do not envisage the UK needing to design and build a
future generation of manned fast jet aircraft beyond these types. However,
precisely because the current fl eet and the new types we are introducing
are likely to have such long operational lives, the retention of an aerospace
engineering and design capability is critical for through-life capability
management, in order to provide for maintenance, major upgrade and
integration of new weapon systems, avionics and defensive aids. Until
now, traditional thinking has linked the phases of design and development
inevitably with manufacture. This model now needs to change. The focus
must be on through-life capability management and what is required
to sustain this critical capability in the likely absence of large-scale
manufacture, as these skills can no longer be assumed to be automatically
transferred from new aircraft design. The UK is not alone in having to
face these issues; it applies to the rest of Europe and even to the US.

B4.20 The world market for the large and training aircraft is
not presently a concern, and there is no sovereign requirement to
sustain an indigenous capability in these areas. We will continue to
need, however, the systems engineering and design skills and access
to Intellectual Property Rights for the integration of new mission
systems, avionics and defensive aids into these platforms.

B4. 21  The scale and degree of sovereign support required varies
substantially, predominantly by type and use of aircraft. At one level,
we might need a fit of special equipment to a limited number of aircraft
for a specific mission. Alternatively we may need to conduct a major
re-life programme involving structural and mechanical changes as
well as substantial and sensitive upgrade to the aircraft’s electronics.
There is also a requirement to retain the ability to modify or upgrade
aircraft on a case by case basis through-life for specific purposes to
match UK Defence doctrine, which may not be reflected by other
nations.  For example, it is important that a UK-based weapon system
integration and system interface capability exists in order to ensure
safe operation of any UK air system, including the integration of new
technology. Retention of this capability onshore also assists in sustaining
an important intelligent customer capability for non-UK designed
aircraft. In other areas we may be prepared to accept other solutions.

B4.22 **Safe and Lawful Operation of Aircraft: In order to**
comply with UK safety legislation and airworthiness standards,
it will be necessary for our suppliers (onshore and offshore) to
retain an understanding of our standards and processes. This is
particularly important in the area of safety critical software systems
and the integration, test and evaluation of new weapons.

**Aerospace systems and enabling**
**skills and technologies**

B4.23 Whilst the UK will have an enduring need for access to
world leading technology across the range of aerospace systems, it
is neither practical nor aff ordable to retain all the relevant skills and
technologies onshore. Our focus, therefore, is to identify and preserve
the key underpinning skills and technologies that will allow the UK to
conduct operations and deploy new world-class systems without undue
dependence on other nations. The preservation of carefully targeted
world-leading skills, techniques and technologies will also allow onshore
companies to provide key elements of future collaborative programmes,
i UK i i fl h


B4.24 **Mission Systems provide the means by which air platforms of all**
types (including manned, uninhabited, fast jet, large and helicopters) deliver
their essential capability. They also provide a key component of an aircraft’s
ability to survive and defend itself. A key part of air systems design is the
integration of systems and data within an aircraft, and integration of the
aircraft within the wider command, control and information environment of
the battle-space. Sensor fusion techniques are key to rationalising the masses
of incoming sensor data, whilst the ability to produce high quality mission and
safety critical software systems is needed to deliver safe, high performance
systems. Mission management and information exchange systems are
required to enable integrated operations in joint and coalition environments.

**Examples of Mission Systems include:**

**Electro-Optical (EO) sensors are critical to**
combat identifi cation, precision attack, terrain
avoidance, reconnaissance, visual augmentation
/ night vision and missile approach warning.

**Radar is critical to situational awareness, air to air and air to**
surface attack (including combat identifi cation and missile
guidance), ground mapping and all-weather operations.

**Electronic Support Measures (ESM) provides the**
ability to identify emissions from enemy platforms and
weapon systems in order to provide warning and spatial
awareness of threats to prompt defensive action.
**Defensive Aids Systems (DAS) go beyond ESM to provide**
the means to detect, jam, deceive and defend against threats.

B4.25 There is a strong UK based capability in the Mission Systems area,
which has enabled the UK to deploy world-class capability without undue
dependence on other nations, and to participate in international future
programmes, such as JSF, with market-leading technology. However, this
capability is now threatened by an intermittent fl ow of new programmes.

###### Overview of the current global and UK aerospace market

B4.26 The European and US aerospace market, both civilian and
military, is reasonably buoyant at present. Civil aircraft production is
expected to increase by more than 40% between 2004 and 2009.


B4.27 The defence market is also entering a new phase of activity
with the Dassault Rafale and Typhoon in production and the JSF
nearing production. Lockheed Martin is the world’s largest defence
contractor, with 2004 sales of $35.5 billion and 33% of their sales in
the Aeronautic (Aerospace) sector. Some estimate[1] that the worldwide
fi ghter market could be worth some £9Bn p.a. by 2011 with some
30 countries needing to replace aircraft over the next fi ve years.

B4.28 The defence aerospace market, however, is changing. Budgets
are focused increasingly on fewer but more capable and fl exible multi-role
platforms, such as JSF and Typhoon. The trend towards fewer, smaller fl eets
of ever-more sophisticated, capable and expensive platforms has driven
recent changes in the European and US aerospace defence industry. The
main consideration for the major suppliers is that there will be a potentially
signifi cant reduction in new military aircraft design and development work.


B4.31  There has been similar consolidation in the defence electronics
sector. Following a series of agreements struck with BAE Systems,
Finmeccanica has become Europe’s second biggest operator in the
defence and security electronics sector, and the world’s sixth biggest
through its three SELEX companies[2], and Smiths Aerospace has
developed into one of the leading transatlantic aerospace equipment
and systems companies, with more than 10,000 staff and nearly
$2bn revenues split between Europe and North America.

B4.32 The role of prime contractor is also changing to one focused more
on development of systems architectures facilitating insertion of other
suppliers’ sub-systems, rather than vertically integrated models. We will need
to rely increasingly on specialist contractors for individual sub-systems and
components for the insertion of new technologies and capabilities into our
aircraft fl eets. The major prime contractors are generally, by nature, defence
companies and must remain focused on defence markets. They may have
adjacent businesses in the civil sector, for example defence and civil aerospace
interests, but these are largely driven by diff erent business models. Further
down the supply chain there is more scope for leveraging common technology
and capability between civil and defence sides of the business and some
businesses have highly diversifi ed and often international portfolios. This
implies that prime contractors may be more likely to face sustainment issues.

B4.33 Rolls-Royce is one of the world’s largest military aero engine
manufacturers following a number of acquisitions including the
US Allison Engine Company and BMW’s aero-engine division. The
US companies General Electric and Pratt & Whitney and the French
company SNECMA are now the other major players in the industry.


###### B4


**_Typhoon._**

B4.29 The trend is for collaborative working, either because no single
company has the full set of capabilities required to produce world-standard
aircraft, or because nations need to collaborate to share costs and each
wishes to see some element of the work performed within its territory. This
can be clearly seen with both Typhoon (four partner nations: UK, Germany,
Italy and Spain) and JSF (nine nations partnering in the development
phase: USA, UK, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey, Canada, Denmark, Norway
and Australia). Indeed, the UK has not designed and manufactured a
fast jet on its own since the Hawk, fi rst developed in the late 1960s-early
1970s with new variants continuing to be designed indigenously now.


B4.30 Consolidation has become a dominant theme. All tiers of the supply
chain have been aff ected, although at the higher tiers the implications have
been more severe. For example, BAE Systems has grown from the merging of
14 aerospace companies within the UK, and EADS combines the capabilities
once housed within Aerospatiale, Matra, Dassault (France), CASA (Spain) and
DASA (Germany), national companies which themselves were the product
of previous mergers. These two companies now dominate the defence fi xed
wing aircraft market within Europe, primarily via the Airbus Military Company
(A400M) and the Typhoon programme. EADS also holds a major shareholding
in Dassault Aviation, the manufacturer of Rafale. Similarly, BAE Systems holds
a 20.5% stake in SAAB AB, the manufacturer of the Swedish Gripen aircraft.

**_A C-130 Hercules lands at the austere airstrip of Archers Post in Kenya._**

B4.34 The US market, driven by larger defence budgets and greater scale of
production, will off er increasingly important opportunities for those aerospace
companies able to gain access to US programmes. Both the major European
primes, BAE Systems and EADS have opportunities in this arena, the former
due to its presence in the JSF programme and its increasing US focus (bolstered
by US acquisitions) and the latter potentially via its teaming with US primes on
current US programmes. Rolls-Royce is also playing a key role in taking forward
the JSF programme. Indeed, their contribution is central to the STOVL variant.


B4.35 The future aerospace market might show a signifi cant shift to
the widespread use of uninhabited platforms, a fi eld in which US and
Israeli companies have notable experience. European companies, including
BAE Systems and EADS, are also active in this fi eld, with all seeking to
develop competitive advantage in what appears to be a growth area.

###### Sustainment strategy

B4.36 The issues facing the Aerospace Sector are a matter of
**mutual concern to Government and Industry alike. The**
Defence Industrial Strategy gives timely context for this.

B4.37 At one level, we need to be clear that both the nature and volume
of customer demand are changing, with implications for the industrial base.
**The coming decline in new programme work will have an impact on**
**the UK industrial footprint, in particular around BAE Air Systems’ four main**
production sites (Warton and Samlesbury in Lancashire, Brough in the East
Riding of Yorkshire and Woodford in Cheshire). The challenge is to manage this
transition and sustain in the UK – in the absence of major new programmes
– the industrial skills, capabilities and technologies that are required to sustain
our ability to operate, support, maintain and upgrade our aircraft over the next
30 years.  MOD has been working closely with BAE Systems, as the UK’s
**only supplier of fast jets, for some time to understand these mutual**
**challenges. We are committed to continuing this dialogue with a view**
to fi nding a solution that meets the defence needs, now and in the future,
recognising that this will need to make commercial sense for the company.

B4.38 This is likely to demand a long-term and strategic approach. To
that end, MOD and BAE Systems intend to work together to explore how
a long term partnering arrangement for the through-life availability of
a signifi cant proportion of the fi xed-wing fl eet might be delivered. Such
an approach, if delivered, would allow rationalisation (to take out surplus
capacity), improved effi ciency and better ways of working, capacity
management (to smooth workloads), exit and step-in provisions, and
open-book accounting; there has to be alignment of objectives. Specifi cally,
incentivised platform availability and in some cases platform capability
contracts with industry will be crucial to the future delivery of operational
output at the frontline. It will demand changes on both sides to conduct
business diff erently, and is probably best achieved through a phased
approach so that the risks can be progressively tackled - and success, for both
parties, assured. This needs to extend through the entire aerospace supply
chain, as all have a part to play in delivering this capability through-life.

B4.39 Our need to retain a minimum level of onshore capability
does not necessarily mean that we will need to support all aspects of
our aircraft in the UK. This is because generic capabilities and skills
developed to support one aircraft type may be brought to bear on another,
depending upon similarity of type, role, technology and complexity.
In considering whether to retain an onshore support capability for any
particular aircraft fl eet, we will fi rst determine where the best value
for money can be obtained. Where this is off shore, we will assess any
implications of pursuing that route on our ability to preserve a minimum
capability across the breadth of our business. Thus, at the strategic
level, we will manage what amounts to a portfolio approach.

B4.40 For any particular aircraft type there may also be a middle
ground where, to secure value for money for example, we may rely on
off -shore suppliers for major upgrade but retain onshore maintenance,
support and Urgent Operational Requirements (UORs) capabilities.

B4.41   For Typhoon, we will design a cost eff ective and aff ordable national
support solution, incorporating best practices from lean and end-to-end
principles. We intend to work with our quadrinational partners to eff ect this.
However, major changes must be made in the management and operation
of the supply chain to incentivise continued improvements in the support
arrangements for this aircraft, ensuring that we retain onshore our ability to
satisfy our sovereign requirements over its lifetime. Clearly, BAE Systems, and,
for the engines and mission systems respectively, Rolls-Royce, Smiths Aerospace
dS l S dAi b S illh i ifi l l i hi


B4.42  For JSF, the through life support of the UK aircraft will be
provided from the Lockheed Martin Global Support System which is
being established on a co-operative basis amongst the 9 JSF partner
nations. This will provide support, through performance based contracts,
to the JSF fl eet. As part of this performance based arrangement, the UK
also intends to establish sovereign support capabilities which would
provide, inter alia, in country facilities to maintain, repair and upgrade
the UK fl eet and an Integrated Pilot and Maintainer Training Centre. Our
aim, endorsed by the US Department of Defence (DOD) and agreed with
Lockheed Martin, is that BAE Systems as a key JSF Industry partner to
Lockheed Martin will provide these support services in the UK under a
Team JSF badge with contracts fl owing from the MOD to DOD to Team JSF.
There is no fundamental defence requirement for a JSF Final Assembly
and Check Out (FACO) facility, although an on-going joint study with DTI/
BAE Systems, due to conclude in early 2006, is seeking to assess whether
a UK FACO is necessary to preserve essential engineering skills within BAE
Systems and would be a cost eff ective solution or whether alternatives
would provide a better outcome in terms of sustaining core skills.


**Propulsion**

Power systems are central in the air, as well as at sea. In this fi eld, RollsRoyce are a champion within the UK defence industry, and a world
leader in aero-engines, marine and land systems. 100% of our major
warships and 80% of our aircraft are powered by Rolls-Royce engines.

We will wish to retain in the UK the ability to support and upgrade
our platforms through-life, and sub-systems, including engines- often
extremely complex in their own right- are often the key route to
improving reliability and other aspects of capability. Rolls-Royce is
already playing a signifi cant role as a strategic partner to the MOD
in this area- as demonstrated by the innovative through-life engine
support arrangements already in place for Harrier, VC-10 and Nimrod.

We will also continue to invest in propulsion technologies
where these show potential application to our future needs.
New work includes the Aff ordable Combat Engine Technology
TDP, in which we will invest about £12.4M over 4 years.


B4.43 We will also engage closely with our major suppliers to
review the applicability of civil **standards to military aircraft. This**
will allow us to gain maximum leverage from the UK civil aerospace
market and to focus our resources more specifi cally on sustaining
capabilities that are unique to the military environment.

**Aerospace systems and enabling**
**skills and technologies**

B4.44 Further work to identify strategically important underpinning skills
and technologies will be undertaken, which we hope will be completed by
Autumn 2006, and we will work closely with industry to understand how
these might be retained onshore. Our general strategy will be to target
more accurately our existing research budget, possibly through research
partnerships. This will help UK industry to identify and exploit new techniques
and technologies and to remain at the technological forefront of new
developments. We do not envisage any signifi cant investment in production
facilities; rather we expect to benefi t from downstream economy of scale
savings as a result of military export sales and commercial exploitation.


-----

**Uninhabited Air Vehicles (UAVs) and**
**Uninhabited Combat Air Vehicles (UCAVs)**

B4.45 We and industry share a close alignment of interest in UAV and
UCAV technology. Although at present we have no funded UCAV programme,
targeted investment in UCAV technology demonstrator programmes would
help to sustain the very aerospace engineering and design capabilities
that we need to provide assurance of our ability to operate and support
our future fi xed wing aircraft. Such investment would also ensure that
we can make better informed decisions on the future mix of manned and
uninhabited aircraft which will need to be taken in the 2010-2015 timeframe.
Additionally, the benefi t for UK industry is the opportunity to develop a
competitive edge in a potentially lucrative military and civil market.


###### The way ahead

B4.50 We need to develop the dialogue in which we have been engaged
by commencing negotiations with BAE Systems in earnest on
**the terms of the business rationalisation and transformation**
**agreement required to facilitate the eff ective sustainment of the**
**industrial skills, capability and technologies – wherever they may**
**be in the supply chain – that will be so important to our ability**
**to operate, support and upgrade our fast jet combat aircraft**
**through life. We aim on working with the company during 2006 to agree**
the way ahead – which will be challenging given the scope of the scale of
the transformation that is required – and to implement it from 2007.


B4.46 In the context of the wider discussions with the industry around
consolidation and transformation, we are considering ways in which we can
take such an aspiration forward. BAE Systems is leading a UK industry team
working on UAV technologies, following some recent very successful company
and MOD-funded technology demonstration programmes. This work has
pioneered a range of agile project management techniques; an absolute
focus on key objectives, a fast decision making process, and rapid prototyping
and engineering. This approach, which we are keen to use more widely,
has signifi cantly cut the time in which new ideas and technologies can be
realised and demonstrated. For example, BAE Systems’ own Raven UAV went
from concept to fi rst fl ight in ten months. Building on the success of these
programmes, we intend to move forward subject to a value for money business
case being demonstrated and appropriate commercial arrangements being in
place with a more substantial TDP ( Technology Demonstrator Programmes)
designed to give us and industry a better understanding of key technologies
of relevance to UAVs and UCAVs more broadly. This would be a joint eff ort
with MOD and industry contributing to the costs. We hope that appropriate
arrangements will be in place to allow this activity to proceed in 2006.

**The challenge ahead**


###### B4


B4.47 The aerospace sector is facing a tough challenge. The UK has
not had the capability to design and manufacture on its own the most
advanced combat jets for a long time, and yet the principal onshore supplier
of fi xed wing military aircraft has four sites dedicated to air systems. The
current size of the air sector is not sustainable, and rationalisation and
reduction in terms of both infrastructure and employment is inevitable.

B4.48 The MOD recognises the diffi culties that reduction in planned new
programmes is likely to entail, and we will work with BAE Systems and the
other companies in the defence aerospace sector so that it can reach the
appropriate size and shape for the demand. With this process, we can help
the sector to remain a healthy, competitive and profi table one that can
survive into the long term to meet our changing future requirements. Without
it, the inevitable reduction in the global defence aerospace industry will
happen anyway, but in a less structured and ordered way and not necessarily
with the UK at the forefront - to the detriment of the companies and their
employees.  But if we, MOD and industry, face this challenge up-front,
together, we can ensure that the UK is well positioned for the future.


B4.49 Our plans to retain onshore the industrial capabilities required to
ensure eff ective through-life support to the existing and planned fast jet fl eet

- and to invest in developing UCAV technology - will also provide us with the
core industrial skills required to contribute to any future international manned
fast jet programme, should the requirement for one emerge. This recognises
both the uncertainty of our very long term requirements - with the possibility
that we shall want to replace elements of the Typhoon and Joint Strike
Fighter fl eets with manned aircraft - and that we should avoid continuing to

###### Helicopters
### B5


###### Defi nition

B5.1 This chapter addresses helicopters and those systems that are unique
to them; other avionic systems are addressed in the Aerospace chapter.

###### Strategic overview

B5.2 Helicopters play a major role in the UK’s military operations. The
Battlefi eld Helicopter (BH) fl eet has recently operated in a wide variety
of theatres, including urban and rural areas in Northern Ireland, the Iraqi
desert, the mountains of Afghanistan and the jungles of Sierra Leone.

**_Chinook Mk2 transporting a Light Gun during Op SILKMAN Sierra Leone._**

B5.3 Helicopters are inherently responsive, adaptable and fl exible,
and contribute to a variety of military tasks. They can operate in a
very wide range of combat and environmental conditions. Therefore
to be an eff ective component of a balanced expeditionary force they
need to have high reliability and availability and require the minimum
possible deployed logistic support equipment and infrastructure.

B5.4 **The Future Rotorcraft Capability (FRC) programme was created**
in July 2004, to identify a future strategy that maximised the capability that
could be delivered from available funding. The FRC programme was directed
to explore opportunities to use each helicopter type to deliver more than
one capability, reduce the number of types of helicopters in-service and
promote off -the-shelf (OTS) solutions, limiting unique UK requirements to the
essential in order to drive down costs of ownership. To understand better the
nature of future helicopters requirements, a FRC taxonomy was agreed and
used to defi ne the overall capability, recognising that individual platforms
contribute routinely across the capability domains. For combat helicopters,
three capability domains of Attack, Find and Lift were identifi ed and, within
each, separate environmental requirements for Land and Maritime:

|Capability Domain|Description|
|---|---|
|Attack|A helicopter capable of autonomous and co- operative attack using appropriate weapons against surface (land and maritime) and sub-surface targets|
|Find|A helicopter capable of autonomous action, which provides tactical commanders with reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition|
|Lift|A helicopter capable of a vertical-lift capability to support military operations, which must enable the rapid deployment, in-theatre movement, re-supply and extraction of joint forces and their equipment|


###### Helicopters
### B5


B5.5 The requirement to move ship-based troops and equipment
to the onshore Battlespace is known as Littoral Manoeuvre
and is captured in the Land elements of the taxonomy.

B5.6 A number of early priorities have been agreed during an initial
phase of analysis to drive the delivery of improved capability in the early
years. These included: sustaining the capability currently provided by
Land and Maritime Lynx and Gazelle aircraft; securing a value for money
approach to modernising the maritime Merlin Mk1; progressing with a
helicopter-based replacement search and rescue (SAR) capability; and
undertaking restorative measures in Lift. Work necessary to defi ne how
much, and when, to invest further in the Land Lift capability, including
the balance between Medium and Large Lift aircraft, will be undertaken
in the Land Advanced Concept Phase (LACP), reporting in late 2006.

B5.7 Search and Rescue (SAR) activities in the UK, Falkland Islands
and Cyprus are treated as a separate capability area, as are basic
helicopter training needs (provided by the Defence Helicopter Flying
School), support to training activities and general liaison roles.

###### Equipment programmes

B5.8 The Merlin Mk1 Capability Sustainment Programme (CSP)
aims to ensure continuity of capability and introduce an open-systems
architecture to the Royal Navy’s (RN) airborne Anti-Submarine Warfare
(ASW) capability. It will also enable the cost-eff ective management
of obsolescence on an aircraft which has components and design
features that are becoming diffi cult to support. This programme is
scheduled to achieve its In-Service-Date (ISD) in the middle of the next
decade. Merlin Mk1 is likely to remain in-service into the 2030s.

B5.9 Replacements are needed for capabilities provided by the
Lynx and Gazelle aircraft in service with both the Army and the RN. The
preferred solution, currently undergoing detailed analysis to ensure,
amongst other aspects, its value for money, for these requirements is the
**Future Lynx performing as the Army’s Battlefi eld Reconnaissance**
**Helicopter (BRH) capability and the RN Surface Combatant Maritime**
**Rotorcraft (SCMR), although some Gazelle will be retained in the**
non-combat training, support and liaison roles. Both BRH and SCMR
are scheduled to be delivered in the middle of the next decade.


-----

B5.13 In addition, the existing fl eet of 67 Apache Attack Helicopters
**(AH) will continue to meet the Attack role in the Land environment until its**
currently assumed OSD in around 25 years. Work is ongoing to determine
how the AH can be sustained through life, including investigations to extend
its potential OSD by another 10 years. This will be co-ordinated with the US
Army programme to reduce costs and produce appropriate commonality.

###### Indicative planning assumptions


**_Interior of Merlin helicopter of 824 Naval Air Squadron._**

B5.10 A package of work known as the Chinook Mk2/2A coherence
**programme has been launched to establish a single confi guration**
baseline for the Chinook fl eet and is expected to be completed early in
the next decade. This work will enable a reduction in the overall cost
of supporting a fl eet with disparate equipment standards due to the
fi tting of a large number of partially integrated equipments in support
of operations. It is also an essential precursor for the integration of the
Bowman communications system and will enable a future Chinook
capability sustainment programme, should it be decided to extend
the life of the platform. This work is expected to complete around the
turn of the decade. Assessments are also well underway on the work
necessary to fi eld the 8 Chinook Mk3s procured from Boeing in the late
1990s which are not in service as we have been unable to certify their
airworthiness. A decision will be taken next year on whether to proceed.

###### B5


B5.11 Currently, the majority of Search and Rescue (SAR) helicopters
in the UK are provided by the RAF and RN, with the remainder provided
by civilian helicopters under contract to the Maritime & Coastguard
Agency. It is planned to begin to replace this capability with a single
contract that retains a proportion of military aircrews to enable operational
readiness of Combat SAR crews in the middle of the next decade.

B5.12 The LACP will make recommendations on our future Lift capability
and the appropriate balance of investment on how this should be taken
forward. Key to this activity will be determining the balance between
investing in new equipment or sustaining and enhancing present lift
helicopters. The Puma, Sea King Mk4, Merlin Mk3 and Chinook Mk2/2A will
all need investment if their contribution to the Lift capability is to be extended
beyond the middle of the next decade, since all will reach their planned
OSDs or require obsolescence issues to be addressed within this timeframe.


B5.14 Figure B5(i) shows the current profi le of funding assumed for
all helicopters within the Equipment Programme (EP). We currently
expect to spend an average of £600 million a year on support costs
over the next ten years. Our goal is to reduce the cost of ownership
by: exploiting new airframes; innovative support arrangements;
improved commonality of equipment training and support solutions;
and streamlining acceptance and release-to-service arrangements.

_which does not distort the overall illustrative picture of general trends._


B5.15 The MOD has various helicopter Private Finance Initiatives (PFI),
which sit outside the FRC and AH programmes, which the Joint Helicopter
Command (JHC), the RAF and the RN use to provide aircraft for the Military
Flying Training School (MFTS), training support, surveillance, VIP fl ights
and other non-operational liaison tasks, mainly in the UK, but also in
Belize, Brunei and Cyprus. These contracts amount to over sixty aircraft,
which are Civilian Owned Military Registered (COMR) and equal spend
of about £42M per annum to industry. It is also likely that a COMR-type
solution will be sought in the future to replace the training support and
non-combat liaison tasks currently undertaken by Gazelle. In addition, there
may be scope to combine some or all of these contracts in due course.

###### What is required for retention within the UK industrial base?


**_A_** **_h_**


B5.16 **Support of current aircraft – The retention onshore of those**
skills critical to the through-life support of our current UK designed aircraft
is essential, in particular to ensure the airworthiness of the platform.
This includes modifi cation and programmed upgrades, which typically
includes the provision of new sensors and defensive aids, structural repair
and the urgent insertion of new capability in direct support of ongoing
operations. These skills are primarily resident in AgustaWestland, the
original manufacturer of much of the in-service fl eet, and will need
to be sustained to ensure our current aircraft can be supported.

B5.17 **Systems engineering – In order to address the demands of the**
future network-enabled battlespace a broad spectrum of systems engineering
skills will be required, not least to help ensure the support of our existing
i f b d k Wi h h kill b bl

upgrade and insert new technologies into the existing fl eet. These skills range
from the integration of platform, powerplant, navigation and communications
systems through to the more complex integration of mission system, sensors
and processors. We would also wish a modelling and simulation capacity
to be retained within the UK. We expect that these skills will be sustained
through ongoing helicopter acquisition and upgrade programmes and
other major Defence activities outside the helicopters environment. For
example, Merlin CSP will help maintain and enhance those required skills
at Lockheed Martin in Havant (the Design Authority for this system) and
Thales UK (as a signifi cant equipment provider). We would also wish to
exploit the wider capacity available to multinational companies, not least by
managing workloads more effi ciently across the breadth of those companies.

**Key technologies to enhance future**
**platform development**

B5.18 As helicopters cover a wide span of technologies and enabling
areas of expertise, the totality would be unaff ordable to sustain
through our demands alone. However, there are particularly important
technologies for helicopters within niche areas, which provide the
Armed Forces with unique capabilities and off er leverage in our cooperation with allies and the broader design and manufacturing base.

B5.19 **Rotor blades - Rotor blade technology is a key area of UK**
expertise that has, for example, allowed the 15 tonne Merlin Mk1 aircraft
to operate within the same maritime rotor diameter constraint as the 10
tonne Sea King variant which it replaced. The UK has been instrumental
in investigating performance and enhancing blades. Looking ahead,
this technology off ers better range and payload capabilities and could
lead to lower whole life costs and vibration. Investment in the British
Experimental Rotor Programme (BERP) technology will continue until the
technology has been matured and successfully demonstrated in fl ight.
This will sustain the skill base, although decisions about integration of
BERP IV blades onto our helicopter fl eet will be made on their merits.

B5.20 **Mission systems – The threat spectrum in which helicopters**
operate places a premium on situational awareness, augmented
by on-board decision-making aids and enhanced Human Machine
Interface (HMI) integration, such as speaker-independent voice control.
The design and manufacture of compact, world-leading sonar and
radar systems is an example of where the UK plays a leading role in
helicopter-specifi c mission systems. Continued investment in the COvert
Night Day Operations Rotorcraft (CONDOR) technology development
programme, which could off er exploitation opportunities around the
middle of the next decade, will help to sustain this skill base.

B5.21 **Survivability – Helicopter Survivability requires a systems**
approach across a broad spread of capabilities including those Electro-Optical
(EO) sensors, Radar, Electronic Support Measures (ESM) and Defensive Aids
Systems (DAS) essential to underpin the UK’s land and maritime capabilities.
It is a sensitive and critical capability that provides choice to the commander
in the pursuit of his mission. We intend to protect the security of supply
of these underpinning technologies and to minimise the opportunities
for our adversaries to counter those systems through knowledge of their
operation. We will retain the ability to manufacture prototypes, test
and evaluate potential solutions and use crew-in-the-loop simulation
to develop tactics to support ongoing UK operational commitments.

B5.22 **Vibration management - The UK’s ability to design, prototype and**
validate active vibration management systems off ers signifi cant military and
cost of ownership benefi ts. The ability lies in a physics-level understanding
of how vibrations are transmitted through the helicopter and addressing
hi h h i hi i i h i hi h l


heavily on trial and error methods. The technology enables members of the
Armed Forces to remain operationally eff ective in an otherwise disruptive
environment caused by the vibrations from the platform. It has been
fi tted onto Merlin Mk1. We will sustain this expertise through continued
research, linked to improved exploitation with industrial partners.

**_HMS ARK ROYAL in the Northern Arabian Gulf, is resupplied_**
**_by a Royal Navy Sea King of 820 Naval Air Squadron._**

B5.23 **Electronic architecture – There are a variety of electronic systems**
which are vital to both the safe fl ight of helicopters and also their ability
to fi ght on the battlefi eld. As a minimum we would wish to retain the
knowledge of the controlling and source software within such capabilities as:

Infra Red (IR) systems
Electro-Optic (EO) sensors
Mission management software
Electronic Warfare (EW) systems

###### Overview of the current global defence market

B5.24 **Market background – The fi ve major manufacturers**
in the global helicopter market are Boeing, Sikorsky, Eurocopter,
AgustaWestland and Bell. Each harnesses the majority of its revenue
from military sales, which are predicted to grow by 60% over the next
decade, as a result of the US helicopter programme. The civil market
is likely to remain relatively static in comparison. This represents a
signifi cant opportunity, following recent success in the US Presidential
helicopter replacement programme, for AgustaWestland as both
Future Lynx and Merlin have excellent export potential, particularly
in the maritime segment of the future helicopter market.

B5.25 Reductions in defence spending in all European Union countries has
driven a marked fall-back in the amount of funds available for the research
and development of new capabilities. As a consequence, further integration
is likely to be required in the European market, and access to the US market
will be critical to the viability of all helicopter manufacturers. We believe
the UK has an important advantage due to its close links with the US.

###### Overview of the current UK defence market

B5.26 The UK helicopter market is dominated by AgustaWestland,
who currently provide the in-service and through-life support
to the majority of the UK’s helicopter fl eet. AgustaWestland
form part of the Finmeccanica group of companies.

B5.27 **Lockheed Martin UK, part of the wider Lockheed Martin**
i h i f h RN M li Mk1 fl f i f


-----

B5.28 The majority of our helicopter repair and overhaul is
undertaken by the Defence Aviation Repair Agency (DARA), a
trading fund of the MOD. The Department has recently announced
that it will consider taking to the market DARA’s rotary wing and
associated components in order to test whether their sale might deliver
improved eff ectiveness and value for money for the Armed Forces.

B5.29 UK helicopter sub-contractors include Thales UK who are a major
supplier of avionics and other sub-systems for helicopters such as mission
systems and radios and are also the prime contractor for the conversion of
the Sea King ASaC Mk7 aircraft. Rolls-Royce Defence Aerospace support
the GEM, GNOME and RTM322 (in conjunction with TurboMecca) helicopter
engines. Westland Transmissions Ltd design and develop helicopter
transmission systems and Smiths Industries provide a variety of electronic
and fl ight control systems. Both General Dynamics UK and Selex Sensors
**and Airborne Systems provide avionics and information management**
systems for helicopters. AgustaWestland and QinetiQ also provide particular
capability in devising the Vibration Management technology outlined above.

**_Merlin operating in Iraq._**


and depth of the industry’s capacity, both in the UK and from abroad.
B5.33 In managing better our current fl eet and the transition to the
future we intend to develop further our IOS arrangements towards a
common approach with industry in meeting our broad capability needs
over time. As we recently announced, we would hope the envisaged
sale of DARA Fleetlands will provide the opportunity to create a more
robust and profi table support base in the UK. Finally, we will encourage
the development and exploitation of key niche technologies, acting
where appropriate in close co-operation with our allies and industry.

**Sustainment of the existing fl eet**


B5.34 Sustainment of the existing fl eet entails the provision of necessary
support arrangements and an ability to respond to airworthiness issues,
crash investigations (including the delivery of any remedial action) and the
eff ective and timely embodiment of capability enhancements, sometimes
at very short notice. This requires a wide spectrum of engineering skills
(including structural design, aerodynamics, dynamic systems, avionics
integration, powerplant integration, test and evaluation and software
design), knowledge of UK military demands and safety standards, plus
competence in the integration of sub-systems into aircraft. These skills are
sometimes collectively referred to as a Design Authority (DA) capability.

**AgustaWestland**

B5.35 For the majority of our existing aircraft, AgustaWestland have
a DA role: for Lynx, Sea King and the battlefi eld variant of Merlin they
are the platform and systems DA; they are the platform DA for the RN
Merlin; for Apache, they have a role to co-ordinate inputs of platform
and systems; and for Puma and Gazelle, they are the DA for UK specifi c
systems. The sustainment of these skills requires a suffi ciency in each
discipline to ensure a depth of knowledge, experience and eff ective
succession management. The professionalism and eff ectiveness of
**this skill-base is best sustained by ensuring that individuals are**
**faced with ‘high tech’ engineering challenges, typically only found**
**in helicopter design, development or demonstration activities.**


###### B5


**Trends**

B5.30 The helicopter industry and its sources of revenue are changing,
increasingly moving away from the provision of equipment to contracting
for services and involving industry in the direct support of operations.


B5.31 Contracting for Availability, Integrated Operational Support (IOS)
and Through-Life Customer Support solutions will require a number of
industrial competencies to respond to helicopter capability requirements.
These new arrangements do not signifi cantly change the technical
demands to support the platforms, but they do generate a requirement
for industry to transform to a new business model where industry is
incentivised to improve helicopter availability and reliability through-life.

###### Sustainment strategy


**General**

B5.32 Within the context of our agreed FRC strategy, our sustainment
strategy seeks to develop a closer, more transparent relationship with
the helicopter industrial sector in order to deliver a more coherent and
cost-eff ective through-life capability. We intend to sustain a strong
systems engineering capability, although it is not an absolute sovereign
requirement to maintain a separate national helicopter design and
production capability within the UK for new aircraft. However, we will
actively encourage appropriate partnering arrangements with industry
where it makes sense in terms of better value for money, maintaining
appropriate sovereignty over our helicopter capability and in enabling business
f i W ld h d h b d h


B5.36 The AgustaWestland skill-base is at present exercised through
export opportunities and sub-contract work on Merlin Mk1 and the US
Presidential Helicopter, but this is insuffi cient to sustain the breadth and
depth of engineering skills required nor support the transformation of
the company. Therefore, to meet the BRH and SCMR requirement our
**preferred solution is to invest in the Future Lynx product, currently**
undergoing detailed capability and value for money assessment, as it
appears to provide the required military capability and also sustains the
necessary DA capacity at the company in the short to medium-term.

B5.37 We also intend to promote a more open, predictable but
**demanding partnered relationship with AgustaWestland, to**
**realise business transformation within the company. We wish**
**this transformation to provide better value for money and**
**reduce their reliance on our investment to sustain this design**
**engineering skill-base. This work will also assess how partnering**
will help drive coherence in, and value for money from, the future
support arrangements for our current helicopters and other contracts
placed with AgustaWestland. We intend this process to be both
**challenging and as open as commercial confi dences will allow.**


**Integrated Operational Support**

B5.38 **We have already started work with a number of helicopter**
**suppliers to implement revised and novel arrangements to**
**t** **t l tf** **th** **h l** **t** **t** **d**


-----

**contracts that require industry to provide serviceable aircraft**
**at the front-line. An Integrated Operational Support (IOS) approach**
for Sea King is in place and similar approaches are being considered for
other aircraft. This is already delivering improved performance in aircraft
sustainability and availability, together with associated management
information to facilitate performance management. At present, tailored
arrangements have been pursued on an aircraft-by-aircraft basis, but we
**intend to focus eff orts on ensuring these initiatives converge**
**and that lessons are learnt, shared and implemented.**

**_Humanitarian aid is off loaded from a RAF Puma in Mozambique._**

**Wider industrial engagement for the future**

B5.39 We will explore how partnering contracts and concepts can be
utilised in areas of the helicopter sector. But it is important to be clear
**that we will continue to look to the vibrant and competitive global**
**market place to satisfy our future helicopter requirement with**
**AgustaWestland’s role neither predefi ned nor guaranteed, but**
**dependent on their performance and the value for money of their**
**propositions. The support arrangements for our future helicopter fl eets,**
irrespective of their source of supply, will also be determined on value for
money arguments (recognising that it will be important to be clear that
they are coherent with existing support infrastructure and capabilities).


B5.40 We also plan to work with Boeing to improve the through-life
support arrangements to our Chinook fl eet. This supports our aspiration
for eff ective capability management for current aircraft. Boeing, as the
DA for the Chinook aircraft, is best placed to undertake the necessary
logistical transformation needed in the supply chain that ensures Chinook
can be upgraded when we wish in order to develop military capability.
Much of the work will be spilt between DARA for depth maintenance
and the front-line base to ensure a viable onshore presence.

**Exploiting research**

B5.41 We will continue to invest in research in support of the development
of key helicopter related technologies. This investment averages approximately
£13M per year and it is anticipated that it will remain at this level for the
foreseeable future. Our priorities include: enhanced helicopter survivability;
operations in Day/Night and all weather and adverse environmental
conditions; improved mission decision support systems; research into
improving mission performance; and ways of reducing whole life costs.

###### The way ahead

B5.42 We need to drive forward with AgustaWestland the
**implementation of the business transformation partnering**
**arrangement that we committed to through the Heads of Agreement**
signed in April 2005. A partnering team (jointly resourced by MOD and
AgustaWestland) has, for the last six months, been exploring partnering
opportunities across those areas of the business indicated in the Heads of
Agreement. We hope that by the Spring of 2006, subject to value
**for money having been demonstrated, we will have reached**
**agreement on a Strategic Partnering Arrangement (SPA) which**
will be focused on activities to sustain the design engineering skills and
knowledge of UK military demands and safety standards within the
company necessary for them to provide eff ective through-life support
to those elements of the in-service helicopter fl eet for which they are
the DA. The SPA is intended to commit both parties to specifi c targets
on, inter alia, cost and schedule adherence (and where appropriate
improvement) and improvements in operational availability; it will be
underpinned by a Business Transformation Plan that sets out the process
and behavioural changes required both by MOD and AgustaWestland.

###### General Munitions

### B6


###### Defi nition

B6.1 General munitions are those “simple” munitions that do not tend
to require interventionist maintenance procedures. The technology is based
primarily on energetics (explosives chemistry and mechanical engineering) and
where intervention is necessary it is simple and requires generic engineering
capability. They do not require to be managed with their parent systems


###### General Munitions

B6.6 The 105mm Improved Ammunition (IA) project is
procuring an improved High Explosive (HE) round (L50) for use with
the Light Gun. The L50 is more cost eff ective and lethal than the inservice L31 round, and has a much improved IM signature. The new
shell will use existing fuzes until the introduction of the IM TACAS F&FS
towards the end of the decade. Currently the assumed ISD is 2007.

B6.7 **4.5” Improved Ammunition (IA) is in service but not yet**
fi tted ‘fl eet-wide’ across the Royal Navy (RN). IA increases the range of
4.5” ammunition; a separate programme is investigating the potential
to move to a fully compliant IM round. A study is exploring options
for improving the capability of the RN’s medium calibre gun.

B6.8 The current OSD for CRV-7(FW) is around the end of the
decade to coincide with the projected OSD for Harrier GR7.


###### Strategic overview

B6.2 General munitions, be they Land, Sea or Air delivered,
provide an essential part of the defence arsenal. Notwithstanding
the drivers for increased accuracy and lower stockpiles, there will be
an enduring requirement for general munitions for the foreseeable
future to complement an increasing arsenal of complex weapons.


B6.3 Recent operations have clearly demonstrated that despite the
increases in technology, modern warfare, particularly on the ground,
requires highly trained and motivated service personnel to engage in
combat at a very personal level. It is in such engagements that quality
general munitions, including Small Arms Ammunition (SAA), are essential to
provide the volumes of fi re and the 24 hour, all weather capability required
to suppress, neutralise and demoralise enemy forces. Security of supply
for general munitions will therefore remain an important consideration.

###### Equipment programmes


###### B6


B6.4 The major infl uence on future general munitions programmes is
our policy on Insensitive Munitions (IM). The energetic materials that
give munitions their propulsive and destructive power also make them
susceptible to accident and combat stimuli such as heat, shock and impact. A
number of design techniques exist which can reduce munition vulnerability,
and minimise the potential collateral damage from an event. Munitions
incorporating these design features are termed IM. Under UK legislation we
have a duty to ensure, as far as reasonably practicable, that our munitions
are designed and constructed to be safe and without risk. As such, all
future munitions must be IM compliant. Where existing non-IM compliant
munitions cannot be converted, all new buys of these munitions will require
an IM Waiver. The aspiration is that by 2010 all new UK munitions will be IM,
although some legacy non-IM systems may remain in service beyond 2010.

the shelf lives of the L16 and L17 charges, which are being evaluated. A
possible Low Vulnerability (LOVA) replacement charge is being studied.
For APFSDS training, the CHARM3 Training Round (C3TR) – comprising
the inert L29A1 (shot) and the L18A1 (charge) – is used. The replacement
of the L23A1 APFSDS tungsten round, which has an OSD of 2008, by a
new tungsten round is being investigated. For the longer term, research
is ongoing to assess the option of replacing the current rifled barrel
with smoothbore. If this option were taken it is possible that, although
smoothbore ammunition is currently available off the shelf, UK would seek
to develop, potentially with overseas partners, new ammunition in order
to match emerging threats that defeat current smoothbore ammunition.

B6.12 The Next Generation Light Anti-Armour Weapon (NLAW) is
a short-range shoulder launched unguided system with broad applications
across all arms and services and will replace the capability provided by the
LAW80 weapon. The system is being developed in collaboration with Sweden,
with Saab Bofors Dynamics as prime contractor and Thales Air Defence
Ltd as the main UK subcontractor. The expected ISD is the end of 2006.

B6.13 The Anti Structures Munition (ASM) will provide the dismounted
infantry with a hand-held, shoulder launched weapon to defeat defended
structures such as buildings and bunkers. The programme is currently in a
competitive Assessment Phase between Saab Bofors Dynamics and Dynamit
Nobel Defence. Currently assumed ISD is around the end of the decade.

B6.14 A mid-life improvement (MLI) for the Shielder system, that lays the
**L35A1 anti tank mines, is scheduled for the middle of the next decade to**
extend the life to the middle of the following decade. The currently assumed
**Barmine OSD is early in the next decade, no replacement is planned.**

B6.15 There is a huge variety of explosives, pyrotechnics and
accessories, the detail of which is too diverse to cover. In addition, various
capability gaps exist or will appear due to obsolescence, age, Taggant issues
(plastic explosive tagging laws), IM compliance and other related issues.

###### Indicative planning assumptions

B6.16 Figure B6(i) illustrates our assumptions for spend in standard
accruals terms on general munitions over the next 10 years. This includes
the cost of new general munitions via the Equipment Plan (EP), the
cost of maintaining in-service general munitions within the Short Term
Plan (STP) and the planned research funding to identify and develop
h l i h EP Th UK i lik l d d


£65M on general munitions next year across these three funding
streams. The graph does not show spend on stock purchases which for
FY04/05 amounted to approximately £208M. This is excluded from the
graph in order to maintain consistency across all chapters. The total
spend on general munitions is expected to remain broadly constant
over the next ten years, and a general shift in balance from EP to STP
spend as systems currently under development are delivered. We will
continue to focus on developing new technical solutions, including IM
technology, whilst maintaining and improving our existing capability.

###### Munitions Vision – To achieve a defi ned military capability, when and where it is needed, at minimum whole-life cost, whilst ensuring intrinsic safety

 What is required for retention within the UK industrial base?

B6.17 In order to deliver the munitions vision and to determine
what should be retained onshore, the key is to ensure a sustainable
and secure supply that provides best value for money.

**System design**

B6.18 It is essential that we retain onshore the Design Authority (DA)
role and its underpinning capability for munitions manufactured in the
UK. From a national security perspective, dependency on another nation
for this may aff ect our ability to follow a preferred strategy, due to the
provider nation having diff erent strategic goals. We also require the
ability to develop munitions for specifi c purposes to match our doctrine
where it is not refl ected by other nations. We need to maintain onshore
an intelligent customer capability for non-UK designed munitions.

B6.19 We are a proven world leader in the fi eld of IM and related
energetic materials such as Polymer Bonded Explosives (PBX) and
Low Vulnerability (LOVA) propellants. The maintenance of these
capabilities in the UK can provide us with the ability to infl uence in cooperative/collaborative procurement through technology sharing.

**S** **t** **d** **l** **t**


-----

B6.20 We require little system development capability to be retained
onshore in the UK. However, it is important that a UK-based platform
system integration and system interface capability exists in order to ensure
safe operation of any UK produced munition with the delivery system.
**System manufacture**

B6.21 We intend to reduce dependence on large munitions stockpiles
through increased surge production, where technically possible and
operationally viable and providing demonstrable value for money. As
such, we wish to retain a substantive and fl exible fi ll, assemble and pack
capability onshore as well as a specialist steels and forging capability
subject to this proving value for money. However, we do not consider
it necessary to retain all aspects of bulk explosives manufacture in UK,
though we want to retain PBX manufacture and casting. The position on
SAA manufacture is less clear cut. It is desirable to retain SAA manufacture
onshore, but not at any cost. We buy in the region of 120M rounds of SAA
per annum. If off shore supply could be guaranteed there would be no need
for onshore manufacture, but this would constrain the scope for supply
chain compression and surge manufacture of a high volume product.

B6.22 In order to surge manufacture in general, and from a reduced onshore
presence in particular, industry must ensure strong supply chain management.
Furthermore, the surge manufacturing capability must be suffi ciently robust
to assure concurrent surge production across the required range of munitions.


eff ect of the post cold war peace dividend. This has resulted in the declining
volume of requirements, falling R&D funding, considerable industrial
consolidation and loss of domestic competition. For the main market players,
choices have had to be made whether to exit the market, diversify and/or
develop a long-term relationship with their nation state governments.

**_HMS ST ALBANS fi ring 4.5” Gun._**


###### B6


**Maintaining system capability through-life**

B6.23 A robust through-life management capability onshore is vital. This
includes surge production, munitions technical management, storage capability
and intrinsic safety, duty of care and legal compliance activities. It is also essential
that we retain a proof and surveillance capability onshore for UK designed
munitions as well as at least a minimum munitions disposals capability.


B6.26 Of particular importance to us is the capacity of the global market for
security of supply. We see this most with the current global drain on the SAA market.
The world market demand for SAA is estimated to be in the order of 5.2 billion
rounds per annum. Following a period of decline since the mid 1990s consumption
is rising, largely driven by the USA and also, to a lesser extent, by the UK. To fulfi l its
requirements the US is believed to be adding to its core SAA production, in order
to retain surge capacity under US control. This suggests that US is not prepared
to take the ultimate supply risk to operations; the UK has similar concerns.

B6.27 Figure B6(ii) shows the top 13 suppliers of general munitions, and
support to general munitions during FY 04/05, a simplifi ed breakdown of
the products and support services provided by these suppliers is shown
in the accompanying table. As can be seen, BAE Systems Land Systems,
under the terms of the Framework Partnering Agreement (FPA),
supply the majority of our repeat buys of existing general munitions,
achieving approximately 80% of the total value in FY04/05.


**Test and evaluation**

B6.24 A UK-based Integrated Test and Evaluation capability is essential
for quality assurance and some safety and operational security needs[1].
We do not consider it essential to carry out the testing onshore, yet
it is vital that we retain the capability to understand, interpret and
direct the testing to meet our performance and safety standards.

B6.28 The remaining 20% is subject to a healthy competitive

B6.29 An example of healthy competition is the recent contract
for supply of the Rocket Hand Fired Para Illum between PW Defence
(UK), Rheinmetall (Germany) and others (who did not meet the
User Statement of Requirement). Both PW Defence and Rheinmetall
products were tested and the Rhinemetall product was chosen.

B6.30 Currently we retain in-house the through-life management of the
munitions stockpile, including the management of disposal contracts. Storage, stock
maintenance and distribution of munitions are also carried out by our personnel.

###### Sustainment strategy

**The present**

B6.31 The FPA was signed in 1999 and is a long term arrangement between
us and RO Defence (now part of BAE Systems Land Systems). Under the
terms of the agreement we will procure repeat buys of general munitions
from BAE Systems Land Systems until 2010, on the assumption that the
arrangement continues to represent best for value for money. The FPA has
proved successful and continues to provide benefi ts for both parties.

B6.32 The FPA ensures that the UK maintains a strategically important
sustainable and secure onshore industrial capability to deliver much of our general
munitions requirement. It has been successful at achieving a long term value for
money agreement. It secured products at fi xed prices, resulting in a signifi cant
return on our initial investment and minimises the cost and risk of re-supply.

B6.33 The introduction of the FPA rationalised BAE Systems Land Systems
munitions business and avoided the costs of any closures. Further, the formal
alignment with us has supported investment in new technologies and products such
as IM, whilst the formal adoption of gainshare mechanisms has created a culture

B6.34 However, there are still recognised weaknesses to the current
FPA as it does not adequately incentivise BAE Systems Land Systems to
reduce its cost base and encourages the manufacture of product rather the
provision of service. Signifi cant eff ort has therefore gone into exploring
alternative methods to improve the current arrangements, whilst continuing
to emphasise the need for security of supply and value for money.

**Partnering principles**


B6.42 MASS is addressing all elements of the supply chain. It will include
analysis of the potential benefi ts of industry delivering munitions directly to
training areas, thus reducing the supply chain buff er stock and the associated
cost footprint. It is also considering the case for reducing war stockpiles,
replacing these with a wider surge capability, though we will not make any
hasty judgements about moves in this area unless the operational implications
are well understood and acceptable. Any changes which have implications for
our staff will be subject to consultation with the Trade Unions in the usual way.

B6.43 MASS also seeks to address the perceived weaknesses of the FPA
and to better incentivise our industrial partner to rationalise and reduce its
cost base, whilst also addressing the potential of moving further towards
capability based contracting via the vertical integration of the supply chain.
Importantly, any MASS solution would underpin security of supply for general
munitions, and value for money will be a key determinant. The options
being assessed include non-BAE Systems Land Systems supply options.


B6.35 As a result of a capability analysis and building on the existing
FPA, a partnering principles document was signed between us and
BAE Systems Land Systems on 28 September 2005. The aim of the
partnering principles was to reaffi rm the strategic partnering intent
in order to ensure long term security of supply, and incentivise BAE
Systems Land Systems capital investment and rationalisation.

B6.36 Following a strategic review, and in line with the partnering
principles, BAE Systems Land Systems therefore decided to reconfi gure
their general munitions business in the UK. This has resulted in plans to
drive greater effi ciencies in the BAE Systems Land Systems cost base whilst
reinvesting to provide the capability in a more cost eff ective manner;
this was announced publicly in October 2005. These plans are intended
to provide secure, value for money supply of general munitions.


**Relationship with other suppliers**

B6.37 About 20% of general munitions are provided by other suppliers.
These may be niche capabilities, low volume products, or simply provide
better value for money. There are 75 extant contracts to a value of £200M.


###### B6


B6.38 In the current fi nancial year our largest non-BAE Systems supplier
is PW Defence who provide a variety of pyrotechnic materials. We have a
formal partnering agreement with the company based on the principles of
the FPA with BAE Systems Land Systems. The largest non-UK based supplier
is Rheinmetall, and we also have a formal partnering agreement with them.
Partnering has encouraged strong working relationships with both companies.

B6.39 We have also created innovative contracting arrangements with
the major suppliers of air countermeasures, Wallop Defence Systems and
Chemring Countermeasures. These are designed to provide capability, and
both companies are committed to providing a signifi cant number of stores
at 24 hours notice to meet surge requirements. The Wallops Defence Systems
agreement has already matured into a formal partnering agreement.


###### The way ahead

B6.45 We need to take forward Project MASS, with a view to making
**decisions on how best to sustain our required access to general**
**munitions in the summer of next year, building on the joint working**
arrangement enshrined in the existing FPA as reinforces by the recently
agreed MOD/BAE Systems Land Systems partnering principles. We are
also actively pursuing partnering arrangements with other suppliers.


**_Members of A Company Mortar Platoon, 1st Battalion, The_**
**_Parachute Regiment, embed their 81mm mortars into position_**
**_as they prepare a defensive position outside Basra._**

B6.44 The 20% of items not provided by BAE Systems Land Systems may fall
within the scope of MASS, depending on which option demonstrates the best
value for money and maintains our general munitions capability. If the MASS
option selected does not cover these items, then we are likely to investigate
further enhancements to our other partnering agreements by widening
their scope, and continuing to seek innovative contracting arrangements.


B6.40 Other suppliers provide niche capabilities and
specialist natures for a variety of roles and customers.

**The future**

B6.41 **Project MASS (Munitions Acquisition – the Supply**
Solution), currently in its Assessment Phase, is a major MOD project
intended to build upon the existing FPA with a view to securing,
for the long term, an agreement that delivers best value for money
to the taxpayer, and a sustainable way forward for industry.


###### MASS is expected to emulate the success of the FPA and maintain a key strategic onshore industrial capability.

###### Complex Weapons
### B7


###### Defi nition

B7.1 Complex weapons are defi ned as strategic and tactical
weapons reliant upon guidance systems to achieve precision eff ects.
Tactical complex weapons fall largely into fi ve categories: Air-to-Air; Air
Defence; Air to Surface, Anti-Ship/Submarine (including Torpedoes); and
Surface to Surface. In addition to conventional weapons the chapter
also takes account of precision eff ects delivered by directed energy.

**_Vertically lauched Seawolf missile being fi red_**
**_from a Royal Navy Type 23 Frigate._**

###### Strategic overview

B7.2 Complex weapons provide the UK Armed Forces with battle winning
precision eff ects, which are able to achieve military advantage at a reduced
level of asset use. The UK has over the past 10 years made a signifi cant
investment in the upgrade and development of complex weapons for the
Armed Forces. This investment will peak at just over £1 billion next year for
the delivery, research and support for complex weapons, and has allowed
the UK both to develop a world class industrial capability, attract investment
from the US and Europe and to deploy a relatively small number of highly
capable high-value assets to meet military objectives. These assets need
to be survivable and capable of extreme accuracy, ensuring that targets are
eff ectively neutralised with the minimum of collateral damage and at the
lowest risk to our own people. In order to maintain our military advantage
the UK needs to exploit further complex cutting edge technologies such as
directed energy to ensure that we have the capability to evolve our weapons
to meet new and increasingly irregular threats. The threat environment
does not stop adapting, nor should we. In addition continued complex
weapons eff ectiveness and fl exibility will also be dependent upon thorough
integration into the emerging Network Enabled Capability (NEC).

B7.3 Complex weapons systems also underpin the maintenance
of the UK’s strategic deterrent, currently provided by the Trident
missile system deployed on the Vanguard-class submarines.

 Equipment programmes

B7.4 We have a large number of diff erent complex weapons.
Traditionally, these weapons have relied upon extensive maintenance
and storage facilities to ensure their peak eff ectiveness. Weapons
are now increasingly being designed to require little or no
maintenance.  The requirement for complex weapons processing[1]
will, however, remain integral to the delivery of operational
capability, not least due to the large quantities of legacy
weapons that will remain in service for some years to come.

**Anti-Ship and/or anti-Submarine**

B7.5 **Harpoon is currently the Royal Navy’s (RN) only long range**
anti-ship missile fi tted to both Type 23 and Type 22 Frigates. It will require
an upgrade to give increased capability against a wider irregular target
set. The assumed Out-of-service-date (OSD) is well into the 2020s.

B7.6 **Sting Ray is a lightweight anti-submarine torpedo in service and**
carried by RN (Helicopters and T23 Frigates) and the RAF (Nimrod). Stingray is
currently undergoing an upgrade; Sting Ray Mod 1 which is expected to enter
service next year. Its OSD is assumed to be until the end of the third decade.

B7.7 **Spearfi sh is a wire guided heavyweight torpedo and is the**
only anti-submarine and anti-shipping armament of the RN’s submarine
service. An replacement (Submarine Launched Underwater Weapon,
**SLUW) to this capability is being planned, including Insensitive Munition**
(IM) compliance, either based on Spearfi sh or another military-off -the-shelf
(MOTS) weapon, and is assumed to enter service early in the next decade.

**Air Defence (including maritime)**

B7.8 **Sea Dart provides area maritime air defence capability and is**
launched from T42 Destroyers; it will progressively be replaced by Principal

the introduction of Meteor for Typhoon. It will enter service in
2006 and its expected OSD is in the middle of the next decade.

B7.13 **Beyond Visual Range Air to Air Missile (BVRAAM) also known**
as Meteor is a collaborative programme between the UK and fi ve other
partner nations currently planned to enter service early in the next decade.


B7.19 **Brimstone is an advanced air-launched anti-armour**
weapon that entered service on Tornado GR4 in 2005. Brimstone
will be integrated onto Harrier GR9, and is a candidate weapon for
Typhoon. It will remain in-service until well into the 2020s.

B7.20 **Selected Precision Eff ects at Range (SPEAR) is planned**
to address the capability requirement to be able to attack fast-moving
targets at range. This programme is currently in its concept phase.


B7.21 **Future Anti-Surface (Guided Weapon)**
**FAS(GW) is planned to provide capability to attack fi xed**
coastal targets and highly manoeuvrable vessels.

**Surface-to-Surface**


**Air-to-Surface**

B7.14 **Air Launched Anti Radiation Missile (ALARM), is a**
medium-range, anti-radar, Air-to-Surface missile integrated into
the Tornado GR Mk 4. Its OSD is planned for early in the next decade.
ALARM forms part of the Suppression of Enemy Air Defence (SEAD)
capability. A variety of soft-kill options are currently being explored
in relation to the capability currently provided by ALARM.


B7.22 **Guided Multi Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) is an**
IM-compliant unitary missile. To ensure economies of scale and
logistic support benefi ts, we have chosen to co-ordinate with US
production (ratifi ed by a bilateral Memorandum of Understanding),
its expected ISD is 2007, and is assumed to remain in-service until
early in the second decade with M270 and well into the 2030s with
Lightweight Mobile Artillery Weapon System (Rocket) (LIMAWS(R)).

B7.23 **Indirect Fire Precision Attack (IFPA), this programme is intended**
to address the requirement to be able to attack static, manoeuvring and
mobile targets with precision. The capability is expected to be delivered by
an initial operating capability based largely on existing technology towards

B7.24 The Light Forces Anti-Tank Guided Weapon (LF ATGW)
is a man-portable, medium range guided anti-armour missile system,
which will provide the Infantry and Formation Reconnaissance with
the ability to defeat modern and emerging armour threats. This
requirement is being met by the US Javelin system and replaces the
Milan and Swingfi re missiles. ISD was achieved in July 2005 and the
Weapon is expected to remain in-service well into the 2020s.

**_Javelin is launched from a Pinzgauer vehicle by 42 Commando Royal_**
**_Marines during demonstration held at Imber Clump, Warminster._**

B7.25 Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) provides a land
attack capability against high value, non-hardened facilities in heavily
defended areas. The new Block IV missiles will bring additional
capability over the current Block III standard missile. They will be
carried by our attack submarine fl eet and are expected to enter
service in 2007 with an approximate OSD of at least 2040.

###### Indicative planning assumptions

B7.26 We will, on current predictions, spend over £1 billion in the
Equipment Plan on new complex weapons in FY2006/2007. The scale
of our investment in new systems is at a peak and will reduce by some
40% over the next fi ve years as production activity begins to decline
following the delivery of systems such as Storm Shadow and Brimstone.

B7.27 Given the essentially incremental nature of our planned approach to
future capability development, there is, apart from the Meteor programme,
little signifi cant planned design and development work beyond the
next two years. This will present a substantial challenge as we seek to
maintain those industrial capabilities we would wish to retain on-shore.

###### What is required for retention in the UK industrial base?

B7.28 Given the signifi cance of some types of complex weapons, in many
cases we require absolute confi dence in the performance and safety aspects
of our weapon systems, particularly as they become more sophisticated.
This can only be guaranteed if the UK has access to and a comprehensive
understanding of, the entire system and its design and controlling software.
Full access to this mission critical software and information cannot always be
secured when procuring complex weapons from off shore suppliers. While
we have procured from off shore in the past, we have balanced this risk
against the military capability aff orded by the overseas options and also
against the assumption that we could continue to rely on a sustainable UK
industrial base. This does not preclude future procurements off the shelf
or otherwise from other nations, even where our access to critical software
and information is denied. But it means recognising the risks of such
approaches, and retaining the option to avoid these through a sovereign
capability onshore, particularly for campaign-critical capabilities where there
is little competition other than from US companies, is highly desirable.

B7.29 Therefore to maintain appropriate sovereignty, it is important
that the UK can use, maintain and upgrade specifi c capabilities
in its inventory, independent of other nations. To do this, the UK
needs guaranteed access to the following key functions:

Provide weapon systems design and performance
expertise independently or as a leading player
in collaboration with other nations.

Understand threats from technology proliferation.
Exploit emerging and novel technology (outlined in
detail in the table at the end of the chapter).

Develop Counter Counter-Measures (CCM).
Respond to UORs.
Undertake national projects within the relevant
legal and international frameworks.

Retain suffi cient understanding of elements of the nuclear deterrent[2].
Through-life capability management and support
for the current weapon inventory.

B7.30 In order to deliver these key functions we need access to a UK
industrial base that, as a minimum, provides the following capabilities:

**Concepts generation, design and systems engineering**

B7.31 In order for the UK to act independently it will be critical to
retain on-shore knowledge and experience of how the weapon system
can achieve its objective against an adversary in a hostile environment.
This means we need a critical mass of expertise to develop complex
weapons concepts through synthetic environments and the ability
to design and integrate the weapon with platforms and sensors.

**Exploiting and controlling complex**
**weapons in a network environment**

B7.32 Increasingly, complex weapons will need to be networked[3] with other
systems to fully exploit their potential and to be an information provider to the
network. This will require the ability to modify the mission critical software

_2 A number of UK suppliers are involved in modelling and_
_assessment of the current Deterrent and would be involved_
_in any studies for any potential replacement._
_3 For example, the information network, mission planning, command and_
_l_ _i_ _d_ _i_ _l i_ _dl h l_ _k_

and to manage weapon and network interfaces. The capability to design the
actual guidance, control, and seeker algorithms of the weapon is therefore
vital to operational success. This capability is central to delivering rapid,
fl exible and precise military eff ects, reducing collateral damage, maintaining
the existing inventory eff ectiveness and reducing our vulnerability to
counter-measures. The UK’s ability to design, understand and/or have
access to such critical information will be a key measure of sovereignty.


**Through life support/technology insertion**

B7.36 The need to sustain the current inventory, have sovereign control
over weapon deployment and the ability to upgrade, at least for part of
the inventory, requires the retention of an onshore ability to maintain
complex weapons through design authority and through-life support
processes. This is often referred to as complex weapon processing.


**Underwater capability - Torpedoes**

The UK must retain the capability to support the current inventory
and also to write tactical software, (fusing, guidance and control
algorithms) and to design and integrate homing heads. Provided
we maintain control of these elements, we would be prepared
to buy new torpedoes designed and manufactured overseas.


**Lethal package and propulsion**

B7.33 These are the key determinants of the weapon systems performance.
These elements by their nature carry a signifi cant safety risk that requires
a range of specifi c capabilities if the UK is to be a safe owner. To improve
safe ownership; all of our new weapons will need to be IM-compliant.


**_Through life support to sidewinder © Ultra_**

###### Overview of the global defence market


###### B7


B7.34 The design of the lethal and non lethal package is
required to ensure proportional eff ects including low collateral
damage. This leads to a requirement for expert knowledge of the
conventional and novel warhead and the ability to design the safety
and arming functions to be retained in the UK industrial base.


**Directed Energy Weapons (DEW)**

We judge that Directed Energy technologies (lasers and radio
frequencies) could be highly signifi cant in the future, particularly for
protecting our Forces from a range of threats, including Improvised
Explosive Devices. They could also off er the UK non-kinetic and
/ or less-lethal options to replace, enhance or complement
traditional kinetic weapons, such as missiles, and off er signifi cant
opportunities to reduce collateral damage, notably in urban
areas. Due to the reusable nature of the technology and some of
its potential applications, there is also potential for a signifi cant
reduction in the logistic footprint and whole life costs compared
with conventional weapons. We are assessing the potential
military utility of DEW technology through a number of research
programmes. Aspects of these programmes include technology
development, user requirements and concepts of operations.


B7.37 The world missile market is dominated by two principal US
primes; Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. The largest European prime is
MBDA, a joint venture owned by BAE Systems, EADS and Finmeccanica.
Within Europe, MBDA has national representation in the UK, France
and Italy as well as a presence in Germany. The European sector is also
characterised by a series of smaller, contractors such as Thales and Saab
Bofors Dynamics that also have the capability to act as a prime contractor.

###### Overview of the UK defence market


B7.40 **Raytheon Systems Ltd is a wholly owned UK subsidiary of**
the Raytheon Company USA. It is the prime contractor for the Precision
Guided Bomb (Paveway IV) and is also a major sub-contractor with
particular capability in missile electronics, where it is an exporter to
US programmes such as AMRAAM, Tomahawk, HARM and TOW.

B7.41 Roxel UK Ltd is the UK‘s only designer and manufacturer of rocket
motors and accounts for some 60% of our requirements for rocket motors.


B7.38 In the UK the main player in the missiles sector is MBDA UK Ltd,
the prime contractor for around half of our in-service inventory and
account for over 50% of the investment currently on contract.

B7.39 **Thales Air Defence Ltd (TADL) is the prime for High**
Velocity Missile (HVM) and has had a niche capability in Short Range
Air Defence as well as Electro Optic Counter Measures (EOCM).


B7.35 We will need to support and re-life as necessary in-service
rocket motors and warheads. Some specifi c types of propulsion,
energetics technology and manufacture are unique to the UK
and in particular the UK has the lead in IM which we will need
to retain for the future safe ownership of our weapons.


B7.42 **BAE Systems Underwater Systems Ltd is the single UK**
indigenous company capable of designing, developing, supplying
and supporting in-service light and heavyweight torpedoes.

B7.43 Other companies in the UK with elements of the complex weapons
sub-system capability include Thales Missile Electronics Ltd (seekers and
fuzing), BAE Systems Land Systems Ltd (warheads), Selex UK Ltd (seekers),
**Insyte (trackers), LM (UK) Insys Ltd and QinetiQ, (intelligent customer advice,**

###### Sustainment strategy

B7.44 The UK needs to retain the capability within industry to design,
develop, assemble, support and upgrade complex weapons. Future demand
and investment will not support the UK’s current spectrum of industrial
capability in the way it is currently provided from 2007 onwards.

B7.45 The fragility of the wider UK industrial base is such that
unmitigated open international competition will put the sustainment
of key industrial capabilities at risk. We need to consider how we
ensure that our requirements can be met, by a sustainable industry in
a value for money fashion into the future. We intend to work with all
elements of the onshore industry, therefore, over the next six to twelve
months to establish whether – and if so how – this can be achieved.
This dialogue will need to be based on the following key principles:

**A tempering of competition: For the short to medium term,**
we will consider suspending the use of international competition
to meet our future complex weapons requirements (with the
exception of torpedoes). We will instead be looking at whether,
if in this period our requirements were to be directed to onshore
industry, it would be possible to meet them, secure long-term
value for money, and maintain a viable industrial base.  This
would of course be subject to the construction of a satisfactory
business case and appropriate contractual arrangements. However,
even more fundamentally, it is unlikely that the resources
currently available could sustain the industry in its current form,
and industry must play its part in meeting the challenge.

**Industrial restructuring: Given the over- capacity in the domestic**
and wider European market and the trans-national nature of the
predominant onshore industrial player, there is signifi cant potential
for industrial rationalisation and consolidation. We will, as part of
the work mentioned above, need to work closely with our European
partners to identify whether a coordinated approach to sustain a
viable industrial base is possible. But this will not be to the exclusion
of other US-owned companies, in particular those who have already
established a fi rm foothold, and, consistent with our defi nition of the
UK defence industry, are focussed on securing appropriate technology
access in the UK for us to maintain appropriate sovereignty. This
ill i b l b i ill b i


that we do not sustain overcapacity in the onshore industrial base
or act in a way that, overall, weakens the sustainability of the
capabilities and technologies to which we attach importance.

**Diff erent approaches to acquisition through-life:**
We need to explore diff erent approaches to acquisition
and support so the required level of capability can be
maintained. In addition to restructuring the industry,
including the supply chain, this will require:

an open dialogue between all parties;
working to improve arrangements for
through-life capability support;

agreed mechanisms to demonstrate
long-term value for money.

B7.46 Changing the way we do business will be challenging, for both
us and industry, given the number of companies in the sector set against
the declining workload expected on new developmental programmes.

B7.47 We also need to take into account that the UK has overcapacity
and capability when it comes to managing the maintenance, support
and storage of complex weapons. Much of this capability resides within
the Defence Logistics Organisation (DLO) Defence Munitions Centres
(DMC), which should be retained in Government ownership. It is clear
that greater integration and rationalisation of the industry and our
support capabilities could be achieved. Close MOD and industry support
relationships are also likely to enable easier technology insertion and
spiral development. Future partnering and commercial arrangements
for support are therefore being explored at both the individual project
and the strategic levels; we will be considering whether Contracting
for Availability could bring benefits to both MOD and industry. This
will be taken into consideration during the joint work with industry
over the next six to twelve months. Any changes to our current
arrangements arising from this work which impact on MOD staff would
be subject to consultation with the Trade Unions in the usual way.

B7.48 Our approach to torpedoes will largely be centred on the
outcome of the SLUW programme. We will need to consider carefully
how to sustain our world-class capability in torpedo homing head
design and integration if an overseas option is chosen to provide this
upgrade. If this situation arose, we would need to consider bringing the
capability into our research facilities to ensure continued secure access.

B7.49 **Research and Development: Research and Development**
is important to the maintenance of cutting edge technology. We will
need to develop a series of route maps to link technology exploration
to future capability and exploit the high value intellectual capital built
up through years of investment. This will need to be co-ordinated
across the complex weapons sector to remove duplication. As part
of our considerations of the best means to sustain key capabilities
and technologies, we will need to be aware of the role that
targeted Technology Demonstrator Programmes might play.

B7.50 **Looking to the future: There are obvious attractions – given the**
through-life costs of supporting the large number of diff erent weapons in
current and planned service – in examining with industry how we might
rationalise our inventory. In addition to the associated cost savings, this
might allow reductions in the overall stockpile, extend the time over which
production takes place (which could allow easier technology insertion and
smoother production throughput) and increase our fl exibility in operations.
This will require us to work closely with industry to develop technology
d d i i h b fi f b h l


-----

B7.51 The challenges in this sector are very real and the approach
we have laid out will be very demanding. We will need to work fast,
in conjunction with industry if we are to avoid seeing the UK industrial
capability going into decline. A joint MOD and UK industrial team will
be created in the immediate future to take forward this work.

###### The way ahead


B7.52 We need to establish a multi-disciplinary team charged with
**working with the onshore industry to establish how we might**
**together seek to sustain the critical guided weapons technologies**
**and through-life support capabilities that we judge to be so**
**important to our operational sovereignty. Given the trans-national**
nature of the industrial players, this dialogue will need also to engage our
allies and partners, particularly in Europe. This work will be complex and
will necessarily take time, but our intention is that we should have a clearer
way ahead by the end of 2006, with a view to informing decisions in 2007.

###### Defi nition

B8.1 C4ISTAR (Command, Control, Communication and Computers,
Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance)
comprises those capabilities, that when linked can achieve the desired
military eff ect by providing the ability to command and inform the Armed
Forces in an eff ective and coherent manner and that together form the
initial stages of Network Enabled Capability (NEC). They generate and
enable the delivery of accurate, timely and appropriate information and
intelligence products to decision-makers at all levels in national and coalition
operations. The capability area can be sub-divided into two components;
Command, Control & Information Infrastructure (CCII) and ISTAR. The C4
component of CCII provides optimised and integrated Command and Battle
Management (CBM) and Global Information Infrastructure equipment
capabilities. The ISTAR component constitutes a combination of sensors,
weapons systems, IT hardware & software, people and processes that
collectively enable the ISTAR cycle (Direct, Collect, Process & Disseminate).
The technologies associated with these capabilities are often leading edge,
draw extensively on research activities, exploit developments in the civil
sector, and place a premium on innovation, rapid technology insertion
and eff ective system integration[1].  It is this sector that the principle of
spiral development to enable continued operational performance is
most relevant given the rapid pace of technological development.

###### Strategic overview

B8.2 The 2004 White Paper ‘Delivering Security in a Changing World:
Future Capabilities’ stated that the continued transformation of UK forces
is dependent on exploiting the benefi t of NEC. It also noted that NEC, by
enabling ‘the ability to respond more quickly and precisely, will act as a
force multiplier enabling our forces to achieve the desired eff ect through a
smaller number of more capable assets.’ NEC is one of our highest priorities
for future investment in research, acquisition, people and training. The
delivery strategy focuses on three Epochs: Initial State, achieved by 2009 and
characterised by interconnection; Transitional State, achieved by the middle
of the next decade and characterised by integration, and Mature State, with
an aim of achievement by the middle of the second decade onwards and

_[1] Given the large number of defence capabilities that have some C4ISTAR_
_functionality as a second or lower order function of the system in which they_
_reside e.g. platform mission and command systems, weapon locating and_
_guidance radars; navigation and aircraft defensive aids, and in order to establish_
_a manageable boundary for this Chapter, the above Defi nition of C4ISTAR has_
_been interpreted in a relatively literal sense. Thus, in considering future defence_
_capability demand and associated industrial and technological capabilities,_
_the analysis concentrates on those systems and applications whose core_
_function is to Command and Inform the Armed Forces as defi ned above. These_
_are principally the defence capabilities for which requirements are set by the_
_Equipment Customers Directorates CCII and ISTAR. In consequence, some of_
_the industrial and technological capabilities identifi ed will have relevance to_
_defence capabilities discussed in other Chapters and vice versa. In a similar vein,_
_business information system applications supporting functions such as defence_
_logistics and personnel or medical services are addressed only superfi cially,_
_on the basis that enabling technologies and industrial capabilities import_
_principally from the civil commercial sector, the larger customer base for which_
_illd i_ _i_ _i_ _df_ _i_ _li_ _h d f_ _li_ _i_ _l i_


characterised by synchronisation. However, the pace of change is such that
the delivery strategy must continue to evolve as further opportunities for NEC
delivery present themselves in accordance with technological innovation.

B8.3 It will be the C4ISTAR related capabilities that will help underpin
the overarching NEC capability by providing the technology to enable
agile, networked and informed armed forces.  There is thus an enduring
requirement for some industrial and technological capabilities across
the spectrum of acquisition from system design to maintenance of
the capability, and for systems integration, system engineering and
information assurance skills. In considering the industrial base from which
future C4ISTAR capabilities can be derived, we must also look beyond our
current providers to other sectors, from mobile phone providers to fi lm
studios, who may be able to off er innovative applications or derivations
of non-military technologies in support of the desired capability.

**_High Level Network Map._**

B8.4 The increasing incidence of asymmetric operations in diffi cult
environments (including the urban) against irregular forces and individuals
who are increasingly aware of our ISTAR capabilities is driving a requirement
for increasingly detailed, unambiguous, persistent and timely information.
At the same time, peace enforcement and peace keeping operations
require persistent surveillance in a more benign environment.

B8.5 It is assumed that the longstanding strategic relationship with
the US will continue for the foreseeable future. In particular, with respect
to ISTAR, it is assumed that access to US research and industrial capabilities
will continue on a similar footing, albeit we are operating with continued
uncertainty regarding current and future access to US technology.

###### Equipment programmes

B8.6 There are a variety of programmes that are either in initial
planning stages, are due to enter service soon or have recently entered
service that provide capability over three principal areas; Command
**and Battlespace Management, the Network and ISTAR.**

B8.7 **Command and Battlespace Management are**
programmes that are envisaged to provide commanders
with the data and information that they need.


-----

B8.8 **Platform Battlefi eld Information Systems Application**
**(P-BISA), which is a part of the wider ComBAT, Infrastructure and**
**P-BISA (CIP) programme, will provide hardware and software to enable**
armoured vehicle commanders to send and receive information over the
Bowman tactical internet. It will provide secure voice and data messaging,
situational awareness and operational planning tools. As part of the
Bowman programme the contract for P-BISA was awarded to General
Dynamics (UK). Just over 1000 systems will be delivered to equip Warrior,
Challenger 2 and Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance Tracked (CVRT) Scimitar.

B8.9 **Land Environment Air Picture Provision (LEAPP), is**
envisaged to provide a near-real time correlated air picture for the land
environment world-wide, either alone or as an element of integrated
air defence, to enable a graduated and enduring contribution to the
NEC community in national and multi-national operations in a multithreat environment. It is currently in its assessment phase.


process, situational awareness, planning, synchronisation and information
management. Full delivery is envisaged in the latter half of this decade.

B8.15 The UK Air Surveillance, Command and Control System
**(UKASCACS) project is intended to investigate options to provide an integrated**
Air C2 system capable of planning, tasking and executing operational level
through to tactical level, air battle management and surveillance in the UK.


B8.10 **J2CSP is the Joint Command and Control Support Programme.**
It will develop a command support application hosted on the Defence
Information Infrastructure (DII) that bring together three existing systems,
(RNCSS, RAFCIS and JOCS) and extends functionality. This complex programme
has four constituent parts all of which are in the Concept or Assessment phase.

B8.11 The Deployable Air Traffi c Control Capability Enhancement
**(DATCCE) programme aims to increase our DATC capability to enable**
simultaneous support to an additional two bare Deployed Operating
Base locations. It will allow air traffi c controllers to provide a full
instrument fl ight rules service, 24 hours a day in all weathers, to
enable military aircraft to operate safely from a number of austere
and bare base operating locations as part of JRRF operations.


B8.16 **Future Integrated Soldier Technology (FIST) will enhance**
the ability of the dismounted infantry to move, fi nd and engage the
enemy. It will provide an integrated suite of capabilities adjusted
for the soldier’s role including improved protection, day and night
surveillance and target acquisition and assistance with navigation,
command and control and battle preparation. The programme is
currently in an Assessment Phase which is supported by Thales, and
is envisaged to come into service around the turn of the decade.

B8.17 **Network programmes are designed to facilitate**
the rapid and secure communication of data:


B8.18 **Bowman is providing the Armed Forces with a tactical**
communications system for all three services in support of land
and littoral operations. In addition to secure voice communications
there are a set of common software tools that will enhance
situational awareness at all levels and aid planning for, and control
of, operations. General Dynamics (UK) are delivering this project.
Bowman is likely to remain in-service well into the 2020s.

**_Bowman is the UK’s tactical communications system,_**
**_providing data and voice communications and a satellite-_**
**_precision navigation to the front line for all 3 services._**


###### B8


B8.12 A hierarchy of logistic capabilities are being developed to deliver
a Joint Logistic Picture to provide the necessary decision support to Logistic
commanders at all levels in the deployed force, and asset tracking endto-end throughout the Joint Support Chain. These include JC2SP, as well
as ‘transactional’ systems: Management of the Joint Deployed Inventory
(MJDI), Joint Asset Management and Engineering Solutions (JAMES) and
Management of Materials in Transit (MMIT). The transactional systems will
grow incrementally to encompass all defence assets and commodities:

MJDI will provide inventory management and the auditable
account for all material held in Defence outside the Base Depots.


MMIT will provide a management information layer above asset
tracking systems in order to manage supply chain operations.


JAMES will deliver engineering and asset management
of all equipment and key equipment components across
defence, including the management information system to
support Whole Fleet Management and the exploitation of
HUMS capability delivered through platform projects.

B8.13 The Joint Military Air Traffi c Services (JMATS) programme
aims to provide the next generation of military terminal air traffi c
control services. It will support operations involving all three services at
frontline airfi elds, training airfi elds, ranges and contracted airfi elds.


B8.14 As the framework nation for HQ Allied Rapid Reaction Corps,
the UK is required to provide Command Intelligence Systems (CIS) for
the headquarters on operations, part of which is the Command Support
System.  The ARRC Command and Control Information System
**(ARRC C2IS) will comprise applications (and associated infrastructure) that**

B8.19 **Skynet 5 is delivering the next generation of military**
satellite communications and will, incrementally, replace the Skynet
4 ground and space segment. Skynet 5 is being procured as a Private
Finance Initiative (PFI) and its boundary has been extended to include
Maritime and Land terminals making the commercial partner, Paradigm,
responsible for the end to end delivery of satellite communications
services. Capability from Skynet 5 is already being made available for
the Armed Forces and should have a service life of at least 20 years.

B8.20 **Cormorant is a new capability, that has recently entered service,**
designed to meet the needs of the Joint Rapid Reaction Force (JRRF). It
provides communications within and between the deployed Headquarters
of the Joint Force. A high capacity, secure communications system,

be fully interoperable with other UK communications systems such as
Ptarmigan, Bowman and Skynet 5 and allows communications between
UK and Allied headquarters. EADS UK Ltd is delivering this capability.

B8.21 The Defence HF Communications Service (DHFCS)
provides a coherent solution to the defence strategic High Frequency
(HF) communications requirement until the end of the decade. It is
bringing the disparate maritime and air systems together under a single
service provision that will also capture the HF facilities in the overseas
commands. The service provider is responsible for both the technical
solution and the provision of HF services and is expected to introduce new
services and improved technology on an incremental basis throughout
the programme. It is expected that the new service will deliver a step
change in data throughput, improved reliability through the exploitation
of new automated processes and a reduction in manpower required to
operate the system. The DHFCS contractor is VT Communication.

B8.22 **General Key Management (GKM) has recently entered service and**
is a tri-service project to replace the current manual distribution of un-encrypted,
hard copy material, with a computer controlled system, which will manage
and distribute encrypted key material stored on magnetic media. Currently
all Communication Security material (key variable, cryptographic equipment
and publications) is managed by the use of manpower intensive hand written
records. A manual system will not be able to handle the predicted increase
in key material. GKM will manage the existing physical material for some of
our high grade cryptography products. The GKM contractor is EADS UK Ltd.

B8.23 The RNJTIDS/STDL project will provide a secure, ElectroMagnetic Capability resistant, high capacity, digital Tactical Data Link
capability (Link 16), to the Royal Navy and is about to come into service.
This capability will overcome the critical limitations of Link 11 for the
exchange of near real time tactical information in the line of sight
domain, and will maintain interoperability with Allies. The related STDL
(Secure Tactical Data Link) programme (now merged into RNJTIDS),
approved in the mid 1990s, extends use of the same L16 messages
incorporated into command systems under the RNJTIDS programme, to
Beyond Line Of Sight via UK Super High Frequency satellite bearers.

B8.24 **FALCON is intended to provide a tactical formation level**
secure trunk communications system for the UK and the Allied Rapid
Reaction Corps (ARRC). It is planned to replace the capability provided
by Ptarmigan, RTTS/DLAN and EUROMUX. FALCON should contribute to
the ‘Resilient Information Infrastructure’ theme of NEC by providing the
modern, secure communications infrastructure required by deployed
formations and operating bases, such as Bowman and Cormorant.

B8.25 **Computer Network Defence is planned to provide an ongoing**
capability to protect our network above existing defensive measures. It will
consist of an integrated set of mechanisms, processes and organisations, and
an eff ective command structure, which together will maintain our capability to
defend our Information Systems (IS) from attempts to disrupt or disable them.

B8.26 **Physical Infrastructure for Deployable Headquarters will**
provide environmentally protected and appropriately deployable physical
infrastructure for dismounted headquarters and communication nodes,
in order to ensure that off the shelf C4I equipments do not fail in harsh
environments. The capability will enter service around the turn of the decade.

B8.27 **The Defence Information Infrastructure (DII) will provide a**
networked IS infrastructure, at all classifi cations and caveats of information,
to all non-deployed units and headquarters and certain deployed elements.

B8.28 **The Defence Fixed Telecommunications System (DFTS)**
provides our voice and data fi xed telecommunications services.  This is
currently being delivered through a 15 year Public Private Partnership (PPP)
deal signed with British Telecom in 1997 and extended until 2012 this year.

B8.29 Project ANSON is envisaged to provide defence users, outside
the battlespace, with an effi cient high grade messaging capability
to exchange the correct information, with the correct people, at the
correct time, in the correct format and in a legally accountable manner.
It is planned to complement the medium grade messaging capability
and will be delivered as part of DII, in the latter half of this decade.

B8.30 The Joint Network Integration Body (JNIB) is a joint MOD/
Industry body empowered to intervene and deliver solutions to integration
problems between component joint planning networks. JNIB is being
delivered using a combination of existing MOD resources and directly
contracted industry resource from the key companies concerned.

B8.31 In addition, we also invest in bodies such as the Integration
**Authority (IA) which works towards the integration of information**
and projects across the whole battlespace in order to enhance military
capability in the conduct of joint and combined operations.

B8.32 **ISTAR programmes planned to facilitate the processes**
needed to acquire and analyse data for the Armed Forces:

B8.33 The Airborne Stand Off Radar system (ASTOR) will give our
Armed Forces an entirely new capability, providing commanders with
accurate and timely ground surveillance information in a wide range of
scenarios, from humanitarian aid to combat operations. As a key element
in our future mix of sensor assets, ASTOR will play a signifi cant role in our
eff orts to develop NEC. ASTOR is being developed by Raytheon Systems
Ltd. The fi ve ASTOR air platforms, based on a modifi ed Bombardier
Global Express aircraft, will be known as the Sentinel R Mk 1. They are
currently expected to begin to enter service from the end of 2006.

B8.34 **SOOTHSAYER incorporates some of the world’s most advanced**
electronic warfare (EW) equipment. The system will comprise both electronic
support measures and electronic counter measures (ECM). It will be fi tted to
high mobility light role and armoured vehicles and will be fully integrated in to
the digitised land battlespace and be interoperable with other EW systems in
joint operations. Lockheed Martin Systems Integration was selected as prime
contractor in 2003, following a three year competitive assessment phase.
SOOTHSAYER equipment will start to enter service towards the end of the decade.


B8.40 The Maritime Airborne Surveillance and Control (MASC) programme,
aims to provide an assured airborne surveillance and control capability,
forms the third element of the Carrier Strike capability, alongside the Joint
Combat Aircraft and Future Carrier. It is envisaged to continue the capability
currently aff orded by the Sea King Mk 7 Airborne Surveillance and Control
variant. MASC should provide a capability for surveillance of the air and
surface as well as battle management of air defence fi ghters and other
assets. The MASC programme is currently in the Assessment Phase.

B8.41 Established after publication of the Strategic Defence Review New
Chapter, the DABINETT programme seeks to fi ll the challenging ISTAR
capability gaps resulting from the changing threat. Focused on persistent ISTAR
collection in the deep battlespace, the capability envisaged will be used to
gather and disseminate strategic, operational and tactical intelligence, answer
commanders’ requests for information, and provide targeting information
to systems in all environments. DABINETT will comprise a system of systems
intended to enable persistent collection, processing and dissemination
of near real time ISTAR data in the deep battlespace. A contract has been
placed with LogicaCMG to undertake the role of DABINETT Development
and Support Contractor (DDASC). This will support the Concept phase of the
programme, establishing requirements and reaching a view on potential
solutions, which are likely to roll out incrementally over the next two decades.


B8.35 **SHAMAN intends to use Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS),**
open architecture systems to provide the capability for communication
electronic support measures to Royal Navy warships. A UK/US industry
team led by BAE Systems Insyte was selected in early 2005 as the
preferred contractor for an Advanced Demonstration phase for the
project, aiming to mature and de-risk the SHAMAN solution

B8.36 The WATCHKEEPER tactical Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
system will provide UK commanders with accurate, timely and high quality
information, including imagery. WATCHKEEPER will be fully integrated
into the wider command and control digitised network passing data
quickly to those that need it. The capability is being developed by Thales
UK and will begin to deliver capability from the end of the decade.


###### Illustrative planning assumptions

B8.42 We expect to spend in the region of £2BN to £2.5BN per annum in
this sector over the next ten years. Figure B8(i) shows the Short Term Plan
(STP) resource associated with the support of current in-service equipments
and those that will enter service over the period. It also includes the resource
associated with some service provision projects that are entirely funded from
the STP. The fi gure does not diff erentiate between these two STP components.

B8.37 Project EAGLE will provide an upgrade to the capability currently
provided by the Sentry E-3D aircraft to enable it to carry out additional duties
commensurate with an AWACS, such as control of aircraft and management of
the air battle. The AWACS capability is critical in the successful prosecution of
the air battle. This upgrade is required to bring the UK capability into line with
NATO and US E-3 variants. The project is currently in the Assessment Phase.

B8.43 In support of the forward programme of capabilities, the
ability to design and manufacture equipment does not generally
need to reside in the UK. However, there is a need to develop a cadre
of system engineering skills to enable industry to understand our
systems and in particular be able to support them through-life.

B8.44 In terms of specifi c capabilities for which a measure of sovereign
control is required, information assurance and cryptographic systems

support capability. A sustainment strategy must be developed in concert
with other Government departments and is linked to current crossGovernment information assurance (including cryptographic) studies.

B8.45 In other capability areas, the sovereign ability to design,
demonstrate and perhaps build advanced systems may be advantageous
to foster a balanced relationship with other nations. National capability
in cryptographic systems, network integration and the design, build and
operation of satellites, particularly small satellites, are examples of worldleading niche capabilities that may help to provide such leverage.

B8.46 More generally, across the C4ISTAR capability
the UK needs to retain suffi cient expertise to:

understand capability requirements;
develop user and system requirements;
architect and maintain complex networks and communications
with the ability to interoperate with a wide range of
potential partners in support of operations;

architect an overall system;
assess the global marketplace;
conduct research into areas that cannot be provided
cost-eff ectively by the global marketplace;

pull through successful research into in-service systems;
test and evaluate systems;
support within the UK equipment through life
– including modifi cation and technology insertion to
facilitate upgrades and obsolescence management;
maintain custody and the integrity of the increasing
quantity of national military and intelligence data.

B8.47 In terms of technologies there are a number in which C4ISTAR are
dependent, and in which there may, case by case, be a need for targeted
investment to ensure a continued understanding of emerging developments
or to have assurance regarding their security of supply. These include:

Antennas Multilevel Security

Architectures Nuclear C2

Combat ID Radiation Hardening

Data Fusion Radio Frequency (RF) integration
and Electro Magnetic Capability

Digital Networks Satellite Technology

Electro-optic/Infra-Red Imaging Synthetic Aperture Radar

Electronic Counter Measures and Tactical Data Links
Electronic Counter Counter Measures

Electronic Support Measures Sortware Defi ned Radios

Extra High Frequency Digital Signal Processing
satellite communications

High Integrity and Safety Critical Computing

Wideband High Power Amplifi ers

###### Overview of the current UK defence market

B8.48 The C4ISTAR industrial sector is in good health. There is the potential
for eff ective competition between onshore and off shore suppliers. Many of the
companies within the sector have a strong presence in other markets, defencerelated and civil, the latter providing opportunities for technologies to spin
in to defence or to be exploited or further developed in support of exclusively
d f d d A h i l l i h f ll i


companies as particularly visible players at both Group and Division levels:

**BAE Systems** **Thales**
**EADS** **General Dynamics**
**Lockheed Martin** **Northrop Grumman**
**Raytheon** **Selex Communications**
**VT Communications** **Ultra Electronics**
**BT** **EDS**
**Fujitsu** **LogicaCMG**
**QinetiQ**

B8.49 At the sub-system level, the supply base is spread across a
number of smaller enterprises as well as within the large primes, and
often reaching into the commercial sector within the UK and overseas.
Sourcing strategies refl ect the general pattern of global supply and value
chains exhibited across all high technology sectors. There is an increasing
opportunity to develop innovative capability solutions across the supply
chain from within traditional sub-system providers as well as those who
may not necessarily consider themselves potential defence suppliers, for
example mobile-phone data package providers or the biometrics industry.

**_Artist’s impression of Skynet5._**

B8.50 US investment and US companies dominate the world defence market
and as the above list demonstrates, several of those US defence companies
have made a substantial investment in a UK presence, attracted by the business
opportunities and openness of the UK market. However, the larger US defence
investment may create an imbalance in favour of US technologies in some
important fi elds presenting a further challenge for sustainment, in particular
regarding diffi culties about technology transfer. Areas where the UK market
presence has diminished in relative terms include EW and tactical communications.

B8.51 The wider civil market may off er a counter-balance for the future
and provides signifi cant potential for further innovation and competition.
For example, the European mobile communications industry has highly
developed digital networks and is a world leader. Civil IS providers have
signifi cant experience in the creation of secure and reliable networks which
could have potential application in the military environment. Additionally,
the ability of military personnel to rapidly absorb and act upon a wealth of
information demands particular cognitive capabilities that could be provided
by a variety of civil industry, which we may not have previously considered
in depth such as fi lm studios and computer console manufacturers who
have signifi cant experience and success in the wider cognitive fi eld.

B8.52 The consensus of analysis of trends in defence expenditure is
that C4ISTAR is a growing market. Factors driving this growth include:

the massive market in electronic systems and software
for domestic, commercial and entertainment purposes
has created both the expectation and industrial

development of new technologies, for example synthetic

carry ISTAR capabilities (e.g. on medium and large UAVs);

application of commercial technologies. This is particularly true
in the communications and ‘personal devices’ sectors, which have
provided the technical basis for small radios, Global Positioning
System (GPS) etc. Business tools, such as offi ce automation, are
also being used to support operations in a wide range of systems;


###### Sustainment strategy

B8.54 We require to have available to defence a comprehensive
understanding of rapidly developing technologies and the ability to exploit
these in conjunction with existing systems, with which they must interoperate.
We have identifi ed four areas of industrial capability within the C4ISTAR sector
that are essential for the maintenance of UK operational sovereignty. These are:


there is rapid obsolescence which presents particular challenges
and business opportunities for sub-systems that must be integrated
into platforms with much longer life cycles. At its most extreme,
this discontinuity of cycle can be seen in new platforms entering
service with software and processors that are already at the margins
of obsolescence. Therefore, management of spares and stocks
will be critical to ensure these IS capabilities can continue to be
serviced and updated throughout a potentially long service-life;

doctrinal developments, such as the change in military
structures from static to rapidly deployable and highly
mobile forces that are fl exibly ‘networked’;


high grade cryptography and associated
information assurance capabilities;

a continued ability to understand, integrate, assure
and modify mission critical systems;


a continued ability (for both us and industry) to act as
an intelligent customer, in particular to track emerging
technologies for potential military application;


assimilation and dissemination of time-critical information
to identify enemy forces and strike before concealment
or withdrawal. This drives increased demand for sensor
platforms capable of long-persistence and with the
ability to relay information back to C2 systems;

demand for greater interoperability with a ‘coalition of the willing’,
which could include partners we have yet to undertake operations
with. Lessons learned from Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq have led to a
re-evaluation of requirements based on the need for interoperability
with allied forces. Adoption of common standards within allied
communication networks would facilitate greater interoperability,
particular coupled with the use of Commercial-off -the-Shelf (COTS)
products, where appropriate, amongst likely coalition partners;


a sustained research and development base (attracting the
right calibre of individuals with the right skills) supported by a
manufacturing capability in specifi c areas of defence technology.

B8.55 Of these, only maintaining a cryptographic capability currently
requires a strategy to sustain an end-to-end design, development
and manufacturing capability. This derives from a need for the design,
development and production teams to be comprised of UK Nationals,
and in part because there are limited commercial opportunities for
this technology. The maintenance of other C4ISTAR capabilities resides
currently within a relatively strong set of industrial primes supported by a
diverse supply chain. Of these, companies with a commercial, as opposed
to those with a traditional defence sector background are increasingly
off ering themselves as players in the system engineering arena.


B8.56 But we must also change the way we present our requirements to, and
interact with, the market. The relative strength of the C4ISTAR industrial base
and the complementary technology acceleration within the commercial sector
are opportunities which we intend to exploit in support of our drive towards NEC.

**High grade cryptography**


###### B8


budgetary pressure to leverage additional capability from existing
platforms and to upgrade existing C4ISTAR equipment;


B8.57 Although the market for high grade cryptography is low in
volume compared with the commercial sector’s lower grade cryptography
needs, it remains strategically vital across Government. Protection of
high grade information for MOD and wider Government requires a UK
sovereign capability to control those aspects of cryptographic production
and support critical to the integrity of the product and protection of
issues such as national security. The broader benefi ts of inclusion and
access to developments in the wider cryptographic community (in this
case predominantly the US) will also be pursued. In terms of quantity, we
represent the major customer for high grade encryption within Government,
and as such have a signifi cant role to play in shaping the grade and type of
cryptography off ered by industry in the future. However, our interaction
with the market is not aided by the fact that the Government’s demand
for cryptography is currently fragmented, thus depriving industry of
an aggregated basis which to develop a sustainable business plan.

B8.58 Work, supported by us, is being led by the Communications
Electronics Security Group (CESG), part of the Government Communications
Headquarters (GCHQ), to assess this aggregated demand and generate
better coherence across Government. In essence, the objective of the work
will be to generate a “pyramid of demand” that could put the demand
for UK design and manufacture of high grade cryptography alongside
lid d G d d f l d d


traditional boundaries between land, sea and air forces are
blurring – network-enabled forces will further reduce the
divide and also means that systems must interoperate across
all environments, fusing outputs from multiple sensors.

B8.53 Although the vast majority of equipment expenditure is currently
via the established defence contractors, much of the systems content
is based upon exploitation of technologies derived from commercial
communications, computing, signal and data processing capabilities.
While many skills are applied to specifi c defence needs and constraints,
the individuals in possession of those skills are readily deployable outside
defence. Defence programmes also provide interesting and innovative
development work, although expertise can quickly waste and transfer to
commercial applications if there is insuffi cient business. This is a critical
consideration for sustainment, as work to modify long-serving systems is
likely to be constrained by intellectual rather than technical resource. This
is more signifi cant where there are challenging defence characteristics, for
example packaging for harsh environments, extreme security protection,
and extreme reliability. Indeed, the boundaries between the ‘business’ and
the ‘battlespace’ environments are blurring, with what might be considered
‘ ffi ’ li i d i b i d li d l h f li

in conjunction with industry via programmes such as NITEworks[2] and
DABINETT and the establishment of the Integration Authority but the
approach needs to be further developed into a coherent programme
delivery doctrine that includes all phases from concept to disposal.

**Research and technology**

B8.62 In order to sustain a vibrant onshore R&T base in this sector, both within
MOD and industry, we are maintaining an overall research programme in this
area currently funded at around £55M per annum. Figure B8(ii) illustrates the
proportion of the programme currently allocated to each of the major elements of
interest. This allocation will change as research priorities are adjusted to respond
to developing areas of interest, but it does refl ect a key aspect of our ability to
remain as an intelligent customer of emerging technologies and concepts.

**System engineering and assurance**
**and the ‘intelligent customer’**

B8.59 Availability of, and assured access to a systems engineering skill
base is critical to deliver the vision of NEC. We will need to maintain an
intelligent customer status, which will not be easy, given the pace of change
in the industrial and technology base dictated by the commercial market.

B8.60 Unlike the cryptography market there is a good spread of competent
systems engineering organisations within the UK and the global industrial
base. But set against that, the overall health of the C4ISTAR defence sector is
complicated by the fact that many of the underpinning technologies for C4I
in particular are also relevant to a much larger global commercial market.
Therefore we are in general a relatively minor customer in a market where
the pace of technological change creates its own set of unique pressures for
capability sustainment. The risk for us is not generally that the capability is
lost due to lack of demand but that the pace of change in the commercial
world, move a company’s capabilities away from the technological direction
we require. To mitigate this, we must ensure that the profi le of our
programmes, and the potential earnings yield is such as to allow companies
to use defence as well as commercial drivers to innovate and climb the
technological staircase. In this way, industry will be motivated to sustain
suffi cient skills sets to maintain and support our systems. This will require
greater attention to the profi t-risk mechanisms that we apply to our contracts.

B8.61 Finally, the ability to retain an understanding of the full system
in order to provide through-life support must be considered. In a number
of instances, it would not be appropriate for C4ISTAR equipments to be
supported off shore, especially where these include software modifi cations
that might reduce confi dence in information assurance. We have

**_Figure B8(ii)._**


B8.63 It is neither feasible nor aff ordable to sustain a critical capability
in all of the technologies of potential interest. However, we can expect that
much of the underlying technology and applied expertise will be driven
by the commercial marketplace and international defence investment.

B8.64 This will demand closer interaction with industry. Applicable
technology tends to be exploited across a number of projects, and
companies are constantly seeking to add technical value to improve
their competitive advantage and product diff erentiation. Private venture
investment could be augmented by our funding to advance knowledge and
engineering expertise. We would need some guaranteed return (as would
the company), if the chosen technology proved to be applicable to the
target project. We may also wish to make resulting IPR more accessible.

B8.65 We intend to examine whether this approach might be
realised via an extension of the Defence Technology Centre concept. The
associated MOD-industry consortium would need to maintain a view
of future technology, and of future programme requirements, in order
that future projects could benefi t from timely investment in new and
improved components. The selection of technologies and development of
applications would inform applied research and build a cadre of expertise,
reducing risks and timescales, and enhancing UK competitiveness.

**Presenting our requirements to the market**

B8.66 We will provide increased transparency of our capability
intentions (within obvious security considerations), clarity on aff ordability
constraints and better articulation of the desired enterprise outcome.


B8.67 We will also ensure coherence in our approach to the overall
NEC architecture, where this is relevant, and will share this with industry

- from high-level overviews, to more detailed expressions at functional
or capability level. The Ministry of Defence Architectural Framework
(MODAF) will be key to expressing NEC requirements in consistent terms
and contributing to the development of genuinely joined-up doctrine. This
will aid comprehension of intent between us as customer and industry
suppliers, and highlight key areas to be addressed in the development
of solutions such as interfaces, data specifi cations and protocols.

###### ��������������������


B8.68 Complementing this, we will wish to see solutions that make
the greatest use of open systems architecture approaches. The use of
interface standards that are non-proprietary, already established and
recognised by formal bodies, or which are accepted as de facto standards
by the market, should enable industry to develop solutions that maximise
commercial opportunities and assist future export potential (see fi gure
B8(iii). The challenge for us will be to avoid a shift to our simply being
a consumer with insuffi cient infl uence over system design. For some
requirements we may still need closed or only partially-open systems.

###### Conclusion


B8.69 C4ISTAR capabilities are essential to the achievement of NEC. In
support of this endeavour, the C4ISTAR industrial sector is broadly in good
health with signifi cant potential for enduring earnings across defence
and commercial customer bases. The forward C4ISTAR equipment and
associated support programmes represent a sizeable proportion of our
forward plans, recognising the priority we attach to delivering NEC. Beyond
certain high classifi cation requirements, our interests lie principally in the
sustainment of a highly skilled sector capable of undertaking complex systems
integration activities and supporting information assurance initiatives.
This is consistent with broader Government objectives to support the
further development of high technology industry and research in the UK.

B8.70 We can in general benefi t from the extended customer base
and the weight of civil investment it attracts. But there will also be a
continuing need to maintain awareness of the depth and breadth within
the UK industrial base of those skills necessary to meet and support highend defence requirements. In those areas there is a risk that unless the
skills are exercised regularly, they and/or their currency will diminish.


###### B8


B8.71 So the strategy for C4ISTAR will be to:

achieve better cross-Government coordination
of demand for cryptography;


**_Figure B8(iii)._**


**MODAF**

It has been recognised for some time within the MOD that a
consistent means of defi ning platform and system interfaces across
all MOD acquisition activities is a key enabler to achieving the
interoperability that is at the heart of Network Enabled Capability.
Therefore, a methodology for developing consistent architectures
across the MOD was developed, this methodology is MODAF.
The primary objectives of the implementation project are:


work with all areas of industry to target defence and commercial
research expenditure to activities that off er the greatest potential
Defence benefi t and which have clear exploitation paths;

continue to encourage a wider civil industry to explore the potential
application of its knowledge and products to the defence market;


give industry visibility of our forward plans, and
where appropriate the opportunity to help develop
potential solutions from an early stage;

identify intended system architectures and
associated interface details;


To develop an Architectural Framework based upon
defence and commercial best practice and to tailor this
to MOD-specifi c acquisition and operational processes.

To develop the directives and guidance necessary for
this architectural framework to be implemented.

To make recommendations to vendors such that suitable
tool sets are developed and made available to all of the
parties that may utilise the architectural framework.
To embed the business change required to
implement the architectural framework such that
it becomes self-sustaining without continued
input from the implementation project.


encourage and support the use of open systems architectures
and COTS products to the greatest practicable degree.

###### CBRN Force Protection
### B9


###### Defi nition

B9.1 The Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN)
protection capability area is focused on the development and
provision of capabilities that support our CBRN defence policy. These
capabilities are broken down into three broad categories:

**Timely warning - the detection and identifi cation of CBRN**
weapons and materials, with the ability to process data and
provide information to facilitate decision-taking and action;

**Survive - the capabilities, based around the person,**
necessary to survive a CBRN challenge: and

**Sustain - the unit/force level capabilities required to,**
confi rm the extent of a hazard, rapidly recover from an
event, and sustain/regain operational tempo.

###### Strategic overview

B9.2 We are committed to maintaining the UK’s political and
military freedom of action despite the presence, threat or use of CBRN
weapons. The spectrum of this threat is broad and may come from a
number of diff erent aggressors, from state-sponsored programmes to
international terrorist organisations. The 2003 Defence White Paper,
‘Delivering Security in a Changing World’, identifi ed international


###### CBRN Force Protection
### B9


terrorism and the proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)
as ‘the two most serious and direct threats to our peace and security’.

B9.3 As the CBRN threat becomes more diverse, the defensive CBRN
capability required by today’s service personnel inevitably broadens. Our
Armed Forces are able to deploy rapidly to almost any region of the world,
and face an increasing number of potential CBRN challenges. They may
come across remnants of discontinued CBRN programmes, encounter
endemic diseases that could be diffi cult to distinguish from biological
warfare (BW) attacks, or be exposed to toxic industrial hazards (TIHs).
In all cases, having the right capability is absolutely key to success.

B9.4 With the need for fl exible rapidly-deployable Armed Forces
that are able to operate in a number of diff erent circumstances, our force
protection posture requires similar fl exibility and should impart a low
physiological burden within a minimal logistical footprint. We are therefore
developing and enhancing integrated surveillance, warning and reporting,
monitoring, protection and detection capabilities. Fundamental to the
future of CBRN protection are the opportunities represented by Network
Enabled Capability (NEC). Intelligent networking will give increased
situational awareness and facilitate rapid hazard prediction. Data fusion
from a multitude of sensors will create the CBRN recognised picture.

B9.5 Aligned to the rapid technological development in this sector
of defence are the potential economies of scale to be found when
considering the wider CBRN market place. In particular this includes


**_P_** **_d_** **_l_** **_tCBRN_** **_dd_** **_t lt i i_** **_b_** **_dHMSINVINCIBLE_**


-----

the homeland defence/counter terrorism sector which is led by the
Home Offi ce and the consequence management area through the
Department of Health. A major strand of our industrial strategy is to
fully investigate how these economies can be exploited and we are fully
engaged with both the Home Offi ce[1] and the Department of Health[2].

B9.6 Strong CBRN force protection has always formed part of the UK’s
deterrent posture. We must equip our highly professional troops with advanced
equipment able to readily detect, withstand and respond to CBRN challenges.
Only by achieving this can we send the powerful message to all aggressors
that the impact of any CBRN attack will be low and never achieve its goal.


The Integrated Sensor Management System (ISMS), which
will provide a ‘plug and play’ suite of sensors to Land and Air forces,
will be one of the systems providing the BISA with information to
enable timely warning of a CBRN event. The system, which will be
able to interface with in-service chemical, radiological and nuclear
detectors, is to be delivered with a commercial off the shelf (COTS)
generic unmanned biological detection system and is planned to
enter service in 2006 and to have a service life into the 2020s.

UK military and civil biological detection and identifi cation
capability is a fundamental part of basic force protection. The
**Unmanned Biological Detection System (UBDS), which will**
be available by the end of the decade, and will provide generic
bio-detection to complement the ISMS programme. It will function
in concert with other in-service detectors and provide a base upon
which Biological Detection Tier 3 (BDT 3) can develop.


###### Equipment programmes

B9.7 The UK’s CBRN protection programme is focused on rapidly
developing emerging technology to deliver solutions to the complex
threat environment. The threat we face is almost limitless, from the more
conventional industrially manufactured weapons systems to the emergence
of global terrorism. To combat this signifi cant technical challenge there
are two main themes to the programme. The fi rst is a strong research
base that seeks to characterise the threat and establish the principles to
counter that threat. Second is an incremental acquisition approach to
deliver eff ective systems rapidly to the front line. Our targeted research,
therefore, drives industrial development, supports growth of intelligent
suppliers and infl uences priorities for investment. For this reason our
research establishment has been retained within Dstl, as a strategic asset.


**BDT 3 will combine stand-off detectors and simple sensors to provide**
a detect to warn capability. With future integration opportunities a
possibility, BDT 3 may replace some planned Detection, Identifi cation,
Monitoring and Analysis (DIMA) systems, such as UBDS. The system
is expected to be available by the middle of the next decade.


###### B9


B9.8 We take a systems approach to CBRN protection. The ability of industry
to deliver fully integrated systems, often from a wide variety of technology
suppliers is key. At the heart of the programme is NEC which will enable rapid
decision making and increased situational awareness. The CBRN programme is
divided into the conceptual groupings of Timely Warning, Survive and Sustain.

B9.9 Outlined below is the current CBRN equipment programme. Over
the coming months the programme is undergoing a review to enable more
eff ective capability management. It is the precursor to facilitate timely
incremental acquisition and the rapid exploitation of emerging technologies. It
will entail the brigading of the current programme assumptions under Timely
**Warning, Survive and Sustain and will probably recast the manner in**
which these assumptions are delivered. The net result is that the assumptions
remain valid, however, the project name and delivery profi le may change.


**_Man-portable Chemical Agent Detector._**

With a planned fi elding date for the end of this decade
the Maritime Biological Detection System (MBDS),
will provide the Royal Navy (RN) with a fully automated
biological detection and identifi cation (D&I) capability that
will give an increase in capability with a reduction in the
logistical burden associated with current D&I systems.


B9.10 **Timely Warning – the capabilities required to ‘warn the**
force… in time’ in order to avoid, to take decisive action, to protect:

Warning and reporting is a fundamental part of CBRN planning
and deterrence and is dependent on other command and control
systems, an agent database and national threat assessments.
These elements are, of necessity, classifi ed and their details must
remain within the UK. The NBC Battlefi eld Information System
**Application (BISA) is the software providing CBRN input to the**
networked battlespace, helping achieve NEC. It will be integrated
with other defence applications and enable operational decisions
to be made in anticipation of, or response to, a CBRN event.
Increment 1 is planned to be delivered in 2007. A further increment
with increased functionality is planned and should follow within
fi ve years. It is expected to have a service life into the 2020s.


The Lightweight Chemical Agent Detector (LCAD) and
**Man-portable Chemical Agent Detectors (MCAD) in-service**
since 2004 provide alarm at attack levels of Chemical Warfare
Agent (CWA). Both utilise Ion-Mobility Spectrometry
**(IMS) which is a pivotal technology to current capability and**
provides the foundation for the growth of future systems and
are expected to have a service life of at least 15 years.

**Stand Off Chemical Detector (SOCD) has a proposed delivery**
date in the middle of the next decade and will provide a stand off
liquid and vapour detection capability. It provides timely warning
(an alarm) and sustain (reconnoitre and survey) capabilities. It is
envisaged this will be a key component of future defence platforms.

The Joint CBRN Regiment’s Light Role Teams (LRTs) will
provide a strategic CBRN detection, identifi cation, monitoring,

light forces for rapid deployment. These specialist 8-man teams
also provide the operational commander with expert CBRN advice

and ability to prepare the way for follow-on forces. Expected
to be available in the latter half of this decade, the teams will
be self-suffi cient and have reach-back capability to the UK.

Dstl sponsored research on reagents is directly feeding into the Rapid
**Diagnosis System (RDS) which is being developed to identify illness**
that may have been caused by undetected low level exposure to
possible BW agents, TIHs or endemic disease. Anomalous symptom
events will be detected by the Real-time Medical Surveillance
**System (RMS) using software analysis to assist the man in the loop.**

B9.11 **Survive – the capabilities, based around**
man, ‘to survive a CBRN challenge’:

**Personal NBC Protection System (PNPS) will, by the middle of**
the next decade, provide all personnel with an integrated system
of Individual Protective Equipment (IPE) that gives protection
against a range of NBC hazards with a reduced physiological
burden. It will be aligned to the future soldier systems (such
as Future Integrated Soldier Technology, FIST) which may
aff ect the planned ISD. It will be used in conjunction with the
**General Service Respirator (GSR) which is due in-service**
by the end of next year. The GSR will provide very high levels
of respiratory protection while reducing the physiological and
psychological burden suff ered by personnel using this equipment
and is expected to have a service life well into the 2030s.

From the middle of the next decade, the Deployable Collective
**Protection System (DCPS) will provide an easily transportable**
and erectable collective protection system. It is an aspiration
to combine this with standard military tentage, where
considerations include coatings, fi ltration and decontamination.

The incrementally acquired Aircraft and Aircrew CBRN
**Survive to Operate (AACSTO) programme looks to provide**
protection and hazard management capability in aircraft
operations. It seeks to reduce the burden on the individual,
improve decontamination of aircraft and protect the insides of
certain aircraft from cross contamination. Due to be phased in
service from the middle of the next decade, the programme
represents a signifi cant enhancement to our current capability.

B9.12 **Sustain – the unit/force level capabilities to**
confi rm the extent of a hazard, to rapidly recover from an
event, and to sustain/regain operational tempo:

The NBC Reconnaissance & Survey (NBC R&S) programme
is designed to develop the capability gap left as Fuchs
(reconnaissance vehicle) approaches the end of its life.
Planned for introduction in the middle of the next decade
and currently planned as a FRES (Future Rapid Eff ects System)
variant which will deliver a full suite of CBRN detectors.

Using a multitude of systems to monitor a wide variety of surfaces,
including personnel, equipment, buildings and terrain the
**Chemical Monitoring Capability (CMC) is currently split into**
two programmes. The Surface Detection System (SDS) which
aims to confi rm and identify the presence of known threat chemical
agents will be used in conjunction with an Unmasking Aid (UA).
The preferred solution may involve the use of disclosure technology,
IMS and fl ame photometry. Biological Surface Monitoring
**Capability (BSMC) will provide a biological equivalent to SDS. Both**

**_Troops based in Qatar, practice masking-up drills during an NBC drill._**

**Multi Level Decontamination (MLD) is aimed at**
providing a ‘thorough’ decontamination capability at unit
level through the joint operational area, from personnel to
sensitive equipment and whole platform and is expected
to be available in the middle of the next decade.

**Unit Decontamination Capability (UDC) is a programme**
to provide a low burden integrated self-contained ‘thorough’
decontamination capability to enable the removal of IPE
and reduce casualties. Planned to be available by the
latter half of this decade, it may become part of a system
of systems within the longer term MLD programme.

**Aircrew Chemical Agent Detector (ACAD) will provide**
a chemical detection capability with unparalleled levels of
sensitivity from the middle of the next decade. It is an aspiration
to merge ACAD with the replacement unmasking aid to deliver a
widely deployable capability which upgrades/replaces LCAD.

The recently delivered Tactical Radiation Monitoring Equipment
**(TRaME) provides a comprehensive suite of detectors and monitors**
for our use on the battlefi eld. In addition sensors, for a number of
current and future platforms, are being researched in conjunction
with the host platform’s development. Therefore, those platform
based detectors fall outside the scope of this chapter. TRaME is inservice now and is expected to have a service life of into the 2020s.

**Medical Countermeasures (Med CM). Whilst protection**
from, and avoidance of Biological and Chemical attack may be
possible, there are many scenarios in which our forces could be
exposed to biological and chemical agents. In these instances
eff ective Med CM will be essential in avoiding casualties and
maintaining operational tempo. Med CM can be delivered either
as pre or post event prophylaxis, or as post exposure therapy.

The MOD has a vigorous research and development programme
in this area based around the widely recognised excellence
and expertise of Dstl and is addressing nerve agent antidotes,
vaccines and antitoxins. Within the next fi ve years we plan that an
improved nerve agent antidote, a licensed antitoxin and a number
of vaccines will have been fi elded. In the subsequent decade it is
anticipated that further countermeasures will be made available.

###### Indicative planning assumptions

B9.13 Figure B9(i) illustrates our current assumptions for CBRN spend
over the next 10 years. This includes the planned spend on the Equipment
Plan (EP), the cost of maintaining and operating the equipment captured
within the Short Term Plan (STP) and the planned research funding to
identify and develop new technologies to support the EP. The UK will
spend around £120M on CBRN protection acquisition, support and research
next year. The total CBRN package is planned to increase out to 2015 as a
number of the large programmes are delivered. We will continue to focus
on developing new technical solutions, whilst maintaining and improving
our existing capability. The CBRN programme described above does not
include the investment made as part of the platform based programmes.


B9.17 In order to deliver these key functions we need access
to an industrial base that, as a minimum, is capable of providing
a world-class capability in the following broad areas:

**Intelligent Supplier. Due to the rapid pull through of technology**
and the complexity of the CBRN area, our prime concern is the
retention onshore of the intelligent supplier who should have
in-depth knowledge of CBRN in terms of the technical solutions
available and the context in which we will use them. This concept
underpins the relationship we have with industry, guaranteeing
supply and ensuring both our Armed Forces and industrial base
remain at the forefront of technology. The intelligent supplier
should be comfortable working closely with the defence
research base to develop principles and deliver solutions.


Exploit emerging technology and developing equipment/systems;
Control CBRN technology proliferation[4];
Maintain a national CBRN focus to infl uence across defence[5];
Exploit economies of scale across Government;
Respond to Urgent Operational Requirements (UORs);
Retain credible involvement in CBRN deterrence;
Maintain security of supply.

**_Figure B9(i) - Illustrative spend profi le._**
_The above graph shows indicative spending in this sector over the next_
_ten years. The fi gures from 08/09 are illustrative and include a range in_
_order to emphasise the potential for shifts in investment priorities after_
_the end of the current Spending Review period. This is prudent planning_
_which does not distort the overall illustrative picture of general trends._

###### What is required for retention in the UK industrial base?


**System Engineering. CBRN systems are complex and very few**
contractors possess all the skills to deliver the complete solution
purely from in-house resources. Vital to us is the retention onshore
of the ability to Systems Engineer. The component parts may well be
sourced off shore, however, the ability to deliver the total package,
inclusive of those security sensitive items is key. This will allow the
development of systems that suit our military doctrine and whose
procurement strategy is not aff ected by other nations’ strategic goals.


###### B9


B9.14  The CBRN capability area and the associated industrial sector are
distinctive in that the UK’s posture is purely defensive. In addition the UK
is a State Party to a number of non-proliferation treaties[3]. This governs the
breadth of the market place for our industrial partners often limiting the
scope of R&D activities, what can be sold, and also to which countries. The
global commercial free fl ow of sensitive technology is further limited by our
national security concerns and those of our international allies.  Therefore,
the need to retain a technological advantage in the fi eld aligned to our
national strategic priorities drives us to retain a strong on-shore focus.

B9.15 The UK is at the forefront of the development and production
of CBRN protection systems. This is in the main due to an exceptionally
strong research programme in conjunction with the UK’s successful
development and manufacturing base. This places the UK in a unique
position with its strategic partners. In particular, the UK can achieve very
advantageous research and technology partnering through international
agreements and as such exerts signifi cant strategic infl uence.


**Technology Exploitation. The sensitivity of specifics of the**
CBRN threat and a lack of demand in the commercial sector
drive us to invest a significant amount in R&T; the output
being a proof of principle or the identification of a technology
that with further development would deliver a significant
increase to the capability of CBRN protection. This development
is only possible using the Intelligent Suppliers mentioned
above. Technologies of particular note that must be retained
and developed on-shore are those associated with: Chemical
**Detection and Identification,** **Biological Agent Detection**
**and Identification, Physical Protection and Warning and**
**Reporting. In all these areas the UK specific protection factors**
and the underpinning intelligence to support them makes the
use of offshore suppliers undesirable. In addition the strategic
priority associated with CBRN makes the reliance on a third
country for the development of technology impossible. The UK is
a world leader ion-mobility spectrometry and the maintenance of
this capability in the UK gives a special influence in collaboration.
The arguments for not allowing defence capabilities to be
dependent on the availability of technology and manufactured
products from overseas are equally valid in this area.

_[4] Non-proliferation and export licences are considered fundamental_
_to continued development of the industrial base while protecting key_
_technologies and the military advantage - this provides a win-win for_
_us and industry. This extends from the development of Dstl research,_
_through provision of a protected supply chain to disposal._

_[5] CBRN technologies and thinking must be integrated with overall military_
_capability. It is intrinsic to all areas and, as a common enabler, the requirements_
_f CBRN_ _i_ _b_ _id_ _d_ _h_ _li_ _f ll_ _i i i_


B9.16 Providing eff ective CBRN protection is a constant battle to
develop technological solutions to complex problems. Taking advantage
of rapidly developing technology, incrementally, to continuously increase
our capability is essential, in conjunction with a focused and agile
industrial sector. Maintaining this capability on-shore will result in a
supplier base which fully understands the UK’s approach to CBRN and
is not distracted by other nations’ strategic goals. It is therefore vital
to guarantee access to the following key functions in the CBRN area in
order to enable the delivery of military eff ects to the Armed Forces:

-----

**Supply of Raw Materials. In conjunction with the need to ensure**
security of supply of technology is the need to ensure an onshore
manufacturer that can provide certain key raw materials. It is
our intent to reduce the reliance of large stockpiles and engage
in procurement based on surge production. Of particular note in
this respect is the supply of Anti Gas Cloth for CBRN protective
suits where we must be able to guarantee a product that meets
our stringent quality and protection requirements. Certain other
raw materials are fundamental to the UK’s biological defence
capability and their security, quality and guaranteed supply must not
be compromised. The ability to surge, with the associated logistic
implications will be carefully considered on a case by case basis.

**Medical Countermeasures Manufacture. Medical**
Countermeasures are the most sensitive area of our CBRN interests.
The capabilities of the countermeasures and the defi nition of the
threat that they counter is of such a sensitive nature that sole reliance
on off shore development and manufacturing is impossible. Certain
agreements do exist with our close Allies to share research and in some
instances collaboration in procurement exists, however, the retention
of a strong UK skills and manufacture base is vital.  This industrial
process is also of signifi cant interest to other Government departments.

###### Overview of the current global and UK market

B9.18 CBRN protection requirements have for some time been
met through a healthy and competitive industrial market place.
All of the current larger value contracts have been established
through competitive tendering exercises with, notably, no single
contractor more successful than the other main competitors.


B9.19 The supplier base within the UK is strong and growing due in part to
increased focus on the homeland defence market. This is attracting suppliers
who have not previously shown a defence interest, which should benefi t us
by facilitating access to innovative solutions and technologies. The industry is
represented by NBC UK, a special interest group within the Defence Manufacturers’
Association. The membership of 55 companies has a signifi cant interest in CBRN
either as integrators, manufacturers in their own right or as sub-contractors.
Those represented span every fi eld from CBRN protection for the individual
(clothing) via man-portable detection equipment right through to large highly
specialised systems and equipments for the detection and identifi cation of
biological agents. Currently UK industry has interests in the home market as
well as the increasingly profi table international sector[6]. The industry remains
fi rmly focused on meeting domestic requirements; however, although the UK
market is buoyant and our predicted spend is likely to increase, the US market
continues to present an attractive commercial proposition to industry. If industry
fails to achieve its commercial expectations within the UK, its focus may shift
from not only exploiting US opportunities as they arise, but diverting research
and technology investment into that market. UK industrial consolidation
and development into the US would therefore present a risk to us associated
with technology transfer and could harm our operational eff ectiveness.

B9.20 Although the number of companies interested in CBRN business is
large, often the contractors are relatively small and specialist. There are only a
few companies that could be considered targets as industrial partners or capable
of providing a prime contractor role. These are currently: Smiths Detection
(detection and identifi cation), General Dynamics UK (systems integration and
manufacture), SERCO Assurance (systems integration), EDS (systems integration).

_[6] Example: Smiths Detection has recently made inroads into the_
_Japanese market. The industry’s most profi table sector is the_
_US marketplace, both military and homeland defence._

###### Sustainment strategy

B9.21 The UK’s commercial CBRN sector is buoyant. To manage eff ectively
both MOD’s and industry’s aspirations the following strategy will be followed:


Incrementally acquire to deliver solutions rapidly and
avoid the feast or famine cycle for industry.

Explore innovative partnering opportunities to protect and develop
the priority capabilities and processes we wish to retain in the UK.

Continue to focus research on the early
transfer of technology to industry.

Maximise the economies of scale from
eff ective cross Government working.
Early engagement with industry to establish how best they can
achieve their global commercial aspirations within the boundaries
imposed by the use of UK specifi c sensitive technologies.

B9.22 The CBRN procurement strategy is thus primarily one of competition
that seeks the best candidate to ensure value for money whilst guaranteeing
performance levels. Whole life cost is a particular concern as is the reduction
of risk. Whilst the onshore industrial base is buoyant and generally able to
deliver, off shore suppliers will not be precluded unless their inclusion increases
risk, in particular those based around security, security of supply and protection
of sensitive information. We recognise that to maintain an ‘intelligent supplier’
base in the UK some of the development, production and support contracts
will have to be targeted at UK based industry. International Agreements on
non-proliferation will also be honoured. We will explore however the potential
costs and benefi ts of partnering, particularly with the four main industrial
players in the UK, to see whether other acquisition models could allow us to
achieve rapid and innovative acquisition alongside better value for money.

B9.23 To protect what we assess as our priority capabilities, should
the marketplace become less buoyant, CBRN research within Dstl has
been retained as a strategic asset. This enables the underlying science to
be progressed to a point where technology transfer to industry can take
place. Therefore, research across the spectrum of Dstl’s activity is focused
on the delivery of technical solutions to the CBRN problem, which is
readily available for industrial exploitation. If necessary Dstl can produce
fi eldable solutions in niche areas where there is no commercial market.


###### Way ahead

B9.24 We will analyse the opportunities available within wider
Government to derive economies of scale for equipment purchased across
Departments, building on the existing dialogue between MOD, the Home
Offi ce and the Department of Health. This will include investigating the
potential for co-operative purchasing, shared research, stockpile sharing
and joint contracting. Additionally, whilst we have been successful in
utilising competition as a procurement strategy in the past, we want to
work with industry, in particular those companies who are members of
NBC UK, to look at the benefi ts of other models, such as partnering, for
acquisition to ensure continued value for money whilst maintaining an
innovative and fl exible supply-chain. This work will begin in early 2006.


###### B9


The development of the world’s fi rst regeneratable NBC fi ltration
systems now coming into production for the UK’s TITAN and
TROJAN engineering tank systems and the TERRIER battlefi eld
engineering vehicle, were a direct spin-in of commercially
funded research and development. These systems,were
developed by Domnick Hunter Ltd for TITAN and TROJAN, and
by the combined eff orts of Ametek, Aircontrol Technologies
and Pall for TERRIER. The systems were de-risked by the use
of MOD funded Technology Demonstrator Programmes (TDPs),
and we see TDPs as an important mechanism in the future.

###### Counter Terrorism
### B10


###### Defi nition

B10.1 Counter terrorism (CT) is a pan-Government activity, the policy
responsibility for which sits primarily with the Home Offi ce (for activities
internal to the UK) and the Foreign & Commonwealth Offi ce (for activities
overseas). The MOD provides military support, and takes the lead, in those
areas where military forces on operations are at risk from terrorist attack.

###### Strategic overview

B10.2 The threat from international terrorism to the security and
economic interests of the UK, its partners and its allies will, for the
foreseeable future, derive from individuals and networks motivated
by extremist ideologies which are committed to an international
campaign against the West and those nations and governments
associated with Western ideals or interests. Their activities will be
marked by an extreme ruthlessness in seeking to maximise civilian
casualties. Suicide attacks will be a feature of their operations.
They will exploit as mass-eff ect weapons readily available means
such as aircraft and tankers, and they will aim to develop Chemical,
Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) means of attack.

B10.3 The threat presented by terrorist networks will be
enduring, although the level of support and sympathy for their
objectives from host nations will depend upon: the degree of
economic prosperity imbalance with the West; the impact of reform
and progress towards democratisation; the eff ectiveness of CT
operations; progress with key issues such as the Middle East Peace
Process; and the scale of cultural antipathy towards the West.

B10.4 Given the nature of the threat, capabilities traditionally
needed in niche areas and Northern Ireland are increasingly becoming
required across the force structure. This reinforces the importance
of the counter terrorism sector, a sector to which the UK is a major
contributor, and provides greater opportunities for both industry
and MOD to become more cost-eff ective in the CT fi eld.


###### Counter Terrorism
### B10


###### Equipment programmes

B10.5 The development and procurement of specialist CT capabilities is
largely led by the Director of Equipment Capability (Special Projects) – DEC
(SP) – and the Special Projects Integrated Projects Teams (IPTs) within
the Defence Procurement Agency. Procurement projects are currently
being run in the areas of mobility, communications, force protection and
improvised explosive device detection and disposal, amongst others.
The details of these projects remain classifi ed, and are contained in a
separate and expanded version of this chapter, the details of which are
available to suitably qualifi ed companies at the MOD’s discretion.

B10.6 Many of the projects being run by DEC(SP) and the Special
Projects IPTs have utility outside the CT arena, and could, for instance,
support general Special Forces (SF) operations in wartime.

###### Indicative planning assumptions

B10.7 CT requirements are captured within the Capability
Area Plan (CAP) for DEC(SP) within the MOD, and drive both
the research into and procurement of new equipment.

B10.8 Figure B10(i) illustrates the currently assumed overall
resources for the CT Equipment Programme, Short Term Plan
support costs and CT research over the next decade.

B10.9 It is worth noting that the MOD’s spending in this sector have
been bolstered over recent years by spending on Urgent Operational
Requirements. The UK will continue to require the wherewithal
to rapidly advance new technologies into the front-line.

_which does not distort the overall illustrative picture of general trends._

###### Capability priorities

B10.10 In contrast to many of the areas covered by the rest of the DIS,
CT is underpinned by technologies utilised in many areas of industry
– from the cutting-edge physics of electro-optics and RF sources
through to the rather cruder, though no less important, problems of
hi l bili d i li d li i h I

details of the technology need to be protected, as their exposure would
reveal critical military capabilities. In other cases the technology used
is well understood, but the particular way it is implemented within
a system, or the way it is used on an operation, remain sensitive.
B10.11 Although there are aspects of the technology base within the
development, manufacture and sustainment of a CT system that need to
be retained within UK industry, it is primarily within the areas of systems
engineering (including design and development), testing and evaluation, and
system packaging that the MOD needs to be able to prevent critical elements
of its CT capability from transferring overseas. It is critical to the UK’s ability
to conduct CT operations, for instance, that design authority for the
**majority of its specialist equipment is retained within UK industry.**

**Overview of current global and UK market**


be able to off er solutions to its problems, while on the other hand UK
industry does not have visibility of the set of CT-related capability gaps
that the MOD is attempting to fi ll. Mitigation activities which are either
under way, or are planned, to ameliorate this situation include:

creating an Industry Liaison Offi cer within the Special Projects IPTs,
to act as the initial point of contact for queries and approaches;


arranging early briefi ng for industry on forthcoming CTrelated procurement projects via Industrial Briefi ng Days;

maintaining a list of ‘key trusted suppliers’ who could be given greater
access to the MOD’s CAP for the CT area, thus facilitating better
transition from MOD research into commercial/bespoke products;


B10.12 We believe that the UK industry is generally robust in the CT arena
(an assessment that covers both those companies supplying what they
know to be specialist CT equipment and those whose products may have a
number of uses, some of which happen to be CT in nature). Procurements
are spread across many hundreds of suppliers, ranging from large multinational companies to small manufacturers of niche devices, although
in the latter case there are believed to be no suppliers who are entirely
dependent on the MOD for their commercial viability. There is a system
for classifying the suppliers that make up the CT sector, on the basis of
their security clearance and utility of their products, known as ‘List X’.

B10.13 Approximately 50% of CT-related procurement within the
MOD is commercial-off -the-shelf (COTS), where existing equipment is
either used directly by UK SF or others, or (in a small percentage of cases)
modifi ed following purchase to render it more covert, more robust,
more usable or more eff ective. Whilst there are ways of improving the
relationship between MOD and industry, we believe there is no urgent
remedial action required to sustain key industrial capabilities.

**_Overt surveillance camera deployed in extreme weather conditions._**


many of the requirements are highly classifi ed (i.e. SECRET or above).

B10.17 With the exception of various niche capabilities, retention
or otherwise of CT-related industrial capability within the UK
occurs mainly in the areas of system design and engineering,
and testing and evaluating of specialist equipment.


maintaining an ongoing ‘industry watch’ to identify companies
whose products might fi ll known capability gaps;

using the CAP and the ‘industry watch’ jointly to engage early with
industry and encourage them to develop, on a ‘no-commitment’
basis, modifi ed off -the-shelf versions of COTS products;


declassifying (to the greatest extent possible) Invitations
to Tender (ITTs) issued in the DPA Contracts Bulletin;

assisting companies who might have something to off er in the
CT procurement arena to achieve List X status independent
of an actual contract competition, thus allowing them
greater access to classifi ed requirements information;


###### B10


combining capability gap analysis and subsequent
equipment procurement with Other Government
Departments in order to expedite development, achieve
interoperability and deliver economies of scale.

###### Conclusion


B10.16 The MOD approach to CT-related procurement can be
characterised by several broad statements, as follows:

it covers a diverse and wide technology base;


it is fast-moving and reactive to known threats;

it involves a large number of small companies and a
relatively small number of large companies;


it involves a signifi cant amount of COTS purchasing;


**Sustainment strategy**

B10.14 There is a generally recognised need within the CT community
for greater early engagement with industry. At the same time, it
must be acknowledged that CT covers a wide area, and a variety
of engagement mechanisms appropriate to the challenges facing
the diff erent technological areas need to be established.


B10.18 No sustainability issues are currently evident, but
through greater engagement with industry the MOD will be
able to anticipate and address any emerging issues.

###### Technology priorities to enable defence capability
### B11


B11.1 The analysis by major platform sector in this strategy has
identifi ed a number of industrial capabilities which the UK will need
to retain on-shore. Key technologies that underpin these sectors have
also been discussed. Our recent Technology Strategy[1] and the National
Defence Industry Technology Strategy[2] also provide specifi c information
on the importance of technologies for defence capability. This section
draws together the critical underpinning and cross cutting technologies
that need to be sustained in the UK in support of sectoral strategies.

B11.2 Some of this technology will be available from the broader
industrial base, for instance COTS solutions. Furthermore as the global
investment in R&T continues to increase, and as an ever larger number of
countries contribute to this overall growth, it is impossible for us to support
cutting edge activity across all areas of R&T of relevance to defence.

B11.3 To take forward the DIS we need to identify what we need to
be good at to protect our security and sovereignty. This should help
to sustain and indeed enhance the competitiveness of our Defence
industry. We also need an objective understanding of what we are
good at and those key areas where Defence must still lead.

B11.4 Our increased collection of and reliance upon information derived
from many diff erent sensors, based on varied platforms, has many implications.
These include the need for more R&T on the human factors that determine
information assimilation and appropriate action, and the need to design
information networks across diff erent components of military capability.

B11.5 The life expectancy of major platforms is increasing due in part
to the costs of replacement. This generates an increased emphasis on the
need for equipment and systems to be fl exible to meet unpredictable
demands, adaptable to ensure connectivity in a network enabled world,
and capable of continuous upgrade and rapid technology insertion.

B11.6 In order to address these issues, the UK will need to
have a leading edge understanding in the areas of:

overall equipment design and integration;
design and performance of sub-systems;
properties and limitations of key components;
through-life capability management;
delivering cost eff ective military solutions.

B11.7 Furthermore, to support future adaptation and
integration our supplier base will need to have:

the ability to control and manage equipment
design, modifi cation and integration;

suffi cient knowledge of, and access to, sub-system design and
manufacture to allow modifi cation and re-confi guration;
knowledge of, and access to, the key components and
technologies needed to support upgrades.

###### Technology priorities to enable defence capability
### B11


###### Technologies on which the UK needs to sustain or develop technological strengths

B11.8 In order to support the industrial capabilities identifi ed across
the sectoral analysis there are a number of areas in which the UK must
sustain existing technological strengths or where we should consider
developing our expertise. The technologies described here support a
number of sectors and capabilities. Other important technologies will be
needed on-shore to support more specifi c sectoral or capability needs.

B11.9 These technical areas can be discussed in terms of:

technology that can be inserted into future capability solutions
and will directly improve the delivery of military eff ect;

technology which will enhance enabling processes to the
delivery of capability and enhance decision making;

technology for which no specifi ed capability or eff ect has been
identifi ed, but where technology watch is required as future
exploitation or mitigation of that technology may become important.

###### Technologies for future capability solutions

B11.10 **Secure and robust communication technologies – future**
defence capability against diverse and often asymmetric threats will
depend on secure and robust communications. While we will benefi t
greatly from the large civil investment in communications, defence
communications systems have to be rapidly deployed in widely varying
circumstances, work in very diffi cult environments and often off er a high
degree of security, both short and long term. Key technologies are:

information infrastructure;
cryptography.

B11.11 **Data and information technologies – an increasing reliance**
on information and intelligence to maintain superiority over our opponents
means that the ability to process, manage and exploit the wide range and
large volume of data available to the armed forces remains vital to the UK.
Again much of the underpinning technological developments will come from
civil investment but UK defence will need to maintain and develop expertise in:

image analysis;
target identifi cation and tracking algorithms;
data fusion;
network design and stability.

B11.12 **Sensor technologies – sensors remain absolutely critical to**
nearly all aspects of defence capability including situational awareness and
detection and identifi cation of targets. Our ability to fi nd, identify and localise
targets, many of which may be heavily concealed, in cluttered environments,
or mobile, relies to a very large extent on the performance and correct use of
advanced sensors. Battlespace and situational awareness, including battle
damage assessment, rely on the development of systems to ensure full
integration between the sensors and mission and weapon programming
i i i I ddi i h l h h d i f h i l

and biological agents are becoming increasingly important to our defence
capability. For electro-magnetic sensing, the all-weather performance off ered
by sensors working at Radio Frequency (RF) (e.g. radar) is complementary to
the high resolution images off ered by compact Electro-Optic (EO) sensing.
Where size is less of an issue, the benefi ts of Synthetic Aperture Radar
(SAR) are slowly emerging. Consequently, technologies supporting these,
as well as other more specialised sensors such as sonar and chemical and
biological agent detectors, are critical to UK defence. Key technologies are:

radar and RF engineering (e.g. phased arrays; low mass/power
consumption technologies, multi-function RF systems);

EO sensors;
sonar;
detectors for chemical and biological agents;
sensor integration.


**_Signature management © Ultra._**

B11.16 **Technologies for remote and autonomous operation - the**
personnel of our armed forces are our most valuable resource and we seek to
deploy autonomous systems wherever possible and appropriate, in order to
protect and make best use of our people. Automation and remote operation
are very important technical capabilities for delivering this aspect of policy. A
great deal will be available from the civil sector but many aspects of remote
operation will need to be tailored to defence needs. In addition to the
guidance technologies discussed above, the main areas of interest include:


###### B11


semi-autonomous sensing and processing;
computer assisted decision making;
accurate underwater navigation;
long endurance propulsion techniques;
low power electronics.


**_Optics lab measuring MTF of an infrared lens © BAE Systems._**

B11.13 **Guidance and control technologies – precision eff ects**
are central to UK defence aims and needs. These will continue
to be underpinned by expertise in technologies for precision
guidance and control. An area where UK has, and should maintain,
a world lead is in autonomous and semi-autonomous systems for
advanced guidance of weapons and uninhabited platforms.


B11.14 **Electronic combat technologies – like sensors, electronic**
combat techniques are important across many areas of defence capability
and much of the underlying technology base is shared with radar. It is likely
that the UK will increasingly wish to develop and deploy integrated systems
that combine sensing and electronic combat technologies in a single more
effi cient and eff ective payload. Technologies essential to this area are:

threat detection, identifi cation and localisation
(Electronic Support Measures);

electronic Counter Measures;
electronic Warfare;
RF and EO Directed Energy Weapons;
RF engineering to support electronic combat.


B11.17 **Automated Information and Knowledge technologies**

- underpinning all of the above will be automated decision aids to ensure
an appropriate and timely response, particularly against short-range
high speed threats. Moving forward from the core technologies discussed
in B11.11, there are a number of emerging technology areas in the
information and analysis space that are developing rapidly. We must
track and, where appropriate, exploit advances in these areas, such as:

information and data management;
data mining and information extraction;
self adapting networks;
data storage;
Advanced Digital Signal Processing;
high bandwidth secure data-links;
high bandwidth encryption.


B11.15 **Integrated survivability – a high level of survivability, for**
equipment and personnel, is central to UK defence policy. In order to survive
against the broad range of potential threats it is important that survivability
is addressed at a holistic system level. Key technologies for survivability are:

low observables and signature control;
lightweight and novel armour systems;
defensive aids systems, including EO and RF Counter Measures;
Ch i l Bi l i l R di l i l d N l i


B11.18 **Power source and supply technologies - as our defence systems,**
including our soldiers, become more capable through being better equipped, and
we seek to deploy lighter forces more rapidly and with a lower logistic burden,
power sources of all types are an increasing priority. Key technologies that we
will need to understand and exploit, or modify to meet military applications, are:

effi cient motive power for vehicles and power supply for systems;
personal power sources;
fuel cells.


B11.19 We also recognise that integrated propulsion and power
plant in UCAVs could become a critical defence capability as demand
for power is driven by increasingly complex embedded electronics;
and that UK excellence in propulsion provides the opportunity to
i i i d i hi f h l


-----

B11.20 **Human Performance – alongside the development**
and exploitation of the autonomous and semi-autonomous
systems discussed above, the human will be the key decision
maker at every level of command. It is therefore vital that research
is undertaken into human decision making, cognitive processes,
and techniques to enhance elements of human performance.

###### Technologies for enhancing capability delivery

B11.21 **Technologies to support system integration and support**

- as we face a more diverse range of threats we will need to ensure that our
capability is fl exible, adaptable and capable of upgrade. We will, at the
same time, need to ensure that the high level of connectivity and integration
required for eff ective Network Enabled Capability is maintained. This
fl exible networked capability will require development and exploitation, or
intelligence in accessing and militarisation, of technologies to support:

logistics (particularly COTS technologies
e.g. asset tagging & tracking);

advanced modelling for analysis and experimentation
including eff ects based operations;

numerical methods for simulation and Test & Evaluation;
new decision support models;
open architectures;
architectures and design to support technology insertion;
obsolescence management;
advanced data-loggers and failure algorithms;
assessment and mitigation of environmental impact.

###### Technologies with emerging defence relevance

B11.22 In the sections above technologies important to defence
have been grouped together to highlight where they are of particular
importance. There are, of course, other technologies showing promise
across a range of defence applications that may have either a large impact
on specifi c defence capabilities or a more widespread impact across
many aspects of defence. These can provide both an increased threat and
opportunities for improved defensive capability. Examples include:

smart materials and structures;
Micro Electro-mechanical Machines (MEMS)
for reduced size, weight and cost;

novel energetic materials with enhanced properties;
supersonic and hypersonic technologies;
biotechnology and the eff ect on human
performance (e.g. countermeasures to complex
molecules with mood altering properties);

wideband, high power electronics;
quantum state systems for computing and communications;
the wide potential of nanotechnology.


**_Summary of technology areas ._**

###### Next stages of analysis of R&D priorities

B11.22 Following on from this statement of priorities, we need a further
level of analysis that will form the basis of further work in 2006. This will
allow us to better understand and describe the nature of these technologies,
where they are in the supply chain, and the level of existing UK expertise.
This analysis will enable further discussion and planning with industry on:

those areas in which maintaining a UK capability is
of vital strategic importance (here the security and
viability of UK supply chain is essential);

where we can and should collaborate in both industry
and university sectors at home and abroad;

where we can buy military sub-systems and components, but to
adapt and integrate (here the supply chain must be acceptable,
sustainable and secure. This requires intelligent customer
expertise, including assessment of product fi tness-for-purpose);
where we can buy COTS (but must have
intelligent customer expertise).

###### Test and Evaluation

### B12


###### Defi nition

B12.1 A Test and Evaluation (T&E) capability is a combination of facilities,
equipment, people, skills and methods, which enable the demonstration,
measurement and analysis of the performance of a system and the assessment
of the results. This can range from testing a simple switch to evaluating
complex systems, such as the performance characteristics of a warship.


###### Test and Evaluation

### B12


B12.4 During the concept and assessment phases of the CADMID acquisition
cycle, there will be a signifi cant requirement to test new technologies
and concepts in particular to ensure their feasibility for use, for both new
equipment procurement and upgrades. For new technologies under
development, some T&E will be undertaken via modelling in synthetic
environments and laboratory analysis in order to obtain an informed view
on feasibility without resorting to potentially expensive physical testing.

**Decision-making**


other things the performance characteristics of the equipment, how it
operates with other military capabilities and importantly that it is safe to use.

**Design and development**


###### Strategic overview

B12.2 T&E is vital to the development, introduction into service and
through-life support of the equipment used by our Armed Forces. It
contributes to a variety of activities, which reduce risk to our Armed Forces.

**Assurance that systems are safe and**
**suitable for military use**


B12.3 The traditional but still relevant view of T&E relates to the testing
of equipment before it enters service with the Armed Forces. These activities
occur following completion of equipment development and prototyping.
As we move towards an incremental acquisition system there will be a
requirement for more Test and Evaluation to take place on platforms and other
equipment through-life, as and when upgrade and modifi cation work takes
place. There will be a wide range of testing undertaken on the equipment,
in a variety of diff erent environments and scenarios to ensure that it meets
the exacting needs of the Armed Forces. This often necessitates the need for
dedicated ranges and facilities, both in the UK and abroad to test amongst

**_Mi il R_** **_l ti_** **_Si_** **_l ti_** **_F ilit_** **_tD tl_**


B12.5 Access to T&E facilities and capabilities are important when
down-selecting equipment or technology solutions.  They enable
the decision maker to be aware of the variety of factors relevant to
the equipment or technology, how they perform and any associated
risks, enabling recommendations about new and adapted equipment
or technology for procurement. We place particular focus within our
procurement processes on the importance of this type of early risk
reduction within equipment programmes. This helps both to ensure
an understanding of expected military capability but also to facilitate
greater value for money later on in the procurement process as we will
have developed an understanding (and where possible mitigated) of
risks associated with new technology and equipment development.

**_Figure B12(i) – Major LTPA T&E sites._**

**Tactical and operational development**

B12.6 The use of T&E capabilities is paramount for testing equipment
and technology within tactical and operational scenarios, in order to
mirror battle conditions where a true appreciation can be gauged of the
military eff ectiveness of the capability tested. T&E facilities also present
opportunities to test the interoperability of our military capability with our
allies, to help ensure eff ective coalition deployments and expeditions.

###### T&E locations

B12.7 We use a mixture of in-house, Government Owned Contractor
Operated (GoCo) and commercial T&E facilities to support the acquisition
and sustainment of military capability. These are a mixture of UK and
overseas assets. Figure B12(i) indicates the location of the major MOD T&E
sites operated on our behalf by QinetiQ under the Long Term Partnering
Agreement (LTPA) and indicates the type of services they provide.

B12.8 The LTPA is a £5.6bn 25-year contract covering the MODowned T&E facilities previously operated by the Defence Evaluation and
Research Agency (DERA). All these capabilities are kept under constant
review to ensure that they continue to meet our T&E requirements and
to identify potential rationalisation or effi ciency opportunities.

B12.9 The map shows the breadth of T&E testing that is undertaken on-shore
via the LTPA. A number of privately-owned facilities are not shown, but provide
additional or similar types of T&E capability. For example, BAE Systems operate
an aircraft testing facility at Warton in Lancashire, next to their fast jet production

B12.10 A number of trials are also conducted overseas because, for
example, particular environmental conditions cannot be naturally
replicated within the UK e.g. hot/dry (desert), hot/humid (jungle), cold/
icing climates or due to other constraints (e.g. physical lack of suitable
space) or because they require facilities that do not exist in the UK.

B12.11 There is a balance to be struck between retaining in the
UK the required range of T&E facilities and avoiding duplication
and overcapacity. This implies a clear understanding of the our T&E
requirements, on which we have work in hand. It also implies the need,
in the context of the LTPA, to keep under review the size and shape
of the T&E industrial base. An in depth study of LTPA requirements is
due to complete next year, as part of the fi ve yearly LTPA process.

###### T&E vision

B12.12 The vision is to establish an eff ective, cost-effi cient and coherent
approach to allow for the testing and evaluation of equipment to support
military capability both through research prior to, and then throughout
the CADMID cycle. The vision includes aspects such as training, tactics,
doctrine and procedures and the use of more operationally realistic
and measurable T&E environments. There is little doubt that future
T&E capabilities will need to provide the means to identify, and then
reduce, technical, programme and cost risks from the earliest possible
stages of acquisition through both synthetic and physical means.

B12.13 The realisation of our vision will require optimisation,
and development, of existing UK T&E facilities coupled
i h l i f h i i F l


�������

���������������


-----

greater mobility, and deployability, of complex T&E equipment;
networking of T&E and other facilities;
greater use of modelling and simulation;
greater co-operation with overseas Governments and industry.

###### Artifi cial T&E


B12.14 Laboratory analysis, experimentation, simulation and modelling
are playing an increasingly important role in T&E activities. For example,
the NITEworks experimentation capability will drive improvements in the
way MOD and industry work together to develop military capability. Whilst
the increasing reliance on these activities will undoubtedly reduce the need
to conduct physical equipment and system testing it is not necessarily a
complete panacea. There may be a shift in the balance between laboratory
and physical testing, however specialist and dedicated T&E ranges, facilities
and supporting personnel will still be required. The challenge is to ensure
that the optimum mix is delivered and, more importantly, sustained.

###### T&E next steps


###### Conclusion

B12.17 In some cases a UK based T&E capability is essential for,
amongst other things, certain quality assurance, safety or operational
security needs and sovereignty of access. In other cases the important
element is to retain the ability to direct, understand, analyse and
verify T&E results rather than actually conduct testing on-shore,
subject to certain safeguards including security of supply.


B12.18 We will work with industry to identify where such distinctions
can be safely made based on the principle that facilities are retained for
defence capability purposes. The current strategic intent in the medium
term is to retain T&E capability within the UK, but look for overseas cooperation where appropriate. The EDA work may lead, in due course, to
a longer-term strategy to consolidate T&E capabilities across Europe.


B12.15 Work is already underway to capture our long-term needs to
support future defence acquisitions. This includes work to review both
our Air T&E capabilities, routine fi ve-yearly review of the LTPA capability
requirements, and also includes an initiative, started by the European
Defence Agency (EDA) and supported by national representatives, to analyse
and propose ‘rationalisation’ of the European Defence T&E Base. The UK,
amongst other nations, has been at the forefront of this process and is keen
to include Government and commercial T&E capabilities into the analysis.

B12.16 Where our analysis identifi es areas of T&E duplication, principally
within the UK but also in the international arena, we will need to work
with industry to understand the reasons for duplication and if necessary
undertake any relevant rationalisation to ensure continued value for
money for the taxpayer, whilst maintaining defence capability.

In July 2000 NITEworks was established to provide an integration
and experimental environment to assess the benefi ts of Network
Enabled Capability (NEC) and the options for its eff ective and timely
delivery. NITEworks is one of the key means of carrying NEC from ideas
to delivery. This is achieved through experimentation in a simulated
battlespace to identify the benefi ts of NEC and the practical steps we
can take to deliver improved capability to the front line. NITEworks
operates as a unique MOD-industry partnership which sees customers
and suppliers working together to realise the potential of NEC.

###### Taking forward the DIS - the challenges for change
### C1


C1.1 The DIS presents real and urgent challenges to the way in
which the Department conducts the business of defence acquisition
in future. If we are to step up to those challenges and translate the
strategic intent into a reality, we must acknowledge the need to change.
The strategy will not deliver unless the defence acquisition community
as a whole, including industry as well as MOD, make the essential
transformation in our behaviours, organisations and business processes.

C1.2 Our Smart Acquisition initiative has delivered signifi cant benefi ts
for Defence in the form of improved performance and delivery of aff ordable,
battle winning capability to the Front Line. The basic principles of Smart
Acquisition still hold true and existing change programmes throughout
the Department provide a solid foundation on which to build.


###### Taking forward the DIS - the challenges for change
### C1


risk and performance management, and tailoring our procurement
approach to the needs of individual acquisition programmes.

C1.4 The nature of acquisition is evolving and we face an increasingly
demanding and complex environment. Closer collaborative engagement
between us and our industrial suppliers will be vital if we are to continue
to deliver the improvements that the Armed Forces and UK taxpayers
demand. The increasing pace of technological change, linked to a demand
for delivery of projects that combine new equipment with other elements
such as through-life support and training as an integrated capability present
challenges that both the Department and industry must face together.


C1.5 Our future approach to acquisition will therefore
be built around the objective of achieving:

primacy of through life considerations.
coherence of defence spend across research
development, procurement and support.
successful management of acquisition at the departmental level.


‘There has been further progress on measures to improve
performance within the Defence Procurement Agency and
elsewhere in the Department. These improvements focus on
the following areas: performance of key suppliers; the skills and
development of staff ; project and risk management; increased
use of trade-off s between time, cost and capability of equipment;
better joint working of those responsible for acquisition within
the Department; and stronger project scrutiny at all levels’.

**National Audit Offi ce Report – Major P rojects**
**Report 2005, HC595-1, Session 2005-06**


C1.6 Taken together these objectives will form the basis
of our acquisition reform programme, and our response to the
challenges of the DIS. We intend to build on our achievements to
date - consolidating success and embedding best practice – but also
recognising that we need to drive reform where it is needed.

###### Our Values for Defence Acquisition


C1.3 We must address the remaining challenges across the
Department of embedding a through-life systems approach, achieving
a better and more transparent relationship with industry, improving

C1.7 Successful acquisition depends not just on getting our strategy,
organisation and management processes right. We must ensure the
fundamental enablers are right, such as the cultural environment in
which we do business, the values and behaviours to which we adhere.


###### C1


-----

###### Defence Values for Acquisition   

**Defending the United Kingdom and its interests**

**Strengthening international peace and stability**

###### A FORCE FOR GOOD IN THE WORLD

**We achieve this aim by working together on our core task to produce**
**battle-winning people and equipment that are:**

fi t for the challenge of today;
ready for the tasks of tomorrow;
capable of building for the future;

**Our defence values for acquisition**

By working together across all the Lines of Development, we will deliver the right equipment and services
fi t for the purpose required by the customer, at the right time and the right cost.

In delivering this Vision in Acquisition, we all must:

recognise that people are the key to our success; equip them with the right skills, experience and professional qualifi cations;
recognise the best can be the enemy of the very good; distinguish between must have, desirable, and nice to have if aff ordable;
**identify trade off s between performance, time and cost; cases for additional resources must off er realistic alternative solutions;**
**never assume additional resources will be available; cost growth on one project can only mean less for others and for the front line;**
**understand that time matters; slippage costs – through running on legacy equipment, extended project timescales, and damage to our**
reputation;

**think incrementally; seek out agile solutions with open architecture which permit “plug and play”; allow space for innovation and the**
application of best practice;

**quantify risk and reduce it by placing it where it can be managed most eff ectively; stopping a project before Main Gate can be a sign of**
maturity;

**recognise and respect the contribution made by industry; seek to share objectives, risks and rewards while recognising that diff erent**
drivers apply;

**value openness and transparency; share future plans and priorities wherever possible to encourage focused investment and avoid wasted**
eff ort;

**embed a through life culture in all planning and decision making;**
**value objectivity based on clear evidence rather than advocacy; ensure that we capture past experience and allow it to shape our future**
behaviour;
realise that success and failure matter; we will hold people to account for their performance.


C1.8 In October 2005, we announced a core set of defence values
for acquisition which build on our Defence Vision to shape the behaviour
of all those involved in acquisition, including: Ministers, the Defence
Management Board, customers at all levels, the scrutiny community,
project teams in the delivery organisations and private sector partners.

C1.9 We will embed these values for acquisition in our
partnering arrangements through clear leadership at all levels by:

ensuring all key acquisition decisions refer explicitly to
how they reinforce and demonstrate these values;

refl ecting these values in our acquisition personnel
objective setting and reward structures;

embedding these values in our core acquisition guidance
documents and education programmes; and
using these values as the basis of the way we
develop our future relationship with industry.


###### Achieving the gold standard

C1.10 The recent Value For Money report from the National Audit
Offi ce[1] identifi ed several examples of ‘Gold Standard’ performance in
our projects “with a number at the very forefront of good project
**control”, against a benchmark of worldwide best practice in other**
sectors. In setting out our agenda for change, we must take the whole
of the Department forward on a broad front, embedding best practice
in everything we do. We set out below our priority areas for action
and the steps we will take to achieve the changes we are seeking.

###### Through life relationships with industry

C1.11 Defence acquisition must be able to adapt to the increasing
uncertainty in our external environment and the future operational

requirements; programmes that are increasingly complex, of higher
value and higher risk; a greater drive for innovation and continuing
cost improvement, and models of product and service delivery that
are more through-life and long term in nature. Relationships between
Department and industry that are purely transactional and conducted
at arms-length will struggle to meet these challenges. Increasingly
they demand the use of a diff erent style of relationship.


‘Successful working relationships are characterised by soft factors such
as team working, trust and honesty. When the Department and its
industry partners on a project display these behaviours they are more
likely to develop a common understanding of the task, the progress
being made and give early warning of problems. When a project
operates in a supportive and open corporate environment the other
parts of the project’s own organisation, such as senior management,
are more likely to have timely and accurate information about the
status of the project to enable them to make sensible decisions.’

**National Audit Offi ce – Driving the successful delivery**
**of major projects, HC30 Session 2005-06**


C1.12 The emphasis on our future approach to ensuring value for money
has highlighted the need to place greater emphasis on fostering better, and
where appropriate, longer term relationships with our key suppliers, and
the use of appropriate commercial tools, including competition of formal
parnering agreements. This must be underpinned by greater openness
and transparency, with a common and more explicit understanding of
how to achieve best value for both Defence and industry. While there
are examples of good practice in fostering good relationships, including
in Defence Estates, these are not as widespread as they should be.

C1.13 ‘Partnering’ defi nes how the parties conduct themselves
and the working attitudes that are valued. While it can describe a
legal framework of partnership, the basic ethos and the associated
behaviours are not restricted to any particular method of contracting.


C1.14 Learning the requisite behaviours and skills, as well as other
professional procurement competencies, takes time and experience. We
recognise that it will be some time before all our acquisition specialists are
able to demonstrate signifi cant experience of practising these partnering
behaviours. We are committed to retraining and developing our people
to develop the competencies required, and will encourage individuals
to plan their careers with a view to preparing them for such positions.
Nevertheless, we recognise that in the short term we may not be able
to fi nd internally all the individuals we require who have or can develop
quickly the requisite skills and experience, and would therefore need to
recruit externally. To ensure that we maintain a vibrant, highly skilled
acquisition community in the department in the longer term we will
also, in line with the Professional Skills in Government agenda, actively
encourage continued movement between the Department and Industry.

C1.15 The business environment to which we aspire is one in which there is:


###### C1


a relationship which is less ‘adversarial’ in style, based on a mutual
understanding of where the motivations and interests of each party
lie, acknowledging and managing the areas of diff erence and tension;

a willingness to share information with industry in a spirit of
openness and transparency at all levels. This must begin from the
earliest stages of the project lifecycle, involving industry more

Whilst MRMS is a relatively
new concept, exemplifi ed by
the benefi ts fl owing from the
support solution for the RB199
engine in the RAF’s Tornado
aircraft, which in a pilot contract
delivered 30% cash savings
whilst improving engine
availability, it builds on a track
record of previous successful
innovation. The successful Total
Support Programme for the
Spey 250 engine in Nimrod
R1/MR2 led the way. Under
this arrangement, average
engine on-wing time has more
than doubled, unplanned
rejections have been reduced by
50% and spares consumption
has reduced by over 20%.

The achievement of these innovative support solutions has been based
on the establishment of a joint Rolls-Royce/DLO team, working within
a partnering arrangement. The arrangement included developing a
jointly owned through-life cost model, shared assumptions database,
joint risk register and an integrated cost reduction programme
involving Rolls-Royce, its supply chain, the DLO and Strike Command.

By fi rst clearly understanding the desired outcomes of all parties,
a contracting model was developed which has established
eff ective performance-based incentives for reducing the
through-life cost of RB199, not least by applying Lean Support
Principles to maximise total support eff ectiveness.

This innovative approach has relied on the adoption of entirely
diff erent behaviours by industry and the MOD, which have
been characterised by a change in leadership style and colocation to achieve successful joint team working, based on
shared information and aligned business objectives.

an ethos that encourages potential problems to be brought to light
early, with eff ective mechanisms for the timely resolution;


-----

more widespread use of ‘partnering arrangements’[2] in our
contracting relationships where appropriate; having explicit
codes of practice and behaviour that are actively managed;

relationships between MOD, industry and others that
encourage innovation and facilitate the insertion of new
technologies and upgrades into military capabilities. In some
areas this will require greater understanding and management
of the critical points in the industrial supply chain.

C1.16 We will therefore:

place a greater emphasis on joint team behaviours
**and relationship management as part of the core**
**business of all our acquisition. This will include**
developing project teams which have the tools, skills and
expertise to facilitate more eff ective relationships;

**create a new Defence Commercial Director post in the**
**centre of the Department with a pan-Defence strategic**
**outlook. This appointment has already been advertised. The post**
holder will be responsible for driving forward the commercial
aspects of the Defence Industrial Strategy and, in particular,
for developing partnering arrangements with industry that
embed the right behaviours and incentives for both parties;

**place greater emphasis on partnering behaviours, the**
importance of partnering arrangements, and the ability to foster
eff ective relationships, in our supplier selection decisions;

invest increased resource and commitment into driving
**forward the Key Supplier Management initiative**
to deliver a framework that will improve and develop our
knowledge, understanding, and relationships with key suppliers
throughout the supply chain focusing on mutually benefi cial
improvements in decision making and performance, while
also improving risk management across our portfolio;

**improve commercial awareness and the understanding**
**of industry for our acquisition staff at all levels. This**
will include a greater use of joint training and development,
and creating more opportunities for short, focused exchanges
of staff between the Department and industry;

**ensure greater collaboration between defence, industry and**
the universities in the fi elds of science, technology and engineering.
We will develop the supplier base by building on our existing
plans to compete more of the research programme and forming
partnerships between government, industry and universities;

**publish a guide, intended for an industry audience,**
making it clear whom within our acquisition organisations has
the lead responsibility and can speak authoritatively on particular
subjects. This guide will be published electronically and will
be updated through the Acquisition Management System.

**Defence Estates Supplier Association**

Defence Estates (DE), through the adoption of Prime Contracting,
has generated a major rationalisation of the traditional property
management and core works contracts, reducing them from
over 200 into 5 regional based medium term contracts of
between 7 and 10 years duration. A signifi cant proportion of
DE’s business is or will be contracted out to a much-reduced
number of suppliers for the medium to long term.

As part of DE’s Supplier Management strategy we aim to improve
the overall working relationship with key suppliers following
this move to longer, high value contracts. We believe that the
Supplier Association format provides us with a formal structure
through which we can achieve this objective. The associations
are intended to be inclusive and a ‘joint’ initiative, therefore
cannot work without the commitment of DE’s key suppliers.

DE organised workshops with its suppliers during November 2005
to launch the Supplier Associations and are confi dent that by
early 2006 the associations will be fully established and will have
identifi ed specifi c areas on which DE can work collaboratively with
its suppliers, in order to generate tangible outputs and effi ciencies.


###### Delivery of integrated solutions

C1.17 We will continue to promote adoption of a more integrated
approach to the delivery of military capability, through our focus on
Through Life Capability Management as the basis of all our acquisition
activities. While the principle of an empowered equipment capability
customer is now well embedded into our acquisition system, we need
to improve the synchronisation of other contributing defence Lines
of Development (see text box). The delivery of new and enhanced
military capability requires orchestrated action across complex
change programmes in addition to the equipment itself.

C1.20 We will take action to create a strong programme
**management environment around our projects that will:**

manage the overarching portfolio of projects within a
**capability area, including research and technology, capability**
upgrade and in-service capability in a coherent manner.
Programme teams will be accountable for the initiation and
execution of projects, working with suppliers to reduce the
likelihood of individual projects over-running and the impact
on the wider acquisition budget if this is unavoidable;


manage cross project issues; oversee the integration of
projects and other Lines of Development into military capability;
increase our capability to trade-off between performance,
time and cost; and provide a focal point for underpinning
industrial base issues and ensure coherent engagement with
the market. This will include an intelligent approach to the
structuring of the supply chain to maximise innovation and
nurture the necessary systems engineering capabilities;

act as overarching design authority for the capability
**area; to enable faster and cheaper capability upgrade;**
manage the insertion of new technologies and increments;
better focus on the pull-through of new technology; exploit
opportunities to reduce through-life costs by more coherent
management of the total portfolio of equipment and projects;


###### C1


C1.18 We have created a number of through-life IPTs with dual
accountability to the DPA and the DLO, to provide a cradle to grave approach
to equipment management. The DLO is already driving an end to end
through-life view of logistic support solutions that provides opportunities
and incentives for industry to align with our capability needs.

C1.19 There is much more that we still need to do, if we are to:


invest in developing programme management
**capabilities and competence within acquisition. This will**
ensure the availability of the key enablers defi ned by the OGC
for Successful Delivery Skills and Centres of Excellence.

C1.21 We will run Pathfi nder programmes to test and
de-risk this approach to capability programmes with close
involvement from industry in the areas concerned.

‘The Department should apply lessons from the procurement of
capabilities through Urgent Operational Requirements more widely,
for example fl exible procurement and rapid competition techniques.’

‘The single most impressive aspect of our study has been the massive
commitment by staff in the Department and in industry who, in times
of need, assume the task of delivering Urgent Operational Requirements
to the warfi ghter in addition to their normal ongoing duties.’

current and programmed Armoured Vehicles.


C1.26 There is also much that we can learn from our handling of Urgent
Operational Requirements, recognising the unique circumstances in which
they are generated and delivered. Nevertheless, such rapid procurements
are a testament to the dedication and ability of our acquisition community
in times of crisis, and show a pragmatism and preparedness to trade
performance and make use of innovative contracting approaches.

C1.27 Alternative acquisition lifecycles, such as incremental
acquisition, are better suited to these challenges and allow for a staged
approach to the reduction and management of project risk. They also
off er fl exibility to enable the insertion of new technology and a rapid
response to evolving requirements and operational circumstances.


C1.22 The key features of the Pathfi nder programmes will be:

culture change through setting the right values and behaviours;

a programme approach to through-life capability management;

eff ective integration across all the Defence Lines of
Development to deliver sustainable military capability;

eff ective techniques for capability trade-off with early
industry engagement in capability analysis;

Defence/industry joint working to understand and address the
dynamics of the supply chain and sources of innovation.

C1.23 We are working up business cases for each of the Pathfi nders with the
intention that both programmes will launch in the fi rst half of 2006. We also
intend to capture lessons emerging from our FRC, SAM and Acquisition for NEC
programmes as a means of identifying best practice in programme management.

C1.24 Work is also underway to assess the application of programme
management approaches to the departmental Information Systems portfolio,
and to consider the need for clear end-to-end ownership of the processes
used for the delivery of the Command Information Systems within MOD.

###### Innovation, agility and fl exibility

C1.25 We must be able to respond to the rapidly changing strategic
and operational environment by adapting current and future capabilities
exploiting the opportunities off ered by technology innovation. We must
remain alive to developments in the commercial market, particularly in the
fi elds of information and communication technologies that are evolving at a
h i h bili f d


C1.28 To inform and support such alternative acquisition lifecycles
we will require new models and analysis that enhance our ability to:

understand how capability and technology
combine to deliver us the military eff ect;

develop clear options for consideration;

conduct balance of investment to inform decisions between
i i l f d bli


Faced with high levels of programme risk and a rapidly
developing technology base, the PICASSO project adopted
an incremental strategy, combined with the appointment of a
Prime Systems Integrator (PSI) and a Joint Project Offi ce.

The strategy has enabled the PICASSO team to deliver capability
in manageable programme increments, with assessment activity
conducted concurrently with the delivery of each increment. The
PSI is responsible for assessment, delivery and integration of future
increments and the through-life Operation & Maintenance of the
current and future capability. This approach has been eff ective
in mitigating the programme risk by giving the team the agility
to react to emerging issues and to trade performance, time and
cost for each increment based on changing requirements.

It has allowed MOD and industry to pool ideas and has promoted
a clearer understanding of how industry solutions can meet
MOD’s needs. This approach also gives MOD the opportunity to
direct industry to integrate known third party solutions into
legacy and new capability. Progress to date has been excellent
and the project is meeting its 10% confi dence level estimates.


-----

C1.29 We must also look to research and technology (R&T) to
provide more aff ordable and cost-eff ective capability. This must provide
a greater focus for our future programmes. Examples of where R&T
programmes have helped to address aff ordability issues include:

seeker research work on the Brimstone air-launched
anti-armour missile allowed savings of £15-20
million, and increased the capability.


Flight control research for the JSF, providing estimated cost
saving of £40 million for fi xed costs and £3.6 billion over
the next 30 years for a research cost of only £50 million.

**The Tornado F3 Sustainment Programme (FSP) is a**
collaborative project to upgrade the Tornado F3 to fi t AMRAAM
and ASRAAM missiles and to make improvements to the radar
and mission computer software. The project combines several
upgrades into a single, coherent package of work, delivered in
increments. The small joint team (comprising Tornado IPT, Fast
Jet and Weapons Operational Evaluation Unit, BAE Systems,
QinetiQ and the missile, radar and computer contractors) have
adopted concurrent engineering principles, strong teamwork and
simultaneous development, trials and operational evaluation.

This has reduced the projected time (by 50%) and cost (by 30%) as well
as allowing front line views to be incorporated early in the development
process. Already at the midpoint, the programme has proven resilient
in the face of a number of technical problems but has still achieved
all of its stretch milestones. This approach is being broadened into the
Tornado Capability Development and Sustainment Service to accelerate
the introduction of new technology onto the Tornado GR4 from 2010
to 2007; this opens up the architecture of the aircraft to make future
technology insertion easier and hence reduce whole-life costs.

C1.30 We will seek to realise the value of innovation by exploiting
it better in new equipment or new processes, including a greater
emphasis on the development of demonstrators[3]. These off er major
benefi ts by providing a means to challenge conventional views on
system solutions and off ering early risk reduction. We will also improve
the planning of research exploitation, and to use this to inform funding
decisions. This will help the MOD and industry allocate funding and align
equipment and the supporting R&T programmes.


C1.31 Adoption of open system architectural principles can assist in
developing modular solutions that maximise the opportunities for technology
insertion, as well as promoting innovation and competition within the
supply chain. These principles ensure the equipment design process
employs declared, common standards, interfaces and supporting formats.

C1.32 There is further scope to exploit synthetic environment
approaches and the use of experimentation techniques involving the
end user. These techniques can also be used to capture and refi ne
requirements; identify and de-risk the fi nal solution; ensure all Lines
of Development have been addressed; and support an end to end
perspective on the key integration and interoperability issues.


C1.33 Exploitation of e-procurement techniques off ers the potential
to further streamline the acquisition process, reduce bureaucracy and
promote an eff ective collaborative working environment with industry. This
applies to the procurement of commodity items, the acceleration of bidding
and tendering, and support to virtual teams working with industry. Eprocurement does not just replace paper transactions. It transforms business
processes and fosters more eff ective trading partnerships with our suppliers.


###### C1


_3_ _Th M_ _fD f_ _R_ _h_ _dT h l_ _P_ _4NAOR_ _M_ _h2004_


-----

C1.34 The major enabler for e-procurement is already in place. The
Defence Electronic Commerce Service provides the principal portal for
e-business transactions between the Department and its trading partners.
Suppliers already trading through this route have identifi ed a number of key
benefi ts including: less paperwork and administration; quicker payment;
greater competitive advantage through reduction in inventory holdings;
direct supply to the customer and greater control of the supply chain.

C1.35 We will take action to make our acquisition approach
**more innovative, agile and fl exible at the project level, by:**

**streamlining decision making, recognising**
that delays in decision-making have a cost;

**fully exploiting the potential of e-procurement,**
throughout the MOD acquisition organisations;

**rebalancing our governance arrangements**
towards a greater emphasis on assurance that risk is
progressively reduced through the life of the project;

recognising that being prepared to cancel projects, if necessary
**before Main Gate, is a necessary part of a healthy acquisition**
**system recognising the impact this may have on bidders;**

**increasing the tempo of procurement; matching to the underlying**
speed of technology change and changing operational needs, moving
to the presumption that all projects should use more fl exible
**approaches (such as incremental or evolutionary acquisition);**

**systematically reviewing the procurement strategies for**
our existing pre-Main Gate project population to identify
potential benefi ts and opportunities for improved delivery
through a more fl exible approach to acquisition;

**developing an improved approach to technology insertion,**
allowing us to ‘plug and play’ new technologies more easily into our
major systems and platforms, maintaining a capability edge and
ensuring interoperability with high technology allies such as the US
and France. Specifi cally, working with industry to identify innovative
best practice and benchmark UK performance against other nations
for cost eff ective technology insertion by the end of 2006;

**working with industry and universities to identify**
**national sources of innovation and where the important**
technologies we need are:

improving the pull-through of technology from research
**into capabilities; increased technology scanning to identify**
potential opportunities and threats, and the funding and
focus of technology and capability demonstrators;

exploiting synthetic environment and experimentation
approaches to reduce risk and facilitate early engagement
of the operational customer in system design.

###### Consistency in our approach

C1.36 Empowered and accountable Integrated Project Teams remain
a core principle of how we conduct acquisition. But some of our project
teams behave inconsistently and may fail to follow best practice.
Empowerment can also result in approaches that are eff ective at project
l l b hi h b i h b ll d f i


C1.37 We will take action to create a consistent and
**clearly defi ned operating framework for how we conduct,**
**govern and control our projects. This framework will:**

embed the Defence Values for Acquisition
throughout the organisation;

establish a strong and professional ‘doctrine’ for how
the Department conducts its acquisition business;

reduce the burden of compliance and governance and improve
the speed and responsiveness of our decision-making;

be underpinned by a set of obligations that clearly articulate
what customers, suppliers and other stakeholders can expect
in their dealings with the acquisition organisations.

C1.38 The DPA intends to review and clarify its operating framework
during 2006, working in conjunction with the other areas of acquisition
to ensure consistency and alignment. The DLO Procurement Reform and
Category Management initiatives have also made progress in promoting
greater coherence and consistency among their logistics teams. We will work
across the acquisition community as a whole to exploit opportunities for
improved joint working and commonality of approach, including reviewing
and streamlining the Acquisition Management System to ensure that content
is relevant, authoritative and readily accessible to practitioners. Together
with the Defence Values for Acquisition, and the Acquisition Handbook,
this will form a coherent and readily accessible suite of guidance.


C1.39 We will implement the OGC Commerce Project and Programme
management ‘Centre of Excellence’ model to ensure that we:

continue to drive toward the NAO ‘Gold Standard’, and
toward best in class professional procurement practices in
public and private sector organisations world-wide;

fully integrate risk management into our project management
approach;

identify and progressively implement a set of best
in class project control and reporting tools.

C1.40 We will also embed improved joint working between the
DPA and DLO exploiting opportunities for improved alignment,
commonality of approach and economy of eff ort. These include:

continuing to launch through-life IPTs;

rationalising the provision of enabling services that

‘Top team oversight of major programmes is critical to success. IPPD
recommends that departments establish a centre of excellence,
combining the roles of programme offi ce and departmental capacity/

Boards and Ministers have the systems and data they need to prioritise,
monitor delivery, and balance risk against departmental capability.’

from experience across the acquisition community.

###### Professional delivery skills


C1.41 We must ensure that the appropriate training, development
and professional standards are in place for all those involved in
acquisition, and that staff receive due reward and recognition for
their competence and for their achievements in project delivery.

C1.42 The Acquisition Leadership Development Scheme is key to
achieving this and provides a clear career anchor and development
structure for acquisition professionals. There are currently some
664 members. Senior leaders in their respective professional fi elds
have been identifi ed as development partners to: determine the
future skills needs; develop and advise on career paths; and inspire
individuals to acquire the skills the acquisition community requires.


Acquisition Values. This will include looking to new approaches
to recruitment, pay and grading, and reward, to attract, develop
and retain people with the right skills. We must also ensure that
our most challenging projects attract, and are led by our very
best, and that we grow people for those roles through the course
of their careers. Individual and team achievements in project
delivery must also be appropriately recognised and rewarded. An
evaluation of current initiatives will be undertaken with the Project
Delivery Skills Programme and completed by October 2006;

make increased use of professional accreditation
**schemes for engineers, project management, fi nance and**
commercial staff in our professional acquisition streams;


co-ordinate the eff ort on Professional Delivery Skills with the action
to improve the Science and Technology skills base within
Defence;

**increase investment in systems engineering skills**
and training in the Department and in industry.


C1.43 Current initiatives in this area include:

a MSc in Defence Acquisition Management
launched by the Defence academy;


a Business Graduate Development Scheme providing
acquisition teams with a new pool of high calibre
professional commercial managers;

graduate recruitment schemes to enhance critical skills
in project management, engineering and fi nance.


**place greater emphasis on staff continuity in**
**delivering projects. The tenure of staff in key posts must**
ensure greater continuity of responsibility, and relationships
across critical phases and events in the project life.


C1.44 The Civilian Workforce Plan for 2005 describes our overall strategy
for our civilian workforce and will enable us to maximise our pool of talent
and match people and skills to the demands of the job. This places a high
priority on programme and project management skills and on ensuring
that our recruitment, reward and recognition practices deliver people in
the numbers we need with the necessary skills and motivation. We will:

**address the shortages in Project Delivery Skills within the**
department through a programme to address critical shortages of
project and programme management and acquisition leadership
skills. This will include key milestones to be achieved by April 2006;


C1.45 We are also committed to seeking ways to exploit
delivery and project management skills in industry. We will:

**work more closely with industry in developing acquisition**
**skills and professionalism. This will include reinvigorating the**
joint working initiatives on human resources issues, including
joint learning events, shared development opportunities, short
and focused interchange opportunities for acquisition staff,
and more joint education through the Defence Academy;


**explore alternative models for independent**
**project management of major projects. We will pilot**
this approach on two acquisition programmes.

###### Moving forward


improve our recruitment, reward and recognition practices
to deliver acquisition staff of the number and quality we need
and whose behaviour demonstrates their commitment to our


C1.46 This section has set out an ambitious and challenging change
agenda that will require committed and visible leadership within the
Department. We intend to drive hard to realise the benefi ts as soon as


###### C1


-----

possible, recognising that it will be some time before results are fully visible
externally. This change agenda will be led and driven by the Acquisition
Policy Board (APB) which will regularly review progress and ensure change
activities are adequately resourced and supported across the Department.

C1.47 We have created a Directorate of Defence Acquisition responsible to
the APB for coordinating this programme of change, tracking and capturing
benefi ts, and ensuring that obstacles are recognised and addressed.

C1.48 All of this will be necessary if we are to improve our acquisition
performance. But we recognise that it may not be suffi cient. We need better
to understand where our current processes, structures and organisation
support, encourage, hinder or obstruct our ability to achieve the objectives
of this change programme, and to address the obstacles of the DIS.

C1.49 We will appoint a senior offi cial to review our current acquisition
construct and make recommendations for change where needed. This
individual will report directly to the Permanent Under Secretary and, through
him, to the APB. They will have a clear remit to range across the whole of
the Department’s business and be encouraged to take a broad view of the
acquisition process. They will report progress to the APB on a regular basis,
with fi nal recommendations by May 2006 for early implementation.

###### The challenge to industry

C1.50 The Department is committed to driving this change agenda.
We will be looking for parallel commitment from industry to:

plan more eff ectively and jointly for the long term,
embracing the vision of through life capability management
so as to focus on meeting our requirements in the
most cost-eff ective way in whole-life terms;

invest in growing and maintaining a high-quality
systems engineering capability within the UK, at all
levels in the supply chain where we need key systems
and sub-systems to be designed and engineered;

join us in our eff orts to promote greater interaction and
collaboration between Defence, industry and the universities to
stimulate innovation in science, technology and engineering;

embrace the use of open systems architectural principles
and incremental acquisition principles throughout
the supply chain, and help us to fi nd more costeff ective approaches to technology insertion;

work jointly to foster better understanding of each others’ objectives
and business processes, including a greater commitment to joint
education, staff development and interchange opportunities;

promote the use of partnering behaviours in industry’s
interface with the Department at all levels, so as to encourage
trust, openness, transparency and communication.

###### Getting down to work - putting the DIS into action
### C2


C2.1 The Defence Industrial Strategy sets out a comprehensive
agenda for change, both in how we approach and interact with the
market place in several areas and in how we and industry behave and
are organised. Much eff ort has been expended – within the MOD,
across Government and in industry – in putting it together.

C2.2 But all this will be for nothing unless Government and industry are
prepared to work together to address the real challenges that we face if we
are both to maintain the industrial capabilities and technological skills that we
require in order to maintain the operational capability of our Armed Forces in
a manner that is attractive in a business sense. For instance, we and industry
agree that in general we must gain a much deeper understanding of the supply
chains for defence; this will require signifi cant, ongoing work on a number
of fronts. In that sense, the publication of the DIS is the start, rather than the
end, of a process. Its detailed implementation is the hard work to come.

**jet combat aircraft through-life. We aim on working with**
the company during 2006 to agree the way ahead – which will
be challenging given the scope of the scale of the transformation
that is required – and to implement it from 2007. In parallel and
contributing to these eff orts, subject to value for money being
demonstrated and appropriate commercial arrangements being put
in place, we intend to move ahead with a substantial Uninhabited
Aerial Vehicle Technology Demonstrator Programme in 2006;

implementing measures that build confi dence on both sides.
We intend to establish a joint partnering team within the early
part of 2006 and to establish a business transformation plan
underpinned by a robust milestone and performance regime.
The plan will detail the improvements in performance to be
achieved, the process and behavioural changes required of
both BAE Systems and the Department, and the capabilities
and skills necessary to sustain through life support to AFVs;


C2.3 We recognise this, and the importance of making the DIS more
than simply words. For our part, we are committed to work with industry
to take forward the work identifi ed as being required in the various sector
strategies. To that end we attach real importance in the short term to:

in the maritime sector, building on the close joint working
that has been in hand for some months to develop a maritime
industrial strategy. To this effect we will immediately start
**negotiations with the key companies that make up**
**the submarine supply chain to achieve a programme level**
partnering agreement with a single industrial entity for the
full lifecycle of the submarine flotilla, while addressing key
affordability issues. The objective is to achieve this agreement
in time for the award of the contract for the fourth and
subsequent Astute class submarines. This will be matched
by the implementation of a unified submarine programme
management organisation within the MOD. For surface ship
**design and build, we aim within the next six months**
**to arrive at a common understanding of the core load**
**required to sustain the high-end design, systems engineering**
and combat systems integration skills that we have identified
as being important. We expect industry to begin restructuring
itself to improve its performance and shall build on the
momentum generated by the industrial arrangements being
put together on the CVF programme to drive restructuring to
meet both the CVF peak and the reduced post-CVF demand.
**For surface ship support, we will start immediate**
**negotiations with the industry with the aim of exploring**
**alternative contracting arrangements and the way**
**ahead for contracting the next upkeep periods, which**
**start in the autumn of next year. Key maritime equipment**
industrial capabilities will be supported by the production of a

months, been exploring partnering opportunities across those
areas of the business indicated in the Heads of Agreement. We
**hope that by the Spring 2006, subject to value for money**
having been demonstrated, we will have reached agreement
**on a Strategic Partnering Arrangement (SPA) which will be**
focused on activities to sustain the design engineering skills and
knowledge of UK military demands and safety standards within
the company necessary for them to provide eff ective throughlife support to those elements of the in-service helicopter fl eet
for which they are the design authority. The SPA is intended to
commit both parties to specifi c targets on, inter alia, cost and
schedule adherence (and where appropriate improvement) and
improvements in operational availability; it will be underpinned
by a Business Transformation Plan that sets out the process and
behavioural changes required both in MOD and AgustaWestland;

for complex weapons, establishing a multi-disciplinary team charged
**with working with all elements of the onshore industry**
**to establish how we might together seek both to meet**
**our ongoing requirements and sustain in an industrially**
**viable manner the critical guided weapons technologies**
**and through life support capabilities that we judge to be**
**so important to our operational sovereignty. Given the**
transnational nature of the industrial players, this dialogue will
need also to engage our allies and partners, particularly in Europe.

intention is that we should have a clearer way ahead by mid-2006;

for general munitions, taking forward Project MASS, with a view to
making decisions on how best to sustain our required access
**to general munitions in the summer of next year, building**
on the joint working arrangements enshrined in the existing
Framework Partnering Agreement as reinforced by the recently
agreed MOD/BAE Systems LS partnering principles. We are also
actively pursuing partnering arrangements with other suppliers.

C2.5 In addition to this sector specifi c work, we will also
work to give eff ect to the conclusions identifi ed with respect
to science and technology. Specifi cally, we will:

**review the alignment of our research programme with**
**MOD needs and the needs of the defence industry, with a view**
to improving the alignment, quality and military exploitation
of the research programme. This work is encompassed in the
ongoing MOD Science and Technology Capability and Alignment
Study and will be published by Summer 2006; it will be repeated
every two years in concert with the biennial planning process;

conduct further work better to understand the underpinning
**technologies that the UK must have for security and sovereignty**
reasons, where the UK is strong and where we need to focus our
R&T eff orts. We hope this will be completed by Autumn 2006;

by mid-2006 update our Defence Technology Strategy to
refl ect the conclusions of the DIS and this related work. We will
engage the R&T sub-group of the NDIC in this endeavour;

develop a better understanding of the innovation process
and map out the technology trees for major capabilities,
systems and platforms in a report, which we aim to produce
by the Autumn of 2006. We will work with the R&T sub-group
of the NDIC to identify sources of technology and innovation
throughout the supply chain and ensure that relevant
technologies are pulled through into military capability.

C2.6 More broadly, we will place real eff ort and priority on driving
**forward the programme of cultural, behavioural, procedural**
**and where necessary organisational change set out in Chapter**
C1. Our priorities for acquisition improvement are: partnering and
relationships with industry, through-life; delivery of integrated
solutions; agility and fl exibility in projects; consistency in our approach;
and professional delivery skills. Specifi cally, in the near term we:

will work with industry to develop, roll out and implement a
joint plan for embedding the Defence Acquisition Values
**throughout the acquisition community. We expect to be**
**in a position to launch this within three months and will**
apply the real commitment of resource, time and eff ort that will
be required to eff ect lasting change through 2006 and beyond;

are currently scoping two Pathfi nders programmes to
**test and de-risk a programme approach to through-life**
**capability management with the intention that the Pathfi nder**
programme teams will launch in the fi rst half of 2006;

**will address the shortages in Project Delivery Skills within**
the Department by building on our existing Project Delivery Skills
Strategy to deliver an accelerated pan-Defence Project Delivery Skills
h ill id if d fill h i i l i i l


in the areas of project and programme management and acquisition
leadership. Key milestones are to be achieved by April 2006;

will ensure that our recruitment, reward and recognition
practices deliver acquisition staff of the quality we need in the
numbers required whose behaviour demonstrates their commitment
to our Defence Values for Acquisition. An evaluation of current
incentivisation initiatives will be completed by October 2006;

will establish a strong and professional operating framework
**for how the Department conducts its acquisition business.**
Under the DPA Forward programme, the DPA will be piloting the
operating framework during 2006, working in conjunction with the
other areas of acquisition to ensure consistency and alignment;

will review – so that we are in a position to make
**judgements about this by May 2006 – the extent to**
**which the current process and organisational construct**
**supports, encourages, hinders or obstructs the delivery**
**of excellence in acquisition. This would allow us to commit**
to changes that are required this side of the summer recess;

are looking forward to discussing further with industry
**– in the fi rst instance through the commercial policy**
**sub-group of the NDIC early in the New Year – our ideas**
**about alternatives to competition as a means where**
appropriate of assessing value for money, with a view to
developing a concrete action plan for taking them forward;

will start with immediate eff ect, to deliver on our
**revised policy of providing industry with a better and**
**longer term understanding of our future plans.**

C2.7 We will ke ep the progress of this work, and the extent to which real
change is being demonstrated on the ground, under review within the MOD,
through the Acquisition Policy Board reporting to the Minister for Defence
Procurement.  We will want formally to review progress with the NDIC regularly,
and intend to off er the NDIC a detailed plan at its next meeting.

C2.8 This is an ambitious and demanding programme of concurrent
activities aimed at delivering a step-change improvement in acquisition
performance, underpinned by improved relationships between the MOD
and its suppliers and enhanced confi dence in our ability to sustain the
core industrial capabilities, technologies and skills that are required
to allow us eff ectively and in an appropriately sovereign manner, to
operate our Armed Forces. We are committed to making it work and
to investing the time, eff ort and resources to ensure that it does.

C2.9 We recognise that this will require tough decisions along the way;
we shall not shirk them. We look to industry to rise to the challenge with
us, recognising the opportunities for future prosperity that will ensue. The
nation’s Armed Forces, and indeed the nation’s interests, require nothing less.
