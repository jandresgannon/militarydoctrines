_Approved by the Latvian Cabinet of Ministers on 20 May 2008_
_Accepted by the Latvian Saeima (Parliament) on 19 June 2008._

**The State Defence Concept**

**1. Introduction**

1. The State Defence Concept has been developed based on Article 29 of the National
Security Law, with the aim of outlining the fundamental strategic principles, priorities
and measures for ensuring national defence. It is prepared according to Latvia’s
geopolitical situation, national security and foreign policy objectives, and Latvia’s
commitments as a NATO and EU member state.

2. The concept is prepared taking into account the national security threat assessment and an
analysis of regional and international security developments, as well as documents
defining NATO and EU security and defence policy.

3. The concept provides guidelines for Latvian national defence task implementation and
National Armed Forces (hereinafter NAF) development.

**2. Latvia’s security and international security environment**

4. With accession to NATO and the EU Latvia has significantly strengthened its national
security and defence. The basis of Latvian national defence and security is strengthening
Latvia’s military capabilities, NATO’s collective defence principle and military
cooperation with allied nations in the context of NATO and the EU.

5. Latvia’s security is indivisible from the security of the other Baltic Sea region NATO and
EU member states and is fostered by close mutual cooperation. Military cooperation with
the Baltic States, the Nordic countries and the USA (which will continue to be an
important strategic partner for Latvia in the future) is important in providing security for
Latvia and the entire region. The European Security and Defence Policy also has an
important role in the international security environment and is an important element in
strengthening Latvia’s security and defence.

6. Uncertainty in the domestic and foreign policies of individual countries could negatively
affect the security of Latvia and its allies and must be taken into account when
implementing national defence policy. A possible shift in the balance of power in
international relations triggered by individual countries’ rapid economic development,
competition over natural resources, trends in increasing armament and attempts to regain
influence in global politics, poses a significant security risk.

7. The security of Latvia and other NATO and EU member states is affected by
developments and challenges in the international security environment – international
terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organised crime, instability in
various regions of the world, as well as the desire by individual countries to engage in
military rivalry.

8. The global nature of threats makes them difficult to anticipate as they do not originate
solely from state actors. The changing nature of global security challenges requires that
an effective system for ensuring security and defence must be based on the readiness to


-----

respond to all types of crisis situations in peacetime, during a state of emergency and in
war time.

**3. Ensuring national defence**

**_3.1. The key task of national defence_**

9. The principal task of Latvia’s national defence system is to guarantee the independence
of the state, its territorial integrity and the security of its population. In order to ensure
national security and defence most effectively, Latvia has joined NATO and the EU. To
respond to national threats quickly, an effective warning system and preventative
measures are required.

10. In the case of national threats, the NAF shall ensure the inviolability of Latvia’s territory,
territorial waters and air space in cooperation with allied armed forces. The NAF, in
collaboration with civilian state institutions, must be ready to receive allied armed forces
on Latvian soil.

11. The NAF shall provide support to state civilian institutions in preventing emergency
situations and dealing with their consequences. The involvement of the NAF in
performing these tasks contributes to the effective use of state resources and increases the
NAF’s preparedness.

**_3.2. The strategic principle of national defence_**

12. The strategic principle of Latvia’s national defence is participation in NATO’s collective
defence system – the task of which is defending its members against any type of military
threat. It is therefore in Latvia’s interests that NATO retain and develop its capabilities
and effectiveness, thereby also strengthening Latvia’s defence. To achieve this, it is
important for Latvia to strengthen its voice in NATO contributing actively to the
organization’s decision making and consultation process.

13. Basing its security on the collective defence system, Latvia is actively involved in
strengthening NATO capabilities and participates in NATO-led operations and in other
activities promoting security. Latvia’s NAF contributes to NATO military combat units
with a special focus on the NATO Response Force (hereinafter NRF). By participating in
the NRF, the NAF gains valuable experience allowing it to improve its combat
capabilities.

14. Latvian defence capability development is guided by NATO capability requirements
which are derived from the NATO Comprehensive Political Guidelines (which define
military capability requirements for member countries). Armed forces interoperability is
essential for Latvia’s successful participation in NATO. Interoperability facilitates
cooperation between armed forces units of NATO members in performing common tasks.

15. For the national defence system to effectively deal with military and non-military threats
it is important that all state institutions involved coordinate their activities and cooperate
in anticipating, planning, preventing and overcoming various threats. This contributes to
the effective use of national resources and a rapid response to every possible threat or its
consequences.

**4. Activities to ensure military defence**


-----

16. The basis of national military defence is the NAF, which ensures the inviolability of the
state’s territory, territorial waters and air space, participates in international military
operations, provides training for regular and reserve military personnel, and is involved in
responding to all sorts of national emergencies. In a national state of emergency the Bank
of Latvia Security unit is incorporated in the NAF and during war, both the Bank of
Latvia Security unit and the State Border Guard are incorporated in the NAF.

17. The NAF is being developed as a professionally trained, socially secured, well equipped
force with a balanced structure, tasks and funding, capable of adapting to various combat
and security situations and interoperable with NATO military units and EU Battlegroups.

18. Priority is given to developing those NAF combat capabilities which can be used for
fulfilling both national and collective defence tasks and which meet the following
requirements:

a. Effectiveness – the mobility of units, interoperability of military capabilities with allied
forces, readiness to operate in multinational military formations in a broad spectrum of
operations;
b. Deployability – the ability to generate, prepare and deploy units within Latvia and to
areas of international operations;
c. Sustainability – the readiness to sustain units and supply them with resources
throughout an operation;
d. Multi-functionality – the ability of units to perform tasks in all types of threat situations
both within Latvia and abroad;
e. Survivability – protection of units from the threat of weapons of mass destruction;
f. Information superiority – obtaining strategic and operational information rapidly and
using it in performing tasks.

19. The NAF performs national defence tasks with high combat readiness units in accordance
with national and collective defence plans. Lower level combat readiness units prepare
individual specialists and specialised sub-units for performing NAF tasks as required.

20. The NAF maintains a structure in which administrative functions are subordinate to
combat and combat support tasks.

21. The National Guard is a component of the NAF and is tasked with involving Latvia’s
citizens in the defence of the state’s territory and society. Within the national defence
system, the National Guard provides support to the regular force by developing
specialised capabilities. Within the collective defence system the National Guard
performs host nation support functions and participates in international operations.

22. To meet national defence requirements and to develop the necessary military capabilities,
the total number of personnel in the NAF shall not exceed 20000, of which 5800 are
professional service soldiers and the remainder are National Guard members and military
and civilian employees. The Parliament (Saeima) sets the maximum allowed number of
NAF personnel when approving the annual state budget.

23. In specific circumstances the Bank of Latvia Security unit and the State Border Guard
participate in national defence as per the National Armed Forces Law. In these instances,
the two structures are incorporated into the NAF and perform duties described in
legislation and policy planning documents.

24. The main directions for the NAF’s development are as follows:


-----

24.1. Professional military service:

24.1.1. Professional armed forces ensure the NAF's readiness for national and collective
defence with effective operational capabilities, high combat readiness and modern
technology.

24.1.2. Developing armed forces based on professional service it is crucial to recruit
appropriate personnel. In order to provide the NAF with the required number of personnel,
there must be a flexible, modern and efficient recruiting system. Strengthening the Youth
Guard movement and developing its activities encourages the recruitment of appropriate
personnel for military service.

24.1.3. In order to attract personnel and motivate them to serve in the NAF it is necessary to
develop a career planning system that encompasses a clearly understandable career path in
the NAF and is effective in filling NAF positions with the most suitable personnel.

24.1.4. To ensure the competitiveness of military service in the labour market, military
personnel must be adequately remunerated, provided with opportunities to improve their
professional knowledge, soldiers and their families must be provided with appropriate social
benefits, and conditions must be created for successful reintegration into civilian life after
completion of military service.

24.2. Up-to-date and task-specific equipment, armament, infrastructure and training:

24.2.1. Modern armament, equipment and weapons systems are essential for the development
and modernisation of the NAF. High quality training must be tailored to the technologies
employed. The procurement of modern armament and equipment aims at increasing the
combat capabilities of the armed forces and ensuring force protection.

24.2.2. The deployment, sustainment and training process for NAF units requires the
development of an appropriate multifunctional infrastructure.

24.2.3. Because the NAF is numerically small, equipment acquired for development and
modernisation must not require significant personnel resources to operate. These systems
must be effective for terrain surveillance, control and defence of air space and territorial
waters and allow the NAF to gain information superiority over adversaries.

24.2.4. Special equipment and appropriately trained personnel are required to develop the
NAF’s capability to provide support to civil authorities in various threat and emergency
situations in peacetime.

24.2.5. To ensure unit mobility within the territory of the state and transportation to areas of
operations in the long run, as well as sustainment in international operations for longer
periods of time, units must initially be generated with the minimum required combat support
and combat service support, increasing these capabilities gradually over time.

24.2.6. Training systems are being improved to increase the professionalism of the NAF so
that every soldier receives the knowledge and skills required for military service as well as
opportunities for professional development. Unit level field tactical exercises are conducted
as closely as possible to real combat situations.

24.3. Combat capabilities:

24.3.1. The NAF is working at developing combat capabilities which are sufficient for
ensuring the inviolability of Latvia’s territory, territorial waters and air space in case of a


-----

threat to the state. Simultaneously the NAF is improving its search and rescue capabilities
and the ability to provide support to state civil institutions in emergency situations.

24.3.2. One of the directions in development for the National Guard is to enhance its ability
to ensure national defence in cooperation with the regular forces up to the arrival of allied
armed forces and to provide host nation support to allied forces deploying on Latvian soil.

24.3.3. Given Latvia’s membership in NATO and the EU and involvement in strengthening
international security, Latvian soldiers must be prepared to participate in international
operations in geographically distant locations that differ from Latvia climatically, sociopolitically, economically and culturally. By participating in international operations, the NAF
gains operational experience, improves its combat service support systems and ability to
effectively cooperate with allied forces.

24.3.4. NAF development occurs according to the following NATO military capability
development guidelines:

a. Develop a modern command and control system and an effective and secure
information and communications system;
b. Increase the effectiveness of combat capabilities;
c. Improve defence against weapons of mass destruction;
d. Create a modern training infrastructure.

24.3.5. According to NATO policy, Latvia is striving to ensure that no less than 8 % of NAF
personnel are permanently deployed in areas of operations (a total of 450 soldiers). Not less
than 40 % of all NAF personnel must be prepared for participation in operations led by
NATO, the EU and other international organisations.

24.3.6. In the medium term, the NAF must ensure the ability to deploy and permanently
sustain one platoon-level unit in an area of operations 15 000 km from Latvia’s borders, one
company-level unit at a distance of 5 000 km, or two company-level units with integrated
combat support and combat service support capabilities at a distance of 3 000 km. In case of
necessity, the NAF must be ready to participate in the full spectrum of NATO-led operations
with one infantry battalion for up to six months without rotation or with subunits not
exceeding two infantry companies or equivalent sized subunits for up to six months with
rotation. The NAF Navy must improve their capabilities to participate in NATO-led
operations.

24.3.7. As part of a timely and effective warning system, intelligence, command, control and
information systems must be developed and their operational security ensured with a view to
achieving information superiority and the ability to activate these systems without delay,
according to predetermined objectives.

**5. Providing host nation support**

25. In order to fully ensure national defence, Latvia as the host nation must be able to receive
allied armed forces. The host nation support system must allow for the rapid entry and
deployment of allied armed forces and be based on planned, interoperable and integrated
procurement and logistics systems.

26. The host nation support system is important not only in the event of military threats but
also for dealing with the consequence of natural and manmade disasters as well as for
hosting international training. The NAF provides host nation support in close cooperation


-----

with civilian state institutions and private institutions which, depending on the level and
intensity of the threat, provide:

a. Implementation of fast and effective border crossing procedures;
b. Medical support;
c. Use of civil aviation and air fields, maritime transport fleets and ports, as well as
railways and their associated infrastructure;
d. Access to civil transport and other infrastructure required for deployment of
forces.

27. All responsible institutions must ensure the maintenance and mutual coordination of the
host nation support system in order to ensure the rapid deployment of allied forces in case
of necessity.

**6. Personnel reserve and mobilisation systems**

28. Given the transition to a professional armed forces, appropriate personnel reserve and
mobilisation systems must be developed and maintained, to ensure national defence in
case of a threat to the state.

29. Latvia maintains its personnel reserve and mobilisation systems according to the existing
threat level, and the amount of resources invested in this system is adjusted to the tasks to
be performed by the NAF. These systems are based on the duty of citizens to defend their
country’s independence, freedom and democratic state structure yet do not require
significant funds or the need for maintaining a large mobilisation reserve in a state of
high readiness. The National Guard is responsible for maintaining the NAF’s personnel
reserve system.

30. It is essential to develop a personnel reserve system that would not only allow for
augmentation in case of a threat to the state, but also allow additional resources to be
allocated in peacetime and in support of NAF tasks in NATO collective defence
operations and peace support operations. In developing such a personnel reserve, it must
be taken into consideration that the NAF must be competitive in Latvia's labour market,
and appropriate training, procurement and logistics systems for these reserves must be
developed.

**7. Strengthening international security**

31. Assuming co-responsibility for ensuring security in the Euro-Atlantic area, Latvia
strengthens international security while simultaneously investing in its own security.

32. In light of persistent global threats, timely action and close cooperation between states
and international organisations in reducing potential threats and promoting international
security is becoming increasingly important. Coordinated actions between the UN
(United Nations Organisation), NATO and the EU is in Latvia’s interests, because the
crisis management resources at the disposal of these organisations provide the most
appropriate solutions for international crises. Latvia supports the coherent development
of NATO – EU cooperation, without overlapping of functions and capabilities.

33. Latvia is involved in strengthening international security by participating in international
operations, implementing regional cooperation, and providing support to NATO partner
countries in implementing defence reforms.


-----

**_7.1. Participation in international operations_**

34. Latvia's participation in international operations strengthens international security and is
simultaneously an investment in national security. By participating in international
operations, Latvia promotes cooperation with its NATO and EU allies, provides them
with political and practical support for resolving current security issues, and gains
valuable military experience.

35. Latvia plans its participation in international operations according to national security and
foreign policy priorities. Basing security on the principle of collective defence, Latvia’s
priority is participation in NATO-led operations. Simultaneously, taking into account
available human and financial resources, Latvia is involved in EU-led and other
international operations.

36. Stabilisation efforts and the promotion of security in regions of international crises
require a comprehensive approach using both military and civilian resources. Therefore,
Latvia is involved in strengthening international security not only through military
means, but also with civilian resources.

37. The capabilities at the disposal of the EU are important for the timely prevention of
international crises and stabilising post-conflict situations. It is in Latvia’s interests to
promote the coordinated use of EU and NATO civil and military resources for solving
security problems.

**_7.2. Regional cooperation (cooperation between the Baltic States, cooperation with the_**
**_Nordic countries)_**

**_7.2.1. Cooperation between the Baltic States_**

38. Military cooperation amongst the Baltic States is based on their common interests and
objectives and is aimed at improving the security and welfare of each country, as well as
maximising their contribution to NATO and the EU. Close cooperation between the
Baltic States is a key tool for strengthening Latvia’s stability and security and facilitates
the development of the Baltic States’ armed forces and their interoperability.

39. The Baltic States must continue to develop new and improve existing common military
projects to ensure the effective use of limited resources and improve common military
capabilities. Cooperation must lead to increased effectiveness of the Baltic States’ armed
forces contribution in international operations, and their readiness to provide host nation
support.

**_7.2.2. Cooperation with the Nordic countries_**

40. Cooperation between Latvia and the Nordic countries is based on the common interests
and principles of promoting stability and security in the Baltic Sea region, strengthening
each individual country’s military capabilities, readiness to participate in international
operations, and effectively using human and financial resources to develop military
capabilities. This provides opportunities to formulate common positions on various
security and defence policy issues, increases influence in decision making processes in
international organisations, and improving the defence capabilities of each country.

41. It is important for Latvia to continue cooperation with the Nordic countries in the
following main areas: pre-deployment training and common contributions to operations;
personnel training and personnel exchange; logistic and procurement issues; advice on
host nation support issues, defence planning, and environmental protection.


-----

**_7.3. Support for NATO partner countries in defence reforms_**

42. As a full-fledged NATO member state Latvia is part of a much broader common security
space and has assumed new responsibilities in strengthening international security and
stability. Following NATO policy, Latvia actively cooperates with the countries which
have stated developing closer cooperation with NATO and the EU as foreign and security
policy goals.

43. Latvia’s objective in sharing its accrued experience in democracy building, Euroatlantic
integration, and developing the security and defence sector, is to provide the necessary
support to NATO partner countries to assist them in successfully implementing necessary
defence and security reforms.

44. Based on the interest expressed by partner countries in cooperating more closely on
defence and security issues, Latvia is ready to share its experience in the area of defence
reform with countries of the South Caucuses and Western Balkans, Moldova and
Ukraine. The main areas of cooperation cover personnel training, advising defence
experts from partner countries and supporting the strengthening of military capabilities.

**8. Resources**

45. In order to carry out national defence tasks, meet NATO and EU commitments,
cooperate with allies and participate in international operations and taking into
account changes in the international security environment as well as the changing
and unforeseeable nature of security challenges, state funding for defence is targeted
to 2% of gross domestic product. During the NATO Summit in Riga in November
2006, NATO countries affirmed their commitment to ensuring sufficient funding for
national defence.

46. Within NATO and the EU, Latvia takes part in multinational initiatives and other
activities with an aim to developing military capabilities directed toward the efficient use
of resources and which correspond to national defence development priorities.

**9. Action priorities**

47. The development of the NAF and the strengthening of national defence are carried out
according to the following directions and priorities:

a. Development of the professional military service by strengthening the recruitment and
selection process, improving soldiers' professionalism and raising the prestige of the
professional soldiers job, creating an effective training system, ensuring a competitive
salary, social benefits and the construction of housing;

b. Procurement of necessary armament and equipment as well as ensuring appropriate
training to increase the combat capabilities of NAF units and ensure force protection;

c. Preparation of NAF units for participation in international operations, increasing their
operational experience and logistics capabilities; ensuring the readiness of the NAF for
participation in the full spectrum of NATO operations with one battalion for up to six
months without rotation;

armed forces on the territory of Latvia;

g. Development of the reserve and mobilisation systems in accordance with modern
security requirements and the NAF’s tasks;

h. Continuation and improvement of common military projects between the Baltic States,
thereby ensuring the effective use of limited resources and the improvement of
common military capabilities;

i. Continued cooperation with Baltic Sea region NATO and EU member states to
strengthen military capabilities and readiness to participate in international operations;

j. Providing support to NATO partner countries by sharing experience in security and
defence sector reform according to predefined cooperation priorities;

k. Targeting national defence funding at 2% of gross domestic product and achieving the
maximum effective use of resources;

l. Patriotic education of youth, ensuring the preservation and passing on of historical
memory, immortalizing historical testimony and ensuring its dissemination.

**10. Final Provisions**

48. The strategic principles and the guidelines for ensuring national defence and development
of military capabilities outlined in the State Defence Concept have been set for the
medium and long term.

49. Guided by the State Defence Concept, the National Defence Plan is being elaborated to
specify national defence activities, priorities and necessary resources and identify the
necessary readiness level and responsibilities of institutions, individual or legal entities
involved in ensuring national defence. Development plans for the NAF are elaborated
based on the National Defence Plan.

50. Latvia’s state institutions ensure the implementation of the State Defence Concept
