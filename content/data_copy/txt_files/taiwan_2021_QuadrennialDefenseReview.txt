# Minister'S Foreword

National Defense is the cornerstone to guarantee the security of a nation, and the mission and core value of the ROC Armed Forces is to deter and defeat the enemy's invasion. While the People's Republic of China (PRC) has never renounced the use of commitments and diligence to operational training and seizing decisive opportunities to overtake the enemy, we can overcome the threat and against all odds, be the sturdiest shield to defend the nation and the people, and fulfill the goal to maintain the stability across the Taiwan Strait.

1 The regional situation is becoming more complex and precarious. The PRC is postured as the major threat to our national security. Aside from posing threats of conventional military invasion and continuous war preparation, the PRC has been imposed new security challenges on us, including the using of gray zone tactics, such as the intrusion and provocation by aerial and maritime assets, waging cognitive warfare by verbal intimidation, saber-rattling, and initiating cyberattacks. It is therefore a routine task of the ROC Armed Forces to respond cautiously to those threats to our national security.

Holding a belief that "Saving Our Own Country by Ourselves," and "Being WellPrepared for War is the Way to Preserve the Peace," the ROC Armed Forces is determined to defend the nation. By improving force buildup, readiness and training, we aim at building a defense power with "Resolute Defense and Multi-Domain Deterrence." No matter facing the traditional and non-traditional threats or the coercive actions of the PRC, stick to the commitment and responsibility for the nation and the people.

As stipulated in the Article 31 of the National Defense Act, the MND shall "within ten months after each presidential inauguration, publicly submits the Quadrennial Defense Review to the Legislative Yuan." The 2021 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) is the second edition published during the terms of President Tsai Ing-wen. Over the past 4 years, with governmental support in terms of policies and budgets, the ROC Armed Forces has achieved remarkably in the acquisition of weapons and equipment, acceleration of upgrading operational capabilities, transformation of military service system, and domestically-produced aircraft and naval vessel programs, which could let the general public see our efforts and progress. In the future, we will spare no efforts to strengthen our self-defense, and focusing on prioritized policies on defense transformations, so as to maintain our overall defense competitiveness.

First of all, the transition to a volunteer recruitment system has reached the goal of 90% manning ratio. The MND will focus on improving personnel quality at the next stage. We will strengthen the personnel appraisal system and educational efforts for talents to serve in the military. Secondly, by actively bringing new weapon systems into service and steadily strengthening long-range strike capabilities, we are inspiring the morale of the ROC Armed Forces as well as the effectiveness of joint operations. Hence, the MND 
continue to develop innovative tactics as the weapon performance increases, through reinforcing rapid mobility, precision strike, effective countermeasures, and asymmetric warfare capabilities, and conduct rigorous and realistic combat-oriented training, in an war.

In addition, our efforts to establish a self-reliant defense have reached initial success. In order to maintain the national security on our own, the MND remains steadfast to develop indigenous weapon systems, endeavor to make major technological breakthroughs, and rejuvenate defense industries and economic development. The ROC Armed Forces has been reforming the reserve force, enhancing its capabilities, and improving mobilization system, so as to construct a solid all-out defense power to deter the enemy. 

"To defend our homeland with our lives and all means," the lyrics are from a song 

!"\#$	

&
$	'


- to safeguard our airspace. His song demonstrated the conviction and belief of all service * obligations and missions, the ROC Armed Forces shows no fear to face adversity or death, and it is the reason that we have won the admiration and support from the people.

The ROC Armed Forces will continue to demonstrate its self-defense determination through the force building and secure the country by its reliable strength. In addition, we will improve the personnel quality by leading the troops in a faithful and pragmatic way. By those efforts, we can build a strong and well-disciplined elite force respected by the people, reshaping the ROC Armed Forces with a brand new look.

# Introduction

Overviewing the current strategic situations, mainland China, aspiring to become an international superpower, is eager to undermine the international order and regional stability. It has been particularly imposing coercive means of verbal intimidation and saber-rattling, intrusion and provocation by aerial and maritime assets, cyberattacks, and cognitive warfare—forcing us to succumb to their will. 

Amidst the rapid-change external situations with full of severe challenges, the ROC Armed Forces is absolutely responsible for defending Taiwan. Only by improving ourselves and striving forward, accelerating force buildup and focusing on defense reform a prosperous future for the nation.

The QDR is a guiding document that directs the future development of the ROC 
Armed Forces. "Striving Forward and Creating a New Prospect" is the motive of the 2021 QDR. The 7 chapters are summarized as follows.

*
strategic competition between the U.S. and the PRC has been impacting the regional geopolitics and economic development. The growth of comprehensive national power and military expansion of the PRC are posing an ever-growing threat to the region and our nation, while nontraditional security issues are also upsetting the security of countries involved. Therefore, we have been keeping a close eye on the changes in the strategic environment and dealing with all emerging security challenges carefully. 

## 7/(

The strategic situation in the Indo-Pacific region is mainly influenced by the interaction between the U.S. and the PRC. The U.S. continues to enhance cooperation with allies to fortify regional security, while the PRC keeps expanding its military activities and conducting gray zone operations that cause serious impact on the regional peace and stability. Furthermore, there are destabilizing factors arising from the Korean Peninsula, the ECS, and the SCS.

The PRC is exploiting its "Belt and Road Initiative" (BRI), a comprehensive strategic framework, to enhance its external political and economic leverages. It is promoting "military-civilian integration" to develop key technologies and improve its force projection and long-range precision strike capabilities. In addition, it applies political, economic, and diplomatic clouts and cognitive warfare tactics to shape a strategic environment favorable to its rise, so as to help it attain the reginal dominance.

Even though the U.S. and North Korea held two summits, denuclearization progress of the Korean Peninsula is showing signs of stagnating due to the disagreement between both countries. North Korea has persisted in its nuclear weapon programs, conducted missile test launches and exhibited new intercontinental and submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and unilaterally halted communication with South Korea. These actions have caused regional anxiety for future development in Northeast Asia.

Territorial and sovereignty disputes continue to affect the interactions among reginal countries. Japan unilaterally renamed an administrative area of Diaoyu Islands, whose surrounding waters have been routinely entered by public vessels of the PRC, resulted in tensions between both sides. Besides, the PRC and neighboring countries in the SCS on issues of sovereignty and maritime rights is at odds. Member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) announced a joint declaration after the summit in 2020 to stress that all countries concerned shall maintain self-restraint and refrain from the escalation of clashes. Moreover, the clash and standoff between China and India in the * developing situations have increased uncertainties to regional stability.

The PRC has never renounced the use of force to invade Taiwan. Since its military reform in 2015, the PRC has strengthened its military power, conducted exercise, simulations and drills to rehearse its operations against Taiwan, and initiated gray zone tactics, posing greater security threats to our country. According to its recent military power development, PRC's operational capabilities against Taiwan include:

When conducting live drills and exercises targeted at Taiwan and intrusion and provocation by air and naval assets, the PRC intentionally uses the media and the internet to conduct propaganda of those activities as a form of psychological warfare to intimidate Taiwanese people. Moreover, it has deployed anti-ship ballistic and hypersonic missiles to demonstrate its capabilities of long-range power projection. PRC aircraft carriers and strategic bombers also routinely conducted cross-island chain training missions to sharpen its capabilities of Anti-Access and Area Denial (A2/AD) to deter foreign militaries from intervening in Taiwan Strait issues.

## Strategic Guidance:

In compliance with the Constitution of the Republic of China 
(Taiwan), the National Defense Act, and the President's national security guidance, the Ministry of National Defense (MND) has evaluated the comprehensive strategic environment, to formulate defense and military strategies, which provides the guidance on the defense policy implementation and force buildup, so as to establish a robust defense force to ensure our national security. 

## J!

As the Constitution stipulates, "The national defense of the Republic of China shall have as its objective the safeguarding of national security and the preservation of world peace." The MND has been making efforts to construct a resolute defense and assure peace of the nation with steadfast resolve and robust military strength. Based on the guidance of "no fear of confronting the enemy," the ROC Armed Forces do not compete with the enemy in an arms race, we have been committing ourselves in force buildup and operational preparedness, so as to prevent war, protect our national interests, ensure the national security, and play a major role in defending democracy.!!!

## 6)	!"	,J!

(1) Safeguarding national sovereignty and the value of democracy and freedom The ROC Armed Forces will safeguard the integrity of our national sovereignty and the democratic institutions with a solid defense, to demonstrate our determination of "Absolutely No Concession on Sovereignty; No Backing Away from Democracy and Freedom" 
(2) Shaping a secure environment without threat The priority of defense preparedness is to prevent war, deter the external military aggression, make use of the comprehensive defense power to secure our homeland, and raise the cost and risk of PRC invasion, and ultimately protect people's lives and properties. 

(3) Being the guardian for national survival and development The defense strategy is formulated and implemented to construct a credible defense force, integrate defense technologies with civilian capacities, facilitate the reform on defense affairs, and be ta strongly support to the prosperity and development of the nation.

(1) Fortifying national security In response to severe military challenges directly from the PRC, the ROC Armed Forces shall develop effective defensive capabilities with an asymmetric concept to deter the enemy's military actions, so as to achieve the goal of war prevention and peace maintenance.

## (2) Dealing Defense Affairs With Professionalism

Considering contemporary types of high-tech war and our defense requirements, the effectiveness of our defense organization shall continue to be optimized, and the reform of defense affairs shall be pursued pragmatically, so as to cultivate quality personnel and forge a modern, knowledgeable, and professional elite force.

## (3) Realizing A Self-Reliant Defense

Our nation has been striving for a self-reliant defense, and has gained concrete achievements in recent years. We continue to promote the integration of civ-mil ]


5 and equipment and conduct maintenance activities, so as to facilitate the upgrade of associated civil industries, invigorate developments for defense technologies, and meet our requirements for defense and national security.

## (4) Protecting Well-Being Of The People

Facing non-traditional security threats, the ROC Armed Forces, based on the principle of "HA/DR and anti-epidemic efforts are equivalent to operations," will arrive to engage in disaster relief operations rapidly, so as to protect our homeland and the well-being of the people. In addition, to maintain the sovereignty of our territorial sea, the ROC Armed Forces shall assist in protecting our maritime rights.

## Military Strategy

The military strategy of the ROC Armed Forces is "Resolute Defense and Multi-domain Deterrence" that aim at developing joint capabilities with all-out defense and make use of longrange and multi-domain deterrence measures to create advantages to discourage enemy's aggression and ensure homeland security.

## 6				!

 The ROC Armed Forces continues to enhance ICE capabilities to ensure the security of our C2 nodes, critical assets, and critical information infrastructure, and improve our force protection and preservation, so as to enhance our joint countermeasures and defensive capabilities. The allout defense strength and the natural barrier of the Taiwan Strait shall also be exploited to achieve a multi-layered defense in depth. Our operational sustainability shall be strengthened to achieve a strategic endurance.

## !/)				$<",$!

With the concept of the asymmetric warfare, multi-domain deterrence measures shall be used to perform joint capabilities to deter the enemy's aggression in multiple domains. If the enemy launched attack to invade Taiwan, Our guiding principles were to "resist the enemy on the opposite shore, attack it at sea, destroy it in the littoral area, and annihilate it on the beachhead," and impose multiple interdictions and joint fire strikes to degrade its capabilities, disrupt its offensive and prevent it from landing, so as to ultimately defeat its aggression.

Force buildup and operational preparedness are the essential missions of our national defense. Guided by the military strategy and defense requirements, the ROC Armed Forces mapped out the development of joint capabilities, and continue to force buildup. Through efforts to pursue asymmetric capabilities, reform on reserve force, integrate logistic capacities, and improve C4ISR, IW, and EW capabilities, we will strengthen our military force to become more agile, multifunctional, flexible, and swift in response to contingencies and more credible to can deter and defeat any aggression. 

## (!

Based on the military strategy of "Resolute Defense and Multi-domain Deterrence," 
the ROC Armed Forces has orientated the development of joint capabilities toward building fundamental and asymmetric capabilities. We continue to review the acquisition and priority of weapons and equipment, bring the results into force buildup plans, fortify combat readiness, enhance the quality of realistic training, and upgrade joint capabilities. 

## 6	'!,

Following the military strategy and the force buildup direction towards "technology oriented, IW/EW superiorities, l joint interdiction and homeland defense," the ROC Armed Forces continues to establish fundamental as well as asymmetric capabilities and strengthen reserve force and all-out defense. Concerning weapons and equipment acquisitions, we shall first pursue self-reliant development and production. If the demanding acquisition cannot be fulfilled in time by domestic industry or for the equipment which can rapidly improve combat capabilities, we will resort to coproduction or foreign military sales (FMS) channels. The future force buildup goals are as follows: 
 

## (1) Long-Range Strike

Air-launched missiles with highly extended range and stand-off attack weapon systems are to be developed to inflict precision strike against the enemy, stretch out the depth of strategic defensive operations, and conduct the multi-domain deterrence. 

## (2) Counter-Air Operations

To gainair superiority, new fighters and long-range air defense and anti-missile defense systems are to be developed and acquired. Air defense assets from the services shall be integrated into a kill-chain of seamless air and missile defense, an $

## (3) Sea Control Operations

To ensure our fundamental capabilities to maintain sea control and the security of SLOCs, the battleships must to be upgraded. There are also plans to acquire shore-based, shipborne, and air-launched anti-ship missiles and new naval mines. Furthermore, coastal mobile asymmetric anti-ship capabilities are to be strengthened against the enemy vessels in transit. Along with natural barriers by the Taiwan Strait, we will degrade and defeat the enemy's landing operations.
