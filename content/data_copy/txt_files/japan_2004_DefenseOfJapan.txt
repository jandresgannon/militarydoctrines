**Junichiro Koizumi**
Prime Minister

This year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Defense Agency and the Self-Defense Forces.
Over the past half-century Japan has emerged from postwar chaos to become the world’s second largest
economy. Credit for this goes to Japan’s firm adherence to a purely defensive posture and its implementation
of a suitable defense policy while focusing on the stable livelihood of its people and endeavoring to pursue
peaceful diplomacy, thus enabling Japan to enjoy peace throughout the Cold War without once being drawn
into a conflict.
During this period, Japan consistently maintained the minimum defense capabilities necessary and
appropriate to an independent country and the SDF has, in conjunction with the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements, served as a deterrent to an invasion of Japan.
The Cold War finally drew to a close 40 some years after the end of World War II, but since then new
elements of instability have appeared, as seen in the Gulf War. Cooperation within the international
community in dealing with these issues has grown even more important.
The SDF, since its minesweeping mission in the Persian Gulf, has actively represented Japan in the
forefront of international contributions, participating in peacekeeping operations, providing counterterrorism
support in the Indian Ocean, and supplying humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to Iraq.
At this half-century mark, Japan is giving careful consideration to the defense capabilities it needs to deal
with new threats such as international terrorist organizations and the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction and ballistic missiles.
Needless to say, the peace and safety of the nation cannot be secured simply through the efforts of the
Defense Agency and the SDF, and public understanding and support is essential.
It is my sincere hope that this White Paper will be widely read by the public, that it will prove helpful in
giving them a better understanding and appreciation of Japan’s defense efforts, and that it will encourage them
to grant the Defense Agency and the SDF their strong support.

**Foreword**

**Shigeru Ishiba**
Minister of State for Defense

On December 24, 2003, with the participation of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi in his capacity as
commander-in-chief, a ceremony was held at Komaki Air Base to mark the formation of the first ASDF
transport unit to be dispatched to Iraq under the Humanitarian Relief and Iraqi Reconstruction Special
Measures Law.
I felt somehow apologetic about hosting an event that signified the assignment of young SDF personnel to
a difficult mission on a day that for many people is one of the happiest of the year.
At the send-off party held after this ceremony, I circulated through the venue to exchange words with, and
offer encouragement to, as many SDF personnel as possible. As I was doing so, a young airman shook my
hand and said, “Hearing an address by the Prime Minister in person and receiving such encouragement from
the Minister of State for Defense has made this my best Christmas Eve ever. I promise to carry out my
assignment to the best of my ability.” Nothing had moved me quite as much since becoming the Minister of
State for Defense, and I shall not forget that moment as long as I live.
To know that Japan has young people such as he and that the SDF is an organization made up of such men
and women gave me immense pride in serving as Minister of State for Defense at this particular time.
I enjoyed a similarly moving experience on June 6 this year at the party held to welcome home the first
GSDF troop to return to Japan after completing outstandingly their mission in Samawah, Iraq.
I have no adequate words to describe the efforts these SDF personnel made to win the hearts of the local
people and carry out their duties safely in the still dangerous city of Samawah. They admirably accomplished
the objectives of their dispatch to Iraq: serving the national interests of Japan, carrying out the country’s
responsibilities as a member of the international community, meeting the needs and expectations of the Iraqi
people, and strengthening bilateral trust under the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.
Recent years have seen a dramatic improvement in the high regard with which the SDF is held both in
Japan and abroad. One opinion poll has noted that nearly 70% of the Japanese public now has a positive
opinion of the SDF, twice the level of 20 years ago, and heads of state and defense ministers visiting my office
at the Defense Agency have been quite forthright in their praise of the SDF’s performance. This genuine
acclaim from observers inside and outside Japan has been more than justified by the SDF’s efforts in
translating Japan’s desire for peace and its goodwill into reality in such challenging environments as Iraq, the
Golan Heights, the Indian Ocean, and East Timor, and by the efforts of the men and women of the SDF at
home in carrying out their oath to maintain the nation’s independence and peace and protect the lives and
property of its people.


-----

Nevertheless, we are by no means content to rest on our laurels.
The security environment encompassing Japan has become much more complicated since the end of the
Cold War, especially since 9-11. Drastic reforms are needed across the board—in legal framework, equipment,
organization, and operations—to cope with these challenges, and even short delays in making these reforms
would be inexcusable for a responsible government.
To put it into a catchphrase, our policy must be shifted “from the SDF that exists to the SDF that
functions.” This requires thorough examination of all aspects of the four areas of reform mentioned above.
Work on Defense Posture Review to be completed by the end of the year and it is being pursued day and
night at the Defense Agency, and discussions are also underway at the Council on Security and Defense
Capabilities set up under the Prime Minister’s Office.
The Concept of Basic Defense Force proposed in the 1976 National Defense Program Outline and
essentially carried over in the present Outline has proven truly useful in its time in long protecting the
independence and peace of Japan. Nonetheless, a fundamental debate is needed on whether it will continue to
be effective in future.
In engaging in the debate, it should be borne in mind that a self-protective or defensive attitude on the part
of individuals or organizations is by no means conducive to an effective solution worthy of being termed
“defense reform for the nation.”
Japan must also go beyond domestic debate to positively declare what steps it should take internationally
and how the international community should address new threats, and then act on these pronouncements.
At the conference hosted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) in Singapore this year
and last, I raised several issues regarding the need for using defense capabilities in a manner similar to the
exercise of police authority. Consensus has yet to be reached within the international community on what
actions constitute terrorism and whether measures against terrorism constitute a “war” in the conventional
sense. The U.S. is indisputably the sole superpower today, but there are naturally limits to what the U.S. can
do alone in tackling problems in this confused world. Therefore, Japan should also accept a role to clarify its
stance on how the international community should address such matters.
Enjoying benefits, of course, entails assuming risks. As with the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements,
security for a nation is only viable if the fulfillment of its obligations also serves its national interests, and
considerable effort must be made to preserve security.
If Japan desires, as stated in the preamble of the Constitution, “to occupy an honored place in an
international society,” then it must make clear what systems it believes are needed internationally and what
risks Japan will assume therein. Might without right is no more than brute violence, but right not backed by
might is powerless.
Public opinion of late has tended to view arguments on defense via a simplistic dichotomy—liberal or
conservative, reliance on the U.S. or independent defense—but reality is not so simple. All discussions of
defense issues should be elaborate and rational rather than careless and emotional.
Whether we wish it or not, we are living at a turning point in history. Francis Fukuyama earlier termed the
conclusion of the Cold War “the end of history,” but this also means the start of a new history. The rule of law
has yet to be firmly established within the international community, and it does not appear that this will come
about in the foreseeable future. A new order can only be established by realizing the rule of law worldwide,
and making it standard international practice through cumulative effort will likely remain the best approach.
As apparent in the various legal framework being discussed by the government at present, Japan is seeking to
frame a new legal theory. We must think and act with pride and with the sense of responsibility incumbent on
those living in this era.
I would be extremely gratified if this White Paper helps encourage these elaborate and rational reflections
and actions, and I sincerely hope that readers will not hesitate to offer us their suggestions and comments.

## Chapter I

##### International Military Situation


Recently, world security has seen many changes:
threats are now being posed not only by states but also
non-state actors, and illegal acts such as terrorism are
increasingly affecting security. Under these conditions,
states are required to change or diversify the role of
their military forces, and new international relations are
being formed centering on the United States, the only
superpower in the world.
In the Asia-Pacific region, territorial disputes and
unification issues remain, activities of international
terrorist organizations are on the rise, and concerns
over weapons of mass destruction are emerging.
In this chapter, security issues that the international
community faces and its responses to these issues are
examined, and the military situation in the Asia-Pacific
region is explained.

## Chapter II

##### Japan’s Defense Policy

In order to ensure peace and security, Japan has endeavored to
establish a more stable security environment in the world through
diplomatic efforts, and to build a sound basis for security by
promoting stability in people’s lives. However, since it is difficult to
ensure security by these efforts alone, Japan adopts watertight
defense measures by, for example, developing, maintaining, and
administrating appropriate self-defense capabilities, as well as
firmly maintaining the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements and
improving their reliability.
Chapter II describes Japan’s security measures, the relationship
between the Constitution and the right of self-defense, basic defense
policies, an outline of the national defense program, improvements
in defense capabilities, and the meaning of the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements and the measures implemented in relation to them.

## Chapter III

##### National Defense and Responses to Various Situations


The SDF mainly tackles national defense issues and prepares
to repel any attempted invasion of the country. However, in
incidents that may significantly influence national peace and
safety or in large-scale disasters, the SDF works with relevant
organizations to maintain and improve its readiness for
immediately and appropriately dealing with a variety of
situations. Such situations include discovery of suspicious
boats, armed agent activities, and terrorism by nuclear,
biological, and chemical weapons.
In additions to three laws to respond to situations of Armed
Attack and other situations enacted in 2003, enactment of
seven further laws to respond to situations of Armed Attack
and other situations and the conclusion of three related
conventions following submissions to the Diet in 2004 meant
the establishment of a legal infrastructure to deal with the most
important situations, such as Armed Attacks, for the peace and
safety of the country and its citizens.
In this chapter, typical operations that the SDF may carry
out, frameworks for diverse situations, and efforts for
legislation to respond to situations of Armed Attack and other
situations will be explained.

##### Efforts to Ensure Peace and Security in the International Community


Efforts to ensure peace and security in the international
community are one of the important activities of the Defense
Agency and the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) in terms of Japan’s
contribution to building a more stable security environment in
the world.
The Defense Agency and the SDF have been providing a
variety of support and assistance activities to help promote the
reconstruction of Iraq in line with the Humanitarian Relief and
Iraqi Reconstruction Special Measures Law. The Defense
Agency and the SDF perform a variety of activities, including
responding to international terrorism activities in the wake of
the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States,
participating in U.N. peacekeeping operations, assisting
international disaster relief activities in response to large-scale
natural disasters abroad, participating in confidence-building
security dialogues and defense interchanges with foreign
defense and military officials, and working on efforts toward
armament management and disarmament.
This chapter explains the significance and achievements of
these activities of the Defense Agency and the SDF.

## Chapter V

##### People and the Defense Agency/SDF


It is important to win the understanding and support of the general
public on a regular basis and to establish human and material bases
through the promotion of education, training of personnel, and
securing of equipment for the Defense Agency and the SelfDefense Forces (SDF) in order to defend the country, respond to
various situations, and fulfill other duties effectively.
Such bases have been established through various relationships
with people, local communities, and private companies. As part of
their support for people’s livelihood, the Defense Agency and SDF
contribute toward making people’s lives safe and secure by
disposing of dangerous objects. In return, local governments
cooperate with the Defense Agency and SDF in the form of
recruitment and reemployment support. Moreover, the facilities of
the SDF and U.S. forces stationed in Japan can be conveniently
used only with understanding and cooperation of the Japanese
people.
This chapter will describe various bases that support Japan’s
defense capability and relationships between the Defense
Agency/SDF and the general public.

## Chapter VI

##### The Future of the Defense Agency and the Self-Defense Forces


The Defense Agency is engaged in extensive studies on future defense
posture in working to ensure defense capabilities truly suited to Japan’s
national security in the 21st century.
Japan must become a country able to stand firm in the face of crisis
while allowing its citizens to live in safety and with peace of mind, and
must fulfill its responsibilities in ensuring the prerequisite peace and
safety of the international community.
This chapter discusses the principal matters for consideration in the
Defense Agency’s studies on defense posture as well as the direction of,
and schedule for, the development of future defense capabilities. Also
examined are the approach to joint operations that has become a key
issue in Japan’s defense posture review and the ballistic missile defense
system approved for introduction by the government last year.
