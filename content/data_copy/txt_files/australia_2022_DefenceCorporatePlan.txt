## Foreword

This is the most complex strategic environment we have encountered as a nation in more than 70 years. 

Major power competition and the rapid advancement of military capabilities require Defence to consider current and future force design, capability investments, and military objectives. Within this context, the Australian Government is committed to developing a more capable military force - one that will allow us to continue to help shape the region's future trajectory in ways that support security and prosperity for all Australians, our allies, and partners. 

Our Defence personnel play a critical role in ensuring Australia's security and prosperity. 

As Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence, I personally thank them for their invaluable contribution in times of peace and war. The Australian Government's priority is to ensure Defence's capability and force structure is fit-for-purpose, affordable, and delivers the greatest return on investment. It is why on 3 August 2022 the Prime Minister and I announced the Defence Strategic Review - to help us optimise Defence's ability to meet the nation's security challenges over the next decade and beyond. The *2022–26 Defence Corporate Plan* outlines new key activities, performance measures and targets, clearly articulating how Defence delivers on its Mission and Outcomes. These measures and targets will ensure the Australian Government and Australian people have a clear view of how Defence is meeting the Government's priorities. I commend Secretary Greg Moriarty and the Chief of the Defence Force General Angus Campbell AO DSC on this corporate plan and on their ongoing work to better align Defence strategy, capability, and resources, keeping Australia safe and secure within the changing regional and global strategic environment. I am pleased to launch the *2022–26 Defence Corporate Plan*.

# A Message From The Secretary Of Defence And The Chief Of The Defence Force

In 2020, Defence released the *Defence Strategic Update* and *Force Structure Plan* in response to our rapidly deteriorating strategic environment. Since that time, the negative trends affecting the Indo-Pacific have continued to accelerate, further emphasising the fact that we now live in a world where the magnitude and complexity of the strategic challenges facing our nation are the most significant in recent history.

Across our region, large-scale military modernisation is accelerating, financial risks are compounding, climate risks are multiplying, advanced technologies are rapidly proliferating, and the use of coercive statecraft and grey-zone activities continue to test the thresholds for conventional military conflict. In response, the Australian Government has committed to developing a more capable and lethal Australian Defence Force. This requires a fit-for-purpose, integrated, agile and resilient workforce. One possessing the necessary knowledge, skills and capabilities to operate new platforms, to develop advanced technologies, to drive innovation, and to meet Australia's future defence and national security needs. It also requires a larger workforce, which is why Defence's total permanent workforce will increase to over 101,000 by 2040. A more capable and potent Australian Defence Force will better enable us to shape our region's future trajectory in ways that support security and prosperity for all - Australians, our neighbours, and allies and partners alike. This includes continuing to acquire longer-range strike weapons, advanced sensors, cyber capabilities, and area denial systems tailored to a broader range of threats, including preventing coercive or grey-zone activities from escalating into conventional conflict. Managing the delivery of this capability is a vital task, which requires deeper engagement with industry to accelerate capability development and to strengthen our supply chains.

On 3 August 2022, the Prime Minister, the Hon Anthony Albanese MP, and the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence, the Hon Richard Marles MP, announced the Defence Strategic Review (the Review). The Review will prepare Australia to effectively respond to the changing regional and global strategic environment and ensure that Defence's capability and force structure is fit-for-purpose, affordable and delivers the greatest return on investment. It will ensure that Australia has the necessary capability to defend ourselves in the most complex strategic environment we have encountered as a nation in over 70 years. It will help us to optimise our ability to meet the nation's security challenges over the next decade and beyond. The Review will be delivered to Government in early 2023.

Critical to navigating this complex security environment are our regional and international partnerships. AUKUS is deepening our defence capability and technological cooperation with the United Kingdom and the United States. Through this partnership, Australia will acquire conventionally armed nuclear-powered submarines; the most technologically advanced underwater capability Defence has ever acquired. AUKUS will also develop joint advanced military capabilities to promote security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. This partnership is a step-change for Australia that complements our efforts to strengthen our network of international partnerships, including with our ASEAN partners, our Pacific family, our Five Eyes partners and the Quadrilateral Strategic Dialogue. Our success is also contingent on our ability to align Defence strategy, capability and resources, and to anticipate and adapt as our strategic environment evolves. To increase Defence's agility and responsiveness as an organisation, we are investing in continuous transformation. As part of this continuous transformation effort, we are launching new whole-of-Defence key activities, performance measures and targets in the 2022–26 Defence Corporate Plan. These new performance measures clearly articulate how Defence delivers on its Mission and Outcomes. They represent a transition away from siloed performance aligned to our organisational structure to an approach that presents an integrated view of Defence delivery. They will ensure the Australian Government and Australian people have a clear view of how we are meeting our priorities. In 2022–23, Defence will continue to support and deliver the Australian Government's priority - to keep Australia safe, secure and prosperous. We are pleased to present the 2022–26 Defence Corporate Plan, which covers the period 2022–26 as required under paragraph 35(1) (b) of the *Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013* and in accordance with section 16E of the *Public Governance and Performance Accountability* Rule 2014.

Together we deliver on our Mission/Purpose through our two Outcomes, the Defence strategic objectives outlined in the *2020 Defence Strategic Update*, and the strategic effects outlined in the classified Defence Planning Guidance. 

## Our Mission And Purpose:

The Mission and Purpose of Defence is: To defend Australia and its national interests in order to advance Australia's security and prosperity.

Defence has aligned its Purpose and Mission to ensure that as an organisation we are focused on delivering our Outcomes for the Australian Government and the Australian people. 

## Our Outcomes Outcome 1

Defend Australia and its national interests through the conduct of operations, and provision of support for the Australian community and civilian authorities, in accordance with Government direction. 

## Outcome 2

Protect and advance Australia's strategic interests through the provision of strategic policy, the development, delivery and sustainment of military, intelligence and enabling capabilities, and the promotion of regional and global security and stability as directed by Government.

## Our Strategic Objectives

![10_Image_0.Png](10_Image_0.Png)

![10_Image_1.Png](10_Image_1.Png) Shape Australia'S Strategic Environment

Australia must be an active and assertive advocate for stability, security and sovereignty in our immediate region. Defence works closely with whole-of-government and international partners to shape Australia's strategic environment and maintain the rules-based order. Our partnerships with regional countries have a long history and Defence continues to expand its defence diplomacy, cooperation and capacity building activities, supporting shared interests with our Indo-Pacific partners. 

## Deter Actions Against Australia'S Interests

Deterrence effects are those that limit a foreign adversary's ability to coerce or use force against Australia. Defence is strengthening its posture and increasing its self-reliance to deliver deterrent effects across all domains. Defence will continue to enhance its lethality and readiness, as well as improve the logistical support required for (high-intensity) war fighting. 

## Respond With Credible Military Force, When Required

Defence must be able to respond across the spectrum of conflict, including with credible force when required. The Australian Government expects Defence to be able to engage in high-intensity conflict and, if required, deliver lethal force in defence of Australia and its national interests. This includes supporting regional partners in times of need. Defence also supports civil authorities to respond to and recover from national and regional crises and disasters as required.

# Our Key Activities

In 2022, Defence commenced a major transformation of performance measurement and reporting. Our new approach improves the clarity of Defence performance information and creates a clear line of sight between our mission, outcomes, strategic objectives, the key activities we undertake to deliver on them and the performance measures and targets that help us determine whether we are successful. 

In the *2022–26 Defence Corporate Plan*, we are introducing seven new key activities and ten performance measures. This streamlined approach will improve the transparency and focus of our performance reporting to the Australian Government and the Australian people, replacing a system that included 76 activities, 21 performance criteria and 63 measures of success. Our new key activities are:
Key Activity 1: Conduct operations and deployments to defend and advance Australia's national interests The Australian Government deploys Defence personnel to operations overseas and within Australia to defend and promote Australia and its national interests. National and international security are whole-of-nation commitments. To deliver on Key Activity 1, Defence also works closely with international and whole-of-government partners and state and territory agencies to respond to disasters and emergencies at home and abroad.

## Key Activity 2: Be A Strategy-Led Organisation

Defence is a strategy-led organisation. Australian Government endorsed direction sets the strategic objectives. The *Defence Strategy Framework*, endorsed by the Secretary of Defence and the Chief of the Defence Force, informs how strategy cascades through the organisation. The classified *Defence Planning* Guidance, released annually, is the primary strategic guidance document within Defence. It helps the organisation translate Government direction into action. 

Key Activity 3: Enable intelligence-informed strategic policy and international operations Classified intelligence assessments and products inform Defence strategic policy and international operations. This ensures that Defence's activities are grounded in an intelligence-based understanding of drivers, capabilities and likelihood.

## Key Activity 4: Invest In Defence People

Defence's integrated workforce brings together Australian Defence Force members, Australian Public Servants and contractors. Defence invests in building and maintaining an environment that attracts and retains a highly skilled, agile and resilient workforce with the necessary skills and capabilities to meet Australia's future defence and national security needs. 

## Key Activity 5: Promote Regional And Global Security And Stability

Defence contributes to the promotion of regional and global security and stability. 

Defence does this through steady and consistent international engagement anchored in our resolve to safeguard our national interests and support a rules-based order. Defence diplomacy and cooperation focuses on enhancing Australia's ability to work with partners in response to common security challenges, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. 

## Key Activity 6: Deliver Future Capability

The Australian Government is providing Defence $270 billion over the decade to 2029–30 to deliver capabilities across all domains, including Information, Cyber, Maritime, Air, Space and Land, supported by critical enabling capabilities. This capability will provide the Government with a flexible range of options to deliver on Defence's strategic objectives. 

## Key Activity 7: Advance Australia'S Prosperity

Defence will grow and sustain its military capability and, through this, contribute to the Australian economy. The significant investment the Australian Government is making in Defence has the potential to have positive impacts on Australia's prosperity, supporting new and existing industries. Our new performance measures and targets are detailed in the Our Performance section and will be included in the October 2022 Portfolio Budget Statements.

## Our Environment

Australia and the broader Indo-Pacific are facing the most significant shift in geo-strategic circumstances since World War II. Great power competition has entered a new, more acute phase. Coupled with rapid military modernisation and the use of grey-zone tactics, the potential for, and consequences of, miscalculation are increasing. We are also in the midst of increasing technological advancement. Just as developments in artificial intelligence, automation and quantum computing are altering Australian society, these technologies are also driving new military capabilities. This includes the translation of disruptive technologies into weapons such as hypersonic missiles, autonomous robotics, anti-satellite weapons, cyber operations and unmanned systems. The profound impacts of these technologies are driving militaries to consider current and future force design, capability investments and military objectives - Australia is no exception. The Government has determined Australia will take greater responsibility for its own security. This includes enhancing Defence's sovereign capabilities and the lethality of the Australian Defence Force to increase our ability to deter threats to Australia, and to make stronger contributions to our partnerships in the Indo-Pacific. This includes holding potential adversaries at risk at greater distance with new capabilities and working with partners to prevent coercive or grey-zone activities that undermine regional resilience and sovereignty. Defence is continually refining its approach to capability acquisition to identify, develop and acquire capabilities quickly enough to respond to new technologies and our changing strategic environment. Strengthening our industry partnerships and continuing to build and grow sovereign defence industry is critical as is addressing supply chain vulnerabilities exacerbated by COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine. Defence's Sovereign Industrial Capability Priorities focus on investing in areas that are operationally critical to the Defence Mission. This includes priorities within the Integrated Investment Program over a three to five-year period and those in need of more dedicated monitoring, management and support due to their industrial complexity, government priority or requirements across multiple capability programs. Defence investment in Australian businesses will benefit the economy and increase Australia's supply chain resilience. Defence industry will be vital to delivering the products, skills and expertise that Defence needs to achieve our ambitious capability program. The Defence Industry workforce will need to grow by 10–20 per cent over the next five years to deliver on Defence's current Integrated Investment Program, along with thousands of additional jobs across other projects in cyber, systems solutions and intelligence. 

## Defence National Manufacturing Priority Road Map

Defence and the Department of Industry, Science and Resources are collaborating on the Defence National Manufacturing Priority road map. The road map is promoting innovation, and encouraging businesses to generate scale and productivity to meet international demand and opportunities by adopting Industry 4.0 technologies. The road map will make a concerted effort to develop enduring Australian Industry Capability, particularly relating to the Sovereign Industrial Capability Priorities. 

Defence is working closely with industry and academia to develop the future workforce through the following programs: - Defence Industry Skilling and Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Strategy;
- Skilling Australia's Defence Industry Grant Program; - Defence Industry Internship Program; - School Pathways Program; - Defence Industry Pathway Program; - National Defence Industry Skills Office; and - Office of Defence Industry Support. Defence continues to strengthen engagement with Australia's international partners. We do this through strong relationships with our Pacific neighbours, Southeast Asian partners, and other close partner nations in the Indo-Pacific region. We are enhancing cooperative engagement and interoperability to meet shared challenges. Defence continues to conduct operations and exercises in the region, including with allies and partners, to underpin the international rules-based order and maintain regional security and stability. The Alliance with the United States has never been more important and deep US engagement is critical to stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific. Defence is continuing to deepen Australia's Alliance with the United States through enhanced force posture cooperation, announced at AUSMIN 2021. New partnerships like AUKUS are accelerating Defence's existing efforts to deliver on our strategic objectives. AUKUS builds on the longstanding and ongoing bilateral ties Australia has with the United States and the United Kingdom. Defence is working closely with AUKUS partners to identify the optimal pathway for Australia to acquire a conventionally armed nuclear powered submarine capability. In September 2021, Defence established the Nuclear Powered Submarine Taskforce. This taskforce is a whole-of-government effort. It is staffed with representatives from the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, Australian Radioactive Waste Agency, the Departments of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Foreign Affairs and Trade, Education, Skills and Employment, Industry, Science and Resources, Attorney-General's and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. Defence is focused on developing targeted advanced capabilities critical to meeting the emerging threats of today and tomorrow. AUKUS is guiding accelerated development of advanced defence capabilities where they will have most impact - both for deterrence and our operational effectiveness.

CREDIT: Leading Aircraftman Samuel Miller These capabilities are being augmented with work on information sharing and innovation to significantly enhance pathways for joint capability development by AUKUS partners. Our combined efforts with the United States and United Kingdom through AUKUS will make Australia a more capable security partner that is better able to support a safe and secure Indo-Pacific. Our bilateral engagement is complemented by our many minilateral and multilateral exercises and agreements, such as the Pacific Islands Forum, Five Power Defence Arrangements, Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, the Five Eyes partnership, and ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting. Australia will continue to be an active and vocal advocate for a rules-based international order designed to support economic growth, security, prosperity and our values. This includes support for laws and treaties, such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and international institutions that help constrain the exercise of coercive power and support collective responses to challenges such as terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We are strengthening our whole-of-government, state and territory relationships to enhance responses to regional and domestic disasters and emergencies. The impacts of climate risks - such as catastrophic natural disasters, pandemics and growing water and food scarcity - are further complicating the dynamics in the Indo-Pacific. They alter the context in which regional actors make decisions, and influence the strategies they pursue to achieve their goals. These factors also contribute to state fragility and the risk of strategic miscalculation. Defence has a key role in supporting the Australian Government's climate and disaster resilience agenda and integrating climate risk into the planning and conduct of activities and operations. Defence also collaborates with other government agencies through our linked programs. We work with the Departments of Home Affairs, Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Industry, Science and Resources and many others to deliver programs such as the Enhanced Pacific Engagement Program, and Centre for Counter-Terrorism Coordination. We contribute to countering foreign intelligence services, counter-terrorism, cyber security, maritime security and other domestic security activities.

Defence is undertaking continual reform to ensure that the organisation can achieve its objectives in a dynamic and rapidly changing strategic environment. Defence must be agile, adaptive, effective and integrated to succeed. In 2020, the *Defence Transformation Strategy* outlined a tranche of initiatives to deliver on these goals. This program of work will conclude at the end of 2022 having laid the foundations for a more resilient and adaptive Defence and the implementation of an enduring transformation system. This systemic approach to transformation will ensure Defence continues to change the way it operates, driven by our evolving strategic environment. To ensure our organisation, strategy, force posture, capability investment, workforce and funding remain fit for purpose, the Australian Government announced the Defence Strategic Review on 3 August 2022. The Review due to be delivered in early 2023 will: - Outline the future strategic challenges facing Australia that may require an Australian Defence Force operational response; 
- Identify and prioritise the estate, infrastructure, disposition, logistics and security investments required to provide Australia with the Defence force posture it needs by 2032–33; 
- Consider all elements of the Integrated Investment Program and provide recommendations for the Program's reprioritisation, particularly in light of recently announced large-scale projects, to provide Australia with the force structure required by 2032–33; 
- Outline the investments required to support Defence preparedness and mobilisation needs to 2032–33; and 
- Outline funding needs to 2032–33 to ensure long-term strategic investments are progressed.

The Defence Strategic Review may result in significant changes for Defence and, if required, these will be reflected in the 2023–27 Defence Corporate Plan.

## Defence Science And Technology

Defence science and technology plays a critical role in defending Australia and its national interests. *More Together*, the Defence Science and Technology Strategy 2030, provides guidance to ensure the national science and technology enterprise is strengthened and explicitly leveraged to achieve scale and address the strategic and geopolitical challenges we face. It includes initiatives to focus resources on Defence's highest science and technology priorities and supports the transitioning of good technological ideas into capability. It is delivering enhanced operational capability to Defence through streamlined and secure innovation pathways. To support the Strategy, Defence is playing a stronger role in enabling and coordinating support from the national science and technology enterprise, which includes other publicly funded research agencies, universities, large companies, small to medium enterprises and entrepreneurs. 

## Our People

Our people are Australian Defence Force members, Australian Public Servants and contractors dedicated to delivering on our Mission. 

"Our diverse workforce is united by shared values and behaviours. In 2020, we launched the Defence Values and Behaviours that highlight how we strive to live our values every day." 
We continue to build on *Pathway to Change: Evolving Defence Culture 2017–22* and move toward a unified vision and shared sense of identity and purpose. 

The Australian Government announced the formal establishment of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide on 8 July 2021. Defence is cooperating fully with the Royal Commission and supports its people to engage and share their stories. Defence welcomes the Royal Commission as an opportunity to learn and strengthen our approach to mental health and wellbeing and to transition from the Australian Defence Force. The Royal Commission's interim report was released in August 2022 with a final report due in June 2024. We continue to implement the Afghanistan Inquiry Reform Program with many of the Inquiry Recommendations now closed. Defence must continue to grow its workforce by approximately 18,500 Australian Defence Force and Australian Public Service personnel by 2039–40. This growth supports the introduction of new capabilities, delivering on the capability investment outlined in the *2020 Force Structure Plan*, and ensures Defence can respond to future challenges. The emerging capabilities identified in the *2020 Force Structure Plan* require new occupations, roles and skills and will change the nature of work and operational service. Defence must recruit, reshape and reskill our integrated workforce. This will enable us to transition to new platforms and systems and build capacity in enterprise capabilities such as cyber, information warfare, data, intelligence, artificial intelligence, electronic warfare, logistics, health, space and nuclear technology and engineering.

Nuclear submarines, space and technology, and modern manufacturing will be vital for Defence to operate with partners within the strategic environment over the next two decades. Defence will not be able to deliver on these key areas without our people. Defence has implemented a number of workforce initiatives including the Defence Strategic Workforce Plan 2021–40 to enhance the way we recruit and retain our people. These initiatives will increase workplace flexibility and continue to make Defence an organisation of choice for Australians. Defence also continues to adopt new approaches to education and training to generate and sustain the skills we need in our workforce to adapt to rapidly changing technologies and meet preparedness requirements. In 2022, the Australian Government announced the creation of more than 300 scholarships across the next five years to grow Australia's nuclear science and engineering workforce to support our AUKUS partnership. Figure 2: Defence values and behaviours.

## Defence Ict And Data Modernisation

Data and technology underpin the ability to make rapid and informed decisions and are critical to everything Defence does. Defence has one of the largest and most complex ICT undertakings in Australia. As well as supporting more than 100,000 Defence personnel ICT requirements, we deliver mission-critical systems, services and strategic communications to enable the warfighting capabilities of the Australian Defence Force globally. Defence is investing in modern, resilient, secure information technology capabilities and services through the 2022 Defence Information and Communications Technology Strategy and the *Defence Cybersecurity Strategy* so that Defence is ready to fight and win in the digital age. In August 2021, Defence launched its first *Defence Data Strategy*. The Strategy outlines the pillars, practical initiatives and priority data areas that are driving Defence's uplift in data governance management and analytics. In 2022, we appointed our inaugural Chief Data Integration Officer and established a new Data Division at the centre of the organisation to drive the implementation of the Strategy's 27 initiatives and embed data literacy as a cultural norm across the organisation.

## Portfolio Structure

The Defence portfolio brings together component organisations that are collectively responsible for the defence of Australia and its national interests and the care and support for our people. The Secretary of the Department of Defence and the Chief of the Defence Force jointly lead Defence as an integrated enterprise, with collective responsibility for strategy, capability and continuous transformation. The Secretary holds responsibility for financial management and stewardship of the Department of Defence. The Chief of the Defence Force holds responsibility for command and stewardship of the Australian Defence Force. This arrangement is known as the Diarchy and recognises the combined and unique leadership responsibilities of these two roles. Organisations within the Defence portfolio publish their own planning documents.

## Governance

As a complex, multifaceted organisation, our management committees bring together our most senior leaders to make the critical decisions that ensure Defence delivery on the Mission and Government priorities. Defence management committees play a central role in setting priorities, managing risk, monitoring performance and aligning resources. The independent Defence Audit and Risk Committee provides advice to the Secretary and Chief of the Defence Force our performance, risk management and internal audit. Figure 4: Defence Management Committees as at August 2022.

![24_image_0.png](24_image_0.png)

## Risk Management

Effective risk management is integral to achieving our Mission and promoting a positive risk management culture. Our enterprise-level risks focus on the operations of the organisation and risks to implementation of Government priorities and achievement of Defence's strategic objectives. The Defence Risk Management Policy and Framework set expectations for managing risk in line with the Commonwealth Risk Management Policy. The Framework defines Defence's appetite for risk. Defence's Framework empowers our people to develop policies, processes and reporting mechanisms for specialist areas of risk. Defence continually reviews and enhances its Risk Management Framework.
