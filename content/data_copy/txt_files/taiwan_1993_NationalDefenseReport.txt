The first Defense White Paper of the Republic of China on Taiwan was published in February 1992. Its aim was to make known to the public the status quo as well as the prospect of defense affairs so that they might gain general support. After its publication, the Paper has been widely acclaimed, and needless to say, members of the Ministry of National Defense (MND) feel greatly encouraged.

To keep the effort going, and to promote the notion of
''popular national defense,'' the MND has decided to issue a new edition every other year. The present 1993-94 edition observes the format of its predecessor. It contains an extensive range of material, including discussion of military strategies, review of the present condition of the armed forces, and report on the latter's innovative projects and achievements.

On the occasion of this volume's publication, I would like to make the following observations in connection with our national defense policy.

1. The past two years have not been able to witness a new international order in the post-cold war era. Although the possibility of large-scale wars has decreased, small-scale regional conflicts persist. Judging from recent developments, one can safely say that international affairs in the future 1

will be characterized by the growing influence of economy and trade as well as the rise of regional consciousness. This is especially true to countries in the Asian-Pacific Region.

Therefore, how to maintain the interests and prosperity of the member states in the Region has become their mutual concern and topic for dialogue. Faced with such new situations, the Republic of China on Taiwan, with her geopolitical vantage point and solid national power, has an indispensable role to play in seeking and maintaining stability and prosperity in this Region; and her government is always prepared to render service to the achievement of the said goal. H.E.

Lee Teng-hui, President of the ROC, has clearly expressed his willingness to build an economy-oriented collective security system with neighboring countries in order to promote regional peace.

2. Currently, the ROC government has taken the initiative to develop benign relationship with the regime across the Taiwan Strait, hoping the issue of unification of China can be solved through reasonable, peaceful, and gradual approaches. However, Chinese Communist authorities have deliberately ignored the fact that the ROC government has always had sovereignty and the rule over Taiwan. They do not recognize Taiwan as a political entity, and deny her legal status in the international community. What's more, they have never renounced their attempt to seize Taiwan by force, and keep on beefing up their military might and adjusting operational deployment to increase pressure on Taiwan. We hope the Communist regime could be sensible to the tide of world events and we are ready to receive its goodwill gesture.

But at the same time, we are fully aware that our national security rests on our own hands. As Sun Tzu, the famous military theorist in ancient China, very well said, "What matters in war is not to count upon the enemy's failure to strike, but to be prepared to deal with them if they do strike." Therefore, our effort in building defense power to maintain national security is absolutely necessary.

3. Over the past forty-plus years, the ROC government on Taiwan has weathered a number of crises and ordeals, but keeps on standing tall and growing. The contribution made by our armed forces should be worthy of praise. With their glorious history and fine tradition, the armed forces, in recent years, have adapted themselves to the changing environment in order to maintain combat readiness and complete the phased missions. Based on national policy, the primary mission of the armed forces is to guard the security of Taiwan in a defensive posture. To carry out their mission, the armed forces are undertaking a restructuring program to streamline themselves, emphasizing quality over quantity, and making necessary adjustments in force configuration, so as to build a "lean and qualitative" force which is capable of rapid reaction and massive firepower. Given the complexity of the tasks and the time it takes to show results, the MND will do its utmost to achieve the objectives with planning and determination.

Finally, we would like to reiterate the fact that national defense cannot be effective without the support from the public as a whole. Accordingly, in dealing with defense affairs, ..

the MND gives primary and full consideration to people's rights and interests, and much values public opinion, always trying to reach a consensus through communication. We do hope that the general public will realize that national defense is an integral part of the whole society, and that without national defense there will be no security, no development, and no prosperity. We believe only through the smooth and dynamic interaction between the military and civilian community can we create a bright future for the country.

# Current Military Situation Of The Whole World

## I. The Characteristics Of The International System In The Post-Cold-War Era

Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, it could be said that the international political situation has entered a Post-Cold-War era. The international politics of this era have had the following characteristics:
First, the United States of America is playing the dominant role in the international system:
Recently, Russia has shown no intention or capability to strive for world hegemony in the international political arena because its economy has continuously deteriorated. The United States, though showing no improvement in its economic growth, remains the largest economic entity as well as the strongest military power of the world. Although American influence diminished considerably when the Cold War ended,its powerful economic and military strength enabled it to assume the sole leadership of the international community.

To ensure its national interests, the Americans traditionally make it a principal foreign policy that balance of power be maintained in all regions of the world. U.S. as a dominant role has some restraining effects on potential aggressors.

1993–94  National  Defense  Report 4 With this unchallenged position in the Post-Cold-War era, the U.S. has adopted a tougher position in dealing with other countries on economic and trading issue.

Second, the rise of economic and trading powers to a new status:
The political and military power which dominated the international community in the Cold War era still exists.

However, since economy and trade are rapidly gaining pòwer in the world, economic development has been set by the governments of various countries as the most important objective of their administrative programs to promote its national power, thus trading problems have become the main cause of conflict and friction between nations. To protect domestic as well as regional markets, many nations seek to create or join in regional economic blocks that are now flourishing. The more successful integrated regional economic organization has been the European Community (EC). (Table 1-1) Its effect has stimulated countries of other regions to follow the model.

In the Asian-Pacific area, the Asia-Pacific Economic Council (APEC) has already been established. (Table 1-2) After drawing more and more countries to be its members recently, this organization gained its influence gradually and seemingly developed into a pattern of Summit Meetings in the future.

In addition, The United States of America, Canada and Mexico jointly promoted the establishment of the North American Free Trade Area which has become effective in January 1994.

The continued development of this regional economic organization will boost economic protectionism but it remains to be seen if it will lead to a state of economic confrontation between regions.

Third, increased potential for regional war:
The end of the Cold War does not mean that peace is forthcoming yet. Global nuclear warfare may be avoidable, but not necessarily mean that conventional warfare will totally vanish from the earth. On the contrary, minor conflicts have occurred in recent years in areas all over the world.

Fighting has never ceased in areas such as Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Somalia while in Palestine, Cambodia and Kashmir, sporadic confrontations continually occur. Looking to the future, we see the possible recurrence of large-scale wars in the Middle East, Korean Peninsula and Indochina. Smallscale maritime conflicts might also be seen in the South China Sea. Special attention should be given to the fact that the Mainland China are expanding their military might. Asia has become the most serious arms race area of the world recently.

(Chart1-1) %
Fourth, the United Nation's standing becomes more significant:
In the Cold War years the effectiveness of the United Nations was affected by the mutual boycott by the two superpowers -- the United States and Soviet Union. As the world situation changes, morality and justice are gradually coming into play in this international forum. The effect directly reflects on the ascendance of the UN's standing and influence.

The most impressive example of the strength shown by the UN was Resolution No. 678 passed in 1990 calling for sanctions against Iraq. And through this resolution, the United States and other countries were urged to recover Kuwait by any means necessary. Subsequently the United Nations adopted positive resolutions to intervene in disturbances occurring in other regions of the world. For example, the UN dispatched peace keeping forces into Cambodia, former Yugoslavia and Somalia. In May 1993 the Security Council passed a resolution demanding that North Korea would not be allowed to renounce the "Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty" and would accept inspection by international organizations. In the future, whether the United Nations can carry out its functions with international morality and justice depends upon the support of its member states for carrying out every Resolution and the peace keeping forces provided by the member states.

## U.S. New Global Strategy Ii.

Since there has been no upturn in the economy early after the end of Cold-War period, the U.S. Government considered that it is not necessary to maintain a huge military force.

Thus, on September 1, 1993, the former Defense Secretary, Les Aspin, announced the new defense plan.

The U.S. Government feels there are four crises in the Post-Cold War period:
Proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass 1.

destruction:
In the past, the U.S. faced nuclear threat from the former Soviet Union, while, now, a new nuclear threat may come from terrorist organizations or nations, which not only can develop nuclear weapons but also can wage conventional or non-conventional wars, thus constituting a threat to the U.S.

2.

Regional conflicts:
Americans have realized from the "Desert Storm'' experience that even though some disturbances do not affect U.S. Security directly, they may endanger U.S. allies and their overseas interests. Therefore, the U.S. must still maintain a relatively powerful military to cope with regional conflicts.

Crisis that results from political reform:
Presently, there are many nations in the world conducting political reform. If any nation (particularly the Commonwealth of Independent States) conducts political reform which is not in compliance with the development of democracy, it would force the U.S. to take a dif3.

8 ferent posture and affect its security and defense plan. Crisis that might result from economic recession: U.S. short-term national security depends on its powerful military force. However, U.S. long-term national security would be affected by economic factors. At the present time, the U.S. economy is still not recovering, and its international competitive capability is reduced; as a result, these will affect U.S. long-term national security interests.

Facing these crises, the new U.S. strategy is designed to maintain a force structure strong enough to dominate two major regional conflicts that may break out almost simultaneously; this is what is called ''Win-Win Strategy''
for its new defense plan. In addition, there is still capability left to deal with other contingencies. Based on this new strategy, the U.S. Department of Defense has formulated the following force structure objectives:
Army: 10 active divisions and 5 reinforced reserve divisions.

11 aircraft carrier combat groups, 1 reserve train-
Navy:
ing aircraft carrier, 10 aviation wings, 1 reserve aviation wing, and 346 surface ships.

Marine  Corps:   174,000 men on active duty and 43,000 men in reserve.

Air Force: 13 active wings and 7 reserve wings.

Nuclear and strategic forces: 18 SSBN, 184 strategic bombers, 500 ballistic missiles. To work out the new strategy, the U. S. redeploys its strategy and continues to deploy about 100,000 men in Europe and Asia. At the same time, the U.S.

Government is making every political and economic means

to eliminate those potential factors that might lead to regional conflicts. Concrete measures are: to promote peace negotiations between Israel and the P.L.O., to keep a close watch over Iraq; to dissuade North Korea from developing nuclear weapons; and to warn Mainland China against exporting mass destruction weapons to Iran and other countries. To keep worldwide stability, the U.S. is also intervening in troublesome areas where conflicts are going on, such as conducting a peace-keeping mission in Somalia, and providing air cover to U.N. forces in Bosnia.

## Russia And Other Members Of The Commonwealth Of Iii. Independent States: Nuclear Armament Control And Armed Conflicts

The economic and political conditions of all Republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) remain either poor or unstable. That notwithstanding, what concern the nations of the outside world most are arms control and armed conflicts in some Republics of the Commonwealth.

These two problems not only threaten the security of the members of the Commonwealth but also endanger the peace of other regions, even the world.

In the Soviet Union's old days, nuclear weapons were deployed in positions in Ukraine, Byelorussia, Kazakhstan as well as Russia. However, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Byelorussia and Kazakhstan agreed to transfer over their nuclear weapons to Russia for storage or dismantling, but havn't yet fully made good on their promises. Ukraine has expressed their dissatisfaction with the too small amount

![33_image_0.png](33_image_0.png)

of aids offered by the West and at the same time wanted to keep a portion of the nuclear weapons inside the country for self-defense purposes. They constantly refuse to sign the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks Stage I Treaty (SALT-I) and Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. They also refuse to hand over nuclear weapons to Russia.

Not until on 14 January, 1994 when Presidents of U.S.,
Russia and Ukraine in Palace Kremlin signed an agreement of withdrawing nuclear weapons deployed within Ukraine, did Ukraine commit itself to handing over to Russia at least 200 nuclear warheads in its possession for dismantling. U.S.

and Russia promised to ensure the security of Ukraine and offered Ukraine some compensation. However, some congressmen opposed this agreement and cast a variable over the effectuation of the tri-agreement.

In the event that Ukraine's nuclear weapons can not be resolved, world peace will possibly be endangered in the future. Yet, the event that some Republics of the Commonwealth extensively sold sophisticated conventional weapons has aroused immediate concerns in various sectors of the whole world. To improve its economic difficulties, Russia began dumping arms to the third world. Besides Mainland China which has been the biggest customer of Russia's arms business, other countries who have never been in this trade now begin to follow suit. In June 1993 Malaysia, for the first time, bought a batch of 18 Mig-29 fighters and the Army of Thailand purchased 33 Russian helicopters. Although Russia's share of the armament market of the world is presently on the decline, the United States is still worried that this sort of intensive arms sale would lead to regional arms race or even

![34_image_0.png](34_image_0.png)

to a general war. Hence, the United States has exerted all efforts to call it to a stop.

Armed conflicts in the Republics of the ex-Soviet Union have long been heeded by various countries over the world.

Tajikistans civil war has caused 50,000 dead and 500,000 persons homeless, and even triggered off fighting between the Russian Army and guerrilla forces stationed in Northern Afghanistan. Azerbaijan and Armenian rebels have been at war with each other for the past five years with an attempt of seizing the territory of Nagorns--Karabakh. In Moldova, civil war was going on due to the emergence of the Dniester Republic and the Russian Army interfered and fought by the side of the Dniester Republic. Georgia Republic is also on the brink of civil war, ex-president Zviad Gamsa-Khurdia and supporters have ever seized several cities on the west of the Republic and the incumbent President Eduard Shevardnadze was even once forced to proclaim national martial law.

Although they reached an agreement to cease fire in late November 1993, the shooting confrontation could break out again any time. 

There are armed conflicts of various scale in other republics too. These small scale skirmishes are not necessarily due to racial enmity. Many factors such as different religion, economic recession and struggle for political power would cause different type of conflicts in different regions. It is, however, worthy to note that the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia has already brought about tensions in neighboring countries---such as Iran and Turkey. These two countries are concerned about the interests of Azerbaijanis who are also Muslems, while Iran has to face an additional problem

![35_image_0.png](35_image_0.png)

of the influx of the Azerbaijanis. In addition, there are about 25 million Russians scattered in 14 ex-Soviet Union republics and Russia still maintains military presence in these republics.

Thus, Russia would more or less be involved in the abovementioned armed conflicts. Russia, at the same time, has repeatedly warned that in case the interests of these Russians who lived in the republics are threatened, it will not keep its hands off. In fact, Moscow refused to withdraw garrison troops from the three Baltic states on the ground that these states adopted a discrimination policy towards Russians living in their countries.

In conclusion, it appears that armed conflicts in the ex-
Soviet Republics would not be easily stopped and the possibility of Russian involvement in these conflicts may become greater in the future. The West is deeply concerned that Russia could use this as an excuse to exercise more control over these Republics and eventually to rebuild, in some form, the Soviet Union's empire. (Chart 1-2)

## 14 Iv. Europe: The Bosnian Problem And New Role Of Nato

Dissolution of the former Soviet Union wound up the confrontation posture of the two superpowers in Europe ; the socialist governments in Eastern Europe collapsed one after another; the unification of Germany and integration of Europe have been progressing at quicker pace; and finally European unity will make the prospects for peace even better than before. However, war has not moved very far from Europe and the shooting war in ex-Yugoslavia which has killed 20 thousand people is still going on. (Chart 1-3)
In 1991 Croatia proclaimed its separation from Yugoslavia to become an independent state. The Serbian army soon gained control of almost one-third of the Croatian territory.

Although a cease-fire agreement between Serbian rebels and the Croatian government army was reached in 1992 under the arrangement of the UN, fierce fighting has occurred from time to time.

Croatia's civil war is not as fierce as the war in Bosnia.

This war, involving Bosnian Muslems and Serbian and Croatian descendents has been going on for nearly two years. The fire has not been extinguished yet, although a sizable UN
contingent was sent there in order to mediate the war and the United States declared to use aircraft to bombard the Serbian troops surrounding Sarajevo. Although tripartite negotiations were ever held in Geneva by the three warring parties. Since the Bosnian Muslems were discontented with the program of dividing up Bosnia, they considered that they have controlled 43% population of Bosnian before the war, thus, they should obtain more territory than that of the 31%
suggested by the program. They even demanded to obtain a safe route to a harbor on the Adriatic seaboard. As a result, the negotiation cracked. War in Bosnia will not quiet down in a short period of time.

The civil war in Bosnia reflects the importance of NATO.

Obviously, only NATO has the capability to deter the civil war. To adapt itself to the new European situation in Post Cold-War period, in January 1994, 16 leaders of NATO's member states held a summit meeting in the capital of Brussel, Belgium and reached some important resolutions. The first resolution called "Partnership for Peace" was designed to invite East European countries, including Russia, to join the military maneuver and other limited activities of NATO. Some European member states have intended to allow some East European countries, such as Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, to become formal member states of NATO. In order to avoid infuriating Russia, the United States hence put forth the resolution of "Partnership for Peace" as a compromise.

The second resolution aimed at strengthening the defense organization for "European Union''-- Western Union which will enable it to employ NATO's resources to conduct its mission. The third resolution aimed at building a ''Combined Joint Task Forces'' to conduct contingent military movement, including the participation of non-NATO countries.

New NATO was confronted with the issue of Bosnian civil war immediately, in fact, the joint declarement of the NATO summit meeting has indicated to help recover the peace of Bosnia. If necessary, air power would be applied. Undoubtedly, if NATO could help to resolve the civil war in Bosnia, its standing would ascend rapidly; otherwise, its standing would decend drastically.

## V. Middle East: Peace-Talks Between Israel And Arabic Countries And The Latent Crisis

For the past 40 years the Middle East has been a region of almost constant wars. After the signing of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in late September 1993, it seems that Israel and Jordan, Lebanon and Syria could gradually conclude programs for settling conflicts between them. Indeed, the scenes of peace that have never before appeared in the Middle East are now on the horizon. However, many factors that lead to turmoil and disturbance in the Middle East cannot be completely eradicated in a short period of time.

Israel and the PLO have already reached a peace agreement based on different motives. The Israelis presume that the PLO and Palestinians will recognize Israel's right of survival as an independent state as long as they are allowed to have Gaza, Jericho and the West Bank of the Jordan River.

The leader of PLO, Yasser Arafat, and his supporters think otherwise. They believe that if they gain autonomy over the above-mentioned areas, they will be in a position to exert pressure on Israel for its recognition of the Palestine State with its capital in Jerusalem. Obviously, the motives of Israel and Palestine are so dramatically different that the peace they arrived at is built on a very weak and fragile foundation. (Chart 1-4)
The rapprochement between Israel and Syria also cannot easily be reached. Syria insists that Israel must return the Golan Heights intact while the latter promises to release only a portion of that strategic point to the former. Syria has considerable influential power in Middle East affairs, especially in Lebanon. In the event that the requests from Syria were refused, it would be impossible for Israel and Syria to reach any peace agreement, and the peace between Israel and Arab nations would never improve significantly. Moreover, Iran's attitude keeps other nations worried. Iran was the biggest winner of the Middle East Gulf War in 1991. This war removed Iran from the threat of its strongest adversary--Iraq--and enabled it to focus its efforts in hegemonic expansion. While Iran has procured sophisticated weapons from Russia and Mainland China, in fact its largest resource is not its military forces, but its attraction with the Shiites sect of Islamic religion and some radical groups in the Middle East. There are a number of fanatical pro-Iranian supporters in Iraq, Egypt, Sudan, Lebanon and even Palestine. The Moslem Hizbollah sect, whose members repeatedly launch attacks against Israeli soldiers, receives assistance and aid from Iran. Iran is quite capable and determined to sabotage the rapprochement between Israel and Palestine.

The situation in Iraq also makes other nations very concerned. Saddam Hussien still holds his nation tightly in his grip and has successfully suppressed the rebellions of Shiites in the south and the Kurds in the north even though he lost the Gulf War. Although the powerful military power of Iraq was drastically reduced in that war and the total strength of the nation has been further drained by the UN sanctions on trade for the past three or more years. In spite of all this, the Iraqi army is still considered the most powerful

one in the Middle East. It is estimated that with the personality of Saddam Hussien, the rich oil deposits and the well-established defense industry, the future of Iraq will influence the peace in the Middle East.

## Vi. South Asia: Kashmir Issue

Kashmir is one of the provinces of northwest India (Chart 1-5). Pakistan and India, however, also claims sovereignty over Kashmir and has provided long-term assistance to anti-
India organizations in the region. Of the three wars between India and Pakistan in the past, two were over the sovereign jurisdiction of Kashmir. What most concerns the world in the Post-Cold-War era is that the struggle for sovereignty over Kashmir becomes more fierce as time goes by. Since both India and Pakistan possess nuclear weapons, the fourth India-Pakistan War, if any, could be a nuclear war.

Kashmir, located at the foot of the Himalayas, is at present ruled by India and Pakistan. There are many ethnic groups or clans of extremely complicated interrelationship in this area; some are pro-Indian local influential groups; another is the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) with a strong inclination toward independence; still another is the
''Azad Free Kashmir'' advocating joining Pakistan. The Inter-
Services Intelligence (ISI) of Pakistan has been providing training and aid of various kinds to the Free Kashmir for a long time. With Kashmir as a sphere of influence the National Conference Party represents the pro-Indian power group and now is losing influence. Most leaders of JKLF have been put in prison by Indian Authorities. Only the Free Kashmir

supported by the Moslem Fundamentalists remain as the most active party. This Moslem organization has often kidnapped Indian officials and, in the past one or two years, has extended terrorism beyond Kashmir and into other Indian areas.

Kashmir independence movement has taken a heavy toll of 7,300 local lives since 1990.

In January 1993 Washington included the Pakistan on the list of countries supporting terrorism and requested Pakistan to take corrective action within six months. If Islamabad fails to do so, it will be considered a country in the same category as Iran, Iraq, Syria, North Korea and Cuba which support terrorism. On March 12 the same year, a series of explosions went off in the downtown section of Bombay, India, resulting in the at least 250 dead and more than one thousand wounded. Although Indian Government did not clearly prove these explosions were instigated by Pakistanis, many Indians believe that as long as Pakistan maintains a close relationship with Free Kashmir, it not only assists them in terrorism actions against India but also supports surreptitiously the militant Sikh separationists in Punjab, India. To prevent the Indo–Pakistan issue from escalating, the U.Ŝ. Administration exerted pressure on Pakistan on the one hand, urging Pakistan police to cooperate with Indian police in conducting the investigation over the Bombay's explosion case, and at the same time demanded that Pakistan stop providing assistance to the Free Kashmir. In response, the US Government will suspend its ruling of including Pakistan on the list of countries which support terrorism. Pakistan certainly does not want to be labelled by the US Government as a country supporting terrorism, yet it finds it difficult to sever the umbilical cord relationship with the Free Kashmir and even harder still for Pakistan to give up the claim to sovereignty of Kashmir.

During the Cold War era the United States had been a strong ally with Pakistan which in turn considered itself a faithful follower. This relationship formed an essential link

in the loosely-knit anti-Soviet front. With the conclusion of the Cold War this US-Pakistan relationship began to show some subtle changes. In 1990 U.S. intelligence organizations suspected that Pakistan was developing nuclear weapons. U.S.

estimated that Pakistan has already possessed 6-10 nuclear bombs. Once any war erupts between India and Pakistan, Pakistan is possible to deploy nuclear bombs on F-16 fighters and enacts a nuclear attack to turn adversary situation. Therefore in 1991 U.S. initiated on arms embargo on Pakistan, to include a 1989 purchase order for 71 F–16 fighters. Since U.S. was convinced that only U.S. ceased selling Pakistan F-16 fighters, The Air Force of Pakistan would lack components gradually and would be unable to employ F-16 fighters as nuclear bomb carriers.

However, US intelligence organizations discovered recently that as early as in 1990 and 1991 that Pakistan has successfully purchased some M-11 missiles from Mainland China, which would pose threat to India. Pakistan always supported the anti-Indian movement in the past. Since it now possesses M-11 missiles, the possibility for Pakistan to make concessions on the Kashmir issue is even less than before. Although war will not likely break out between Indía and Pakistan in the near future, military build-up could ¡:ossibly be accelerated in the South Asia sub-continent. Should the Kashmir problem become a controversy between both countries again in the future, a war may break out and the employment of nuclear weapons will be possible.

## Vii. New Roles Played By The United Nations In Maintaining International Security

One of the essential international security items to be accomplished by the United Nations is the establishment of a peace keeping force. In 1948 the UN established a ceasefire monitoring organization responsible for overseeing the implementation of a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Arab nations. Then in 1949 UN military observers Team was set up in India and Pakistan; UN Peace Keeping Force in Cyprus was established in 1964; a UN Disengagement Observers Force responsible for disengagement of Israeli and Syrian troops on the Golan Heights in 1974; UN Provisional Troops in Lebanan in 1978 and UN Observation Groups in Iraq and Kuwait in 1991. In the same year a UN Inspection Group in Angola and a UN Inspection Group in El Salvador and a UN Inspection Group over the plebiscite in Western Sahara were also established. The following year, a UN Cambodia Transition Administration and UN defense force were set up, with the latter established for the purpose of UN force presence in Serbian sector within the territory of Croatia.

· Judging by the high frequency of the establishment of UN peace it appears keeping forces that the functions of peace maintenance have clearly increased in the Post-Cold-War era.

This is directly related to the termination of East-West confrontation. One can see through other events that the United Nations is now playing a more important part in international security affairs. To cite a few examples: Israeli Prime Minister Yitghat Rabin agreed in August 1992 that the UN
could expand its role in the Middle East Peace talks; in

August of the same year the UN authorized to commit military forces in Bosnia; in September the UN passed a resolution to unseat Yugoslavia in order to force Serbia to cooperate with the West in the Balkan Peace Meeting; in October the UN Security Council passed a resolution to set up a No Fly Zone over Bosnia; and finally, in 1993 Japan, with the urging of the UN, was willing to shoulder a larger share of the security maintenance responsibilities overseas. All these indicate that the new role for UN to keep international security has been justified.

Nevertheless, there still exist some problems in the enforcement of international security by the UN. Firstly, the United Nations hoped that the United States would hand over the command authority of US peace keeping forces so as to extend the military role of the UN. But the US worried that US soldiers under the command of non-US officers would likely become special targets that would endanger their lives.

Some small countries fear that expansion of UN military power would make this organization a tool with which major powers could maintain the status quo of the world. Therefore, the UN will face obstacles if it tries to expand its military status for the maintenance of international security. Secondly, the UN's peace keeping operations are restrained by its own financial crisis. In the execution of the peace keeping mission in Cambodia, the UN has already spent more than 1.5 billion US dollars. It has to spend 350 million US dollars per month, and its 188 member nations almost all owe their membership fee to this organization. It can be said that the UN is now in dire financial straits. Thirdly, several Arab nations accused the UN of becoming an organization of Christian nations and declared that Islamic countries should withdraw from it. Fourthly, although the functions of the United Nations have been enhanced due to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Mainland China holds one seat in the Security Council and remains a variable to the functions of UN. This regime often chooses to abstain from voting on key issues and does not frequently use its veto power as did the ex-Soviet Union.

However, it often takes a different position from other permanent members of the Council. This is a solid fact. Take one case of the Security Council debate as an example. In April 1993 member states of the Council disagreed on whether to mete out sanctions against North Korea in order to force it to join the Nuclear Non -Proliferation Treaty simply because Mainland China would veto it.

## Viii. Conclusion

The international system in the Post-Cold-War era is full of contradictions among its elements. The United States plays a dominant role on the international stage. Any potential threat to world peace therefore should be under much pressure and constraint. On the other hand, trade partners of the United States face the increasingly tougher attitude of the United States. Many nations the world over are pushing for the formation of the block-form of economic region.

Economic and trade competition between nations could evolve into regional disputes. The possibility of nuclear general war has been reduced drastically, yet conventional wars in various regions or areas are still highly possible and there is no evidence of declining. However, there are some clearly encouraging signs, that people have been paying much attention to the importance of democracy and morality, and the UN actions maintaining stability in the world are increasingly recognized and accepted by the people.

In order to adapt itself to the end of the cold war and in coping with its internal economic recession, the United States has adopted a new global strategy called "Win-Win Strategy.'' They hope to be capable of dealing with two regional wars at the same time. In view of the drastic cuts in military forces it is doubtful that the United States is strong enough to fight strong enemies like North Korea and Mainland China if it had to engage in a war like the Gulf War.

The Ukraine has inadequate technology or facilities to handle nuclear weapons yet they have in their possession 1,800 nuclear warheads. It concerns everyone that an accident might happen at any time. Russia is dumping arms on the Third World, which could lead to arms races and even to wars. The armed conflicts within or among members of the Commonwealth of Independent States have already brought about tension for Turkey and Iran. Countries of the outside world suspect that Russia might take advantage of this opportunity to extend its leverage to other republics of the ex-Soviet Union.

The internal war in Bosnia is still going on. From this war one can see that West European countries lack the capabilities and willingness to settle the crisis in Eastern Europe. In this connection, NATO will play a more important role for the maintenance of stability in Europe. The United States will continue to maintain 100,000 US troops in Europe but it hopes its European Allies play a more active role in the confrontation against enemies who threaten the interests

of the West in Europe as well as in other regions. Since West European countries have suffered economic recession themselves, the aspirations of the Americans might not come true. If so, the United States will likely cut its support for NATO and thus NATO's status will decline to a lower level.

Israel and the PLO signed a peace agreement on September 13, 1993. However, factors leading to potential disturbances still exist. Israel hoped that PLO would find satisfaction in autonomy but the latter think otherwise and want to eventually establish a Palestinan State with Jerusalem as its capital.

Hence, a show down is inevitable. Syria possesses tremendous leverage in the future development of the Middle East.

It hopes to retrieve the Golan Heights but Israel wishes to return only a part of it. Besides, the radical organizations of Iran and Palestine maintain a very close relationship, thus Iran has the capability or the attempt to sobatage the rapprochement between Israel and the Palestine. Sadam Hussien of Iraq maintains a tight rule over his country, therefore Iraq might still be able to pose threat to the peace in the Middle East some day.

The sovereignty issues of Kashmir have twice led to wars between India and Pakistan. Since Pakistan has already obtained M-11 missiles from Mainland China, and these missiles can be used as vehicles to carry nuclear weapons, arms races could be more drastic than ever in Southern Asia. Should war between India and Pakistan break out again over the Kashmir issue, the possibility of employing nuclear weapons would increase.

The United Nations has exerted efforts to help restore peace and stability in various regions of the world. However,

the UN will still encounter some problems in its maintenance of international peace. First, the United States is unwilling to release command authority of its peace keeping forces lest it would endanger its soldiers safety. Secondly, some small countries worry that the expansion of military power of the UN would make it a tool for the major powers to maintain the status quo of the world. Thirdly, the UN has serious financial problems. Fourthly, Mainland China frequently take different views on world problems from other permanent memebers of the Security Council. UN actions in maintaining world peace will be less effective until the previous mentioned problems are solved.

# The Military Posture At The Rim Of The Republic Of China On Taiwan

## I. Japan

:
The end of the Cold War has had a complicated influence on Japan. Economically, Japan is trading partners with Europe and America, and other areas grow impatient for the trade surplus enjoyed by Japan. Militarily, Japan continues to rely on the U.S. without change. Diplomatically, Japan, with its immense economic power, has greater opportunities to elevate its international position.

Collapse of the Soviet Union has greatly reduced the pressure on Japan; however, Japan is still short of security because Russia still possesses powerful military strength and at the same time is politically unstable. Large-scale military expansion undertaken by Mainland China and North Korea has made the Japanese particularly perturbed. Mainland China continues to expand its nuclear program and is buying Sukhoi-27 fighters which are capable of threatening Japan proper and its long sea-lanes. The main factor makes Japan disturbed is that Mainland China is also trying to purchase or manufacture aircraft carriers. The pressure orienting from North Korea is also immense. North Korea is believed to

## 31 32   1993–94 National Defense Report

have made great progress in its nuclear development program.

It has test-fired its medium range missile "Rodong I'' which puts Western Japan within striking distance. North Korea is currently developing its ''Rodong II'' missile with a more coverage and its range up to 1, 500-2,000 kilometers.

Japan still depends on U.S. military protection in the Post-Cold-War period. In November, 1993, the U.S. and Japan held a cabinet-level security conference attended by the U.S. Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense and the Japanese Foreign Minister and Defense Minister. The United States is helping Japan develop its anti-missile defense system in order to cope with the threat posed by North Korea's surface-to-surface missile.

On the other hand, the end of the Cold War has certainly given Japan more opportunities to act as a major political power. In June, 1992, the Japanese Diet approved the "Peace-
Keeping Operation, PKO'' which enables its Self-Defense Force to participate in peace-keeping missions sponsored by the United Nations. (Table 1-3) Tokyo has been actively pushing its plan to become a permanent member of the Security Council. These signify Japanese willingness to expand their international participation. However, if the Japanese want to realize their desire, they must improve their image in the international arena. In addition to positively taking part in political activities designed to promote peace and security of the world, they also have to reduce frictions with their trading partners. Most importantly, they must, with a generous and honest attitude, accept responsibility for their crimes committed in the Second World War. In his first press conference held on August 10, 1993, after his inauguration as premier, Mr. Morihiro Hosokawa pointed out that it was a war of aggression and that it was a mistake. Mr. Hosokawa's honesty and straight-forwardness won wide admiration among Asian countries. If Japan uses part of its big trade surplus to compensate for the loss and damage done to the people of other nations by its aggression in World War II, it would win even more applause.

Table  1-3  Japan's  Self-Defense  Force  Strength

## Ii. Korean  Peninsula

Tension over the Korean Peninsula has eased since the Soviet Union collapsed. The most significant change has been that North Korea no longer attached as much importance to ideological issues as it did before it made contact with South Korea. Also it needs to adopt an open door policy toward other nations to alleviate its own economic problems. If North Korea had more contact with the West, its militant character might change accordingly.

In addition, factors that help maintain peace on the Korean Peninsula include meetings between the prime ministers of both sides, the conclusion of a mutual non-aggression agreement by both countries and so on. Since they both have gained admission to the United Nations, their relationship may be improved through this world organization. All resolutions and decision made by the United Nations will serve as the norm for the conduct of its member nations including North and South Korea. Therefore both countries should be obliged to settle their dispute through the world forum rather than by force.

There are some variables which hamper developing a closer relationship between South and North Korea. First, North Korea has a feeling of insecurity and unbalance. Since South Korea has already established diplomatic ties with Russia and Mainland China respectively while North Korea has not yet received recognition from the United States and Japan, the so-called cross recognition concept thus becomes recognition extended to the one side only. This surely makes North Korea feel insecure and off-balance and has a negative effect on

North Korea's willingness to make peace with South Korea.

From the view point of U.S. and South Korea, the most critical issue on the Korean Peninsula is the issue of nuclear weapons and mid-range missiles being produced or developed by North Korea. But in the eyes of the regime in North Korea, the continued presence of U.S. Forces in South Korea and recurring U.S .- South Korean joint military maneuvers have the most adverse effect on this Peninsula.

To encourage North Korea to accept control over its nuclear project, South Korea has shown its intention to suspend joint maneuvers with the U.S. Forces. Also mentioned in its "White Paper on Foreign Affairs" is that the U.S.

Air Force will withdraw entirely from the Korean Peninsula within ten years. North Korea in turn has expressed its willingness for dialogue with the United States for the realization of peace on the Peninsula. The effectness of a reapproachment built between South and North will depend on their sincerity and good faith to keep promises made during their talks and also on the position adopted by the U.S., Japan and Mainland China.

Regarding the military strength of both sides, the North at present has a total of 1,130,000 men while the South has less than 633,000 men.(Table 1-4) Although South Korea possesses modern weapon systems and shares joint defense with U.S. Forces, North Korea still has adequate strength to threaten its opponent. There are also indications to show that North Korea is now fully prepared to develop its own nuclear weapons. This is a dangerous signal that South Korea should not ignore. In this regard, South Korea has never accounted for the withdrawal of all U.S. Forces from the

Peninsula. The situation on the Korean Peninsula indicates that on the surface a peaceful condition is maintained between South and North but underneath they are jockeying for control of the Peninsula.

## Iii. Southeast  Asia

Southeast Asia refers to a region situated to the southeast of the Asian Continent. It consists of the Straits of Malacca, the South China Sea, Indonesia, the Philippines and their littoral areas. It constitutes a strategic position connecting the Indian and Pacific Oceans and consists of ten nations with distinctive differences in their geography, race, religions, politics and economic development (Table 1–5). Hence, from a geopolitical point of view it is hardly a regional entity.

However, due to long suffering under the colonial rule of the Western countries, the regional consciousness has gradually taken shape. Several regional organizations were formed in the early 1960s; among them the most prominent and the most enduring is the Association of Southeast A'sian Nations (ASEAN) which was established in 1967. The primary goal of ASEAN is to promote regional economic cooperation; notable achievements have been the reduction of tariffs and preferential duties. Based on these accomplishments and the trend towards global economic reorganization, the ASEAN
members are planning to build the "Southeast Asia Free Trade Zone'' in the year 2007. Yet the prime minister of Malaysia, Mohamad advocates to hold the "East Asian Economic Nucleus Conference'' to enhance close economic cooperation and to form a union of Southeast Asia and East Asia.

However, the plan is obstructed by the United States and Japan, and is difficult to put into practice within a short period of time.

Under the powerful intervention of the United Nations, the situation in Cambodia causing major disturbance among

38 Southeast Asian nations has become less tense. According to the Paris Pact singed in October, 1991, the United Nations has stationed thousands of peace-keeping forces in Cambodia. Under UN observation, Cambodia's election has been completed and its monarchical constitution has also been established. As Cambodia heads toward peace, the actions of Khmer Rouge are especially drawing most attention. If the New Government cannot satisfy the demands of the Khmer Rouge, they could start large scale rebellions.

Burma, situated in the corner of Southeast Asia, has been under economic sanction from western nations because of its suppression of human rights. However some of the ASEAN
members are not in favor of isolating Burma; on the contrary, they speak for the promotion of better relations with it. Yet Mainland China is taking advantage of Burma's isolation and seeks military cooperation with Rangoon to help establish navy bases for Burma. Some observers perceive that PRC intends to create a passage from the southwest of Mainland China to the shores of the Indian Ocean so as to accelerate the economic development of the southwest provinces.

Along with the prosperous economic growth among Southeast Asian nations, their sense of security becomes weaker rather stronger. Owing to the rapid military withdrawal of the United States and Russia from that area, Mainland China embark again on a forcible position to hold the waters of the South China Sea. Hence, Southeast Asian nations continue one after another to purchase military equipment and to expand their military power. In reality, the South China Sea could become another potential conflict point following

in the wake of Cambodia.

To promote security and stability in Southeast Asia in the Post Cold War period, at the Summit meeting held in Singapore in January 1992, the ASEAN members agreed that security issues will be discussed in the near future. In July of the same year, at the annual meeting of foreign ministers of the ASEAN members held in Manila the regional security issue was first mentioned. A "Declaration of the ASEAN to the South China Sea'' was also proclaimed. In addition, an official and multi-national "Asia Regional Forum" was scheduled to meet in Bangkok in May 1994. The Bangkok convention will play a key role in determining the success or failure of establishing an organization similar to "the European Security Conference".

Besides the protection provided by great powers or alliances among themselves, most Southeast Asian nations lack the capability to protect themselves. The future situation of the Southeast Asian region will depend on the attitude of the United States, Japan and PRC.

## Iv. South China Sea

In recent years, the dispute for claiming sovereignty of the South China Sea has drawn international attention. The area is not only abundant in natural resources but also is one of the busiest waterways of the world; however, it is also a potential powder keg.

In terms of history, geography, international treaties and actual circumstances, ROC has the following solid evidence in support of its territorial claim toward the four archipelagoes in the South China Sea: in 1935, the ''Land and Marine Board'' of ROC published the first official map for the islands in the South China Sea; in 1946, several islands in this area were taken over from the Japanese Army by the ROC Armed Forces; in 1947, the ROC Ministry of Interior promulgated the locations for islands in the South China Sea and the U-
shaped national boundaries.

Since the Spratly Islands are rich in natural resources but far away from Taiwan, nations surrounding the South China Sea, such as the Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam began in the mid 1950s to make inroads to islands near their border (Chart 1-6). In addition to annexing the islands, these nations also aggressively explore and exploit oil reserves in the area.

To control the waters of the South China Sea, PRC engaged in two sea battles, with South Vietnam in 1975 and Communist Vietnam in 1988. In February 1992, PRC passed a law governing territorial water and the adjacent areas, claiming Beijing has sovereignty over Tungsha, the Paracel Islands, Chungsha and Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. In May of the same year, Beijing signed an agreement with an American energy company to co-develop the oil reserves in South China Sea.

Currently, nations other than ROC involved in the contest over the South China Sea are engaged in oil exploration. Every claimant is building up its' arsenal to ensure their potential oil profits. Malaysia purchased advanced fighters from Russia and the US.,and set up a naval station on the island of Sabah. Manila announced its intention to enlarge the airstrip on Thi Tu Island and procured warships. In addition, the

Philippine Government called for the revision of US-
Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty in an attempt to include the disputed islands in the treaty. (Chart 1-6) PRC also built an airstrip on Woody Island in the Paracel Islands and in addition, bought Su-27 fighters from Russia and prepared to build aircraft carrier on her own.

In order to ease tension in this region, Indonesia, along with other ASEAN members, has held four informal talks since 1990. Manila also sponsored a meeting on technology for the South China Sea. Though various proposals aimed at co-development in the contested area were offered during these meetings, the prospect of such cooperation seems remote. The main reason is that the dispute over the Spratlys involves the multilateral scramble for sovereignty over various island reefs. According to the provisions in the Sea Convention imposed in 1982, every island reef has the privilege of a 200-mile exclusive economic zone and the right of a 350-mile continental shelf. Therefore, each claimant will not give up the occupied island reefs belonging to ROC.

In the face of group pressure form ASEAN members to solve the Spratly issue , the strategies adopted by PRC are twofold: one is to reject the internationalization of the Spratly issue and oppose the idea solving the Spratly issue through international negotiation. Nevertheless, PRC is not against bilateral talks. Since last September, four talks have been held between Beijing and Hanoi. The other strategy is to reiterate the position that the issue can be put aside and the contested area be co-developed to end the tense relations with all nations of this region.

In reponse to the fact that the area is encroached by

nations surrounding the South China Sea, the ROC government has reiterated the position that ROC has undisputable sovereignty over the Spratly Islands. Oral statements, however, can not deter ambitions. The activities for exploring oil reserves in the Spratly Islands area is unabated during recent years. Our fishermen are barred from operation in the Spratly Islands area. Accordingly, in an attempt to coordinate and develop policies for the South China Sea through inter-agency efforts, a "South China Sea Commission" was set up by the Executive Yuan. The Commission is composed of deputy ministers from various agencies with the Minister of Interior acting as head of the commission. Its purpose aims at actively negotiating and initiating policies for the South China Sea.

In addition to the peaceful solution of the Spratly issue through negotiation, we should strengthen in the future the defense in Itu Aba Island and Tungsha, with air and sea supporting capability to maintain the territorial integrity of the South China Sea.

## V. Conclusion

The Republic of China on Taiwan, lying between Northeast and Southeast Asia, on one hand, enjoys the most rapid economic development while, on the other hand, is faced with the real possibility of war breaking out.

Japan, although the most wealthy country in this region, is situated in a most insecure position. It adjoins three militarily powerful but politically unstable countries---Russia, PRC
and North Korea. Because the United States is likely to continue its withdrawal of forces from Asia in the future, it is possibile that Japan will expand its military capability to protect itself. If so, it will arouse anxiety among Asian countries.

The situation on the Korean Peninsula is not optmistic either. Relations between North and South Korea have improved immensely, they both even became members of the United Nations simultaneously. However, when South Korea established diplomatic relations with Russia but Japan and America did not recognize North Korea, North Korea was unwilling to reconcile with South Korea and its sense of security faded. Additionally, the fact that North Korea threatened to withdraw from "the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty" while testing its "Radong I'' missile with a range up to 1,000 kilometers has created a tense atmosphere over the Korean Peninsula and Japan. North Korea has about 1,130,000 troops and 3,500 tanks, and most of them are deployed in the areas along the 38° Parallel. Although it is not content with North Korea's nuclear development, Washington dare not impose any sanction on North Korea. The reason is quite obvious.

North Korea is still quite unknown to the outside world; therefore, what action it will take and to what degree it has maintained its internal stability cannot be easily observed or predicted by the outside world.

Southeast Asia lies on the rim of the Asian Continent both geographically and politically. However, a regional consciousness has gradually taken shape among the nations in this area. So the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) was set up in 1967, and in addition, Southeast Free Trade Region will be established in 2007. Due to the boost of ASEAN, in May 1944 Asia-Pacific countries will hold
''Asia Regional Forum'' in Bankok. Whether Asia can establish an organization like "European Security Conference'', the Forum will play a decisive role. The civil war in Cambodia caused anxiety among the countries in the Southeast Asian region. Because of the peace-keeping forces dispatched by the United Nations, Cambodia has completed the general election and the initiation of its constitution; however, the Khmer Rouge are still very likely to cause rebellions in Cambodia.

Over the issue of the South China Sea, PRC, due to the concern from ASEAN, European countries and U.S., has obviously adopted more reconcilable attitude and tried hard to improve its diplomatic relations with these countries in Southeast Asia. However, PRC and ROC still claim its supreme sovereignty over the islands scattered in the South China Sea while ROC, Philippine, Malaysia, Brunei and Vietnam also occupy some respective islands. Thus, the conflict over the South China Sea could erupt again at any time.

However, Mainland China remains the primary source of uncertainty in this area. The Beijing Regime has taken advantage of the dissolution of the former Soviet Union and the withdrawal of American armed forces from Southeast Asia to aggressively expand its armament. After the death of Deng Xiaoping, will the ruling system of the Chinese Communist Regime alter? How much influence does the Chinese Communist military have? These issues are of great concern to the whole world.

Undoubtedly, East Asia and Southeast Asia are currently in a state of uncertainty. In order to protect oneself, every country in Asia is expanding its armament on a large scale,

which makes this region an arena of the most vicious arms race in the world. Situated in such an uncertain environment, ROC must, on the one hand, exert its efforts to develop diplomatic relations with other countries, and on the other hand, establish an effective defense force to cope with any threat against ROC and to ensure its sovereignty and territorial integrity.

# Prc'S Military Situation

## L. The Prc'S Strategic Environment Prc And The United States Of America

Currently, bilateral diplomatic relations between America and PRC apparently are not as close as they were during the Cold War period. Superficially, the repressive event of 4 June 1989 in Tiananmen Square caused a worsening of bilateral relations; in fact, there were other factors causing their bilateral relations to fall to a new low.

With the breakup of the Soviet Union, the strategic status of Mainland China as an anti-Soviet ally with Washington was not as important as before; on the contrary, America was deeply disturbed about the PRC's arms expansion and its truculent behavior over the controversial issues in the South China Sea. Moreover, trade issues between America and PRC
also affected relations between U.S. and PRC. Their bilateral trade reached 33 billion US dollars in 1992, and PRC had a favorable trade balance amounting to 18.2 billion US dollars which , in America's view point, was made possible through dumping and other unjust methods, especially on the issue of textile exports. The PRC's policy on arms sales was also

one of the factors causing tense relations between them. U.S.

has continually accused PRC breaking its promise to sell the technology and components of its M-missile to Pakistan and the Middle East and of its continued nuclear tests. In August 1993 America once again blamed PRC for trying to sell raw materials for manufacturing chemical weapons to Iran. However, the most significant factor deteriorating their relations has always been Mainland China's human rights record.

Many US Congressmen demanded the US President stop offering Mainland China Most Favored Nation Status due to the PRC's repression of human rights, and PRC, in turn, repeatedly charged U.S. with interfering in its domestic affairs.

Those above factors, causing deterioration of the relations between PRC and America apparently will not vanish in a short period of time. However, their relations will not become much worse; after all, they still have to be mutually dependent on each other in many respects. From the PRC's point view, America is not only the largest market for commodities made in Mainland China, but also one of the sources offering Mainland China the essential technology and funds for economic development. Since the United States plays a dominant role in the contemporary international system and at the same time possesses several means to restrain PRC,
the Beijing Regime would not dare to offend America too much. From the US point view, since America desires to maintain world peace through the United Nations during the post- Cold War period, it is necessary for America to seek the PRC's cooperation. If PRC cast a veto vote against any proposal requiring PRC sanction against aggression, this proposal would not be passed by the Security Council. What

is more important, PRC possesses considerable influence over its neighboring countries, especially over the Korean Peninsula, Indo-China, and the South China Sea. It is believed that PRC is capable of causing disturbances in these areas.

## Prc And Russia

Relations between PRC and the Soviet Union have improved since Gorbachev came to power. The Soviet Union started to withdraw part of its armed forces from Mongolia and the bordering areas. At present, there are only about 200,000 Russian forces stationed in the Far East area. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, because the threat from the North diminished greatly, Beijing was more willing to improve relations with Moscow.

As their bilateral relations changed, bilateral trade improved rapidly, reaching 4 billion US dollars in 1992. What is notable is the fact that PRC has been importing a large number of Russian-made weapon systems. A joint communique emphasizing that both sides would renew military interchange was issued when Russian President Yeltsin visited Mainland China in December 1992. The PRC's Chief of General Staff, Cheng Wan-nan, visited Moscow in July 1993, and the Defense Ministry of Russia also visited Beijing in the same year. The mutual visit paved the way for military interchange between PRC and-Russia. Because PRC has been attempting to expand its arms sales and Russia is craving for funds to save its economy and maintain its defense industry, it is predictable that arms trade of mutual benefits between them will increase.

With the increase in bilateral trade and arms sales, their bilateral relations will grow, and PRC will further provide Russia loans or offer certain economic support. However, though the historical hostility between Mainland China and Russia is fading, it has not yet vanished. As a long-term assessment, if PRC continues to pursue a policy of aggrandizement or Russian aggrandizement is renewed, it is possible that they will become hostile to each other again.

## Prc And Japan

Superficially, relations between PRC and Japan remain friendly and stable. There are not any apparent disagreements over their foreign affairs. Economically, PRC provides a major market for Japanese merchandise, and obtains funds and technology in return for economic development.

However, behind the superficial facade, there still exist conflicting factors between them. From the PRC's point view, Japan seems to revive its policy of expansion step by step.

The Japanese defense budget (some 43 billion US dollars in 1994) is second only to America in the whole world. With the exception of America, within the Asia-Pacific area Japan owns the most advanced conventional weapons, such as F-15 fighters and Aegis destroyers. What is more notable is that Japan's huge industrial base enables it to manufacture nuclear weapons and other advanced military equipment in an extremely short time. PRC also worries that once Japan becomes one of the Permanent Members of the Security Council of United Nations, Japan will play a much more significant role on the Asian stage as well as the world stage.

Being neighbors with a nuclear armed PRC always makes Japan uneasy as it was previously attacked by atomic bombs.

Recently PRC has increased its purchase of military armament, to include its attempts to acquire or build an aircraft carrier. This in itself causes anxiety in Japan. The Persian Gulf provides Japan more than 70% of its imported fuel, and Japan's bilateral trade with Taiwan and Southeast Asian countries has been growing . The shipping routes that connect these areas with Japan are subject to interdiction by PRC. Therefore, it is predicted that Japan will continue to seek cooperation with America and some Asian-Pacific countries in order to curb PRC's expansion.

All in all, the expansion of economic, diplomatic and military power by either Japan or PRC will breed suspicion and increase tensions between them in the future.

## Prc And Korean Peninsula

For PRC, the Korean Peninsula is extremely important geopolitically. China dispatched more than 200,000 troops to enter the Korea War in October 1950. Before US/PRC
relations improved , North Korea had always served not only as the front line buffer zone for the PRC's confrontation with America, but also as an important base for Mainland China to stage resistance against Soviet expasion into Northeast Asia. Thus, PRC has always offered North Korea full support in both economic and foreign affairs.

The above situation lasted until the 1980s. Only after Deng Xiaoping came to power after the Gang of Four was ousted, did PRC proceed to improve its foreign policy and

to speed up its economic reforms. On the other side, Roe Tae-woo, assuming the Presidency of South Korea in 1988, aggressively promoted "Northern Policy" for fear that war could again break out on the Korean Peninsula. The aim of
''Northern Policy'' was to establish diplomatic relations with North Korea's two most vital supporters--the Soviet Union and PRC--as well as those communist countries in East Europe. Relations between China and South Korea developed rapidly. When the two countries established formal diplomatic relations in August 1992, PRC hoped to achieve its conspiracy of isolating ROC.

As diplomatic relations and trade contacts between PRC
and South Korea improved substantially, the diplomatic relation between PRC and North Korea degenerated. Since North Korea was dissatisfied with Mainland China's close interaction with South Korea, mutual relations between PRC and North Korea have fallen into the lowest level of the past forty years. It follows that North Korea's foreign aid from PRC was drastically reduced. However their relations will continue to be friendly. From PRC's point view, there are a limited number of communist governments in the contemporary world. Once Kim Il-sung's government changes, PRC
will be more isolated ideologically. In addition, North Korea possesses powerful armed forces and is currently involved in developing nuclear weapons. If they become hostile to each other, in desperation, North Korea could go to extremes and threaten PRC's security and benefits. PRC's attitude toward North Korean development of nuclear weapons apparently reveals its intention. When the UN Security Council took a vote on the question of North Korea's threatening to secede

from "the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty", PRC's delegation abstained from voting. This indicated that PRC wanted to keep a certain distance and not offend North Korea. In all likelihood PRC and North Korea will maintain friendly relations but it is impossible for them to return to the close and intimate relationship they enjoyed before.

## Prc And Southeast Asia

To PRC, Southeast Asia is a significant as well as a complicated area. This region adjoins the South China Sea in the east and the India Ocean in the west, with extremely important strategic status. This area, experiencing rapid economic development also becomes a potential market for Mainland China's merchandise. Moreover, because it borders on Indo-
China, Mainland China not only offered North Vietnam huge support during the Vietnam War but also provided long-term support for the Khmer Rouge who massacred numerous Cambodian. Beijing launched the so-called ''Punitive War against Vietnam'' in 1979. In order to achieve sovereignty over the Crescent Reef in the Paracel Islands and Fiery Reef in the Spratly Islands, PRC engaged in sea battles with South Vietnam and Vietnam respectively in 1974 and 1988. PRC emphasizes its sovereignty over the South China Sea area; consequently, PRC established outposts on uninhabited reefs to establish its sovereignty. PRC caused Vietnamese and ASEAN
alarm and reaped accusations as well as concerns from West Europe, America and Japan. In order to improve relations with Southeast Asian countries, PRC vigorously promoted mutual visits of high-level officials with these countries,

and repeatedly assured them PRC would not resort to force on the South China Sea issue. ASEAN also tried to prevent PRC from pursuing supremacy over Southeast Asia, especially over the South China Sea area, by inviting PRC to join in the "ASEAN Foreign Minister's Enlarged Meeting'' and
''Asia Regional Forum''. However, neither PRC nor Southeast Asian countries will make concessions over the controversial issue of ownership of the South China Sea. They continue to build airports and harbors, even prospect and exploit petroleum within the waters under their control.

Undoubtedly, unless the controversial issue of sovereignty over the South China Sea is resolved, the seemingly improved relationships between PRC and Southeast Asian countries are likely to change.

## The Current Status Of The Prc'S Armed Forces Ii. Current Military Strength

According to the PRC's "Military Service Law'', its armed forces are composed of The "PLA'', ''People's Armed Police and Militia Reserves''. Currently, the total number of armed forces approximately reaches 4,800,000 persons, including some 3,110,000 in the PLA, 1,000,000 in the People's Armed Police, and 700,000 in Militia Reserves.

In accordance with the "Armed Forces Reduction Program" developed in 1991 by the Central Military Council, the total strength of 3,200,000 troops will be reduced to 3,000,000.

## Army:

The current force of 2,300,000 troops are allocated to seven Military Regions, under which there are 24 army groups consisting mainly of some 80 infantry divisions, 20 tank divisions (brigades), 30 artillery divisions (brigades), and other combat support and service support forces. The Army's equipment includes some 12,000 tanks and armoured vehicles of every type, mostly T-59 II and T-69 tanks. In addition, there are some 15,000 pieces of towed artillery.

With respect to tactical missiles, M-9 and M-11 short-range mobile missiles (Table 1-6) have com-

## 62 Deployment

PRC's armed forces deployment is based on the strategy of "active defense" and in consideration of the geographic characteristics on Mainland China and the threat of the potential enemy, PRC employs seven military regions as the bulk force. (Chart 1-7) With the integration of air, naval and second artillery forces within the military region, a theater strategy concept is thus developed. The general strategic reserve is deployed in the vicinity of Beijing -- the seat of the central government. Other areas are organized into north, southeast and southwest Strategic Fronts. Combat readiness priority at the present stage has been adjusted, as first priority is given to southeast coastal area, second to the South China Sea, and third to the border region between India and Mainland China. Within each area adequate strength is assigned.

## 1. Ground Forces:

There are some 1,200,000 troops, most of which are crack units, deployed in the north of Mainland China (Shenyang, Beijing and Ningxia Military Regions) with the mission of defending against possible attack from Russia and acting as strategic general reserves. The southeastern area (the whole Nanjing Military Region), with the mission of defending against ROC's attacks, is deployed with some 320,000 troops, equivalent to the strength of the opposing ROC troops in that area. The southwestern area
(including Guangzhou and Chengdu Military Regions) are deployed with some 480,000 troops with the mission of defending against attacks from Vietnam and India. The

Center Military Region (the whole Jinan Military Region), serving as PRC's strategic reserve, is deployed with some 270,000 troops.

## 2.

Navy: (1)
The North Sea Fleet:
Its defense areas cover the Yellow Sea and the Pohai Gulf, with Lushun, Dalian, Yantai and Qingdao as its main bases. The Fleet deploys some 900 various types of vessels, most of which are huge warships and submarines.

(2)
The East Sea Fleet: Its defence areas cover the East China Sea and Taiwan Straits, with Shanghai, Dinghai, and Fuzhou as its main bases. The Fleet deploys some 900 vessels of various types, most being fast assault boats.

The South Sea Fleet:
Its defense areas cover the South China Sea, Paracel Islands and Spratly Islands, with Guangzhou, Zhanjiang, Yulin as its main bases. The Fleet is deployed with some 700 various types of vessels, most of which are amphibious vessels.

(3)

## C. Air Force:

The deployment of the Air Force is aimed primarily at defending against Russia and secondarily at defending against ROC and Vietnam. As to the bordering area adjacent to India, there are only a small number of air force units because of the limited bases available. Support forces will be dispatched from the heart land as conditions dictate.

Air Force Units employed for defending against
(1) 

## 64 Russia:

There are over 3,000 combat aircraft assigned to Shenyang, Beijing and Lanzhou Military Regions as the main force with the Jinan Military Region's air units serving as reserve. Many of the better aircraft, such as H-5, H-6, J-7, J-8 and Q-5 fighters, are stationed in these regions.

(2)
Air Force units employed for defending against Vietnam:
The air force units assigned to Chengdu and Guangzhou Military Regions, are employed to form a pair of pincers against Vietnam. Those areas within 300 nautical miles from Hanoi are normally deployed with about 300 fighters, of which the new model J-7 fighters serve as the advanced fighting forces.

Air Force units employed for operations against the Taiwan Strait:
Their deployment adopts the principle that "a
(3)
minimum number of troops are deployed on the front line while the main forces keep mobile''. Currently, within 250 miles from Taiwan, Mainland China has 13 air bases capable of accommodating more than 1,000 aircraft. However, under the Chinese Communists' ''united front'' strategy toward ROC, currently there are only about 100 fighters stationed in these 13 air bases. In the second line area, which is about 250 to 500 nautical miles from Taiwan, there are more than 20 air bases with over 1,500 combat aircraft of various types . This force can provide support to the 250 nautical mile front line

area of operation within one night. In addition, the 26 Su-27 fighters purchased from Russia currently are deployed in the south of Anhui Province. The maximum speed of Su-27 fighters reaches Mach 2.35 with a 1,500 kilometer combat radius, posing a sufficient threat to ROC's security.

The Second Artillery:
The Command of the Second Artillery is located in Beijing, with its strategic missile bases dispersed. The original principle of deployment focused on its primary target -- the Soviet Union. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, the deployment principally targets Russia while some of the ICBMs point at America. Moreover, PRC also deploys some Medium-range Ballistic Missiles targeted against America's forces stationed in Asia and its allied forces.

The effective range of these Medium-range Ballistic Missiles covers the Taiwan area.

## Iii. Prc'S Arms Expansion

PRC's arms expansion integrates the adjustment of their strategic concept, an increase in the defense budget, renewal of weapons systems and the enhancement of troop training and maneuvers.

## The Adjustment Of Strategic Concept

PRC emerged through guerrilla warfare. After establishing its regime, PRC continued to adopt "People's War" as its defense strategy, ready to conduct an all-out war with the

## D. Chart 1-7 The Deployment Of Prc'S Armed Forces

![90_image_0.png](90_image_0.png)

enemy. Therefore, PRC concentrated on the buildup of a massive army to lure the enemy to penetrate deeply into inland areas when necessary and then completely annihilate the enemy by means of guerrilla warfare and human-wave tactics. Under this strategy, although in 1964 PRC accomplished the first nuclear bomb test-launch and established its nuclear attack forces step by step, PRC adopts defensive strategy and PRC's Army remains its main body forces. The PRC's Navy adopts "active defense, littoral operation'' as its strategic guideline, and sets its goal on defending the littoral areas of China. Although successfully testing the first atomic bomb in 1964 and establishing its nuclear strike forces step by step, the still adopted a defensive strategy and the Army remained the main force. Of course, because its industrial base development is falling behind other countries, PRC is unable to develop advanced fighters and warships for the buildup of effective naval and air operations, which would in turn influence its strategy development. For example, the PRC's Navy initially intended to build up a large quantity of topedo boats, but in later years it turned to buildng a large quantity of fast attack boats (missile). This indicates that the PRC not only apply the concept of ''People's War'' strategy but also accommodate the reality of lacking of the large advance surface vessels.

Although it successfully penetrated into northern provinces of North Vietnam during the "Punitive War against Vietnam'' in 1979, PRC's out-of-date equipment and obsolescent tactics resulted in heavy casualities. PRC proceeded to examine its defense strategy after this war and determined that it was urgent to develop the capability to fight a limited

war beyond Mainland China's border, and especially to improve the capability for joint operations conducted by Navy and Air Force. From then on, PRC has emphasized defense modernization. The "Central Military Council Enlarged Conference'' was held in 1985 in which concensus was reached that the possibility of world war breaking out before 2000 A.D. was very slim, but local war induced by local conflicts would not be avoided. Hence, the PRC's Modernization Concept puts stress on economic development so as to enhance its national power and on rebuilding of the armed forces and improving of weapons and equipment based on the principle of ''Integration of War and Peace Time Efforts.'' As regards the "Major military regions'', they will serve as the principal structural frame of the military buildup. Strategic thinking also began to change, which impacted on its sea power development concept. PRC wants to strengthen the development of its Navy to protect its exclusive economic zone of several million square kilometers of territorial waters and continental shelf, the shore line of about 18,000 kilometers and 65,000 islands. After assuming the post of commander-in-chief of the Navy in 1982, Liu Hua-Qing gave a renewed definition of ''active defense, littoral operation'' which emphasized conventional Naval strategy; he opined that the PRC should not be satisfied with defending " littoral areas", but should be ready to execute operations on the high seas.

However, Liu also emphasized that any operations, whether on the sea or on the ground, must receive sufficient support from the Air Force. Since military modernization was initiated in 1980, the PRC's Navy and Air Force got a larger share of the allocation of budget and force structure:

meanwhile, the number of joint exercise conducted by the Navy and Air Force markedly increased, as did blue water maneuvers by naval ships. The PRC's new strategy of power projection was especially reflected in its policy toward the South China Sea.

Though the PRC's Army temporarily has got a smaller share of the budget and force structure, Beijing did not overlook the importance of the Army; therefore, the combat power of the Artillery, Armor, Army Aviation Corps and Corps of Chemical Defense was steadily strengthened.

## The Increase Of Defense Budget

It is by no means easy to calculate PRC's defense budget.

The PRC's military has various means of making money, including manufacturing daily necessities, running tourist hotels, even investing in overseas enterprises. The PRC's military circle also earns a large amount of foreign exchange through arms sales and the export of military technology. PRC earned about 2 billion US dollars through arms sales in 1992.

There has been a massive increase of PRC's defense budget in recent years. Since 1988, the PRC's defense budget has increased 60% to 98% while the retail prices rose only 32%
during the same period. The PRC's announced defense budget reached 6.5 billion US dollars in 1992 while its real defense spending reached about 12–24 billion US dollars in that year.

In analyzing the PRC's defense budget, which is promulgated annually and claimed by the PRC to be lower than that of other countries, care must be taken to see that the retail prices in Mainland China are much lower than those

in other countries, and in addition, the pay scale for the PRC's Armed Forces is far lower than that for other countries' army. Thus, the PRC's real defense spending not only enables PRC to sustain the largest army in the world, but also to engage in their own research and development of new weapon systems and to import military equipment from Russia.

## The Renewal Of Weapon Systems

PRC has spent a large quantity of resources on the establishment of its defense industry for several decades. For the time being, its defense industry can not only provide PRC's military with sufficient conventional weapons but can also export them for foreign exchange. Additionally, PRC has attained considerable achievements in the research and development of nuclear weapons.

By copying various types of Soviet/Russia-made fighters, PRC is able to manufacture J–6, J–7, H–5 and Q–5 fighters; furthermore, it has even cooperated with America to improve its J-8 fighters. As to the development of sea vessels, PRC
has the capability to manufacture nuclear submarines by itself, including one Xia-class SSBN and five Han-class SSN. China also produced 17 destroyers and 37 escorts, of which some are equipped with landing and take-off systems for onboard helicopters; most are equipped with ship to ship missiles. Ad- 1 ditionally, PRC retains 200 fast attack boats (missile).

PRC's troops are armed with several types of nuclear weapons. Not long ago they successfully developed the SLBM
Chulang (Swell) II with a range up to 8,000 kilometers. More recently, PRC has deployed Dong Feng 21A (DF–21A) medium

-range missiles with a range up to 1,800 kilometers. This is the first time PRC adopted mobile launching pads for the delivery of medium range missiles.

Before the eruption of the Tiananmen Square incident on 4 June 1989, PRC had purchased arms and military technology from the West. After Tiananmen, the West cut off military trade with PRC. However, economic deterioration in the former Soviet Union and Russia provided PRC
an opportunity for renewed weapons acquisition. Russia has recently sold PRC about 26 Su–27 fighters, some T–72 tanks, 10 Ilyushin-76 transport planes and 4 S-300 (SA300) surfaceto-air missiles. Due to the recession of Russia's economy, Moscow is exerting an all-out effort to market its weapons for foreign capital. In November 1993, a "Five-year Military Cooperation Agreement" between PRC and Russia was.signed when Russia's Defense Minister visited Beijing in November 1993. It is predicted that PRC will purchase more military equipment from Russia, to include Kilo-class submarines with the capability of launching air-defense missiles, T-72 tanks and the manufacturing know-how for Mig-29 and Mig-31 fighters.

In discussing how PRC will renew its weapon systems, emphasis should not be laid solely on the purchase of military equipment. In fact, PRC has purchased much military technology from Russia as well as hired many industry experts for work in Mainland China. Their work covers an extensive field ranging from the development of nuclear weapons and cruise missiles, to battle tanks and ASW equipment. PRC
has always been good at copying Russian weapons and over time, the capability of the PRC's weapons will be greatly

upgraded. (Table 1-7)

## The Enhancement Of Troop Training And Maneuver

Since early 1992 China has intensified the combat capabilities of troops in rapid response, electronic warfare, three-dimension warfare, long-range movement converging assault and joint combined warfare, and night operations based on the principle of 'strengthening the tactical training of combined operation and promoting over-all combat capability''. (Table 1-8) Of these exercises conducted recently, the
"934'' maneuver conducted in Guangdong Military Region from June to September 1993 and the "Chengjung No. 3" maneuver conducted in Nanjing Military Region from July to November 1993 are particularly noteworthy." The "934''
maneuver was the largest in scale and the participating troops, weapons and equipment were much larger in number than before. The form of the exercise also had great differences from the past, mainly to examine the capabilities of fast attack and amphibious landing in warfare. These should provide solid proof that PRC is likely to make preparations for seizure of islands in the South China Sea or other offshore islands.

## Impact Of The Prc'S Arms Expansion Iv.

The large-scale expansion of the PRC armaments has caused anxiety in the Asian Region. History has revealed that the PRC's prime consideration in waging external war is based on its political interests not on military power. PRC would consider using military power externally even when its militarity was in poor condition. Thus, Asian countries worry that, along with the rapid expansion of its military power, the Beijing Regime's will and capability for pursuing Expansionist Policies in Asia will be heightened. The PRC's adoption a high-statured position in dealing with the sovereignty problem of the South China Sea has proven that the concerns shown by the Asians are not groundless. For self-defense, many nations have made Asia the area of most rapid arms expansion.

The Republic of China has experienced the greatest impact of the PRC's arms expansion. In the face of PRC strengthening its military power on one hand and threatening the use of force against Taiwan on the other, ROC is compelled to maintain a defense capability sufficient for selfprotection. Without the threat from PRC, most national resources could be applied to other fields of national reconstruction.

The South East Asian countries commonly worry about the military withdrawal of Russia and the United States from that region, the military growth of PRC as well as the overseas deployment of Japanese defense force. Most East Asian and South East Asian countries still have a varying amount of national debts in spite of their rapid economic development.

Yet for promoting their security, they all list a massive defense budget for purchasing weapons. On the other hand, based on the knowledge that an arms race can easily stir up armed conflict, some Asian countries have proposed to establish a security system for promoting peace within the region.

## V. Conclusion

The strategic environment of PRC includes its relationships with the Unițed States, Russia, Japan, the Korean Peninsula and South East Asia. As to the tie between the PRC
and the United States, the dissolution of the Soviet Union has reduced the PRC's strategic value; arms expansion, export of sensitive weapons, aggressiveness in the South China Sea, benefit of the trade surplus from America, supression of human rights and so forth, have all exacerbated the relationship between them. However, due to the fact that mutual need still exists between PRC and the United States, their relations have improved recently. The link between PRC and Russia has been improved by the dissolution of the Soviet Union; consequently PRC has started importing advanced weapons and defense technology from CIS, hence the amount of trading and military purchasing continue rising. The ties between PRC and Japan are friendly but superficial. Both of them are anxious about each other's warfighting potential and arms expansion plans. Since Beijing and South Korea established formal diplomatic relations, their commercial transactions are also on the rise. As a result, the association between PRC and North Korea has turned cold; however a certain degree of friendship will be maintained, because North

Korea needs PRC's diplomatic support. RPC fears that discord between them would damage its security interest. Southeast Asia is very significant to PRC from the strategic viewpoint.

The Southeast Asian Region is strategically important to PRC and relationships between PRC and the countries in this region are getting better. Nevertheless the sovereignty issue in the South China Sea is likely to again trigger the conflicts among them. Presently the PRC national defense budget is rising sharply. Military Maneuvers are conducted from time to time. Besides its own research and development for various types of combat aircraft, warships and strategic missiles, PRC also imports a great amount of advanced weapons from Russia.

Particularly noteworthy is the purchase of military technology and inviting military exports from Russia. The PRC's weapon capabilities and functions will surely be upgraded over time.

Generally speaking, PRC arms expansion is the key factor for instability in the Asian Region.

PRC frequently holds a variety of exercises; the exercise held in Zanjiang on March 4, 1993 especially caught the attention of the outside world. The scale of the exercise was larger than previous military maneuvers; multiple services engaged in this exercise . What is more important, fast attack troops took part in the exercise and an amphibious landing exercise was also performed.

China's military buildup has caused anxiety among neighboring countries, which is the main cause of the arms race in Asia. On the other hand, to reduce the risk of war, Asian countries began discussing the possibility of establishing a common security system. The Asian Region Forum will be held in May,1994. Unfortunately, the Republic of China,

Mongolia, North Korea, Cambodia and Burma were not invited to attend the meeting. Any ideal security system requires that all members pledge not to resort to war in solving conflict; however, Mainland China will by no means make such a promise.

2.

The defensive policy of Armed Forces update is "defensive posture''.

ROC on Taiwan is to programme and establish a defensive force with less manpower but better quality and total combat effectiveness.

3.

The force objective for the next decade (1994–2003) will be below 400,000 men.

# Chapter 1 National Security

National security is the foremost objective of any state and regime. President Lee Teng-hui has pointed out that
"Without national security, we have nothing. Without national security, there is no way for national construction.

Even if the construction has been completed, it could be destroyed by the enemy overnight."

## Objectives Of National Defense I.

The main objective of national defense is to protect the national security from being violated and threatened. In the process of pursuing national security, it is impossible for any given country to obtain absolute safety, because as soon as one country obtains absolute safety, other neighoring countries around it would conversely have a feeling of absolute unsafety. In such an interaction of relative security, recognizing the existence of external threats is the first step in maintaining national security. At present, the main threats to the ROC's security basically are:
1.

The PRC's use of force against Taiwan; 2.

Territorial split; Regional conflicts.

3.

Of those, undoubtedly, the direct and most serious threat that could endanger our society is the PRC's use of force against Taiwan. Therefore, how to defend against and defeat a planned invasion by PRC has become the most critical objective of national defense. In addition, the national defense at the current stage should protect the following interests of ROC on Taiwan:
Under the stipulation of the ROC Constitution, to l. 2. 3.

safeguard all rights and interests, and to reach the goal of national unification; To ensure our territorial integrity and sovereignty; To maintain economic prosperity and social stability.

## The Prc Threat Ii. Intention Of Invading Roc On Taiwan

Even the two parties across the Taiwan Straits have now been actively engaged in the positive development in every. aspect of trade and culture, the PRC's authorities have never abandoned their intention of invading ROC on Taiwan. Recently, the so-called White Paper on "the Taiwan Issue and China's Unification'' published by PRC has only repeated their cliches such as, "one country two systems", "highly self-governed'', ''peace talk'', but refuses the promise to give up the use of force against ROC on Taiwan. In addition, they resort to every conceivable means to suppress and isolate us in the international community, while reinforce their own combat readiness, purchase advanced weapon systems, enhance the amphibious warfare capability, and draw up various operational plans of ''liberating Taiwan,'' so that they can invade ROC on Taiwan by force if necessary.

## Opportune Moment For Invading Taiwan

From the speeches delivered by the PRC leadership in recent years, we can identify as many as six different scenarios of action that PRC would take as the most opportune time to invade ROC on Taiwan:
If and when ROC on Taiwan declares itself l.

''independent'';
2.

If and when an internal upheaval occurs on the island; If and when the ROC Armed Forces on Taiwan becomes 3.

comparatively weak; If and when any foreign power interferes in ROC on 4.

Taiwan's internal affairs; 5.

If and when ROC on Taiwan protractedly refuses to talk with them about the issue of unification, and 6.

If and when ROC on Taiwan develops nuclear weapons.

Among these circumstances, the most likely one under which PRC would invade is if and when ROC on Taiwan declares itself independent, and that is also the most dangerous one to ROC on Taiwan. Based on both historic and national sentiments, and concerns that "Taiwan independence" would encourage a consciousness of separatism among the people in Tibet, Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, the PRC leaders at all levels must use force to preclude "Taiwan independence".

At the same time, once ROC on Taiwan declares independence, it will doubtlessly cause internal upheavals on the island and thereby weaken the ROC on Taiwan's defensive strength.

History proves that it is very difficult for a government with internal upheavals to successfully repulse a formidable enemy's invasion. Another aspect to watch out is the stability of PRC's leading echelons. If the inner structure of the PRC leadership is changed, the new leaders must give the military more say in internal and foreign affairs in order to pacify them.

Therefore, PRC military commanders could use this advantage to ask its leaders to take a harder stance in the South China Sea and towards ROC on Taiwan issues.

## Actions Of Invading Roc On Taiwan ·

In a broad sense, the courses of action that PRC may

88 take for invading ROC on Taiwan can be divided into nonmilitary and military ones. Nonmilitary action, as a matter of fact, has been unceasingly underway for quite a long time. By means of steadily disintegrating and instigating internal subversion, dwarfing ROC on Taiwan in the international community, weakening ROC on Taiwan 's economic strength, and eroding the psychological defense of ROC on Taiwan's military and civilians, they have long been attempting to seize ROC on Taiwan.With regard to the development of relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits, Beijing is adopting the following measures:(a)cajoling the people of ROC
on Taiwan to put more pressure on the government;(b) instigating businessmen to envelop political leaders; and(c) calling to Chinese Communist Party; with the objective is to peacefully reunify Mainland China and ROC on Tạiwan. In the event these measures fail or the desired ambition fails to accomplish; to force peace talks by means of war , and to force reunification by means of armed forces might be brought about. Concrete actions might include the following:
Deploy operational aircraft to bases along the southeast l.

coast of Mainland China, west of Taiwan, with the aim of affecting social stability, industrial production, and harassing the morale of the people of ROC on Taiwan. Launch their intermediate -- range missiles (with a range 2.

of 300-600 Km) against the west coast of Taiwan. Even with limited accuracy, the attack would definitely cause psychological shock among the people.

Create fishing disputes in the Taiwan Straits or sieze 3.

Taiwan's fishing areas; then send their naval vessels under the excuse of protect their fishing boats to repulse Taiwan's 4.

5.

fishing boats so as to gain control of the Taiwan Straits.

Raid Taiwan's supply ships by motored fishing boats, naval vessels, or aircraft to cause and expand trouble.

Occupy the Pratas, Wu-Chiou, Matsu and Kimen islands through assault warfares under the principle of nonemploying large amount of troops.

Launch a regular and irregular large-scale attack on 6.

Taiwan.

They could take the above military actions respectively or collectively depending on the international situations as well as the internal situations of the two sides across the Taiwan Straits.

## Capabilities Of Invading Roc On Taiwan

Strategically, in evaluating the enemy, one should judge from their capability rather than the possibility of their intention. Ever since PRC started carrying out their "defense modernization'' policy in late 1970s, the combat strength of their armed forces has been increasing greatly. In addition, the collapse of the former Soviet Union and relaxation on Sino-Vietnamese relations has made it possible for PRC to redeploy military strength from those two frontiers to the area in front of ROC on Taiwan, thus enhancing their capability to invade ROC on Taiwan.

## Possible International Response To A Prc Invasion Of Roc On  Taiwan

In spite of the fact that the new international order has

gradually been formed and international morality is also valued high, the principle of safeguarding one's own interests first in dealing with international affairs is still unchanged among nations. In the dispute between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits, most countries in the world hold that ROC on Taiwan is a part of China and disputes should be settled peacefully by the Chinese themselves. All three key documents signed by the U.S. and the PRC regime––the Shanghai Communique (1972), the Joint Communique on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations(1978), and the Joint Communique of August 17 (1982) -- have also emphasized this stand. Hence, if PRC violates this agreement, the United States could, in view of the spirit of the ''Taiwan Relations Act'', weigh the PRC threat toward ROC on Taiwan and the damage it would impose on U.S. interests, and adopt appropriate contermeasures.

Secondly, since Japan maintains very close economic and trade relations with ROC on Taiwan, a stable and prosperous ROC on Taiwan will certainly be in accordance with Japan's economic interest. Additionally, with the strategic location of the Taiwan Straits being closely related to Japan's economic and trade lifeline, Japan is certainly unwilling to see any kind of war or even chaos occur in this area. Since Japan is the most important U.S. ally in Asia, Tokyo's attitude will inevitably influence Washington's decision on what action it would take if and when ROC on Taiwan is invaded by PRC.

South Korea at present has established formal diplomatic relations with PRC. The trade between those two is also steadily mounting. Therefore, South Korea would be

definitely unwilling to see ROC on Taiwan invaded. Once PRC seizes ROC on Taiwan, it would encourage North Korea to also follow the PRC's step to pursue a policy of unifying Korea by means of military.

With a rapid increase of Taiwan capital being invested in Southeast Asian countries in recent years, up to $15 billions at present, the relations of trade and others between the countries in this area and ROC on Taiwan have become much closer. Since most of the Southeast Asian countries had in the past suffered greatly from Communist rebellion and/or subversion, almost all of them would think that a stable and firm ROC on Taiwan contributes to their own economic development. Besides, if ROC on Taiwan were occupied by PRC, they would naturally increase their ability to control the South China Sea area. Thus, Southeast Asian countries would appeal to the U.S. to prevent PRC from using force against ROC on Taiwan.

Since freedom-loving and democratic countries in Western Europe also have increasingly close economic and trade ties with ROC on Taiwan, it is believed that they will not sit by and remain indifferent toward PRC's using force against a democratic and prosperous ROC on Taiwan. They can be expected to cooperate with the U. S. in adopting measures necessary to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan region.

Generally speaking, the international response to a PRC's invasion of ROC on Taiwan is what most countries in the world are unwilling to see. But should, one day, PRC
outrageously take rash action without thinking of any serious consequences, and rapidly settle the war situation, then it will probably be the case that these nations would accept

the fact of PRC's occupying ROC on Taiwan. Hence, the essential way to maintain ROC on Taiwan's stability is to build up its own strength to resist threats imposed from PRC.

# National Defense Organization

## I. Enactment Of The Defense Organization Law

Since defense affairs range in a broad sense, it is far beyond the capability of MND to develop policies and to carry out those policies alone. To successfully execute defense affairs and ensure national security, it has been generally perceived in ROC that it is necessary to initiate a set of appropriate Defense Organization Law based upon Clause 3, Article 137 of the ROC Constitution.

MND, having proceeded with the study of Defense Organization Law in accordance with President Chiang Kaishek's instructions in 1950, drew up "the Draft of National Organization Law'' and its amendment in 1950 and 1952 respectively, and presented them to the Executive Yuan and Legislative Yuan for review and approval. Later the Executive Yuan and Legislative Yuan disagreed over some significant issues, which resulted in the two drafts being put aside. In 1971, the Executive Yuan considered that the above two drafts were not suitable to be applied to the social environment and withdrew them from the Legislative Yuan. On April 5 of the same year, the Legislative Yuan replied to the Executive Yuan approving the withdrawal. In view of the fact

that the "Organization Law of MND'' (being initiated in 1970)
and the "Organization Law of the General Staff Headquarters, MND'' (being initiated in 1978) have been respectively published and carried out; the rules authorized by the two drafts have established every military organization the stipulations to organize, allocate and employ the armed forces; and the running of national defense system has been effective, MND
ceased to amend the ''Defense Organization Law'' for review and approval by the Executive Yuan. However, MND's efforts on the study of the development of "Defense Organization Law'' is still on the go.

In March 1993, soon after the Executive Yuan decreed that MND should call on various units concerned to quickly develop the draft of ''National Defense Organization Law''
subject to approval by the Executive Yuan, MND proceeded to the development of the organization work of defense forces, legitimacy of the chain of command, initiation of ROC's national defense policy, establishment of the guiding agency for defense policy, operational styles of military administration and military order, acquisition of defense sources, mobilization during war time, combat readiness during peace time, process of executing general mobilization, and the establishment of civil defense force; moreover MND referring to related theories, taking the current situation into consideration, integrated all opinions by holding several discussions, and finally completed the draft of the "National Defense Organization Law'', which has been presented to the Executive Yuan for review and approval. Once the Legislative Yuan concurs the draft, MND, based upon the draft, will revise related laws and the regulations of organization. With

this, defense affairs will progress smoothly and the mission of assuring national security will be fulfilled.

## Ii. Actuation Of The Legalization Of The Regulations Affiliated To National Defense

The objectives of legalizing the regulations affiliated to National Defense lies in corresponding with the execution of the National Defense Policies so as to improve the quality of the laws, to strengthen the information management, and to arrive at the degree of its comprehensive, flawless and absolute realization.

To effectively carry out the program of national defense laws, in 1972 MND enacted the "Principles for the Constitution of the regulations of the National Defense'' as a foundation for regulation management and constricted the formation of new enactments. In addition to the matters related to individual rights and obligations, or the necessity of proceeding through the legislative procedure, no new rules will be established in order to prevent misuse. Any regulation not processed according to valid legislative procedure and not issued in the name of Minister of the National Defense will not be valid so as to enhance supervision and establish integrity and authority of the law. Meanwhile, important matters concerning leadership, educational training, duty assignment and others, or the regulation which must be formulated by varied services according to the policies of the Ministry of National Defense should be submitted to MND for approval before issuing.

Subsequent actions were taken among which includes a

review of the current laws redundant and obsolete. Based on the principles of the essentialities, large scale law amendment and examination are underway with a focus being placed on simplicity. From July, 1987, as the Martial Law of Taiwan Area was lifted to December, 1993, the total 216 items of regulations have been refined into 174 ones, and the expected objective has been generally accomplished. Hereafter, the execution of the National Defense Policies will follow the ordinance of the national defense "Administration and Proceeding Abide by Law."

## Iii. Adjustment Of Military Organization

The military structure of our armed forces was patterned after the mission-oriented practices of the Government of the ROC well before Mainland China fell to the Communists.

After the Government moved to Taiwan, the military structure remained very large because of the need of offensive operations. During these years, in keeping with the change of the strategic situation, the Government has reduced the number of soldiers several times; currently, we will proceed with an in-depth adjustment of our military mission, its functions and responsibilities in order to enhance our performance effectiveness under the climate of retrenchment. Our adjustment is described as follows:

Since the Government announced the termination of the Period of National Mobilization for Suppression of the Communist Rebellion, the Taiwan Garrison Command, seeing the phased mission completed, was deactivated on July 31, 1992.

Organization of Coastal Patrol Army:
Taiwan and Penghu Islands (the Pescadores) are surrounded by seas. The execution of coastal patrol directly affects our nationl security, but the power and responsibility for coastal patrol have yet been clearly defined. In order to perform mission, MND organized the Coastal Patrol Command by selecting personnel from ground forces on August 1, 1992. Its organization was composed of eight local commands and 25 patrol Battlaions.

Meanwhile, MND transferred the mission of coastal patrol to the Taiwan Military Reserve Command to facilitate coordination and execution of the mission.

Retrenchment of the General Headquarters:
Based on the current strategic concept switched from offensive operation to defensive deterence, the existing overlap of duties at all levels in the General Staff, MND, as well as the staff units of varied service general headquarters has not only wasted unit strength but also affected command efficiency. In order to carry out the comprehensive retrenchment plan, MND is going to review various staff units under the General Staff, MND,
and varied services with the same nature and the repeated functions within a short period. Command authority will be primarily centralized in the General Staff of MND, while the training responsibility will be delegated to service-level general headquarters to enhance effectiveness. Phasing-out the Non-Combatant Units:
Faced with a restrained defense budget and the pressing 3.

4. 2.

need to modernize weapon systems, the key aim of force restructuring is to preserve the combatant units.

Henceforth, some of the non-combatant units, such as publishing, printing, broadcasting (film), entertainment, post exchange, and production, are considered to be retrenched first; then, converted to private owned business. Giving thought to the tendency of the legalization and nationalization of military forces, the special services such as electronic surveilliance, postal examination, intelligence, counter–intelligence, social investigation, public security and so forth, will also be delegated to units outside of MND. Thus, the numbers of personnel and funding of non-combatant units can be reduced, while overall combat power increases.

## Iv. Enhancement Of The Organization Of The Civil Defense

Civil defense is defined as national defense in a broad sense. Its main purpose is to manage the civil affairs relating to the protection, shelter, disaster relief and others. It also carries the responsibility to maintain the leadership of government and support military action during the state of emergency. Hence, civil defense and military defense could be viewed as the two pillars of national security.

Our civil defense system was modelized when in October 1946 the Air Defense Command of Taiwan was established. After having been integrated into the National Police Administration affiliated to the Ministry of Interior in March 1973, the civil defense system has gone through several reorganizations and was supervised by the Taiwan Garrison

Command. After the "Period of Mobilization and Suppression of the Chinese Communists'' was terminated, the Taiwan Garrison Command was deactivated on August 31, 1992. The Executive Yaun also deactivated the ''Regulations of the Civil Defense during the National Mobilization Period'' and all the duties of civil defense was taken over by the Ministry of Interior. The current law of civil defense affairs was based on the bylaws of the ''Law of the Air Defense in Execution''.

However, civil defense is still carried out in accordance with the "Air Defense Law'' formulated in 1948. As this law is outdated, the Executive Yuan instructed the Ministry of Interior to formulate the "Civil Defense Law". Having passed through the Legislative Yuan, the "Air Defense Law" and the bylaws of the ''Law of Air Defense in Execution'' were deactivated. Thus far civil defense and military defense can complement each other and collective security can be achieved.

## I. The Concept Of Defensive Posture For The Armed Forces Buildup

Based on the requirements of national security, and adherence to the logical thinking of military strategy, the prospect of future international environment, technological evolution, external threat, and the nation's defense capabilities, the concept of our armed forces buildup is thus formed and serves as the guidance for war "readiness.

Due to the changes in the political environment, the concept of our armed forces buildup has been transformed from the strategy of "offensive-defensive as one" to "defensive defense''. Consequently, based on the estimate of the form of war in the Taiwan Straits in the future, the logical thinking of how to train, equip, organize the forces and how to fight, the overall strategic situation, the guidance of the assessment of regional military threats, and ROC capabilities, building the armed forces will establish the second generation force, able to deter external aggression effectively, response to contingency quickly, and ensure natioal security with less manpower but better quality of personnel and more sophisticated equipment.

## 101 Ii. Force Obejective Programming In The Next Decade

Under the guidance of the concept of defensive defense for armed forces buildup, and by estimating future requirements, manpower, and financial capability, the force objective through next decade(1994-2003) is below 400,000 men. By the year 2003, the total strength of our armed forces will account for 1. 7% of the whole population (it is estimated that total population by then will reach 22 million), conforming with other democratic nations whose total number of forces does not exceed 2% of its population.

As to the allocation of strength among the three services, it will be done according to the priority of the mission of air superiority and sea control in defensive operations, and the requirement of coast defense.

Since the force structure programming involves complicated aspects and has significant implications, the work should not be done in a hasty manner so as to undermine national security. A ten-year period of programming will be implemented in three phases to keep abreast with the current situation, future trend, the modernization of weaponry and the enhancement of firepower. In the process, a step-by-step review and sound planning will create a "lean but effective force''. The working objective and phased efforts are as follows:
Phase I: develop a reasonable T/O for the three services, so as to facilitate training and the execution of peace-time missions.

Phase II: adjust staff organizations, eliminate those military schools that are overlapping in efforts, so the three

service GHQs' can operate in the same compound to expedite command and control.

Phase III: consolidate the General Staff, MND, and the three service GHQs, transferring non-military tasks to organizations outside MND with the purpose of developing a sound force structure of the all armed forces to keep a military force below 400,000 troops.

## Iii. The Project For Integrating And Building The Weapon Systems In The Future

Based on the guiding principles of building our armed forces , projects for weapon system acquisitions in the coming five years are as follows:
Control of the Air: Replace aging aircraft with advanced 1.

fighter jets acquired abroad and locally manufactured. Purchase of airborne early warning aircraft (AWACS)
and various airborne weapon systems, in keeping with the completion of "Sky Net" air defense system. Modernize surface-to-air missiles, in order to automate command and control and integrate air defense systems. Purchase additional transport aircraft to enhance airlift capability.

Control of the Sea: The Navy will build the-second2.

generation surface combat ships such as missile frigates, missile patrol frigates, coastal patrol boats, and lease the KNOX-class frigates from the U.S. The additional purchase of submarines and shore-based anti-ship missiles is intended to enhance counter-blockade capability by onboard missiles and weapon systems, automate the process in

3.

command and control, and afford three-dimensional anti-submarine warfare.

Counter-landing operations: Upgrade basic weapon systems used by the ground forces, and electronics in C3I. Produce M48H "Tiger" tanks, purchase attack helicopters and recon-helicopter to achieve the goal of a counter-landing operations with the capabilities of mobilization, three-dimension, and automation on the battlefield.

## Iv. The Guidance For Defensive Operation

Based upon the principles of being ''sustained in strategy and quick in tactics'', ROC will conduct its defensive operations independently with the morale and people's allegiance as the decisive factor. Mobilization of reserves and employment of total combat power including air defense, sea defense, and ground defense will create a superior force to repel an invading enemy for national security. The main points are as follows:
1.  Air defensive operations:
The main focus is on long range surveillance and effective control of early warning. The threats imposed by enemy aircraft that trepass on our air space must be reduced to the lowest level. At the beginning of an defensive operation, ROC's Air Force, through its rapid counterattack capabilities, must deter enemy aircarft that invade into our space to prevent any destruction generated by the enemy aircraft. Meanwhile, ROC's Air Force must restrain and enervate enemy's ground or naval troops,

and offer close support to our naval and army troops in the field to command the air-superiority.

2.

Maritime defense operations:
Emphasis will be placed on naval supermacy. Accordingly, beside the necessary picketing, minesweeping , patroling and escorting, main efforts are used to develop safe passages to counter an enemy blockade and keep the sea lane free from threats. To avail the execution of naval defense, ROC's Navy must protect the security of important harbors, coasts and the significant coastal areas as well as timely intercept and enervate the combat strength of enemy's maritime.

3.

Land defense operations:
While air and sea defensive measures may not completely or effectively stop an enemy's advance, land defensive operations is the last resort to win the war and safeguard national security. By means of strengthened fortifications and a dispersion of troops, the mission of defense as well as the prevention of being assaulted by the enemy will be effectively achieved and the decisive striking capability sustained. The selection of priority targets based on interior line operations will enable ground forces to destroy the enemy in the waters and coastal areas one by one through the employment of mobile, rapid and decisive strategy. Additionally, by actively developing effective measures to restrain the enemy's irregular operations and specific equipment, ROC's ground forces will solidify their capability in counter-landing operations.

# Defense  Budget

## Defense Budget And National Security I.

President Lee Teng-hui said: ''There will be no security without strength; and there will be no prosperity without security.'' Indeed, the base of national survival and development is security. But the strength to maintain national security requires the concrete and substantial support of a sufficient defense budget, without which security will become nothing but a fancy that would be hazardous to the country.

For the past two years, as the collapse of the Soviet Union, the era of bi-polar cold war confrontation has ended. Most nations the world over are striving for economic development, arms reduction, and military down sizing, but the principal countries in the Asian–Pacific area such as PRC, Japan, South Korea, and North Korea are undertaking a contrary approach. They have increased their defense budgets and expanded their military strength dramatically. According to the published figures released by PRC, the annual growth of their defense budget is approx. 13.5% this year . Their total military outlay is about double that of five years ago, and they also plan to maintain an annual growth rațe of 10% or more from now on. The defense budget growth rate of Japan is 3.8%

this year, and South Korea, 12.9%. (Chart 3-1). 

In view of our situation during these years, due to the shortage of fiscal income, our defense budget has been reduced year by year; especially in FY/1994, showing a negative growth rate of about 4.65%, which has a tremendous impact on the existent plan for the buildup of our force structure.

The situation we now confront is that PRC and other surrounding countries are undergoing rigorous military expansion, and our national security is seriously threatened.

Therefore, we would like to make an appeal to all our countrymen that your support to the defense budget is a substantial act of preservation of national security and promotion of the prosperity of our society.

## Budget Management

1.

At the beginning of FY/ 1993, the defense budget was administered under strict and rigorous control according to existing plans and objectives. However, during midyear, certain measures were taken to review, delete, and postpone some projects in order to transfer from the budget a sum of 16,552(NTD in millions) for the procurment of high-performance fighters. The remainder of the budget has been administered adhering to the principle of stringency and austerity. Summing up, the FY/1993 budget leaves 5,822.07(NTD in millions) in reserve which amounted to 2% of the budget authorized. There was a leftover of about 3,185.920(NTD in millions) to be returned to the government which amounted to approx.

1% of the total budget. All these figures are smaller than those of the FY/1992, demonstrating that the administration of the budget is now more realistic and effective than before.

The management of the defense budget in FY/1994 will primarily focus on the procurement of major weapons and equipment as well as construction. A "Managerial Data System'' will be used to enhance the efficiency of budget administration, and to reduce the rate of budget reserve, so that the defense budget can function more effectively.

## Improving Direction

1.

Continuation of the measures taken to increase the pro2.

portion of unclassified budget items: The percentage of classified items in the FY/1994 budget
(45.59%) is lower than that of FY/1992 (51.01%). This policy of including more budget items in the unclassified category will be continued in order to obtain more public support.

2.

Reduction of the proportion of the budget for personnel upkeep:
Since there is negative growth in the defense budget in FY/1994, the proportion of the budget for personnel upkeep in the entire budget structure appears to rise minimally. It is therefore decided that the proportion of the budget for personnel upkeep will be reduced gradually to a limit below 40% to make it more reasonable, while keeping pace with the progress of the
"10-year Streamline Project Objectives" of the force structure.

## Special Budget For Procurement Of High Performance Iii. Fighters

Air defense is the first line of national defense. Due to the principal fighters of our Air Force are becoming obsolete, the supply of their spare parts and accessories is getting more and more difficult, and their in-commission rate has been declining. Consequently, a gap in national combat capability is generated. On the other hand, PRC is in the process of immensely strengthening their air combat capability by purchasing high performance fighters such as SU-27, and MIG–31, and by improving the combat capability of their "F-8"

fighters. These developments have become a tremendous threat to the security of our air defense. We have tried to procure new fighters through various channels so that hopefully the air superiority over the Taiwan Straits would be balanced, but we were frustrated repeatedly due to the influence of international politics. Take the F-16 as an example. We sought to acquire them through "military sales" for the past 12 years, but were turned down every time. Now that the situation has changed, the former president of the United States, Mr. Bush promised on September 2, 1992 to sell us 150 "Phoenix Project'' fighters. We also have succeeded in procuring 60 "Flying Dragon Project'' fighters through another channel. These are critical procurements which have great significance on the security of our country. They also represent the accomplishment that MND has endeavored to achieve over the past decade. After cautious evaluation, it is concluded that these opportunities should be firmly secured, since these procurements are in the best interests of our country. Therefore, based on Clause 1, Article 75 of the Budget Law, the following requisition of special budgets for the procurement of high performance fighters is submitted: To procure 150 "Phoenix Project'' fighters and 60 ''Flying Dragon Project'' fighters.

The total cost required is 317,262 million NTD. This budget is proposed to come from two sources: (1) 16,552 million NTD be transferred from certain projects deleted from the -
budget in FY/1993, and (2) the remaining 300,710 million NTD to be programmed subsequently in special budgets spread over nine years from FY/1993 through FY/ 2001. (Table 3-5)

Revision of Defense Manpower Structure Reduction of Total Strength FY/1993 ·
l.

Authorized strength: 474,000 Maintained strength: 29,000 Total strength: 503,000 FY/1994 2. 

Authorized strength: 468,000 Maintained strength: 29,000 Total strength: 498,000 The reduction of the force structure between these two years is approx. 5,000. Beginning from FY/1994, the ''10-year Streamline Project'' will be implemented and the pace of reduction will be accelerated.

Notes:
authorized strength: number of personnel strength authorized on the table of organization.

maintained strength: number of personnel not included in the table of organization but are still

required, such as student, recruits, casualties, prisons, etc.

total strength: the sum of the above.

Raising the Ratio Between the Authorized Strength and the Actual Strength in Units Generally, the ratio between authorized strength and actual strength in units can be used as a standard to evaluate the combat capability of the unit. As for overall combat powers, the number of units that could participate in combat is not as important as the combat capability of these units. In recent years, the ratio between the authorized strength and actual strength in units of our armed forces appeared to be rather low owing to the shortage of legitimate conscripts to serve in the military. It is expected that this situation will remain unchanged in the foreseeable future. In order for the combat units to acquire adequate combat capability, steps will be taken to simplify and integrate those units with overlapping functions, and to dissolve those that are not directly involved in combat. Following the principle of gradually reducing total strength, the ratio between the authorized strength and the actual strength in units will be raised to 80% or above.

## Expanding The Employment Of Civilian And Female Work Force

in Military Services Professional male servicemen have been the chief actors in our armed forces for years. Combat units, of course, re-

quire strong and young members to carry out their missions, but other administrative and technical type work could logically be accomplished by civilians and female members. Consistent with the Force Streamline Project, and for the purpose of upgrading the quality and efficiency of manpower employment, the service of civilian and female workers in the military will be further expanded so that the sources of manpower in the military can be increased.

l . 

Civilian in military service: There are approx. 17,000 civilians (employers included) currently serving in the armed forces. This amounts to 3.53% of the total strength.

This percentage is lower than those in several other countries. We aim to review and revise our tables of organization to change some of the billets concerned with education, research and development, training, administration, technical specialties and warehousing into civilian billets, so that high quality civilian personnel can be attracted to contribute their services in the military. These changes could also provide opportunities for officers who are willing to transfer to civilian jobs in the military after they are discharged under the Streamline Project. Efforts will be made in MND to bring about these changes through the legalization of the procedures. Female Work Force: 554 female officers and 1,306 female 2.

NCOs have been enlisted and trained in the armed forces since FY/1992. Statistics of their assignments up to June 1993 are shown in Tab. 3-6. To further expand the employment of the female work force in the military, MND has discovered that more than 14,000 billets(3200+ for of-

ficers; 11,000+ for NCOs) are suitable for them. The armed forces are now going to improve the working environment to encourage more females to join the military
· service.

## Acquisition Of Officers Ii.

Except for the compulsory service members, officers of the armed forces are primarily students graduated from various military schools and academies. However, the quantity and quality of students enrolled in military schools and academies in recent years are well below what we hoped for due to the prosperity of the economy and increased opportunities available to high school students for higher education, thus making them unwilling to choose military service for career.

Also, the total number of high school students has decreased on account of the low rate of birth. Steps have been taken by MND to select college graduates who are qualified for conscription to serve as reserve officers to offset the shortage of company grade officers. Consideration is also being given to adapting the R.O.T.C. system which the United States has successfully practiced for years, to attract college students who are willing to accept the scholarships and military training provided by MND, in return for serving in the military after their graduation according to their wishes and specialties.

Those who choose a career in the military will be treated the same as other officers graduated from military schools.

It is believed that the creativity of officers could be stimulated and the ability and quality of officers could be improved when these measures are implemented.

## Iii. Refinement Of Nco System

NCOs are the backbone of basic units of the armed forces.

The training and combat performance of the troops are depen-

dent on the execution of duties by NCOs. Currently, most senior NCOs are approaching the verge of retirement, leaving a tremendous gap behind them. The ratio of officers to NCOs, and EM currently is 1:2.4:26. The proportion of NCOs is too small. In addition, the percentage of NCO reservists in service is much too high. Since the period of their service on active duty is very limited, it is difficult for them to keep the operation and maintenance of the ever-more-sophisticated weapons and equipment carried out satisfactorily. Consequently, improvement of the organizational structure and the quality of NCOs are all critical problems in the force structure objectives of the future.

The measures of reforming the NCO structure include:
1.

Development of an independent NCO structure:
To redefine the division of authority and responsibility between officers and NCOs, and to establish an NCO structure which complements that of the officers, so the career of NCOs could be developed alongside officers and the prestige of NCOs can be enhanced.

Adjustment of the NCO structure:
2.

Consistent with the force objective project, MND is going to revise the tables of organization to decrease the number of officers and increase the number of NCOs, bringing the ratio of officers to NCO and EM to 1:3:2, and to provide more employment opportunities for NCOs in their careers.

Improvement of education systems:
3.

It is proposed that high school or college graduation will be a qualification required for students to be enrolled in NCO schools. Plans are to establish channels for NCOs to receive higher education, and to encourage them to acquire university education in the country or abroad. An education background will be included in the requirements for their promotion and pay raise.

Improvement of treatment, allowance and welfare:
4.

The differences of allowance between different grades of NCOs will be widened, and service allowances will be increased. The highest salary and allowance an NCO could get will be raised to the level approximately equal to that of full colonels. Living conditions, vacations, and environment will be improved so that NCOs will be separated from EMs, and separate areas of activities will be provided to uphold NCO's prestige. Hopefully, these improvements will encourage NCOs to serve in the military as long as possible.

## Iv. Integration And Modification Of Officer And Nco Service Regulations

The "Service Regulations for Officers'' and the "Service Regulations for NCOs'' of the armed forces have been effective for more than 30 years since their promulgation in August 1959. They have never been revised except for minor adjustments on some articles concerning the limits of service terms in 1970 and 1974. But today, the situation has changed dramatically, and we deem it appropriate that the two regulations for officers and NCOs should be integrated. The legal

procedures of this integration are expected to be completed prior to 1994. Some major modifications are made as follows:
To revise the limits of service terms of general (and flag)
1.

officers:
To ensure the strength of the armed forces as well as the reserves potential, MND, in consideration of military requirement and personal potential development, will enact reasonable limit of term of service for both officers and NCOs upon the date of commissioning.

To reduce the minimum service terms on active duty for regular officers and NCOs:
The current limit of term of service for regular officers and NCOs is 10 years. MND have permitted regular officers to retire after they have completed service on active duty of 8 years in respect for personal willingness. Subject to the availability of personnel strength. According to the assessment of the current force structure of the armed forces as well as the limit of term of service for those students graduating from the four-year military schools in foreign counties, regular officers and NCOs are required to serve on active duty for at least 6 years and 4 years respectively. But the actual term they should serve will be stipulated in the directions for enlistment of students based on the duration of the basic education of the officers and NCOs.

To revise the regulations for female officers and NCOs 3.

as follows:
The minimum terms of service on active duty required for female officers and NCOs are 4 and 3 years respectively. The age limit is 45. In order to encourage the 2.

female work force to take part more actively in military service, and to provide them with opportunities equal to those for male members, the standards of service regulations for females will be revised accordingly.

4.

Revision of retirement and compensation system, and provision of vocational training prior to retirement:
Consistent with the newly promulgated retirement and compensation system of the civil functionary, and for the purposes of "reasonably changing the standards of allowances", "gradually raising the retirement and compensation allowances'' and "procuring funds for retirement and compensation'', the regulations concerned will be revised as follows:
To extend the limit of term of service for payment a.

from 30 years to 35 years.

b.

Under the old regulations, the "cardinal number" used for calculation of payment is the sum of base pay and "food allowance". It will be revised into ''double the base pay plus food allowance'' so that the total amount the retired members receive would be approximately the same as those on active duty.

c.

To revise the "cardinal number of payment" and its percentage reasonably:
Severance pay:
(1) 
The severance pay for a maximum of 30 years' service is 61 "cardinal number" according to the old regulation. It will be revised to 53 ''cardinal number'' for maximum term of service for 35 years.

(2) 
Retirement and compensation allowance:

The old regulations called for 75% to 90% of the monthly salary be paid for those who have completed 15 years of service on active duty as retirement and compensation allowance. This will be revised under the new regulations.

Retirees will get 2% of the ''cardinal number''
of his original salary for each year's active service he has completed. The maximum allowance is 70% of the ''cardinal number'' of his salary for 35 years' service.

Pension:
(3)
The amount of pension will be raised from 80%
of the monthly salary to 50% of the ''cardinal number''.

d.

Establishment of retirement and compensation foundation: From now on, every serviceman will have to contribute to a "retirement and compensation fund" correspondent to what the civil functionaries are paying. The amount of the fund is about 8%–12% of the ''cardinal number''. 35% of which will be paid by the individual serviceman and the remainder (65%)
will be included in the government budget. The serviceman will no longer contribute the fee upon the term of 35 years being completed.

Transitional clause:
Except for the servicemen who are already retired and receiving retirement and compensation allowance according to the old standards, those who retire after the promulgation of the new regulations will receive e.

their payment according to the total number of years on active duty they have served both before and after the new regulations become effective. The limit is still 35 years.

5.

The patronage for the survivors of the deceased servicemen:
The current pension paid in terms of the deceased's ranks and causes of death will be revised into the total number of years on active duty and causes of death and enlength the limit years of giving pension to the survivors in need of patronage.

## V. Provision Of Vocational Training Prior To Retirement

·
1. Col. and Lt. Col.

To assist Col. and Lt. Col. officers to develop the capabilities they need for a new vocation after retiring from the military service, MND has requested the Labor Union as well as the Commerce Union to render assistance in devising and making arrangement for vocational training prior to their retirement according to their own wishes and the requirements of the labor and commerce sectors. The duration of training is 6 months. The first 3 months will be devoted to lecture type instruction, and the last 3 months to practical work in factories. Vocational training programs completed since May 1992 are shown in Tab. 3–7.

Technical professionalism training for officers and enlisted men on active duty.

To adequately manage the manpower of the country and facilitate overall economic development and social security, MND has cooperated with the Labor Committee and has entrusted the Vocational Training Bureau to send officers and NCOs of voluntary service to various vocational training centers for technical and professional training, one year prior

to their retirement. For officers and enlisted men of compulsory service, recommendations are offerred for them to receive training or to be employed according to their wishes.

Over 2,000 officers and men have completed training in this category since June 1992. (up to September 1993)

![168_image_0.png](168_image_0.png) Pre-retiring vocational training for field grade officers 3.

Handling vocational recommendation and introduction to servicemen prior to retirement:
To enable about 500,000 retired compulsory servicemen each year to be employed timely and suitably, MND commit Da-Chung weekly to handle the affairs of vocational introduction to the servicemen prior to retirement, which will put the personal specialties and wishes of each individual on file in

computers for employers' selection in the hope that every serviceman can obtain his job upon the date of retirement. This activity has brought about desired effect since it was practiced on January 1, 1992.

## Upgrade Of Military Education Vi.

Education is the foundation of combat power. Only the quality of military education is upgraded can competent officers be cultivated to employ new weapons into service, thus far the establishment of NCO's system and the promotion of armed forces modernized. Recently. the military education has marched toward multi-development style; in the respect of

the qualification of teachers, MND has deeply evaluated the qualification of employed teachers, increased the number of professors and vice professors, encouraged officers to be engaged in advanced study to promote their professionalism, held series symposiums on defense administration and technology, enlarged the activities for academic communication with foreign countries, participated in the seminars held by worldwide-known tactical organizations, enhanced the theses to be assessed for promotion to elevate the qualification of the teachers; in the respect of soliciting new students, MND has lifted the grades of the entrance examination of military schools; revised with public registration for admission; gone back to the time-table and teaching contents of non-military universities; junior colleges and senior highschools and enhanced to create the academic atmosphere on campus; strictly examined and eliminated inferior students; reinforced the physical training of the students; to ensure the quality of the students; allowed the graduates to pursue advanced study in domestic or foreign universities and graduated schools. Contemporarily, the number of the recruits has been increased as well as the quality has been lifted. MND
will be devoted to the following aspects in the future:
1. 

the definition of education:
The parallel systems of non-military and military educations are normally in advanced countries. The military education is dominated by MND into a unique system due to its specific missions; however, there are by no means the fact that the non-military education diverging from military education and the teaching resources can not share with each other either. Take the U.S. and Germany

with the most perfect military education as an example, the education organizations will provide sufficient support for officers' pursuit of advanced study, budget of the military schools, academic communication between non-military schools and military schools, the confirmation of the professional subjects and the qualification o of teachers, which will not only make the academic communication between non-military and military schools go smoothly but benefit the promotion of overall standards and the understanding of national defense. However, ROC's educational system has never looked into the far-reaching influence of the diverging development between civilian and military educations. In fact, the service year limits of officers and NCOs have been shortened largely. The time that they feedback the society after retirement is far longer than that they are in the military service. Based upon the doctrine of "national defense is combined with people's livelihood'', the education of the military schools must connect with the tendency generating in the society. The servicemen cultivated in the military schools will contribute what they have learned to the military and the society as well.

Thus, the education of non-military and military should share the national education resources at the same time. 

the structure of education:
The education system for officers has been established.

2.

The advanced education has stepped from the pure military field into a more insightful landscape. MND is developing to set up a national tactical-level education organization to achieve the goal of the tactical research

combined with the education of non-military and military schools. The educational system of NCOs will pattern after that of officers which will design the curriculum for advanced study; enhance professional training; combine the national certifying system; adopt a reasonable promotion system. Additionally, MND will encourage military officers and NCOs to pursue further study in non-military schools, or in camps through the univeristy on the air. Then it can achieve a multi-training goal and benefit the students to program their career of the future. the content of the education:
Based upon the policies of going back to teaching timetable and contents of general universities, junior college and senior high schools, all the military schools will enhance the communication of instructing research with non-military schools. Every military school will set up an ''instructing inquiry committee'' which will invite experts to review the goal of education, initiate the designation of curriculum and assess the effectiveness of instruction. The basic military training will be carried out according to various subjects during winter, summer and post-graduation. The education of further learning will be focused on the professional instruction according to varied military branches. The latest technology will be introduced into the education of advanced studies. NCOs will obtain professionalism through practical exercise.

The education of advanced studies will enable NCOs with a commander or staff background as well as the capacity to conduct a joint operation, besides cultivating the cadres of NCO to be with insightful tactical capacity and a 3.

global perception is especially important.

## Execution

It is understood that the benefits of education will not be apparent immediately. To ensure that the education policies are carried out without variance or interruption despite changes of commanding officers, MND has considered employing education specialists to be deputies or officers in charge of education administration in the armed forces. To upgrade the quality of instructing, MND will demand the teachers in military to do academic research and pursue futher learning, and in order to elevate the standards of qualification of teachers, based upon the system of "speciality instructors'', those capable military instructors will no longer change his post of service with other servicemen by turns. MND will completely carry out the principle of ''selecting the excellent and eliminating the inferior'' and demand the students to be loyal to ROC on Taiwan, well-learned and strong. The efforts of investing educational hardware and software will go on, better educational conditions will be established to cultivate the just quantity of cadres with qualified quality.

## Vii. Execution The Furlough System

In addition of national holidays, voluntary officers and men are given other holidays. However, these other holidays are not given automatically because of the heavy responsibilities of the military force and relatively long distance between military camps and their homes. Therefore, military personnel do not enjoy normal family life as civilians do, which affects the willingness of those active officers and men to remain in the armed forces. Recognizing this situation, MND has taken steps to carry out the furlough system in order to raise morale. Concrete measures are as follows:
1. 

Routine Working Time In high military commands, schools, organizations, above fourth echelon (included) hospitals, factories, depots and other units that are not involved directly in combat or readiness tasks, only ODs and guards remain in the camps according to regulation; others go home after working eight hours a day.

Furlough in Troop Units 2.

In units below division level (included), those whose  
homes are not far away from their military bases will be allowed one or two nights each week to stay with their families at their homes unless they are ODs or assigned special missions. For those whose homes are far away from their military bases, they will be allowed to get proper time to go home on furlough.

In addition, individual career development and the location of their homes are being considered. In other words, they can be transferred to units closer to their homes with similar functions, so that they can perform their duties successfully without sacrificing their normal furlough. Such a measure will hopefully raise morale of volunteers and encourage them to serve in the armed forces for a longer time.

## I. Strategies For Research & Development Of National Defense  Technology

In modern warfare, technology is the key to the outcome of a war. Therefore, research & development of national defense technology has become an important matter in military build-up. It is particularly important for those nations that want to achieve an independent national defense policy to conduct research & development of selected technologies by devoting more materials and manpower.

Early in the 1960s, the Republic of China began to conduct research & development of national defense technology.

After the severence of Sino (ROC)-American diplomatic relations, it was increasingly difficult for ROC Government to purchase military weapons and equipment from the United States and other countries, and so it began to increase R&D
of defense technology. In 1984, the ''Defense Technology Development Program'' was approved; and in 1985, the ''Implementation Commission of R&D of Defense Technology''
was created to train scientists, formulate technological development plans and programs, initiate plans to employ all resources

of the nation, and be prepared to establish a defense technology information system. After going through a period of difficulty, review, and experience, the following strategies have been found by which ROC should develop its defense technology:
1. 

Defense technology should be established on the basis of civilian technology:
Defense technology isolated from civilian technology would not only increase national financial burden but also limit the scope of development. After all, national defense resources are limited, an isolated and ambitious plan of research, development, and production of military items would hinder all-out economic development of the nation.

Esprit de-corps should be developed:
2.

Research, development, and production of any weapon system requires a long time and the coordinated effort of the nation. In order to achieve this mission satisfactorily, esprit de-corps and close coordination among people of units concerned are a necessity.

3.

Key technologies should be selected:
Since ROC national power is limited and technical level is low, and since purchase of military items from foreign countries can satisfy our defense needs, it is a waste to invest all resources in developing and producing military items. Therefore , R&D
strategy of defense technology must be selective in nature. Generally speaking, the ROC Government should focus its efforts to develop selected military

technologies based on its own technical level, war preparation requirement, and condition of buying foreign weapons.

II.

Future Development Direction of the Chungshan Science and Technology Institute and Reorganization of the Aviation Development Center 1.

Future development direction of the Chungshan Science and Technology Institute:
The Chungshan Science and Technology Institute should be commended for its distinguished contributions to research and development of an independent national defense technology. However, since the ROC
defense environment has changed, ROC's purchase of weapons from foreign countries is easier than before and the defense budget is reduced, the original plan for independent production of weapons must be stopped or reduced.

Since development of defense technology is the foundation of an independent national defense for ROC, it cannot be stopped completely. Therefore, in order to prepare for the future, the Chungshan Science and Technology Institute will be responsible for developing key technologies essential to manufacturing defense weapons such as war heads, missile i propulsion systems, anti-submarine techniques, electronic warfare, missile testing, etc., while R&D of other technologies will be included in the overall national technology policy to be developed by academic and industrial circles. Near-term plans call for establishment of the ''Non-Profit Cycle Foundation''
and development of dual technique markets for both military and the civilian use. Furthermore, certain i

2.

special companies will be established to transfer to government-owned enterprises and civilian circles those techniques that manufacture defense products which might be used by civilians. By so doing, civilian industrial capabilities will be boosted. The long-term concept emphasizes the reorganization of the Chungshan Science and Technology Institute to increase operating flexibility. The objective is to coordinate with the development requirement of the government and civilian units, to gradually open up technologies to civilian use, and to establish satellite factories for the defense industry.

Reorganization of the Aviation Development Center:
After careful and detailed evaluation, a conclusion was reached to reorganize the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology in near term, so that all resources including manpower could be effectively used immediately after completion of quantity production of the ''Ching-kuo'' IDF aircraft. The reorganization plan first calls for establishment of state-run units under the Ministry of National Defense, and then reverting these units to private operation. After reorganization, the "Aviation Development Center'', now the single body for manufacturing military aircraft, would become a dual-purpose industrial body for producing aircraft and other related items for both military and civilian use. By so doing, the following results are expected:
On national defense: Independent operation a.

can reduce the budget

b.

burden and promote military aircraft manufacturing capability and competitive capability.

Economically: Through cooperative programs between military and civilian circles, domestic as well as foreign orders can be accepted, satellite factories of the aerospace industrial center can be established, and the industrial level can be elevated.

Internationally: Through cooperation between ROC aerospace industry and foreign aerospace industry, new techniques can be introduced, national prestige can be enhanced, and the international position of the ROC can be maintained.

## 1993–94 National Defense Report Policy Of Procurement: 2.

In oder to patronize domestic industry, the procurements are conducted domestically according the following regulations:
a.

Those military supplies items that have already been able to be manufactured domestically should not be purchased from foreign countries, except some specific factors.

Although the required items can not be
(2)
manufactured domestically, yet should adopt those domestic items of similar specifications as substitutes as possibly can. For those supplies required by the Armed
(3)
Forces yet not produced in domestic, the procurement can be done by the domestic capable manufacturers through the procedure of a test-manufacture or an experimental order.

To meet the requirement of provision, the military supplies must purchase foreignally. Yet the selected purchasing regions should meet the ROC's foreign trade policies, and must be qualified for the followig principles:
b.

Those military supplies are exactly not yet manufactured domestically, the substitutes of the similiar specifications are not available either. An test-manufacture/order can not timingly meet the requirement.

Although the required supplies are manufac-
(1)
(1)
(2) 
tured domestically, the quality can not meet or will affect security, or in the case the prices are higher 10% than those of the imported cost.

In the cases of emergency or the shortage occurring expectedly, the supplies must be purchased from foreign countries. Yet the budget of procurement can not exceed 10,000,000 NT dollars and the domestic import company must have the goods on hand or can provide the goods within two months after a contract signed. Additionally, the quality of the goods must be reliable and its prices should be reasonable.

A procurement must follow the principle of purchasing directly from the original factories or manufacturers. Yet to adapt to practical requirement, a procurement can be conducted through the sub-contract company/consignee/agent of the original factories or maunfacturers. To cope with the manufacturing seasons and to c.

d.

control the business information, the procurement of military supplies must be offered sufficient time to conduct for smoothly achieving a procurement. Thus, the advanced plans must be conducted to avoid the case of time-pressing procurement as well as out of balance between the supply and the demand.

The military procurement should meet the goals of the requirement of provision and timely acquirement, in addition, the following factors must e.

f.

be taken into consideration:
(1)
(2)
Quality of the military supplies is the decisive factor. The validity and its prices can not be considered unless the quality of the supplies is qualified.

Validity and price are the relative factors of the procurement of military supplies.

Which one is prior to the other depends on the characteristics of the procurement and the requirement of provision.

## 3. Delegation Of Authority:

a.

foreign procurement:
Foreign procurements over one million U.S.

dollars (inclusive) will be conducted and regulated by Tri-services General Headquarter Commands and the Chungshan Science and Technology Institute; while procurements below one million U.S. dollars (inclusive) and military sale affairs will report to MND for approval, then conducted by procurement organizations (the Material Directorate, CSF and the Defense Procurement and Service Mission, CCNAA). Some cases with special situations will be authorized to be conducted respectively by requiring organizations.

· a.

the parallelity of of centralization and authorization:
The procurements of military supplies and equipment will be mainly conducted through centralization.

b.

the process of three steps:
This process means "requisition of purchase, bidding and contracting, and delivery and acceptance'' three steps. These three steps will, on one hand, progress separately and restrain one another; on the other, coordinate and cooperate one another. (Chart 3-7)
c.

multiple supervision system:
Over certain amount of procurement will be supervised by the Audit Department of the Executive Yuan as well as control, auditing, adminstrative departments and the top supervision organization--the Deputy Chief of the General Staff for Logistics of MND.

## 5. The Arrangements Of Business Information: 6. Status Quo Of Purchase:

the integration of business information:
Since 1 July, 1993 the Material Directorate, CSF,
continuously connected with domestic and foreign large data bases. Currently it can accept committed inquiry from various units of MND. .

the recommendation by manufacturers or the exhibition of military supplies:
The Combined Service Command establishes the industrial service division which provids information service for foreign manufacturers, or arranges the affairs for the exhibition of military supplies on behalf of the foreign manufacturers.

Through this way, CSF can acquire exact business information; eliminate the involvement of agent; then achieve the goal of directly purchase from the original manufacturers.

a. b.

From FY/1991 to 1993, a total of 69,000 purchase cases have been done by the ROC armed forces
(domestic purchase: 57,000 cases, foreign purchase: 11,000 cases, military sale:190 cases) with the total sum  of money  reaching  to  more  than NT$250,000,000,000. The analyses of procurement status are introduced as Charts 3-8 and 3-9.

# Management Of Logistics

## Adjustment Of Logistics Structure I.

Logistic support guarantees sustained combat power; without logistics, war cannot be fought continuously. The more modern warfare is, the more important logistics becomes. In the past, the strategic concept of the ROC armed forces was ''integration of offensive and defensive operations'', and logistics structure was based on this concept; it required more manpower and money to establish exterior bases for launching offensive operations. Now, the strategic concept has been changed to "defensive posture", and a policy of refining forces (with better quality but less quantity) is adopted.

Under such a situation, adjustment of the logistics structure has been made as listed below:
The pattern of logistics support becomes regional:
1.

In the past, a logistics operation support unit was established in combat field forces at each level, so that requirements of offensive operations could be met. Now, as the strategic concept has changed to purely defensive operations, efficiency is the main factor to be considered. In the future, logistics units will only be maintained in tactical combat forces,

## 171 172 1993-94 National Defense Report

while each combat zone will be considered as one logistics support area. By so doing, various support units in one area will be integrated to be controlled by commander of the combat zone in order to shorten the process and increase support efficiency.

2.

:
The support structure becomes functional:
Logistics support can be categorized into supply and maintenance. In the past, various arms of the Army had their own supply and maintenance units, making organizations very big, overlapping functions and wasting resources. Now, logistics support is classified into two main systems: supply and maintenance, without considering any arms. In other words, the problems of supply and material, regardless of any equipment, will be handled by the supply system while problems of repair & maintenance will be disposed of by the maintenance system.

Logistics support capacity of new weapon systems is being planned:
Weapons and equipment of the ROC armed forces 3.

usually come from foreign military assistance and purchase, and requisition of spare parts and accessories is done only by referring to the need calculated by computers with no overall logistics support planning. In conducting R&D of weapon systems, units only considered how to make a breakthrough on the technical level and ignored planning of overall logistics support by using information. As soon as a weapon system becomes operational, we immediately feel the deficiency of providing effective support to
... .

these weapons. In order to correct such a defect and coordinate with the manufacture of the second generation weapons, we are now planning overall logistics support so as to realize the objective of ''completing the establishment of logistics support capability on the day a particular weapon system becomes operational.''
The above mentioned adjustment of logistics structure will be carried out in two phases. The first phase was completed at the end of June, 1993. After going through evaluation, review, and correction by experimental units, the second phase will begin based on the experiences and models derived from the experiments. It is expected the whole work of adjustment will be completed in two and one half years.

## Refinement Of Supply And Maintenance Systems Ii.

In recent years, large quantity of modern weapons have been developed and requirements for supply and maintenance are increasing day by day. In order to effectively employ limited national defense resources to provide timely logistics support to proper places and with proper quality and quantity, MND is adopting the following measures with regard to the supply and maintenance systems:
l.

Reflect requirements precisely to improve timeliness of availability:
Supply and repair maintenance information transmission system will be established by connecting the 3rd and the 5th echelons of supply and maintenance units to the Logistics Control Center directly, so that

precise requirements of various units can be reflected.

Furthermore, due-outs which are overdue over one year will be examined, void requisition vouchers will be eliminated, support and operational capacity will be defined, so that turnover quantity and stock level will be adjusted. In addition, stock purchase procedure will be improved by "signing a contract only once, spreading out companies, and delivering stocks according to different areas," so that timely delivery can be realized.

.

2.

Improve storage operation and eliminate useless equipment:
Labels will be used in packing military items to ensure that accounts comply with the number of items when the automatic storage process is adopted. In addition, operational storage facilities will be added. Useless equipment will be eliminated quickly(in FY/93, a total of 78,717 pieces of equipment were eliminated including 15 LCMs, 20 LCVPs, 3,670 various types of wheeled-vehicles, 2 M42 artillery carriages, 3 M41 artillery carriages, and 46 kinds of both light and heavy arms), so as to effectively reduce the burden on storage space and manpower.

Improve staple food storage and increase subsidy of 3.

food allowance:
For the purpose of coordinating with the change of operation pattern and requirement of reduction of manpower, the stock levels of provisions and fodder will be adjusted and processing plants of rice for the armed forces will be decreased. An agreement

will be signed with the Taiwan Provincial Food Bureau to ensure the supply of food in wartime will be provided directly by the Bureau. Starting from FY/94, food allowance will be increased for officers and men.

Improve management of ammunitions, spare parts, and accessories:
4.

In accordance with the adjustment of armed forces structure and modernization of weapons, stock levels of ammunition will be modified. Overall supply plans will be formulated based on mission characteristics, longevity of storage of ammunition, and financial condition. Ammunition will be either purchased from foreign countries or manufactured by CSF domestically. In order to remedy the deficiency of too long a time required to supply spare parts and accessories, various units concerned are allowed to present their cases of requisition for the next year in April the previous year, so that spare parts and accessories can be supplied in a timely manner.

## Iii. Establishment Of An Overall Medical Care Concept And The National Defense Medical Center

For the purpose of establishing an overall medical care concept and developing integrated medical care facilities, a regional united medical care responsibility system centered around general hospitals will be established. Furthermore, in order to comply with the strategic concept of "defensive defense'' and the 10-year reduction plan of the armed forces, medical administration units, military hospitals, and medical

1993–94  National  Defense  Report care support units of various services will be integrated into the Medical Bureau of the MND, and ineffective medical care units will be deactivated (Table 3-9).

Table 3-9 Organization Chart of Future Military Medical Care

![203_image_0.png](203_image_0.png)

-
In addition, based on the concept that prevention is more important than care, all medical care units are increasing examination of recruits for AIDS. On the average, a total of 140,000 persons are examined each year. Furthermore, recruits are vaccinated with 150,000 agents of German measles vaccine provided by the National Health Administration. Effectiveness is evident because the number of those who suffer from the German measles has been reduced to 191 persons in 1993 (January-June) from 2,869 persons in 1991 (Table 3-10).

.. 

In addition, a large-scale National Defense Medical Center is being constructed according to plans. Occupying an area of nearly 50 hectares and costing 13.5 billion NT dollars, this new center, once completed, will have the high-level educational capacity needed 10 years later by the current National Defense Medical Center; all medical care capacity required by the Aerospace Medical Center, Sea-bed Medical Center, and Radiation Damage Prevention Center are operated by the Armed Forces General Hospital; and various recreational facilities. Construction of this center will be completed in June, 1998, which will have the following additional benefits:
l.

Training outstanding medical personnel:
Outstanding medical personnel (dentists, doctors, pharmacists, public sanitation personnel, aerospace medical personnel, and sea-bed medical personnel)
will be trained.

Raising medical care quality:
2.

With new buildings and its equipment, research will be carried out extensively; service capacity will be increased; and quality of medical care will be raised.

Thus far, the National Defense Medical Center will be qualified to be a modern national defense medical center.

Reinforcing peace and war time military medical care:
To reduce the diseases and harm generated through the specific surroundings of the military and the war, an Aerospace Medical Center and a Sea-bed Medical Center will be built in the second phase of construction, which will raise quality of aerospace medical care as well as diving medical care. This, in turn, 3.

will promote flying safety and diving safety. Furthermore, a "Nuclear Damage Treatment Center" will be established in the newly-constructed National Defense Medical Center'' in cooperation with the Taiwan Power Company so as to meet the medical care requirements both in peace and war time. Enlarging research & development:
Being restrained by the insufficient medical equipment, the current development of military medical personnel targets at basic medicine and clinical research. The new center, once completed, with excellent equipment and facilities will intensify research on military medicine, aerospace, sea-bed medicine and enlarge the research on basic medicine, clinical medicine to cope with the requirement of military buildup and combat readiness as well as to develop the characteristics of military medical personnel.

Supporting training of military medical personnel: Once completed, the new center, with the improvement of its medical facilities and equipment, can largely promote the quality and capacity for advanced studies of doctors, masters, specialist, resident doctor and annual continuous education. In addition, the new center can reinforce the medical service for the servicemen through providing medical technology support.

## Iv. Improvement Of Living Condition

Jobs performed by soldiers are quite different from those performed by civilians. No profession can compare with the military on the limitation of freedom, devotion to duty and hardship. Based on the recognition that improving the living conditions of the officers and men contributes directly to raising morale and increasing invisible strength, MND is taking the following actions:
Increase allowance for specialty and special regions:
1.

Military personnel are often exposed to bad weather conditions and environment, and they often face dangerous challenges. Besides, they are often sent to remote places where they live a very hard life

![207_image_0.png](207_image_0.png)

without enjoying normal family life and entertainment. Such hardship they suffer should be compensated reasonably. Efforts have been made in this respect, but no logical level has been reached so far. In the future, MND will do its utmost to appropriate more fund under reduced budgetary condition, which will be used to increase allowances.

Improve living condition and provide recreational facilities:
Recently, the living standards of the general public have been elevated in a large scale due to the progress of social development. To avoid the quality of life and the standards of recreation disconnecting with the society and generating the sense of alienation, and to improve the welfares for the servicemen, MND has been actively improving the living conditions, recreation and exercise facilities of the servicemen. Contemparily, MND selects ten camps from the tri-services on an experimental basis to carry out the improvement of about 1.3 billions NT dollars spending. The improved facilities have been accomplished continually from September, 1992 and now is under use on a trial basis. Once the effect is assessed, MND will promulgate guidelines, allocate budget to carry out the improvement year by year.

Additionally, to coordinate with the system of NCOs,and to stimulate the morale and the image of the NOCs, MND has actively established local recreation centers exclusively for the NCOs in Taipei, Taichung, Kaohsiung, E-Luan-Bi, Penghu areas 2.

which will advance NOCs' daily life and training surroundings.

## Renovation Of Military Camps V.

In the beginning, military camps lacked long-term planning due to national strategy and financial limitations. In the past four decades, living conditions of the people have gradually improved, and military camps now look simple and shabby. In the past, various services have tried to appropriate more funds to renovate military camps and bases. Currently the military camps that have been renovated are about 79%
of the all military camps required. (Table 3–11〜14)
At present, tremendous expenses are needed to develop second-generation weapons. However, MND tries to use funds to renovate military camps that need improvement, most despite budgetary restraints. (Table 3-15) The principle of renovation is as follows:
In coordination with ''the Goal of the Simplification of Armed Force" and "Refinement of the Logistics System", MND will make up fixed combat and service support troops in every camps which will enable the positions of camps to connect with tactical requirements. Additionally, to promote the quality of life in camps, facilities recreation, physical exercise, dormitories for official duties will be taken into designation at the same time.

## Vi. Reconstruction Of Old Dependent Housing

Military dependent houses are old and shabby, so the living environment is bad. After going through checks and examinations, MND finds that a total of 803 old military dependent villages need to be dismantled and reconstructed.

In 1980, MND formulated the "Guideline for Reconstruction of Military Dependent Villages During Experimental Period''
which guides reconstruction in the following ways:
After the approval of the Executive Yuan, MND pro1.

vides land occupied by dependent villages and owned by the government to construct apartment housing in cooperation with local governments. Houses, aftercompletion, are evenly divided between MND and local governments. Now, a total of 89 villages have been co-constructed with MND getting 18,441 houses. Based on the willingness of dependents themselves, MND entrusts the Military Dependent Housing Public Cooperative with the construction of houses using advances from the loan foundation. Reconstructed houses will house the original military dependents, and the rest will be allocated to those military personnel who do not own a house. So far a total of 27 villages with 4,698 houses have been reconstructed.

The Chinese Women Association selects low-priced land occupied by military dependent villages and owned by the government, or unused military camps, on which to construct official residences. Houses thus built are donated to MND free to house the original dependents, and the rest are used as official 4. 5.

:
residences. A total of 14 villages with 2,022 houses have been built so far.

In cases where land is occupied by military dependents but not owned by the government, MND will ask the owners of the land to agree to co-construct houses to be allocated to the original dependents. A total of 6 villages with 248 houses have been reconstructed. Currently, a total number of 5,192 households, 99 villages were torn town and changed the residence because the whole villages were purchased for reconstruction or coordinated with the local governments for constructing public facilities.

Other small military dependent villages located in 6.

remote areas that can not be reconstructed by ways mentioned above will be dismantled, and two-story reinforced concrete houses will be rebuilt on the spot.

Each family will be subsidized by the government with the maximum of NT$400,000, the rest will be provided by the dependents themselves. A total of 21 villages with 1,739 houses have been rebuilt. Those villages whose houses are not proper to be rebuilt this way will be repaired, and each family will be subsidized by the government with the maximum of NT$ 60,000. A total of 132 villages of 15,550 houses have been repaired.

At present, there are 20 villages with 8,718 houses being reconstructed into multi-storyed apartments; 9 villages with 838 houses being reconstructed into two-story reinforced concrete houses; and 14 villages with 984 houses being repaired.

In addition, construction of new dependent houses (9,010

houses scattered in 35 places) has been approved by the Executive Yuan (the cabinet) and will begin soon.

The task of pushing and coordinating the reconstruction of dependent houses is complicated and difficult to deal with due to too many factors involved in. MND has tried its best to resolve the problem and carry out the mission. Now, the established ''Research Group for Dealing with the Real Estate Issue of the Reconstruction of Military Dependent Houses''
is working out resolutions to the current problem; developing rules for carrying on the duty. Meanwhile, to make the duty carried out smoothly, MND is in need of an overall support and coordination from every organization of the government as well as from the people's representative bodies.

# Alerting Surveillance And Early Warning

## The Alerting Surveillance To Territorial Air And Waters I.

Taiwan is surrounded by seas and located at a pivotal position of the Asia-Pacific region, which has a heavy traffic in the air and sea,therefore the prior task is to maintain effective surveillance of its peripheral territorial air and water to prevent unauthorized entry. The ROC Armed Forces have long been performing this mission through the Air Operation Center (AOC), intelligence collection units at various levels, and equipment such as electronic interception gear, radar station, patrol aircraft and ships. Recent upgrading of equipment has made those capabilities much more effective. (Table 4-1)

## Early Warning Of Mainland China'S Troop Movements Ii.

Taiwan is separated from the Chinese mainland by the Taiwan Strait, which is only about 72 nautical miles at the narrowest distance, from Hsin-chu to Ping Tang, and 140 nautical miles at their widest. It takes only 5 to 10 minutes for the enemy's combat aircraft, and about 2 to 4 hours for their fast combat ships to approach us from the other side

In addition, fishing boats from the mainland have recently been concentrating in Taiwan waters. Because their intentions are unknown, our surveillance efforts are getting under stress. Therefore, it is necessary to set up an earlywarning system to prevent a surprise attack and allow the time for reaction. Besides using electronic interception, radar surveillance, and air/sea patrolling, the ROC Armed Forces have taken other measures, such as AWACS and satellite photo interpretation, to improve our early-warning capability. In addition, the new Coast Guard Force has integrated inshore surveillance/patrol capability to reinforce surveillance efforts and improve the capability of early waring. In response to recent changes in the PRC's political and economic situation, and recent military deployments, measures have been taken to open up more high-level channels of intelligence collection to assure a high degree of security.

# Ground Forces

The ground forces mainly consists of the Army and Armed Forces Police. As the decisive force for ground operations, Army carries weight because any operation must be settled through the decisive period of ground combat, even under the defensive combat of island protection or once the navy and air force are dismissed in setback situation. The Armed Forces Police, on one hand, are primarily responsible for military police affairs; on the other hand, are responsible for defending essential positions as well as significant depots; meanwhile, they are also commissioned with the task of supporting ground combat.

## Ii. Current  Missions

The current missions of the ground forces are primarily focused on defending the territory and ensuring the security of ROC on Taiwan. In peace time, the ground forces, allocated in every siginificant position around Taiwan as well as in remote islands , are commissioned with the duties of alerting, training, battle field planning, coordinately protecting the bases of Navy and Air Force, civil defense as well as mountain and coastal defense; while in war time, based on guidance of being "mobile, speedy and decisive," the ground forces

will conduct joint attacks against anchoring areas, beachhead combat, counter-airborne and continuous counter-attack to destroy the invading enemy.

## Iii. Outlook

The Army will pursue the development of "mechanized armor'', ''air-land'' and ''automation,'' which include the enhancement of electronic warfare system; the connection with administrative information system to improve the performance of C4I capabilities; speeding up the development of light and medium tanks; establishing a "ground-air" rapid attack forces organized with armed helicopters and armored vehicles; upgrading the anti-air defense on the ground, anti-armored vehicles, and anti-nuclear, biology and chemical capabilities; change with new self-propelled artillery and ballistic missile to advance launch-control systems and enhance the capabilities of firepower support. With these efforts, the objective of building a troop capable of rapid response as an answer to a combat will be achieved.

![231_image_0.png](231_image_0.png)

An Exercise is performed by the Army.
# Navy

Because Taiwan is surrounded by seas, the ROC Navy must focus its attention on the effective control and surveilliance of its peripheral waters. The ROC Navy, hence, is expected to develop its surface warfare capability by taking part in joint operations with the Army and Air Force.

## I. Strength Status

Total Force: 68,000 troops (including 30,000 marines).

## Organization

Under the unified direction of the Navy GHQ, naval forces are divided into two parts, i.e., operational forces and ground organs. The operational forces consists of:
1.

Destroyers 2 destroyer fleets 1 frigate fleet Amphibious forces 2.

## Ii. Current Missions

The current missions of the ROC Navy are to ensure the freedom of navigation and safety in the Taiwan sea. If invasion occurs, the navy would, under air force support, employ surface vessels, submarines and mines to carry out their missions of anti-blockade and navigation protection. When necessary, the navy may have to take such offensive actions as intercepting enemy ships and attacking / destroying the enemy's harbor facilities. In peace time, the Navy would also detach its forces to provide shelter for fishing boats and conduct patrols.

## Iii. Outlook

For future development, the ROC Navy will continue to build new-type missile frigates, missile escort destroyers, offshore patrol ships, mine sweepers and large-scale missile speed boats to form a surface force with a capability of sea defense and mobile strikes. In addition, the Navy plans to purchase submarines and anti-submarine weapons to strengthen its three- dimensional capability of anti-submarine operations. Meanwhile, the Navy will gradually complete the deployment of shore-based missiles, accelerate the automation of C3I systems and strengthen Marine Corps' operational capabilities of air defense, anti-tank combat and mechanized operations.

# Air Force

Among the Armed Forces, Air Force is the operational arm with the greatest flexibility and quickest reaction. Without air supremacy, operations at sea and on land have no chance of winning a modern war. In view of Taiwan's geography, air defense is particularly critical for overall defense.

## Strength Status I.

Total strength: 68,000 (including flight and ground personnel).

## Organization

Under the direction of the Air Force GHQ, organization of the Air Force is divided into two systems—the operational system and logistic support system. The operational system contains:
1.

6 Tactical Combat Aircraft Wings 2.

1 Transport/antisubmarine Wing 3.

1 Tactical Control Wing 4.

1 Communication & ATC Wing 5.

1 Weather Wing 6.

5 Separate Teams

7.

1 Air-Defense Artillery Guards Command, which contains 4 commands a. b.

14 air-defense artillery batallions 11 guards batallions c.

## Current  Missions Ii.

The current missions of Air Force are to protect the security of air space as well as the integrity of sovereignty of Taiwan areas. In wartime, the Air Force will conduct a coordinated air-defense, utilizing combat aircraft, air-defense missiles and artillery to carry out air attacks and overlapping interception to annihilate enemy aircraft one by one. If necessary, troops will be detached to conduct coordinated counterstrike operations against selected enemy in the front line or tactical air control facilities most detrimental to us.

## Iii. Outlook

For future development, the ROC Air Force will vigorously continue to procure high performance combat aircraft, with 430 combat aircraft as its structure goal. It will also support the development of precise air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles to strengthen its capability for intercept and attack.

In order to establish a powerful and effective air-defense network, the overall automation of operational control will be completed and combine with high-quality reconnaissance aircraft, early warning aircraft and ground air-defense weapon systems. Meanwhile, the qualities of existing anti-submarine Status of Defense and Combat Readiness  209 aircraft and the operational capabilities of air mining and air movement will also be improved.

# Coast Guard Forces

In view of the fact that the 1,400 kilometer long coastline of Taiwan proper and the Pescadores, with a slight disparity among coastal terrains, can be a hotbed for smuggling, intrusion and infiltration which adversely affects social stability, economic prosperity and even endangers this country's security. MND thus assigned and activated guard forces on August 1, 1992 to ensure coastal security.

## I. Strength Status

Total Force: 26,000-odd troops.

## Organization

To meet the requirements of mission as well as organization of Armed Forces, and to adjust overall program, the
''Organization Law of the General Staff', a transitional organization-the Coast Guard Command-was established and subjected to the Armed Forces Reserve Command under the prerequisite of non-amendment of laws and based upon the sixth clause ...... The Coast Guard Command was activated as a responsible agency to command coast guard forces,

main forces of which are as follows:
:1.

8 Coast Patrol Commands 25 Coast Patrol Groups 2. 

## Current  Missions Ii.

For the purpose of securing and protecting the coastline from intrusion and smuggling, the Coast Guard Command is tasked by the orders of the Executive Yuan to coordinate and integrate the related units in the execution of coastal patrol and defense. (Table 4-2)
Through air patrol, inshore patrol, coastal patrol, harbor inspection and inland inspection, the execution of this mission has produced noted success. The results of smuggling and illegal intrusion interdiction since the establsihement of Coast Guard Command show as (Table 4-3).

The tasks of coastal patrol range in a broad sense. In order to assure the results, the first priority is to enact statutory rules and integrate responsibilities. The next step is to procure all types of detecting and patrol vessels, eliminate aging vessels and change with renewal ones, and establish an integral coastal surveillance system to make C3I fast and effective; to encourage coastal facilities to economize patrol forces and enhance intercept effects and to plan and construct air patrol forces to promote efficiency in surveillance and information collection.

# Reserves   Mobilization

## I. Reservist Status

Reservists play an essential role in the country's general combat effectiveness. Giving consideration to both national defense and economic construction and development, this country has a set policy -- ''to economize the number of regular forces and to enlarge that of reservists'', with the expectation to achieve the goal of "less army to maintain in peacetime and more army to utilize in wartime."
At present, the registered reservists of this country amount to about 3,750,000 persons and the quantity that can be mobilized is over ten percent of the general population. Among the reservists, the number of officers, non-commissioned officers and soldiers is some 300,000, 1,300,000 and 2,150,000 respectively. If classified by military service, the strength of Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force is some 3,010,000, 194,000, 233,000 and 332,000 respectively. Thirty-seven and half percent of the officers is less than thirty-five years of age which amounts to some 115,000 persons and 36.9 percent of the non-commissioned officers and soldiers are less than thirty years of age, which amount to 1,281,000 persons.

## 217 Group Arrangement And Training Of Reservists Ii. Group Arrangement

All the registered reservists are organized according to their residences, such as tsuen, li, lin, into ''Reserve Groups''
Every twenty reservists will be administered by reservist service stations of townships. In accordance with the "Annual Mobilization Program", the "Full Strength Mobilization'',
''Augmentation Mobilization'' and ''Combat Loss Replenishment Mobilization'' will be conducted with different mobilization signs by which the ''Armed Forces Mobilization Forces''
will be organized. In addition, all the registered reserve officers who are less than thirty-five years of age and reserve non-commissioned officers and soldiers who are less than thirty years of age must be manned into battalions.

## Training

1.

Educational Recall:
Educational recall aims at upgrading reservists' fighting skills and promoting their combat potential. To meet the
· needs of this country's economic development, educational recall was suspended from the year 1989 to 1992 t by MND and was resumed in 1993, during which 14,600 odd reservists were called up to receive five-day military specialty training. Furthermore, as of 1994, an additional unit recall will be enforced to conduct combination training.

## Muster Recall:

The main purpose of muster recall is to test the executive capabilities of mobilization program. It can be categorized into the following two categories:
Armed Forces Mobilization Forces:
a.

According to the annual mobilization program, all reservists, except for those who have already enlisted in educational recall, will be called up on the basis of mobilization signs to receive training in combat readiness missions at mobilization sites or nearby locations.

Regimental Reserve Forces:
b.

Apart from the full mobilization of reservists based on the annual mobilization program, reserve officers with less than thirty-five years of age and reserve non-commissioned officers and soldiers less than thirty years of age will be called up by Regimental Area Commands in each city and county according to their domiciliary registers, to receive training at appropriate locations. As to the results of reservist muster recall in 1992 and 1993, see Tables 4-3 and 4-4.

## Iii. Outlook

1.

Set up a specific organization to plan and execute all aspects of military mobilization:
Military manpower and military materiel are two of the essential elements in military mobilization; the former comprises unit organization, administration, training and utilization, while the latter, production, procurement, storage and replenishment. These have been placed under the administration of different staff units for such a long time that mobilization efficiency has deteriorated. Thus, in order to adapt to the "defensive posture" concept and execute the policy of down-sizing, an organization

responsible for special missions is proposed to set up to execute general matters of military mobilization in the hope of enhancing overall efficiency.

Improve training of reserve forces to enhance their combat capability:
A country's reservist combat capability is the root of its sustained combat potential. If insufficient, the policy of ''crack troops'' with ''less army to maintain in peace time and more army to utilize in war time'' will fail to materialize. So, in addition to regular recall training, hereafter, the recall of reserve organic forces and training of cadres and soliders will be given higher priority to fully utilize reserve combat potential.

Procure and store mobilization equipments to maximize effectiveness of reserve's combat capability: Because early warning is extremely brief in modern war, the preparedness of mobilization forces becomes critical.

To ensure that reserve forces can acquire necessary weapons and equipment at the earliest possible moment, these weapons and equipment must be pre-positioned at recall sites. Hereafter, MND will combine recall training during peace time with the procurement and storage of weapons and equipment for reserve units at predetermined operational areas to provide for immediate combat readiness in war time and optimize reserve's combat capability.

Shape the concensus of mobilization concept among the 3.

general public:
The importance of mobilization links with the livelihood of all people, influences national security, especially under 4.

2.

the policy of down-sizing in peace time. Therefore, under current system of the overall mobilization, how to advocate the mobilization concensus of "protecting our national security is everbody's obligation'' among the general public through the organization responsible for overall mobilization and through the comprehensive employment of education, advertisement and program will be the current and future focus.

## I. Resolution Of Land Disputes

1. 2.

The causes for land disputes between the military and the civilian population are complicated. For the best interests of both sides, various measures have been adopted by MND to speedup the solution of this problem.

Real properties for school-use under the urban revitalization plan but now utilized by the military totaled 83 hectares, in which 69% is military accountable. To promote educational development, MND is doing its best to serve this prupose.

## Ii. Facilitation Of Environmental Protection

To keep ahead with environmental policies announced by the government, MND is aggressively implementing environmental efforts based on the "Armed Forces Environment Program Initiative".

## Iii. Coordination Between The Military And Society

1.

MND values the coordination with the legislative branch, and fully communicates with legislators to drum up support and reach consensus.

2. 

For carrying out the spirit of the law and protecting people's rights, MND accepts appeals from the people and establishes legal procedure for national compensation.

In keeping with local economic development, MND has been lenient toward easing military control and the restricted areas.

3.

4.

MND values military civil actions such as disaster relief, search & rescue, harvesting assistance, free medical service, enlisted personnel service and military engineering support.

5.

MND is going to revise the Principles of Communication Frequency Administration for releasing frequencies to civil use.

6.

7 In association with important holidays and festivals, MND
holds force demonstrations, joint exercises and facilities open to the public to facilitate understanding between the military and the general public.

Modern national defense is built on the basis of consensus between the military and the public. MND continues stressing communication to promote mutual understanding.

# Resolution Of Land Disputes

Real estate controlled by the Armed Forces, to date, totals 37,444 hectares, of which 31,574 hectares are listed as post property (85%) and 5,870 hectares(15%) are registered as nonpost property. These post properties were left by the Japanese Army when Taiwan was recovered from Japanese occupation, or issued by the government and purchased by conscription.

Non-post properties are divided into 4 categories: public domain (2,984 hectares), real estate belonging to state enterprises (466 hectares), lands owned by civilian population (676 hectares), non-registered land and uncertain lands (1,744 hectares). Since legal procedures for these lands had not been completed during earlier times, disputes between the military and the parties concerned occur now and then. In order to settle these disputes in the best interests of both the military and civilian population, various measures have been aggressively adopted by MND to speedup the solution of this problem. (Remarks: uncertain lands refer to those lands that passed the deadline for registration, unclaimed lands or lands that have been claimed but the documents were not authenticated ,}-

## 227 1993–94 National Defense Report I. Public Domain Used By The Military

Public domain originally used by the military totaled 6,358 hectares. During the past 6 years(1987–1993), lands on which Shoushan Garrison Command, the 3rd Ammo Depot in Tainan, Lungteng Compound and Taipei Air Defense Artillery Regiment were situated, have been reissued for government use with the total area of 1,132 hectares. The training base in Hualien, the tank maneuvering area in Pingtung and the Hsing-ping facility in Kaoshiung, which totaled 2,207 hectares, are reissued for military use. 2,984 hectares of post facilities are to be processed. (Table 5-1) Real properties that justify military use would be reissued based on pertinent regulations governing state property and the Land Law imposed by the government.

## 228 Ii. Civilian Real Properties Used By The Military

Civilian real properties used by the military totaled 1,129 hectares. In the past 6 years (1987-1993), 199 hectares of land on which military installations were situated have turned over to the claimants. 254 hectares of real properties which included the training area in the Chinese Military Academy, Taichung and Hisnchu, were acquisitioned. (Table 5–2) All disputed real estates will be disposed of by MND through reissuing or acquisition. In some cases when the owners reluctantly offer their real estates for sale, the disputed lands will be settled through leasing or procurement.

## School-Accountable Real Estates Iii.

110 spots about 83.1 hectares of civilian schoolaccountable real estate are used by the military, of which 69% about 57.5 hectares are listed as post properties and 31% about 25.6 hectares are non-post real estates. (Table 5-3)The cause of this problem is the ignorance of the fact that urban revitalization plans affect post property to the degree that real estate belonging to the military was realigned without the military's knowledge. The issues now under dealing are 13.5 hectares of the real estates belonging to National Taiwan University; 1.6 hectares belonging to Diing-puu Elementary School in Taipei County; 2.5 hectares belonging to Dah-yarng Elementary School in Taichung; 1.2 hectares belonging to Guang-wuu Elementary School in Kaohsiung.

The increased attention on school-accountable real estates for military use prompted the partial return of these properties. Currently there still 38 hectares can not be removed because of necessary use, coordination among the Ministry of Education and the local governments will be actively made to facilitate the solution of this problem.

## Military-Accountable Real Estates Iv.

Real estates belonging to the military but used by individuals or units outside the military totaled 536 hectares.

In the past 6 years(1987-1993), 100-plus hectares real properties have been reclaimed. 436 hectares of real properties are to be settled. (Table 5-4) The cause of this problem is units that are charged with the responsibility of protecting and

maintaining property or keeping records for such property did not follow accountable procedures, causing many difficulties during the reclaiming process. MND will spare no effort to reclaim these properties and ensure the integrity of the post property.

## The Control Of Land Disputes V.

The disposal of land disputes is related to the maintance of national property and the protection of people's rights, and the mishandling of it would seriously affect the image of the government and the relations between the military and the general public. In the past 6 years (1987-1993), there were 421 cases of land disputes, among which 355 cases have been solved with the successful rate of 84%. To effectively control the cases, MND has incorporated the cases into computerized information system to monitor these cases and review it on a periodical basis. The principles for handling land disputes are as follows:
(a) Real properties leased, borrowed and occupied by the military: in conjunction with force deployment and drawdown of strength, real properties belonging to the civilian sector

will return to the owners as possible. Land that is vital to military mission is to acquire by programming budget through years. MND also initiates tax exempt to ease tax burden for landlords.

(b) Land that had been purchased or acquired but short of registration: real properties that expired the registration deadline for property right are processed with the cooperation of original owners who are encouraged by tax exempt and partial compensation.

(c) Restricted areas: with the minimun military security consideration, MND has been lenient toward real properties in the restricted areas to safeguard owners' right and compensate their losses by tax exempt.

(d) Since land disputes involve complicated legal procedure, each service headquarter handles real property case with care to ensure smooth relationships between the military and the civil population.

# Facilitation Of Environmental Protection

## Working Objectives And Main Efforts I.

The Ministry of National Defense (MND) is dedicated to fulfilling its environmental goals of complying with the government's environmental policy, improving the quality of life for servicemen, and creating an environment-clean image for the Armed Forces. Based on the "Armed Forces Environment Program Initiative'', the environmental quality efforts are implemented as mission-oriented and in 3 levels: guidance, planning and implementation.

## Phased Objectives

Short-term objective: integrated environmental quality activities and pollution prevention among the services are developed by well-qualified agencies or civilian contractors. Based on the planning goal, anti-pollution devices will be procured and installed as scheduled to ensure that the operation of these devices meets the environment standard under normal conditions.

Long-term objective: MND is developing progressive environmental education and training programs to support

ﺍﻟﻘﻀﻴﺒﻴﺔ establishing a highly qualified environmental work force. At the same time, it is essential to have the right environmental concept among service members. Additionally, MND provides national leadership in environmental protection in the hope that environment enhancement is everyone's concern.

## Environment Protection Focus

a.

The hazardous gas, noise, contaminated waters, waste materials generated by MND's industrial facilities are listed as the prior improving items.

Since the waste materials generated by hospitals are infectious, in conjunction with policies promulgated by the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA), military hospitals are cooperating with the National Health Administration to build incinerators for dealing with waste generated by the hospitals.

The disposal of general-purpose waste is put on a regular b.

basis. Principally, garbage incinerators are not intended to be built in military camps. The disposal of garbage should be local government's concern. In case local government is unwillig to take it up, MND will adopt the principle of committing civilian organizations to do the cleanup for saving government funds.

## Ii. Implementation 1. The Improvement Of Medical Waste:

In line with the regulation governing the procedure a.

for the disposal of waste water and products announced by the National Health Administration, all military hospitals have divided their wastes into 2 categories: general and infectious waste, combustible and non-combustible.

To settle for the pollution generated by military hospitals:
b.

19 waste water processing plants were set up with the fund of $200 million NT. These processing plants are subject to spot check by environmental agencies to ensure water treatment to meet the requirement imposed by the EPA.

c.

To ensure water quality to meet requirement, waste water generated in the hospitals is processed according to pertinent regulations. Specialists are charged with the task of operation and maintenance of water processing plants to ensure safety. Water quality is sampled and checked on a regular basis. Radioactive wasted water are recycled by the suppliers and radioactive isotopes are emitted through decaying or the absorbing. Highly contaminated water is preprocessed and then co-processed with the general waste water plants.

## 2. Anti-Pollution In Military Industrial Facilities:

a.

24 facilities--Army Automotive Command, Tank Development Center and so forth--are funded with NT$410 million to install waste water processing plants. To ensure the purification of waste water and

the noise level generated in the facilities not exceeding minimum requirement, integrated planning for antipollution is undertaken by environmental consultants.

b.

:
Military factories and depots under the three services are in the nature of reparation & maintenance and thus are less polluted. Nevertheless, to raise the quality of working environment and in keeping with environmental policy, these depots invite specialized environmental consultants to plan the over-all antipollution efforts in the hope that contaminated water or gases are not pollutant, and the noises generated in the working places do not exceed standard imposed by the authority.

All manufacture and maintenance depots carry out c.

the inspection of contaminated water according to the regulations imposed by MND. Quarterly inspection by survey teams authorized by EPA is also initiated to ensure the emission standard to meet EPA's requirements.

## 3. Disposal Of Contaminated Waters In Camps:

Installations near the reservoirs are put on the priority list for setting up sewage disposal plants.

To reduce pollution caused by kitchen service, 591 oil-decomposition grooves are installed in most camps with the budget of $NT39 million.

Camps near civilian communities or installations
(3)

where sewage system is not available would have 13 sewage disposal devices.

(4)
Owing to the fact that sewage generated in the camps is the same of that in nearby communities, and to avoid investment duplication, sewage disposal is planned to interface with local sewage system. Additionally, MND is now considering the possibility of setting up small set of sewage disposal devices.

b.

Improvement of air-pollution in camps:
To reduce the level of air pollution in the camps, kitchens and bathrooms in various camps are installed with natural gas pipelines. 212 installations have been installed with the pipelines invested with the budget of $NT1.13 billion.

c.

Disposal of garbage in camps: Garbages generated in military camps are classified as combustible, non-combustible and recycled. Additionally, MND has stipulated that garbage in the camps must be disposed by the units concerned or be handled by local environmental protection agencies with funding provided by MND. Littering or buring of garbage which tends to cause pollution is strictly prohibited.

## 4. Preventive Measures For Noise-Pollution In The Air Bases:

Under the condition that flight missions and safety are not affected, during all landing and taking-off, military aircraft's flight angle and directions are directed by the

The 3rd level sewage processing plants installed in military camps.
control tower, and supersonic flying over cities and land surface are strictly prohibited to reduce the level of noise generated by aircraft. Additionally, in keeping with the establishment of the monitoring network for noise generated by flights in Taiwan area, military-civilian purpose airfields were installed with such devices to lower the noise level.

## 5. Anti-Pollution In Military Ports:

The environmental cleanup in the 1st and 3rd Naval Military District has been initiated in keeping with the project for anti-pollution in Keelung and Kaohsiung Har-

![271_image_0.png](271_image_0.png)

bor announced by EPA. The release of oil and ballast by military vessels is strictly prohibited. 4 combatant ships are equipped with anti-pollution devices such as sewage treatment device and water-oil separator system. Additionally, to strengthen anti-oil pollution capability, $19.62 million NT is funded to purchase oil spillover retrieving devices, which effectively enhance the capability in oil spillover contingency.

## 6. The Preventive Measures For Smoke Emission Generated By Military Vehicles:

The current 21/2 ton heavy trucks (M35A2) in the inventory of the armed forces tend to emit black smoke due to long years of usage. A program to improve their engine combustion was initiated in 1992. The 1,350 improved heavy trucks were upgraded significantly in horsepower, oil consumption and emission. Beginning in July 1989, civilian-type cars in the inventory of the armed forces were required to fill their tanks with unleaded gas. Newlypurchased automobiles must meet the emission standards to eliminate air pollution. MND has approved the purchase of 4,616 11/4 ton Humvee trucks which meet U.S.

exhaust requirements. To prevent black smoke generated by military vehicles, besides preventive maintenance, roadside spot inspections are carried out by military police and local environmental protection agencies.

## 242 Other Conjunctive Measures Iii.

Since the first environmental symposium was held in March 1989, MND has been sponsoring environment guidance meetings on a yearly basis to coordinate and supervise environmental quality activities implemented by the services. A yearly staff visit is held to appreciate the allocation of environmental funding, investment and operation of anti-pollution equipment.

a.

The allocation of funding for environmental efforts was programmed by MND before fiscal year 1993. Beginning in fiscal year 1994, the budget authority was transferred to the military services and incorporated in the services' five-year program. By FY/1993, the total fund for the environmental program was $3.4 billion NT.

b.

Responding to "national cleaner week" activities sponsored by the EPA, the Armed Forces provide manpower to assist local governments in environmental cleaning, along with free medical service and media coverage. For instance, 149,000 troops and 3,600 vehicles supported the activities in 1993. 17,300 people received free medical care and 1,366 military and civilian communities benefitted from these efforts, which enhanced the relationships between the military and the civil population.

Education and Training: MND is developing progressive c.

environmental education and training programs to support establishment of a highly qualified environmental work force. Beginning in 1991, environmental education and training programs were established at the civil engineering departments in the following schools: the d .

Chinese Military Academy, the Chung Cheng Institute of Technology and the Air Force Mechanical School. In addition, a 2-hour course of instruction in environmental engineering was initiated at the field units and various branch schools.

The utility of environmental work force: to efficiently utilize reserve officers who possess an MOS in environmental science, MND has been selecting reserve officers who obtained master degrees in environmental engineering and assigning them the job of assisting environmental quality program management in the services' headquarters.

Environment protection for military engineering projects:
f.

MND has long put its focus on environmental protection for military construction sites. One of the good examples is the construction project of the Defense Medical Center.

Guards are put at the entrance of the construction site to ensure the tires and body of the gravel trucks are washed clean before they leave the site. Water is sprayed over the construction site to keep the dust down. All these efforts indicate MND's commitment to environmental protection.

Working with other environmental protection agencies:
g.

MND is working closely on cooperative environmental programs with other departments and agencies. The regular coordinating conference with the Environmental Protection Administration resulted in several major resolutions, such as noise control monitoring networks in military airfields and environmental training programs for military personnel sponsored by EPA. Additionally, all activities sponsored by EPA are fully supported by e.

MND both in manpower and funding.

Containing pollution and enhancing quality of life are the common wish of the general public. After 3 years of environmental cleanup actions, these efforts are showing results and have reduced pollution. MND will continue to make significant progress in all areas of environmental enhancement, especially in the field of environmental education and training programs to promote the armed forces' capability in fighting pollution.

# Coordination Between The Military And Society

## I. Correspondence With The Legislative Branch

Based on the ROC's constitution, the Legislative Yuan, the Control Yuan and the National Assembly are part of the legislative branch. To fully coordinate with the legislative branch, and promote legislators' understanding of the requirements of the Armed Forces, MND has been, both periodically and irregularly, stating its' philosophy, policies, functions and activities through MND's report to the congress, special subject report, interpellation, on-site inspections, visits and symposiums to drum up support.

During each session in the Legislative Yuan, Minister of MND, along with other responsible senior officers, present themselves to answer questions from the legislators. On the request from the Armed Forces Committe, joint sessions or any other committes, the Minister delivers the specific program report to the committes. In the past 2 years, 36 oral reports and 1,600 written statements covering a broad spectrum of military affairs were delivered.

As for on-site inspections, visits and various coordinating conferences, 76 units have been visited by members of the legislative branch and 190 conferences were held. Questions

raised during these visits and conferences are reviewed and provided full explanation. Also, during the past 2 years, petitions concerning the use of real property, the ownership of buildings, individual rights and issues related to military service, were signed by the public and submitted to the legislative branch for assistance.

To solidify coordination with the legislative branch and strengthen legislators' service to the public, liaison teams were activated by MND and the service headquarters to solicit support from the general public and the legislators through close internal coordination and external communication.

# Appeals From The People And The National Compensation

## Appeals From The People

For carrying out the spirit of the law and protecting people' s rights, the Ministry of National Defense has established the Petition Deliberative Committee according to the regulations of the Executive Yuan. Its main duty is to be responsible for making amends for administrative negligence. Any person can make appeals in compliance with the predetermined procedure as long as he thinks he has encountered a miscarriage of justice. Recently the majority of the appeals have been related to the applications of the Promised Land Deeds and the Veteran Certificates. It is estimated that a total of 442 events have been requested during the year of 1992 &
1993. After careful deliberation, rejected appeals number 206 cases and the number of the discharged cases which have been resettled are 30. As to the rest, 179 cases are either forwarded, discharged or closed; 27 cases are still pending. 103 cases have been reappealed to the Executive Yuan due to lack of the concession; among them there are 9 cases in which the Executive Yuan is undecided; and 7 cases were discharged and the rest of the 87 cases have been confirmed.

The accuracy of the jurisdiction is 98%. Hence the preservation of human rights and the practice of the law could be absolutely fulfilled.

## The National Compensation

In order to carry out the National Compensation Law
:
:

which was enacted on July 1, 1981, the Ministry of National Defense and the general headquarters (including the Armed Forces Reserve Command and the Military Police Command)
have jointly established the Compensation and Arbitration Council to manage national compensation events associated with MND. Up to the present, all the cases have been conducted justly and deliberately in accordance with the principles of the law seeking to accomplish the aim of National Compensation and the legal perservation of the people's rights.

(Table 5-5)

## The Ease Of Military Control And The Restricted Areas Iii.

Based on defense operational requirements and pertinent regulations, the purpose of military controls and restricted areas is to prevent unauthorized construction and access to classified areas and military installations. The controlled areas are divided into 4 categories: forts, critical military installations, coastal areas and mountain areas. Recently, in keeping with local economic development, MND has been, with minimum military security consideration, lenient toward easing these controlled areas.

l.

Forts:
There are 5 forts located in Keelung, Kaoshiung, Makung, Tachi and the eastern part of Taiwan. 57 pieces of land were under control. Since 1963, military control on 23 pieces of land has been lifted, and the remaining 34 pieces of land are still under control. No-construction zones near fortified places that can be defended against the enemy was narrowed from 400-600 meters of distance

away from the forts' perimeter down into the ridgeline.

Restricted areas for construction which extend 3,000–4,000 meters from the no-construction zone were narrowed into 150 meters within the ridgeline. The limited height for buildings inside the restricted areas was allowed to increase from 6-15 to 12-40 meters above the ground. 4 Controlled coastal areas:
2.

Coastal area control is designed to limit access to the 1,400 kilometer-long coast around the island of Taiwan.

Except for 50 swimming beaches which occupy 37 kilometers of seafront, all coastal areas within 500 meters of the high-water line were under control. Since the lifting of Martial Law, coastal area control was divided into
''regular controlled areas' and ''specific controlled areas''. 21 regular controlled areas in which military facilities exist are controlled on a 24-hour basis. 31 specific areas, which refer to coasts with security considerations are open to the public during daylight and under control in the night. The remaining coastal areas are all open to the public now. The length of the controlled coastal areas accounts for only 24.2%, much less than the total number before the Martial Law period.

The controlled mountain areas:
To ensure the public order in the mountain area, it is 3.

necessary for the government to impose control on the mountain area. Currently, except Lanyou, 29 mountain villages are still under control. Nevertheless, 40 highmountain areas have been listed as ''specific controlled mountain areas'', which are available for development and tourism. People who got permission from the

authorities can enter and exit these areas.

Critical military installations:
4.

They are divided by characteristics as follows:
Military airfields
(1) (2)
Alternate runways for war readiness
(3)
Missile sites
(4)
Permanent defense fortifications Potentially dangerous military training areas and
(5)
proving grounds or anti-dangerous equipment Potentially hazardous military factories, depots and
(6)
oil pumping stations Fixed military communication & electronic facilities
(7) 
After it was reviewed that the factors for military control no longer existed, 12 areas have been removed from control.

21 controlled places were narrowed, thus causing 1,000-plus hectares of land to be freed from control. 206 places are still under control. In the future, the scope for removing and narrowing control would be increased with military installations going underground or moving to remote places.

## Iv. Military Civil Actions

Smooth relationships between the military and the general public are also one of the important topics in national defense.

Only good relationships between the two sides can insure total combat power to be developed, and the final goal of defending the nation is achieved. Based on tradition, the Armed Forces spare no efforts at all levels in the field as disaster relief, harvest assistance, medical service, service for dependents and military engineering support. The general picture for military civic action is as follows:
Disaster relief, search & rescue:
1.

Disasters in the Taiwan area, either natural or manmade, are subject to typhoons, torrential rains, earthquakes, ship wrecks and accidents in mountain-climbing, which are the main cause of casulties. Targeting at these efforts, the Armed Forces developed various emergency and assistance programs, and initiated simulated exercises ranging from R&S, medical service, water supply to emergency transportation of materials. When disasters occur, all units concerned participate in disaster-relief efforts with their personnel and equipment. (Table 5-6)
Harvest assistance:
Taiwan used to be a farming society and the population 2.

in rural areas still accounts for a high percentage of the population. Since the 1960s, due to rapid economic development, rural youth has rushed to the urban areas, resulting in labour shortages in rural villages. To assist farming production and improve the livelihood of farmers, indigenous military forces are used to assist during harvest season, which contributes to improving prosperity in rural villages. (Table 5-7)
Medical service:
3.

To fully utilize medical facilities and manpower, medical service is offered not only to servicemen, military dependents and veterans, but also to people living in remote areas and low-income civilians. Additionally, medical treatment is given to the wounded, injured, or sick on an emergency basis. (Table 5-7)

## Enlisted Personnel Service:

This service only applies to conscripts, junior officers serving obligatory military service and family members of military cadets. Aspects of the service are as follows:
 After the conscripts reported to their assigned units,
(1)
commanders of the field units will inform conscripts' family members through correspondence that their sons are doing fine in the barracks. Within three months, information concerning conscripts' living conditions, training and current status is mailed to servicemen's information centers in various census bureaus where the enlistedmen's household register is kept. In the event that the family members of enlisted personnel suffer from serious illness or any

![287_Image_1.Png](287_Image_1.Png)

other misfortunes, the units to which the enlistees are assigned would ask the military service department in various local governments for assistance.

Military Personnel Service Center and various Servicemen's Information Centers, acting on requests from field units and servicemen's applications, provide assistance in financial support and legal disputes. Additionally, enlistedmen's families are informed of their children's behavior. In case bad performance is shown by any individual, coordination between the subject's family and his unit is initiated.

Enlistedmen's families that receive assistance from such actions have exceeded a quarter of the total families from which a conscript came. The purpose is to ensure conscripts to do their duty best and to reassure their families. (Table 5-9)

Military engineering support: As a rule, acting on request, the military would provide necessary engineering support for civic works, especially those time-pressing construction projects, or projects not defined in the private sector and construction delayed by labour shortage, only under the condition that the . performance of its normal missions will not be affected.

Provisioning to remote islands:
To effectively promote the quality of life of military men and citizens on remote islands and to meet the requirement of provision between Taiwan and remote islands, MND makes the best use of the present capacity of transportation for supporting the provision to remote islands. During 1993 the number of times for using vessels and commercial ships is 385, through which 123,505 persons, 211,041 tons of military supplies and living necessities are forwarded. This mission has met the timely need of people on remote islands and smoothly accomplished the mission of forwarding governmental and civilian organizations to remote islands.

## V. Ban-Lifting On Communication Frequency

According to ROC's "Telecommunication Law'', the communication frequencies used for military purposes are handled by MND, together with the Ministry of Communication --
the authorized agency for approving frequency. Based on the frequencies allocated to this Ministry by the "International Telecommunication Treaty & Wireless Radio Regulations'' and "Frequency Administration Regulations" as well as
''Regulations on the Control, Distribution And Interference of Military Radio Frequency'', MND gradually set up C3 system needed for armed forces' operation and training. So, the frequency scope and width of ROC's existing military communication electronics equipments are almost the same with those of various nations in the world. The overall conditions of frequencies used are as follows:
HF:  Applies to long distance, navigation communication 1.

and aided navigation facilities.

VHF: Applies to tactical purpose, short distance, naviga2.

tion and air communication.

3.

UHF:  Applies to aviation and short-distant district relay communication.

4.

SHF: Applies to microwave communication and radar, weapon systems.

In recent years, owing to the advancement of technology, the requirements for the frequencies from government, industrial and business circles and society are increasing day by day resulting in frequency deficiency. In order to coordinate with government's frequency-opening policy and under the premise of not affecting combat readiness, MND is going to revise the principles of communication frequency administration. The main principles for revision are:
1.

The military-proposed communication frequencies will be released to civil use under the premise of not affecting combat readiness and to cooperate with government's frequency ban-lifting policy.

. 2.

The adoption of brand-new technology products will be required while renovating armed forces communication equipment in the future and the frequency interval will be strictly controlled to make full use of frequency resources.

Avoid using communication bands of broadcast, TV and 3.

public communication while renovating equipment. The existent conditions of frequency released in coordination with this ban-lifting policy are as follows:
1.

TV Frequencies:
VHF: Two TV VHF have been suspended and utiliza.

ed by GIO to supply for the use of TV station.

UHF: Two UHF will be suspended and supplied for b.

the use of TV business by June 1994.

Broadcasting Frequencies: The frequency adjustment 2.

necessary for the open of FM broadcast has been completed, moreover; the frequencies used for broadcast have been reviewed continually.

## Vi. Force Demonstration Activity

In order to provide a better understanding of military combat readiness and training for the general public, this Ministry, in keeping with important national holidays and

festivals, holds force demonstrations, military history exhibitions, joint exercises and facilities open to the public on an annual basis. In the last two years, the number of people who witnessed these activities has increased markedly, because a lot of people are now more concerned about the defense affairs than ever before. (Table 5-11)

## Vii. Drumming Up Support

National defense, in a modern sense, is the defense for the people as a whole. The display of defense power relies not only on the combat readiness of the armed forces, but i the demonstration of total national power. How to use national power as the sound basis for national defense is one of the important topics in defense endeavor for any democratic nations. On its way to defense modernization, the following efforts will be made by MND to solicit support from the general public by the Armed Forces:
Stressing communication to promote mutual a. 

understanding: 
Communication is an effective and direct way to promote mutual understanding between the military and the civilian population. This Ministry spares no efforts in promoting mutual understanding by arranging visits, panel discussions, media reports and publishing the Defense White Paper on a bi-yearly basis, so people can have a better understanding of defense policy and current defense status.

b.

Good neighbor policy and upholding people's rights:
The development of a smooth relationship between the

military and the general public is an essential condition for soliciting support. Accordingly, besides various services rendered to the general public to promote the good neighbor policy, the Armed Forces spare no efforts in upholding people's rights. Issues-related to military service, land disputes, military control and restriction on building near military sites, are trying to be settled based on pertinent laws, regulations and sound reasoning. Additionally, the fact that members of the armed forces are from the society and they will return to the society one day, should be understood by our compatriots. The military is one of many forms of society and can not isolate itself from any other groups of the society. The society as a whole should not see the military as a different group. The problems derived from the military establishment are not individual phonomenen but dynamically interconnected with the society. These problems can be addressed only by reasonable interaction and close cooperation between the military and society. Therefore, it is only by strengthening the consensus that the military and society are part of a common destiny that our national security can be safeguarded.
