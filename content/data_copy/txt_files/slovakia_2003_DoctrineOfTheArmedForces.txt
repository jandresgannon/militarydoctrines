-----

The Doctrine of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic complements the system of the

strategic political and military documents with an important link. Its application shall support

the training, preparation and effective employment of the Armed Forces of the Slovak

Republic for military operations. It contains principles for the joint use of the components of

the armed forces in military operations during peacetime, in crisis situations and during armed

conflicts. It is based on knowledge of modern military science and is developed in such a way

that the commanders might master basics of military art, applied within the forces of NATO

member states, at the level that enables them to increase operational readiness of our armed

forces continuously and to develop capabilities needed for the defence of the Slovak Republic

and for accomplishment of commitments based on the international treaties.

0.01 **Purpose. The Doctrine of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic represents the**
highest doctrinal document of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic and is
intended to form the basis for the development all subordinate doctrines. The
purpose of this document is to provide a principal base for the planning and conduct
of military operations.

0.02 **Scope. The Doctrine of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic contains pragmatic**
solutions and flexible approaches to the conduct of operations on all levels, with a
special focus on maneuver warfare, joint operations and combined operations. The
Doctrine is based on theoretical knowledge and real war experience of various
countries. The application of such knowledge and experience is a precondition for
successful conduct of operations by the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic. The
Doctrine presents another level of elaboration of strategic documents approved by
the National Council of the Slovak Republic. Its application will enable the Armed
Forces of the Slovak Republic to respond to challenges and face threats both in the
near and more distant future. The Doctrine may be applied in a whole scale of
military operations, starting from peacekeeping missions, through military operations
other then war to major armed conflicts. Looking at the definition of the Doctrine as
‘fundamental principles by which military forces guide their actions in support of
objectives“, we can say that it provides a framework and guidance for accomplishing
the mission of the armed forces in all their activities, including basic and further
training, re-supplies and sustaining. No provision of this doctrine has a dogmatic
character and it must not in any manner restrict the commanders at all echelons in
fullfilling their tasks in accordance with the mission of the armed forces. The
Doctrine also provides the basis for further development of all components of the
state’s fighting power.

0.03 **Applicability.** The Doctrine applies to all elements of the armed forces. The
Doctrine is binding on all members of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic. If
there are any discrepancies between the principles of this doctrine and other
doctrines, the text hereof shall prevail over other military doctrines. Exceptions from
these principles will be published by the Chief of General Staff of the Armed Forces
of the Slovak Republic through specific instructions. Commanders of military units
under international command shall observe the principles of international doctrines,
provided they were ratified by the competent authority of the Slovak Republic. The
Doctrine shall be also applied in support of non-military operations, in which
components of the armed forces are deployed.

0.04 **Base. The Doctrine of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic was prepared by the**
designated working group. As a basis to prepare this doctrine, the authors used the
approved fundamental strategic documents, such as the Long-term Plan of Structure
and Development of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic – Model 2010, NATO
doctrines, allied publications and the doctrines of individual NATO member states.
We can mention especially the following: Allied Joint Operations Doctrine (AJP-1),
British Defence Doctrine (BDD), Joint Warfare of the Armed Forces of the United
States (JP-1), Doctrine of the Armed Forces of the Kingdom of the Netherlands,
especially the Military Doctrine. To ensure compliance with common terminology

4


-----

required in joint operations, the doctrine uses English terms and abbreviations to the
extent necessary.

0.05 To the extent possible, key doctrines for the strategic command level shall be
prepared in accordance with NATO standard allied military doctrines, especially the
following: SVD-10 (personnel management); SVD-20 (intelligence and EB), SVD30 (planning and commanding joint operations); SVD-40 (logistic support of joint
operations); SVD-50 (deliberate planning); SVD-60 (command support). The
principles and procedures for each area of activity will be contained in the basic
doctrines of the respective Military Departments of the armed forces. Subordinate
doctrine, documents, standard operating procedures and operational guidelines will
be issued by the competent authorities of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic.

1.01 Efficient security and defense are deciding for the preservation of values important to
the citizens of the Slovak Republic, such as freedom, sovereignty, territorial
integrity, sovereignity of borders, democratic order, protection of life, health and
basic rights and freedoms, credibility of the state based on ability to fulfill the
country’s obligations arising out of international treaties and agreements, as well as
the capability to resolve critical situations and to face threats of violence and
aggression. Therefore, security and defense are the focus of attention of the state’s
power and of its citizens. Base for state activities in this area are analyses of security
environment and political strategic decisions taken to accomplish interests of the
Slovak Republic.

1.02 Strategic analyses of the international and security environment are carried out in the
Slovak Republic in several basic dimensions described in this chapter. The
evaluation of the situation from the political and strategic point of view represents a
complex overview of the situation by combining all dimensions. The goal of such
evaluation is to identify the most probable challenges for the foreign and defense
policy of the Slovak Republic in a dynamically changing geopolitical environment.
Following the changes in the environment, the strategic documents and the resulting
doctrines are constantly reviewed. Individual dimensions of the strategic
environment might be of different importance, depending on the circumstances.

1.03 **The political and legal dimension encompasses the identification of allies, neutral**
or non-participating countries and enemies in a particular situation, including the
assessment of their respective importance. Each component of the international
environment requires a specific approach. There are various regional characteristics,
especially the relationships with the neighboring countries and strategic partners.
International organizations and the system of international law have also their
specific status, capabilities and missions. Humanitarian and ethical aspects of
resolving international disputes and crises are of increasing importance. They have a
growing influence on political decisions on the use of the armed forces and on the
limiting conditions for their deployment. Traditionally, the worst predictable
components of the strategic environment are non-state political entities, including
semi-military and terrorist organizations having their own specific features.

5


-----

1.04 The economic and social dimension applies to the assignment of resources to resolve
a particular situation and represents the most important component of all processes
taking place in the strategic environment. Economic tools of resolving emerging
crises, together with political, diplomatic and military tools form the decisive pillars
of the state’s power. The power of a country’s economy determines the level of its
scientific and technological development, the informational level of society and its
armed forces and both the strengths and vulnerabilities of the society. The social and
economic situation of the population decides on the public support of particular
solutions and has direct impacts on riots or other activities threatening the internal
stability of the society and the public order. The social structure of the society and
the differences in cultural values influence several aspects of the country’s fight
potential, such as the morale of the armed forces, the respected values, the conduct of
operations etc.

1.05 **The military strategic dimension** is focused on the warfighting potential of the
Slovak Republic and other countries that could have an influence on the development
in the strategic environment and on the accomplishment of strategic objectives by
allies or potential enemies. In addition to that, this dimension takes into account the
possibilities and types of deployment of the armed forces, the possible approaches to
the conduct of war operations and their impact on the capability of the armed forces.
In a democratic society, the authority to decide on the use of the armed forces is
vested in the political leaders and the armed forces play just an advisory role.

1.06 **The physical dimension** represents the elements of the physical environment that
influence the conditions for conflict and crisis resolution, including geographic
conditions, terrain elements, weather and natural resources of strategic commodities.
Traditional strategic raw materials, including oil products and other energy sources
or the availability of water and agricultural products are of particular importance.
The strategic environment is significantly influenced by demographic characteristics,
industrialization and urbanization. These factors, which, from the viewpoint of
military operations, have independent influence, might be supportive of or present
obstacles to the development of processes in all their dimensions.

1.07 From the above dimensions of the strategic environment, the basic tools of political
strategy follow. Accomplishment of political and strategic objectives of the state in
an international environment depends on the overall position of the state in the
international community. The state’s political strategic tools include diplomatic,
economic and military tools.

1.08 Diplomatic power of a state represents its ability to negotiate, reach agreement and
win allies in the pursuit of its objectives; as well as its ability to use the power of
arguments and political tools with the help of economic and military potential to
advance its national interests. Good diplomacy represents a combination of
international reputation and political integrity, backed by economic stability and
military potential. Diplomatic tools are used before, during and after the conflict.

1.09 The state’s economic potential encompasses several aspects, including business
opportunities, investment ability, capital base, the education level of population and
the ability to apply economic sanctions, embargos and other coercive measures. The

6


-----

use of the state’s economic potential may have controversial results in certain
circumstances.

1.10 The state’s military assets represent the most severe means to advance the state’s
interests and should be used only after all other tools failed. Political leaders must
consider the possibility and the limits of using military tools. Improper or untimely
use of military tools, failure to respond to the whole scale of emerging challenges,
and failure to meet international obligations might result into the loss of reputation
and degrade the value of other political strategic tools.

1.11 The decision as to the use of military force is dependant upon the level of the threat
confronting the state.. These levels are taken into account during defining objectives
and priorities, military goals and limitations for the use of combat potential. A
political strategic objective might be to deter the potential enemy from aggression, to
early terminate the conflict, to create favorable conditions for later negotiations, to
defend strategic connections and maintain the conflict at the lowest level possible.
The theoretical and political principles of the strategy are contained in documents
related to the security and defense of state. The content of this strategy is included
especially in the basic documents approved by the National Council of the Slovak
Republic.

**THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT OF THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC AT THE**
**BEGINNING OF THE 21[ST] CENTURY**

1.12 As to the security environment, its development at the beginning of the 21[st] century
can be characterized as the end of the confrontation between two military blocks with
decreased probability of a global conflict and the continuing integration of Central
and Eastern European countries into North Atlantic Alliance and the EU. Growing
impacts of globalization and accelerated economic, technological, cultural and
political integration between countries with people coming closer to each other
presents a new momentum for civilization processes. On the other hand, this
tendency poses new risks and threats related to the growing imbalance in the
development of the world’s regions as a consequence of limited ability of certain
countries to deal with the challenges and make use of the opportunities brought by
the information era, new technologies, extensive exploitation of the outer space and
revolutions in the military area.

1.13 As to its area, population and economic potential, the Slovak Republic ranks among
smaller countries with limited military power, seen from both the world´s and
European perspective. Slovakia’s geographic location, limited energy and mineral
resources, the structure of its economy and the historical development link Slovakia
economically, politically and culturally to countries integrated in the European
Union, NATO, the Central European Free Trade Agreement and the European Free
Trade Association. The Slovak Republic must develop its future in cooperation with
these countries as surprise and asymmetric means and ways to accomplish political
goals may be used by an enemy in future conflicts.

1.14 The military strategy of the Slovak Republic distinguishes between two types of
security threats, which would require engagement of the armed forces – military and
non-military threats.

1.15 **Military threats to the Slovak Republic are activities primarily involving the use of**
military forces which directly threaten the security of the Slovak Republic. Within
the category of military threats, the military strategy distinguishes between two types
of conflicts

    - major armed conflict with significant impacts on vital affairs of the state,

    - regional armed conflicts.

1.16 After the likelihood of external military threats decreased due to the fading threat of
global confrontation, the Slovak Republic and other countries now face the problem
of growing probability of regional conflicts in regions which are in the area of
national interest of the Slovak Republic

1.17 **Non-military threats are, according to the Military Strategy of the Slovak Republic,**
those security-threatening activities, in which primarily non-military means are
employed. Non-military threats include terrorist activities, illegal weapons transfer,
international crime, uncontrolled migration or massive refugee flow; religious or

8


-----

ethnic extremism and rivalries; social unrest; and a number of other activities that
may lead to armed conflict, if unresolved. Non-military threats also include natural
disaster and major ecological accidents, with limited predictability of their
occurrence.

1.18 Non-military threats can be instigated intentionally or evolve and grow naturally.
The use of the military force, as allowed by law, in these cases may prevent from
crisis evolving, reduce its effects and help to remove consequences of crises.

**SECURITY AND DEFENCE SYSTEM OF THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC**

1.19 In order to influence the security environment effectively, the roles and competencies
of state authorities and the relationships between them must be clearly defined and
systematically organized, following the principles of a legal and democratic state.
The security and defense system of the Slovak republic are the integral parts of the
state control. This provides the National Council of the Slovak Republic, the
Government, the President and other state and regional authorities with the necessary
mechanisms to make use of their authorities in crises situations in order to preserve
or reestablish security. These authorities are supported by established control and
advisory bodies which ensure that all components of the both systems are constantly
ready and operable. This applies mainly to the ability to analyze the security
environment, to identify individual threats and the level of risks involved, to
determine procedures and measures to eliminate such threats, to resolve crisis
situations, to provide the necessary resources, to ensure their proper use and to
coordinate deployment of forces and equipment to prevent, mitigate and resolve
crisis situations and conflicts.

1.20 **The National Council of the Slovak Republic** is the only legislative body of the
Slovak Republic capable to amend the Constitution. In accordance with the
Constitution and other laws related to security and defense, the Council’s
competencies include deciding on fundamental questions of security and defense of
the state; endorsing fundamental conceptions, strategic documents, developing
programs and plans for state´s security and defense including allocation of financial
resources. The National Council passes a declaration of war resolution, if the Slovak
Republic is attacked or if it results from common defense obligations pursuant to
international treaties, and concluding peace treaties.

1.21 **The President** is the head of the Slovak Republic representing the state both
internally and externally. By his decisions, he ensures the proper functioning of
constitutional bodies. As regards the state’s security and defense he may declare and
terminate a state of emergency, war and order partial or full-scale mobilization of the
Armed Forces based on a proposal of the Government of the Slovak Republic. He
may declare war based on a resolution of the National Council, if the Slovak
Republic is attacked or it follows from its common defense obligations pursuant to
international treaties; and may sign peace treaties. The president of the Slovak
Republic has powers of the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces.

1.22 **The Government of the Slovak Republic is the highest executive body responsible**
for the state’s security and defense. The government and its members have to report
to the National Council. The government endorses conceptions of the security and

9


-----

defense system of the state, decides in quorum on proposals to declare or terminate
a state of emergency; war, state of war and mobilization of the Armed Forces.

1.23 **The Security Council of the Slovak Republic** is the government’s supreme lawmaking body advising it on issues related to the state’s security and foreign policy. In
peacetime the Security Council of the Slovak Republic is to participate in the
creation of a security system, the fulfillment of international security obligations, and
evaluation of the security environment. The Council is to prepare proposals to ensure
security and to prevent and resolve crisis situations for the Government. During
wartime and state of war if the Government is unable to play its role the Council
takes over these competencies until the Government is ready renew its acting.

1.24 **Ministries and other state administration bodies, county offices, district offices**
**and higher territorial units** are, in times of peace, responsible for organizing
preparations for wartime, state of war or national emergency.

1.25 In a state of emergency or in other crisis situations, **crisis management staffs** are
created at the level of the government, the ministries and other state administration
bodies, county offices, county security councils, district offices and district security
councils and municipalities. The Central Crisis Staff at the level of the government
and other crisis staffs at lower levels are the executive bodies of crisis management
to coordinate the acting of state administration bodies, county offices, and other
elements participating in crisis resolving. They propose measures to prevent, carry
out civil emergency planning, collect information and organize preparations for crisis
situations.

Figure 2 – Decision making process concerning the State´s security and defense

**PREPARATIONS AND CONTROL OF DEFENCE OF THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC**

1.26 **Preparations for the state’s defense comprise all measures enabling the country’s**
efficient defense. In this respect, the key measures are the creation and preparation of
the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic in accordance with the Constitution and
other laws of the Slovak Republic, respecting the role of the Armed Forces and their
mission to ensure state defense.

1.27 Besides the mentioned bodies responsible for adopting resolutions in the area of
defense and defense management within the defense system, a vital role is played
also by other state administration bodies, self-administration bodies, legal entities
and individuals and the system’s active components, such as the Armed Forces,
armed troops, firefighters and rescue workers.

11


-----

1.28 In wartime or in a state of war, the **main defense management unit is created for**
the Prime Minister, the President, the Vice Chairman of the Security Council and its
members.

1.29 Defense planning is based on the planning principles applied in the state’s security
system. Defense planning, in turn, provides the base for key decisions by the highest
state authorities, to be passed in the form of strategic policy directives and defense
directives. The goal of the planning process is to create conditions for the control and
coordination of all of the defense system components with the view of creating,
maintaining and exploiting the defense capabilities to protect the state and provide
for its security.

1.30 **Defense planning is based on the regular review of defense requirements by the**
**Defense Planning Committee, established by the Security Council of the Slovak**
Republic. The objective of the defense planning is to coordinate the long-term
processes of building defense capacities and military abilities with the national
interests and strategic defense and security goals and to balance the financial
resources with decisions on the use of such resources for defense.

1.31 The basic **tool** for defense planning is the system of **planning, programming and**
**budgeting. The procedures and principles of defense planning are coordinated by the**
Ministry of Defense usually for a period of six years. It controls the defense planning
by issuing defense planning directives, which are issued usually once in two years.
The paramount goal of the planning, programming and budgeting system is to assign
the necessary resources to defense in accordance with the requirements of the
strategic documents. Defense planning ensures availability and efficient use of
resources assigned to defense. The state can assign to the Armed Forces only
a limited amount of resources, taking into account the demographic and economic
characteristics of the country.

1.32 An integral part of plans of development of the armed forces and of objectives of the
armed forces are requirements for the standardization of the Armed Forces of the
**Slovak Republic.** Such standardization creates an adequate basis for the exploitation
of the defense planning and for the setting of priorities in building expected military
capabilities according to operational needs and criteria of **operational**
**interoperability applied within NATO. From doctrinal point of view, the key area of**
standardization is operational standardization. Operational standardization applies to
both the current and future forms, methods and procedures of building the armed
forces, to the preparation of concepts, to the training and support of the armed forces
and to the preparation and keeping of documentation.

**THE ARMED FORCES OF THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC**

1.33 **The Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic** are created for the purpose of
preserving peace and security, providing the state’s defense and fulfilling the
countries obligations arising out of international treaties. They are the key active
component of the defense system. The requirements for the roles and missions of the
Armed Forces are defined in more detail in the respective laws and are further
elaborated in the Military Strategy of the Slovak Republic. To fulfill the established

12


-----

roles, the mechanism of joint command and control of the Armed Forces in
peacetime, crisis situations, state of war or wartime is created.

1.34 Civil control of the Armed Forces is the process, in which the Government of the
Slovak Republic and the Ministry of Defense make decisions about engagement of
the Armed Forces and their directing. In political controlling the Armed Forces, the
principles of civil governance and democratic control are being applied.

1.35 **The Armed Forces Command is the process, in which a commander gives, at his**
level of the responsibility, orders to accomplish the tasks set to the Armed Forces.
Command to the Armed Forces is performed not only by the President of the Slovak
Republic as the highest commander of the Armed Forces, but by the Chief of the
General Staff of the Armed Forces and others designated commanders within their
level of responsibility.

1.36 The fundamental document issued by the Chief of the General Staff related to
defense planning is the Plan of defense requirements and capabilities prepared by
the requirements definition and deliberate planning personnel of the General Staff in
collaboration with the other components of the General Staff and the commands of
all branches of the Armed Forces.

1.37 The General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic ensures command to
the Armed Forces at the expert, technical and administrative level. If, in peacetime, a
crisis occurs, the General Staff is transformed to the Slovak Military Command
Center which in wartime acts as the Main Command Post of the Armed Forces. Its
main task is to ensure a smooth development and command to the armed forces in
wartime or state of war.

**DECIDING ON THE ENGAGEMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES ACCORDING TO**
**THE PURPOSE AND TYPE OF ENGAGEMENT**

1.38 A successful political strategy concerning the use of the military forces to counter a
military or non-military threat is dependent upon an early response to the changes in
the security environment, on forecasts of future development, on an objective
analysis of the threat, on the ability to respond to unpredicted developments and on
the willingness to cooperate with other elements of the security and defense system
in influencing the relationships and the situation in the security environment. From
this point of view, the engagement of the armed forces and their missions can be
classified according to three basic conditions and situations, which result from
relationships between groups of countries, countries, nations, communities and other
elements of the society. This applies to peacetime, crisis situations and conflict.

1.39 **Peace** is a state, in which existing and occurring differences in interests and
objectives, misunderstandings and disputes are resolved without the use of war or
armed conflict. The positions and the behavior of key players influencing the
international environment and the situation inside the society can be characterized by
coexistence, collaboration, cooperation, willingness to observe national and
international laws, commitment to maintain the balance and stability and
determination to use primarily the means of economic and political competition to

13


-----

prevent crisis situations and conflicts. For dispute resolution, legal, political,
diplomatic, economic and other means are applied. In peacetime, the readiness of the
armed forces is raised to the appropriate level to enable the accomplishment of their
tasks with respect to training and preparation, creation of mobilization reserves and
an adequate response to potential threats.

1.40 **A Crisis Situation** is an incident or situation involving an immediate threat to the
peace and security of the state, its constitutional arrangement, health and life of its
citizens and possessions as a consequence of factors degrading the balance of powers
and stability, or its national interests. The peak of a crisis situation might be a turning
point towards peace and restoration of stabile condition; or it might escalate to an
open conflict and war. From the viewpoint of security, national interests and the
strategy and procedures applied in crisis management, these threats can be divided
into military and non-military ones. Depending on the situation, decisions are
adopted concerning the extent and type of commitment of the armed forces in crisis
resolution. If the crisis situation was caused by military threats, the armed forces
should eliminate the causes of crises and conflicts by discouraging the potential
enemy from the use of violence or aggression. In the case of non-military threats, the
armed forces use their military capabilities and specific abilities to support civil
authorities.

1.41 **Conflict is the result of escalation of a crisis situation caused by following the**
opposite and incompatible interests. Both sides of conflict make effort to establish
their own will by defeating the other side. According to used means conflict can be
military or non-military. War is the most extreme form of conflict of interests and
disputes among states or societal groups inside a state. The primary means to resolve
the escalating dispute and to achieve political objectives is armed force, which is
used with the view of deciding the conflict and forcing the enemy to accept the will
of his opponent. In a war between two states, the military forces of the state are the
main tool of carrying on warfare and accomplishing the political objectives.

**OPERATIONAL PLANNING**

1.42 **Operational planning** is a natural part of command, with the commander guiding
the planning process and eventually deciding on the appropriate course of action
(COA) to be taken in any given operation or campaign. As distinct from the defense
**planning, the goal of which is to prepare plans of development of the armed forces**
and their capabilities; operational plans contain concepts for the use of the armed
forces and their actual capabilities to resolve a particular situation. The extent of
operational planning and its methods are dependent on the time available. When
planning an operational engagement of forces, we distinguish generally between two
categories of operational planning: deliberate planning and crisis planning.

1.43 **Deliberate/advanced planning refers to the initiation and preparation of plans based**
on expected scenarios of situation development in the future. As part of the
deliberate planning process, an **operational planning** **working group** (PSOP) is
created at the strategic level of command (MoD/General Staff of the Armed Forces).
The responsibility for the activities of the operational planning working group
(PSOP) and its members and the group’s basic tasks are defined in doctrine SVD-30.
The main deliverables of the deliberate planning process include standing defense
plans and contingency operational plans.

1.44 **Standing Defense Plans (SDP) contain solutions to projected military threats. These**
plans usually contain information on the required capabilities, alert times, types of
deployment and command and control responsibilities in such an operation.
Responsibility for the preparation of standing defense plans and the planning
procedures are defined in doctrine SVD-30.

1.45 **Contingency operational plans** (CONOPLAN) contain solutions to expected
alternative situations and threats including rapidly developing non-military ones, in
which military forces may be deployed. The basic responsibilities for the preparation
of contingency operational plans and the planning procedures are defined in doctrine
SVD-30.

1.46 **Crisis** **response** **planning. In the case of rapidly and unexpectedly developing crisis**
situations that require the deployment of the armed forces, the method of crisis
response planning is applied. Crisis response planning is a process of initiating and
preparing plans to respond to an actual or emerging crisis situation. The outcome of
crisis response planning is the **operation plan** (OPLAN) and related documents
described in doctrine SVD-30. If the emerging crisis corresponds to any of the
standing defense plans or contingency operational plans, they are to be used as a base
for the crisis response planning.

1.47 **Operation plan** (OPLAN) is a plan prepared in response to an actual or emerging
crisis on the basis of initiating directive by the competent crisis authority. An
operation plan represents the final product of the crisis response planning and is
prepared in sufficient detail to be used as a basis for the approval and conduct of
operations. Supporting plans are plans dealing with individual areas of support and
are supplementary products of the crisis response planning.

2.01 The following chapters contain the basic principles, which should be followed by
commanders and staffs when planning, preparing and conducting military operations.
War has certain distinctive characteristics. Knowledge and creative exploitation of
these characteristics has a deciding influence on the successful use of armed power in
war, in order to attain political objectives. Modern military science recognizes four
levels of war: Operations are planned and conducted at all levels. Borderlines among
these levels cannot be drawn mechanically and do not reflect command levels
precisely.

**CHARACTERISTICS OF WAR**

2.02 The Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic recognize five characteristics of a war**conflict:**

    - **War is a tool of politics.** Success of a war is measured not by the number of
casualties, nor by the area of seized territory, but by the accomplishment of
political objectives and by introducing of peace. Political objectives in a war are
the deciding factors influencing military objectives and the scope and strength of
military operations.

    - **War is organized violence.** A war conflict can be distinguished from other
coercive political tools by the use of organized armed violence. The use of violent
means add emotional and irrational elements to the war, on both sides of the
conflict. This in turn influences the approach in carrying on the conflict. The
understanding of this phenomenon of an armed conflict helps to maintain certain
reasonable limitations from the viewpoint of destructive effects of war.

    - **War is characterized by uncertainty. The outcome of war is not sure and cannot**
be predicted due to the dangers and the “fog” surrounding the war. Proper
command, knowledge of doctrinal principles and training may help to limit the
extent of natural uncertainty.

    - **War is carried on by people.** War is carried on by groups of people and their
values, morality, habits, characteristics, esprit de corps and determination have a
direct influence on the manner of warfare. Nowadays a armed conflict takes place
before the eyes of the public, the public opinion also influences the manner how
the conflict is carried on.

    - **Key role played by the command. Since war is a human activity, the quality of**
military and political leadership has a decisive effect onto the war efforts. Proper
command helps to encourage the troops to accomplish the objectives of a war
conflict, despite of the present dangers. Leadership of commanders is dependent
on the commandant’s personal qualities, leadership capabilities and professional
experience.

2.03 **Features of war. War is generally a complex issue. In addition to the accompanying**
manifestation of war, including fear, exhaustion, danger, uncertainty and
coincidence, we recognize several significant features, which might help us to
understand the nature of a war conflict.

2.04 **Contradiction of war** is a feature that reflects the myriad number of factors and
events influencing war itself. The contradiction of war can be fully recognized only
in a real war and its complexity and variability cannot be fully controlled. The
examples of failure of equipment, unexpected tough resistance by enemy, distorted
orders, etc. confirm that the contradiction cannot be excluded from war. War is a
battle between the wills of the two fighting parties and the task of the commander is
to force his will on the enemy, while taking into account the contradictions of war.

2.05 **Defense and attack are two alternating stages of military operations, where neither**
of them might be regarded as dominant. In general, defense is less demanding than
attack. On the other hand, only an attack might bring about the decisive victory in
war. The attack enables one side to seize the initiative by selecting the time, place,
force and manner of an engagement.

17


-----

2.06 In every situation, there are key elements that have a higher influence on efficient
conduct of operations. Damage to or loss of such elements has a disproportional
impact on the accomplishment of objectives. Thus, the identification and exploitation
of such elements requires particular attention. **Centers of gravity** (COG) might be
either of a material or immaterial character. The strongest effect is produced by
hitting such a center of gravity, disrupting the capability and willingness of the
enemy to carry on the conflict. Ideally, the our main effort should be focused on
enemy’s weakness and our center of gravity should represent our strength.

Figure 5. Several significant features of war

2.07 **The Human element is a deciding factor in battle. Military operations are eventually**
won by people. This factor, often referred to as the factor of morale, includes farsighted, deliberate, creative and strong leadership, capabilities and courage of
personnel, esprit de corps, training of individuals and units, adequacy and knowledge
of principles of the use of the military forces, the high level of readiness and
discipline. The human element relates to the following features of a war conflict:

2.08 **Chaos. Due to its human character, the features of a war include uncertainty and**
chaos produced by the “fog of war” due to constant incompleteness, inaccuracy and
contradiction of information.

2.09 **Danger. The use of armed violence or the threat to use the same produces a danger**
that demonstrates itself as fear for the conflict participants.

2.10 **Stress.** The effects of danger, fear, exhaustion and loneliness negatively influence
the people, produce stress and weaken the will of the conflict participants. To defeat

an enemy, it is necessary to degrade the will of its forces and to maintain the will to
win and moral strength among one’s own forces.

2.11 **Situational factor.** Each conflict is unique due to the broad scale of factors
influencing it. The success of military operations requires not only the understanding
of the principles of warfare and the effective use of the armed forces. Creative
application of the human most distinguishing ability, which is intelligence and the
ability to think, depends on the understanding of the situation and conditions, under
which the conflict takes place. Such understanding depends on knowledge, which is
dependent on information. Each situation requires particular conceptual solutions and
an appropriate strategy.

**POLITICAL STRATEGIC LEVEL OF WAR**

2.12 **The political strategic level** is the level of constitutional bodies having certain
competencies concerning the defense of the state. At the Parliament, Government,
and the Presidential-level, the resources of the state are used for the purpose of
achieving political objectives. Constitutional bodies have usually several options
available to resolve a crisis and to accomplish the strategic objectives. The
authorities at the political strategic level decide on the allocation of resources to
individual lines of effort, they define the end state and the limitations and provide
general political instructions. Under specific conditions, constitutional bodies decide
in defense-related questions in cooperation with other states or they use the
opportunities provided by international organizations concerned with international
security, such as the UN, OSCE, EU and NATO.

2.13 Political decisions as to the priorities and appropriate strategy are passed in a manner
to support the integrity of all elements of state policy in crisis situations, to which the
Slovak Republic will respond by declaring war, state of war, state of readiness, state
of emergency and other extraordinary measures. In peacetime or in a stabilized state,
such decisions enable to create adequate resources and to build the required
capabilities, which could be used in crisis situations or in a threat of war.

2.14 The art of political strategy depends on realistic future forecasts, readiness to respond
to future challenges and to take appropriate risks, to prevent crisis situations and the
ability to respond to them and eliminate their consequences. An integral part of
political strategy is the ability to properly assess enemy objectives and intentions,
probable reactions to the course of the armed conflict or war and the willingness and
readiness to use the fighting power to protect his national interests.

2.15 The strategic level of command and crisis resolution at the highest political level is
carried out by the Government in accordance with the applicable laws. The
Government delegates responsibility for the resolution of particular types of crises to
individual Ministers or to the Central Crisis Staff. The Government has, at the
political strategy level, various means and tools available to resolve a particular crisis
situation. Military means are usually used as the last option to resolve a such
situation. In relation to planning of military operations, the authorities at the political
strategic level decide on the allocation of resources to operations, they define the
political objectives of operations, and the limits of state´s institutions involvement
and armed forces engagement.

19


-----

2.16 The Government might decide to delegate crisis management and resolution to the
Minister of Defense of the Slovak Republic, who in turn, might ask the other
Ministries and their respective authorities to participate in the process. Monitoring of
alert and warning indicators of strategic importance is the responsibility of
intelligence organizations, which follow the decisions and instructions issued by
government authorities.

2.17 To serve the planning needs at the political strategy level, the Minister of Defense of
the Slovak Republic establishes a Committee for Military Strategic Analyses
(VVSA). The permanent members of the Committee include the representatives of
individual sections of the Ministry of Defense and staff representatives of the general
staff at the level of department or administration chiefs. VVSA participates in the
preparation of a grand strategic estimate, in cooperation with the other ministries.
The grand strategic estimate represents a combination of the planning process carried
out by the Government and the ministries.

2.18 **A political strategic directive from the governmental-level, the Security Council of**
the Slovak Republic or the Central Crisis Staff defines the priorities and goals to be
followed. Together with the applicable laws, it creates the conditions for military
engagement and is binding on state authorities. If necessary, it also sets the
limitations required to conduct each of the activities and to apply the selected means
and measures. In a multinational operation, under NATO command or the command
of another international organization, it is replaced by political directives of the
North Atlantic Council or the competent authorities of the international organization
concerned.

**MILITARY-STRATEGIC LEVEL OF WAR**

2.19 **The Military-Strategic level** refers to the application of military resources to
accomplish the established political objectives. The theoretical principles to be
followed are contained in military doctrines and military strategic documents. At this
level, the defense plans are prepared, the criteria for operational capabilities of the
armed forces are set and the resources required for successful planning of operations
ensured.

2.20 The military strategic level of crisis management and planning of operations and
other issues related to the defense of the state corresponds to the level of the Ministry
of Defense together with the main officials of the General Staff of the Slovak
Republic, including the commanders of the components of the Armed Forces. From
a multinational viewpoint, the level of military strategy includes the decisionmaking processes within NATO military authorities. At the level of military strategy,
decisions on the opportunities to provide military support to a particular activity are
passed, taking account of the requirements of political objectives.

2.21 At the military-strategic level, continuous monitoring of areas of potential conflicts
are performed to enable the adoption of the required measures as soon as possible
within the decision-making cycle and to create room for operational planning and
preparation. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic is the
organization, where the strategic level and the operational level of war overlap.

20


-----

2.22 In the preparatory stage of an operation, the tasks of the strategic military bodies
include: specification of military conditions to achieve the desired end state; setting
of political, financial and legal limitations for the engagement of the armed forces in
a particular operation; preparation of military strategic objectives to accomplish the
political objectives of an operation; allocation of forces and resources in support of
those objectives; definition of an operational zone for the joint operations
commander; appointing a commander of the joint task force and setting of command
mechanisms and command and control structures in a particular operation.

2.23 The military strategic body issuing the Military Strategic Directive for a particular
operation to the operational commander is the Chief of the General Staff of the
Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic. All main representatives of the Ministry of
Defense of the Slovak Republic contribute to this Directive at the expert level.. The
operational commander receives, through the directive, a balanced list of military
objectives, guidance for the conduct of operations to accomplish the established
objectives, along with the required resources.

2.24 The military strategic directive of the Chief of the General Staff is called **CGS`s**
**Planning Directive and represents an initiating directive. It is based on the overall**
strategic estimate prepared by governmental crisis authorities and decisions of the
respective authorities of the Ministry of Defense. The planning directive is issued to
the joint force commander. Details are stipulated in the planning and conduct of joint
operations doctrine, SVD-30.

**OPERATIONAL AND TACTICAL LEVEL OF WAR**

2.25 **The operational level refers to the management of military resources to accomplish**
the military strategic objectives. At this level, campaigns and main operations are
planned and operational objectives established in order to accomplish strategic
objectives. This level is characterized by joint operations. At this level, a sequence of
activities is prepared and available means are planned, by which the tactical level
succeeds in the battle.

2.26 The operational level provides for the link between military strategic objectives and
the tactical engagement of troops. At this level, operations and campaigns are
planned, ensured and directed, and executed. The basic responsibility of the
operational commander is to prepare and execute an operational plan to achieve the
operation end state within the defined zone of operations.

2.27 **The tactical level characterized by the art of applying military power in direct**
contact with the enemy, relates to the use of available military resources to
accomplish operational objectives. The tactical level is concerned with the use of
particular weapon systems in a changing environment and in a particular situation
with the view of accomplishing operational objectives. Modern operations have
combined and joint character even at the lowest tactical level. The tactical level is the
level at which individual battles and contacts are planned and carried out within the
overall campaign or a large-scale operation.

Figure 6 - Levels of conducting military operations

22..2288 In reality, it is difficult to draw a distinct line between the individual levels of war
and there will always be an element of overlap. Technological advances in weapon
systems and communication technologies, significant improvement of real time
overview of the situation, combined with the influence of the media in the current
conflicts all cause that constitutional representatives at the political strategy level
want to control detailed tactical issues of the conflict. Thus, decentralization
processes based on the requirements of the maneuver warfare are guided by hyper
centralization tendencies. In multinational operations, the borders between individual
levels of warfare may be even more unclear. For example, the use of even a
relatively small unit in a liberation campaign might have operational or even
strategic importance.

22..2299 The goal of the planning process at each level is to specify the objective, the methods
for its accomplishment and the appropriate resources required. There are three basic
criteria of evaluation as to whether a particular activity at a lower level influences the
higher levels. They are: political context of the particular activity; the influence of
the activity on the outcome of the campaign or operation and the impact of the
activity on the accomplishment of military strategic or political objectives.
Operational commanders must know the capabilities of their tactical resources and
the tactical commander must understand the importance of a particular tactical
operation in the overall context.

3.01 Political decisions by the state’s highest authorities concerning military objectives
and engagement of the armed forces of the Slovak Republic must be made in
accordance with the competencies vested in the respective authorities by the
Constitution and other laws, taking into account the actual situation and the needs of
the state. They are described in the Military Strategy of the Slovak Republic and
other documents approved by the National Council and the Government of the
Slovak Republic. They are based on those principles, the application of which
enables the transformation of defense capacities and the capabilities of the armed
forces into the state’s fighting potential and their use to protect the vital interests and
to accomplish the strategic objectives of the state. These decisions and military
doctrines form a base for defense and operational planning.

**THE STATE’S FIGHTING POTENTIAL**

3.02 **Warfighting potential represents the capability and readiness of a state to wage war**
with the view of protecting its interests or fulfilling its international obligations. The
fighting potential consists of conceptual, physical, and moral element. The successful
use of the fighting potential depends on taking advantages brought by a real
situation.

3.03 **The conceptual element represents the spiritual dimension of the fighting potential**
expressed in the form of principles applied by the state in a war conflict or in
directing the activities of individual elements of the defense system, including the
armed forces.

3.04 **The physical element** encompasses all means for the conduct of war, including
personnel, economic and financial resources, technology and combat equipment,
logistic equipment, training and readiness for war. A part of the physical element is
also the combat power, which represents the fighting power and maneuverability of
available armed forces to resolve a particular situation at a given time in the theatre
of operations or at the battlefield.

3.05 **The moral element includes a set of motivating factors used to convince the people**
about the necessity of war engagement and self-sacrifice. It is an expression of the
spirit of the armed forces, of the quality of its control and command, of the level of
teamwork and of the immunity against psychological operations conducted by the
enemy.

3.06 **The situational element includes factors influencing the successful conduct of war**
operations by creating favorable internal and international conditions. These factors
range from geographic conditions, through the relation between combat powers, to
the ability of obtaining international support.

3.07 The political strategy of resolving a situation caused by a military threat will be a
purposeful combination of diplomatic, economic and military means. By applying
these means, the state will try to defend its intentions. In situations affecting the vital


-----

interests of the state, the decision on the character and extent of the use of the state’s
fighting power will be of key importance.

**THE ARMED FORCES AND THEIR COMBAT POWER**

3.08 The term “combat power“ refers to the ability of the armed forces to fight. It
consists, similarly to the state’s fighting potential, of the conceptual, moral, and
physical element.

Conceptual element

Moral element

Physical element

Figure 7 – Elements of the combat power

3.09 **The conceptual element of the combat power represents the ideological base and**
processes defining the ability to fight. It consists of the following basic components:
military strategic principles, doctrines at all levels, strategic and conceptual thinking.

3.10 **Military strategic principles.** The Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic observe
eleven military strategic principles, which are based on the military experience of the
whole mankind. These principles are: objective; initiative and surprise; mass;
economy of force; offensive, security; morale; flexibility; unity of command;
resource management and simplicity. The military strategic principles are not
dogmatic rules. Nevertheless, if any of them is unobserved, it may result in defeat in
a battle, operation or war. At the strategic and operational level, the military strategic
principles serve as the criteria for evaluating courses of action (COA).

3.11 **Doctrines. The purpose of doctrines is to define the framework for the conduct and**
planning of operations. Doctrines have their own hierarchy. They are authoritative,
but require judgment and creativity in application, depending on the situation.

3.12 **Strategic and conceptual thinking** refers to the need of creative approach in
preparing future conceptions, defining capabilities, estimating the requirements of
future operations in the changing strategic environment. The preparation of
conception for future operations has a deciding impact on the composition of the
armed forces and on the development of doctrines. In the case of smaller forces, the
availability and the balance between various services of the armed forces is more
important than their technological or numerous advantage. This principle is the basis
for the whole military strategy of the Slovak Republic. Similarly important are also
the quality of the human potential and the training of the armed forces, enabling the
small forces of the Slovak Republic to gain advantages in the actual and creative
application of strategic approaches depending on the particular situation. In the most

24


-----

possible scenarios considered, the strategy has to take into account also the limited
combat power.

3.13 **The moral element of the combat power** refers to the ability of leading
representatives of the society and of the commanders of the armed forces to convince
the people of the necessity to fight. The moral element is directly derived from good
training and strict discipline in the armed forces, from self-confidence and selfregard, from the reliability of equipment, proper administration and the respect
towards the command of the armed forces at all echelons, which should be based on
professional and moral qualities and the understanding of the situation and its
requirements. From the above requirements it follows that the moral element relies
especially on motivation, leadership and management.

3.14 A force under a proper command with the right motivation will achieve good
teamwork, based on fellowship and close interpersonal relationships. Unity and
**esprit de corps should be an expression of proud to belong to a closed circle of**
people. The quality of motivation then depends on the command at operational level
and is closely related to the maneuver warfare, which emphasizes the understanding
of the superior commander’s objectives and the so called principle of **mission**
**command.** To motivate troops in real multinational operations is more challenging
than in defending the homeland. Therefore, motivation is one of the primary tasks of
the operation commander.

3.15 **Leadership. Leadership generally refers to the ability of the commander to present**
such personal and character qualities, which can convince his subordinates to follow
his example and meet the operational requirements.

3.16 **Management refers to the optimum use of the assigned resources and represents one**
side of command. Nevertheless, it does not replace leadership. The basic
preconditions for good management are foresight, good planning, prioritization and
consistent integration of individual staffs within the headquarters.

3.17 **The physical component of the combat power refers to the means which could be**
used in combat. It also includes the total means of destructive and/or disruptive force
which a military unit/formation can apply against the opponent at a given time. The
physical element of the combat power includes: number of troops, equipment and
weapon systems, logistic equipment, training, operational capability (personal and
logistic capability, level of training). In connection with the planning, preparation
and conduct of operation, the physical component is often called **operational**
**capability.**

3.18 **Applying of combat power** includes the strategic context of war and other
conditions such as the terrain, geopolitics, propaganda, diplomacy, social situation,
historical context and any other component of the environment that influences the
outcome of war. The determination to fight, favorable environment (situation) or the
control over resources of key importance to the enemy might, under certain
conditions, influence the progress and the outcome of war. The current world
requires both the flexibility in creating favorable conditions for the accomplishment
of strategic objectives and the ability to prevent problems potentially caused by
improper analyses. The battlefield might be understood properly or improperly. If it

25


-----

is understood properly, it is possible to use the advantage it offers or to adopt it to the
requirements; in either case, it cannot be ignored. On the other hand, strategy might
be suitable for the given environment (situation) or unsuitable.

**PURPOSE, MISSION AND TASKS OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE SLOVAK**
**REPUBLIC**

3.19 **Purpose of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic is to defend the country**
against all military threats, contribute to the fulfillment of obligations arising out of
international treaties, and to provide support to civil authorities in confronting nonmilitary threats.

3.20 **Missions of the Armed Forces. In peacetime, in a crisis situation and in conflict the**
Armed Forces must be prepared to fulfill the following:

     - **to ensure plausible deterrence, and in case of its failure, to effectively ensure the**
**sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of the Slovak Republic**
and its allies against an external armed attack. They must be able to conduct such
operations both independently and as part of a coalition;

     - to take part in multinational peace building and peace support operations and
humanitarian operations under international supervision; and

     - to provide assistance to public authorities, either independently or as a member of
international organizations, in eliminating non-military threats and resolving crisis
situations.

3.26 **Tasks of the Armed Forces. Based upon a preliminary analysis, the Armed Forces**
must be prepared to successfully accomplish the following tasks in support of the
missions listed above:

     - **Maintain a High Readiness Force. These forces must be fully deployable in a**
relatively short period of time and be prepared to conduct the full range of combat
missions for the defense of the state, conflict prevention and peacekeeping and to
take part in the full range of operations under the command of international
organizations, subject to the terms and conditions of treaties binding on the
Slovak Republic, including treaties on common defense.

     - **Maintain forces at Lower Readiness. These Forces of Lower Readiness will be**
capable of conducting operations for the defense of the state, of taking part in
operations under the auspices of international organizations and, after admission
to NATO, they will be capable of fulfilling the obligations arising from Article V
of the Washington Treaty. This force must be capable of deployment/employment
for combat operations after a relatively longer period of time than required for the
High Readiness Force. In addition, they will provide sustainability, relief, or
reinforcement for the High Readiness Force.

     - **Maintain Long-Term Build-Up Forces that will be mobilized for the defense of**
the state and its allies, as required, in order to counter specific threats in
accordance with the expected warning and preparation time.

     - **Provide for the strategic functions of command, control, communications, early**
warning, military intelligence and reconnaissance.

     - **Provide for the continuous defense of the sovereignty of Slovak airspace and,**
after admission to NATO, for the protection of integrated NATO airspace. For
this purpose, they have to maintain appropriate air personnel and equipment.

26


-----

    - **Maintain the capability to receive allied reinforcements, under the appropriate**
circumstances, and to provide other Host Nation Support activities as may be
required.

    - **Be prepared to provide support to other ministries and government agencies,**
or local authorities, as requested by them and in accordance with the applicable
generally binding laws.

    - **Be prepared to rapidly provide, as a minimum, Special Forces and**
**intelligence assets to assist other agencies in the conduct of counter-terrorism**
operations.

    - **Maintain facilities and installations for training and** support to the deployed
forces.

    - **Maintain readiness and increased interoperability through participation in**
international exercises.

**COMPOSITION OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC**

3.27 The basic Services of the Armed Forces are the land forces, air forces and training
and support forces. Internally, the Armed Forces are broken down into associations,
formations, units, authorities and bases.

3.28 **The Land Forces** are characterized by high mobility, flexibility, sufficient firing
power and resistance against the use of enemy weapons. In accordance with the
military strategy, it ensures and defends the sovereignty and integrity of the Slovak
Republic, both in peacetime and during a war. They are structured, equipped and
dislocated in a manner enabling them to carry out independent land operations and to
participate in joint military operations together with the Air Forces or in
multinational military, humanitarian and peace support operations.

3.29 **The Air Forces are capable of defending the sovereignty of the Slovak airspace, of**
supporting the land forces and to carry out air transportation missions. In accordance
with the military strategy, it ensures and defends the sovereignty and integrity of the
Slovak Republic both in peacetime and during a war, cooperating closely with the
land forces. The Air Forces are structured, equipped and located in a manner
enabling them to carry out independent air operations and to participate in joint
military operations together with the Land Forces or in multinational military,
humanitarian and peace support operations. They maintain the capability of receiving
reinforcements from other nations and to provide them with appropriate host nation
support.

3.30 **Training and Support forces** provide basic and advanced individual training of
military personnel, ensure the preparation of non-commissioned officers, control the
logistics and the provision of logistic support to the Land Forces and the Air Forces
and ensure connections between the national defense control system and the strategic
and operational level of command of the Armed Forces. Training and Supporting
Forces consist of the Training Command, Logistics Command, Communications
Command with its units, Garrison Command of Bratislava and other training bases.

3.31 Military schools, military courts, military prosecutors, military intelligence service,
higher military administration offices, regional military administration offices and

27


-----

other organizations established by the Ministry of Defense participate in the
accomplishment of the above listed tasks of the armed forces.

**4. BASIC APPROACHES TO ENGAGEMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE**
**SLOVAK REPUBLIC**

4.01 This Doctrine of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic contains an overview of
the best practice applied in the Armed Forces and by their commanders, which
should be used in accomplishing their respective professional missions during the
engagement of the Armed Forces. It addresses the problems and shortcomings in the
previous development. It respects the uniqueness of each historical situation, which
is demonstrated among other things by the fact that successful courses of actions
applied in a particular situation might lead to complete failure under different
conditions, often as a consequence of dogmatic application of doctrinal principles of
warfare. Therefore flexibility has its place among military strategic principles as it
enables to use judgment and initiative and to exploit the opportunities presented by
particular circumstances and situations.

4.02 **The basic pillars of the Doctrine of** the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic are:
military strategic principles and maneuver approach to the conduct of military
operations. Other main attributes of the Doctrine include mission command,
acceptance of requirements for the conduct of joint and multinational (combined)
operations, pragmatic and flexible approach in the application of doctrines and
development of war spirit within the Armed Forces.

**MILITARY STRATEGIC PRINCIPLES**

4.03 Military strategic principles are based on historical experience from successful wars
and their application in a principal manner influences and directs all decisive
activities of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic. Their application must not be
regarded as a list of obligatory steps and they must not be understood independently
from each other. It is crucial to understand their mutual interactions and dependence.
Commander’s knowledge and creative applying of the military strategic principles
enables to decrease the risk of failure in the decision-making process by indicating
those procedures, which provide a higher guaranty of success.

4.04 **Selection and observance of objectives. Before an operation, proper selection and**
definition of the operation’s objective is of crucial importance. The purpose of this
procedure observing this principle is to support overall political objectives and to
direct operations to accomplishment of clearly defined and attainable military
objectives. The objective may be of absolute or limited character. After the objective
is defined, every effort must be focused on its accomplishment until the changed
situation does not necessitate a review of the objective. Each plan at the lower
echelon must be supportive of the intentions of higher levels of command and of the
political objectives of the state. For this reason, the government of the Slovak
Republic must clearly define its political objectives and each level of command must
know the requirements for the accomplishment of this paramount objective and how
it could contribute to these efforts.

4.05 **Initiative and surprise. The purpose of surprise is to lead an attack at such point of**
time and at such place, at which the enemy is unprepared. At the beginning of a war
campaign, the initiative and the factor of surprise is usually in the hands of the
aggressor. Since a surprising attack by an enemy might have a devastating effect on
the moral of own forces, the commander’s task is to take all measures required to
surprise the enemy and to prevent surprising enemy attacks. A surprising attack
usually causes disproportional effects from the viewpoint of efficient use of efforts.

4.06 **Concentration of Effort.** To achieve success in war, it is essential to concentrate
superior force to that of the enemy at the decisive time and place. This is the purpose
of this principle. Concentration of efforts does not necessarily imply a massing of
forces or material. It refers mostly to the concentration of capabilities, for example
gunfire. This principle does not prevent the dispersal of forces, for example with the
view of deceiving the enemy or avoiding confrontation to maintain the capability to
strike at the most suitable point of time. In other words, the term refers to the
concentration of efforts and capabilities onto the enemy’s weaknesses, with
disproportional impacts, minimum losses and efficient use of resources.

4.07 **Economy of Effort** is closely related to the concentration of effort principle. The
purpose of the economy effort principle is to use only the minimum combat power
required to accomplish primary combat tasks within the specified time. This
principle means that it is not necessary to be superior to enemy everywhere at any
cost. The economy of effort principle suggests that commanders must not waste the
limited resources available and must accomplish the mission with minimum
resources and means. In other words, there is a need to optimize the use of fighting
potential, to balance offensive and defensive measures and to allocate personnel and
material resources in a manner avoiding their inefficient use.

4.08 **Offensive approach.** The purpose of this principle is to gain, exploit and sustain
initiative and offensive with the view of maintaining freedom of action. Then attack
is the basic form of combat and a deciding means to attain clearly defined goals. In
wartime, both offensive and defensive operations are required. It is therefore
necessary to train offensive operations and defense against the beginning of an
aggression, with a transition from defense to attack. Only an offensive campaign may
lead to the deciding victory. The offensive spirit must be maintained also when
carrying out defensive operations.

4.09 **Security and Protection.** The purpose of security and protection is to prevent the
enemy from gaining unexpected advantage. Security results from measures taken by
the commander to protect his own forces. Security helps to gain freedom of action by
decreasing the vulnerability against hostile actions and surprising attacks. Increased
security might be achieved by planning and knowledge of the enemy strategy, tactics
and doctrines. Since risk is a natural component of military operations, the security
and protection principle requires reasonable risk management and not inappropriate
prudence. Protective measures help to maintain freedom of action.

4.10 **Maintenance of Morale.** The main mission of the armed forces still remains
preparation for war, victory in it and restoration of peace. War has destroying and
bloody character and represents the use of controlled violence by both enemy sides.
Killing, death and fear are typical elements of war. Every soldier of the Armed
Forces of the Slovak Republic must be ready to fight and die in any operations,
which will be approved by respective national authorities. Therefore, morale has
usually stronger influence on the success in war than the quality of the material
resources. This doctrine support development of combat spirit despite the fact that
probability of engagement of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic in operations
other than war is higher. Bravery and good command help to overcome fear. Morale
is a link holding the troops together, giving them their combat ability and spirit.
Good morale is a complex phenomenon and can only be achieved by clear
understanding of objectives, by training, discipline, rules of behavior, good
administration and, above all, by motivation and good command. Excellent
command might maintain good morale of the personnel even at very unfavorable
conditions. The most efficient factor contributing to good morale is success,
appraisal and personal example.

4.11 **Flexibility stands for the ability of reacting rapidly to changed conditions and new**
opportunities by reviewing plans and carrying out flexible maneuvers, as well as the
ability to apply new ways of thinking and new approaches to warfare. Flexibility
directly influences the speed of the decision making process. Flexibility depends on

30


-----

material resources and personal qualities, on the atmosphere of trust within the armed
forces, on the quality of organization, training and discipline, on staff organizational
and planning procedures, as well as on the right structure of theoretical knowledge of
personnel and their ability to apply such knowledge. Flexibility of small combat
power depends on the possibility of multifunctional use of equipment and on the
appropriate training of personnel. Flexibility is degraded by routine procedures,
dogmatic application of doctrinal documents and preconceived opinions.

4.12 **Unity of command.** Ensure unity of effort for every objective. Unity of command
means that all forces operate under a single commander, who has sufficient authority
to direct the deployed forces in support of their joint objective. Ideally, there are
synergies arising from the cooperation throughout the whole spectrum of the
deployed units. Unified effort is the decisive element of the unity of command.
Cooperation must be based on good administration, unified understanding of
operational capabilities and limitations of partner elements and, most importantly, on
the will to cooperate, on the quality of command and on the creation of esprit de
corps among the units and their individual elements.

4.13 **Purposeful and effective resource management.** Resource management refers to
the administration of joint operations, including personnel administration and
logistics, which enable their smooth conduct. Administration, in broader sense,
means the administration of all military issues, which are not directly related with the
tactics and strategy applied. It is the principle of purposeful and efficient use of
personnel, equipment and weapon systems in combat. The success and sustainability
in military operations depend on the proper and timely provision of services,
equipment and maintenance in such a manner that the other principles are not
sacrificed.

4.14 The term logistic administration refers to all activities that are related to the provision
of supplies and equipment required to carry out war. Logistics of the joint forces is a
critical aspect of joint operations administration. If we look at the history,
insufficient logistic support was often the cause of defeat or huge losses. Operation
plans prepared by commanders must take into account certain logistic limitations.
The term personnel administration refers to all activities needed to ensure human
potential for military operations. Some aspects of personnel administration have
critical impact on maintaining a high morale of personnel.

4.15 **Simplicity.** Avoid unnecessary complexity in organizing, preparing, planning and
conducting military operations. Simplicity contributes to the success of operations.
Streamlined plans and self-contained orders minimize the risk of misinterpretation
and complications; improve the level of understanding and plan accomplishment.
They lead superior commanders to issue simple and direct directives, plans, and
orders to use joint equipment, doctrines or operational, technical and tactical
procedures. In broader sense, the application of the simplicity principle enables the
freedom of action by subordinate staffs. Factors contributing to simplicity include
lucidity of plans of all types, purposeful organizational structures and unambiguously
defined relationships between commanders, with clearly defined competencies and
responsibilities of individual echelons and within the command and control
structures.

**MANEUVERIST APPROACH TO MILITARY OPERATIONS**

4.16 The purpose of maneuverist approach is to put an enemy into a disadvantageous
position by flexible using of our own fighting potential. Maneuver is movement of
forces or use of our capabilities to maintain our relative advantages usually in the use
of fire power. Effective maneuver warfare enables to keep an enemy in unbalanced
position and also to defend our own forces and capabilities.

4.17 Application of maneuver warfare means degradation of the integrity of the enemy
and his will to fight. As distinct from the coercion approach, the maneuverist
approach is characterized by the use of force against the weak points of the enemy by
combining the maneuver with the pace of operations in the whole conflict, with the
use of surprise. The key is to set such a pace of operations as to produce surprise and
to increase its effects by parallel attacks against several weak points of the enemy,
presenting him with a dilemma.

4.18 Maneuver warfare means the application of maneuver-like thinking in the conduct of
military operations and, at the same time, a military way of thinking. Maneuver
warfare requires dealing with new requirements on the way of thinking by
commanders and staffs, such as initiative, originality, courage to adopt new solutions
and ability to accept mistakes by subordinates. The application of this approach
enables to concentrate all efforts on the set objective, which is to defeat the enemy.
Unlike the coercive strategy, maneuver warfare tries to avoid places with strong
resistance and it concentrates on recommended areas with the least resistance, using
reconnaissance. The commander’s mission is to take every opportunity to carry out a
successful operation and therefore, maneuver warfare supports and requires
decentralization of command to the lowest level possible.

4.19 Maneuverist approach is applied at all levels of war. In comparison with other
strategies, maneuver warfare produces better results, with efficient use of efforts and
resources. It is the best strategy in a fight against an enemy superior in number and
equipment.


## Purposes of maneuverist approach at the operational level
 − to form theather of operation  − attack on enemy´s integrity  − to defend own force´s interity  − to exploit particular situations


Figure 9. Purposes of manoeuvrist approach at the operational level

4.20 Risk and risk management are natural elements of maneuver warfare. Maneuver
warfare is not suitable for prudent types of commanders. Maneuver warfare supports

32


-----

the use of indirect methods of strike. Fast decision-making cycle within the own
forces and disruption of the enemy’s decision-making cycle are of particular
importance for the successful application of maneuver warfare. Faster pace in
operations in maneuver warfare is achieved by entering the enemy’s decision-making
cycle (observation-orientation-decision-action cycle) in such a manner that our own
cycle is always one step ahead of the enemy’s cycle, paralyzing the enemy and his
ability to respond. These measures disrupt the integrity and the will of the enemy to
carry on operations and war. In principle, war is a process of risk control and war
victory is impossible without taking a risk. Maneuverist approach responds to this
challenge of war.

4.21 Maneuver warfare requires the use of planning and enemy assessment tools,
including the assessment of centers of gravity, decisive points and lines of
operations, which are, among other things, described in more detail in doctrine SVD30. The central point for the understanding maneuver warfare is to understand the
concept of centers of gravity.

4.22 Centers of gravity are those capabilities or elements from which a state, coalition,
interest group or military force derives its freedom of action, physical strength, or
will to fight. When evaluating centers of gravity, strengths, weaknesses and critical
vulnerabilities of both the enemy and own forces have to be considered. Centers of
gravity exist at all levels of war and, in fact, there could be more centers of gravity at
each level. The most vulnerable center of gravity is not always the one, which has
priority from the viewpoint of target acquisition. Defense of own centers of gravity
prevents defeat by enemy. Elimination of a properly defined enemy´s center of
gravity significantly weakens him and, eventually, causes his defeat. The art of
warfare requires concentration of efforts on critical weaknesses of the main source of
the enemy’s fighting power. Centers of gravity are often immaterial; it could be for
example the support of the public. Identification of centers of gravity is one of the
most important components of the situation estimate at each echelon.

4.23 **Basic military capabilities of the Armed Forces. Application of the fighting power**
and maneuver warfare requires certain basic defense capabilities of the Armed
Forces, which include:

    - **Command,** responsibility delegation procedures and the procedures for the
coordination, control and guiding of the Armed Forces, which must be sufficiently
resistible and be backed by sufficient reserves;

    - **Providing for information** according to requirements of command
authorities, what includes mastering of collation, processing, management and
dissemination assets;

    - **combat procedures and assets, including movement capability within the zone**
of operations, re-supply of the deployed forces and offensive, defensive,
maneuver and firing means;

    - **readiness of personnel to be deployed in the theater of operations on time and**
in balanced composition according to the set criteria of operational readiness;

    - **interoperability with the forces contributing to multinational military**
operations under the conduct of international organizations;

33


-----

    - the capability to **protect** and sustain fighting power in operations, including
the protection against the enemy, natural events and technological assets; and

    - the capability to sustain and support troops deployed in operations to maintain
the desired level of fighting power.

**Application of the mission command method.**

4.24 One of the deciding aspects of maneuverist approach to engagement of the Armed
Forces is a style of command called “mission command”. Mission command is based
on decentralized command concept that is characterized by assignment of objectiveoriented combat missions by the superior commander to a particular subordinate
commander. As distinct from authoritative command, the commander states “what”
needs to be achieved, he does not order, however, “how” to achieve it. This gives the
subordinate commanders the opportunity to use their own initiative within the
defined area, time and with the allocated resources, it provides freedom of action and
enables to streamline the decision making process. Deciding factors of successful
application of mission command are as follows:

    - the superior commander has to ensure that the subordinate commander
understands the objectives and intentions of the superior commander, his own
combat tasks and the strategic, operational and tactical context of the operation;

    - the subordinate commander is told what effect they are to achieve and the
reason why it is necessary;

    - the subordinate commander is allocated sufficient resources to accomplish his
combat task;

    - the superior commander will use authoritative measures to the least extent
necessary, giving the subordinate commander freedom of action; and

    - the decision on the best manner of how to accomplish the combat mission will
be in the hands of the subordinate commander.

4.25 **Pragmatic and flexible approach.** The necessary preconditions of maneuver
warfare are flexibility and pragmatic approach to the planning and conduct of
military operations. A successful commander must have qualities such as
imagination, innovative approach, non-conform way of thinking, initiative,
innovative thinking and other. The goal is to create an atmosphere within the Armed
Forces that would not appreciate dogmatism and mechanic application of rules.

**JOINT OPERATIONS**

4.26 The Land Forces, the Air Forces, and the Supporting Forces, as well as the special
forces can apply its specific characteristic and strengths in the conduct of operation.
Mostly none of these forces is capable of independent and full resolving of the estimated
conflicts. Each time more, the operations have joint and multinational character,
which generates more requirements on preparation and training.

4.27 Joint deployment of the Land Forces, the Air Forces and the Support Force in
military operations is now becoming a necessity and is one of the conditions required
to succeed. A broad range of activities requires not only a liaison between the
individual Services of the Armed Forces, but very often also close cooperation with

34


-----

the civil authorities and organizations. This also requires informing each other about
own capabilities and limitations, which must be respected.

4.28 Joint operations are operations conducted with the joint efforts of various military
elements (land force, air force, special force, support force) under a single command.
To accomplish strategic or operational tasks in advance defined joint area of
operation the joint forces are to be created. In military operations other than war,
joint operations will include joint engagement with civil organizations and their
forces and assets. To resolve the real military and other serious non-military threats
the Minister of Defense of the Slovak Republic establishes the **joint operation**
**command and appoints its commander.**

4.29 The Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic is in
command of the Joint Operation Forces through the commander of these forces. In
peacetime usually Chief of operation center acts as the Commander of Joint
Operation Forces or the Minister of Defense appoints other officer based on proposal
made by the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic.
The joint operation commander is responsible for planning and conducting the
operation. He is responsible to the Chief of the general Staff for deployment,
sustainment and re-deployment of the armed forces as well as for creation of the
Joint Operation Command. The commander of the joint operation is given operation
command (OPCOM) over deployed forces and the commander of operation
arrangement is given operation control (OPCON). When a real military threat occurs
the Chief of General Staff creates the Slovak Military Command Center to serve as
the join operation command.

4.30 During preparation and planning phase of a joint operation the Ministry of Defense
and the General Staff´s Departments are focusing on specifying military conditions
to achieve the end state, defining political, financial and legal limits of the use of the
armed forces in a particular operation. They define military strategic objectives to
accomplish political strategic intents and also resources and forces are earmarked for
these objectives, the operation zone is set up, the joint operation commander is
chosen and appointed, and command and control structure and mechanism for
a particular operation is determined.

4.31 The Chief of the General Staff the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic issues
military strategic directive through the joint operation commander. All main
authorities of the Ministry of Defense participate in development of this directive,
which provides the joint operation commander with the list of military strategic
objectives, instructions for carrying out the operation and resources to accomplish
the objectives.

4.32 In harmony with the directive the joint operation commander with his staff develop
the operation plan (OPLAN). For this he can exploit solutions contained in the
Standing Defense Plans and Contingency Operational Plans. During works on the
operation plan the commander uses the plan construction elements ensuring correct
procedure of the plan development. The plan constructions elements are based on
operational art and they are understood as planning tools which include: end state,
**center of gravity decisive point, line of operation, sequencing, phases, branches,**
**operational pause and culminating point. Plan preparations in detail are contained**
in doctrine SVD –30.

Figure 10. The elements of operational planning

4.33 The joint operation commander must be able to integrate characteristics of individual
force components in a such manner that synergetic effect and the most effective use
of their capabilities are ensured. In this respect the joint operation commander creates
appropriate organizational force structure.

4.34 Commanders of force components integrated into the joint operation forces are
responsible to the joint operation commander only. Based on their positions they
have the tactical command (TACOM) above earmarked troops.

4.35 Centralized planning and decentralized acting are basic principles of planning and
conducting of joint operations. Centralization of planning is based on the request of
unified and coordinated effort. Decentralized acting is conditioned by limited
commander´s abilities to control acting of a huge number of troops and individuals.
Control in detail could threaten course and results of operation. Decentralized acting
makes room for the commander and his staff to dedicate time to operational issues
and to not pay attention to tactical details of the operation. In this respect, the
precisely defined intent of the commander has a decisive importance in planning and
conducting of operation.

4.36 Integrated acting is the principle, which respond to keystone of joint operations.
Success in joint operations in a great extent depends on abilities to exploit complex
capabilities of all force components. The commander with his staff must deeply

36


-----

master capabilities of subordinate components. Effect of integrated acting, to the
certain extent, depends on ability to apply the control with active participation at the
joint operation command level and also to represent main parts and force
components in a balanced manner. For this purpose, liaison elements mastering
possibilities, strengths and weaknesses of represented force components, are
established. Liaison officer represents supporting commander and participate in
consultations used by the joint operation commander in order to achieve success in
operation.

**MULTINATIONAL OPERATIONS**

4.37 Due to the situation in the security environment, taking into account forthcoming
accession to NATO and previous experience with the deployment of the Armed
Forces of the Slovak Republic in recent years, it can hardly be expected that
operations to ensure national security and defense will be carried out exclusively by
the national forces. Most operations will take place in international environment
under multinational command.

4.38 The Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic must therefore be prepared to perform
their tasks in multinational operations. Based on a decision of political authorities,
the Slovak Republic allots its forces, which, in accordance with in advance agreed
conditions, are then placed under operation control (OPCON) or, in reasonable cases,
under operational command (OPCOM) by the multinational force commander of the
UN, OCSE, NATO or EU.

4.39 A decision on participation in multinational operation is influenced not only by effect
from national political and military point of view but also a contribution to
multinational operation is considered. Other aspects for making a decision on
involvement in such operations are: considering of advantages of multinational
cooperation, taking political risks, influence of taken action on situation development
within are of deployment and impact on public opinion. From military point of view,
it is necessary to take into account that multinational military operations, in decisive
way, deepen multinational relations among participating nations, provide with access
to combined military structures, logistic support, defense standardization, and
mediate exceptional information with its intelligence value.

4.40 Diplomatic and military steps ensuring effective acting of forces and assets placed to
multinational operations by the Slovak Republic are: decision on participation in
planning process of operation, delegating powers to commander of combined forces,
appointing the commander of operation with his responsibilities, the commander of
national contingent with his powers to subordinates (usually OPCON or OPCOM)
and responsibilities of supporting commanders.

4.41 Multinational (combined) military operations are military actions conducted by
forces of two or more nations. The cooperation of these forces is based either on
long-term alliance obligations or obligations arising out of short-term coalitions
formed for a specific purpose. Achieving the objectives of a multinational operation
is based on a joint doctrine and the ability of the multinational force to cooperate
efficiently. Multinational operations require mutual respect among the participating
forces and division of tasks adequately to their capabilities. Other requirements

37


-----

include a compatible communication system, flexible national and multinational
logistic support and cooperation in the performance of joint tasks.

4.42 For creation of multinational forces, command and control relations, planning and
conducting of multinational operations the same or comparable principles as for joint
operations are applied. Experience obtained from previous multinational operations
confirm, that creative and initiative applying of these principles enables to resolve
difficulties brought by multinational environment and to achieve military efficiency
and success in these operations.

4.43 Multinational operations are usually conducted as joint operations, under the
participation of forces of two or more nations. To prepare and conduct an operation,
multinational staffs at strategic and operational levels are created, with the task of
accomplishing the set objectives of the operation. The command of the joint force
might be composed of representatives of the participating forces, pro rata according
to their military contribution to the operation. The joint task force commander has
the authority to command the multinational forces, to coordinate their activities and
to concentrate their efforts, in order to achieve operation objectives.

4.44 **Unity of command in multinational operations is achieved by delegating powers to a**
single commander to control and coordinate acting of military forces and assets. The
roles and amount of contributing forces to the multinational contingent structure have
a significant impact on a decision on delegating powers to the multinational forces
commander. Delegating powers of operation control (OPCON) above forces and
assets placed to a multinational contingent to the commander of the contingent
fulfills a minimal request to ensure unity of command.

4.45 **Continuity of command enforces unity of command during operation. Continuity of**
command refers to links between planning and conducting of operations, chain of
command, and creation of reserve commands in case of necessity.

4.46 **Command** integration ensures an effective use of earmarked forces and assets to
support objectives of multinational operation. It enables to integrate national
elements to the command structure and so enforces transparency of chain of
command.

4.47 **Decentralized** acting, similarly to joint operations, enables to multinational
operation commander to delegate powers and responsibilities to his subordinates so
that they will support objectives and plans of superior commander. Decentralization
gives a freedom to act purposefully when unexpected situations occur and to exploit
favourable opportunities. This way their initiative is supported and their decision
making process is accelerated. The powers, based on decentralization, force
subordinate commanders to develop their own plans, to define objectives and to
provide their units with resources and competencies to fulfill their tasks.

4.48 **Cooperation and mutual understanding help to recognize strengths and weaknesses**
of operation participants and offer a necessary source of requested trust among them
during all phases of operation, beginning by operation planning and finishing by redeployment. An important base of cooperation is using joint doctrines and
exploitation of multinational training and exercises. To enforce interoperability and

38


-----

so-called compatibility in minds it is necessary to use multinational training to the
maximal extent.

4.49 Particular questions concerning participation of the Armed Forces of the Slovak
Republic in multinational operations are to be contained in an independent doctrine
based on doctrine SVD 30.

## 55.. MMIILLIITTAARRYY OOPPEERRAATTIIOONNSS OOTTHHEERR TTHHAANN WWAARR

5.01 Military Operations Other Than War (MOOTW) are operations that encompass the
use of military capabilities across the range of military operations short of war. They
include operations with or without the use or threat of military power. Military
operations other than war include in particular: peace support operations,
humanitarian operations, counterterrorism, and operations to mitigate the effects of
criminal and terrorist acts, support to operations of public authorities, assistance to
aircraft in emergency and others.

**PRINCIPLES OF CONDUCTING MILITARY OPERATIONS OTHER THAN WAR**

5.02 The principles of conducting military operations other than war include in particular:

    - **The transparency and credibility principle,** which defines the need for the
setting of clear objectives. It enables to gain the support of the majority of own
population and the host nation support in the case of a deployment of the Armed
Forces of the Slovak Republic outside our national territory. Application of this
principle prevents misinterpretation of the mission of the peace forces, helps to
understand the motifs, intentions and objectives of their engagement and
supports dialogue with the public. Strict observance of the set rules for the
engagement of forces, impartiality, professional behavior and appearance and
strict discipline within the forces increase the trust and belief into a fair and
impartial mission of the forces in a peace operation.

    - **Restraint by international law sets forth that military force should be used only**
to the extent necessary and adequately to the given situation. The rules for the
use of force agreed for international peace forces are the main guaranty for the
observance of this principle. The competencies of the commander in providing
assistance to state and local authorities are set by the Minister of Defense of the
Slovak Republic pursuant to Act No. 321/2002 Coll. on the Armed Forces.

    - **The impartiality of peace force principle** is important to ensure cooperation
with all parties involved in the military conflict and to gain their trust.
Commanders must bear in mind that their impartiality will constantly be in the
focus of attention not only of the parties involved in the conflict, but also of the
local population and the media. In situations, when impartiality can not be
maintained, commanders proceed in accordance with the applicable political
decisions. The highest probability of occurrence of such situations is in peace
enforcement and sanction enforcement operations pursuant to Chapter VII of the
UN Charter.

    - **The freedom of movement principle enables the armed forces free movement**
within the area of operations in accordance with their respective tasks. The right
of free movement is set forth in their mandate. During an operation, commanders
may enforce this right even with the threat of violence in accordance with the
rules for the use of power for the given operation.

    - **The civil-military cooperation principle** has a direct impact on the civil
population and infrastructure. The use of military power in civil areas causes
many limitations. Taking up and maintaining cooperation with the civil
population, state institutions and non-state organizations is the key to the success
of a non-military operation. Civil-military cooperation (CIMIC) is of key


-----

importance and is organized for two reasons – to get moral and material support
from local authorities and population and to ensure accomplishment of the nonmilitary operation mission.

5.03 In an engagement in operations other than war, the rules of engagement (ROE) have
to be followed, which are binding also for forces under national command taking part
in the given operations. These rules are based on the Geneva Convention,
supplementary protocols and the Hague Conventions, setting the limits for the extent
and manner of engagement. These rules require the use of military power in an
adequate manner with respect to the importance of the set military objectives with
the view of minimizing personnel and material losses; in operations other than war,
commanders are entitled to use such power in self-defense, as is necessary to protect
human lives. Such self-defensive measures must be appropriate, must respond
directly to the threat and must not have the character of a response action.

**PEACE SUPPORT OPERATIONS**

5.04 Military operations other than war, in which the Armed Forces of the Slovak
Republic might participate, include in particular multinational peace support
operations (PSOs). The purpose of peace support operations under the command of
international organizations is to support political decisions and other measures taken
with the view to prevent an international or national armed conflict, most often
caused by disputes among ethnical or religious communities and societal groups, to
enforce and sustain peace in cases, when the conflict could not have been prevented,
to mitigate the consequences of the conflict and to provide support to political,
humanitarian and social measures carried out by civil authorities as part of the postconflict consolidation of the affected area.

5.05 In the course of such operations, the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic might be
used to stop the military confrontation, to separate the disputing parties, to stabilize
the situation and to create the conditions for more efficient use of the combination of
political, economic and military tools with the view to overcome conflicts and crisis
situations.

5.06 Efforts to solve a situation peacefully and to restore peace and security are headed by
the UN Security Council. It might pass its mandate to an international organization,
which has sufficient diplomatic, economic and military means, international support
and influence on the representatives of parties involved in the conflict. Other
international communities may pass a decision to participate in such operations and
to make their own military contributions.

5.07 When classifying operations to sustain or support international peace and security,
both the diplomatic and military viewpoint have to be taken into account. From the
diplomatic viewpoint, there is a stage in the activity of the international community,
in which there is a chance to prevent the conflict by diplomatic means. The use of
diplomacy in this stage might be supported by military operations to avert the
conflict or by peace building operations. Such operations are carried out with the
consent of the opposing parties with the view of preventing a conflict or sustaining
peace.

5.08 If attempts to prevent the armed conflict fail and the participating parties do not find
a peaceful solution, diplomatic measures are used to for international solidarity
required for the use of other means to enforce peace without the express consent of
the opposing parties. The objective of peace enforcement operations is to force the
participating parties to end the conflict and to achieve a peace treaty. These
operations are carried out based on a resolution of the UN Security Council in
accordance with chapter VII of the UN Charter.

**MEASURES TO COUNTER INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM**

5.09 For international security, terrorist activities by individuals or organized groups and
international networks are particularly threatening. Due to the rise in terrorist
activities, the armed forces must be prepared to provide military support to the public
authorities or to assume full responsibility in the fight against terrorism. Close links
between terrorism and organized crime, illegal drugs trafficking, money laundering,
illegal spreading, owning and using nuclear, chemical, biological and other
potentially lethal materials requires cooperation of security elements at both national
and international level. Particularly threatening to the security of the state and to
international security is ownership of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) by
terrorist groups.

5.10 Experience gained after the terrorist attacks on the U.S. on September 11, 2001 and
the following military operation conducted by the counter-terrorism coalition
confirmed that efficient measures by governments and international organizations are
required to prevent terrorist activities, suppress existence of terrorist groups and
restrict their financing with full use of intelligence, justice and military authorities at
national and international level.

5.11 The increase of terrorist activities in international environment represents an
important phenomenon influencing the further development in the security
environment of the Slovak Republic. The armed forces must be prepared and able to
counter terrorism. This requires training of special counter terrorism units and
intelligence elements.

42


-----

5.12 Engagement of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic within antiterrorist
measures and the use of this doctrine for operational purposes are based on this
definition of terrorism: “Terrorism is well-thought-out and premeditated using of
violence or threat of unlawful violence to spread fear intended to coerce or intimidate
governments or whole societies by attacking civil targets in the pursuit of goals that
are generally political.” Terrorism is based on using of violence against civilians and
civil objects aiming to achieve political objectives.

5.13 Within counter terrorism, it is possible to use the armed forces in two types of
operations:
− **Defensive counter terrorism measures which are based on collection of**
intelligence information, revealing, prevention and elimination of terrorist
plans to attack, and include measures to decrease vulnerability of individuals
and various facilities to terrorist attacks
− **Offensive counter terrorism measures which include prevention, discourage**
and response to terrorist attacks or planned attacks, and also include collection
of intelligence information and analysis of possible threats.

5.14 In accordance with missions of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic, defensive
counter terrorism measures will consist of activities to protect people and facilities
from terrorist attacks. Apart from others this includes identification of weaknesses of
the protection systems, obtaining of intelligence information, monitoring of
important facilities with high vulnerability and other objects. The Armed Forces of
the Slovak Republic may provide protection units and security agencies with
advisory on selected capabilities and to recommend how to decrease vulnerability of
chosen facilities to terrorist attacks.

5.15 Offensive counter terrorism measures will consist of revealing of terrorist intents,
preventive strikes and response to terrorist attacks in cooperation with intelligence
and police components. Primarily, the special units will be integrated to operations as
monitoring of suspicious facilities, obtaining of important documents from terrorist
organizations, strikes against terrorist structures, releasing of hostages, re-acquiring
of facilities taken by terrorists and so on.

5.16 Detailed involvement of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic in counter
terrorism will be contained in the Guide for counter terrorism issued by Minister of
Defense.

**HUMANITARIAN OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT OF CIVIL AUTHORITIES**

6.12 Humanitarian operations, assistance in catastrophes, search and rescue, evacuation of
civil population, assistance and support provided by the armed forces to civil
authorities in a state of emergency or other extraordinary situations may be regarded
as non-military operations. They are operations carried out under the participation of
the armed forces with the view of providing assistance to the civil population and
civil authorities in a response to crisis situations caused by non-military threats, such
as natural events, large-scale accidents or civil disorders, which place a threat to
human lives, possessions and cultural values or disturb the civil order, if the forces
and assets of the competent authorities are not sufficient to resolve such situations.

43


-----

6.13 To resolve such situations and in accordance with the valid legislation and decisions
issued by state authorities, the armed forces assign, either independently or in
cooperation with other authorities and elements forming a part of the national
security system, forces and assets required to carry out rescue, search and supporting
works, to protect the civil order, to guard national borders, routes of movement,
facilities and installations, to protect public possessions and to supplement rescue,
medical, supply and transportation services provided by civil authorities. Such forces
and assets may assist to the authorities of the Ministry of Interior or may be
integrated into the civil rescue system.

6.01 **Philosophy of command. The philosophy of command in maneuver warfare is based**
on mission command (explained in other sections of this doctrine). Mission
command is applied at all levels of command, from strategic to tactical. A
precondition for the application of this philosophy is delegation of competencies to
those levels of command, which are able to use them in the most efficient manner.

6.02 **Means of command.** Efficient command requires two basic means: efficient
communication and solid doctrines. Efficient communication in the era of powerful
communication technologies providing a detailed overview of situation in the theatre
of operations might lead the superior echelons to the application of micromanagement at lower echelons. Efficient conduct of operations requires initiative by
subordinates. The deeply embedded strategy of buck-passing and passive waiting for
orders contradicts sharply with maneuver warfare. Complexity of the current
operations requires a certain level of coordination of activities and the art of military
command is to find the right balance between guidance and delegation of
competencies in the command and control system. Orders by superior commanders
might be necessary especially in situations, in which tactical activities might have
serious strategic consequences. The basic preconditions for the application of
mission command is mutual trust between subordinates and their superior
commanders, and acceptance of mistakes done by subordinates.

6.03 **Plans. Commanders at all echelons have to guide their activities according to the**
prepared plans, approved by their superior commanders. Such plans have to contain
the required objectives, the ways of achieving such intentions and the necessary
assets. A plan represents the ideas of the commander how to accomplish combat
tasks ordered by superior commanders, using the assigned resources. The plan should
also contain combat and other tasks of subordinates and allocation of the respective
resources so that they are able to prepare their own plans of how to accomplish the
set objectives.

6.04 **Directives. Detailed data on the contents of planning documents in the conduct of**
joint operations are contained in doctrine SVD-30. At the military strategic level, the
Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces issues plans in the form of planning
and other directives.

44


-----

6.05 **Ends, ways and means.** A commander has to consider all factors in the situation
estimate process. The whole complex of planning processes, planning authorities,
their responsibilities and the contents of the long-term planning documents are
described in doctrine SVD-50. The relationships between ends, ways and means of a
plan and the understanding of these basic terms are of crucial importance for the
planning process.

6.06 **Ends. The paramount task of the planning process is to specify a clear and illegible**
objective in accordance with the basic strategic principle of objective. Changed
situation in a conflict may require a flexible response and a review of the objective at
various echelons. In this regard, the plan becomes a means to change the objective.

6.07 **Ways. Based on the objective, the commander prepares a plan, which will contain**
the best way of how to apply the basic defense capabilities described at a different
place in this doctrine to be able to use the available fighting power. The commanders
must know the capabilities of their available units and the preconditions for their use
and must be prepared for changes in situation and various alternatives by answering
the question how they could best accomplish the set objectives.

6.08 **Forces and capabilities. The commander has the means required to accomplish the**
set objective in the form of allotted units and capabilities. If the allotted units are not
sufficient to accomplish the combat task, the commander may ask for further
capabilities or he may evaluate the risks involved in accomplishing the objectives
with the allotted forces by considering their capabilities.

**REQUIREMENTS ON COMMANDER´S ABILITIES AND CAPABILITIES**

6.09 Historically, several features of successful command proved to be essential. One of
the key features is strong leadership at all echelons. Successful leaders did not
subdue to the circumstances; instead they used the arising opportunities to advance
their objectives. Successful commanders had a number of personal qualities, from
which the deciding characteristics may be derived.

6.10 **Commander’s characteristics. Commander must be open-minded towards various**
alternatives and must have the ability to identify the core of a problem. Commanders
must remain calm and keep a cool head in a crisis situation and must show courage
to resist psychological pressure under unfavorable circumstances. Commanders must
be able to formulate what they want to achieve and why they want to achieve it.
Commanders must be ready to use their authority and to act in a situation requiring
action. Commanders must be able to convince and motivate subordinates to fulfill
often very difficult decisions. Modern understanding of discipline is based on
cooperation and team atmosphere. Commanders must be able to direct their teams in
the right direction. Characteristics of an efficient commander are described in more
detail in doctrine SVD-30.

**CONTROL AND COMMAND STATUTES**

6.11 Command is the authority exercised by a commander in the Armed Forces to fulfill
his will and intents towards to subordinates with aim to set a particular procedure. In
includes competencies and responsibilities for assigning and engagement of forces to
accomplish their tasks. The Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic use command
statutes and standards in accordance with NATO definitions.

6.12 **Full command. The military authority and responsibility of a commander to issue**
orders to subordinates. It covers every aspect of military operations and
administration. In international operations, full command is the exclusive
responsibility of the contributing nation and cannot be delegated.

6.13 **Operational command. The authority granted to a commander to assign missions or**
tasks to subordinate commanders, to deploy units, to reassign forces and to retain or
delegate operational and/or tactical control as the commander deems necessary.
Operational command does not include responsibility for administration or logistic
support.

6.14 **Tactical** **command. The authority delegated to a commander to assign tasks to**
forces under his command for the accomplishment of the mission assigned by higher
authority.

6.15 **Control.** That authority exercised by a commander over part of the activities of
subordinate organizations, or other organizations not normally under his command,
which encompasses the responsibility for implementing orders or directives. By this
authority, a commander with his staff, organizes, controls and coordinates activities
assigned forces.

6.16 **Operational control. The authority delegated to a commander to direct forces**
assigned so that the commander may accomplish **specific missions** or tasks which
are usually limited by function, time, or location; to deploy units concerned, and to
retain or assign tactical control of those units. It does not include authority to assign
separate employment of components of the units concerned. Neither does it, of itself,
include administrative or logistic control.

6.17 **Tactical** **control. The detailed and, usually, local direction and control of**
movements or maneuvers necessary to accomplish missions or tasks assigned.

6.18 **Administrative control. Direction or exercise of authority over subordinate or other**
organizations in respect to administrative matters such as personnel management,
supply, services, and other matters not included in the operational missions of the
subordinate or other organizations.

6.19 Command authorities and structure of joint operations and crisis management is
defined in doctrine SVD-30.
