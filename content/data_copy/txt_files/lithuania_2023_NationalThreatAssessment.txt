**FOREWORD**

Dear readers,

Russia’s war against Ukraine has presented a challenge to our intelligence community, on the other hand, it has had a sobering effect on how threats and security challenges that the whole of Europe is currently facing are perceived. It is more obvious
than ever that Russia and its decision to use military force is the biggest threat to
Lithuanian and European security alongside complicit actions by the authoritarian
and Russia-dependent Belarus.

The intelligence community had warned decision-makers about the impending Russian aggression before it started on 24 February last year and ever since has been
keeping them up to date about the developments in the ongoing conflict. Lithuania, a
close friend and staunch supporter of Ukraine, not only worked tirelessly to highlight
the importance of support to Ukraine but through the intelligence cooperation with its
allies helped to enhance the perception of long-term threats emanating from Russia.


-----

After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Lithuania and other Western states took additional
actions to reduce the activity of Russian and Belarusian intelligence services in their
own countries. Yet, we responsibly reiterate that dangers of provocation and recruitment of our or Western citizens visiting these hostile states have rather increased
than disappeared.

It is pleasant to note that Lithuanian society shows resilience to hostile propaganda,
though Russia still attempts to exploit pro-Kremlin individuals in Lithuania for its
own benefits. The cooperation of intelligence, law enforcement, and other competent institutions together with the civil society in curbing malicious activity remains
particularly important.

In the times of uncertainty, the public domain is filled with abundance of information –
objective knowledge and conspiracy theories, reasonable discussions and deceptive


-----

fiction along with attempts to manipulate. Nevertheless, discussion is a feature of a
healthy society, so it should be respected and protected as well as other fundamental
rights and freedoms.

The Lithuanian intelligence community provides decision-makers with information
about societal, political, business, energy, diplomatic, scientific, and other processes in
the country and international environment together with assessments on how it impacts
Lithuania’s national security. This National Threat Assessment is an unclassified version of our analytical insights on the security tendencies in the region and the world.

We appreciate your attention and hope that this document, prepared and presented
by the State Security Department and the Defence Intelligence and Security Service
under the Ministry of National Defence, will broaden your understanding and knowledge on the main questions of national security.

##### SUMMARY

 **Russia wages the war against Ukraine and turns into a totalitarian state. The**
war helps to reinforce Vladimir Putin’s personal power; it provides a pretext to repress
political opposition and tests the loyalty of the elites and security forces. Aggression
against Ukraine has exposed the regime’s inefficiency and corruption, lack of potential
to secure its economic development. Although the Western sanctions have not led
to a collapse of the economy, the problems are building up gradually. Russia is capable of continuing the war and maintaining social control through political repression
in the short term. However, the war requires mobilisation of state resources, which
undermines political and economic foundations of the regime.

 **Despite losses in Ukraine, Russia aims to strengthen the potential of its**
**Armed Forces. The regime is preparing for a long-term conflict with Ukraine and**
the West – it increases the size of its army and defence spending. The sanctions that
weaken Russia’s economy will not impede the regime’s ability to prioritise the funding
of increased military needs at the expense of public welfare. Nevertheless, the war
against Ukraine will diminish the Russian military threat in the Baltic Sea Region only
temporarily. Russia will prioritise efforts to replenish and strengthen the regional
military grouping as quickly as possible, but the speed and success of this process
will heavily depend on the duration of the war and the losses incurred in Ukraine.


-----

 **Belarus’ participation in the war against Ukraine worsens the region’s secu-**
**rity situation. Belarus has not only provided Russia with the ability to use its territory**
for offensive operations against Ukraine but also allows deploying the contingent of
the Russian Armed Forces. This has a negative effect on the security of Lithuania
and other NATO members – in case of conflict with the West, Russia would enjoy
unlimited access to Belarus’ territory and military support. Alyaksandr Lukashenka
hopes that Russian financial support will help to mitigate the impact of international
sanctions; however, Moscow’s failures in Ukraine and growing economic losses due
to Western sanctions highly likely will diminish the Kremlin’s financial capacity to
support the Lukashenka regime.

 **Xi Jinping begins his term with internal tensions rising and China’s foreign**
**policy becoming more assertive. Xi has secured unlimited power and eliminated**
political rivals, but emerging public dissatisfaction challenges the regime and forces
Chinese authorities to strengthen the security apparatus. China demonstrates that it
is prepared to cross a red line in its relations with Taiwan. Although military invasion is
unlikely, China’s aggression towards Taiwan will increase. Beijing supports Russia in
the information and diplomatic domains, helps to mitigate the impact of the sanctions.
In the near and medium term, Chinese–Russian cooperation will intensify; however,
the relations will become increasingly one-sided.


-----

 **The war in Ukraine and international sanctions have a negative impact on**
**Russia’s intelligence gathering capabilities. As European states expelled Rus-**
sian intelligence officers under diplomatic cover, the intensity of human intelligence
operations by Russian intelligence services in Europe and Lithuania has decreased.
This will force Russian services to resort to other information gathering methods and
search for new intelligence opportunities. Although Russia’s intelligence dedicates
most of its focus and resources to activity in and against Ukraine, Lithuanian citizens
visiting border areas with Russia or crossing the Lithuanian–Russian border are at
risk of becoming targets for Russian intelligence.

 **Facing challenges due to international sanctions, Russia is searching for**
**ways to bypass them. Russia’s priority – supply of Western goods and technologies**
that can be used in military industry. The most common methods to bypass sanctions
regime are concealing the true purpose of the goods and the end-users with a help of
a long chain of intermediaries. Attempts to circumvent the sanctions involve searching
for EU-based intermediary companies.

 **The terrorism threat in Lithuania remains low; however, lone radicalised**
**individuals pose a risk. International terrorist organisations have lost capability to**
organise new terrorist attacks in Europe; attacks are planned and perpetrated by
radicalised individuals who have no direct associations with terrorist organisations.
Migration route via Belarus has become one of the routes to enter the EU illegally.
Belarusian border guard officers, along with human traffickers and smugglers,
facilitate illegal migration.

##### RUSSIA

�Russia under Vladimir Putin becomes increasingly totalitarian;
however, the war erodes the regime’s political and economic
foundations.

�The coalition of allies the Kremlin is trying to build is united
solely around the idea of hostility towards the West. Belarus
remains the only ally that openly supports the aggression against
Ukraine. The dependence of other post-Soviet allies does not
guarantee their loyalty to Moscow on key foreign policy issues.

�The Kremlin sticks to its aims in Ukraine and, regardless of
losses, is prepared to continue the war for the duration of this
year and mobilise all the resources of the state.


-----

**Putin’s decision to go to war with Ukraine evokes**
**totalitarianism in Russia**

The restoration of Russia’s power, similar to that the Soviet Union or Russian Empire
once had, is Putin’s long-term vision. Yet, the attempt to achieve Russia’s greatness
through the war against Ukraine has led to growing political repression, militarisation,
and incoherent attempts to construct an ideology that supports the regime’s policies.

The war helps to reinforce Putin’s personal power and test loyalty of the elites; it also
provides an excuse to repress those who openly resist the government’s policies.

-----

Increased international isolation limits the spread of liberal Western ideas in Russian
society, which the regime considers to be among the main threats to its stability.
During one year of the war, the Kremlin finally eliminated independent media and
non-governmental organisations. Most members of the political opposition as well
as liberal intelligentsia voluntarily or forcibly have left Russia.

The war has exposed the inefficiency and corruption of the regime, revealed limits of
Russia’s military power and lack of potential to secure its economic and technological
development. Its dependence on energy export has increased; however, there is no
alternative to such an economic model. The regime hopes to redirect trade towards
‘friendly’ countries; meanwhile, Russia buys irreplaceable goods and technologies from
the ‘unfriendly’ West by circumventing the imposed sanctions. They have not led to a
collapse of the economy, but Russia’s economic problems, for example, dependence
on raw material exports, inefficient logistics, declining production due to shortages
of components and technology, and substantial budget deficit have been building up
steadily and are likely to continue to do so in the short term.

The majority of Russian population has been passively supporting the war, but the
mobilisation has revealed that this support is not so strong as the regime’s propaganda has been trying to portray. Dissatisfaction with the regime’s policies is currently
passive and manifests itself in mobilisation evasion or complaints about poor supply
and disorder in the Armed Forces. Russian society has started losing its confidence
in propaganda and the number of supporters of peace talks is growing. With the
economic situation deteriorating, dissatisfaction with the Kremlin’s policies is likely to
increase in the near term. The regime seeks to avoid such a situation, tries gradually to
accustom Russian society to realities of the war by employing the rhetoric on ‘special
military operation’, ‘partial’ and ‘limited’ mobilisation, and imposing martial law only
on part of Russian territory.

The ruling elite and security forces remain loyal to the regime and its policies. They
obey orders unquestioningly and support the regime with public militant rhetoric. Private businesses support the mobilisation and donate to the Armed Forces. It is likely
that the loyalty is driven by the fear of reprisals, conformity, and lack of an alternative
to Putin. Most of Russia’s top officials were forced to accept the new reality because
they had no prior knowledge of the decision to start the war against Ukraine. Putin
avoids replacing officials even when the war clearly reveals their incompetence. It is
likely that currently he tries to avoid creating additional stress for the elite.

-----

There are tensions and anxiety about the future among government officials and
representatives of large companies. Former practices of the regime, such as imitation
of democratic procedures, competition among Kremlin factions, oligarchs’ corrupt
activities in Russia and abroad, will have to cease due to the regime’s increasing
totalitarian tendencies and state control over the economy.

We assess that Russia’s ruling regime is capable of continuing the war and maintaining
social control through political repression in the short term. This strategy requires
mobilisation of state resources, which undermines political and economic foundations of the regime. It is possible that failures on the battlefield, further mobilisation,
and a sharp deterioration of the economic situation will have a negative impact on
the regime’s stability. In the current social and political environment, the most likely
alternative to the Putin’s regime is another authoritarian regime, so Russia likely will
remain a threat and source of instability in the region at least in the medium term.

**Russia expects closer economic ties with the CIS**
**countries in the short term**

Maintaining its influence in the post-Soviet region is one of the main Russia’s foreign
policy goals. Even though the war against Ukraine is the Kremlin’s immediate priority,
Russia plans to strengthen the integration of the Commonwealth of Independent
States and the Eurasian Economic Union and further develop the Union State project.

The regime of Alyaksandr Lukashenka, which openly supports Russia’s aggression
against Ukraine, is dependent on Russia. Other post-Soviet countries question the
Kremlin’s motives to start the war and show their dissatisfaction with its policies.
However, Russia’s initiatives to redirect international trade and logistics, to set up
mechanisms for sanction circumvention and financial settlement are economically
beneficial to countries in the South Caucasus and Central Asia. Russia plans to
increase their dependence through economic cooperation and investment projects
in the hope that this will limit their relations with the West and promote political
integration with Russia in the future.

Russia continues to pursue its traditional policy of direct interference in internal affairs
of post-Soviet states. In Moldova, Georgia, and Armenia, Russia supports pro-Kremlin
political parties and organisations and anticipates their accession to power through
elections. The conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Transnistria,
and Gagauzia are also being exploited. As long as Russian resources are primarily
directed at the war against Ukraine, active escalation of these conflicts and increased
military pressure on post-Soviet countries are unlikely in the short term.

**Russia aims to outsuffer Ukraine and the West**
**in a protracted conflict**

More than a year after the start of invasion of Ukraine, Russia is yet to achieve any of
the strategic objectives but continues to pursue them. The initial plan to overwhelm
Kyiv in a victorious blitzkrieg did not work out, so Russia resorted to additional measures – announced mobilisation and introduced martial law in certain areas, while the
country’s economy, state apparatus, and society are being gradually subordinated
to the war effort.

Although unable to gain advantage, Russia – or, namely, president Putin – wants to
keep on waging war and pushes the false narrative that the West is to blame for the
conflict. Russia is not willing to give up its strategic goal to destroy Ukraine’s sovereignty, and therefore, refuses any options for constructive dialogue and a diplomatic
solution to the conflict.

Mobilisation efforts allow Russia to replenish its battlefield losses and assign personnel
to newly created units on the frontline. Political-military leadership has announced a
serious increase in the size of the Armed Forces: in 2023, it is to surpass 2 million and

will continue to grow in the future. In December 2022, Russia’s Ministry of Defence
announced a plan to change its force posture in the Western strategic direction by
introducing a large-scale reform in the Armed Forces. Minister Sergey Shoigu declared
ambitions to expand the Armed Forces by additional 350,000 troops. According to
the plan, three new motor rifle divisions will be established and seven brigades will
be enlarged to division size units, roughly tripling their size. It is assessed that these
and other reforms would increase the number of military personnel, armament, and
combat equipment units in the Western Military District by 30 to 50 percent. As these
changes are envisioned in the long term, they will not affect the current combat actions
in Ukraine. In addition, Shoigu announced plans to stage strategic military exercise
Zapad in 2023 – two years ahead of schedule. This shows that Russia is adapting
its Armed Forces to be better fit for an extended confrontation with the West and
intensifying its regional deterrence efforts due to anticipated Swedish and Finnish
membership in NATO. Russia does not give up its aims to continue increasing military
capabilities despite losses incurred in Ukraine.

Russia is likely preparing itself for a protracted conflict, no matter what the cost.
Defence spending is prioritised over all the other budget expenditures necessary
to solve mounting domestic problems. Even under sanctions, Russia increased the
official war spending by 30 percent last year. In 2023, the cost is estimated to reach
five trillion roubles (66 billion euros), in fact, with all secret allocations the cost of war
is assessed to be much higher.

The sanctions have starved the Russian military industry of foreign electronic components needed to produce, modernize, or repair sophisticated equipment such as
missiles or armour. Even lack of more basic parts is becoming a limiting factor, since
Russia has already turned to its small group of foreign supporters (Iran, North Korea,
or China) to ask for ammunitions but with varying degrees of success.

In order to escape growing isolation, Russia has been looking for alternative partners,
but this search has had limited success so far. Countries that are willing to continue
buying energy resources from Russia, such as China, India or Russia’s allies in Central
Asia, signal their disapproval of the continuing aggression against Ukraine. The circle
of Russian supporters is limited to its long-term partners or marginal outsiders of the
international community. Russia will look for ways to bring together an anti-Western
coalition, but these efforts highly likely will not live up to Moscow’s expectations.

Russia’s stubbornness to continue the war demonstrates its willingness to suffer more
political or economic damage than previously assessed. In order to prevent imaginary
threats to its national security or territorial integrity, Moscow is ready to sacrifice the
remains of its international reputation, economic stability, and human lives. Although
the sanctions are effective in limiting Russia’s growth, the mounting cost of war will
be financed without any regard to worsening welfare of its people.

When conventional military or diplomatic measures fail, Russia often resorts to nuclear
blackmail. Threats to use nuclear weapons or actions that put nuclear power plants
in danger are designed to send a twofold message. For the domestic audience, it
serves as a pretext to strengthen the narrative of Russia as a country under existential
threat. For Western audiences, the Kremlin thus signals its willingness to deter any
Western support to Ukraine.

**Russia’s digital and information isolation**
**is growing**

For more than a decade, the Russian government has systematically controlled the
Internet in the country, but the Kremlin’s war on Ukraine has significantly increased
Russia’s technological and online isolation from ‘unfriendly states’. Russia’s technological isolation is accelerated by internal and external factors such as the regime’s
efforts to strengthen national information security and the withdrawal of multinational
companies from the Russian market, as well as the economic sanctions imposed
on the country.

Russia has banned international media including social media that contain information contradictory to the regime’s narrative or allow their users to criticise the
Kremlin. Facebook and Instagram, which Russia blames for inciting ‘Russophobia’,
have been banned, also the BBC, CNN, Deutsche Welle, other international news
agencies, and major Ukrainian news websites. Following the decree signed by Putin,
over the past year Russia has seized control over cross-border transfer of Russian
citizens’ personal data. The regime has also obliged Russian banks and other organisations that collect biometric data to share their customers’ information with the
state authorities. Furthermore, the government has banned state-controlled entities
from using information protection software originating from ‘unfriendly countries’.

Russia’s international technological isolation has been further exacerbated after
Western technology companies such as Microsoft, Apple, and Intel suspended
their operations in the country. Russian telecommunication companies no longer
have access to Nokia, Ericsson, and Cisco equipment and services. The suspended
export of Western software, semiconductors, quantum computing products, and
advanced microchips hampers Russia’s technological development and increases
the shortage of components necessary for the military industry. Western universities
and think tanks have also suspended collaboration with their Russian counterparts.

Even though Russia is not among countries investing most in technological development, it regards digital technology sector as a driver for the country’s economic
growth. Russia seeks to implement its programme for technological development
until 2030–2035; therefore, the impact of international sanctions on the country’s
technological development will be evident only in the medium and long term. With
its increasing technological isolation from the West, Russia is likely to become more
dependent on Chinese technology in the near term.

**The Kaliningrad Region remains the biggest**
**threat in Lithuania’s neighbourhood**

The Kaliningrad Region is particularly important to the Russian political leadership
mostly as a military bridgehead in the Baltic Sea Region, and at the same time as an
isolated, economically vulnerable exclave surrounded by NATO countries.

The reaction of Kaliningrad population to the war has revealed that despite the
region’s relatively more active contacts with the West, in this regard Kaliningrad is
no different from the rest of the Russian Federation. Protests against the war and

mobilisation were negligible and subsided without any effort from the government
or law enforcement. Kaliningrad’s regional authorities organise mobilisation, gather
supplies for the Armed Forces, and support the Kremlin’s efforts to tighten its control
on the occupied regions in Ukraine. This way, regional authorities demonstrate their
loyalty to the Kremlin and its policies.

Before starting its aggression against Ukraine, Russia began preparations to secure
Kaliningrad’s provision with necessary supplies and ensure that the region’s infrastructure was operational in isolation mode. It provided additional ferries and cargo
ships for transportation of goods to the region by sea, strengthened Kaliningrad’s
capability to secure the supply of energy resources without relying on transit via Lithuania. It is highly likely that the decision to start the operation of Marshal Vasilevskiy,
the Floating Storage Regasification Unit (FSRU), which reached the region in early
February 2022, but whose liquefied natural gas cargo was not used until November,
was made to strengthen the energy independence of the Kaliningrad Region.

As Kaliningrad’s isolation from Western countries increases, the region’s economy
faces serious logistical challenges and a decline in industry production. Regional
authorities try to adapt to the situation with short-term solutions such as searching for
alternative logistic routes, subsidising industry, and trying to mitigate social impact of
the economic problems. According to our assessment, the Kremlin is trying to prepare
the Kaliningrad Region for complete isolation and ensure that its energy system is
capable of functioning independently. Regional authorities and businesses are concerned about economic problems and are keen on maintaining transit of goods and
energy resources via the EU territory. Currently, there are no signs that situation in the
region might challenge the regime’s control. In the future, when addressing challenges
to the Kaliningrad Region, the Kremlin will likely seek to demonstrate that relations
with European states can be maintained only on Russia’s terms. If transit conditions
are deemed unsatisfactory or if economic problems worsen in the exclave, the Kremlin
will likely increase tension in the Baltic Sea Region to get at least some concessions.

Russian military capabilities in the Kaliningrad Region were weakened due to their
involvement and losses in the war against Ukraine, but Russian military threat in
the Baltic Sea Region diminished only to a certain extent. Deployment to occupied
Ukrainian territories mostly affected the ground component, while air and naval
forces remained practically untouched. Back in January 2022, three landing ships

with personnel and combat equipment left the Kaliningrad Region for the Black Sea.
In addition, four multirole fighters Su-30SM/FLANKER-H were deployed to Crimea.
However, other capabilities have been left in the exclave and are still performing their
routine functions. What is more, the air component capabilities were additionally
strengthened by deploying at least four modern Su-30SM2 fighters to the Kaliningrad
Region. These new platforms compensated the losses incurred in Crimea.

Kaliningrad Military Grouping capabilities are sufficient to provide its critical function –
the Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) effect: to obstruct deployment of necessary
defence capabilities to the Baltic Sea Region and disrupt the freedom of manoeuvre
for opposing forces, thus attempting to gain an advantage in the initial phase of the
conflict. Military units that were not deployed to Ukraine – short- and long-range

_various estimates, 11th Army Corps combat_

missile units, air and coastal defence, and electronic warfare units – are essential for this
task and Kaliningrad Military Grouping will continue to create an A2/AD environment.

According to intelligence estimates, the decrease in Russian military threat in the
Baltic Sea Region will only be temporary. Russia will attempt to replenish ground
component losses incurred in Ukraine as quickly as possible. After that, the Russian
Armed Forces will continue to prioritise the growth of the Kaliningrad Region Grouping by creating and staffing additional military units, and modernising their combat
equipment. Nevertheless, these developments will highly depend on the duration and
outcome of the war in Ukraine – the longer and more costly the war, the more time
this modernisation will take.

**Iran’s support to the Russian war effort**
**in Ukraine**

Publicly Iran maintains a neutral stance towards the Russian aggression in Ukraine.
Tehran advocates for a ceasefire and stresses the necessity of diplomatic solution.
However, such rhetoric is nothing more than an elaborate attempt to conceal Iranian
diplomatic and military support to Russia.

The main element of Iranian support to Russia is supply of unmanned aerial systems
(UAS). Throughout the course of the conflict, Russia procured hundreds of UAS
from Iran, including both multirole UAS and various types of loitering munitions,
such as Shahed-136. This loitering munition (rebranded as Geran-2 by Russia)
accounts for the majority of UAS transfers from Iran to Russia. It is widely used by
the Russian Armed Forces to strike military and civilian targets across Ukraine,
particularly energy infrastructure, in order to harass Ukrainian population and force
it into submission. In addition, heavy use of Shahed-136s allows the Russian Armed
Forces to mitigate the negative impact of rapidly dwindling stocks of high-precision
munitions (Iskander, Kalibr, and other types of missiles).

In the diplomatic sphere, Iran’s capabilities to support Russia are limited, but that
does not deter Tehran from such attempts. First, Tehran votes according to Moscow’s interests in the United Nations General Assembly on the issues related with
Russia’s aggression. Furthermore, high-ranking Iranian officials continually blame
NATO for the war in Ukraine. They portray Russia as a victim, which was forced to
defend its national interests due to NATO’s provocations. This way Tehran amplifies
the Kremlin’s propaganda narratives.

By supporting Russia, Iran pursues several goals. It aims to prevent Moscow’s defeat
in Ukraine as it would highly likely result in a weaker Russia, whereas Iran needs
a strong ally as a counterbalance towards the West. Secondly, the war in Ukraine
presents a unique opportunity for Iran to undermine interests of Western states
outside the Middle East. Finally, Iran highly likely will use its current provision of
assistance as leverage to negotiate favourable terms for future modern weaponry
transfers from Russia.

##### BELARUS

�The Lukashenka regime supports Russia’s war against Ukraine
by allowing Russia to use Belarusian territory, airspace, and
infrastructure. Lukashenka has deployed units of the Belarusian
Armed Forces close to the Ukrainian border, but he is unwilling
to commit Belarusian troops to direct engagement in Ukraine.

�In the event of a military conflict with NATO, Russia would
have unrestricted access to Belarusian territory, airspace, and
infrastructure. Moscow would receive necessary military support
from Minsk.

�As Lukashenka’s main aim is to stay in power, the regime
will avoid any unpopular decisions while maintaining control of
society and political repression.

**Lukashenka takes part in Russia’s war against**
**Ukraine, albeit does not regard himself as an**
**aggressor**

Lukashenka has been actively supporting Russia’s narrative on Ukraine since autumn
2021. He has recurrently blamed the Ukrainian leadership for the escalation of the
regional security situation. According to Minsk claims, Ukraine has lost its sovereignty
and is now a U.S. tool to act against Russian interests. Lukashenka stepped up his
hostile rhetoric during the joint Russian and Belarusian exercise Zapad in September
2021, when for the first time he named Ukraine a military threat to Belarus.

In autumn 2021, referring to an allegedly worsening situation on the Ukrainian-Belarusian
border, Lukashenka announced the decisions to strengthen the border and hold a joint
Belarusian–Russian military exercise in Belarus. Under the disguise of Union Resolve
exercise, Russia deployed an unprecedented number of ground and air force units,
and military equipment to Belarus in early 2022. On 24 February, Russia launched an
offensive towards Kyiv from the territory of Belarus. Following Russian invasion into
Ukraine, Belarus deployed its military units along the Belarusian–Ukrainian border.

Lukashenka’s multifaceted support enabled Russia’s offensive in Ukraine from the North.
In addition to the Russian ground forces advance, Russian bombers and close air support
aircraft conducted air raids from Belarus. Belarus-deployed Russian units launched a
large number of Iskander missiles to Ukraine. Russian forces used Belarusian military
and civilian airfields for logistical and medical support. Belarus also delivered armoured
fighting vehicles, weapons, and ammunition supplies to the Russian Armed Forces.

Although Lukashenka accuses Ukraine of it allegedly planning to attack Belarus, he
publicly rejects the possibility that the Belarusian Armed Forces could take part in
combat actions in Ukraine. He admits that Belarus is taking part in Russia’s so-called
‘special operation’ but emphasizes that Belarusian role is limited to allegedly securing
Russia’s rear. Belarusian troops have been deployed at the border with Ukraine since
February 2022.

Russia has unlimited access to Belarusian military, civilian infrastructure and is
provided with other necessary support. In October 2022, Lukashenka announced
that due to increased threats to the Union State, the Russian-Belarusian Regional
Grouping of Forces would be deployed to Belarus. Under this pretext, Russia has
renewed a build-up of its forces in Belarus. Also, Russia plans to upgrade Belarusian
aircraft to carry nuclear weapons.

Unrestricted possibility for Russia to deploy its forces to Belarus negatively affects
the security of Lithuania and other NATO member states. In the event of a military
conflict with NATO, Russia would use Belarusian territory, air space, and infrastructure
without any limitations; Lukashenka would also provide Russia with military support.

**The situation of the Lukashenka regime is**
**dependent on the Kremlin’s success in the war**
**against Ukraine**

Lukashenka hopes that Russian financial support will help to mitigate the impact of
international sanctions and maintain the stability of Belarus’ finances. In 2022, the
Kremlin allowed Belarus to postpone repayment of its debts to Russia; the two countries
reached an agreement on new loans to finance various import substitution projects in
Belarus and an agreement on transport corridors for the export of Belarusian goods.
Simultaneously, Minsk tries to step up its economic relations with China; however,
with no significant results so far.

The Kremlin is interested in gradually increasing Belarus’ dependence, mostly by developing the Union State project. In November 2021, the countries signed an agreement
on 28 Union State programmes, which envisage common indirect tax collection rules
and the unification of various regulations pertaining to state finances. Negotiations
on the development of the Union State for the period of 2024–2026 are likely to start
in 2023. Just as previously, the Kremlin highly likely will raise demands for political
integration, which encompasses the establishment of supranational institutions or
adoption of common currency. The Kremlin might not consider these projects as a
vital necessity but will stick to the demand for establishing such institutions more as
leverage against Belarus.

With Moscow’s continued failures in Ukraine and growing economic losses due to
Western sanctions, it is highly likely that the Kremlin’s financial capacity to support
the Lukashenka regime will gradually diminish. Therefore, it is likely that in the near
term, the Kremlin will not force Lukashenka to agree to a form of cooperation that is not
acceptable to him, such as political integration of the two countries. Such demands
would increase Lukashenka’s distrust in the Kremlin, which is not beneficial for Putin
while the war against Ukraine continues.


-----

**With the Single Voting Day approaching, the**
**regime’s main short-term objective is to prevent**
**a new wave of protests**

The Belarusian regime has been successful in maintaining power. A strong contributing
factor has been Belarusian security and law enforcement agencies, which exercise
strict control over the population. Together with other key regime institutions – the
ministries, judiciary, and local councils – they remain loyal to Lukashenka.

A sham constitutional reform is in its final stage in Belarus with the sole purpose of
consolidating Lukashenka’s power. In early 2023, with the adoption of a law by Belarusian parliament a new supreme legislature – the All-Belarusian People’s Assembly (ABPA) – received constitutional status. The ABPA will consist of 1,200 members
and will be elected for a five-year term. ABPA’s mandate includes approval of foreign
policy strategic guidelines, security and economy; it will also rule on the validity of
election results, appoint judges of Constitutional and Supreme Courts, and members
of Central Electoral Commission. Changing the ABPA status gives additional options
for Lukashenka. Should he decide to withdraw from the post of president, he will be
able to retain power and influence in the country by becoming head of the ABPA.

It is highly likely that in 2023, the Belarusian regime will give most of its attention to
the preparation for upcoming elections. During the Single Voting Day – 25 February
2024 – local and parliamentary elections are to take place as well as the election of
the newly established ABPA. It is likely that in the run-up to the elections, intimidation
and political repression of the country’s population will continue in an effort to prevent
protests. In addition, the regime will seek to maintain a stable economic situation in
Belarus and abstain from any actions that could stir popular dissent, e.g. direct participation in military actions against Ukraine.

##### CHINA

�Xi Jinping has consolidated his power in China; however, the
emerging economic and social problems will pose a challenge
to the country’s leadership. The authorities will try to address
challenges by strengthening the security apparatus.

�Unification with Taiwan is one of Beijing’s major foreign policy and military strategy goals. Beijing will treat other countries’
actions standing in the way of China’s global and regional expansion as unacceptable.

�China’s declared course of relations with Russia –‘no-limits
friendship’ – is based on pragmatic partnership. In the near and

but will become increasingly unbalanced.


-----

**Russia’s war against Ukraine has not changed**
**Beijing’s goal of strengthening strategic**
**cooperation with Moscow**

Russia and China share overlapping strategic interests and perception of threats.
Both countries openly declare dissatisfaction with their own status in the international
system, speak out against the creation and expansion of Western blocs similar to
NATO, and express discontent towards the U.S. global leadership. They both promote
a peculiar understanding of democracy and human rights, seek to withstand against
‘colour revolutions’ and minimise the interference of external powers in their areas of
influence. The two countries stress that they have reached a new level of cooperation,
which is not curtailed by any sensitivities or changing international order.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has become a challenge for Beijing: it has to find a balance between its ‘non-interference policy’, partnership with Russia and the necessity
to uphold its image in the West because of its economic interests. Beijing evidently
supports Russia in the information and diplomatic domains, amplifies Moscow’s
narrative that the war in Ukraine was provoked by NATO’s expansion and disregard
for Russia’s security interests in Europe. It speaks out against military support to
Ukraine and implementation of sanctions against Russia, abstains during voting or
votes against resolutions that condemn Russia’s aggression. China helps to mitigate
the impact of the sanctions on Russia: it has increased the import of Russian energy
resources; Chinese banks also have integrated Russia’s financial institutions into
China’s interbank settlements system. Due to the likely damage to their reputation or
risk of secondary sanctions, large Chinese companies do not participate in Russian
sanction evasion schemes; however, some small and medium size Chinese companies act as intermediaries for Russia in purchasing sanctioned and dual use goods
and technologies.

We assess it is highly likely that China’s top political echelon had been notified that
Russia would be resorting to military action against Ukraine; however, they could
have predicted neither the scale nor the course of the military conflict at the time. It
is highly likely that China will continue to support Russia. Beijing assesses that its
support so far has not caused China any significant damage but has provided some
potential. It gives China opportunities to obtain energy resources under favourable
terms, to expand the operations of its companies in Russia, to increase its influence in
the regions traditionally claimed by Russia (Central Asia, the Arctic), and use Russia
as a partner to counterbalance Western dominance.

It is highly likely that Russia’s defeat in the war against Ukraine is against China’s
interests, especially if it causes the regime change in the Kremlin, as this would lead
to strategic uncertainty, which Beijing aspires to avoid. In the near and medium term,
Chinese–Russian cooperation on security, defence, diplomacy, economics, energy,
technology, and intelligence will intensify; however, in the long term these relations
will become increasingly unbalanced. Since China and Russia aspire to maintain their
strategic autonomy, it is unlikely that the two countries would elevate their cooperation
to the status of alliance based on collective defence in the medium term.

**By pursuing an aggressive policy towards**
**Taiwan, China strives to change the current**
**status quo in their relations**

The unification with Taiwan is a core element of Xi’s vision for ‘great rejuvenation of the
Chinese nation’. Xi presents the unification as a historical inevitability, tries to justify
his plans by historical interpretations, ideological opposition, and alleged threats to
national security; he simultaneously instigates nationalism and accelerates modernisation of the People’s Liberation Army.


-----

**China uses new initiatives to shape the global**
**security agenda and create a counterbalance**
**to Western alliances**

The Global Security Initiative (GSI), presented by President Xi, aims at creating an alternative global security architecture. The GSI is based on China’s traditional principles of
security and Comprehensive National Security concept developed by Xi. It also encompasses the idea of ‘indivisible security’, which has been systematically used by Putin to
criticise NATO.

Seek a common, comprehensive, collective, and
sustainable security vision

Respect the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of
all countries

Adhere to the aims and
principles of the UN
Charter


Maintain security both in Adhere to the principle of


Resolve disagreements and
disputes between countries
peacefully, through dialogue
and consultations


Adhere to the principle of
indivisible security

the traditional and nontraditional areas


The GSI marks a new stage in the implementation of China’s (geo)strategy. Beijing
projects the GSI, the Belt and Road Initiative, aimed at securing economic expansion,
and the Global Development Initiative, which would strengthen Beijing’s dominance in
international organisations, as a foundation for China’s goal to become a leading power
in determining the global security agenda.

China uses various international formats to rally other states’ support to the GSI. It presented its vision at the BRICS Summit and the congress of the member states of the
Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. China is also seeking to transfer the GSI provisions
into international agreements. For example, the GSI provisions were included into the
China–Africa Cooperation Vision 2035, the agreement on bilateral security with the
Solomon Islands, and the joint Chinese–Belarusian declaration. The GSI has been most
favourably received by developing and / or authoritarian states that cultivate strong economic ties with China. Such Chinese position is also welcomed by the countries that are
openly antagonistic to the West, such as Russia, Belarus, Iran, and a number of African
and South American countries.

China has not defined specific areas of cooperation under the GSI. It is highly likely that
in the near and medium term, China will be referring to this initiative in order to bolster
cooperation in the military and intelligence domains as well as in counter-terrorism and
stand against ‘colour revolutions’. Russia’s and Belarus’ deeper involvement in these areas
of cooperation would have a negative impact on Lithuania’s national security interests,
because it would enable these regimes to further develop their security apparatus and
allocate more resources for repressive measures against their populations. It is highly
likely that the procedure of joining the GSI will not be formalized and that the initiative will

which seeks to demonstrate to Chinese population that the
regime is capable of securing control of the island
_Reuters / Scanpix_

In Beijing’s view, political processes in Taiwan and the region are currently unfavourable to the prospects of reunification. The majority of Taiwan’s population is in favour
of maintaining the status quo in relations with Beijing, but since 2018, the portion of


-----

Taiwanese supporting the idea of the island’s independence has been increasing
(25.2 percent of population favoured it in 2022). China criticises political, economic,
and defence initiatives in the Asia-Pacific region led by the U.S., such as QUAD and
AUKUS. Beijing believes that these initiatives are part of the plan devised by the U.S.
and its allies in the region to contain China’s expansion. China is particularly opposed
to the strengthening of Japan’s military capabilities, as it believes that in the event of
a conflict with Taiwan, they could be used against China. Taiwan’s efforts to develop
relations with democracies are also viewed in a negative light, as these could be
employed to rally international diplomatic support in the event of a conflict.

Beijing openly demonstrates that it is prepared to cross a red line in its relations with
Taiwan. Reacting to the visit by the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives to
Taiwan in the summer of 2022, China held unprecedented military exercises simulating a total blockade of Taiwan. During the exercises, the Chinese naval and air forces
on numerous occasions violated the median line, which divides China’s and Taiwan’s
territorial waters, and for the first time in history, launched a missile over Taiwan’s main
island, which later landed in Japan’s exclusive economic zone. After the exercises,
Xi stressed that China was not ruling out the use of military force against Taiwan and
initiated the adoption of amendments to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Constitution. They state that China will pursue to implement the ‘one country, two systems’
principle with regard to Taiwan. In 2020, China betrayed ‘one country, two systems’
principle applied to Hong Kong, what shows that China itself does not respect its
commitments and obligations. Since then, Taiwanese society has been particularly
sceptical about China’s similar initiatives.

During Xi’s third term in office, China’s aggressiveness towards Taiwan will increase;
however, the military invasion is unlikely. China will continue to hold military exercises
around Taiwan in order to intimidate Taiwanese society, to deter Taiwan’s partners
from collaboration with Taipei, and test the reaction of the international community.
It is possible that China will carry out military provocations against Taiwan’s smaller
islands and will obstruct supply of raw material to Taiwan as well as operation of
international trade routes near Taiwan. In the medium term, China will pursue to
decrease its economic and technological dependence on the West significantly, as
this would be China’s critical vulnerability if it came under sanctions in the event of a
military invasion of Taiwan.

**Xi’s concentration of power in the CCP poses**
**a risk of strategic miscalculations**

Xi has started an unprecedented third term as general secretary of the CCP. He has
not only consolidated his status within the CCP, secured prospects for indefinite rule
but also eliminated his political rivals from key positions in the party.

-----

Xi has appointed officials to the top-ranking positions in the party with disregard to the
unwritten rules practiced by former CCP leaders, such as collective decision-making,
age limits, and requirements for competence and experience. The main criteria for
the appointments were personal relations with Xi and the candidate’s political loyalty.
For example, the party’s secretary in Shanghai, Li Qiang, who had proven his loyalty
to Xi by implementing the ‘zero COVID-19’ policy in the city, was appointed to the
second-highest CCP position for his third term. Other Xi loyalists, such as Minister of
Foreign Affairs Wang Yi, who had followed Xi’s guidelines and mobilised the country’s
diplomatic corps for ‘wolf warrior diplomacy’, or Xi’s comrade Li Xi, who had helped
him to implement ‘anticorruption campaigns’ against his political opponents, were also
promoted to the top positions in the party. The top echelons of the CCP – the Politburo
and the Politburo Standing Committee – are now entirely dominated by Xi’s inner
circle, who have pushed representatives of other CCP factions out of these positions.

Taking into account Xi’s unprecedented political power and tendency to hand out key
party posts only to people who are loyal to him, the likelihood of mistakes in strategic
political decisions increases. It is likely that fearing accusations of disloyalty, a part of
Xi’s entourage will not only abstain from criticising the leader’s initiatives but will also
avoid presenting information that goes against the leader’s expectations, for example,
about the effect that certain political decisions might have on the country’s economy
or China’s preparedness for a military invasion of Taiwan.

**Internal tensions in China force the regime**
**to search for external enemies, justifying**
**repressions against its society**

China faces long-term structural economic challenges as it has been unable to reach
its objectives of economic growth; the country’s production output, domestic consumption and exports are declining, while unemployment is on the rise. Signs of crisis
have been observed in China’s real estate industry, which contributes about a third


-----

of the country’s GDP. Due to certain aspects of state regulation, Chinese real estate
developers fall behind their obligations, whereas residents who have acquired unfinished properties with bank loans refuse to pay interest until construction companies

-----

have completed their works. This situation has been affecting China’s financial sector,
with part of the banks now facing capital liquidity problems.

Due to the worsening economic situation and other controversial political decisions,
China begins to face social unrest. In 2022, public protests broke out over the extremely
strict COVID-19 restrictions, human rights abuses, and the regime censorship as well
as defaults of banks and construction companies. Such protests are not a common
phenomenon in Chinese society, where the CCP regime and its ideology have held a
tight control over political and civil rights.

In an effort to prevent social unrest in the country, Xi focuses on the revision and
expansion of China’s security apparatus. In 2022, after corruption scandals rocked
the Chinese Ministry of Public Security, which is responsible for counterintelligence,
police work, and border security, Xi appointed his close associate, Wang Xiahong,
as the new minister. Following the 20th CCP Congress, the heads of Chinese civil
intelligence (Ministry of State Security) and the United Front Work Department,
which is responsible for the spread of political influence abroad, were appointed to
the Politburo, while a member of the commission for coordinating national security
issues, Ding Xuexiang, was elected to the Politburo Standing Committee. These
appointments indicate not only Xi’s readiness to counter internal threats but also
to expand the mandate of intelligence services and other agencies responsible for
influence operations.

It is highly likely that although social tensions in China will be fueled by slowing
economy and unpopular decisions in the near and medium term, any manifestations
of discontent will be suppressed with the help of China’s security institutions. As
Xi has been increasingly vocal about the alleged threats to national security arising
from external actors, ‘colour revolutions’, sabotage, disruptive activities, and promotion of separatism, Chinese political leadership is likely to use these arguments
increasingly to justify the use of the country’s security apparatus against its citizens.
Protests in China are unlikely to have major influence on the regime’s stability in short
and near term.

shifted its focus and resources to activity in Ukraine and against it.

�Russian intelligence services remain active on the Russian–
Lithuanian border and pose a threat to Lithuanian citizens visiting
Russian border areas. Russian intelligence services have also been

in countries bordering Russia.

�Representatives of the Belarusian democratic opposition, the
regime critics, or Belarusians fleeing persecution are the priority
targets for Belarusian intelligence services.

**Russian intelligence searches for new methods**
**to collect intelligence in Europe, but its PRIMARY**
**FOCUS is the war against Ukraine**

The intensity of human intelligence operations conducted by Russian intelligence
has fallen in Europe. As a response to Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, European
countries expelled more than 400 Russian intelligence officers who had worked
under diplomatic cover. This coordinated decision has negatively affected Russia’s
intelligence gathering capabilities. Under such circumstances, Russian intelligence
highly likely will resort to other information gathering methods and will search for
new intelligence opportunities. Russia likely will use cyber espionage, officers under
non-traditional (non-diplomatic) cover or with fake identities (the so-called ‘illegals’),
and intelligence from the Russian territory more often. Simultaneously, Russia highly
likely will pursue efforts to restore intelligence positions in its diplomatic representations by delegating new officers.

Russia’s ability to perform human intelligence in Lithuania has also diminished. In
2022, five intelligence officers operating under diplomatic cover were expelled from
Lithuania. The sanctions against Russia, which include travel restrictions for Russian
citizens, limit the possibilities for Russian nationals collaborating with intelligence
to visit Lithuania and, therefore, a potential for human intelligence from the Russian
territory. With the decreasing number of border crossings between Lithuania and
Russia, Russian intelligence likely will intensify its efforts to recruit individuals without
any access to sensitive information.

Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), which is also responsible for border protection, has become more active on the Russian–Lithuanian border. Lithuanian citizens

-----

visiting the border area with Russia or crossing the Lithuanian–Russian border are at
risk of becoming targets for the FSB provocations. Those travelling to Belarus face
a similar threat.

Currently, the FSB dedicates most of its foreign intelligence capabilities to operations
against Ukraine. The service plays a pivotal role in securing the control of Russian-occupied territories, establishment of occupation administrations, and identification of
residents loyal to Ukraine. The Department for Operational Information (DOI) of FSB 5th
Service (intelligence and influence operations), the FSB Military Counterintelligence
Department (counterintelligence in the Armed Forces and military intelligence), the
FSB Special Purpose Centre (combat support), and other FSB units are most active
in Ukraine and against it.

Lithuanian citizens who travel to Ukraine to provide support to the Ukrainian Armed
Forces or local residents, especially those who visit territories close to combat zone,
face a risk of becoming targets for Russian intelligence. In case of detention by the
Russian Armed Forces or pro-Russian militant groups, Lithuanian citizens would
be handed over to intelligence officers. In spring 2022, a Lithuanian national was
detained, interrogated, and subjected to psychological and physical violence, highly
likely to ascertain whether the detainee had any connections to Ukrainian military or
intelligence.

The Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces (GRU) constantly collects intelligence on strategic military and civilian infrastructure in countries bordering Russia. Such information allows Russia to assess military capability
and weaknesses of its opponents. Russia uses this knowledge not only for planning
subversions that target state functions and democracy procedures but also military
operations, like the one against Ukraine’s critical infrastructure. It is highly likely that
most of the targeting information about Ukraine’s strategic infrastructure was collected
by the GRU, which is responsible for collection, processing, and verification of such
intelligence during peacetime.


-----

Despite the war against Ukraine, Russian intelligence services retain their interest in
Lithuania and continue to collect information on military and civilian infrastructure.
For this purpose, they use cyber espionage, which allows them to collect open-source
intelligence or penetrate the systems of state institutions.

**Belarusian intelligence services recruit their**
**own nationals fleeing to Lithuania**

After the 2020 Belarusian presidential election, tens of thousands of Belarusian
citizens arrived in Lithuania, fleeing arrest, imprisonment, or other types of legal
prosecution. The growing Belarusian diaspora in Lithuania leads to increased activity
of Belarusian intelligence services.

According to available intelligence, the priority targets for Belarusian intelligence
services are representatives of the Belarusian democratic opposition, regime opponents as well as methods of their entry into Lithuania. Some individuals who enter
Lithuania are exploited by Belarusian intelligence and law-enforcement services – the
State Security Committee (KGB), the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General
Staff of the Belarusian Armed Forces (Belarusian GRU), and the Main Directorate
for Combating Organised Crime and Corruption of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of
Belarus (GUBOPiK).

The KGB infiltrates its agents among fleeing Belarusians. In Lithuania, they collect
intelligence about their diaspora, democratic opposition and its organisations, Lithuania’s intelligence institutions, border crossing procedures, and organisers of legal and
illegal entry to Lithuania. In case of their return to Belarus, the regime’s propaganda
exploits these individuals in smear campaigns against Lithuania, its state institutions,
and the Belarusian democratic opposition.

Starting from 2021, the Belarusian regime and the KGB are implementing the ‘Way
Home’ initiative, which offers members of the Belarusian diaspora an allegedly safe
return to Belarus in exchange for information (spying). For the provided opportunity to
return home, the regime forces some Belarusian citizens to go public on Belarusian
television with their stories on escape and return. Belarusian opposition activists and
NGO representatives keep receiving messages through Telegram social network
accounts inviting them to return to Belarus. A considerable number of the Belarusian
diaspora representatives in Lithuania say they have received such offers.

It is highly likely that in the near term, Belarusian intelligence services will step up
their efforts to exploit the growing Belarusian diaspora in order to gather intelligence


-----

about Lithuania’s institutions, Belarusian democratic opposition, and diaspora. The
Lukashenka regime will use such information to defame Lithuania and Belarusian
democratic opposition, and weaken the morale of diaspora members. It is possible that
in the near term, the propaganda and disinformation campaigns orchestrated by the
Belarusian regime will increase the Belarusian diaspora’s disillusion with the Belarusian opposition. Belarusian intelligence services will exploit disappointed Belarusians
for gathering intelligence and influence operations within their diaspora in Lithuania.

**Authoritarian regimes are changing the model of**
**privatization of military power**

Private military and security companies (PMSCs) operating in conflict zones are a
worldwide practice. However, Russian approach to the activity of PMCSs differs from
the Western perspective.

Western PMSCs operate according to national and international obligations, do not
directly engage in combat and mostly carry out security, logistics, and military training
tasks. The activities of Russian PMSCs, formally prohibited by the Russian Penal
Code, are most in line with the mercenary concept.

Russian-controlled PMSCs directly engage in combat actions. Although fighters of
various ideologies, including ultra-right nationalists, are joining the ranks of Russian
PMSCs, financial reward is the main motivation of Russian mercenaries.

In total, the Russian PMSC sector is saturated with several dozen companies with different functions. Their operations include not only combat actions but also intelligence
collection, information operations, or political consulting to authoritarian regimes.
The most widely known Russian PMSC Wagner, which is under the supervision of
the GRU, is active in Ukraine and several countries outside Europe.

We assess that Russian PMSCs would be capable of carrying out limited-scale operations against European countries. If tasked, their efforts could include non-kinetic
activities, such as reconnaissance and intelligence collection on critical infrastructure.


-----

In addition, experience of covert operations and undefined legal status would enable
PMSCs to carry out subversive actions, sabotage, or instigate social unrest.

Current and former members of Russian PMSCs have engaged in martial arts, first
aid, and similar paramilitary training in Europe. Russian intelligence and security
services are known to exploit this area of activity as a platform for candidate search
and recruitment. As such cases are currently observed in other European countries,
it is possible that Russian PMSCs and Russian intelligence could use the same
_modus operandi in Lithuania. Thus, participation in paramilitary activities organised_
by Russian PMSCs would create fertile ground for recruitment.

Finally, Belarusian PMSCs play a part in Russia’s war against Ukraine. Saboteur
groups formed in Belarus are designated to support Russian aggression by sowing
instability on the border with Ukraine, infiltrating Ukraine's territory and destroying
Western-supplied military equipment, ammunition, or humanitarian aid.

Gardservis, a Belarusian PMSC that has connections with the Presidential administration and functions similarly to PMSC Wagner, takes part in the establishment of
these groups. Recruitment for saboteur groups takes place not only among PMSC
members but also inside Belarusian security apparatus, including Presidential Security Service. Such background likely expedites the formation and training of saboteur
groups. According to intelligence assessment, it is possible that such groups could
conduct sabotage activities inside European countries that provide military and
humanitarian aid to Ukraine.

##### CYBER SECURITY

�Russia’s aggression against Ukraine motivates hackers and
hacktivists to get involved in the conflict. Cyber criminals and
cyber activists have supported Russia by trying to disrupt information processes and sowing turmoil in society.

�While cyber espionage remains the main line of operation for
state actors, the number of destructive attacks has increased.
It is highly likely that the threat to organisations’ information
systems of NATO, EU, and other states will grow, especially due
to increased geopolitical tensions.

�Cyber-enabled information operations against Lithuania by the
Ghostwriter, a cyber-enabled influence campaign, have subsided
due to its redirected effort towards Ukraine. It is likely that the
decrease is temporary, the ongoing collection of personal data
indicates preparation for future attacks.


-----

**War against Ukraine did not decrease threats in**
**Lithuanian cyber space**

The most active cyber groups that act against Lithuania are connected with Russia and
China. Their priority remains continuous long-term collection of information related
to Lithuanian internal and foreign affairs. Cyber groups seek to access government
institutions’ and organisations’ IT systems; they gather both target information and
technical data about the systems’ architecture and vulnerabilities. They also try to
create mechanisms that allow long-term access to the systems. A temporary decrease
in cyber group hostile activities caused by Russia’s actions in Ukraine is unlikely to
have a major effect on their long-lasting malicious operations in the medium term.

Russian cyber groups, coordinated by intelligence agencies, use the tools usually
attributed to cyber criminals and also cooperate with non-state hackers. Attacks by
cyber criminals are increasing in number and scope. It is likely that some of the attacks
attributed to cyber criminals in fact are instigated by adversarial countries.

This collaboration is based on mutual benefits – state actors exploit this opportunity to
mask their involvement in malicious activities, whereas criminal groups receive financial and technological support, acquire experience, and immunity from prosecution.

The war in Ukraine has demonstrated that criminal hacker groups, such as Killnet,
Killnet, XakNet Team, or Noname are ready to get involved in the conflict on the Russian side. In recent years, cyber criminals and cyber activists have supported Russia
by trying to disrupt information processes and sowing turmoil in society.

In 2022, these groups periodically conducted DDoS attacks against government
and private sectors in Ukraine, the Baltic States, Poland, and other supporters of
Ukraine. In summer, they carried out attacks against a wide spectrum of targets in
Lithuania – critical infrastructure, government institutions, logistics sector, and other
organisations. The attacks did not cause any direct and lasting damage, but cyber
activists highly likely will continue to target countries that provide support to Ukraine
or are not favourable to Russia.

Attacks
against
Ukraine and
countries

Ukraine
in 2022

March April May June


While cyber espionage remains the main line of operation of state actors, destructive
attacks have been increasingly prevalent. The purpose of these attacks is not only
to disrupt the targeted system activities and critical processes but also to destroy
the data stored and managed within them. The main targets of attacks are usually IT
networks of governmental organisations and critical infrastructure.

While in recent years attackers have mainly targeted Ukraine, they have also acted
against NATO countries. In July 2022, hackers publicly attributed to Iran managed
to get access to data managed by the Albanian government institutions. They compromised the information systems with malware capable of irreversibly corrupting
the data. As a result, websites of Albanian electronic services and institutions were
partly disrupted. It is highly likely that in the future, the threat to organisations’ information systems of NATO, EU, and other states will grow, especially due to increased
geopolitical tensions.


-----

July August September November December


In 2022, Ghostwriter, a cyber-enabled influence campaign, significantly decreased its
activity against NATO states. Whereas in 2021, at least 11 cyber-enabled information
operations were launched against Lithuania, in 2022, there was only one. Contrary to
previous attacks, this attack did not aim to spread disinformation about Lithuania’s
internal and foreign affairs. The purpose of the attack was to get access to social
media and e-mail accounts. It is highly likely that perpetrators were trying not only to
get to the information held within these accounts but also to use the compromised
accounts for spreading disinformation in the future.

It is likely that the decrease in cyber-enabled information operations in Lithuania is
temporary and related to redirected effort towards Ukraine, which has been a target
of numerous Ghostwriter attacks in recent years. Nonetheless, attempts to gather

##### INFORMATION SECURITY

�Lithuania-based Kremlin propaganda producers continue to
disseminate narratives favourable to Russia. Ukrainian refugees
in Lithuania are among the targets for Russian propaganda
campaigns.

�Russia tries to retaliate against the removal of Soviet monuments from public spaces. Russian Embassy diplomats collected
information about the dismantlement of Soviet military memorials. The information was used in pre-trial investigations against
Lithuanian citizens.

�By promoting information about alleged desecration of Soviet
military cemeteries and the glorification of the Nazism, Russia
attempts to portray Lithuania as an enemy.

**Lithuania remains a target for Kremlin**
**propaganda**

After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Lithuania imposed tighter restrictions on the Kremlin
propaganda, which made Lithuania oriented Russian propaganda news sites more
difficult to access. In spite of these measures, managers of propaganda outlets have
not suspended collaboration with content providers in Lithuania and other countries.
These individuals still gather information and produce propaganda products usually
used in information campaigns tailored for Russian domestic audience to fuel negative
attitude towards Lithuania.


_In an effort to demonstrate that its inter-_
_national isolation is allegedly diminishing,_
_the Kremlin regime attempts to attract_
_Lithuanian residents to pro-Russian pub-_
_lic activity. Organisations subordinated to_
_or controlled by the Russian government_
_have used their contact network in Lithu-_
_ania to search for individuals who would be_
_willing to attend international events with_


_the purpose of supporting the Kremlin’s_
_aggressive foreign policy. Several Lithuanian_
_citizens who maintain contacts with Rus-_
_sian entities took part in such events that_
_usually serve as a platform for spreading_
_false information about the alleged sys-_
_tematic violation of human rights in Europe_
_and for accumulating support for Russia’s_
_aggression against Ukraine._


Distributors of pro-Kremlin propaganda in Lithuanian information domain primarily
use social media. They run targeted campaigns against Ukrainian refugees accusing
them of law violations, abuse of social support, and promotion of extremist ideologies. After tens of thousands of Ukrainian refugees settled in Lithuania, a number of
messages with unconfirmed information appeared online; they falsely accused the
refugees of committing crimes and instigating ethnic hatred.

**Kremlin tries to exploit Muslim communities**
**in Europe**

The Kremlin uses Muslim communities to spread propaganda that justifies its
aggressive policies. Some Russian Muslim leaders have proclaimed a fatwa justifying Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and declared that Muslims who die in combat
on the Russian side would be considered martyrs.

The Kremlin also sets up organisations that try to
establish contacts with European state institutions
and Muslim communities. One of such pro-Kremlin
organisations is the European Muslim Forum (EMF),
established in 2018, which maintains contacts with
some former or present leaders of Muslim communities in European countries, including Lithuania.
Key positions in the EMF belong to the leaders of
Russian Muslim organisations who have connec
_euromuslimforum.org_ tions with the Russian Presidential Administration.

Forum emblem,
_euromuslimforum.org_


The EMF spreads anti-Western propaganda narratives about thriving Islamophobia
in some European countries and war crimes allegedly committed by the U.S. in the
Middle East.

The EMF takes part in projects dedicated to the memory of Akhmad Kadyrov, the
father of Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, while the EMF President Abdul Vakhed
Niyazov maintains contacts with Kadyrov’s administration. Niyazov took part in the
creation of propaganda coverage about Chechen forces fighting in Volnovakha, a town
near Mariupol. In October 2022, he was banned from entering the Schengen area.


-----

**Kremlin actively strives to preserve its**
**expansionist historical narrative**

Russia justifies its expansionist policy by employing a historical narrative based on
various manipulations of the Soviet victory against the Nazi Germany. This narrative promotes the Kremlin regime’s fictitious claims about exclusive interests in the
post-Soviet region, whereas its aggressive policy and military actions are justified by
the need to protect Russia’s influence. Putin has compared the war against Ukraine
to the military campaigns of Tsar Peter I, whose goals, as Putin put it, were not to
conquer new lands but reclaim former rightful territories. The Kremlin justifies the
war against Ukraine based on contrived arguments that allegedly Ukraine threatened
Russia and had to be ‘demilitarised’ and ‘de-Nazified’.

Commemoration of the Soviet victory is an important event for Kremlin’s history policy
to retain the ideological influence over the countries formerly occupied by the Soviet
Union. Every year on the Victory Day (9 May), Soviet military memorials become places
of public gatherings for the members of society who support Russian vision of history.

In 2022, a campaign to dismantle Soviet military monuments was launched in Lithuania,
which caused Russia’s retaliatory action. Russian Embassy diplomats tried to establish
contacts with Lithuanian state and municipal institutions and collected information
about the dismantlement of Soviet military memorials. This information was used by
Russian law enforcement institutions in pre-trial investigations against Lithuanian
citizens. In retaliation to the monument dismantling in Lithuania, Russia embarked
on the destruction of public objects that are located on its territory and are significant
to the Lithuanian national identity. The persecution of Lithuanian culture-promoting
organisations began; some of them were forced to cease their activity.


-----

**Pro-Kremlin propaganda narratives designed**
**for Western societies**

Russia’s propaganda narratives orientated towards its domestic audience have little
effect on Lithuanian and Western societies. Narratives tailored for the Western audiences by Kremlin propaganda actors feature topics that are sensitive in the West.

**Economic and energy shortages. The Kremlin’s information policy**
actors attempt to convince Western societies that international sanctions against Russia will have a significantly bigger negative impact on
Western countries than on Russia. European economies will collapse
and the governments will fail to ensure their citizens’ basic needs if they
refuse to buy Russian energy resources.

**Instigation of conflicts among Western states. Russian propaganda**
often draws attention to disagreements between European states,
attempts to instigate conflicts on war-related topics between the U.S.
and EU; also between Western and Eastern Europe. Kremlin policy
supporters disseminate in Lithuania disinformation that Poland allegedly
poses a threat to Lithuania’s independence and territorial integrity, since
following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine Poland significantly increased its
defence spending.

**Negative image of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the**
**Ukrainian nation. During the first days of invasion, Russian propagan-**
dists disseminated a narrative that Western military support to Ukraine
would only prolong the war, whereas the Russian Armed Forces would
achieve a victory that will result in the occupation of the entire Ukrainian
territory. After Russia’s military setbacks and liberation of some previously occupied Ukrainian territories, Kremlin policy supporters started
to disseminate fake news that Ukraine allegedly was reselling donated
weapons and military equipment to other countries, even to Russia.

Russia uses a narrative of fight against the Nazism as a justification to consolidate
its hegemony in the region. Allegations against Lithuania of desecrated Soviet military cemeteries and Nazism glorification contribute to a depiction of Lithuania as an
enemy, particularly to Russian society, and could potentially be used as an excuse
for Kremlin’s aggressive actions. Russia likely will seek to prosecute Lithuanian citizens in connection with the removal of Soviet monuments and force representatives
of Lithuanian communities in Russia to cease their activities or join anti-Lithuanian
propaganda campaigns.

###### ECONOMIC AND ENERGY SECURITY

�As international sanctions imposed on Russia have had a
negative impact on the country’s economy, Russian businesses
try to establish schemes to bypass sanctions by searching for
intermediaries, including in Lithuania.

�Russia seeks to use energy supplies to Europe as leverage;
however, it highly likely will lose it in the near term.

�Rosatom tries to retain position in the nuclear energy market;
however, according to intelligence, the technologies it provides
are defective. Rosatom’s technological problems are well illustrated by the situation at the Belarusian Nuclear Power Plant.

**Sanctions cause major problems to Russia and**
**its entities that try to bypass them**

International sanctions have caused major challenges to Russia’s energy, industrial,
military, and financial sectors. A lack of Western goods, equipment, and components
has caused operational difficulties for Russian companies. According to available
intelligence, Russian citizens and businesses seek to organise sanction evasion
schemes to obtain the needed critical equipment or export the production that is under
sanctions. Their priority is to secure the supply of dual-use goods and equipment.
Attempts to circumvent the sanctions involve EU-based companies, mostly those


-----

that have developed trade relationships with Russia and Belarus and provided them
with Western goods and equipment.

Most common methods to evade export control and the sanctions regime are declaration of goods with the customs using misleading codes and descriptions, thus
concealing the true purpose of the goods and concealing the end-users with a help
of a long chain of intermediaries.

Russian individuals and legal persons under sanctions are interested in opportunities
and methods of transferring funds, establishing shell companies in third countries,
evading restrictions on money transfers, and restructuring their businesses by concealing the ultimate beneficial owner.

Sanctioned Russian individuals and legal persons often organise transfer of their
businesses to third persons or family members, make fake business sale deals and /
or rename their companies. Business and financial management consultants, both
companies and private individuals, who assist the entities in trying to circumvent the
sanctions are not merely risking the reputation of their own or of the state where they
operate but also may be held legally liable.


_Russia tries to restrict public information_
_about individuals and legal persons associ-_
_ated with the Kremlin, their companies, and_
_assets. The Kremlin highly likely will con-_


_tinue to exercise control over such informa-_
_tion and restrict access to the information_
_about the sanctioned Russian citizens and_
_legal persons even further._


**Technologies being developed in Lithuania may be**
**targeted by hostile foreign actors**

Rapidly developing emerging and disruptive technologies (EDTs) play a major role in
the global distribution of power among the U.S., China, and Russia. These technologies
are increasingly regarded as a potential tool to achieve an economic breakthrough,
strategic and operational military advantage. Therefore, countries pursue ambitious
EDT development plans.


-----

_Emerging and disruptive technologies_
_(EDTs) can replace or improve the func-_
_tions of the existing technologies, influence_
_new approaches and capabilities. Currently_


_artificial intelligence, big data as well as_
_quantum, autonomous, space, and other_
_technologies hold the greatest potential._


With an increase in international technological competition and the sanctions on
technology exports to Russia and Belarus in place, Western entities, including Lithuanian companies and academia, which specialise in EDT research and development,
become potential targets for hostile states. Industry and science representatives
from China, Russia, and other countries developing military technologies seek to
collaborate with technology companies and the academic community, place profitable
production orders, offer participation in joint research projects, or promise to invest
in commercial technologies.

Companies and members of the academic community who become engaged in collaboration with third countries contributing to the development of military technologies
put their future prospects at risk as such deals may damage their own reputation.
Usually, hostile states strive to take over technologies and solutions developed by
the West using the following methods:

 **Business and science partnership, including contract negotiations and**
**technology-based consultations**

 **Partnership with universities that have ties to defence contractors**

 **Foreign research funding or sponsorship**

 **Admission of international students to higher education institutions**

 **Participation in international trade exhibitions and conferences**

 **Recruiting technical experts to serve as advisors on government and**
**industry projects**

 **Recruiting technical experts by intelligence services of hostile states**

**Chinese military company covertly tried to**
**acquire technology being developed in Lithuania***

After posting information on social media about the new image recognition software,
the Lithuanian start-up H-M Visionary received an offer from a company called
Unolexar. In an e-mail addressed to H-M Visionary’s CEO, this company introduced
itself as a Japanese technology start-up and expressed its interest in developing
software. The Japanese start-up also offered to invest in the company’s further
development to adjust technological solutions to the investor’s needs.

Unolexar noted that the Lithuanian technology would be used to develop solutions
for autonomous vehicles. H-M Visionary found the offer extremely attractive because
the start-up had been in operation for only a year and was actively looking for new
investments.

H-M Visionary’s CEO decided to search for information online about Unolexar, but
everything he managed to find was that the company had been founded a month
ago and had only one registered employee. Driven by suspicion, the CEO consulted
his partners in the Netherlands, who claimed that Unolexar had also approached
them with an offer to invest in artificial intelligence solutions for business management systems that the Dutch start-up had been developing. They intended to enter
such collaboration but then found out that Unolexar was in fact a Chinese military
company engaged in supplying Western technologies to China and its introduction
as a Japanese technology start-up acted as a cover.

Based on his partner’s experience and seeking to preserve the reputation of his own
start-up, H-M Visionary’s CEO refused what had initially appeared an attractive offer.

**Russia runs out of options to use energy supplies**
**as leverage**

Before the invasion of Ukraine, Russia had reduced its export of natural gas to Europe
in an effort to increase tensions in the energy sector. After invading Ukraine, Russia
continued to manipulate the supply of natural gas. Following instructions from the
Kremlin, Gazprom unilaterally ordered its customers in EU member states to pay for
natural gas in Russian roubles, cutting off the supply to the countries that refused to
accept the new terms. Before the Nord Stream gas pipeline incidents, the corporation
had reduced the supply of natural gas to the EU, allegedly due to technical problems.

Since Lithuania is capable of securing the supply of natural gas independently from
Gazprom, it makes Lithuania immune from Russia’s manipulations. In the near term,
Russia will be increasingly running out of options to use energy supplies as leverage
in pursuit of political goals with regard to other EU countries. They systematically
reduce their dependence on Russian natural gas by implementing new sustainable
energy projects and strengthening their liquefied natural gas infrastructure.


_The export of natural gas to the EU used to_
_generate a considerable share of Russia’s_
_national budget, whereas Russia’s ability to_


_redirect these exports to other markets_
_is limited by lack of infrastructure and by_
_international sanctions._


We assess that it is possible that Gazprom will try to regain part of the Baltic and EU
market by employing natural gas trading intermediaries it has already collaborated
with in the past or whose representatives have influential connections in Gazprom
structures.

**Rosatom develops projects abroad, but its**
**technologies are defective**

Rosatom has been implementing nuclear energy projects abroad by building and
servicing nuclear power plants and supplying uranium products. Income from these
operations makes up the majority of the corporation’s revenue. In this way, Rosatom


-----

not only contributes to Russia’s national budget and finances the growth of the country’s military capabilities but also helps to project Russia’s political influence abroad.

The corporation tries to retain position in the nuclear energy market; it claims that it
constantly develops new technologies that ensure high nuclear energy safety standards. According to intelligence, the technologies provided by the corporation are in
fact defective, whereas Rosatom management usually takes the interests of Russia’s
political leadership into consideration.

Rosatom’s technological problems are well illustrated by the situation at the Belarusian Nuclear Power Plant (BelNPP), a Rosatom project, and nuclear safety incidents
there, which pose a threat to Lithuania’s national security interests. In April 2022,
BelNPP management shut down the first power unit for routine maintenance, during
which, according to public announcement, the unit’s critical equipment – the main
circulating water pumps, turbine generators, and pipeline welding seams – had to
be inspected and repaired. The BelNPP did not release any information about the
defects identified during the works.

Available intelligence suggests that Belarus and Rosatom have withheld the information on the incidents that occurred in the BelNPP as well as the defects that were
identified in the systems of the reactors. In May 2022, BelNPP control systems of
Unit 1 detected cracks in the welding treads of the upper woodruff keys of the reactor
pressure vessel. Informally, experts assessed that in order to fix the defects properly,
it would be necessary to dismantle the reactor; however, such solution was not considered due to political reasons.

In addition, the launch of Unit 2, which was scheduled for 2022, was delayed due
to technical issues. Already in the beginning of 2022, in February, changes in the
chemical composition of the water circulating in the reactor’s primary circuit were
identified – the water was contaminated with resin. It was imperative to clean the pipes
of the primary circuit mechanically and unload the nuclear fuel assemblies. The nuclear
fuel assemblies were unloaded, cleaned, some of them had to be replaced with the
new ones. It is highly likely that new technical defects will continue to be detected in
the BelNPP even after the launch of Unit 2.

Rosatom has an ambition to expand its foreign operations and increase dependence on
its technologies; however, the example of the BelNPP and the threats it poses shows
that Rosatom is unable to ensure reliability and safety of its technologies.

##### CRISIS REGIONS

�The number of undernourished people in the world will increase
in the near term. Some regions are at risk of famine.

�Armed conflicts, including the war in Ukraine, growing food
prices, climate change, and COVID-19 pandemic exacerbate
the food crisis.

�People constantly threatened by hunger radicalise easier and
are a recruitment target for various radical groups. Migration of vulnerable individuals can be used by hostile anti-Western regimes
as a hybrid warfare tool or exploited by terrorist organizations.

**Conflicts and climate change deepen the global**
**food crisis**

The world is facing one of the most serious food crises over the last decades. The main
factors behind it are armed conflicts, including the Russian war in Ukraine, COVID-19,
climate change, and the ongoing political instability in many parts of the world. Currently, around 2.3 billion people are moderately or severely food insecure. 700-800
million of them (one out of ten) are starving or find themselves on the brink of famine
with an absolute majority living in two regions: Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

Armed conflict is the dominant factor as about 60 percent of the world’s population
that face chronic food insecurity live in countries affected by it. Due to war, agricultural and grazing lands are decreasing every year. Conflict constantly disrupts or
completely halts production, processing, transportation, and sales of agriculture
produce. Humanitarian aid, which in some cases can be the sole source of food,
becomes a weapon in the hands of warlords and dictators alike. Somalian jihadist
group Al Shabaab, the Syrian regime, and various militant groups in Sahel are but
a few examples of malevolent actors blocking or manipulating the distribution of
humanitarian aid or even destroying it.

Both local and major conflicts often have global repercussions for the hunger problem. Ongoing Russian war in Ukraine is one such example. The conflict itself and the
adjoining issues (sanctions, disruption of grain exports, rising prices of energy, etc.)
have caused food prices to rise worldwide. Twenty-six countries, mostly in Africa and
Asia, were particularly affected as they used to import at least half of their consumed
wheat from Ukraine and Russia. Available data suggest that in 2022, the number
of people facing severe food insecurity increased by 7.6–13 million due to Russian
aggression in Ukraine alone.

Climate change is another important issue threatening the global food supply.
Natural disasters strike different parts of the world with long lasting effects. The
droughts are getting longer and more frequent with around half of them occurring
in Africa. Many countries in Africa and Asia suffer from lack of safe drinking water.


-----

Devastating floods cause billions of dollars in damage; meanwhile, rising sea level
threatens coastal communities. Within the next 30 years, climate change could force
at least 200 million people to leave their homes.

Food shortage and interconnected poverty are a threat to hundreds of millions of lives.
Firstly, people constantly threatened by hunger, especially young males, are an easier
recruitment target for various radical groups, such as Islamic State, Al Qaeda, and
their regional affiliates. Additionally, migration flows of vulnerable individuals can be
used by hostile anti-Western regimes as a hybrid warfare tool or exploited by terrorist
organisations to facilitate movement of their members.

their homes and look for shelter in refugee camps

##### TERRORISM AND MIGRATION

�The threat of terrorism in Lithuania is low; however, the risk of
terrorism-related offences by lone radicalised individuals remains.

�The number of terrorist attacks in Europe has decreased,
but the threat of terrorism remains high. The threat of attacks
is posed by lone individuals affected by propaganda of terrorist
organisations.

�Proponents of right-wing extremism and accelerationism
ideology pose terrorist and criminal threats in Europe. Several
dozen individuals who actively promote this ideology operate in
Lithuania.

�Belarus continues to use migration as a tool of political pressure against the EU. It is possible that among illegal migrants
trying to enter Lithuania there are individuals who pose a threat
to national security or public order.

**The number of Islamist terrorist attacks in**
**Europe has decreased, but the threat remains**
**high**

International terrorist organisations the Islamic State and Al Qaeda and their branches
operate in the Middle East and Africa, disseminate anti-Western propaganda online
but have no capabilities to organise terrorist attacks in Europe. Planners and perpetrators of attacks in Europe are individuals who support Islamist ideology but are with
no direct associations with terrorist organisations. Most of them are young individuals
radicalised online. They usually have no access to firearms or explosives and choose
readily available means for their attacks such as vehicles and household items, like
knives or axes.

The number of Islamist terrorist attacks in Europe has been falling: in 2022, three terrorist attacks were carried out in France, Norway, and Belgium; several were thwarted.
Police officers and people in mass gatherings remain the main terrorist targets. One
terrorist attack was perpetrated in a prison. It was established that some perpetrators
suffered from mental illnesses.

In the near term, the threat of Islamist ideology-inspired attacks in Europe will remain
high. Anti-Christian, anti-Jewish, and anti-LGBT propaganda disseminated via social
media by terrorist groups or their supporters fuels radicalised individuals' determination to carry out terrorist attacks. The propaganda messages suggest targeting
synagogues, churches, mass events as well as police officers and the military. Revenge
for alleged insults to Islam and its symbols is a driving motive behind attacks carried
out by Islamist extremists.

In Lithuania, the threat of Islamist terrorism is low. Even though some individuals
possibly affected by Islamist ideology are identified every year, the level of their
radicalisation remains low. Apart from a few individual cases, no organised flow of
individuals with radical views from third countries to Lithuania or to the EU via Lithuania
has been identified. In the near term, it is unlikely that Lithuania will become a target
for Islamist terrorists; however, the cases of terrorism funding, spread of propaganda,
or even carrying out an attack are possible in the country.

**Right-wing extremism and accelerationism remain**
**a threat in Europe**

Followers of right-wing extremist accelerationism ideology pose terrorist and other
criminal threats in Europe. In 2022, an extremist opened fire in an LGBT community
bar in Bratislava, killing two people and injuring one. The perpetrator was soon found
having committed suicide. Several more terrorist attacks planned by accelerationists
in Europe were thwarted.

Social networks and popular social gaming platforms remain the main tools to spread
accelerationist propaganda. It manages to radicalise mainly young individuals with
good IT skills. Availability of 3D printers and chemical laboratory equipment, which
has increased over the past few years, enables accelerationists to make weapons
and explosives more easily.

There have been no indications of plans of the ideology supporters in Lithuania to
carry out a terrorist attack; however, the risk remains. Several dozen individuals in
Lithuania who actively promote accelerationist ideas via social networks maintain
contacts with like-minded individuals abroad. Lithuanian citizens permanently based
in other European countries also become radicalised and get involved in this activity.

**Illegal immigrants to the EU are still using**
**the route via Belarus**

Western Europe remains an attractive destination for illegal economic migrants.
The migration route from Belarus to the EU via Lithuania, Poland, and Latvia has
become one of the routes for reaching Europe illegally. Migrants made more than
11,200 attempts to cross the Belarusian–Lithuanian border last year. Among the
illegal immigrants who entered Lithuania, some were suspected of ties with terrorist
organisations. For most migrants, Lithuania remains a transit country, and most of

them highly likely present their asylum requests only as a pretext for entering the
EU territory. Out of more than 4,000 registered migrants in the country, 141 person
were granted international protection.

Some migrants arrive in Belarus from their countries of origin via Russia. Not only
human traffickers and smugglers but also Belarusian border officers organise and
facilitate illegal migration. They deliberately help migrants to cross the Belarusian–Lithuanian border – transport them, damage the physical barrier, and push the migrants
into Lithuanian territory. In case of failure to enter Lithuanian territory, Belarusian
border guards transport the migrants to the Latvian or Polish border and try to force
them to cross it there.

In 2022, the Belarusian regime failed to repeat the previously orchestrated migration
crisis at the EU borders on a similar scale as in 2021. However, it is highly likely that
the regime is interested in maintaining constant political pressure on Europe. Due to
the actions of the Minsk regime, the route via Belarus has become one of the illegal
migration routes to the EU, and it will continue to be used by third-country nationals
seeking to enter the EU illegally.

It is highly likely that the threat of illegal migration from Belarus will remain in the medium
term. It is possible that among migrants using this route to enter Lithuania and other
EU countries, there will be individuals associated with extremist organisations and
posing a threat to national security or public order.

Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and in particular
tools that replicate and elaborate on human knowledge
are the most interesting and controversial. Midjourney, AI
empowered image generator, was a creative tool behind
the production of the cover of this year's National Threat
Assessment. It features an image that portrays a joint
interpretation of Lithuanian intelligence and AI of Russia’s
war against Ukraine.

The blooming sunflower, which is Ukraine’s national flower,
symbolises peace, resilience, courage, and victory of the
Ukrainians, while the smoke in the background represents
the war that will never break the unity and hope of the
