## Introduction

###### Norway and our allies face a new and deteri­ orating security situation. Norwegian security and defence policy must take into account an
­international environment characterised by more
overt and covert competition and rivalry. ­Ongoing
changes in our strategic surroundings will have
###### direct and indirect effects across all sectors of
society.

###### Norway is currently better suited to address
emerging threats and challenges, due to decisions
made in the previous Long Term Plan. However,
the threats are more serious and the deterioration
of the security environment is happening faster
than previously assumed. Further investment in
defence and security is needed to safeguard our
freedom, way of life, values and interests.

###### Increasing threats, challenges and vulnerabili­
ties must be met by active policies, priorities and
###### measures. Investment in defence and security
remains a key priority for the Norwegian Govern­
ment. The Norwegian Armed Forces contribute
###### to national and regional deterrence and reas­ surance. Challenges must be met by a strong national joint force, in a NATO framework, to­
gether with close allies.

###### The complexity of threats and risks requires stronger and more flexible civil-military coope­ ration. We will continue to build resilience and civil prepared­ness in order to strengthen the
­ability of the ­nation to withstand and recover from
­attacks and incidents. The defence of Norway is

###### The comprehensive approach to Norwegian

­security is detailed as follows:

National defence
Due to our geostrategic location, Norway has con­
siderable responsibility at the northern flank of
the Alliance. To meet this responsibility, ­Norway
must maintain a present national military force,
###### as well as significant surveillance and intelli­
gence resources. There is an increased ­demand
###### for ­national forces and capabilities to conduct
­operations both at home and abroad. The ­activity
and presence of our forces contributes to deter­
###### rence and reassurance, ensures national influ­
ence in our surrounding areas, and contributes
to Norway remaining a relevant partner to allies
and partners.

NATO's collective defence
NATO and the transatlantic security community
remains the cornerstone of Norwegian security
###### and defence policy. Collective security through deterrence and defence is the most important
task of the Alliance. NATO defence and reinforce­
ment plans have been updated in recent years
###### and their credibility require strong and lasting
commitment from allies through relevant capa­
###### bilities, training and political support. All allies
must increase their efforts in order to strengthen
both national and collective security.


Bilateral support and reinforcement
Norway is dependent on bilateral reinforcement
###### agreements and cooperation with close allies in crisis and armed conflict. Building security
with allies requires close cooperation throughout
peacetime, crisis and armed conflict.

###### Due to our geostrategic location, Norway has considerable responsibility at the northern flank of the Alliance.

## Key challenges  and trends

Norwegian defence and security policy aims to
safeguard the security of our nation and is con­
###### tinuously adapted to meet current and future
changes to the strategic environment.

**A NEW SECURITY SITUATION**

The strategic environment is characterised by rapid
change, increased unpredictability and uncertainty.
The challenges to our national security are becom­ **›**
ing more complex. The negative security outlook
presented in the previous Long Term Plan in 2016
has not only prevailed, it has accelerated and tak­
en an even more serious turn. If we fail to address
it, the new security situation has the potential to
affect and limit our freedom of action, our ability
###### to protect national interests and to maintain in­
fluence in our areas of interest.

Great power competition and the increased stra­
###### tegic importance of the High North has impli­
cations for Norwegian security. An increasingly
###### demanding and unstable strategic landscape, ›
where the rule-based order is challenged and the
use of instruments of power is more prevalent,
threatens to marginalise the security of smaller
states such as Norway.

**Five key drivers characterise the**
**new security situation:**

###### › Great power rivalry creates a more ­unstable
world and increases the risk of conflict. ­Central
actors, such as China and Russia, use a broad
###### range of state power to achieve strategic,
­political, economic and military objectives. This
###### dynamic has a destabilising effect. The domi­
nating role of the West is changing as the ­global **›**
power shift towards Asia continues. In the com­


-----

The combination of credible deterrence and reas­
surance across the full spectrum of peace, crisis
and armed conflict is becoming more important,
and more demanding. Nations will be put to the
test by their ability to foster measured and strong
responses to various kinds of aggression where
###### more instruments of power are in play. In this environment, it can be challenging to separate
state security threats from societal risks. It may
become more difficult to deter and defend against
acts of aggression below the threshold of armed
conflict, be it in the digital sphere, and by influence
­operations from both state and non-state actors.

**THE STRATEGIC CONTEXT**
Emerging and disruptive technologies are already
###### affecting our economies and societies and are


Melting of the polar ice is of particular ­significance
for Norway. The melting of the ice opens the High
North up to increased civilian, ­commercial and
military activity. The increasing effect of ­climate
###### change in the region will only add up to and ­accelerate the renewed strategic importance
of the region.

# 3 The UN Sustainable
###### ­Development Goals – ­Implications for the ­Defence Sector


The Defence Sector has adopted meas­
ures that are relevant for the fulfillment
of the UN Sustainable Development
Goals. Failure to reach these goals may
increase the risk of armed conflict.

Climate change is often referred to as
a threat multiplier, and can both create
and intensify conflicts. The ­defence
sector will implement well-­targeted
measures to reduce the negative
­effects on the environment.

The Armed Forces place strict demands
on suppliers of infrastructure and
­materiel, to keep the carbon footprint
as low as possible, and to ensure that
they adhere to current standards and
regulations concerning ethical trade
and labour standards.

Good governance, integrity and anti-­
corruption are important ­sustainable
development goals from a defence
perspective. The Armed Forces will
­conduct their activities in a way that
meets a number of standards, the
most important being: absence of
corruption; responsibility; respect
for human rights; equality; openness
and access to information from ­public
­institutions. Good governance is thus
an integral part of the Norwegian
­security and defence policy.

## Addressing  the challenges


# 4


###### This Long Term Plan introduces measures to ­ensure that the Norwegian Armed Forces
­remain relevant, robust and adaptable in order
###### to ­address both current and future challenges. A ­continued ­increase in ­defence spending will
­reduce ­operational ­capability gaps and strengthen
the readiness and endurance of the Armed Forces.

**INCREASING COMBAT POWER AND**
**REDUCING OPERATIONAL GAPS**
Norway recognises our responsibility to improve
###### the collective defence capability. Long-range ­precision weapons, threats across traditional lines, rapid technological advances and agreed
capability targets among allies are all factors that
point towards a need to develop the Armed ­Forces.
###### Increasing our national defence and increased contributions internationally contribute to our
common NATO deterrence and defence efforts.
###### The Norwegian Armed Forces will continue to strengthen their ­efforts across all domains in order to address a new and unstable security
environment that challenges both regional and
global security.

###### This plan builds on the strategic choices made
in the previous plan. It will improve the ­national
­capability and enhance the ability to receive ­allied
reinforcements and to deploy forces to ­operations
abroad. In the coming years, the Armed Forces will
introduce a number of new capacities and ­begin
###### several major upgrades of existing ­capacities
and platforms in order to ensure technical and
­operational relevance. The ­introduction of new
###### weapon ­systems and the upgrade of ­existing
systems will enhance the combat ­power of the
Armed Forces in the long-term. In addition, it will


reduce gaps in ­existing operational plans and in
###### ­NATO's ­capability ­targets for Norway. ­Norway will also enhance the ­ability to ­synchronise ­strategic information operations, electronic
warfare as well as Joint targeting ­procedures at
the ­Headquarters. A more robust structure with
­relevant ­capabilities, ­readiness and sustainability
will ­provide a ­necessary foundation for defending
Norwegian sovereignty and rights.

###### The Norwegian Armed Forces will continue to strengthen their efforts across all domains in order to address a new and unstable security environment that challenges both regional and global security.


-----

# 4


**Army**
Norway will continue to develop the Army. This
###### implies increased firepower, higher readiness
and increased sustainability. Brigade North will
###### be ­developed with four manoeuvre battalions and with tactical and logistical support. The
­manoeuvre battalions will be equipped with new
main battle tanks, mobile air defence systems and
###### long-range precisions fire. This will ensure that
the Norwegian Army Forces remain relevant in
the new security environment.

**Navy**
Norway will strengthen the Navy with increased
personnel volume. This will improve the robust­
ness of operational crews, and provide improved
###### readiness and sustainability. The frigates and submarines will undergo necessary upgrades.
­In addition, three new Coast Guard vessels will
be introduced in the period 2021-2025. Planning
###### of the replacement of surface vessels in order
to preserve the maritime ­operational ­capability
###### after 2030 will start, and decisions ­concerning type and number of vessels will be made in the next ­planning period. It is our ­ambition to
­acquire and implement future Navy capabilities
in ­collaboration with close allies. The submarines
will be replaced with a new platform in coopera­
tion between Norway and Germany around 2030.

**Air Force**
The implementation of the F-35 Lightning II con­
tinues. P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft will
replace the fleet of P-3 Orion. The introduction
of new aircraft systems will have priority for the
Air Force during the years leading up to 2025. To
improve air defence capability, the NASAMS II air


defence systems will be upgraded with modern
sensors as well as the introduction of a comple­
###### mentary capacity with shorter range. This will contribute to countering threats against ­bases, and protect allied reception areas and other ­vital infrastructure. In the long term, it will be assessed how long-range air defence systems
can be ­introduced.

**Special Forces**
The ability of the Special Forces to contribute to
###### both national and international operations will
improve with increased personnel volume and
one additional special operations task group. The
###### Bell 412 transport helicopters will be replaced by a new capacity that is better suited for ­the
Special Forces.

###### In addition to these investments, the moderni­
sation of the Home Guard will continue, including
an increased capacity to forward stage ­weapons,
###### ammunition and other supplies. Norway will
also strengthen the national intelligence service,
###### ­increase investments to ensure the continued modernisation of the overall joint forces and
­improve host nation support capabilities.

**STRENGTHENED ALLIED DIMENSION**
Norwegian security and the defence of Norway
is reliant upon the collective defence capabilities
in NATO, along with longstanding reinforcement
###### cooperation with close allies. Norway remains
committed to supporting the ongoing adaptation
in the Alliance. The defence of Norway starts out­
side our territorial borders and Norwegian partici­
pation in NATO operations and readiness forces
is an integral part of the overall defence effort.

The strengthening of NATO's maritime posture is
an integral element of the ongoing adaptation of
the Alliance and crucial to Norwegian and allied
security. The security of the Sea Lines of Commu­
nication across the Atlantic is critical, in order to
###### reinforce Europe in crisis and conflict. Norway
plays an important role in NATO by operating in
###### and monitoring the Arctic region, by providing
situational awareness to the transatlantic security
community. A continued and credible Norwegian
military presence in the north is a contribution to
regional stability and to allied security.

Allied presence, training and exercises in and close
###### to Norway and reinforcement plans for the de­
fence of Norway are of fundamental importance.
###### Norwegian freedom and security benefit from
close ties with key allies such as the USA, the UK,
the Netherlands and Germany. The ­Norwegian
###### Armed Forces continue to train and operate
with these and other units along with continued
­development of Norwegian host nation facilities.

**A MODERNISED TOTAL DEFENCE CONCEPT**
###### Our overall defence effort relies heavily on a whole-of-government approach. The strategic


###### ­environment necessitates an increased level of civil-­military cooperation to safeguard both ­societal and national security. The private and
public ­sectors need to work together to ­strengthen
­resilience towards existing and emerging threats.
Societal resilience is a key element in the defence
of Norway.

###### The defence of Norway starts outside our territorial borders and Norwegian participation in NATO operations and readiness forces is an integral part of the overall defence effort.

Civil-military cooperation will be further modern­
ised within the framework of the concept of Total
Defence. The modernised Total Defence concept
encompasses mutual support and cooperation
between the Norwegian Armed Forces and civil
society. This includes contingency planning, ­crisis
###### management and consequence management
across the entire crisis spectrum – from peace to
security policy crisis and armed conflict.

The principle of extensive civilian support to the
Norwegian Armed Forces in crisis and in war is
the core of the Total Defence concept. If neces­
sary, all national resources can be mobilised in the
defence of Norway. A modernised and ­prepared
Total Defence concept provides a whole-of-­society
###### approach to current security issues and builds

resilience and civil preparedness to counter com­
plex security challenges.

**CONTINUED FUNDING INCREASE**
Maintaining a balance between tasks, ambitions,
structure and economy is important to preserve
a sustainable development of the defence ­sector.
###### The Long Term Plan 2017–2020 established a solid foundation. The Government committed to long-term modernisation and development
of the ­defence sector and allocated ­considerable
###### defence spending. The new Long Term Plan
­recommends continuing along the agreed lines
from the previous plan. Similarly to the Long Term
Plan 2017–2020, this plan sees a mutual depend­
###### ence and balance between increased funding,
modernisation and reform. Modernisation and
reform are necessary and create a foundation for
increased spending on prioritised areas.

Several factors and conditions affect the imple­
mentation of a long-term defence plan and the
Norwegian defence budget. External factors such
as currency exposure when procuring new ma­
###### teriel in foreign currencies and the experience of high growth in unit costs in the sector pose
significant challenges to budgets and long-term
defence planning.

­chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear crisis

###### In this plan, the Government proposes an in­ crease in defence spending that will reach 2%
of GDP in 2028. This implies an increase of the
budget to a level in 2028 that is NOK 16.5 billion
above the agreed 2020 budget level. This builds on
the ­significant spending increase in the ­previous
Long Term Plan.

**EXPLOITATION OF TECHNOLOGY**
Strengthening the ability to exploit existing and
###### new technologies, originating from both the
­civilian and military sector, will be of key impor­
tance for the Norwegian defence sector. ­Digitally
###### competent soldiers, high levels of trust in the Norwegian society and the increasingly close
cooperation between the Armed Forces and the
civilian sector, represent comparative advantages
for Norway in exploiting technology.

Norway will strengthen the system for innovation
in the defence sector and adapt a comprehensive
approach to technology exploitation. To ­generate
###### new solutions and to reduce risk in capability development, Norway will increase the use of
concept development, experimentation, test and
evaluation. The defence sector will increasingly
###### consider commercial off-the-shelf solutions in
the capability development process.

In order to take advantage of technological develop­
ment in the civilian sector and to ­strengthen the
national knowledge base, the defence sector will
###### increase cooperation with academia and the
­business community. At the same time, Norway
will increase international cooperation regarding
###### development and procurement of capabilities

and solutions with selected European allies, the
­USA, the EU and within NATO.

**PERSONNEL AND RECRUITMENT**

The highly skilled and dedicated military and ­civilian
personnel that populate the defence ­sector are the
backbone of our force. The ­number of ­personnel
will gradually be increased in ­order to strengthen
the readiness and availability of the Armed Forces
and gradually generate ­enhanced combat power.
By adopting a more flexible ­personnel system, the
Armed Forces are better equipped to meet new
###### technological standards, as well as the require­
ments of new generations of jobseekers.

###### The current focus of personnel reforms is on
diversifying the personnel structure in order to
###### strengthen the capability and the ­readiness of
the Norwegian Armed Forces, and on the further
###### restructuring of the training and educational
­system. The Norwegian Armed Forces aim to be
a ­reliable and committed employer, and a good
partner to strategic cooperation and the business
­community. Strong partnerships ­provide ­potential
for increased mobility of personnel, competencies
###### and an efficient allocation of ­resources, which
benefits all parties.

As part of a more flexible personnel system, the
Norwegian Armed Forces will continue to develop
its gender-neutral compulsory military service and
the use of reserves. An increased use of qualified
conscripts and reserves, in addition to an increase
in employees, is critical to maintain a high oper­
ational capability towards complex, diverse and
unpredictable threats and risks.

## Closing comments

**MR. FRANK BAKKE-JENSEN**
**Minister of Defence**

Building on the priorities from the previous plan,
this Long Term Plan represents a further effort
to secure that the development of a ready and
relevant joint force continues. Robust and com­
###### prehensive force development takes time. Sus­
tainable modernisation demands a combination
of predictability and flexibility. It is a priority to
the Government that our Armed Forces are devel­
oped in a way that facilitates further strengthening
###### in the years to come and provides a force rele­
vant to allies and existing and future challenges.

Protecting our sovereignty, territorial ­integrity,
­democracy and freedom of action comes at a
cost. The Government continues to invest ­heavily
in ­defence and security, to ensure that Norway


­remains a reliable ally and a responsible and ­capable
partner on the northern flank of the ­Alliance. This
plan details a budget increase in the coming years
moving Norwegian defence spending to reach the
2% goal in 2028. It is important that these funds are
put to use in the most efficient way. We will there­
fore continue the work of identi­fying cost effective
solutions wherever possible, both when conducting
daily activities and when acquiring new equipment.

###### A challenging strategic environment constantly reminds us that our freedom and security can
not be taken for granted. Norway will continue to
take responsibility for our national security in the
years to come. With this Long Term Plan, Norway
has taken further important steps in ­order to be
better equipped to meet a constantly changing
security situation.


###### The Government continues to invest heavily in the Armed Forces, to ensure that Norway remains a reliable ally and a responsible and capable partner on the northern flank of the Alliance.
