#### Foreword by the Secretary of State for Defence
 the Right Honourable Geoff Hoon MP

Throughout this Government’s time in office, the UK’s Armed Forces have consistently
risen to the challenges set them, continuing a military tradition of which the whole nation
can be proud. This success is no accident. It depends on the ability of our people,
properly trained, motivated and equipped, focussed and organised on achieving results
and directed by outstanding leaders throughout the chain of command. The British
people expect the Government to continue to deliver high quality Armed Forces capable of
responding to the uncertainties and threats of today’s security environment, and to ensure
our Service men and women receive the level of support they need. This White Paper
sets out the policy for doing so, building on the expeditionary strategy first set out in the
Strategic Defence Review (SDR) in 1998 and the conclusions reached in the SDR New
Chapter in 2002, and adapted to reflect operational experience and the changing security
environment.

The Paper sets out our analysis of the future security environment, the implications

for defence, and how we intend adapting our planning and force structures to meet
the potential threats. While many of the conclusions reached in the SDR remain valid,
the threats posed by international terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction are starker, as are the risks to wider security posed by failed or failing states.
Whereas in the past it was possible to regard military force as a separate element in crisis
resolution, it is now evident that the successful management of international security
problems will require ever more integrated planning of military, diplomatic and economic
instruments at both national and international levels. We have also had to look at how
we can best take advantage of the opportunities offered by new technologies to deliver
military effects in different ways. Our focus is now on delivering flexible forces able
to configure to generate the right capability in a less predictable and more complex
operational environment. This will require us to move away from simplistic platform-centric
planning, to a fully “networked enabled capability” able to exploit effects-based planning
and operations, using forces which are truly adaptable, capable of even greater levels of
precision and rapidly deployable.  This implies significant changes in the way we plan,
prepare and execute operations, placing different pressures and demands on our people,
equipment, supporting infrastructure and processes.

For these reasons we must be prepared to invest in recruiting and retaining the

right people, providing them with the necessary training, development and support. We
must invest in the battle-winning equipment they will need and continue to modernise
the rest of Defence to effectively support expeditionary operations. Resources must be
directed at those capabilities that best deliver the range of effects required, while we
must have the determination to dispense with those capabilities that do not. We expect
to be in a position to announce significant changes to the current and future capabilities
of the Armed Forces and supporting infrastructure next year. These will be considered in
the continuing work to establish the nature of a sustainable and affordable future force
structure. This White Paper presents the security and policy baseline against which future
decisions will be made and gives a clear statement of our future strategic priorities.

A separate publication on Operation TELIC is being published in parallel with this

White Paper. We have not yet drawn complete conclusions of the implications on lessons
on the operations in Iraq for capability. These will be considered in the continuing work to
rebalance the Defence programme.

A separate volume of detailed supporting essays and analysis covers the core topics

of International Organisations; Military Tasks and Scales of Effort; Reserves; Defence
Relations; People; Defence Management; and Industrial Policy.

# Chapter 1

#### Setting the Scene


1.1 The Balkans, Sierra Leone,

Afghanistan, and Iraq demonstrate the
successful performance of British forces
in conducting both combat operations
and subsequent stabilisation operations.
The rapid deployment of some 46,000
personnel to the Gulf confirmed the
validity of the vision set out in the
Strategic Defence Review (SDR) in 1998
and the expeditionary strategy and
modernisation initiated by the Review.

1.2 The SDR was a fundamental

rethink of how the UK Armed Forces and
their supporting infrastructure should
be structured to face the challenges
of the increasingly complex security
environment which followed the ending
of the Cold War and the emergence of
uncertainty and instability in many areas
of the world.  The key conclusions from
the Review were:

- Defence is an essential part of

achieving the Government’s wider
Foreign and Security Policy objectives
both through military operations and
Defence Diplomacy;

- The need for modern and effective

armed forces equipped and
supported for rapid and sustainable
deployment on expeditionary
operations, usually as part of a
coalition;

- The largest operation envisaged

was a regional conflict, although
a requirement to retain the basis
on which to reconstitute larger
capabilities in the event of a reemerged strategic threat to NATO
remained;



- Our forces need to be prepared to

conduct the full range of operations
from warfighting through to peace
support operations;

- Military effectiveness would be

enhanced through increased
“Jointery” between the Services,
including the establishment of a
Chief of Defence Logistics, and most
importantly through the creation of the
Joint Rapid Reaction Force;

- The supporting infrastructure and

services within the MOD needed
to be modernised and rationalised
to support expeditionary warfare
effectively;

- The role of the Reserve Forces should

be further adapted to meet the
military demands of the post-Cold
War world;

- We should harness new technologies

to enhance military capability while
preparing to counter new threats;

- We should maintain a minimum

nuclear deterrent based on the Trident
system.

1.3 The Review set the policy

framework through which we have
operated since 1998. A succession of
operations has demonstrated our ability
to plan, deploy, operate and sustain
forces over considerable distances,
alongside a diverse range of allies and
partners.


1.4 However, the world has not stood

still and since the SDR there has been a
series of significant developments:

- More numerous crises of a wider

range and in a wider geographical
area – Kosovo, Macedonia, Sierra
Leone, East Timor, Afghanistan,
Democratic Republic of Congo, as
well as Iraq – have demonstrated that
the global security environment is
more uncertain than it was five years
ago and our Armed Forces face an
even broader range, frequency, and
often duration of tasks than envisaged
in 1998;

- The increased threat from

international terrorism, requiring a
response both at home and overseas;

- NATO’s enlargement and evolution

from large static forces to smaller
response forces, able to undertake
operations beyond the NATO area
itself;


-----

- The emergence of European Security

and Defence Policy (ESDP) and its
first operations;

- The beginnings of a strategic

relationship with Russia (although
many dimension of this have yet to
develop);

- More widespread proliferation of

Weapons of Mass Destruction[1] (WMD)
and related technologies; and

- The development of new concepts

and technologies including Network
Enabled Capability (NEC)[2] and the
widespread availability of precision
weapons.


1.5 Following the September 11

attacks, the MOD reviewed its ability
to respond to the particular challenges
raised by international terrorism. The
SDR New Chapter concluded that
our emphasis on expeditionary forces
enabled the UK to have a key role in
the new international environment but
recognised that operations against
international terrorism required
increased precision and rapid delivery
of military effect, particularly through
NEC.  The New Chapter highlighted the
need to be prepared to prevent, deter,
coerce, disrupt or destroy international
terrorists or the regimes that harbour
them and to counter terrorists’ efforts to
acquire chemical, biological, radiological
and nuclear weapons. It recognised
the role of stabilisation operations and
Defence Diplomacy in addressing the
causes and symptoms of conflict and
terrorism. The New Chapter noted
the increased likelihood of deploying
forces outside the SDR core regions
of Europe, the Middle East and the
Mediterranean more often and alongside
coalition partners.  These conclusions
had particular implications for future
capability, especially expeditionary
logistics. More frequent, and often
longer and/or smaller operations require
particular key enablers within the force
structure, including communications,
logistics, medical specialists, and
intelligence. While centred on the need
to confront international terrorism
abroad rather than waiting for attacks
within the UK, the New Chapter also
recognised the valuable contribution
Defence could make to Home defence
and security in support of the Home
Office and civil authorities.


1.6 As well as helping to sustain

relative peace in Northern Ireland ahead
of a final settlement, Defence has also
played an important role in supporting
the civil authorities in responding to
a range of civil contingencies. The
availability of a pool of highly trained
service personnel, combined with
expertise in crisis management, planning
and command and control, has seen
the Armed Forces deployed to support
civil authorities during the fuel dispute,
foot and mouth outbreaks, flooding and
most recently on Operation FRESCO
during the fire services’ pay dispute.
The Armed Forces’ performance was
widely praised, but there was inevitably
an impact on personnel and the
training and preparedness of units for
their operational roles, particularly as
Operation FRESCO coincided with the
start of the campaign in Iraq.

1.7 While the SDR and the New

Chapter set us on the right course to
respond to the trends emerging in 1998,
the security environment and technology
have moved on. We therefore need
to adapt further our force structures in
light of our operational experience and
continue the process of modernisation
that SDR set in hand.


_1 The phrase ‘weapons of mass destruction’ is generally held to refer to nuclear, chemical and biological weapons._

_2 NEC has evolved as the UK’s term for the capability enhancement achieved through the effective linkage of platforms and_
_people through a network. It replaces the expression Network Centric Capability used in the SDR New Chapter. NEC is explored_
_in more detail in Chapter 4._

# Chapter 2

#### The Security Challenge


**UK Policy Aims**

2.1 The security and stability of Europe

and the maintenance of the transatlantic
relationship remain fundamental to
our security and defence policy. The
UK is a permanent member of the UN
Security Council and a leading military
contributor to the NATO Alliance and the
ESDP. More widely the UK has a range
of global interests including economic
well-being based around trade, overseas
and foreign investment, and the
continuing free flow of natural resources.
We have responsibilities for 13 overseas
territories. Our security and national
prosperity depend upon international
stability, freedom and economic
development, and in support of these
the UK seeks to act as a force for good
within the international community. The
capacity to deliver effective military
force in peace support and intervention
operations, alongside our EU and
NATO allies, is a vital component of our
security policy.

2.2 The Government’s security

priorities, set out in the SDR and the
New Chapter are summarised in our
Defence Aim:

**To deliver security for the people**
**of the United Kingdom and the**
**Overseas Territories by defending**
**them, including against terrorism;**
**and to act as a force for good by**
**strengthening international peace**
**and stability.**


**Security Environment**

2.3 International terrorism and the

proliferation of WMD represent the most
direct threats to our peace and security.
But, working with Other Government
Departments, we need also to consider
and address the underlying causes of
these threats.

**International Terrorism**

2.4 The terrorist attacks of 11

September 2001 demonstrate the
strategic effect that a sophisticated
and determined group of terrorists can
achieve. As well as confronting the threat
directly, we are working with our partners
to tackle the conditions that promote
terrorism and provide ready recruits and
to deny terrorists funding and freedom
of movement. We supported action in
the UN to tackle terrorist finances and to
share intelligence more widely between
many nations.

2.5 The US-led coalition operations in

Afghanistan succeeded in overthrowing
the Taliban regime, which had provided
a safe haven for Al Qaida. The coalition
destroyed Al Qaida’s training camps and
disrupted its leadership. More broadly,
world-wide action by law enforcement
and intelligence agencies has further
pursued Al Qaida’s leaders and has
successfully diminished its expertise
and capability. Nonetheless, Al Qaida
remains a sophisticated, if loosely-linked,
movement which operates at many
different levels. It has not recreated the
infrastructure it had in Afghanistan but
it has considerable resilience through a
number of widespread, covert networks
that support its activities. It has made a
number of attacks since 11 September
and retains the intent and the capability
to pose a direct threat to the UK and to
British citizens. It has also stimulated
other Islamist extremists to attack
Western interests around the world.


2.6 We also know, for example from

documentary evidence recovered from
Afghanistan and arrests this year in France
and the UK, that international terrorists
are seeking to use chemical, biological
and radiological means to enhance their
capacity for disruption and destruction.
Whilst arrests of senior figures and cell
members will have hindered their efforts,
their aspirations remain.

**Proliferation of Weapons of Mass**
**Destruction**

2.7 Continuing proliferation of WMD

provides another pressing cause for
concern. Some states will continue to
seek WMD, particularly as access to the
technology and production becomes
easier. The means of delivering such
weapons are also being proliferated, as
we have seen with missile technology
transfers from North Korea to a number
of states. The international community’s
response to such proliferation,
particularly of nuclear weapons,
must be firm. We do not believe
the world community should accept
the acquisition of nuclear weapons
by further states. Preventing the
potential passage of WMD knowledge
or weapons from states to terrorist
groups is also a key part of the counterproliferation challenge.


-----

**Failing States**

2.8 Weak and failing states are an

increasing problem for the stability
of several regions especially on
NATO’s borders and in Africa. Such
states are characterised by political
mismanagement, ethnic and religious
tensions or economic collapse. They
can contain areas of ungoverned
territory which provide potential havens
and sources of support for terrorist
groups and criminal networks involved
in drugs production or the plundering
of natural resources. Neighbouring
states may be drawn into competition
for control or influence over these
territories and their resources. Internal
conflict, poverty, human rights abuse
and famine can all create the conditions
for mass population movements, adding
to pressures on neighbouring countries
or emerging as a surge in migration to
Europe.

**Social and Environmental Factors**

2.9 As the world’s population

continues to grow (particularly in North
Africa, the Middle East, Latin America
and much of Asia), demographic
pressures will have more of an impact
on international security. Religious and
ethnic tensions, environmental pressures
and increased competition for limited
natural resources may cause tensions
and conflict – both within and between
states.  The UK may not remain
immune from such developments;
regional disputes can swiftly become
internationalised, and may have a major
impact on the global economy, energy
security, and our allies and partners.

**Regional Analysis**

2.10 The UK will engage proactively
in shaping the international response
to events that impact on our security
interests, as well as more broadly
fostering international peace and
security. But we do not have, or
seek, the defence capacity for military
responses to each and every risk or
crisis. National interest, proximity and
responsibility will be among the key
factors in determining what, if any, role
the UK’s Armed Forces should plan to
have in dealing with any crisis.


2.11 The SDR judgement that European
security is central to our national
interests has not changed. The shadow
of the Cold War has gone from Europe;
NATO and Russia are developing a
close working relationship, with their
armed forces having deployed alongside
each other in the Balkans. There is
currently no major conventional threat
to Europe, but asymmetric forms of
attack, including from international
terrorism, pose a very real threat to our
homelands. Such threats, along with
the proliferation of WMD, are global. We
must tackle them assertively at source
– wherever that might be – or in transit,
using the wide range of tools available
to us (political, economic and military).
We must also be able to manage the
consequences of attacks at home. This
approach is reflected in our support
for the proposed solidarity clause in
the draft new European Treaty which
provides that the Union will mobilise all
the instruments at its disposal (including
the military resources made available
by member states) in response to the
request of a member state that has
fallen victim to a terrorist attack or
natural or man-made disaster, as well as
in our strong commitment to deal with
these new threats alongside the US and
our other international partners.

2.12 The second enduring SDR
judgement was that Europe and those
regions immediately adjacent – the Near
East, North Africa and the Gulf – are
likely to continue to have the most
significant bearing on both our own
and wider Western security interests.
Potentially destabilising social, political,
and economic problems demand
proactive engagement in conflict
prevention, as well as the capacity to
respond quickly to emerging crises.

2.13 The Middle East presents the most
significant security challenges within
this broad area. The Israeli/Palestinian
problem is a fundamental issue
and the UK will continue to support
international efforts to secure a lasting
settlement. The Gulf will remain a region
of considerable strategic importance,
with its energy supplies being crucial
to the world economy. Although recent
operations in Iraq have neutralised
one threat and will continue to have a
deterrent effect on others, WMD have
proliferated across some countries in the
Middle East and beyond and are likely to
remain a continuing concern.


2.14 Looking beyond the regions
adjacent to Europe, we now need to
take a greater account in our planning of
a high likelihood of commitments further
afield. The threat from international
terrorism now requires the capability
to deliver a military response globally.
Other crises could also occur anywhere
across the world but the UK will not be
able, nor required, to become involved
in every case. For planning purposes,
we will as a force focus on those areas
where we have strong historical ties and
responsibilities.

2.15 Sub-Saharan Africa is a povertystricken and unstable region. The
conditions that exist are likely to
perpetuate a situation of recurring
humanitarian disasters. As Sierra Leone
has illustrated, there is a political and
moral desire to assist in ameliorating
the worst atrocities and encouraging,
with the EU and other partners, good
governance and security sector reform
to set the conditions for security in the
region. Instability in parts of South
Asia may require a significant level of
engagement.

**International Organisations**

2.16 The UK’s national security and
economic interests are best protected
through working closely with other
members of the international community.
While Iraq exposed differing views within
the UN Security Council, NATO and
the EU over the handling of that crisis,
it does not undermine our continued
commitment to the development of
these organisations. But we also need
the flexibility to build coalitions of the
willing to deal with specific threats when
necessary.


-----

##### g y g g
 Defence White Paper


2.17 The UN will remain the forum
through which the international
community will debate the handling of
major security crises, reinforcing the
UK’s key responsibilities as a permanent
member of the Security Council. We
will therefore seek to foster a strong
Council, and support efforts to improve
the UN’s performance in peace support
operations. However, we need to be
realistic about the limitations of the
UN and the difficulties of translating
broad consensus on goals into specific
actions, particularly where proactive
military intervention is concerned.


2.18 The UK recognises the preeminence of NATO as the alliance
upon which Europe and North America
depends for collective defence and
global crisis management. Since the
SDR was published, the Alliance has
continued to adapt. It will soon expand
its membership to 26 and has developed
a working relationship with Russia.
NATO’s recently assumed command of
the International Security Assistance
Force in Afghanistan has demonstrated
the Alliance’s willingness to undertake
tasks outside its traditional areas of
concern. The challenge now facing
the Alliance is to deliver the capabilities
and structures required for effective
crisis management and expeditionary
forces. The Prague Summit in 2002
set in hand a number of initiatives
designed to generate the necessary
capabilities, including the creation of
smaller and more flexible command
structures and the NATO Response
Force. A new functional command, the
Allied Command for Transformation,
has taken responsibility for promoting
and overseeing the transformation of
Alliance forces and capabilities. The
catalyst for this capability development
will be the NATO Response Force, with
its emphasis on flexible, deployable,
technologically advanced and
interoperable forces; nations must now
deliver the credible capabilities required
to make this a reality.


2.19 The UK is a strong supporter
of developing EU military capability
to complement NATO, rather than
competing with it. The EU, with its
focus on crisis management operations
outside the Union, has now established
an operational Common Security
and Defence Policy and the military
structures required to support it, though
significant shortfalls remain to be met
before the Helsinki Headline Goal is
achieved in full.  Arrangements known
as ‘Berlin Plus’ provide for the use of
NATO planning resources and other
assets if these are required for their
operations. The EU through ESDP
has conducted limited peace support
operations in both Macedonia and
the Democratic Republic of Congo
but considerable further progress,
particularly in developing relevant and
credible capabilities and eradicating
the shortfalls, will be required from
nations if the full aspirations set out in
the Headline Goal are to be met. We are
also encouraging nations to look ahead
to the planning of a Future Headline
Goal. The UK has promoted a European
defence capabilities agency in the draft
EU Treaty, to energise the development
of capabilities and coordinate
associated acquisition policies.

# Chapter 3

#### Future Requirements for Defence


**Implications for Defence**

3.1 There are currently no major

conventional military threats to the UK or
NATO – but the threat from proliferation
and international terrorism remains very
real and in the worst case could result
in serious casualties and significant
disruption to the national economy and
our way of life. The key implications for
defence planning that we can draw from
our analysis of the security challenge are:

- The UK will remain actively engaged

in potential areas of instability in
and around Europe, the Near East,
North Africa and the Gulf. But we
must extend our ability to project
force further afield than the SDR
envisaged. In particular, the potential
for instability and crises occurring
across sub-Saharan Africa and
South Asia, and the wider threat from
international terrorism, will require us
both to engage proactively in conflict
prevention and be ready to contribute
to short notice peace support and
counter-terrorist operations.



- The UK will not be able to make a

military contribution to the response
to every international crisis. Generally,
where we are involved, we will respond
in coalitions with other countries.
Therefore we must maintain our
existing alliances and develop new
partnerships, seek and exploit political
and military influence, and ensure
access for our forces in times of crisis.

- Our forces must be equipped and

configured to fulfil the requirement
identified in the New Chapter to
protect our citizens at home and
counter international terrorism across
the globe.

- We must be more prepared for

‘asymmetric’ attacks (those avoiding
direct conventional conflict with
our military forces) by both state
and non-state actors, including
the employment of WMD delivered
through a variety of means.

**Future Need For Forces**

3.2 Defending the UK, protecting

our interests overseas, dealing with the
proliferation of WMD and addressing the
threat from international terrorism require
a clear focus on projecting force, further
afield and even more quickly than has
previously been the case. This places
a premium on the deployability and
sustainability of our forces, sometimes
in circumstances where access, basing
and overflight cannot be guaranteed.
The added demands placed on our
Armed Forces by the expanding range
of tasks and greater geographical scope
of deployment will require our forces
and their supporting structures to be


more flexible and adaptable. Multiple
concurrent Small to Medium Scale[3]
operations will be the most significant
factor in our force planning. Counterterrorism and counter proliferation
operations in particular will require rapidly
deployable forces able to respond swiftly
to intelligence and achieve precise effects
in a range of environments across the
world. Regional tensions and potential
conflicts are likely to sustain high demand
for enduring peace support commitments
such as the extended deployments
that we have seen in the Balkans and
Afghanistan. But our forces must retain
the capacity to undertake Large Scale
operations at longer notice in Europe, the
Mediterranean and the Gulf Region.

3.3 We must therefore plan to support

the three concurrent operations, of
which one is an enduring peace support
operation, that have become the norm in
recent years. This requires the rebalancing
of the Armed Forces to enable them better
to meet the demands of the more likely
Small and Medium Scale contingencies
and needs to include the enhancement
of strategic enablers – communications,
logistics and intelligence. We will maintain
a broad spectrum of maritime, land, air,
logistics, C4ISR[4] and Special Forces
capability elements to ensure we are able
to conduct limited national operations,
or be the lead or framework nation for
coalition operations, at Small to Medium
Scale. But we will not need to generate
large-scale capabilities across the
same spectrum, given that in the most
demanding operations we will be operating
alongside the US and other allies, where
capabilities such as air defence and naval
escorts are less likely to be at a premium.


_3 An example of a Small Scale operation is the UK’s deployment to Macedonia in 2001; Afghanistan (2001) was at Medium Scale;_
_and Operation TELIC, Large Scale. For further information on scales of effort, and the Military Tasks, see Supporting Essay 2._

provide those capabilities that deliver
the greatest impact when operating
alongside the US. Continuing exchanges
with the US on issues such as rapid
deployment planning, developing
doctrine and concepts, and new
technologies, will remain important. The
key to retaining interoperability with the
US, for our European allies as well as
the UK, is likely to rest in the successful
operation of NATO’s new Allied
Command for Transformation.


through the Police, the other emergency
services, HM Customs and Excise, port
authorities and local authorities. Some of
our military forces are routinely employed
to meet specific military responsibilities –
such as Air Defence – others support the
civil authorities, when requested to do so,
in preventing or managing the aftermath
of a crisis at home. The military tasks to
which the Ministry of Defence allocates
specific forces are:

- Air operations to protect UK airspace

through radar surveillance and
Quick Reaction Alert fighter aircraft
– numbers of the latter were doubled
after the New Chapter, and will be
kept at levels commensurate with the
threat;

- Maritime and air operations to deal

with threats from renegade shipping
– additional investment has been
provided since the New Chapter to
reduce response times of helicopterborne response forces;

- Explosive ordnance disposal, including

of potential WMD;

- Specialised counter-terrorist

operations, including hostage release;

- Operations in Northern Ireland.  The

Armed Forces will continue to support
the Police Service for Northern
Ireland’s (PSNI) public order and
counter-terrorist operations for as
long as they are needed. We will
reduce the level of forces committed
to this task as soon as the improving
security situation and the capability
and confidence of the PSNI allows.
Ultimately, our aim is to achieve
a situation where an element of
our deployable force structure is
permanently based in Northern Ireland,
just as throughout the rest of the UK.

3.9 The New Chapter committed us

to improvements in liaising with the civil
authorities and emergency services
and gave a new role to the Volunteer
Reserves – the Civil Contingencies
Reaction Force (CCRF). The 14 CCRFs
are a way of organising the Volunteer
Reserves to exploit their individual and
collective strengths based on existing
Territorial Army infantry battalions. We
have established new posts to administer
the CCRF role and their training
programmes – an additional two training
days for all Volunteer Reserves for
tasks assisting the civil authority and an
additional five for all CCRF volunteers.


3.4  To meet the challenges of the
future, in particular the threats posed
by international terrorism and the
proliferation of WMD, and maintain
a qualitative edge over potential
adversaries, we will need to continue to
modernise our forces to concentrate on
the characteristics of speed, precision,
agility, deployability, reach and
sustainability. Key to this process will
be our ability to derive the full benefit
of advancing technology, particularly in
the collection, management and use of
information through NEC and increasing
the deployability, sustainability and
protection of our forces.  We will
continue to develop effects-based
operations and planning, maximising the
combined contributions of our available
capabilities to achieving decisive military
effect (effects are dealt with in more
detail in Chapter 4 and Supporting
Essay 2). The Ministry of Defence
will work with other government
departments, particularly the Foreign
and Commonwealth Office (FCO)
and the Department for International
Development (DFID) to ensure that
military effects-based planning
complements wider strategic planning
and the cross-government effort on
crisis prevention and management.

3.5 The most demanding expeditionary

operations, involving intervention against
state adversaries, can only plausibly be
conducted if US forces are engaged,
either leading a coalition or in NATO.
Where the UK chooses to be engaged,
we will wish to be able to influence
political and military decision making
throughout the crisis, including during
the post-conflict period. The significant
military contribution the UK is able to
make to such operations means that we
secure an effective place in the political
and military decision-making processes.
To exploit this effectively, our Armed
Forces will need to be interoperable with
US command and control structures,
match the US operational tempo and


3.6 We must ensure that we continue
to play a leading part in the development
of NATO and EU (through ESDP)
capabilities better configured to conduct
expeditionary operations outside Europe.
Our Armed Forces will continue to be
prepared and equipped to lead and
act as the framework nation for ESDP
or similar ad hoc coalitions’ operations
where the US is not participating.

3.7 As well as contingent operations

overseas, routine deployments, combined
with our participation in international
exercises, do much to promote stability
and enhance international engagement.
We will also continue to conduct a broad
range of non-operational international
activities designed to stabilise and
strengthen the global security climate
by preventing conflict and countering
international terrorism. As part of the
wider government effort, Defence
Relations activities will address the
causes of conflict by building regional
confidence, reducing tensions and
deepening understanding and trust on all
sides, through a variety of arms control,
counter proliferation, security sector
reform and defence education initiatives.
Defence Relations efforts will help to
combat the symptoms of conflict by
enhancing regional conflict prevention,
peacekeeping and counter-terrorist
capacities through the provision of training
and equipment. And when there is the
need for the UK to operate overseas to
counter threats or contain crises, we will
call upon our defence relationships to help
secure operational access, interoperability
and local political and military support.
(The comprehensive strategy that has
been devised to better focus and prioritise
our Defence Relations activities and
resources is described in Supporting
Essay 4.)

**Home Capability**

3.8 The safety and security of the

population of the UK is the responsibility
of the Home Office and similar bodies
and devolved Administrations, delivered


-----

**CCRF**

The concept was first set out in a
discussion paper in June 2002, with
final decisions announced in October
2002. It was welcomed by the
emergency services, local authorities,
the public and the Volunteer Reserves
themselves. The CCRFs will provide
a pool of approximately 500 trained
volunteers drawn from all three Services
in each region to provide, on request,
assistance to the local authorities
and emergency services whether the
problem arose from terrorist attack,
accident, or natural disaster.

An Initial Operating Capability was
declared on 31 December 2002 with
the plan to achieve Full Operating
Capability by 31 December 2003.
The process of recruiting and training
to achieve this goal is well underway.
At the end of September, some 5,230
Volunteer Reserves had signed up
for the CCRFs. This represents
75% of planned strength, although
the geographical distribution is at
present still uneven.

CCRF training has focused on the
likely roles that individuals and units
are likely to undertake in assisting the
emergency services, such as access
control. Volunteers receive training to
familiarise them with their mobilisation
process as well as the organisation and
procedures used by the emergency
services. The command and control of
CCRFs has been explored through the
participation of Regional Headquarters
in contingency planning exercises
with the civil authorities. Within each
region, a series of practical exercises
that include call-out, mobilisation
and deployment is now taking
place to demonstrate that CCRFs
have achieved their Full Operating
Capability.


3.10 In liaising with the civil authorities,
we learned from the foot and mouth
crisis – reinforced by the New Chapter
process – that we needed to provide
a single point of contact for local and
regional authorities and agencies, with
the capacity to support round-the-clock
operations in the UK when necessary.
We announced in the New Chapter that
this was to be achieved through Joint
Regional Liaison Officers (JRLO) with
additional Volunteer Reserve personnel
available to augment headquarters
as needed. This allows the MOD to
participate fully in contingency planning
by local authorities and government
regional offices. Advance planning
makes responses quicker, more reliable
and more effective. Most of these 300
people have been appointed.

**The Strategic Deterrent & Missile**
**Defence**

3.11 The Government’s policy on
nuclear weapons remains as set out in
the SDR. We are committed to working
towards a safer world in which there
is no requirement for nuclear weapons
and continue to play a full role in
international efforts to strengthen arms
control and prevent the proliferation
of chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons. However, the continuing
risk from the proliferation of nuclear
weapons, and the certainty that a
number of other countries will retain
substantial nuclear arsenals, mean
that our minimum nuclear deterrent
capability, currently represented by
Trident, is likely to remain a necessary
element of our security. The SDR noted
the need to ensure that Trident could
remain an effective deterrent for up to
30 years, and the New Chapter noted
the continuing role of nuclear weapons
as the ultimate guarantor of the UK’s
national security. Decisions on whether
to replace Trident are not needed this
Parliament but are likely to be required in
the next one. We will therefore continue
to take appropriate steps to ensure that
the range of options for maintaining a
nuclear deterrent capability is kept open
until that decision point.


3.12 Missile defence technology is
a growing area of interest following
the ending of the Anti Ballistic Missile
Treaty. Although the technologies are
developing rapidly, missile interceptors
and other means of destroying missiles
will only be able to deal with a limited
ballistic missile threat. They are not a
substitute for nuclear or other forms of
deterrence. However, the addition of
active missile defences may complicate
the thinking of an adversary. We
have agreed with the US to allow the
Fylingdales radar to be used for this
role, but will continue to examine, with
our NATO Allies, the complex web of
strategic issues to inform future political
and policy decisions. Active missile
defences could provide an option for
meeting the threat from WMD and
its means of delivery. But we will
need to consider the right balance
of investment between it, forces for
nuclear deterrence, and other deterrent,
defensive and preventive strategies.

3.13 The UK continues to monitor
developments in the potential ballistic
missile threat to deployed forces.
In parallel, studies looking across
the four pillars of Theatre Ballistic
Missile Defence (TBMD) – Deterrence,
Counterforce, Active Defence and
Passive Defence – have scoped the
extent of the capability gap in this area
and identified potential solutions. The
UK also retains a strong interest in
international fora considering how the
capability may be met by an alliance. Of
particular interest has been the NATO
feasibility study that has examined an
Active Layered Ballistic Missile Defence
capability. The report from this study
is in production, and we will assess its
implications once it is available.

**Implications for Military Tasks**

3.14 Based on this analysis and our
experience from recent operations, we
conclude that the UK’s future military
capability must be configured to meet a
diverse range of contingent operations.
These are reflected in a rationalised
and updated set of 18 Military Tasks
(which are dealt with fully in Supporting
Essay 2 and include the Standing Home
and Overseas Tasks) that provide the
baseline against which we develop
our force structures and capability
requirements for the future. At home,
UK forces must also be prepared to
support the UK civil authorities in
deterring, countering and responding to
the aftermath of a terrorist attack.

# Chapter 4

#### Armed Forces Capabilities


4.1 Over the past five years our

Armed Forces have consistently
and successfully met the extensive
operational demands placed on them,
clearly demonstrating that the capabilities
and force structure put in place by the
SDR put the Armed Forces on the right
path. If, however, we are to meet future
security challenges and exploit to the
full the opportunities provided by new
technologies, continuing, sometimes
radical, changes will be required.

**Delivering Strategic Effect**

4.2 The level of concurrent and

sequential crises, and the sheer range
of military tasks that the UK is likely to
have to meet, place extensive and varied
demands on our Armed Forces. Even
within individual operations they will often
be faced with several tasks at once.
This was recently the case in Iraq where
our forces simultaneously conducted
high intensity combat, stabilisation, and
humanitarian assistance operations.
Such complexity demands highly
adaptive forces that must be able
routinely and rapidly to meet the most
likely (and frequently occurring) smalland medium-sized operations, whilst also
being able to generate appropriate forces
for the less frequent, but larger, more
demanding and deliberate commitments.


4.3 The SDR New Chapter helped

to create a conceptual framework for
an effects-based approach to force
planning. Further study has confirmed
that this approach can be applied
beyond a response to international
terrorism, across the breadth of military
capability. Since the end of the Cold
War our force planning has been
increasingly more capability-based
than threat-driven – reflected in the
steadily increased flexibility of our
forces. We now focus on operational
outcomes in the form of eight strategic
military effects – Prevent, Stabilise,
Contain, Deter, Coerce, Disrupt, Defeat,
and Destroy – which we want to be
able to deliver (these are set out in
full in Supporting Essay 2) and the
joint capabilities required to achieve
them. While the concept is still at
a relatively early stage, we are now
describing our Military Tasks in more
generic terms using the language
of effects. This supports a future
force development process focussed
on capability - able to contribute to
delivering a range of effects - rather
than like-for-like platform replacements.
As technology and concepts develop,
the joint capabilities needed to deliver
these effects will change. This force
development approach will ensure that
our force structures offer the greatest
utility across all contingent military
tasks, as well as meeting our routine
standing commitments. Conventional
calculations of military power in terms
of numbers of escort vessels, tanks and
fighter aircraft are not yet irrelevant, but
they are certainly much less useful.


4.4 Effects-Based Operations is

a new phrase, but it describes an
approach to the use of force that is
well established – that military force
exists to serve political or strategic
ends. We need a new way of thinking
about this that is more relevant to
today’s strategic environment. Strategic
effects are designed to deliver the
military contribution to a wider crossgovernmental strategy and are focused
on desired outcomes. Our conventional
military superiority now allows us more
choice in how we deliver the effect we
wish to achieve. We have begun to
develop our military capabilities so that
we can provide as wide as possible
a range of options to fulfil operational
objectives without necessarily resorting
to traditional attritional warfare. Some
effects can also be delivered entirely
outside the context of active operations,
for example through Defence Diplomacy
activities as part of long-term conflict
prevention.

4.5 In order to deliver a wide range of

effects, we need to be able to deploy
and configure forces rapidly and have
the capability for rapid decision making,
accompanied by the precise delivery
of force. These characteristics need to
be underpinned by an improved ability
to exploit information that can then be
translated into synchronised responses
to achieve decisive military effect. The
ability to detect the emergence of
threats, to understand their nature, and
our adversaries’ motivations, intentions
and capabilities allows us to target their
weaknesses and better identify our own
vulnerabilities.


-----

4.6 Our opponents may now

increasingly resort to unconventional
means as a way of circumventing the
conventional military superiority of
Western forces. Achieving a significant
information advantage over our
opponents will better prepare us to
face such asymmetric threats and plan
appropriate responses. And EffectsBased Operations demand that we
exploit to the full our own capabilities to
act asymmetrically.

4.7 NEC is crucial to the rapid delivery

of military effect. The SDR New Chapter
recognised NEC as being fundamental
in countering terrorism abroad, with its
ability to deliver precise and decisive
military effects, with unparalleled
speed and accuracy through linking
sensors, decision-makers and weapons
systems. Clearly, its applicability and
utility is much broader than that and
will involve the effective integration of
military capability. When implemented,
it will allow us to prosecute the full
range of contingent operations with
greater awareness, confidence and
control. It relies on the ability to collect,
fuse and analyse relevant information
in near real-time so as to allow rapid
decision making and the rapid delivery
of the most appropriate military force to
achieve the desired effect. In addition
therefore to the provision of a digitised
communications network itself, we
must also ensure that the appropriate
sensors are available to gather
information and that our forces have
the appropriate reach and deployability
to achieve rapid effect. The ability
to respond quickly and decisively to
achieve maximum effect should also
act as a force multiplier, allowing the
same military effect to be achieved with
less. NEC will improve communication
and understanding of strategic and
military intent throughout the chain of
command. Through NEC the command
structure will improve its responsiveness
to events on the ground and have the
flexibility to respond in near real-time
to fleeting targets, even where higherlevel decision making is required prior to
engagement.


**Capability Implications**

4.8 It is highly likely that the Armed

Forces will, in future, be more frequently
employed on peace support and
counter-terrorist operations where the
focus will be on conflict prevention and
stabilisation, rather than the defeat of
opposing forces.  But high intensity
combat can occur across most of the
spectrum of operations, and it is our
success in such situations that will
remain the benchmark against which to
judge operational capability.

4.9 Striking the right balance of

capabilities to meet all eight strategic
effects will not be easy. We will not
be able to hold on to platforms or
force elements that do not have the
flexibility to meet the demands of future
operations. In particular, it is now clear
that we no longer need to retain a
capability against the re-emergence of
a direct conventional strategic threat to
the United Kingdom or our allies. Priority
must be given to meeting a wider range
of expeditionary tasks, at greater range
from the United Kingdom and with
ever-increasing strategic, operational
and tactical tempo. Demand in these
circumstances falls most heavily on
key enablers, such as logistics, and
scarce high value assets. The new
capability we plan to introduce will only
be effective when employed by highly
trained, professional forces. Alongside
the investment in equipment and
systems, we will also invest in training
the people that operate them to develop
the skills they will need to realise the
potential benefits of the new technology.


-----

##### g y g g
 Defence White Paper


**People**

Our ability to deliver an effective
expeditionary capability will depend
on our ability to sustain sufficient,
trained and motivated Armed
Forces personnel. Developing and
sustaining our ‘personnel capability’
– in parallel with our equipment and
logistic capabilities – is essential
to operational success. Ultimately,
the delivery of effective operational
capability relies on our ability to
deploy sufficient numbers of Armed
Forces personnel with the right skills
and training, supported by civilian
personnel.  We are developing a
new Service Personnel Plan to better
manage delivery in this critical area.

Recent efforts to improve recruitment
have delivered results but we are
continuing to look for innovative ways
to discuss the benefits of a Service
career with young people. One
recent initiative is the use of a mobile
recruitment centre in the London area.

On retention, we have an array of
policy initiatives designed to sustain
our people and their families. These
range from policies designed
to impact directly on front-line
operational effectiveness, through
to policies designed to adequately
reward our personnel.  Financial
Retention Incentives have also been
employed to help overcome the
shortages of certain specialisms
within the Armed Forces. Beyond this
there are policies designed to support
our personnel away on operations
such as the Operational Welfare
Package (which we have extended
to provide additional assistance for
families) and policies for the family
which seek to improve both choice
for accommodation and the support
we offer.


The quality of the training and
education we provide is vital for
developing and getting the most
out of our people - it underpins
operational capability, improves
retention and enhances personal
development.  We are one of the
largest training organisations in the
UK, and to maximise the return on
our investment, we conducted a
Defence Training Review in 2001.
Key initiatives include the creation
of a single focus for training and
education policy, the formation of
the Defence Academy in 2002, and
a Defence-wide e-Learning Delivery
and Management Capability that
will be introduced early in 2004 and
enable greater access to e-learning
facilities when and where required.
The investment in our people has a
wider payoff. Every year thousands
of service personnel leave the Forces
and take up jobs in the outside
world, their skills, experience and
accredited qualifications gained
during service benefiting UK plc
through their contribution to the
economy and to society.

We must also improve our ability to
identify potential problems and to
deliver the right solutions. The Joint
Personnel Administration system
will be essential in achieving this,
revolutionising pay and personnel
administration. In time it will provide
a single source of authoritative and
increasingly real time data for the
personnel of all three Services, which
we can use to develop future policy.

The Supporting Essay on People
(Essay 5) contains further details of
the particular challenges we face
and the specific policies we have
developed in response.


**Maritime**

4.10 Our emphasis in the maritime
environment is increasingly on
delivering effect from the sea onto
the land, which includes a land attack
capability, supporting forces ashore
and on securing access to the theatre
of operations and protecting the crucial
sea lines of communications from the
home base. The new amphibious
ships coming into service over the next
two years, together with the existing
small aircraft carriers and Tomahawk
land attack missiles, offer a versatile
capability for projecting land and air
power ashore. We are developing the
increased use of secure joint sea-based
logistics, particularly for operations
where Host Nation Support is limited or
where, for force protection or political
reasons, we would wish to reduce our
ashore footprint.  The introduction of
the two new aircraft carriers with the
Joint Combat Aircraft early in the next
decade will offer a step increase in our
ability to project air power from the sea.
The Type 45 destroyer will enhance
protection of joint and maritime forces
and assist force projection. Some of our
older vessels contribute less well to the
pattern of operations that we envisage,
and reductions in their numbers will be
necessary.

**Land**

4.11 Future land forces will be equipped
and trained to deliver a decisive impact
across the full spectrum of operations.
An appropriate force package will
be selected for each operation,
drawing from a flexible and balanced
land force structure. UK land forces
currently consist of a mix of heavy
and light capabilities. The former offer
firepower, integral tactical mobility
and protection necessary to carry out
ground manoeuvre warfare but require
a considerable effort to deploy and
support on operations. Light forces in
contrast can deploy rapidly anywhere
in the world but lack much of the
firepower, mobility and protection to
conduct decisive operations against
an enemy equipped with armour and
mechanised forces. To increase our
flexibility in responding to crises, a
new set of medium weight forces will
be developed, offering a high level of
deployability (including by air), together
with much greater levels of mobility and
protection than are currently available to
light forces.


-----

4.12 Medium weight forces will not,
however, remove the requirement
for heavier armoured forces, the
attributes and advantages of which
were demonstrated in the conflict in
Iraq. Heavy forces will continue to be
held for operations where the greater
protection and combat power offered
by Challenger 2, Warrior and AS 90 is
required. Moving to a more graduated
and balanced structure of light, medium
and heavy forces will over time lead to
a reduced requirement for main battle
tanks, other heavy armoured fighting
vehicles and heavy artillery, offset by
a new requirement for medium-weight
forces based on the Future Rapid
Effects System family of vehicles. We
judge that we can reduce the size of
our armoured forces now. We intend to
create a new light brigade and reduce
the number of armoured brigades from
three to two. This new brigade will
both enhance our existing intervention
capability and enable the Army to meet
more easily the roulement demands
posed by enduring peace support tasks
through the availability of an additional
pool of combat forces as well as key
logistics and other specialist enablers.
Plans for future Army forces structures
are still evolving – further details will be
announced in 2004.

4.13 The forthcoming introduction of
the Apache attack helicopter represents
a step change in capability compared
to current in-service helicopters. Attack
helicopters will be in high demand to
support the full range of contingent
tasks, not just Large Scale operations.
We are therefore reviewing how best
to integrate the capability into an Army
force structure optimised for Medium
and Small Scale operations.


**Air**

4.14 We want to be able to project air
power from both the land and the sea,
offering capabilities across the range of
air operations, but with a clear emphasis
on offensive effect.  Storm Shadow
missiles will provide an air launched long
range stand-off precision strike capability,
while the increasing availability of ‘smart’
bombs such as Paveway IV ensure high
degrees of accuracy in our offensive
operations. Additionally, Typhoon and
the addition of the Joint Combat Aircraft,
will offer much greater flexibility and
balance in the air component of the
future, reducing the need for singlerole fast jets. Multi-role capability will
also allow deployed force packages to
be smaller where coverage of multiple
roles have previously required additional
aircraft. We are now considering how
and when we should reduce the numbers
of combat aircraft in order to reflect these
developments

**Strategic Enablers and Logistics**

4.15 The increased frequency and
duration of operations has emphasised
the need to plan carefully and utilise
our logistic enablers to best effect. This
has led us to consider logistics as a
component of capability in its own right.
Recent deployments have reinforced the
importance of visibility of assets, and
better understanding of the relationship
between lead times and stockpiles, in
order to improve the synergy between
our stock-holding requirement and
‘smart’ contracts with industry (either
to stockpile for us, or to manufacture
quickly as and when required). This in
turn will enable us to reduce logistic risks
in our planning for future operations.

4.16 We will also strive to minimise
logistic demand by improving the
inherent reliability and ease of
maintenance of equipment, and
the effectiveness and efficiency of


engineering and asset management
processes. This will be optimised
within the logistic elements of the NEC
framework.

4.17 The requirement to plan to support
three concurrent operations, one of
which is an enduring peace support
operation, requires rebalancing and
further investment in a range of strategic
enablers and logistics. We will seek to
reorganise logistic enablers to maximise
their utility on expeditionary operations,
seeking to project a smaller, lighter and
more rapidly deployable initial presence,
while alleviating the demands placed on
specialist personnel.

4.18 Such rapid deployment of land
and air combat power is dependent on
having sufficient sea and air transport
with the capacity to lift over-size loads.
The core of this capability will continue to
centre on the C-130 fleet, and the A400M
when the latter replaces older C-130s
from 2011.  We have already announced
that we are considering the options for
retaining a small force of C-17s after
A400M enters service, in order to carry
the largest air deployable items.  We now
also have our fleet of six Roll-on/Roll-off
vessels that proved their worth in moving
our forces to the Gulf. They are crucial
to achieving a rapid build up for Medium
Scale operations. Entering service next
year will be the first of four new Landing
Ships Dock (Auxiliary) which will replace
the older Landing Ships Logistic – each
new ship will be capable of deploying
twice the quantity of vehicles and stores
of their predecessors. We also have
plans to procure new ships under the
Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability
programme, which, when in service, will
deliver afloat support to deployed forces.
For larger, more deliberate operations,
we will continue to need to charter both
air and sea lift to augment this core
capability.

4.19 Increased protection for our Armed
Forces on operations is an area of
continued importance and an important
strategic enabler. In particular, we will
continue to work hard at improving
combat identification so as further to
reduce the potential for ‘friendly-fire’
incidents. In the face of continuing
proliferation of WMD, we must maintain
the capability of the Armed Forces to
operate when faced with the threat or
use of Chemical, Biological, Radiological
and Nuclear (CBRN) weapons, by
developing enhanced detection
systems, physical protection, vaccines
and other medical countermeasures.

##### g y g g
 Defence White Paper


**C4ISR**

4.20 Command, Control,
Communications, Computers,
Intelligence, Surveillance and
Reconnaissance (C4ISR) is the term we
use to describe the enabling activities
that provide knowledge at all levels
of operations so that our response
to contingencies can be planned,
organised and executed effectively.
This includes an understanding of the
threat, the environment (political, social
and physical) and our own capabilities.
Effective C4ISR has the ability to gather,
analyse and distribute such information
to manage efficiently all aspects of
operations and lies at the heart of NEC.
Our aim is to be sufficiently proficient
at C4ISR to operate at a tempo that
will outpace and dominate potential
adversaries, including when we face
an asymmetric threat. We also need
to be able to operate alongside our
most technically advanced allies and in
coalitions of the willing.

4.21 We are investing heavily in
digitised communications systems
to provide the heart of the ‘network’.
Both BOWMAN, at the tactical level,
and FALCON, at the operational
level, represent major enhancements
to our C4ISR capability.  Specialist
communications personnel represent
a particular manpower ‘pinch point’
and we are reorganising and enhancing
this area so as to provide a more
robust deployable capability able to
support a larger number of deployed
headquarters.

4.22 The MOD has already placed
considerable investment in developing
stand-off sensors, such as Unmanned
Air Vehicles (eg WATCHKEEPER) and
improved electronic warfare capabilities
(eg SOOTHSAYER).  The ASTOR
airborne battlefield surveillance system
will meet the Army and RAF requirement
for surveillance, reconnaissance and
target acquisition information. It will
also provide the UK’s contribution
to the Alliance Ground Surveillance
project. Exploiting these systems to
the full also requires us to enhance
the fusion, analysis and accessibility
of data collected so as to improve
responsiveness and provide better
support to deployed commanders.
Improved stand-off sensors do not,
however, remove the requirement for
timely and accurate human intelligence
(HUMINT), particularly in the field at the
operational and tactical levels.


-----

**Joint Rapid Reaction Force and**
**Readiness**

4.23 Operational experience since 1998
has confirmed the central importance
of the SDR concept of graduated
readiness. The Joint Rapid Reaction
Force (JRRF) will continue to provide
the pool of high readiness forces for
rapid commitment to operations, at
up to Medium Scale. We are currently
assessing what changes need to be
made to the forces assigned to the
JRRF to reflect the increased frequency
of Small and Medium Scale operations.
We are also looking carefully, in light of
lessons identified from operations in
Iraq, at how we can improve the ability
of our forces to prepare in advance of
a commitment to specific operational
deployments. One key step already
identified is to seek to organise our
land forces in particular with robust,
deployable establishments so as to
minimise the requirement for units
and formations to be reinforced with
additional personnel on deployment.

**Harmony**

4.24 The recent level of commitments
faced by all three Services has imposed
demands on some of our people and
assets that are not sustainable on a
routine basis. This at least in part is
because a number of critical ‘pinch
point’ enabling capabilities, including
certain logistic support, medical,
engineer and other specialists, are
not appropriately structured to meet
the demands of multiple concurrent
operations. A key element of our force
rebalancing will, therefore, be to ensure
that resources are reallocated to those
capabilities currently over-employed
on operations. In the Army we will
rebalance key support elements towards
the brigade from the divisional level.
Other more specialist single service and
joint capabilities will continue to be held
at a higher level, but with sufficiently
robust establishments to meet the
harmony guidelines established to avoid
excessive burdens being placed on
individuals.


**Reserves**

4.25 Our Reserve Forces have evolved
since SDR to become an integral part
of the UK’s military capability for all
types of operation. They have played
a key role in recent operations (to
date, over 7,500 Reservists have been
mobilised for operations in Iraq) and the
demand for their support seems likely
to continue. We will continue to use
the Reserves, not only for Large Scale
operations but also to reinforce some
specialist capabilities such as medical
and logistic support to smaller scale
deployments. This will require evercloser integration between the regular
and reserve elements of the Services
and a commitment to improve the
relationship between the Services, the
Reservists themselves, their families and
their employers. Our Reserves policy is
explored in greater detail in Supporting
Essay 3.

**Concepts and Doctrine**

4.26 Concepts and Doctrine are the
processes through which we develop
our requirements for future military
capability to meet our required effects
and establish how we will subsequently
apply military capability to achieve
those effects. The Joint Doctrine and
Concepts Centre (JDCC), established
as a result of the SDR, working with
the single Services and the Permanent
Joint Headquarters, continues to have
an important role in explaining and
developing operational concepts in
response to an uncertain and complex
security environment and in developing
doctrine on peace support operations.
The JDCC is also finalising a new, high
level operational concept that integrates
the flow of operational information
in order to generate fast and robust
decision making and enable the Armed
Forces to operate at a much higher
tempo than a potential adversary,
thereby improving our ability to respond
to modern crises.


**Collective Training**

4.27 Robust and effective collective
military training is critical to the
generation of capable forces and the
need for more rapid response times will
require both joint and combined (i.e.
with allies) training to be undertaken
on a regular basis before specific
operations have been identified.  It will
continue to be underpinned by a number
of fundamentals, including singleService ethos and fighting spirit, and
effective lower-tier training activity in
the maritime, land and air environments.
However, the focus will be on joint,
combined and fully integrated training
for operations that cross all components
of capability. To meet these demands
we must continue to exercise at the
operational level, as was so effectively
demonstrated in 2001 on Exercise SAIF
SAREEA.  Additionally, our more routine
tactical exercises will build in a greater
degree of joint training to ensure that we
can meet the full range of short notice
Small and Medium Scale commitments.
In the future this will include novel ways
of using a network of live and virtual
training environments.

# Chapter 5

#### Supporting Capability


5.1 Our success will be judged by

the operational performance of our
Armed Forces and the Department’s
aim is therefore to maximise military
capability as effectively as we can. This
requirement impacts on all areas of the
Department, from combat units through
to supporting organisations and the
processes we use. Our continuing focus
is to ensure we have the structures and
process to develop, deploy, sustain and
operate the military capability required
to conduct expeditionary operations and
to achieve the range of strategic effects.
This focus, encapsulated in the Defence
Vision (set out at Annex), combined with
our desire to adopt the most efficient
and effective way of conducting our
business, brings significant operational
benefit and value for money for the
taxpayer.


**Defence Management**

5.2 To generate and sustain military

forces, we have to combine the
components – such as people, training,
equipment, logistics support – which
together produce military capability. This
task of ‘joining up’ is the key one facing all
managers in defence. In order to achieve
it, we apply a number of tools across the
business of defence. These include:

- Clear objective setting through, for

example, the introduction of Service
Delivery Agreements;

- Identifying cost drivers by thorough

analysis of business processes;

- Risk planning through the

establishment of risk registers and by
fostering a culture that manages risk
rather than being risk averse;

- Performance improvement through

the Defence Change Programme;

- Performance management through

the Defence Balanced Scorecard.

5.3 Effective management needs to be

applied across the business of Defence
in order to achieve enhanced military
capability. Smart Acquisition engages
this, from customer to end user, by
aiming to acquire and sustain assets
and services more effectively at lower
risk and with reduced through life costs.
The effectiveness and efficiency of
logistics processes is being addressed
by the Defence Logistics Organisation
(DLO) which combines the singleService elements. The End to End
Review of Logistic Processes in the air
and land environments (see Supporting
Essay 6), which recently reported its
findings, examined logistic support
processes throughout Defence to find
ways of improving their effectiveness
and efficiency.


5.4 The need for effective
management applies equally in the
areas of infrastructure and people.
Across the Defence Estate, the
Core Site Rationalisation Initiative
is starting to provide more coherent
estate management. Rationalisation
programmes are also underway
across defence training and education
based on the findings of the Defence
Training Review, and in the provision
of medical support (the Defence
Health Programme). Supporting Essay
6 covers our approach to Defence
Management in greater depth.


**Lyons Review**

The Lyons Review is a crossgovernment initiative to look at public
sector relocation from the South
East, where it is concentrated, to the
other regions. In recent years the
Department has already relocated a
significant amount of defence activity
from London and the South East,
notably to the South West. Through
our corporate management of the
Estate around key core sites we aim
to create a Defence Estate of the
right size, shape and location. The
implementation of this Core Sites
Strategy has informed our active
engagement in the Lyons Review, the
principles of which continue to inform
our estate strategy.

**Head Office**

5.5 Working closely with Other

Government Departments to formulate
policy and strategy, and as the directing
military headquarters during crisis
management and operations, the MOD
Head Office needs to be increasingly
responsive and flexible. Internal
reorganisation and the redevelopment
of the MOD Main Building as part of
the Head Office Modern Environment
(HOME) programme will bring about
an important step change in the
ways in which we conduct business
with improved ways of working and
increased connectivity. It will allow
the headquarters activities to be
concentrated in two Whitehall sites,
with one further building in central
London, as part of the overall reduction
in Head Office staff in central London
from over 12,500 in 1990 to less than
5,200 by the time the redevelopment
project completes in 2004. Five London
buildings will be released as a result
(bringing the number of buildings the
MOD occupies down from more than
20 in 1990 to just 3). We will continue
to work with both the Efficiency Review
and the Lyons Review to deliver further
reductions in both the size of the estate
and numbers of personnel. This process
will be enhanced through the Defence
Information Infrastructure programme,
which will replace 300 diverse information
systems worldwide, providing greatly
increased interoperability and the basis
for progress towards the implementation
of e-Government, as well as substantial
savings.


**Equipment and Technology**

5.6 Future military capability is

dependent upon the equipment our
forces operate, and the technology
that underpins this. At the heart of
the equipment programme will be the
development of our NEC. This will
involve both bringing together previously
unconnected capabilities and ensuring
that new systems and platforms are
‘network ready’. Throughout we will
continue to seek the right balance
between quality and quantity in the
equipment we buy. Our equipment must:

- Be inherently deployable and

logistically frugal to reduce the logistic
burden on our deployed forces;

- Provide greater protection, including

combat identification, across our
capabilities and, most importantly,
when working with coalition forces;

- Place the lowest practical demands

on our manpower with improved
ergonomics and more effective,
integral training systems;

- Be able to survive and remain useable

when faced with the threat of CBRN
weapons;

- Be readily adaptable to allow

capabilities to be modified to deal with
new threats or undertake new tasks,
and to capitalise on the opportunities
offered by new technologies.

5.7 The increased use of

experimentation through the prototyping
of live systems and the use of synthetic
environments will ensure that equipment
is network ready, fit for purpose and
used to best effect.

5.8 Continued investment in science

and technology will remain critical if
we are to develop and sustain effective
capabilities in the face of new and
emerging threats. Through its new
output driven strategy, the Defence
Science and Technology Board will
ensure that we get the right investment
balance between sustaining inhouse expertise and developing new
technology in our supplier base.


5.9 We are also strengthening the UK

defence technology base by expanding
our research supplier base and also
by developing new partnerships with
industry and the academic sector.
Following the successful completion
of the sale of a controlling stake in
QinetiQ to the Carlyle Group, we are
progressively introducing competition
in the defence research programme.
By 2007, some 70% of the programme
previously sourced only through QinetiQ
will be placed through competition,
delivering improved value for money and
enabling a far wider supplier network
to bid into the programme. Through
initiatives such as Defence Technology
Centres and Towers of Excellence, we
have developed new relations with our
key industrial suppliers, small- and
medium-sized companies and many
Universities. These will help ensure
we are able to generate the right
technologies in the supplier base at the
right time to meet our future capability
requirements. Our research focus and
partnership strategies are examined
further in Supporting Essay 7.

 Defence White Paper


**People**

5.10 We need personnel policies that
cover all stages of a service person’s
career, from thinking about joining to
leaving the Forces afterwards. The
Services develop their people throughout
their careers in order to meet the range
of tasks required to generate military
capability. A series of new initiatives
is in hand, including a new strategy
for Defence Housing; tri-Service
disciplinary arrangements; new pension
and compensation arrangements;
modernised Joint Personnel
Administration and rationalised delivery
of individual training. The Veterans
Initiative joins central Government and
the voluntary sector in a cross-cutting
programme designed both to celebrate
and make the most of the skills and
achievements of our service men and
women while ensuring that the more
vulnerable are supported.  People results
this year have been positive – with an
increase in the size of the Forces and a
reduction in under-manning. But we will
need to continue to invest in targeted
and effective measures if we are to
sustain this improvement. Looking
more widely, we will continue to explore
every opportunity to work in a more
joint fashion (between the Services and
with the Civilian Personnel structures),
ensuring that the Services, Head Office
and supporting organisations work ever
more closely together, and by driving
forward the key change programmes.

5.11 The modern Civil Service requires
a motivated workforce with the right
skills and flexibility to support Ministers
and the Armed Forces now and into
the future. Our new civilian Human
Resources Strategy addresses the
priority issues of better planning,
performance, development, and
improved people management to deliver
this objective.


**Youth and Community Projects**

Defence makes some important
contributions to the civil community
through its, often low, profile work
in support of schools and young
people, veterans, and life-long
learning:

The MOD sponsored Cadet Forces
attract 130,000 young people from
12 to 22. These bring adventure
and enjoyment to young people with
a view to steering them towards
responsible citizenship. They also
lead many cadets into full-time and
reserve service with the Armed
Forces.

Skillforce is a national youth initiative
that uses recently retired military
instructors to provide Key Skill
activities to 14-16 year olds who are
in danger of becoming disaffected
with the formal academic education
system. 23 teams involve 2,500
young people in almost 100 schools,
with improved attendance rates
(over 90%) and reduced exclusions
(70%).

Outreach is an Army Cadet
Force programme for 12-14 year
olds who are identified as either
Crime Vulnerable or Socially
Disadvantaged.

The Veterans Task Force promotes
the interests of Service Veterans
through a range of crossgovernment initiatives. It aims to
ensure that at least 80% of Service
Leavers find work within six months
of leaving the Armed Forces, and
works in conjunction with the
Homeless Directorate and the
Social Exclusion Unit to assist the
small percentage of veterans facing
difficulty in adjusting to civilian life.

# Chapter 6

#### Conclusion


6.1 Our Armed Forces will remain a

crucial and important element of our
national response to a diverse range of
threats and crises that may impact on
the UK and our global interests. The
breadth of the tasks they will be required
to undertake, from peacekeeping,
humanitarian support and confidence
building operations through to counterterrorist and large-scale combat
operations, demand that our forces
be flexible and responsive, multi-roled
and able to reconfigure to achieve the
desired outcome. In taking forward
effects-based planning and operations,
our focus will move away from simple
calculations of platform numbers to
developing network enabled capabilities
designed to achieve a range of strategic
effects. A new range of equipment
and systems entering service over
the coming years will greatly enhance
capability and ensure that UK forces
remain amongst the finest in the world.


6.2 This broad range of operations

will continue to be undertaken on a
multinational basis in an equally broad
alliance/coalition structure. UK forces
can expect to conduct operations
alongside and integrated with US,
NATO, European, UN or other forces
under various command arrangements,
as well as purely national operations.
While a major focus will be on furthering
interoperability with US forces, we
will need to continue to improve our
capacity to operate with our European
and other allies. Encouraging and
supporting others to develop the skills
necessary to engage in multinational
operations is also an important strand of
our policy.


6.3 To achieve our mission within this

challenging strategic environment will
require flexibility across Defence, from
our people, structures and equipment.
We must adapt to stay ahead of
potential adversaries and be prepared
to make tough decisions to ensure that
our forces and equipment deliver the
required capabilities.  Force structures
will need constantly to evolve as we
seek to exploit new technologies,
techniques and equipment to improve
capability and respond to the changing
strategic environment. Through this
process of continuous improvement and
adaptation, we will ensure our Armed
Forces are ready and equipped to face
successfully the challenges of the future
and contribute to wider international
security.

#### The Defence Vision


**DEFENCE VISION**

**Defending the United Kingdom and its**
**interests.**

**Strengthening international peace and**
**security.**

**A force for good in the world**

We achieve this aim by working together
on our core task to produce battlewinning forces:

- fit for the challenge of today;

- ready for the tasks of tomorrow;

- capable of building for the future;

We have shown we succeed in what we
do. We must continue to adapt to a more
uncertain world. We will be flexible and
creative, harnessing new technologies and
ideas to make best use of our resources.

We will base our future direction on:

**Providing strategy that matches new**
**threats and instabilities**

We face new challenges and
unpredictable new conditions. Our
strategy must evolve to reflect these new
realities.

For the future this means:

- evolving strategy and military doctrine

that is flexible and geared to changing
conditions;

- behaving with speed, flexibility and

creativity as an organisation -–in the
way we work and the way we respond
to external events;

- holding fast, in the face of change, to

our underpinning military traditions and
commitment to public service.


**Maintaining flexible force structures**

As our strategy evolves, we will develop
force structures to maintain battlewinning capabilities that are relevant and
effective against emerging threats.

For the future this means:

- greater focus on capability rather than

delivery platforms;

- developing pace of deployment and

impact;

- increasing precision of effect;

- flexibility and agility in terms of

platforms and equipment;

- the highest standards of

professionalism among men and
women imbued with fighting spirit, well
trained and properly equipped.

**Reaching out into the wider world**

We are major contributors to the
business of government and to society
as a whole. We will increasingly
recognise and manage our contribution

For the future this means:

- working closely with other

Departments, with the private and
voluntary sectors in the UK, and with
our allies abroad, to integrate the
military, diplomatic, economic and
social components of crisis resolution;

- strengthening our links with the

Civil Departments to implement the
government’s domestic agenda
– making our contribution in the
regions, and providing support in civil
emergencies;

- playing a key role as part of wider

society, for example in our contribution


to training and skills and to health;

- helping the rest of government benefit

from making wider use of our skills in
project management and delivery;

- working in closer partnership with

the private sector to deliver value for
money.

**Leading a high-performing**
**organisation**

The many demands on the MOD,
including its role as military headquarters,
require us to be first class in the way
we lead and manage the business of
defence.

For the future this means:

- clear leadership at all levels, focussed

on delivering the vision;

- managers free to get on with tasks

and held to account against clear
objectives;

- demonstrably effective management of

our resources;

- stripping out bureaucracy, with ways

of working that are simple and ‘fit
for purpose’ and using common
standards wherever possible;

- working flexibly, with project and task
based teams.

**Investing in our people**

We are world leaders in many aspects
of how we manage and develop our
people. We will build on this with strong
leadership and focused investment.

For the future this means:

- providing strong unified leadership,

service and civilian personnel working
together;


-----

- benefiting from diversity by recruiting

service and civilian personnel reflecting
society as a whole and with the right
skills for the task;

- balancing rewarding successful

performance with robust management
of poor performance;

- being a learning organisation, sharing

knowledge, committed to developing
our people.

By holding true to these principles we will
move forward together to maintain and
enhance our capability.

We draw on our commitment
to public service and military
traditions, acting as one
organisation to achieve our
shared purpose.
