National security is a fundamental responsibility of government. It provides the context within which development and prosperity can take place. It assures freedom of national decision making and protects the values, the traditions and the way of life that are the essence of the nation.

Security is, however, not simply a matter of maintaining a military capability to protect the nation against possible challenges to its sovereignty and interests. Sound relations with neighbours and being prepared to contribute actively to promoting a stable environment are no less important.

Defending the Nation's Sovereignty: Expanding Roles in Wider Horizons, the new Defence White Paper, reflects a comprehensive and proactive approach to the security of Brunei Darussalam. Its foundation remains the stability of the nation itself and its capacity to manage its own affairs. That is the minimum that our people have a right to expect.

The initiatives put forward in the White Paper will significantly enhance the transparency of, and the nation's control over, our immediate security environment. Awareness of, and the capacity to respond rapidly to, activities in border areas and our more immediate maritime approaches will be strengthened.

Close cooperation with civil agencies will ensure a robust response to transnational security challenges and to natural disasters.

At the same time, the White Paper strongly reinforces Brunei Darussalam's commitment to promoting a stable region. Its active participation in the emerging framework for practical security cooperation, particularly the activities of the ASEAN Defence Ministers Meeting that the nation will chair in 2013, is strongly endorsed. The policy areas within the Ministry responsible for those activities are being further developed. The ability to make more significant contributions to stability and peacekeeping operations was an important shaper of the White Paper's capability enhancements.

Providing for the nation's defence does, however, place a significant demand on resources and a responsibility on Defence to use them wisely. With that in mind, the White Paper carefully prioritises how our defence capabilities should be developed in the future. It emphasises the command and control, surveillance and mobility assets that underpin effective operations. More integrated planning within Defence will ensure planning discipline and resource efficiency.

The Defence White Paper builds upon the foundations established in its predecessor, Defending the Nation's Sovereignty, in 2004 and developed further in the 2007 Defence White Paper Update. The comprehensiveness of the guidance it provides reflects the skills and insights of the officers, both military and civilian, who have contributed to its preparation. It equips us well to ensure the nation's future security.

# السلام عليكرورحمة اللّه وبركاته بستوأَلَّهَالْتَّنَّ الْحَيْمِ

When the Royal Brunei Armed Forces was first established fifty years ago on 31 May 1961, known back then as the Brunei Malay Regiment, His Majesty Yang Maha Mulia Maulana Paduka Seri Begawan Al-Sultan Sir Muda Omar 'Ali Saifuddien Sa'adul Khairi Waddien, stressed that its formation was essential part towards becoming a sovereign nation.

Those heartfelt words remain true today.  Although the security environment has undergone many significant changes, Brunei Darussalam under the guidance of His Majesty continues to enjoy a positive strategic setting and sound relations with its neighbours. Consequently, the value of the Royal Brunei Armed Forces to the security and development of the nation has increased immensely. Indeed, the quite diverse set of security-related tasks and challenges facing the nation at present and in the future has further strengthened their relevance to meet the expectations and the trust of the populace whilst remaining credible to the nation.

The new Defence White Paper provides strong basis and clear guidelines for the planning of future RBAF requirements. Strong emphasis is placed on deliverable capabilities encompassing equipment, personnel and deployment supported by the requisite level of preparedness made in accordance to the prioritisation of tasks. The White Paper provides an integrated framework for operational planning and force preparedness bringing in doctrine development and capability programming.

Considerable weight is equally placed on defence diplomacy and cooperative engagement intended to enhance interoperability internally and with the RBAF's strategic partners.

To achieve the policy objectives contained in the White Paper, maximum focus and energy must be placed in its utilization by all RBAF's unit future strategic, operational and tactical plans, aspirations and goals. My immense gratitude and sincerest thanks goes to the team for their efforts and valuable time towards the promulgation of the new Defence White Paper.

Developing defence policy is a complex task. Planning must not only ensure the security and stability of the nation against more immediate challenges. It must seek to promote a favourable strategic environment. It must guard against the possibility, however remote, that a more serious threat to the nation and its interests may arise at some point in the future.

That challenge today is particularly demanding. The spectrum of potential defence operations is broad. Commitments to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, to stability operations and responding to terrorism and other transnational criminal activities are current priorities. More traditional scenarios involving the direct use of military force cannot be ruled out. For all nations, emerging concerns about cyber warfare and the possible proliferation of weapons of mass destruction add a significant new dimension.

Importantly, the response to many of these challenges extends well beyond Defence's own capabilities.

A whole-of-government response marshalling a wide range of national resources may be required.

Stability operations will not be successful without the aid and reconstruction support necessary to build the lasting conditions for peace. Close cooperation with security partners will frequently be essential to the speed and robustness of a response.

To achieve those objectives, a comprehensive approach to the development and employment of the nation's armed forces is required. Capability planning must seek to provide the flexibility to respond to that diverse range of challenges. Force preparedness must ensure the right people and equipment can be deployed at short notice. Operational effectiveness depends upon having the shared doctrine and the command and control systems to integrate all aspects of the response.

The new Defence White Paper, Defending the Nation's Sovereignty: Expanding Roles in Wider Horizons, provides the essential building blocks. It sets out clear priorities for responding to the more immediate challenges while identifying important areas in which the armed forces will need to be developed in the longer term. The balance that it establishes between current preparedness and future development is important, matching available resources to priority defence needs. The White Paper is also notable in that it is not simply content to provide policy solutions to immediate planning challenges. It gives considerable attention to how Defence's planning processes can be further developed and the types of studies that need to be undertaken to support even more comprehensive and informed decision-making. Linking that depth of analysis with clear policy direction will ensure the most efficient use of national resources and maximise the defence contribution to the nation's security and well-being.

Implementing the Defence White Paper will require a focused and sustained commitment from all areas of the Ministry as well as the Royal Brunei Armed Forces. The extent and precision of its guidance gives confidence, however, that its objectives can be achieved and the nation's security and its contribution to that of the wider region will be significantly strengthened.

# Introduction

"The services and contributions to the nation has to be continuous not only for sustainable peace but also for economic development. Development and stable economy would not be possible without peace."
His Majesty the Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam's Titah (Royal Speech)
in conjunction with the Royal Brunci Armed Forces Golden Jubilee Anniversary Celebration on 31 May 2011 Security and stability lie at the heart of the well being of a nation. They provide the environment to nurture development and prosperity and the essential freedom for people to pursue their lives, beliefs and ambitions with confidence. Yet ensuring that security is not an easy task.

Developing the necessary capabilities demands a significant commitment of national resources. Potential challenges need to be carefully prioritised. Working closely with others can be important in promoting a stable environment and a multiplier of national capacity. The preparation of this Defence White Paper occurs at an opportune time. It is now 50 years since the formation of the Royal Brunei Armed Forces. During that time it has evolved into an operationally effective and professional, albeit compact, fighting force serving the nation in a wide range of roles. While there is much continuity in the strategic environment, contributions to stability and peacekeeping operations have become both a more frequent and a more important national task. Strategic developments in the wider Asia-Pacific region are strengthening the imperative for regional security cooperation.

The White Paper is also the third in a series of major policy documents being produced. The initial White Paper, Defending the Nation's Sovereignty, was developed in 2004 to provide clear and consistent guidance for the development and use of the nation's defence assets.

The subsequent Defence Update in 2007, Shaping the Force Today, refined those judgments further. It reviewed recent changes in the security environment and provided more specific recommendations on how to develop the RBAF's capabilities to best serve the national interest.

Defending the Nation's Sovereignty: Expanding Roles in Wider Horizons  is the next step in enhancing the comprehensiveness and the focus of the nation's security policies.

The comprehensive approach the White Paper has adopted to policy development - integrating its planning, operational, capability, organisational and resource dimensions - is illustrated clearly in diagram 1.

![18_image_1.png](18_image_1.png)

tion with the Royal Brunei Anned Forces Golden Jubilee Anniversary Celebration on 31 May 2011 A comprehensive assessment of the strategic environment and the challenges that may emerge to the nation and its interests is the essential foundation for national security planning. It enables both the review of current priorities and the early identification of longer term trends. While the primary focus will always be on matters directly affecting the nation, broader issues with the potential to impact significantly on regional stability must also be considered.

Defending the Nation's Sovereignty was prepared in the wake of September 11 and the Bali bombings. International terrorism and Al Qaeda's loosely linked regional affiliates were striking at the very heart of Southeast Asia. Transnational criminal activity, including people smuggling, arms and drug trafficking and maritime piracy, was on the rise.

By the 2007 Defence White Paper Update, the devastating impact of the tsunami in Indonesia had added even more weight to the non-traditional security agenda and a strong regional dimension to planning priorities. Separatist claims in several neighbouring countries and concerns about potential state failure were judged to have significant implications for regional stability.

## The Immediate Region

A review of the contemporary environment confirms that those issues remain important.

· Terrorism and its links to the activities of radical regional groups remain a serious concern.

Indiscriminate attacks seeking to inflict mass casualties continue to be the terrorists' preferred method of operation. Intra-regional movements of people, arms and finance facilitate these threats.

· While separatist pressures have eased, the potential for internal dissent and a number of border disputes to create tensions between nations or spill over into the region more generally remain a concern.

· The recent tsunami affecting Japan was again a clear reminder of the unexpectedness and potential impact of natural disasters. Maintaining response capabilities at a high state of readiness will be a continuing requirement for all regional countries. Pandemics can quickly spread across national boundaries, endangering the health and well being of the population.

At the same time, recent developments have given prominence to several specific challenges.

· The growing demand for, and for a time at least increasing price of, oil and natural gas has revived interest in offshore exploration and recovery. With deeper water drilling more possible and economically viable, the settling of boundaries, regulation of activities and exercise of sovereignty have renewed importance.

· The effective regulation of natural resource exploitation, particularly in more remote border areas, remains a major concern. Both logging activities in the hinterland and the poaching of fish stocks offshore continue to test the ability of governments to regulate large scale commercial activity.

Defending The Nation's Sovereignty:

![19_image_0.png](19_image_0.png)

Expanding Roles in Wider Horizons
· Damage to the environment can lead to more serious security concerns. Both the impact of the forest fires in the region and the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico are salutary reminders of the potential impact of such activities not being managed effectively.

· Overall capability enhancements to address traditional and non-traditional security issues in Southeast Asia are focused on the legitimate demands of self defence. The strengthening of regional defence capabilities, particularly in the area of maritime patrol operations, offers the opportunity for more effective regulations of those activities and can reduce the risk of localised tensions if approached in a cooperative manner.

## The Wider Asia-Pacific

Significant strategic changes are also occurring in the wider Asia-Pacific context.

· The growth of the major regional powers suggest that there will be some future rebalancing of their regional roles and influence. While this may occur without significant destabilisation - all nations having an interest in continuing growth and access to resources and markets - incidents testing the strength of the emerging powers cannot be ruled out. A stable relationship amongst the major powers is essential in ensuring the continued economic progress and development for the wider Asia-Pacific region.

· As those nations seek to strengthen the depth of their defence and secure lines of communication, more frequent and extensive deployments of maritime forces are likely to occur, particularly in the South China Sea. Providing effective security for the passage of maritime traffic through the Southeast Asian region, including against the threat of piracy, will be important in ensuring the confidence of the major powers.

· It is not in the region's interests that tensions in North-East Asia spill over into conflict.

While the direct military impact on Southeast Asia might be limited, the consequences for overall regional stability and for future growth could be devastating. An arms race would heighten the possibility of major conflict.

![19_image_1.png](19_image_1.png)

![20_image_0.png](20_image_0.png)

![20_image_1.png](20_image_1.png)

An important consequence of this increasingly complex environment has been the emergence of a more comprehensive and practical agenda for regional security cooperation.

· Information exchanges and shared capacity building remain essential to combating terrorism and transnational crime.

· Plans to cooperate in response to natural disasters and humanitarian crises have become a core element of most nations' defence planning.

· The ASEAN-China Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea continues to provide a valuable framework for the peaceful management of overlapping maritime interests.

· The cooperative deployment of forces such as the International Monitoring Team (IMT) in Mindanao reflects the the greater recognition of the value of working together to overcome sources of instability.

· Objectives for the ASEAN Political-Security Community, to be established by 2015, include strengthening cooperation in conflict prevention and resolution, and post-conflict peace building.

## Global Trends

Beyond the region, the implications of global security trends cannot be ignored especially since Brunei Darussalam's economic future is increasingly linked to the global economy. As terrorism has graphically illustrated, geographic distance is no longer as absolute a determinant of security as once thought.

· Instability in other parts of the world can have important implications for the strength of the global system overall as well as more specific outcomes including refugee flows, drug trafficking and piracy.

· The information revolution has created new vulnerabilities. Threats to information systems can undermine competitive advantage and reveal sensitive national information.

· The growing capacity of both state and non-state actors to conduct information warfare has the potential to damage national economies or disrupt decision making without the cost and time associated with conventional military threats.

· The proliferation of the expertise, precursors and delivery systems for the development of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons is of particular concern. Evidence of terrorist ambitions to acquire such weapons highlights the importance of making sure effective control regimes are in place.

![21_image_0.png](21_image_0.png)

Containing the impact of these broader international trends is beyond the capacity of any nation individually. It requires the maintenance of an effective global rules-based order. The preparedness of nations to support its maintenance and respond to significant breaches of the international system is essential. The United Nations remains the organisation that can provide overall coherence and legitimacy to those efforts.

# Defending The Nation

"I have already seen much innovation and to a defence entity that can contribute to nation building, and even the international peace and security through eacekeering and humanitarian missions abroad His Maiesty the Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam's Titah (Royal Speech)
ction with the Royal Brunei Armed Forces 49th Anniversary Celebration on 31 May 2010 Responding effectively to that comprehensive array of security challenges is a demanding task.

· The foundation of the nation's response must be to strengthen its ability to respond independently to those current security issues and prospective shorter term challenges impacting directly on the security and stability of the nation. Managing the national interest in adjacent maritime areas will be particularly important.

· The non-traditional nature of many of the security challenges introduces substantial overlap with civil law enforcement. Close coordination with other government agencies is essential and, while the armed forces may contribute in important areas, strengthening related civil capabilities in parallel is needed to support a comprehensive and tailored response.

· Beyond the nation, active engagement with other nations is essential. It supports the early identification of prospective challenges and the active management of the risks they present. Cooperative management of regional affairs can more effectively target the sources of instability, respond to transnational challenges, and limit the prospect of adverse external power involvement.

Brunei Darussalam's national security interests are to:
· Maintain its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.

· Enhance the prosperity and economic and social well being of the country.

· Preserve the political, cultural and religious identity of the country.

· Help promote regional and global peace, security, stability and prosperity.

## A Comprehensive Strategy

These priorities and the essentiality, given their breadth and complexity, of delivering the nation's defence and security capabilities in a resource efficient manner are reflected clearly in Brunei Darussalam's Vision 2035. In particular, it stresses:

![23_image_1.png](23_image_1.png)

![24_image_0.png](24_image_0.png)

![24_image_1.png](24_image_1.png)

· Close coordination between diplomacy, defence and intelligence to ensure an integrated approach to national security.

· Strengthening the security forces, including the armed forces, police and intelligence agencies, maximising their professionalism and technological expertise.

· Improving the efficiency and cost effectiveness of defence, including the military infrastructure and procurement.

· Further developing the systems and organisations for responding quickly to threats from natural disasters, infectious diseases, acts of terrorism and other emergencies.

· Safeguarding cultural and social harmony and good citizenship within the nation.

· Considering Brunei Darussalam's wider interest, contributing to the security of international trade linking herself to the region and beyond will be important.

Within that overall national security guidance, a specific set of policy objectives have been introduced to guide defence planning. They bring together the nation's geo-strategic character, the capacity of the armed forces to contribute to promoting and protecting its sovereignty and interests, and the specific issues and priorities emerging from the contemporary environment.

## Defence Policy Objectives

Within that overall context, Brunei Darussalam's defence policy objectives are to:
· Maintain a robust and flexible defence capability able to deter aggression and respond to the complex range of security challenges currently of national concern.

· Monitor the strategic environment to ensure the early identification of both specific events and longer term trends that may impact upon the nation's security.

· Protect national interests in adjacent maritime areas, the protection of marine and seabed resources, and fulfilling obligations to provide security for international movement.

· Support civil enforcement agencies in maintaining the integrity of the nation's land borders, particularly in the more remote inland areas.

· Strengthen effective command and operational coordination arrangements with other national security agencies with particular emphasis on crisis response and the management of transnational challenges.

· Assist civil agencies to ensure the stability of the nation itself, particularly in circumstances where the scale, nature and/or immediacy of the challenge is beyond the capacity of civil agencies.

# Defending  The Nation'S Sovereignty:

![25_Image_0.Png](25_Image_0.Png) Expanding Roles In Wider Horizons

· Develop the capacity to expand in a timely fashion to deter and, if necessary respond, to more serious challenges, including the defence of the nation against any prospect of direct military coercion.

![25_image_1.png](25_image_1.png)

· Foster security relationships with neighbour countries to support the joint management and protection of shared interests and to minimise the prospect of tension or conflict.

· Cooperate closely with ASEAN nations to promote shared security understanding, transparency in the security environment, and initiatives to enhance stability in the wider Asia-Pacific context.

· Participate in the planning for, and combined response to, any major security crisis that may arise within the immediate region with little or no warning, particularly the response to natural disasters.

· Make tailored contributions to wider international efforts to promote stability and a rules-based global order, particularly United Nations' peace support and humanitarian relief operations.

Modernising the force in line with overall regional trends will be important to interoperability and force's capacity for timely expansion in the future.

# Shaping The Royal Brunei Armed Forces

"I am confident that, with sensible and balanced improvements, the Royal Brunei Armed Forces will continue to be an efficient, effective, dynamic force.

Majesty the Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Bra

![27_image_1.png](27_image_1.png)

To achieve those objectives, the more immediate priorities for the RBAF are to:
· Develop, in cooperation with other government agencies, a comprehensive recognised Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) picture.

This should seek to capture the full range of external activity impacting upon the nation's control of its territory and boundaries and enhance domain awareness on land, air and maritime. Such an integrated picture underpins the management of day-to-day affairs, the locations and discrimination of potential targets, the direct protection of national interests during tension or hostilities, and information sharing with neighbours on issues of common concerns.

government agencies
· Support other in maintaining the integrity of the nation's land borders, particularly in more remote areas or in response to evidence of more major or systematic incursions.

A consistent high level of ISR should be provided and supported by the frequent deployment of land force patrol. A sustained area presence may be required in response to specific intelligence.

Enforcement responsibility will remain primarily with civil agencies.

· Conduct surveillance and regular patrols of the nation's offshore economic and fishing zones to monitor and support civil agencies to regulate activity in those areas.

Apart from protecting its maritime territory, these activities support the safe management of intra-regional and international movement and prevent illegal activities including poaching of fish stocks, acts of piracy and other transnational crimes. A continuous presence may be required in specific areas in response to intelligence warning, an incident, or in support of cooperative regional action.

Hold selected force elements at a high level of preparedness to respond to national or regional crises that may arise at short notice.

The focus should be on those situations where the speed and/or scale of the emergency overwhelms normal civil response capabilities, particularly in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. The emphasis should be on rapid deployment, the ability (if required) to assume control of a contained area, and the provision of specialist skills such as communications, tactical transport and first line medical or engineering support.

![28_image_0.png](28_image_0.png)

Maintain the planning, command and control structure to provide military support in response to national emergencies.

Both Defence expertise in the conduct of complex operations and the substantial response assets at its disposal can make a valuable contribution to the national response. This includes maintaining both a national and a deployable tactical command centre, developing compatible communication standards and emergency procedures across government agencies, and support in developing and exercising integrated plans.

.

Participate regularly in regional military exercises, both bilaterally and multilaterally, to develop essential operational skills, habits of cooperation and coordination procedures.

Particular emphasis should be given to command and control, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, surveillance and patrol in maritime and difficult land environments, and procedures to monitor and respond to illegal movements. Command post exercises and tactical exercises without troops can be particularly valuable in testing civil-military as well as military-to-military relations.

.

Contribute to regional and wider international efforts, particularly under the United Nations mandate, to peacekeeping, stability and humanitarian operations.

While the scale of contribution may be limited, the RBAF's acceptability as a neutral but professional force reinforces its value. Participation will generally be land force and involve presence and monitoring roles. Experience in the planning and coordination of small scale operations may also be valuable. Contributions support operational experience and the development of doctrine within the RBAF.

![28_image_1.png](28_image_1.png)

![29_image_0.png](29_image_0.png)

Several additional roles, important to comprehensively equipping the RBAF to protect the national interest, can be developed more progressively. In particular, there is a need to:

## · In Supporting Other National Security Agencies, Reinforce The Capacity Of The Land Force

to protect specific infrastructure and assets, particularly in urban environments. This skill is important across the spectrum of contemporary challenges ranging from VIP
protection through the restoration of services and counter terrorism to the military defence of key national infrastructures. Important tasks include guarding duties, control of movement, cordon and search, and immediate area patrolling. Self protection and the ability to apply precise and graduated firepower, ensuring economy of force and limiting collateral damage, will be essential in circumstances of direct military threat.

## · Develop The Capacity To Effectively Control The Nation'S Sovereign Airspace.

An enhanced awareness of airspace activity and the ability to exploit that environment for one's own purposes (including surveillance and combat support), and to respond to airspace intrusions will be essential. These skills are complex. They should be introduced progressively - (i) strengthening the capacity to monitor national airspace; (ii) introducing an effective air defence system suitable to protect vital national assets; and (iii) acquiring a core air combat capability.

## · Strengthen The Rbaf Command, Control And Communications System Against Cyber Attack And Assist In Protecting The National Communications Infrastructure.

It is important that the nation implements a comprehensive response to safeguard national decision making, commercial and economic activity as well as national security capabilities.

The Ministry of Defence's primary concerns are the survivability of its own systems to ensure operational effectiveness, providing emergency communications should the national system fail, and contributing its expertise to strengthening national information capabilities.

# Promoting A Stable Environment

" ... It is necessary for the Ministry of Defence and Royal Brunei Armed Forces to build bilateral and multilateral cooperation with other countries within the concept of Defence Diplomacy.

His Majesty the Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam's Titah (Royal Speech)
in conjunction with the Royal Brunei Armed Forces Golden Jubilee Anniversary Celebration on 31 May 2011 The nature of the new security challenges makes it imperative that an effective response extends well beyond each nation's capacity to manage its own affairs.

· The scale and immediacy of natural disasters can quickly overwhelm the capacity of individual nations to respond.

· The complexity of transnational challenges requires extensive knowledge sharing and coordinated action to deny radical groups the means and the freedom to act.

· Instability within individual nations, apart from any immediate impact on neighbouring countries, can impact on a region's ability collectively to manage its own affairs.

· Concern for the security of sea lanes and access to resources provides a particular imperative for strategically located nations to assure safe movement.

· Unresolved boundaries, growing maritime capabilities, and major power relativities are reinforcing the importance of collectively managing issues arising in the South China Sea.

Close cooperation with others is essential to maximising national capacity, providing early warning of potential challenges, and undertaking a coordinated response to issues of shared concern.

## Regional Security Cooperation

In recent years, ASEAN has taken a number of important initiatives to improve the effectiveness of security cooperation both among its members and in seeking to shape the broader Asia-Pacific security context.

· The establishment of the ASEAN Regional Forum provided an important vehicle for greater transparency and promoting confidence building.

· The Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea in 2002 provided clear evidence of ASEAN's new resolve to more actively manage the security environment.

· The strengthening of the East Asia Summit, and the insistence that all participants accept the principles of the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in South East Asia, reinforced ASEAN's value as the focus for Asia-Pacific security dialogue.

· September 11 and the Bali bombings provided the initial catalyst for much more extensive practical cooperation. A web of new arrangements, both bilateral and multilateral, sought to strengthen national counter terrorist capabilities and share information and expertise on terrorism and transnational crime.

· The united response to mitigate the devastating effects of the natural disasters left no doubt not only as to the operational necessity of such cooperation but also the commitment of neighbours.

![32_image_0.png](32_image_0.png)

## Defence Diplomacy

The establishment of the ASEAN Political-Security Community, now to be achieved by 2015, builds directly upon those foundations. It provides a comprehensive, professional and practical framework for future security cooperation. It also signals a renewed ASEAN resolve to actively pursue conflict prevention, conflict resolution and post-conflict peace building measures.

· The linchpin of the new arrangements is the ASEAN Defence Ministers Meeting (ADMM).

The ADMM is supported by Senior Officers Meetings responsible for developing the practical initiatives to give effect to that cooperation.

· Studies have been undertaken of ASEAN military capacities to provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief and of how to maximise cooperation with civil agencies in responding to complex, non-traditional challenges.

· The recent introduction of the ADMM-Plus arrangements engages ASEAN's primary security partners in these initiatives, helping to promote alignment between ASEAN's security concerns and those of the broader Asia-Pacific community.

· An agenda of five initial areas for cooperation has been agreed - humanitarian assistance disaster relief, maritime security, military medicine, counter-terrorism and and peace-keeping operations. Member countries have volunteered to take the lead in their development.

While the initial agenda may appear modest, it has several important advantages.

· It gives priority to those strategic issues that are, in the immediate future, the most likely causes of instability, whether domestic or between nations.

· It assists to develop the independent capacity of nations to manage those challenges.

· It is establishing the essential elements for professional cooperation in a range of future contingencies. Developing shared doctrine and communications links and experience with joint planning and operational command and control are the essential foundations.

## Cooperative Deployments

While Brunei Darussalam's defence capabilities are relatively modest in comparison with its neighbours, its commitment to promoting security cooperation and fostering stability in the region and beyond have been clearly demonstrated.

· It has worked closely with neighbours in information exchanges and developing more effective arrangements for tackling the challenges of terrorism and transnational crime.

· The RBAF's medium lift helicopters made a valuable contribution to tactical mobility and resupply in the 2004 tsunami.

· Defence White Paper Update 2007 highlighted plans to develop the RBAF's deployable first line medical and engineering support capabilities to enhance its flexibility to contribute to those operations.

· Recent deployments in Mindanao and to Lebanon have reinforced Brunei Darussalam's image as a neutral and constructive contributor and its ability to work closely with other regional forces.

Recent peacekeeping operations have reinforced the RBAF's capacity to undertake small scale operations in difficult environments. Strengthening the RBAF's capacity to make regular, and where appropriate concurrent, contributions to stability operations whether regionally or in support of the UN will be an important aspect of future capability development and deployment planning.

· The extended range of the new patrol vessels improves force deployability and provide a much greater capacity for cooperative maritime activities.

· The planned upgrading of the helicopter fleet and acquisition of additional fixed wing aircraft will enhance the capacity for tactical mobility and resupply, particularly in response to large scale emergencies.

· The first line medical and engineering support capabilities of the land force will continue to be developed, increasing the force's potential to undertake disaster relief and reconstruction tasks.

![33_image_1.png](33_image_1.png)

Building on recent peacekeeping operations, further strengthening training and equipping the elements of the land force to undertake small unit operations in difficult environments will be a priority.

# Refining Planning And Decision Making

" ... The Royal Brunei Armed Forces has to be smart in adopting a practical approach, emphasizing on inter-agency and multi-national operations, especially in the concept of Jointly and Joint Operational Planning".

s Majesty the Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei Durussalam's Titah (Royal Speech)

![35_image_1.png](35_image_1.png)

in conjunction with the Opening Ceremony of the Command and Staff Course on 25 November 2010 An essential principle underpinning the recent development of the RBAF has been the adoption of a much more integrated approach to planning and operations. The Joint Force Commander has been appointed, the Joint Operations Centre is being developed as the nerve centre of the force, and significant progress has been made with introducing the essential C4I capabilities to underpin a networked force. Delivering joint effects is not, however, just a matter of putting the appropriate systems in place. It depends upon:
· Building the culture of cooperation and the doctrine that ultimately guide the effective delivery of military force.

· Approaching capability development in a holistic way, identifying all the elements to make sure the RBAF can deliver the desired operational effects in priority areas.

· Providing comprehensive planning guidance to underpin the development and employment of the force.

To take this next step, the RBAF is now moving to refine the ways in which it approaches joint planning, the conduct of operations, and overall capability and policy development.

## Joint Planning

The primary focus for joint planning at present is the strategic level direction provided by the Defence Executive Committee. It is the key decision making body and responsible for the overall management of Defence. Below that level, however, many elements of planning within the Ministry and the RBAF have in the past been developed independently.

To support the development of more comprehensive and integrated guidance with respect to operations, a Joint Planning Committee (JPC) is to be established. The JPC will support and translate the decisions of the Defence Executive Committee into operational terms. Its primary responsibilities among others will be to:
· Develop Defence-wide planning operational guidance.

· Establish the objectives to be achieved in each area. · Monitor activities and progress in relation to them.

· Report to the Defence Executive Committee on their achievement.

The principal areas of guidance will be:
· Oversight of the development of joint force and related single Service doctrine.

# Defending The Nation'S Sovereignty:

![36_Image_0.Png](36_Image_0.Png) Expanding Roles In Wider Horizons

· A comprehensive annual exercise program mapping single and joint Service training activities against the force's primary operational roles.

· Reviewing the outcomes of the exercise program and operational deployment to guide future development.

· Establishing and monitoring preparedness benchmarks for each of the Services.

· Planning for significant operational deployments.

· Arrangements for cooperation with civil agencies including information exchanges and operational coordination.

To support these developments, the planning capacity of the Joint Force Commander will be strengthened by establishing a dedicated force planning unit. This will be:
· Staffed by a senior planning officer nominated by each of the three Services.

· Responsible for doctrine development .

· Drawing together the Services inputs to develop that more integrated guidance.

· Acting as the secretariat for the JPC.

## Integrated Capability Development

To complement the enhancement of joint operational planning, Defence's capability development processes have in recent years become progressively more sophisticated.

· The operational roles identified in Defending the Nation's Sovereignty provide a consistent basis for planning. There is much more rigour in tying capability proposals to the concept for their employment.

· The Directorate of Force Capability Development (DFCD) has undertaken extensive work in

![36_image_1.png](36_image_1.png)

modelling future scenarios and introduced a longer term perspective to capability analysis.

· The Centre of Science and Technology Research and Development (CSTRAD)
has brought critical expertise. New capability proposals are weighing not only the requirements of the force-in-being but the scope for new technologies to increase force efficiency and effectiveness and alternative approaches to achieving operational outcomes.

Existing capability development processes were, however, developed before those more sophisticated inputs were available. Several recent projects have demonstrated the potential for project definition to incorporate the full range of strategic, operational, technological and resource considerations.

![37_image_0.png](37_image_0.png)

Capability can be approached in a much more holistic sense including the manning and support of systems, their operational flexibility and the capacity to enhance platform potential in the context of strategic or technological developments. Optimising that process is essential.

· A range of existing capabilities are reaching effective life-of-type. · New operational demands are being generated by the changing strategic environment.

· Delivering joint effects will be critical to maximising the ability of the RBAF to achieve national defence objectives.

· Project management expertise needs to be strengthened to ensure performance and delivery targets are achieved.

To achieve these objectives, a more integrated approach to capability development is being introduced under the oversight of a newly established Defence Capability Committee. The key elements in the new approach will be:
· A comprehensive review of the force-in-being and the level of performance it is presently able to generate in each capability area - this 'stocktake' of operational effectiveness to be repeated at five yearly intervals.

· The preparation of an overall capability development plan bringing together the scenario analysis and concept development undertaken by DFCD with the technological and the capability analysis expertise residing within CSTRAD.

· Drafting of a human resources strategy for the force incorporating manpower projections, recruitment, training development needs and conditions of service.

· The introduction of a prioritised and fully costed rolling five year force development program to give effect to capability development plan.

## Strengthening Policy Advice

Achieving those operational and capability outcomes, providing comprehensive advice to government on specific deployments and pursuing effective defence diplomacy requires a capacity to provide robust policy advice.

Several important initiatives have been taken to strengthening the level of policy and planning expertise within Defence.

· The development of the Scholars Program has established a valuable foundation, equipping a cohort with prospective young policy officers with a range of academic skills from leading overseas universities.

· The Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies (SHHBIDSS) will continue to provide research and analysis across a range of security related issues including regional developments and trends in military capabilities and acquisitions.

· The creation of CSTRAD has injected essential scientific and technological expertise, strengthened the knowledge base for capability development and contributing directly to the assessment and management of projects.

![38_image_0.png](38_image_0.png)

Realising the robust planning objectives set out in this White Paper will require a more focused approach, closely integrating policy related research and its practical application. Enhanced regional cooperation and the complexities of more frequent force deployments demand a comprehensive policy foundation if sensitivities are to be managed and the national interest maximised.

The foundation for this comprehensive approach to policy will be:
· The consolidation of related areas of policy development under the Permanent Secretary for policy.

· Restructuring of the defence policy responsibilities to align closely with the strategic priorities shaping security engagement and the development and employment of the RBAF.

In particular, the functions of the existing Directorate of Defence Policy will be divided into two distinct areas.

· The first will be responsible for strategic engagement. It will develop policy for and lead national participation in non-operational activities both regionally and internationally. Support will be provided to officers participating in the ASEAN Defence Ministers Meetings, the related senior officers' meeting and expert working groups and, as required, to the parallel military-to-military exchanges.

· The second, responsible for defence policy and strategic intelligence, will develop more holistic policy guidance. It will develop strategic assessments of longer term trends affecting the nation's security, complementing the operational focus of the Directorate of Intelligence. It will develop more detailed policy to guide the implementation of the White Paper's recommendations. It will support planning for specific operational deployments and prepare policy options to form the national response.

· The research being undertaken by the SHHBIDSS will provide an important input to those assessments. While the maintenance of an independent research program will be essential across a range of defence and security related areas, background studies to support policy development may be specifically commissioned.

An important consequence of these changes will be a strengthening of the policy expertise within the Ministry, building upon recent initiatives to foster the number of talented young officers through the Scholars Program.

# Maximising Force Effectiveness

![39_image_0.png](39_image_0.png)

Defending The Nation's Sovereignty:

![40_image_0.png](40_image_0.png) EXPANDING ROLES IN WIDER HORIZONS

# Maximising Force Effectiveness

"In addition to measures to gain knowledge, honing skills, acquiring equipment and building infrastructure, I would like to emphasise here the importance of possessing effective leaders must have vision to make improvements, apart from having the ability to overcome any weaknesses.

His Majesty the Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam's Titah (Royal Speech)
in conjunction with the Royal Brunel Armed Forces 47th Anniversary Celebration on 31 May 2008 The enduring characteristics of Brunei Darussalam's strategic geography, the breadth of potential tasks, the compact size of the force and the need to be able to respond to developments at short notice place a premium on maximising force effectiveness. Preparedness and sustainability, the well targeted employment of technology, and a high level of professionalism are essential to achieving that outcome.

## Preparedness

In the contemporary environment, an early response is often critical to operational success. It can:
· Alleviate the most severe effects of a disaster.

· Engage a fleeting target.

· Ease tensions between parties.

· Demonstrate national resolve. · Allow particular operational outcomes to be achieved in the most resource efficient manner.

Tangible commitments to regional cooperation whether for humanitarian purposes or to counter illegal transnational activity must be delivered quickly.

Preparedness is not just a question of the readiness of equipment. It involves the availability of personnel, up-to-date training and operational concepts, dedicated combat support, equipment and supplies, and mobility of assets. The Balanced Scorecard developed by the Office of Strategic Management of the Ministry of Defence as a defence management tool ensures that the RBAF remains at the highest level of readiness to respond to any situation.

Important benchmarks have already been put in place to measure and enhance the RBAF's preparedness. They test the availability of the various force elements to be able to respond to more immediate challenges as well as their capacity to be enhanced for more complex and demanding

![40_image_1.png](40_image_1.png)

operations. The priority for several of the capability enhancements identified in this White Paper stems from those judgments. The capacity to sustain forces once deployed is essential. With respect to ground force deployments, the provision of support services and, during extended commitments, the rotation of personnel is critical. For naval and air platforms, operational reliability and the ability to maintain rates of effort are critical. A
comprehensive logistic support plan is being developed.

![41_image_0.png](41_image_0.png)

Preparedness judgments must, however, balance the need for readiness to deploy against the more fundamental training, exercising and skills development essential to high levels of professionalism and effectiveness across a range of possible tasks. To achieve that balance, initial response elements have been identified within each of the Services able to be deployed at short notice should circumstances require. Those high readiness assets are assigned to the Joint Force Commander who maintains the national surveillance picture, exercises operational command, and is the initial point of contact for other national and regional forces. The primary force elements currently maintained at full preparedness are:
· An infantry company and associated tactical and support elements.

· An offshore and an inshore patrol vessel (either or both of which may be conducting national patrol operations).

· A flight of four medium lift helicopters.

This responsibility is to be rotated on a regular basis within the major force elements. Where a particular asset is deployed for current operations beyond the nation and its immediate surrounds, and/or is unavailable for rapid redeployment, an equivalent force element will be brought to full preparedness. As some deployments, particularly those for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, may require greater strategic reach, standing agreements will be developed with both the national carrier and regional partners to facilitate those commitments.

## Technology And Industry

Developments in technology are significantly improving the ability of military forces to integrate their operations, identify targets and apply fire power precisely. In a compact force, those qualities are potentially a valuable multiplier of combat power. Leading edge systems generally attract, however, a substantial resource premium.

At the same time, proven technologies often promise enhanced reliability. Civil specifications in areas such as surveillance and information technologies, including communications and networking, are increasingly able to satisfy priority operational requirements at a modest cost. They can also be more easily supported by the national industry base. Defence must be a smart buyer.

To balance these imperatives in operational design and new capability specifications, Darussalam has strengthened its Brunei capacity in defence science and technology.

· The Centre of Science, Technology Research and Development has introduced important expertise, promoting awareness of current and prospective developments. Its work supports informed judgments of options for satisfying operational needs and the

![41_image_1.png](41_image_1.png)

interrelationship between performance and cost.

![42_image_0.png](42_image_0.png)

· Simulation offers an important avenue for testing operational concepts and capability solutions and for the cost effective training of skilled operators. The National Modelling and Simulation Centre currently being established will provide a national capacity in this area that can be accessed for defence purposes. That expertise may also contribute to cooperative planning with other regional nations and defence forces.

· More broadly, progress has been made since the 2004 Defence White Paper with transferring the responsibility for non-combat support and services from Defence to the private sector. Civil contractors provide valuable communications and information technology support to Defence and its links with the broader national security infrastructure.

Many technological solutions are, however, developed against a background of direct combat engagement between larger forces and their applicability to national circumstances may be limited. The focus of future development of the nation's technological and industrial base must be on applying those advances to meet national priorities.

Future developments will give emphasis targeting specific national needs.

· A future priority for CSTRAD's work will be close collaboration with defence industry, both national and international, to explore capability solutions in the areas most critical to effective RBAF's operations.

· Consideration of the national capacity to provide intermediate maintenance will be an element in all future major equipment contracts. Immediate operational support to the force is critical to mission achievement and must be retained within the RBAF.

· A legal environment specifically focused on encouraging growth in defence industry, partnerships with national companies, and innovative investment strategies will be introduced.

BRIDEX, Brunei Darussalam's international defence exhibition, provides an important opportunity for defence manufacturers to showcase technologies and systems particularly suited to the regional environment. It also fosters links between those manufacturers and local small to medium enterprises.

![43_image_0.png](43_image_0.png)

![43_image_1.png](43_image_1.png)

## Human Resource Development

Military operations are however, and will continue to be, a very human endeavour.

· The frequency and complexity of stability operations and the new transnational challenges have set aside the more exaggerated predictions as to how emerging technologies might transform the future battlefield.

· Brunei Darussalam's demanding geography and its commitment to operations to contain instability and resolve tensions reinforce the essentiality of highly trained and skilled soldiers.

a comprehensive training Introducing and development framework has been an important element of recent policy initiatives.

· The Training Institute offers a robust six months initial training program and an evolving range of specialist courses. The latter give a particular emphasis to the skills required of ground forces in complex environments and initiatives are being pursued to strengthening the sharing of regional experience in this area. The Institute also hosts the School of Infantry, providing advanced training for the infantry.

· Small unit operations, particularly in jungle environments, remain a primary focus of RBAF's training. To contribute to regional capacity building, an important objective of the Training Institute will be develop itself as a centre of excellence for small unit operations in complex and/or difficult environments.

· Technical training continues to be provided primarily by the individual Services in association with local educational institutions to support their specific operational and maintenance requirements. Developing that skill base will be reviewed in preparing the future capability development plan. The future development of a Joint Warfare School will provide a valuable extension to this training.

Establishment of the Defence Academy represents a major step forward.

· It offers a well-structured program of courses for junior to mid-ranking officers at each step in their career progression.

· Close cooperation with universities complements professional military education.

· The Officer Cadet Course is followed by the Leadership and Management Program and, most recently the Command and Staff Course.

These in-country programs are complemented by a vigorous program of exchanges with staff colleges throughout the Asia-Pacific and in Europe. In addition to their value in promoting military-to-military cooperation and transparency, the comparative perspectives they provide offer important insights for the further refinement of national programs.

![44_image_0.png](44_image_0.png)

The pool of civilian policy skills and specialist planning expertise is being fostered through the Scholars Program. The research being undertaken by SHHBIDSS will provide a valuable source of information and analysis to support Defence education. Its Executive Development Program (EDP) supports the professional development of middle level officers.

The numerically small size of the RBAF makes the effective utilisation of the Reserve Force an important consideration. The value of being able to round out ground force elements in particular within available warning was reinforced in the recent major exercise. More substantial and on-going reliance upon a Reserve contribution does introduce significant legal and resource considerations.

The 2004 White Paper identified the potential advantages of focusing the potential Reserve contribution on specific roles, including the organisation of large scale events and the protection of national infrastructure. These were numerically demanding roles but required a more focused set of operational skills than larger scale infantry manoeuvres. More comprehensive planning for the use of the Reserves will be an important task for the new Joint Planning Committee.

# Enhancing Capability

![45_image_0.png](45_image_0.png)

![46_image_0.png](46_image_0.png)

# Enhancing Capability

"As a small Armed Force, there is a need to balance any deficiencies with the ability to master the technology that acts as a force multiplier. This can only be achieved by valuing the role of leadership and skilled personnel."
His Majesty the Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam's Titah (Royal Speech)

![46_image_1.png](46_image_1.png)

in conjunction with the Royal Brunei Armed Forces Golden Jubilee Anniversary Celebration on 31 May 2011 The capacity to identify and quickly deploy appropriate force elements to engage potential targets lies at the core of the RBAF's ability to effectively exploit its operational environment. Further enhancement of both situational awareness and force deployability is essential to optimising that capacity. More frequent and varied commitments to security cooperation activities are strengthening the need to be able to operate in complex environments. Future planning for capability development reflects these imperatives.

## Maritime And Land Surveillance

Transparency of the operational environment is essential to the early identification of security challenges and a timely response. The capacity of the RBAF to achieve this has been primarily focused at the tactical level.

Expanding the force's capacity for more continuous broad area coverage both in maritime areas and to monitor developments along the nation's more remote land borders is the immediate priority for capability development.

Initial progress has already been made in the maritime environment with the introduction of the much more capable Navy patrol vessels. Their extended range and sea keeping support a continuous presence in adjacent waters.

Developing that capacity further will be achieved through several key initiatives. They include:
· The acquisition of the planned surface surveillance radar to provide continuous, all-weather surveillance of movements in the more immediate maritime approaches.

· Purchase of additional fixed wing aircraft with enhanced sensors will transform the maritime surveillance capability currently provided by the Air Force's CN-235.

· The availability of a modular sensor suite capable of being fitted to the new medium lift helicopters.

Together, these capabilities will substantially increase the RBAF's ability to conduct surveillance operations throughout the nation's maritime zones and to provide more detailed coverage of specific areas. Coverage of potentially illegal activities across the nation's land borders is made difficult by their remoteness, the difficult terrain and the jungle canopy. A consistent high level of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) needs to be provided closely integrated with land force patrols. A sustained presence in specific areas may be required in response to specific intelligence.

Initiatives to further strengthen this capacity include the introduction of:
· An enhanced sensor suite for patrolling helicopters, including infra-red and thermal imaging capabilities.

![47_image_0.png](47_image_0.png)

![47_image_1.png](47_image_1.png)

· More flexible operational concepts.

· Improved tactical surveillance capabilities for ground force patrols to enhance their situational awareness of areas of operations.

A study of the potential of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles to further strengthen coverage of both the maritime and land border environments will be undertaken by CSTRAD as an input to the future capability development plan. Surveillance of the national airspace is currently provided only by civilian radar although the interlinking of regional control systems provides a quite comprehensive coverage of major aircraft movements.

## Command, Control And Communications

The comprehensive networking of all force elements continues to be an important objective for the RBAF.

The rapid and secure passage of information ties together operational and tactical surveillance inputs to establish a shared operational picture. It supports the identification of response options, early and integrated decision making, and the direction of assets to meet the challenge.

Development of the Joint Force Headquarters has been the catalyst for significant progress in this area.

· The Joint Operations Centre has become the nerve centre of the networked force with the capacity to fuse information from a wide range of sources.

· The secure voice communications network is now capable of supporting all operational and tactical level deployments, linking the Joint Operation Centre to the Service headquarters and to individual combat platforms and vehicles.

· Links to the National Disaster Management and the Police Operations Centre are established and planning well advanced in relation to the new Maritime Coordination Centre.

The introduction of the Navy's new patrol vessels provides the opportunity to extend this further. The capacity for the rapid transfer of data and visual images from air and naval assets and from deployed land force headquarters will be a priority as each new capability is introduced into service. While those systems are key to maximising the combat power of a small force, the development of the associated doctrine and procedures and practical experience in their employment are essential to realising that potential.

· Joint force doctrine has now been issued and a specific training program introduced to promote familiarity and practical experience with the new system.

· Developing these skills will be a specific requirement for all joint force exercise activities.

· A series of desk top command exercises will also be conducted to strengthen system knowledge among other government agencies and senior decision makers.

![48_image_0.png](48_image_0.png)

An emerging challenge to national security is the danger of information warfare or cyber attack, Potentially national economies and decision making can be paralysed by the disruption of the nation's communications system without any requirement for the deployment of force. The increasing interdependence of national and regional economies makes that an unlikely prospect unless accompanied by a significant deterioration in relationships.

The possibility of attacks by sub-state actors or attempts to access classified government or commercial information can be expected to increase. This is not primarily a Defence responsibility. Strengthening of defence's own systems against that threat is, however, essential. Maintaining a survivable Defence communications network able to withstand major physical damage, including natural disaster, or a more concerted information attack is an important national asset.

## Force Mobility

The mobility requirements for the RBAF in the national context are primarily tactical. The difficult terrain in much of the country places a premium on movement by air or water. The commitment of forces to cooperative regional activities and to peacekeeping has, however, increased the frequency of strategic deployments. Further extension of the nation's involvement in stability operations will strengthen the need to provide protected mobility for ground forces.

Early upgrading of the force's mobility assets is a priority.

· Apart from the ground force's fleet of wheeled vehicles, the core mobility assets are the Bell 212 and 214 medium lift helicopters, which are capable of company group lift, and the Navy's landing craft.

· Those capabilities are essential to the rapid deployment and support of forces operating in the nation's hinterland. They are now reaching operational life-of-type and early replacement is required to support operational reliability and contain maintenance costs.

· The acquisition of fast, manoeuvrable shallow water craft to patrol the Bay of Brunei and the river estuaries will significantly enhance the ability of the land force to patrol the hinterland and intercept incursions.

![48_image_1.png](48_image_1.png)

# Defending The Nation'S Sovereignty: Expanding Roles In Wider Horizons

![49_Image_0.Png](49_Image_0.Png)

![49_Image_1.Png](49_Image_1.Png)

The responsibility for riverine mobility and developing the associated operational concepts will be transferred to the land force.

Judgments in relation to strategic mobility are more complex.

· The introduction of a larger fixed wing transport aircraft would provide greater flexibility in the nature and scale of contributions further afield
· Allied or commercial capabilities will generally be available to support such deployment should the need arise.

At the same time, developments in other areas of capability are enhancing the capacity of the force in this area.

· The new offshore patrol vessels have the size and range to deploy at greater distance, either contributing in their own right or transporting a specialist ground force element. The provision of a helicopter deck on the larger vessels provides enhanced operational flexibility.

The acquisition of a strategic transport aircraft remains, however, an important priority for future acquisition.

More immediately, there are two additional imperatives for upgrading the land force's capacity for protected mobility.

· The commitment of troops to stability and peacekeeping operations is anticipated at least in the short to medium term to be an on-going feature of RBAF operations.

· The fragile nature of potential scenarios and any steps to strengthen the value of this role in international engagement increases the possibility that the deployed force will need to operate in more complex and dangerous environments.

· There is a requirement to develop the skills, concepts and doctrine for the planned mechanisation of one of the existing infantry battalions. Tailoring the nature of that capability to national circumstances will be important.

Introducing an upgraded armoured personnel carrier capability at company level with the ability to protect personnel against the range of threats, including improvised explosive devices, currently being experienced in peace operations will enhance the nation's ability to contribute to those collective tasks. It will also provide the nucleus for developing the skills and doctrine for the planned mechanisation of one of the battalions.

## Protection And Firepower

The ultimate responsibility of a defence force is, of course, to be prepared to go in harm's way if necessary to defend the nation and its interests. The RBAF has the capacity to respond to a range of lower level hostilities assessed to be the most likely strategic scenarios in the immediate future. At the same time, there are several important reasons why progressive enhancement of the force's capability in these areas is important.

![50_image_0.png](50_image_0.png)

· There is the ever present risk of either miscalculation or unexpectedly escalation in a tactical engagement. Developments in overall regional capabilities and the availability of sophisticated weaponry to non-state actors leave no room for complacency.

· Units deployed for peace monitoring and stability operations need to be equipped with weapons for self protection, light weight body armour and tactical surveillance equipment.

· For collective security operations, force elements will operate most effectively together where they share similar levels of technology and have the flexibility to undertake a range of tasks.

Development of the RBAF should seek to maintain its operational value in the context of comparable regional enhancements. In the maritime environment, the Navy's new patrol vessels incorporate upgraded survivability and self protection measures and a significant enforcement capacity against smaller vessels. The vessels have the potential to be upgraded to counter subsurface or airborne threats in the future. The capacity of the land force for more significant engagements is, however, limited due to the extended operational life of its major combat assets. To improve its flexibility across the spectrum of conflict, including options for contributing to peace and stability operations and the ability to protect national assets and infrastructure, the land force is to be progressively hardened and its ability to deliver precision firepower upgraded.

The important first steps will be:
· Developing the capacity for company level protected mobility as noted previously. · Introducing more potent short-to-medium range direct firepower at both unit and squadron level.

To support system commonality, variants of the mobility armoured personnel carrier will be considered to replace the existing light tank. That capability will be a valuable test bed for plans to develop a fully mechanised battalion, allowing the concept to be tailored to the particular characteristics of the nation's operational environment. The introduction of more comprehensive indirect firepower will be considered subsequently. Introducing a comprehensive air defence capability is a complex task that cannot be achieved quickly. While the prospect of such a threat is currently remote, knowledge of unauthorised air movements is important to a wide spectrum of security challenges. Possessing the ability to identify and, if necessary, engage hostile aircraft provides a more secure environment for the conduct of a range of military operations.

Enhancement of the national capacity for airspace control will be achieved progressively. The important steps will be:
· Improved access to the existing civil airspace control system.

· The acquisition of an integrated mobile air defence radar to develop doctrine and provide more detailed coverage of specific operational areas should tensions arise in the future.

· The introduction of a surface based defence capability, both maritime and land based.

Possession of the latter capability would have an important deterrent effect.

# Looking Beyond Tomorrow

"The RBAF's primary task is to preserve the peace, and, thankfill to Allah, this is becoming a reality. However, we must remember complacency is always our omnipresent enemy. If we are a little bit complacent it can lead to disaster or calamity.

Is it not that despite the peace, yet there is uncertainty with the possible existence of unexpected threats?

His Majesty the Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei Danussalam's Titah (Royal Speech)
in conjunction with the Royal Brunci Armod Forces 49th Anniversary Celebration on 31 May 2010 Recent strategic developments place a high priority on the ability of the RBAF to deliver important operational effects today, whether in support of the national interest or to promote a stable security environment in cooperation with others. The initiatives set out in this White Paper will significantly enhance that capacity.

Importantly, they also provide the essential foundations for a robust defence of the nation and its direct interests should strategic circumstances deteriorate at some point in the future. The RBAF's operational effectiveness will be underpinned by:
· Strengthened joint command and control. · Surveillance and reconnaissance to establish a transparent operational environment.

· Joint force exercising and doctrine development.

· High levels of military professionalism based on a comprehensive training and development system.

· Capabilities benchmarked against those of neighbouring countries to facilitate combined operations where interests overlap.

Developing the advanced combat capabilities that would be necessary in such circumstances to deter and if necessary respond to aggression cannot, however, be accomplished quickly.

Importantly:
· The new weapons systems must be acquired and introduced into service.

· Extensive capability-specific training and doctrine development must be undertaken.

· Associated combat support infrastructure must be developed.

Beyond the immediate priorities established in this White Paper, the progressive strengthening of the RBAF's combat capabilities is important. Particular areas that would be essential to the depth and robustness of national defence in those circumstances include:
· An enhanced capacity for more active control of national airspace, including in the immediate maritime approaches. This would be important not only to deterring and responding to air space intrusion but also to providing close air support to maritime and land forces.

· Strengthening for the forces' capabilities in underwater warfare, in a contingency, this would significantly increase its ability to offer protection to shipping and protect the immediate approaches to the nation.

· Increasing the combat effectiveness of the individual soldier through the training concepts and equipment embodied in contemporary planning for the next generation soldier.

· Expanding the engagement envelope of the land force through the addition of medium to longer range firepower. This would ensure more defensive depth to key national infrastructures and support effective force manoeuvre.

Current strategic circumstances do not place these capabilities ahead of the priorities identified earlier in this White Paper. They are not, however, capabilities that can be acquired overnight. To be in a position to develop those aspects of combat power within a 10 to 15 year timeframe, if required, planning for their introduction and developing a core capability to facilitate future expansion does need to be undertaken.

Specific capability areas that would be most important, given the nation's strategic geography and interests, are:
· An air interdiction capability including the introduction of versatile fighter aircrafts. · More comprehensive protection capabilities for the maritime force, particularly for underwater warfare and mine counter-measures.

· Further strengthening the Land Force's capacity for protected manoeuvre and delivering layered fire power.

Developing an ordered program for these longer term capability developments should be an important part of the overall capability development plan being developed by the new Defence Capability Committee.

# A Comprehensive Transformation

"In this global era, the Royal Brunei Armed Forces the Armed Forces to be more courageous and vigilant. It must continue to keep abreast with ca His Majesty the Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam's Titah (Royal Speech)
action with the Opening Ceremony of the Command and Staff Course on 25 November 2010 Defending the Nation's Sovereignty: Expanding Roles in Wider Horizons is very much a contemporary document. It captures the security challenges currently and prospectively confronting the nation. It provides a clear roadmap as to how defence policy initiatives and the actions and the capabilities of the RBAF will defend the nation and its interests in the future.

At the same time, the conclusions that it reaches reflect the comprehensive transformation that has occurred in the RBAF since its original establishment as the Brunei Malay Regiment on 31 May 1961.

· The then small infantry force of three companies had to wait three years until it was able to deploy to a home barracks. Modest naval and air mobility were introduced shortly afterwards but the force's roles were confined primarily to the development and security of the nation itself.

·  It was ten years before the Boat Squadron gained a limited capacity to control coastal waters, a second infantry battalion was only formed in 1975, and a further five years elapsed before the Air Wing gained a second helicopter squadron.

From the late 1970s, a series of significant enhancements occurred in the size, combat power and organisation of the armed forces.

· The Navy acquired more formidable missile equipped patrol craft.

· The Land Force's firepower and reconnaissance capability was boosted with the purchase of the Scorpion light tank and Rapier surface to air missile.

· A fixed wing training capability complemented the Air Force's new Bell 212 helicopters, establishing the foundations for a future air defence capability.

The formal establishment of the Royal Brunei Armed Forces on 17 September 1991 with a distinct Land Force, Navy and Air Force reflected this new robustness and provided a clear framework for future development in each of the Services.

What was missing from the equation was a more holistic approach maximising the overall effectiveness of what still remained a compact force to defend the nation and its interests.

.

The increasing complexity of the post-Cold War strategic environment, the necessity to more actively manage the nation's security interests, and the prospective need to replace the forces' major combat capabilities to maintain its operational effectiveness reinforced that need.

# Defending The Nation'S Sovereignty:

![56_Image_0.Png](56_Image_0.Png) Expanding Roles In Wider Horizons

The 2004 Defence White Paper, Defending the Nation's Sovereignty, laid the basis for that more comprehensive and independent approach. The White Paper:
· Recognised the essential features of Brunei Darussalam's strategic environment.

· Identified the essential roles and tasks that the RBAF
would need to undertake across the spectrum of contingencies.

- Highlighted the importance of both greater

transparency in the operational environment and of the command and control links to maximise force effectiveness.

· Introduced a more holistic approach to capability that recognised the roles of other agencies, the value of combat support and the national infrastructure, and the necessity for highly trained personnel.

Shaping the Force Today, the 2007 Defence White Paper Update, took this framework an important step further.

· It established clear and detailed priorities for future development.

· Networking the force, strengthening control of the maritime environment, and a comprehensive professional development were assessed to be essential to future force effectiveness.

· The importance of contributing to crisis response, stability promotion and shared security challenges - that is, the active management of the nation's strategic future - was clearly identified.

This White Paper delivers on that vision. Its recommendations tie together those important new strengths, maximising the ability of the RBAF to undertake priority national tasks through both the timeliness of the response and an enhanced capacity to match forces to task.

Essential to achieving those objectives are:
· The greater transparency of the strategic and particularly the operational environment. · The preparedness of the force to respond based on both an holistic approach to capability and improved force mobility.

· Strengthening the ability of key force elements to deliver tailored effects in complex operating environments.

The more comprehensive planning framework being introduced will support and help to refine those force characteristics. Importantly, the White Paper's recommendations will not only strengthen the force's ability to provide for the direct security of the nation both independently and, where appropriate, in coordination with the civil enforcement agencies.

They will provide a flexible range of capabilities able to contribute constructively to crisis management and stability operations both regionally and beyond. The capacity and willingness of nations to contribute will be important to shaping the future environment.

At the same time, strengthening the ability to deliver capability and operational outcomes in this way is by no means the end of the journey. As a number of the specific recommendations suggest, future developments will be seeking to develop the capacity of the RBAF further in two important areas.

They are:
· Strategic reach - the ability to deploy and support a range of force elements at distance, further enhancing the nation's ability to contribute more frequently and constructively to shared strategic tasks.

· Robustness - building the capacity of the force to operate in more demanding operational environments, including greater force protection and the ability to deliver precise and graduated firepower.

The innovative use of technology, it can be expected, will be critical to achieving those objectives.

Strategic circumstances may change in the future. From a national perspective, however, that future can be approached with confidence.

· Current policy is well-matched to the nation's fundamental strategic characteristics. · The integrated planning and command and control arrangements have been developed to maximise the RBAF's operational effectiveness, independently, nationally and in support of wider interests.

· The initiatives set out in this paper will further strengthen the RBAF's capacity to deliver those benefits in the national interest, responding to the more immediate challenges and guarding against the prospect of any future deterioration in the security outlook.
