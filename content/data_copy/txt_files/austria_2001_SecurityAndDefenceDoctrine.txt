# Resolution by the Austrian Parliament


## Security and Defence Doctrine


**General Considerations**


The expert draft of the analytic part of the Security and Defence Doctrine, which was
approved by the Federal Government on 23 January 2001 and forwarded to the
National Assembly for deliberation, has led to the following conclusions:

Security in all its dimensions is the basic pre-requisite for the existence and
functioning of a democracy under the rule of law as well as for the economic welfare
of the community and its citizens. Security policy is therefore a high-priority task for
any government. Under the conditions existing today, it must be conceived and
implemented as a “comprehensive security policy”.

Austria is committed to a policy of peace and undertakes everything possible to avoid
outbreaks of violent conflicts. It therefore pursues a security policy designed to avoid
war and to foster peaceful relations among nations based on the Charter of the
United Nations and international agreements to protect fundamental rights and
freedoms, such as the European Convention on Human Rights and the European
Charter of Fundamental Rights.

The purpose of security policy is to ensure security as far as possible for all sectors
of a community. The Security and Defence Doctrine particularly addresses those
aspects of comprehensive security which relate to the protection of the system of
government as a whole and to the protection of its citizens against large-scale
threats. The importance of other areas of security is not diminished thereby. The
Security and Defence Doctrine is the guideline for Austria’s security policy.

Austria’s vital security interests and the security interests pursued in common with
the EU constitute the basis of our security policy. The politico-strategic objectives
have been derived from this concept and are to be achieved through a national
overall strategy and through appropriate sub-strategies in each policy sector.

The security situation of a European state today can no longer be considered in
isolation. Instabilities and dangers in Europe or at the European periphery affect the
security situation of all European states. The new challenges and risks to security
policy cannot be dealt with by individual states alone, but only through international
co-operation in the spirit of solidarity.

The security of Austria and that of the EU are inseparably linked. Austria today
implements its security policy essentially within the framework of the EU.


-----

One important aspect of a comprehensive perception of security is the fact that
security is not only one of the responsibilities of the state, but of the entire population.
Therefore, great attention must be paid to developing a general security awareness.


Paradigm shift in security policy in Europe


The changes in global politics after the end of the Cold War have led to a
fundamental transformation of European security policy. There has been a paradigm
shift in security policy in Europe. This process, which started with the end of the Cold
War (1989), has initiated a transition from thinking in terms of military balance and
deterrence to an understanding of comprehensive and co-operative security.

The bipolar world order with a relatively constant and hence transparent constellation
of power and threats has been replaced by a new lack of transparency of the world
order and new challenges to security policy. The global security policy situation is
marked by a growing number of global players, government and above all nongovernment, some of whom remain outside the traditional political system and act
outside accepted norms of law. Hence the security situation is becoming less and
less transparent and predictable.

Geographical distance from areas of conflict no longer guarantees sufficient
protection.

At present, no aggressive political intentions are perceivable in Europe, nor are there
sufficient military capabilities for strategic offensives. Any responsible security policy
must, however, be prepared for an eventual change in political intentions and
constellations.

A modern and forward looking security policy seeks to prevent emerging risks and
threats through preventive action. It is primarily led by considerations of how Europe
can and must be shaped, so that threats do not arise in the first place.

The instruments of security policy action have received a new weighting. In
particular, the following instruments of co-operation and policy-making are employed
today: political, military, police, intelligence, economic, social, educational, cultural,
informational and communicational, ecological and internal security instruments.

Peace and stability in Europe are based on the co-operation among European states
in the framework of various security organisations. In this context, the zone of high
stability already formed by the EU and NATO is being extended through the
enlargement process step by step to those states which meet the requirements to
become members of these two organisations.

For the future of Europe, the evolution of the EU and of NATO in terms of security
policy will specifically be of vital significance. Other important factors will be the
engagement of the US in Europe and the development of Russia’s security relations
with the EU and NATO.

The individual states are the decision makers and the central actors of security
policy. The ultimate decision in questions of security policy lies with the
democratically legitimated national political institutions.


-----

Security Risks and Dangers replace clear Threat Scenarios


The clearly perceivable threat scenario of the Cold War era has been replaced by a
complex mix of dangers and risks. Its origins may lie in the political, economic,
military, social, ecological, cultural-religious and information technology areas.

From today’s point of view, wars among states can be ruled out in Western Europe
for the foreseeable future. In the unstable regions of Europe, however, or on its
periphery, the danger of conflicts being fought out by force of arms continues to exist.
Especially in case of a failure of economic and political stabilisation measures, the
possibility of the escalation of political disputes even into armed conflicts must be
reckoned with. In the medium and long term perspective, threats through the spillover
of armed conflicts from the regions bordering on Europe cannot be excluded either.

In case of radically changed political intentions, a residual military risk should also be
taken into account. This can be considered small at present, in view of the deterrent
effect exerted by NATO.

On the other hand, other forms of threats are on the increase. The most important
global challenges to security policy are the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, terrorism controlled by governments or certain interest groups and
operating internationally, organised crime, destabilising developments in armaments,
ethnic conflicts, phenomena of political fragmentation, totalitarian ideologies and
fundamentalist religions, demographic trends and migration, problems of energy and
resources, problems of food supply, and environmental hazards. Especially
international terrorism in all its manifestations is a serious security problem for
Western societies.

A comprehensive conception of security includes the following basic strategies:
promotion, safeguarding and restoration of peace and stability as well as individual
and/or collective self-defence under the following fundamental principle: “As much
co-operative promotion of peace as possible and only as much force as necessary.”
The use of military force remains a measure of last resort and may only be applied in
accordance with the principles of the United Nations.


Austria’s security situation


Austria’s current security situation is characterised by a number of positive factors.
These include in particular its internal stability based on the rule of law, democracy
and economic prosperity, the fact that Austria is embedded in the solidarity
community of the EU, and the good relations with its neighbouring countries. The
enlargement processes of the EU and NATO also have positive effects on Austria’s
geo-political situation.

An act of aggression with conventional forces against Austria, threatening its
existence, is only conceivable in case of a radical strategic change in the political
situation in Europe; for such a case, present military strategic assessments would
expect a lead-time of 7 to 10 years. Notwithstanding its present low degree of
probability, it cannot, however, be ruled out altogether.


-----

With regard to internal security, it is safe to say that the stable economic, social and
political conditions in Austria have in the past years spared Austria any extremist
movements posing a serious threat to the State’s security. The danger of
domestically motivated political terrorism is non-existent in Austria at present.

Nevertheless, there are potential risks and dangers that might alter Austria’s security

policy situation quickly and decisively


As a result of complex and trans-border configurations of threats and risks,
geographical distance from crisis regions no longer offers adequate protection.
Hence, conflicts arising outside the consolidated part of Europe may have negative
repercussions also on Austria. These include in particular international terrorism,
trafficking in arms, drugs and human beings, migration flows caused by a variety of
different motives, environmental disasters, and economic and financial crises. These
risks can be countered by preventive on-the-scene measures, such as
comprehensive political and economic support programmes, assistance in building
democratic structures based on the rule of law and an international military presence
on the spot.

Modern societies are particularly vulnerable in the area of information. This includes
both the military and the civilian sector and increasingly business and industry as well
(economic and technological espionage).

In view of the progressive development and availability of long-range air assets,
especially ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, Austria may face a military threat
even from regions outside Europe in a few years’ time. Moreover, the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction may lead to new threats also for Austria despite
appropriate non-proliferation regimes.

Austria, too, is confronted with the negative effects of globalisation, especially in the
shape of organised crime and international terror, but also illegal migration. Hazards
like subversive aggression against strategically important infrastructures, terrorist
attacks or threats of such attacks for blackmail purposes have become more serious
owing to the availability of new operational means (especially weapons of mass
destruction and information technologies). Such threats may originate either from
governments or non-governmental actors such as terrorist movements, organised
criminal groups, sects or even individual offenders. Characteristic of such threats is
that they mostly appear quite unexpected and without previous warning.

Natural, technological or ecological disasters as well as epidemics may also be
classified as major potential risks or dangers. They include especially accidents in
nuclear power plants, which may have long-distance effects.


-----

The Role of International Organisations and Austria’s Participation


Security and stability can be best guaranteed today through co-operation among
functionally complementary and mutually supportive institutions. These include the
United Nations and, at the European and Transatlantic level, especially the EU,
NATO with its Partnership for Peace (PfP) and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council
as well as the OSCE and the Council of Europe. Active participation in international
measures of conflict prevention and crisis management is an important element of
Austria’s security policy. This is why Austria constantly strives to improve its crisis
management capabilities in the civilian and military areas.

Austria accords central significance to the role of the United Nations in safeguarding
world peace and international security. Participation in the UN’s peacekeeping
operations has been among the key areas of Austria’s commitment in the World
Organisation ever since the Congo Mission in 1960. Since 1960, about 40,000
soldiers of the Austrian Armed Forces have taken part in UN-authorised operations.

Austria’s role in the UN’s peace missions continued to develop in the nineties. Since
then, Austria has also taken part in peace-making operations, since 1999 also with
combat units. These are UN-authorised missions conducted under the operative
direction of NATO or of a “lead nation”.

Austria plays a similar active role in the OSCE as it did in the predecessor
organisation CSCE. In the era of the Cold War, Austria was particularly committed to
promoting understanding and co-operation between East and West, given its
geographical situation. Now that the Iron Curtain has been dismantled, Austria has a
natural interest in the stabilisation of conditions in the East of the European
Continent.

The OSCE, which is based on a comprehensive co-operative security concept, at
present provides 55 states in Europe, North America and Central Asia with a forum
for co-operation on an equal footing. It renders an important contribution to stability in
Europe and thereby to Austria’s security. Austria advocates a further strengthening of
the OSCE, especially in the areas of early warning, conflict prevention, civilian crisis
management and post-conflict management.

One essential motivation for Austria’s joining the EU was that this meant belonging to
the European stability zone. From its beginnings, the European integration perceived
itself as a work of peace and thus as a security concept. Hence, the EU’s current
enlargement process may also yield benefits in terms of security policy.

Austria joined the EU without a reservation regarding its neutrality. Upon ratification
of the Austrian Accession Treaty, Article 23f was inserted in the Federal Constitution,
which states that participation in the CFSP is not restricted by the Neutrality Act in
terms of constitutional law. At the Helsinki European Council in December 1999, it
was decided that the EU should be given credible military capabilities and efficient
decision-making structures so that it can autonomously conduct crisis management
operations in the future.


-----

The dynamic development of the ESDP is wholeheartedly supported by Austria.
Austria thereby proves its determination to co-operate on an equal footing and in
solidarity in all spheres of European security and defence. Austria will make an
adequate contribution to the military and civilian capabilities of the EU. Europe’s
security primarily depends on the effective functioning of the EU and NATO.

Today, NATO constitutes not just a classical military alliance but a comprehensive
security community which is based on democratic values and which renders a crucial
contribution to peace and security worldwide through its stability-oriented policies.
Austria advocates close and trustful co-operation between the EU and NATO.

In a framework document signed in February 1995, Austria has expressed its
intention to work for the achievement of the aims underlying the Partnership for
Peace (PfP). According to the “Austrian introductory document” of May 1995, cooperation with NATO and the PfP participants comprises, in particular, joint work in
peacekeeping missions, humanitarian and disaster relief, and search and rescue
operations. From 1995 to 2001, Austria took part in the NATO-led multinational
peace operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina (IFOR/SFOR) as a PfP partner. Since the
autumn of 1999, Austria has been participating in the Kosovo operation (KFOR).

Since 1997, the framework of “enhanced PfP” has made provision for all partners to
achieve interoperability for the whole spectrum of peace support operations – i.e.,
including peace enforcement through combat missions. Thereby the spectrum of PfP
peace support operations has been aligned with that of the Petersberg Missions.

Austria is also actively involved in the work of the European Partnership Council
(EAPC), PfP’s political consultation forum. The EAPC’s purpose is to discuss a wide
variety of political and security-relevant issues. Under a tailored co-operation
programme, Austria has opened a bilateral dialogue on security policy themes with
NATO and has intensified its co-operation with NATO in the civilian and military area.

The Council of Europe, by now comprising nearly all European states as members, is
the central institution to safeguard human rights and fundamental freedoms, the rule
of law and democracy. All its member countries are obliged to conform to the
European Convention of Human Rights; the provisions of the Convention are
enforceable at the European Court of Human Rights. The Council of Europe
assumes a direct security policy function in crisis prevention and post-conflict
management.

All efforts to bring the new Eastern European member states of the Council of
Europe up to the Organisation’s high standards are strongly supported by Austria, as
they serve stability in Europe.


From neutrality to solidarity


When the Austrian National Assembly on 26 October 1955 passed the Federal
Constitutional Law on Austria’s neutrality, it was taken for granted that Austrian
neutrality would be modeled on that of Switzerland. But very soon, Austria’s neutrality
differed from that of Switzerland: as early as December 1955, Austria joined the
United Nations.


-----

In relation to the United Nations, Austria’s understanding until 1990 was that the
organisation was under an obligation to respect Austria’s permanent neutrality and
would therefore never call on Austria to take coercive measures in a military conflict
between third countries. But in the course of the Gulf War of 1991, the legal view
came to prevail in Austria that obligations under the Statute of the United Nations
take precedence over obligations under neutrality. Thereby, the Swiss model of
classical neutrality had lost its relevance.

Upon joining the European Union in 1995, Austria adopted the Union’s entire legal
and political “acquis”, which then already comprised the Maastricht Treaty and its
provisions on the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). Article J.4 of the
Treaty opened the perspective of a common defence policy which in due time could
lead to a common defence. A special provision (Article 23f) was added to the
Austrian Federal Constitution to ensure that participation in the CFSP would not be
restricted by the Neutrality Act. The Neutrality Act was thereby further limited in its
effect.

After ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty, the Austrian National Assembly in 1998
adopted another constitutional amendment, under which Austria may take part in the
whole spectrum of what is known as the Petersberg Tasks, which include combat
missions in the context of crisis management, including peace-making measures.
Such participation is possible under a EU decision.

This development demonstrates that Austria – at the latest by its unreserved
participation in the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy - has radically
changed its status of permanent neutrality in international law. Hence, on an
international comparison, Austria’s status in international law corresponds to that of a
non-allied state rather than a neutral state.

Austria is sovereign to decide on the future development of its security policy.
However, the better Austria is integrated into the international security architecture,
the more efficiently will it be able to safeguard its security interests and peace policy
objectives and to contribute to shaping a stable and peaceful environment.


**Resolution**


The Federal Government is requested to shape Austria’s security policy especially in
accordance with the following principles:


**General Recommendations**


Austria’s comprehensive security policy should be shaped in accordance with the
following general principles:

1. The people of Austria should be informed comprehensively and continuously

about the security situation in Austria and abroad. This is a vital prerequisite for
developing and sustaining a broad awareness of the necessities in matters of
security.


-----

2. A National Security Council should advise the Federal Government and the

individual Federal Ministers on all fundamental matters of foreign, security and
defence policy. To support the National Security Council, a Secretariat, conjointly
with liaison persons in the relevant Ministries, should evaluate and advise on
these matters and prepare the Council’s sessions.

3. European co-operation already initiated in the field of intelligence sharing should

be intensified. At the same time, effective parliamentary control should be
ensured to protect the citizens’ privacy and their democratic achievements and
rights.

4. Development of the existing Comprehensive National Defence programme into a

system of Comprehensive Security Provision by focusing on the new risks and
threats and by amending the legal provisions.

5. Disaster relief in the international framework is of traditional historical importance

for Austria. Austria has been an internationally respected pioneer in this field and
should further develop this role. In order to improve interoperability between
national and international relief and operative organisations, an integrated and coordinated training programme should be created, building on existing civilian and
military training facilities.

6. The range of research on security policy should be expanded in order to obtain a

comprehensive picture of security and defence matters. For this purpose, close
co-operation and networking between relevant organisations and institutions in
Austria and abroad should especially be sought.

7. In order to gain and communicate comprehensive security policy expertise, a

strategic leadership course for decision-makers in politics, business,

administration and the military should be introduced on a postgraduate level.

8. Austria should make use of opportunities for regional security policy co-operation

with neighbouring countries and other interested states.


9. The availability of vital resources (such as food, energy and raw materials) and

the protection of strategic infrastructures (such as communications and transport)
should be ensured.


**Foreign Policy Aspects of Security Policy**


Austria’s foreign and security policy should be shaped in accordance with the
following principles:

1. Consistently advocacy of worldwide respect for human rights and international

law.

2. Active participation in international efforts towards arms control and disarmament,

especially to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.


3. Appropriate contribution to international efforts towards ensuring peace, conflict

prevention, crisis management and post-conflict management.


-----

4. Continuation of Austria’s traditional engagement in multilateral institutions such as

the UN, UN affiliated organisations, OSCE, NATO-PfP/EAPC and Council of
Europe.

5. Support for Third World countries in their efforts towards economic, social,

democratic and ecological development.

6. Improvement in international environmental protection (Rio Process etc.).

7. Working effectively for Austria’s interests at the bilateral and multilateral level as

well within the framework of the EU.


8. Support of EU reforms, especially with a view to developing the CFSP/ESDP and

safeguarding the Union’s security policy interests.

9. Continuous coordination with our EU partners as the best way to promote

Austrian national interests within the EU. Development of a partnership with
likeminded states holding similar views which are linked by common regional
interests (Regional Partnership Concept).

10. Fostering bilateral relations as a vital task of Austria’s foreign policy, especially

with a view to promoting Austria’s economic interests.


11. Active participation in the ESDP in the spirit of solidarity; since ESDP is currently
pursuing the aim of giving the EU the necessary means and capabilities as well
as efficient decision-making structures for civil and military crisis management.
Austria will make an appropriate contribution in terms of quantity as well as quality
to the headline goal and capability goals of the EU.

12. Priority support to any future efforts to realize the possibility of a common

European defence envisaged in Article 17 of the EU Treaty.

13. Consistent further development of Austria’s relations with NATO within the
framework of the tailored co-operation programme. Full usage of the possibilities
for co-operation and dialogue offered within the framework of the Partnership for
Peace program. Close co-operation between the EU and NATO in the spirit of a
strategic partnership is regarded as a prerequisite for the success of the ESDP.

14. NATO’s enlargement process is welcomed as a contribution to the strengthening
of security and stability in Europe and is thereby also in Austria’s interest. In light
of the development within the field of security policy, Austria will continuously
assess the value of NATO membership for its security and defence policy and the
option of joining NATO will be kept open. Accession to NATO would only take
place after prior consent of the Austrian people (referendum).


-----

**Defence Policy**


Austria’s defence policy should be shaped in accordance with the following
principles:

1. Safeguarding Austria`s military defence capability as required by the concrete

strategic situation. A conventional military attack on Austria threatening the
country’s existence is currently not foreseeable, whereas the capability of
countering punctual attacks must be constantly maintained. This includes steps to
maintain and develop all military core functions at a high technological level on a
scale of forces operatively sustainable. This potential should ensure the growth
capability of the country’s armed forces, in case the security situation changes in
the future. Ensuring constant air surveillance and air control as required, and
defending against sub-conventional attacks and possible conventional threats.

2. Developing and maintaining the capability to participate in a common defence

efforts in adequate strength, i.e., in today’s perspective on a scale equivalent to a
division.

3. Enabling the Austrian Armed Forces to take part in the entire spectrum of the

Petersberg Tasks within a multinational framework up to the scale of a brigade or
brigade equivalent.

4. Ensuring a maximum of protection for the health and lives of soldiers.

5. Achieving interoperability to carry out peace support operations abroad and for

the defence of Austria.

6. Present conditions require coverage of the entire spectrum of military tasks; in

terms of personnel this can only be achieved by maintaining universal
conscription. However, the qualifications needed call for a gradual increase in the
degree of professionalisation and in the share of volunteers.

7. Ensuring capacities for assistance operations to help in case of disasters, support

the Federal Ministry of Interior in case of terrorist threats, to control the country’s
borders and to guard sensitive infrastructure.

8. The objectives set for the country’s armed forces and their achievements should

be subject to continuous review.


9. Promoting armament co-operation, especially within the framework of the WEAG,

should enable Austria to achieve synergies, make armament procurement less
costly and get access to latest key technologies.

10. In order to be able to fulfill the predetermined national and international tasks, the
Austrian Armed Forces should receive the necessary budgetary, personnel and
infrastructure resources.

11. The Federal Ministry of Defence should publish a White Paper every two years

with a ten-year perspective, detailing the tasks, state and requirements of the
Austrian Armed Forces, considering the prevailing situation.


-----

12. The Federal Ministry of Defence should seek opportunities for regional co

operation projects with a view to achieving synergies in various areas (e.g.
CENCOOP, joint armament projects etc.).

13. Opportunities for co-operation within the framework of PfP should be fully

exploited, and in addition to exercises and training, they should also embrace all
aspects of research, especially in the field of security policy.


**Internal Security**


Austria’s internal security policy should be shaped in accordance with following
principles:

1. Performing tasks in relation to internal security in conformity with the principles of

freedom, democracy, respect for human rights, and fundamental freedoms as
well as the rule of law, taking into account the statutory division of powers and
responsibilities.

2. Maintaining and increasing internal security which serves to guarantee continued

functioning of public services, as well as the security of the individual.


3. Fight against international terrorism, especially by intensifying internal co

operation at national level as well as co-operation at bilateral and multilateral
level and within the EU; enhancing collection of intelligence at national level and
exchange of information with partner countries.

4. Combating organised crime in all its varieties (people trafficking and smuggling,

arms and drugs trafficking, money laundering etc.) within Austria on the one
hand, and through international co-operation on the other hand, especially with
Central and Eastern European governments, and with Russia.

5. Enhancing international co-operation with special emphasis on prevention of

people smuggling, traffic in human beings and illegal migration.

6. Supply of human resources and technical equipment to combat crime and

terrorism and to protect the national borders.


7. Ensuring effective protection of the Austrian part of the EU’s external border and

strengthening co-operation with neighbouring countries.

8. Enhancing exchange of information on migration at EU level, and in particular

also with the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.


9. Active contribution to strengthening the EU’s non-military capabilities for conflict

prevention and crisis management, and join international activities serving this
purpose.

10. Assigning the necessary security forces (police, gendarmerie) for international

civilian crisis management, as far as feasible in terms of financial resources,
especially budgetary appropriations, including required training and setting of


-----

framework conditions for their deployment, as well as providing basic and
advanced training for local police forces from crisis regions.

11. Preparing, training, and, if necessary, sending on assignment civilian specialists

(administration officials, judges, public prosecutors, etc.) within the framework of
international civilian crisis management to help establish the rule of law and
democratic conditions.

12. Ensuring co-operation between federal and provincial civil defence authorities as

well as with the local operational units on the basis of existing legal provisions
(Governmental Disaster Protection Management).

13. Intensifying and optimising training and exchange of information at national and

international level, especially to prevent and fight terrorism, international
organised crime and illegal migration on the one hand, and with a view to
comprehensive disaster protection on the other hand.

14. Improving public information on self-protection measures, and optimising warning

systems.

15. Supporting ongoing efforts in the EU to implement a common migration policy,

thereby safeguarding the special national interests of the member states and
upholding the principle of burden sharing.


**SUB-STRATEGIES**


The implementation of Austria’s security policy in the framework of the
Comprehensive Security Provision relies on systematic co-operation among various
policy areas on the basis of appropriate sub-strategies.

The National Assembly therefore requests the Federal Government to work out substrategies for all areas relevant to security policy based on the present
recommendations on security and defence policy. These sub-strategies should in
particular contain those measures necessary to implement the recommendations.

The sub-strategies should be continuously reviewed, coordinated and, if necessary,
adjusted in accordance with the international framework conditions.

The sub-strategies should in particular relate to the areas of foreign policy, defence
policy and internal security. In addition, similar sub-strategies should be worked out
for the areas of economic, agricultural, transport, infrastructural and financial policy
as well as educational and information policy.
