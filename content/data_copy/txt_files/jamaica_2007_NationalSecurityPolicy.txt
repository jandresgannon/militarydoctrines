### Executive Summary

1. Security is a public good to be delivered by the State through its agents and
institutions. The vision of the Government of Jamaica for national security is to establish
a safe and secure environment in which it can focus on achieving a prosperous,
democratic, peaceful, just and dynamic society which upholds the fulfillment of human
rights, dignity for all, and build continual social progress based on shared values and
principles of partnership. In essence, the **vision is for all Jamaicans to enjoy a better**
quality of life and realise their full potential.

2. National security issues greatly affect the nation’s chances of achieving its social
and economic goals, including ensuring human security for its people. These issues also
have local, regional and international dimensions. Jamaica competes in a global
economy that demands that our goods and services be internationally competitive. Open
trading practices must be embraced and the smooth transit of goods and movement of
persons facilitated through our ports.

3. The trading systems are at risk from illicit movement and proliferation of small
arms and light weapons. The trafficking of arms and ammunition is also known to be an
integral element of the illegal drug trade. This is of particular concern, because it has a
direct bearing on the level of violence and crimes involving assault and, a parallel system
of enforcement based upon the use of unlawful force has developed to protect the
lucrative gains from these illegal activities. Not only has the level of violent crime
increased over time, but the pattern has also changed and a higher degree of organisation
and coordination has emerged.

4. Over the decades, the police-community relationship has broken down and an
unhealthy mutual distrust prevails, with the frequent cry of “we want justice” coming
from citizens. The increased frequency of mob killings is indicative of the worrying lack
of trust or confidence in our justice system and respect for the law.

5. The country is also grappling with an extremely high homicide rate. These
homicides are concentrated in known areas, but the phenomenon of murderous conflicts
is robbing Jamaica of thousands of citizens in their prime. The continuous growth in the
number of violent incidents causes many Jamaicans at home to live in fear, and
influences those in the Diaspora to abandon their dream of resettling on the ‘rock’.  It is
now conceded that Jamaica has spawned a culture of violence in its most negative form,
which is abhorrent to its values and stands in the way of every kind of social progress.
These developments and the breakdown of social mores have led to a widespread
disrespect for the Rule of Law and the value of human life.

6. Essentially, threats to Jamaica include those relating to crime, terrorism, military
and paramilitary concerns, disasters and unsustainable loss of natural resources, and
socio-economic issues. Following a careful analysis of the many threats to national


-----

security and their associated vulnerabilities, it was determined that there are 15 key
capabilities that are required to counter or mitigate the country’s exposure to these
threats. These are the capacity to:

- Control entry and exit through ports of entry and coastline/land of Jamaica

- Monitor, regulate and control use of Jamaica’s airspace, coastal waters and
exclusive economic zone (EEZ)

- Ensure an effective justice system

- Prevent crime (including armed groups and insurgents)

- Counter corruption to ensure public ownership of and confidence in the justice
system

- Regulate and control arms

- Dismantle organised criminal networks

- Gather, assess and use effective intelligence (major cross-cutting priority)

- Plan to limit vulnerability and respond effectively to disasters and unsustainable
degradation of resources

- Maintain a stable and healthy economy

- Address social and economic causal factors of alienation and crime

- Implement public education programmes (important overall cross-cutting issue)

- Ensure adequate healthcare and education

- Influence regional and international policies and activities (important crosscutting priority)

- Deter, counter or defeat ‘traditional military threats’

7. Many initiatives have been developed to deal with the scourge of crime and
violence with varying degrees of success; but there is now full recognition that national
security encompasses much more than concerns about crime and violence, as critical as
these are.

8. National security may be described as the measures taken by a State to ensure the
survival, security and protection of its interests. In the Jamaican context, national
security takes on a broader meaning beyond military defence from external threats. It


-----

encompasses civil defence measures, including emergency preparedness, and the
maintenance of law and order internally, through the police and other arms of the justice
system. The security of individuals and communities is of similarly high priority.

9. The current challenging security environment locally, coupled with the threat of
international terrorism, results in a blurring of traditional agency boundaries with many
entities now recognising that they have a role to play in promoting national security.
Hence, there is a need to enhance coordination and cooperation among the different
ministries and national security agencies.

**10.** **The National Security Policy (NSP) cohesively integrates the country’s major**
**security policies, goals, responsibilities and actions into an overall master strategy**
**for the fulfillment of the vision for national security for Jamaica. The NSP outlines**
the combined use of the political, economic, social, informational and security
instruments of national power and influence, including the military. It clarifies the
institutional framework within which the armed forces and civil institutions of the State
will coordinate their activities to create an integrated and cohesive national security
network to safeguard national interests. It also prescribes the complementary roles and
responsibilities of the public and private sectors, as well as civil society, in supporting
national security.

11. All Jamaicans must play a part in safeguarding the country’s national security.
Certainly, the JDF and JCF have critical roles to play that are central to the effective
implementation of the NSP. Notwithstanding, all Government ministries, departments
and agencies (MDAs) need to critically examine their directives and conduct their own
internal assessment of the implications of their roles and structures.

12. Individual citizens, the private sector and members of civil society groups are
invited to join in this process of transformation and take the necessary steps to contribute
to the achievement of the national security goals.

13. The NSP approaches this bold process of transformation in a three-fold way, as it
requires the transformation first of attitudes, then processes and systems and finally
practices.

14. The NSP aims to TRANSFORM ATTITUDES to promote security awareness and
zero tolerance. National security is everyone’s business! National security must have
first priority and promote a culture of zero tolerance for disorderly, violent, corrupt and
criminal conduct.

15. The NSP aims to TRANSFORM PROCESSES to achieve unity of effort. Existing
mechanisms need to be developed and strengthened to encourage cooperation and
collaboration for multi-agency security efforts locally and with international partners.


-----

16. The NSP aims to TRANSFORM PRACTICES for greater effectiveness and
efficiency. Capacity needs to be built and strengthened in all areas of need and the
sustained provision of appropriate and affordable resources ensured.

17. The NSP has identified eight Strategic Security Goals to effectively address the
challenges currently facing the nation. The goals are to:

a. Reduce violent crime and dismantle organised criminal networks

b. Strengthen the justice system and promote respect for the rule of law

c. Protect Jamaica from terrorism

d. Protect and control Jamaica’s territory

e. Strengthen the integrity of the institutions of democratic government

f. Increase Jamaica’s contribution to regional and international security initiatives

g. Provide the environment for a stable economy and an effective delivery of social
services

h. Protect Jamaica’s natural resources and reduce the risks of disasters

Matters relating to the effective analysis and use of intelligence and the enhancement of
public education and awareness are also identified as important cross-cutting issues.

18. An Action Plan has been developed to enhance Jamaica’s capacity to achieve
each of the Strategic Security Goals. The Plan outlines the specific capabilities,
objectives and actions required by named Ministries, Departments and Agencies which
contribute significantly to security within given timeframes. As a priority, there are five
Special Security Initiatives, which are areas of the NSP, which particularly require
concerted, coordinated and immediate action. They underpin the thrust of the NSP in
establishing the notion that national security is everyone’s business. These are:

a. Strengthening of the country’s national intelligence system

b. Conducting strategic reviews of critical national security bodies and accelerating
modernisation efforts

c. Establishing a national task force to strengthen the overall effectiveness of
Jamaica’s justice system and to review and strengthen Jamaican laws and the lawmaking processes

d. Enhancing programmes to promote community safety and security


-----

e. Promoting a National Strategic Communications Programme to enhance public
information and awareness, solidarity, engagement and support relating to the
implementation of the NSP and promotion of national and human security.

19. The National Security Council (NSC) chaired by the Prime Minister will be
responsible for the implementation of the NSP. The NSC will report to Cabinet, and
Cabinet to Parliament, for public accountability.

20. A National Security Strategy Implementation Unit (NSSIU) will undertake the
day-to-day coordination and drive the transformation process on behalf of the NSC and
Cabinet. However, these Government mechanisms alone, will not lead to the
transformation in Jamaica that citizens desire.

21. Funding priorities are mentioned, but the development of detailed securityrelated budgets remains the responsibility of the implementing bodies as they incorporate
security projects into their annual corporate plans, and ensure that they are implemented
through the performance management system.

22. Stronger partnerships must be developed between citizens, the private sector, civil
society and all Government organisations involved in delivering security services. Every
member of the public has a key role to play in helping to make Jamaica a safer and more
secure place to live, visit and enjoy. This requires greater public involvement and support
of law enforcement and justice activities and increased police accountability toward a
relationship that is more directly responsive to the citizens.

23. The underlying message of the NSP is that national security is everyone’s
business; and everyone must get involved.

#   A VISION FOR NATIONAL SECURITY FOR JAMAICA

### Jamaica aims to establish a safe and secure environment in which it can focus on achieving a prosperous, democratic, peaceful, just and dynamic society which upholds the fulfillment of human rights, dignity for all persons, and builds continual social progress based on shared values and principles of partnership. It aims to provide an environment in which Jamaicans can experience freedom and the other benefits guaranteed by the Constitution.

## CHAPTER ONE: – STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS

- Introduction

- Setting the context

- The impact of international geo-politics

- The global economy

- Transnational & organised crime

- Domestic political maturity and human, social and economic development

- Global environmental hazards and disasters

- Summary of Jamaica’s security concerns

### Introduction

1.1 In keeping with its vision for national security, Jamaica aims to establish a safe
and secure environment in which the country can focus on achieving a prosperous,
democratic, peaceful, just and dynamic society that will uphold the fulfillment of human
rights, dignity for all, and build continual social progress based on shared values and
principles of partnership.

1.2 National security embraces all of the measures taken by a State to ensure survival,
security and protection of its interests. Sometimes national security is considered to be
synonymous with defence from external threats, but in the Jamaican context, national
security includes the maintenance of armed forces, the provision of human security, civil
defence measures and emergency preparedness, creation of resilience in national
infrastructure, maintenance of intelligence services to detect and deter threats, protection
of sensitive information, and maintenance of law and order.

1.3 In the Jamaican context, enhancing human and community security is a vital
element in national security policies and actions. It is a priority to prevent and reduce
insecurity from crime and violence, and to enable all citizens to live in an environment in
which they are free from fear and want.

1.4 The National Security Policy (NSP) seeks to integrate the country’s major
security policies, goals, responsibilities and actions into a cohesive whole, “to provide an
environment in which Jamaicans experience freedom and the other benefits guaranteed
by the Constitution.” The aim is for all Jamaicans to realise their full potential and enjoy
a better quality of life. This NSP is an overall master plan for the fulfillment of the vision
for Jamaica through the combined use of political, economic, social, informational and
security instruments of national power. It clarifies the institutional framework within
which the armed forces, law enforcement and civil institutions of the State will
coordinate their activities to create an integrated and cohesive national security network
to safeguard Jamaica’s national interests, as well as to prescribe the complementary roles
and responsibilities of citizens and civic groups in supporting national security.
Government ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) identified as having a part to


-----

play in Jamaica’s national security will embrace this NSP, critically examine its
directives and conduct their own internal assessment of its implications on their roles and
structures. Likewise, individual citizens and members of civil society groups must
examine themselves and everyone concerned must take the necessary actions to
contribute to the achievement of the national security goals. The methodology used, and
stakeholders involved in its development, are shown in Annex A.

### Setting the context

1.5 Having attained political independence, the task of succeeding generations was to
‘secure economic independence’ as perceived by the Right Excellent Norman Manley.
The changes in the new global economy have caused that vision to be adjusted to reflect
economic inter-dependence. National achievements over the four decades of
independence are to be consolidated and appropriate measures instituted to protect them.

1.6 Policies intended to defend and protect the national interest, Jamaican values, and
what is noble in the Jamaican way of life have to be formulated within the context of the
reality of both internal and external environments. This strategic environmental analysis
must take into account not only the state of human, social and economic development in
the country, but also the impact of international geo-politics, the global economy, transnational organized crime, and global environmental hazards.

1.7 The purpose of this analysis is to synthesize those things that need to be protected
from the vagaries of the environment. It will confirm what ought to be held up as
strategic security goals and identify the sources of the principal threats. In subsequent
chapters, detailed examination of the threats and gaps in the capacity of the State to
neutralize them will unearth the areas in which the State may be considered vulnerable.
The reality of resource constraints demands optimization in task organisation, resource
allocation and coordination. The NSP articulates how Government intends to employ the
instruments at its disposal to fulfill what is its most important role of protecting and
ensuring the safety of its citizens, and also how Jamaica will continue to meet its
obligations of being a responsible member of the international community. Jamaicans at
home and in the Diaspora desire a homeland which is characterised by the rule of law,
where the sanctity of life is treasured and residents and visitors are able to enjoy the fruits
of their legitimate endeavours without undue exposure to hostile foreign interests, human
greed, and mal-administration by the State and unmitigated environmental hazards.

**_Jamaica places high value on:_**

     - A peaceful and mutually respectful society where individuals are safe and
able to exercise their rights and freedoms responsibly;

     - A strong, diverse and stable domestic economy;

      - The democratic ideal in its system of governance;


-----

     - Harmonious international relations; and

     - Its natural resources, physical beauty and the cultural heritage that is
distinctively and authentic Jamaican.

### The impact of international geo-politics

1.8 Jamaica is faced with the reality of being a small, developing island State,
positioned on the ‘third border’ of the world’s most powerful nation and largest economy.
Once a centre of world trade, Jamaica with its excellent seaports and hub for air traffic,
retains strategic importance for trans-Atlantic trade, and is a vital link between South and
North America. Jamaica has maintained a significant influence relative to its size, in
international discourses on issues such as the International Economic Order, the Law of
the Sea, the struggle against racism, and poverty. Jamaican culture and varied artistic
forms, its language, sporting prowess, and cuisine have established the Jamaican Brand
internationally. Within CARICOM, Jamaica has often been called on to offer leadership
in negotiations on behalf of the group and in the arena of combined peace-keeping
operations involving the armed forces of member States.

#### Implications for National Security

     - Jamaica is in a position to capitalise on areas of mutual security interests
shared with our traditional partners, CARICOM, Canada, United Kingdom
and the United States of America, and with our new partners in the wider
Americas.

     - It is in the national interest to maintain a strong lobby on security, antiterrorism and defence matters with decision makers in Washington,
Ottawa and London, and in other areas of mutual security interests.

     - The country’s air and seaports are strategic national assets which must be
kept operating at all costs. Redundant capabilities therefore have to be
provided to sustain passenger and cargo flows. The use of these facilities
for the transit of contraband and the movement of terrorists must be
denied.

     - Jamaica should be prepared to continue to provide leadership within
CARICOM on defence and peace-keeping initiatives and security
cooperation.

### The global economy

1.9 Jamaica competes within a global economy, which demands that our goods and
services are internationally competitive. Jamaica must also embrace open trading
practices and facilitate the smooth transit of goods and persons through its ports. The
demand for primary products has been steadily declining, and so too, the value of low


-----

skill and unskilled labour. While there has been significant tightening of immigration
policies by our neighbours, attractive opportunities for the professional and highly skilled
segments of the labour force, have grown. This has contributed to a ‘brain drain’ with
adverse effects on the nation’s health, and educational sectors, as well as managerial
competency. Major conflicts in oil-producing countries have influenced significant
upward movement in the price of oil from which Jamaica has not escaped despite
favourable agreements with our main suppliers.

1.10 The impact of regional economic arrangements, such as the Caribbean Single
Market and Economy (CSME) that permits the freer movement of CARICOM nationals
will introduce new challenges.

#### Implications for National Security

     - Jamaica’s alliances with its primary suppliers of oil, capital goods and
basic commodities such as food, are of strategic importance and should be
broadened and protected.

     - The integrity of our exports must be protected from contamination by
contraband.

     - Jamaica may seek to take advantage of the international demand for
competent security personnel, or teams, for United Nations peace-keeping
and other duties by having available trained personnel who are a part of
the regular security apparatus.

     - The country’s border control concerns will be impacted by the need to
balance security with freer movement.

### Transnational & organised crime

1.11 The growth in free trade and the dynamics of information technology have made
it easier for organised criminal networks to extend their reach across borders.
Communication links for the movement of commodities and financial networks of
international commerce also facilitate the movement of contraband and money
laundering. Drug syndicates involved in the transnational trade between drug producers
from South America and drug-consuming countries of North America and Europe, seek
out intermediaries and facilitators where security systems for their detection and
prosecution are weak or corruptible.

#### Implications for National Security

      - Jamaica must be transformed into a hard target for drug syndicates in both
its practical capabilities and its image, by establishing appropriate counter

-----

measures and by developing the means to prevent penetration by
transnational criminal networks, and the perpetration by Jamaican
nationals with links to criminal networks abroad.

     - Jamaica must become the most difficult zone for the transit of narcotics
and the proceeds of crime.

### Domestic political maturity and human, social and economic development

1.12 There has been some convergence on the part of the major political parties, but
the legacy of the period of sharp ideological differences still lingers among party
loyalists. Enclaves of dominant one-party loyalty remain, although internal cohesion has
weakened significantly, leading to fragmented communities with informal power centres
that are in frequent conflict and are not accountable to traditional authority.

1.13 Social progress has been retarded in many poor urban communities that are
characterised by squalor, high levels of poverty, unemployment, illiteracy, corner crews,
dominant gangs, easily accessible firearms and ammunition, fatherless children, and the
inconsistent delivery of public services. Over the decades, the police-community
relationship has broken down and an unhealthy mutual distrust prevails, with the
frequent cry of “we want justice” from residents. The unstable and often violent
environment in these communities has been hostile to formal commercial activity, and
the more progressive young people with the potential to offer constructive leadership tend
to relocate at the earliest opportunity.

1.14 Notwithstanding the concentration in some known pockets, the phenomenon of
murderous conflicts is robbing Jamaica of thousands of citizens in their prime. The
continuous growth in incidents of violence causes the majority of Jamaicans at home to
live in fear, and many of those of the Diaspora to abandon the dream of resettling on the
‘rock’. It is now conceded that Jamaica has spawned a culture of violence in its most
negative form, which is contrary to our values and stands in the way of every kind of
social progress.

#### Implication for National Security

     - It is vital to the survival of Jamaica that the phenomenon of murderous
conflicts is stopped and that communities are liberated from the
dominance of violent, armed gangs.

### Global environmental hazards and disasters 

1.15 The effects of global warming and other phenomena that could lead to rising sea
levels do not escape the island of Jamaica.  The Caribbean is one of the few regions with
active volcanoes and although tsunamis may be rare, the region is not immune to them.
Climate change could significantly affect rainfall patterns impacting agricultural


-----

production and food security.  Hurricanes have been impacting the region with increased
regularity and intensity and even when spared direct hits, Jamaica can occasionally
expect severe effects from these systems.

1.16 A satisfactory solution for nuclear waste disposal in this region is still being
sought. In the meantime, shipments of nuclear wastes may transit the region, and without
the capacity to detect this; Jamaica could become exposed to potential threats associated
with the transportation of these hazardous substances.

#### Implications for National Security

     - The scientific community in Jamaica must be challenged to keep the State
informed as to the real and potential dangers as they develop and also to
propose appropriate mitigating measures.

     - Jamaica must remain engaged with international organisations with an
interest and capacity to track the movement of hazardous materials.

     - Zoning regulations have to be publicised and enforced to protect the
population from the effects of natural and man- made disasters.

### Summary of Jamaica’s security concerns

1.17 In the context of the current strategic environment, national security concerns are
centred on several themes, which will lead to the identification of Strategic Security
Goals (SSGs). The themes are summarised below:

     - How does the State stop murderous conflicts, protect its key assets and
reassure the populace?

     - How does the State prevent transnational criminal syndicates and terrorists
from using its land, air and sea space to facilitate their activities?

     - How does the State eliminate from the social and business environments,
the extraneous factors that negatively impact quality of life and normal
market forces?

      - How should Jamaica’s exposure to disasters be mitigated, and its natural
resources better protected?

      - How much more should Jamaica capitalise on mutual security interests
with international partners and continue to offer within the region,
leadership on defence, security and peace-keeping matters?


-----

      - How best should the State organise, equip and utilise its security apparatus
for greater effectiveness?

A detailed examination of the more significant threats existing in the environment is
presented in the next chapter.

## CHAPTER TWO: – THREATS TO JAMAICA’S NATIONAL SECURITY

**•** **Crime**

**•** **Terrorism**

**•** **Military and Paramilitary**

**•** **Disasters & unsustainable loss of natural resources**

**•** **Socio-economic threats**

**•** **Key capabilities**

2.1 Threats to national security greatly affect Jamaica’s chances of achieving its
social and economic goals. These threats have local, regional and INTERNATIONAL
implications.

2.2 Of critical importance is the country’s vulnerability to these threats. The lack of
structured and coordinated intelligence by the various law enforcement arms of the State
leaves an unacceptable gap in the defence of law and order, which is exploited by those
who do not share in the national interest.

### Threats relating to crime

**_The Rule of Law is at risk of collapsing_**

2.3 The level of crime has increased over the years and consequently the pattern of
criminal activities reflects a greater degree of organisation and coordination. The
situation has worsened by what appears to be an increased tolerance of crime and
criminals within the wider society.

2.4 It should be noted that many define social status by the amount of wealth that one
possesses. However, very little thought is given to the source of wealth. To gain wealth
and social status by any means has propelled persons into illegal activities, which are
usually financially rewarding.

2.5 In order to protect the gains from these illegal activities, an accompanying system
of enforcement has developed whereby extreme force is used to protect turf, routes and
profits as well as to ensure loyalty.

2.6 These developments and the breakdown of social norms have led to a widespread
disrespect for the Rule of Law and the value of human life. The extremely high homicide
rate, which the country is experiencing, has to be viewed in this context.

2.7 A generally violent environment along with a justice system, which works slowly,
causes two things: (a) the perception that justice cannot be guaranteed by the State and
(b) that the only solution for even relatively minor matters, is death.


-----

2.8 The high level of violence encourages more violence. The slow working of the
justice system leads to a lack of confidence in it, and the perception that some persons are
above the law, further weakens the respect for law. The increased frequency of mob
killings is an indication of a growing lack of trust and respect for the law, and lack of
confidence in the justice system.

#### Threats Relating To Crime

     - The Rule of law is at risk

      - High Levels of Violence, Particularly Armed Crime and Homicide

     - Organised Crime

     - Illicit Trafficking in Narcotics

     - Illicit Flow of Arms and Ammunition

     - Gangs and Gang Activities/Warfare

     - The Effects of Violence on Communities

     - Extortion

     - Kidnapping

     - The condition of Remand Facilities and Correctional Centres

     - Community Orders

     - Endemic Corruption

     - White- Collar Crime

     - Human Trafficking

     - Cyber Crimes

2.9 Abusive behaviour and the use of excessive force by members of the police and
the military have not aided the efforts at building respect for law and order. These
actions have contributed to a growing sense of alienation among some persons in the
society who feel they are being denied justice. The sense of alienation manifests itself
through illegal roadblocks as well as open displays of disrespect and distrust in the
constituted authority. As a result, parallel systems of ‘justice’ have evolved with the
assent of the “dons” and informal “area leaders”, as well as vigilante justice and arbitrary
community enforcement.

2.10 The justice system is perceived as being oppressive especially to the less affluent
and this perception is perpetuated when the delivery of justice is slow.

2.11 Regarding the Witness Protection Programme, no participant has ever been lost
but there still remains a lack of confidence in the programme as witnesses, albeit outside
of the programme, have been intimidated and have met untimely deaths.

2.12 What is required is an ethos of sustained investigation that will lead to the
successful prosecution of criminals. It is this outcome that will better engender respect
for the Rule of Law.


-----

2.13 To prevent the collapse of the Rule of Law, Jamaica needs sufficient capacity to
monitor, regulate, investigate, prosecute and penalise criminal activities, with special
focus on the area of financial crime, particularly money laundering.

**_High Levels of Violence, Particularly Armed Crime and Homicide_**

2.14 The Report of the National Committee on Crime and Violence acknowledges that
there are no fewer than ten classifications of personal crimes that are continually in the
news and to which a significant number of Jamaicans would consider themselves
vulnerable.[1] These are property crimes and crimes against the person which include
murder, sexual assault, aggravated assault and robbery. The statistics on violent deaths
between 1970 and 2005 have revealed a grim picture; more than 22,300 cases of
homicide have been recorded. This high incidence of homicide and violence is
attributable primarily to political tribalism, domestic violence, drug/gang related
conflicts, reprisals and mob killings and breakdown in the social order.

#### Techniques of Organised Crime

**•** **Learns quickly from its defeats, and is competitive**

**•** **Moves assets quickly and is skilled at exploiting the laundering opportunities**
**of the global financial and property markets**

**•** **Aided by technology and the speed of communication**

**•** **Have simple, if any, rules; ruthlessness and success can easily go together. It**
**threatens or uses violence**

**•** **Corrupts law enforcement, governments and depletes a weak State’s**
**resources.**

**_Organised crime_**

2.15 In a globalised environment organised crime syndicates are characterised as
‘stateless, decentralised networks that move freely, quickly and stealthily across borders,
and are powerfully motivated by either religious and political goals or enormous greed
and financial gains, to commit acts that threaten global security’.[2]

2.16 The Caribbean manifestations of criminal networks, at present, are motivated by
greed and financial gains. The trafficking of illegal drugs, small arms and people has
netted enormous profits for a minority at substantial costs to the majority in the
Caribbean. Jamaican officials have acknowledged that the drug trade nurtures the
violence and lawlessness pervading the society.  Left unchecked, the very survival of the

State will be at risk. Where organised crime succeeds, the State will ultimately fail; “…as
drug cartels, street gangs and warlords move from hierarchical to ‘internetted’
international criminal actors, they pose an increasingly insidious threat to the legitimacy
and even solvency to the State as they are refining their ability to co-opt, corrupt and
challenge State institutions”.[3]

**_Illicit trafficking in narcotics_**

2.17 The illicit drug trade in Jamaica is part of a wider international network. The
geographic location of Jamaica makes the island attractive to international traffickers
who have made this one of the key cocaine-trafficking routes for South American
narcotics en route to North America and Europe. The use of maritime vessels provides
the primary mode for smuggling large quantities of cocaine through the region. While
“go-fast boats” are common conveyances for the traffickers, bulk cargo freighters and
containerised cargo ships are vulnerable to exploitation by drug smugglers. Additionally,
traffickers also employ the use of single and twin-engine aircraft to operate from
clandestine and unprotected airstrips or to drop cocaine on land or sea for collection by
vehicles and vessels. Couriers also provide another mode of smuggling smaller quantities
via commercial flights leaving the region for Europe and North America.

2.18 Efforts to protect the island and its citizens from the drug trade should include
strategies to reduce the level of demand. The need for a comprehensive and integrated
strategy that deals with both supply and demand is critical in light of the strategy of South
American cocaine traffickers to increasingly pay Caribbean drug traffickers in kind,
leading to increased distribution and consumption of cocaine in the region. The evidence
from seizures indicates that traffickers are seeking to establish a Caribbean transit route
for synthetic drugs into North America. The possibility exists that the traffickers may also
use these drugs to pay local smugglers and thus increase their distribution and
consumption in the region.

**_Illicit flow of arms and ammunition_**

2.19 The illicit movement and proliferation of small arms and light weapons (SALW)
are of particular concern and have a direct bearing on the levels of violence and crimes
involving assault. The trafficking of arms and ammunition is an integral element of the
illegal drug trade. The availability of large numbers of arms and ammunition poses a
direct threat to national security by the mere fact that there are so many of these weapons
in the hands of unauthorised persons.

2.20 The sources of illicit arms range from illegal trafficking and smuggling, purchase
or rental of these arms locally to theft from licensed and unlicensed firearm holders, and
to a lesser extent local manufacturing (home-made). The process of issuing firearm
licences is corrupt, with the result that persons of questionable character have received
legal firearms.

Insurgencies.” Summer 2002, 40-53


-----

2.21 As an island State, Jamaica needs to ensure that its borders are not porous.
Although manpower and equipment have an impact on the capacity to secure the borders,
effective vigilance by State agents entrusted with border security at authorised air and
seaports can have a significant effect. There should also be sufficient monitoring of nonauthorised entry points. Adequate intelligence regarding trafficking, purchases and
rentals of firearms as well as adequate security of firearms by licensed holders will help
to eliminate Jamaica’s vulnerability to this threat.

2.22 There is also concern about the adequacy with which private security firms are
monitored especially as it relates to the potential misuse of arms and ammunition held by
them. This misuse could occur either because of criminal intent, simple negligence or the
arming of persons who are not sufficiently trained to handle firearms.

**_Gangs and gang activities/warfare_**

2.23 A 1998 study[4] of Jamaican gangs states that it is a myth that gangs and “dons”
serve a positive social function in their communities. The value system of these groups
constitutes a sub-culture of violence, which is often used as a rite of passage. ‘Making a
duppy’ (killing an individual) is used as a means of initiation and to achieve status. The
researchers of this study viewed the emergence of “area leaders” as resulting from the
failure of the community and politicians to provide basic necessities. The financial
resources of gangs come primarily from extortion, drug smuggling and remittances from
overseas-based members and supporters.

2.24 The threat presented by gangs could be minimised if the country significantly
reduced the political and social tolerance of criminal “dons”; the facilitation of garrison
politics and the coercive control of communities with a power base rooted in large
financial resources. Political and social tolerance of gangs/dons/garrison political
communities could eventually lead to a failed state.

**_The Effects of violence on communities_**

2.25 The World Health Organization (WHO) Report on Violence and Health, has
defined violence as “the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual,
against oneself, another person, or against a group or community that either results in or
has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, mal-development
or deprivation.”[5] The rapid increase in homicides and other acts of violence poses serious
security threats and health risks to Jamaica and its citizens. The WHO experts have
stated that violence is a major public health issue. The impact of violence on individuals,
communities and the society should therefore not be underestimated.

2.26 Domestic violence is one of the more pervasive and common forms of violence
plaguing the society. It contributes to the overall pattern of crime and violence due to its

4 Gang Study: The Jamaican Crime Scene, Ministry of National Security, 1998
5 The WHO World Report on Violence & Health, 2002


-----

debilitating effects on the social fabric and its role in socialising youth to violence as a
means of dispute resolution. Women and children are disproportionately at risk from
domestic violence.

2.27 Failure to protect the groups that are most vulnerable increases the risk that these
groups will remain in or enter long-term poverty, which will help to fuel the cycle of
violence and abuse.

2.28 The organisation and administration of the justice system is a critical factor in the
effective management of crime and violence. This has to be supported by an
understanding of crime and violence as not being purely a law enforcement problem, but
reflected also as problems in education, family, and other spheres. These structures, if
dysfunctional, incubate deviance and delinquency, and thus crime and violence. It is
important to treat the causes and not only the effects of crime and violence.

**_Extortion_**

2.29 The crime of extortion manifests itself primarily as part of the protection racket
where criminals demand payment from business people for providing protection from
criminal victimisation. There has been growing evidence within the construction and
general business sectors, particularly in urban areas, that extortion has increased the cost
of security, hence the overall cost of doing business in Jamaica. This puts Jamaica at a
competitive disadvantage with its trading partners and serves as a deterrent to
investments, social and economic development. Additionally, this has caused migration
of businesses from high-risk areas, to areas less volatile and those not zoned for
commercial/ industrial use. The victims’ fear of reprisal on their businesses and low level
of confidence in the security forces’ ability to combat extortion has led to low reporting
and little or no prosecution. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this state of affairs has led
to the practice of extortion becoming so pervasive that it has now infiltrated the public
transport sector as well as the private home construction.

**_Kidnapping_**

2.30 Kidnapping is not prevalent in Jamaica but has the potential to become a major
problem especially as the incidence of kidnapping in other Caribbean territories and Latin
America is a growing problem. In recent years, there have been a few cases of
kidnapping for ransom, perpetrated mostly by gangs.

**_The condition of remand facilities and correctional centres_**

2.31 In 2003, the population in the correctional system in Jamaica was 48% above
capacity in adult institutions. The two major reception institutions (Tower Street and St.
Catherine Adult Correctional Centres) are severely overcrowded, poorly maintained and
inadequately staffed. These are 19th century buildings that are in disrepair, are very
costly to secure, and present major challenges for the treatment and care of inmates. As a


-----

result, the integrity of the security systems in these institutions can be easily
compromised.

2.32 Escape from correctional centres undermines the morale of those involved in the
justice system who have worked to remove these criminals from the streets. It also
undermines the confidence of the general population in the justice system.

**_Community Orders_**

2.33 Community Orders (non-custodial sentences) are sometimes violated and often
lead to repeat offences and the establishment of criminal associations in communities. It
is often due to lack of proper monitoring because of poor collection and verification of
pre-sentence data on offenders by officers of the court. This is a continued threat to
public safety.

**_Endemic corruption_**

2.34 Corruption in its various forms is a serious threat to the social order and the Rule
of Law. It manifests itself in many ways and inhibits the ability of the State to effectively
discharge its responsibilities and obligations. Systemic weaknesses in the organisation
and management of various functions of government, public and private sectors, have
contributed to this malaise.

2.35 Examples abound, including the illegal issuance of driving permits, motor vehicle
licences, firearm licences and the bribery of public officials. Political institutions and
freedoms can also be affected by corruption. This could occur through the corruption of
public officials which may not only be encouraged through rewards but may also be
coerced through direct threats i.e. through an offer of ‘gold or lead’. Penetration and
weakening by criminal networks of the justice system, government and the political
process could eventually lead to the demise of the State.

**_White- collar crime_**

2.36 The risk and cost to businesses from the theft of intellectual property, financial
crimes and the fraudulent use of commodity and service brands run into billions of
dollars annually. The regular apprehension of the perpetrators of white collar and
organised criminality is beyond present public law enforcement capabilities[6] and this
adds to the levels of insecurity within the society. It also results in a diversion of tax
revenues from the Government.

**_Human trafficking_**

2.37 The smuggling and trafficking of persons between countries is of increasing
concern in the Caribbean. This is another lucrative source of income for organised
criminal networks and constitutes a significant threat against children and young women.

6 Royal College of Defence Studies Lecture on Organised Crime, March 2003.


-----

In addition to smuggling across borders there is growing concern about internal
trafficking.

**_Cyber crimes_**

2.38 Networked information systems play an increasingly important role in our sociopolitical, economic and financial infrastructure, in terms of critical information services
within telecommunications, commerce and banking sectors. The recent spate of ‘hacker
attacks’ on Microsoft and other operating systems around the world have highlighted the
vulnerability of existing technology.

2.39 Attacks on networked information systems exploit vulnerabilities that arise from
flaws in the software systems, from the failure of system administrators to properly
configure such software, or from organisational policy failures that leave ‘back doors’
(such as unauthorised modems) through which intruders can gain access.

2.40 There needs to be more specific legislation to address this problem, in addition to
sufficient skills training and increased awareness of the risks associated with electronic
commerce and other Internet activities.

### Terrorism

**_Direct threats_**

2.41 It is widely acknowledged that international terrorism entails the deliberate use of
violence or threat of violence against civilians and/or property in order to cause fear and
instability in a larger population. Jamaica is not immune from the threat of terrorism, as
we exist in a global environment where the actions of non-state actors can create
instability and insecurity.

2.42 Direct threats of terrorism include hostage taking, hijacking, various narcoterrorism incidents, release of toxic chemicals and biological agents into the environment,
and the use of nuclear weapons.

2.43 The potential for terrorist incidents originating locally is real. Based on the
country’s proximity to the United States, groups with terrorist intent could seek to use
Jamaica for training and as a base from which to launch assaults. Overseas economic
interests in Jamaica, such as investment by multi-national corporations, and foreign
States’ interests, including diplomatic missions and international organisations, could
make us indirectly susceptible to terrorist activities. The presence of foreign nationals
including overseas visitors and other persons who may be the target of terrorists,
increases this vulnerability. Jamaica has limited ability to identify and monitor
individuals entering the country with terrorist intent. This difficulty is particularly acute
given that the majority of traffic, which passes through the airports, is foreign tourists
(70%) about whom the immigration services would have little information.


-----

2.44 Jamaica’s tourist industry, particularly the resort areas and cruise shipping, has
been expanding and could be regarded as a soft target for terrorist attacks aimed at
nationals of the major western powers, particularly since the events of September 11,
2001. The security of these areas poses a challenge in light of limited financial,
technological, human and other resources.

2.45 There is a need to improve Jamaica’s intelligence and monitoring systems. And
efforts should be made to better coordinate and share information locally, regionally and
internationally. More efficient controls on immigration are also necessary. Other
resources including the legal framework and technology are to be enhanced to identify
and monitor persons passing through our borders. Also of importance are specific
legislation and controls designed to prevent and counter terrorism in its various forms.

2.46 The mechanisms to detect and counter the financing of terrorist networks are to be
improved. Jamaica is to control the flow of illicit arms, explosives, and nuclear,
biological and chemical (NBC) hazards to reduce the opportunities for terrorist
operations. Other measures to be implemented include: an improved national
identification system; increased public awareness and knowledge of the potential dangers
of terrorism; as well as adequate preparedness of security agencies and key Government
institutions. A formal operational protocol and agreement should be established between
the operational arms of the security sector. The human resources and financing provided
are to be adequate. There should be sufficient specialist training in anti-terrorism
measures.

**_Indirect threats_**

2.47 Sustainable development in the areas of tourism, investments and the country’s
ability to earn foreign exchange are indirectly threatened by terrorist acts committed
overseas.

2.48 The flow of visitors to the island was severely reduced immediately after
September 11, 2001. There was a reduction in the volume of exports and foreign
exchange earnings as a result of the new security measures associated with the inspection
of Jamaican exports, particularly to North America.

2.49 If the situation exists where a terrorist organisation penetrates political
institutions, Jamaica could become a haven for terrorists and a launch pad for terrorist
activity. Depending on the extent of this infestation, Jamaica could find itself becoming
the target of international counter-terrorist activities. The country should therefore ensure
that there are sufficient controls on the sources of funding for political organisations and
political representatives.


-----

### Military and paramilitary threats

**_Illegal paramilitary groups_**

2.50 Illegal paramilitary groups may be defined as groups of civilians organised in
military fashion (armed and using organised tactics), without legitimate authority. In the
face of the real danger posed by heavily armed criminal groups in Jamaica, the potential
exists for them to evolve into a more potent and cohesive force that could pose serious
threat to security institutions and State apparatus. There is recent evidence of efforts to
form such a coalition of small gangs.

2.51 **There is evidence of a strong operational paramilitary group in the region.**
**This group with its drug- trafficking activities could expand to take in Jamaica’s**
**criminal groups, as well as other groups in the Caribbean and Latin America with**
**the threat of them attempting to create a narco-state.**

**_Insurgency_**

2.52 It is arguable that insurgents do not particularly threaten the country, if insurgency
is defined as the rebellious rise in revolt against civil authority or a government in power.
Insurgents are typically organised as armed paramilitary groups or rebellious elements
within the armed forces. They disregard constitutional authority, the democratic tradition
and the legitimacy of armed forces as the agents of State power.

2.53 This National Security Policy (NSP) recognises the probability of the rise of
insurgents if not with overt, direct political goals, then as a front for organised crime.
Vulnerability to this threat exists because of the ease with which an evolving insurgent
group could initially mask its motives under the cover of existing gangs or political
organisations. Jamaica’s strategic intelligence process will need to be strengthened to
lessen this vulnerability.

2.54 There should be adequate monitoring of private security firms. Although there is
no evidence that private security companies are likely to engage in undesirable activities,
they constitute an organised armed body. It is also possible for such an organisation,
under misguided influence, to become a threat to the constituted authority.

**_External military threats_**

2.55 One of the main arguments against a standing military or for a significantly
reduced standing military in Jamaica is that there has been no apparent external
conventional military threat to the country. In the post-Cold War period, many States
have faced greater threats to their stability and security from within, than from external
sources owing to the prevalence of intra-State conflicts. Jamaica must therefore be in a
position to respond swiftly to any such threat. The threat of intra-State conflict in the
region is real. Additionally, there are a number of countries in the region that could be
viewed as insecure due primarily to border disputes and as such Jamaica, as a member of


-----

CARICOM, the Commonwealth and the OAS, should be in a position to contribute to the
region’s security.

2.56 The important point is that Jamaica could be vulnerable to conventional military
threats because of insufficient resources and a large unprotected coastline. The present
military resources are insufficient to defend against any reasonable military effort and
this is compounded by the fact that an invading force has so many options for entering
the country. There is also a need for adequate strategic intelligence; improved capacity to
detect and provide early warning; increased ability to hold the enemy at bay until
assistance arrives; and adequately developed defence relationships (bilateral, regional,
international) to provide assurance in event of attack. Ultimately, Jamaica should be able
to cover all probable avenues of approach to the country in addition to having
arrangements in place to manage the effects of NBC hazards and other weapons of mass
destruction (WMDs).

### Disasters & unsustainable loss of natural resources

**_Natural disasters_**

2.57 Jamaica is vulnerable to natural disasters primarily because of its geography,
geomorphology, and the stage of economic development. It is threatened by hurricanes
and tropical storms. The island is also located in an earthquake zone and suffers from the
effects of seasonal climatic changes and is not immune from tsunamis.

2.58 The island was impacted by Hurricane Ivan between the 11th and 12th of
September 2004. An interim figure of J$40.4 billion has been recorded for direct and
indirect losses in addition to 17 persons having lost their lives. It was estimated that 14%
of the total population, that is, 369,685 persons, were directly affected by the hurricane.

2.59 Also of concern are gaps in enforcement of building regulations and poor physical
planning/zoning of developments. While in principle there is acceptance of the Caribbean
Unified Building Code (CUBIC), adoption has been less than robust. The local laws
regarding building standards are being flouted, due largely to lack of awareness and
inadequate enforcement. There is anecdotal evidence that the process of building
approvals has been subject to corruption, resulting in unsuitable sites being used.

**_Man-made disasters_**

2.60 Jamaica is also vulnerable to man-made disasters, which include fires, chemical
spills, biological and radioactive contamination and other major accidents. Domestic fires
are the major man-made hazards that affect the island. In 2002, an estimated J$1.4
billion was lost due to domestic fires. A majority of these fires occurred in inner-city
communities and was triggered by shared or illegal electrical wire connections and the
use of domestic oil lamps/candles.


-----

2.61 Other man-made disasters, for example, marine spills from vessels and land-based
sources can create severe environmental pollution that can negatively impact tourism,
fisheries and marine transportation. Also, severe leaking of pollutants into aquifers would
affect sustainable water supply sources. Aviation disasters can also cause severe
destruction and disruption to normal airline traffic.

**_Unsustainable exploitation & loss of natural resources_**

2.62 Through inadequate or poor enforcement of regulations both on land and within
the marine environment there is severe pressure on the natural resources both living and
non-living. There is a general lack of control over Jamaica’s marine environment. The
over-exploitation of the fisheries has resulted in stock depletion and biomass reduction.
Poaching by foreign flag vessels contribute significantly to the problem, particularly
during closed seasons. Improper fishing methods also impact the fisheries in a negative
way. Marine pollution from land-based sources at approximately 87%, and vessel sources
at 13%, continue to pose a threat to our pristine waters and beaches on which tourism
heavily depends.

2.63 Illicit sand mining is still a prevalent crime in Jamaica. The impact on river
courses and land stabilization are well documented. Other illegal mining activities also
take place with similar consequences for the land. Unplanned human settlements increase
the susceptibility to both natural and man-made hazards. Inadequate development orders
and improper monitoring of informal settlements in volatile, marginal and ecologically
sensitive areas have allowed the growth and mushrooming of vulnerable communities in
urban areas. This threatens the stability of the land and can be a danger to the safety of
persons who occupy dwellings in these marginal areas.

2.64 While Jamaica has not been a victim of the trans-boundary movement of wastes
such as garbage and other material, there is always a danger that this could occur from a
major marine incident due to a vessel casualty within our Exclusive Economic Zone.

### Socio-economic threats

**_External economic shocks_**

2.65 As with other Small Island Developing States (SIDS), Jamaica is economically
vulnerable and is subject to a number of special constraints and threats, which pose
serious challenges for the achievement of sustainable economic development. These
threats and vulnerabilities arise from exposure to adverse external shocks, which are
beyond the country’s control, as well as from structural, financial, physical, social and
other internal handicaps.

2.66 These handicaps include a high degree of openness, great dependence on strategic
imports and other scarce resources such as oil, a narrow export base, small tax base,
inadequate or inefficient infrastructure, high levels of crime and violence, and


-----

susceptibility to natural disasters. In addition, the presence of corruption erodes investor
confidence, the country’s national image and is antithetical to good governance.

**_Financial crimes, including tax evasion & fraud_**

2.67 Financial crimes constitute a serious threat to national security and to Jamaica’s
economy. These crimes, some of which involve complex transactions and international
connections, include tax evasion, tax fraud, commercial smuggling and money
laundering. If left unchecked, they will continue to undermine the integrity of the
country’s financial institutions and deprive the government of vital tax revenues, which
are required to finance myriad recurrent and capital projects and programmes for the
people of Jamaica. In the case of tax crimes, Jamaica suffers primarily from commercial
smuggling and General Consumption Tax (GCT) fraud.

2.68 The presence of tax fraudsters creates two effects: first, a reduction of investment
and employment opportunities by tax-compliant businesses and second, an incentive for
tax-compliant businesses to become tax cheats.

2.69 The State is also exploited by non-payment of taxes, fees and other public
charges, and collection efforts are strongly resisted or ignored. GCT fraud, whereby
persons collect GCT, falsify their returns and hence fail to pay what is due to the
government, is at an unacceptable level. The perception of an inequitable tax regime,
gaps in the legislative and policy framework as well as corruption and dishonesty, are
some of the factors, which have enabled such activities to take place. These actions
undermine the social order by legitimizing corruption, as well as distorting and disrupting
equitable commercial transactions. They also have the tendency to threaten the economic
viability of the State. The non-compliance with the law in this area is due to deficiencies
in legislation and the administrative machinery.

2.70 Money laundering is also of serious concern, since it affects the soundness and
stability of the financial system, distorts the economy and undermines development
efforts. It attempts to assure drugs and arms-related criminals that they can hide their
financial and other assets, which provide the fuel to operate and expand their criminal
enterprises. Due to weaknesses in the Money Laundering Act and other relevant
legislation, the detection, investigation and successful prosecution of this crime has been
difficult for the entities involved.

2.71 Drugs and arms traffickers are also targeting commercial importers and/or
exporters in an effort to avoid detection at authorised ports of entry. The contamination
of legitimate cargo has the potential to seriously disrupt the flow of Jamaica’s
international commerce.

2.72 Financial crimes are also being committed by a number of illegal/unlicensed
currency exchanges or cambios. This crime affects the exchange rate, creating instability
within the financial system, which in turn adversely affects the economy. Jamaica is
currently experiencing a relatively small threat of counterfeiting of Jamaican bank notes,


-----

which if allowed to escalate could pose a direct economic threat, with consequences for
national security.

2.73 There is a strong correlation between good governance, sustainable development,
and a competent and effectively functioning security sector. A stable and secure
environment allows the country to capitalise on global economic opportunities.

**_High crime & violence preventing increased Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)_**
**_and sustainable development_**

2.74 Criminal activities such as murder, gun crimes, extortion, arson and kidnapping,
increase security and insurance costs (relating to personal and  property protection), the
timeliness of project implementation and overall capital and operational costs. There is,
therefore, a direct link between security, the levels of efficiency achieved and the growth
and financial viability of many companies.

2.75 There is also a relationship between the prevalence of crime and violence and FDI
flows. Foreign, as well as domestic companies prefer to operate in stable and secure
environments, thus high levels of crime influence capital investment decisions.

2.76 In Jamaica, where State security is in need of further improvement, key economic
sectors such as tourism, transportation, mining and agriculture can be adversely affected
by crime and violence, which can result in a reduction in revenue inflows as well as the
flow of investment capital. The tourism sector is of particular concern. In the past,
violence and disorder in Jamaica have had a negative impact on tourism flows and
development. The high cost of countering the effects of negative perceptions and
damaging travel advisories in major foreign markets, results in a less than optimal use of
scarce resources.

**_International commodity and financial shocks_**

2.77 External shocks resulting from globalisation and the internationalisation of
financial markets can threaten Jamaica’s economy and jeopardize important strategic
interests. The country could be adversely affected by international commodity shocks
due to the high dependence on strategic imports such as energy, raw materials, capital
goods and food staples.

2.78 The country could also be affected by international financial shocks as a result of
the currency composition of assets and liabilities in the domestic financial sector. This
has the potential to create instability within the financial system and can impair
government’s macro-economic programmes. Global financial instability can be
manifested in terms of high interest rates, high inflation and unstable currency.


-----

**_Caribbean Single Market and Economy (“CSME”)_**

2.79 The introduction of the CSME, which allows freer movement of CARICOM
nationals, may also facilitate the movement of nationals with criminal intent. This raises
additional border security concerns for identifying CARICOM nationals with criminal
connections or intent.

**_Trade in contraband_**

2.80 Jamaica Customs is actively involved in the facilitation of trade, revenue
collection and border protection. Despite the Department’s efforts, contraband
trade/smuggling, which includes illegal drugs, firearms, ammunition and commodities
such as tobacco products and alcoholic beverages, remains a major problem. Any
connection between corrupt Customs officials and persons involved in organised crime,
with their significant financial resources, would also ensure that inbound and outbound
smuggling operations continue in a highly sophisticated manner and with great potential
for corruption and violence. It is therefore critical that such practices are eliminated or
drastically curbed.

**_Abuse of Jamaica’s Intellectual and Cultural Property Rights_**

2.81 Intellectual Property (IP) refers to creations of the mind: inventions (patents),
literary and artistic works, symbols, names, images and designs used in commerce. IP,
which is regarded as one of the drivers of economic growth, is divided into two
categories: Industrial Property and Copyright. Industrial Property includes inventions,
trademarks, industrial designs and geographical indications of source. Copyright covers
literary and artistic works such as plays, novels, poems, musical works (including the
rights of producers and performing artists), films, drawings, paintings, photographs,
sculptures and architectural designs. Abuse of IP rights can seriously erode potential
income and therefore impact economic growth negatively.

**_Ineffective security operations of ports_**

2.82 Under new international maritime and aviation security rules, Jamaica is required
to comply with the provisions of the international instruments or suffer the consequences
of being bypassed by trading vessels and downgraded at our international air and sea
ports. This could have severe implications for our international trade and passenger flows
and hence the level of economic activity; additionally, uncontrolled aerodromes and
makeshift airstrips abound. While our international trading ports are generally
functioning effectively with 100% compliance with the International Ship and Port
Facility Security Code, they need to be monitored to ensure continued compliance.

**_Erosion of social and moral values_**

2.83 There is an increasing erosion of social and moral values evidenced by the
disregard for the sanctity of life and authority figures. The resulting culture manifests


-----

itself in: breakdown of family life; the replacement of positive socialising agents with
negative ones; dependence on the proceeds of criminal activities; negative political
partisanship; increased levels of indiscipline; decline in social order and the lack of
respect for basic human rights. This has been reinforced by the effective use of threats,
corruption and extortion against public officials, civil society and citizens.

**_High unemployment and poverty_**

2.84 Unemployment impacts on national security considerations because of the
relationship between unemployment, poverty and crime. Crime is, to a certain degree, a
rational act in the sense that perpetrators weigh the relative returns from legal and illegal
activity and balance these against the respective costs. In a context of high and chronic
(that is, long duration) unemployment, where the probability of obtaining legitimate
opportunities for economic advancement is perceived to be low, the net payoff from
illegal activity may be compelling. This incentive is particularly strong in instances
where the likelihood of detection, apprehension and prosecution is perceived to be low.
Many communities lack resilience and are vulnerable to a slide towards domination by
criminal gangs (for example, if such gangs seek to move to avoid law-enforcement
actions in their present bases), and a descent from formal to informal economies.

2.85 A growing core of persons in Jamaica has remained poor. Although having in
place many social intervention programmes, Jamaica is still dogged by high levels of
poverty. This has been contributory to high crime levels in some communities.

**_Inadequate support for vulnerable groups_**

2.86 Vulnerable groups comprise children, the elderly, the indigent, homeless, street
people and the disabled. Of these vulnerable groups, children, including street boys, and
adult drug addicts living on the streets, also present a significant threat to public order.

2.87 Children exposed to abuse are themselves likely to offend in similar ways later in
their lives. According to the Keating Report in 2002, most children’s homes and places of
safety for vulnerable children were operating below international standards and have
contributed to the abuse of our children.

**_Abuse of Civil Rights_**

2.88 The illegal imposition of the State’s power and authority over its citizens,
including the application of physical and moral abuse constitutes a threat to good order
and governance. This malaise can lead to serious alienation of, and disrespect for not only
law enforcement agencies, but also the Government itself.

**_Disorder_**

2.89 There is a perception that the growing sense of mistrust and lack of confidence in
the ability of Government to ensure social equity and to facilitate sufficient economic


-----

opportunities, have led to the development of distorted loyalties to ‘drug dons’ who work
with Jamaican criminal groups operating mainly in the United States and the United
Kingdom.

2.90 The high incidence of homicides in Jamaica has resulted in not only the fear of
crime but also the fear of victimization. People tend to have fairly accurate perceptions of
their victimization potential based on key variables such as risk and opportunity. The
fear of crime and of victimization leads to anxiety and an almost paralysing effect on the
minds and actions of citizens.

2.91 Violent crime does not occur in isolation as an environment of low enforcement,
lack of respect for authority, and non-compliance with the applicable rules and
regulations have contributed to the breakdown of public order and civility in Jamaica.
This disorder stems from indiscipline and social discontent and also manifests itself in the
unregulated use of land, and frequent disruptive protest actions such as illegal roadblocks
and industrial disputes. These threats have had a significant negative impact on public
safety and security.

**_Entrenchment of garrison communities and informal settlements_**

2.92 Garrison communities may be defined as densely populated urban areas, which
profess a faithful allegiance to one political party, and demonstrate a total intolerance to
any objectors. They are characterized as being closed and they undermine and disregard
the legitimate authority but exercise a separate system of law and order directed by an
area leader who metes out ‘justice’ through the use and/or threat of violence. The social
arrangements within a garrison community inhibit the ability of the security forces to
function properly. The physical layout of informal settlements could restrict the ability of
the security forces to gain access, patrol and respond to emergencies.

**_Alienation of youth and other groups_**

2.93 The prevalence of idle youth, their affinity to gangs, involvement in illicit
activities and disrespect for order are evidence of the social threat existing in many
communities in Jamaica. These are manifestations of anti-social behaviour, which result
in the assault and abuse of citizens, as well as disrespect for authority. A high percentage
of youth, mainly boys, face an uncertain future because they leave school before
completing their secondary education. They also exhibit traits of low self-esteem, leading
to dependence and possibly inappropriate adult behaviour.

2.94 Of particular concern is the breakdown in social order, unregulated use of public
spaces, social discontent and reduced public safety.

**_Recidivism_**

2.95 Recidivism or the tendency to return to crime among the incarcerated population
significantly decreased over a ten-year period. However, in 2001 and 2002 recidivism


-----

stabilized at 18.7% and increased to 23.8% by the end of 2003. This early rise in the
recidivism rate presents an immediate threat to public safety as an ex-inmate’s repeat
convictions may occur within a year and rise to more than five imprisonments in a fouryear  period. The inadequacies in the rehabilitation and re-integration systems increase
the cases of repeat offences.

**_Industrial unrest_**

2.96 The industrial climate in Jamaica has been tempered over the last decade as a
result of the employment of more mature approaches to negotiations. Threats include
violent or damaging conduct of industrial disputes, breakdown in labour/management
relationships, and lack of confidence in dispute resolution mechanisms. Industrial
disputes in the gasoline trade have particular implications for national security,
oftentimes causing dislocation of traffic and severe disorder at service stations.

2.97 In addition, animated negotiations between the Constabulary and Government,
particularly over pay rates, often cause tensions, severe anxiety and also serve to
embolden criminals.

**_Unmanageable flow of refugee/asylum seekers_**

2.98 Instability in neighbouring States can pose a security threat to Jamaica’s territorial
integrity if there is an outflow of persons due to political unrest or severe economic
problems. The recent problems in Haiti need not be overstated, however, Jamaica’s
vulnerability will not disappear and therefore this threat must not be treated lightly. The
resources required to receive, process and accommodate refugees are enormous.
Currently, Jamaica does not have a structured procedure for processing refugees, and
there is no permanently designated, and suitably equipped, facility for accommodating
refugees. In recognising the problem, we must be mindful of international treaty
obligations regarding the proper treatment of refugees, including asylum seekers.

**_HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases_**

2.99 HIV/AIDS is a global concern. The Caribbean, with an HIV infection rate of 2.0
per cent, is the global sub-region with the second highest HIV prevalence rate, surpassed
only by Sub-Saharan Africa. The HIV/AIDS pandemic poses a serious threat to the
productive sector as the majority of AIDS cases occur among the productive and
reproductive age groups -20-29 years and 30-39 years.

**_Substance abuse_**

2.100 Substance abuse has become a grave social problem as well as an important cause
of morbidity and health expenditure in Jamaica. Survey results estimated that in 2001,
12% of the population aged 12 to 55 years was abusing or dependent on alcohol and/or
drugs. Illicit substances include marijuana, cocaine, crack, heroin and ecstasy. This
pattern of drug use is consistent with previous findings in which people in their late teens


-----

and early twenties often experiment with drugs, but withdraw from it in later years.
Marijuana users represented 99% of all users of illicit substances. Lifetime use was 19%
(or approximately 1 in 5 persons) and current usage was estimated at 10%. Of particular
concern are the trends among the youth in Jamaica to experiment with drugs and the
likelihood of persons being exposed to gateway drugs at an early age.[7]

**_The effects of the education system on security_**

2.101 The education system is failing. The main contributory factors are the inability of
some to meet the cost of education, the negative attitude of parents and children, and the
inadequacies that exist. The current functional literacy rate at the end of the primary
level is 70 %, which is not considered satisfactory as the Government aims for ‘full
literacy’. Young persons who should otherwise be in schools or training institutions
commit a number of criminal acts. One of the issues posed by early school leavers is
their exploitation by ‘career’ criminals who recruit them for various crimes including
drug smuggling and the movement of firearms.

### Key capabilities 

2.102 From the above analysis of the threats to national security, the capacity to
mitigate the extent of Jamaica’s vulnerability was identified and outlined in the Strategic
Security Goals (see Chapter 3).

2.103 Jamaica will need to create the capacity to:

     - Control entry and exit through ports of entry and coastline/land of
Jamaica.

     - Monitor, regulate and control the use of Jamaica’s airspace, coastal waters
and EEZ

     - Ensure an effective justice system

     - Prevent crime (including armed groups and insurgents)

     - Counter corruption to ensure public ownership and confidence in the
justice system

     - Regulate and control arms

     - Dismantle organised criminal networks

     - Gather, assess and use effective Intelligence (Major cross-cutting priority)

-----

- Limit vulnerability and respond effectively to disasters and unsustainable
degradation of resources

- Maintain a stable and healthy economy

- Address social and economic causal factors of alienation and crime

- Develop messages for a Public Education campaign (important overall
cross-cutting issue)

- Ensure adequate Health Care and Education

- Influence Regional and International Policies and Activities (Important
cross-cutting priority)

- Deter, counter or defeat ‘Traditional Military Threats’

- Strengthen resilience of communities at risk from criminal dominance.

## CHAPTER THREE: – THE STRATEGY

**•** **The Approach**

**•** **Strategic Security Goals**

**•** **Cross-cutting issues**

**•** **Special Security Initiatives**

**•** **Action Plan for Strategic Security Goals**

3.1 The environmental and threat analyses serve to gauge the scope of Jamaica’s
national security malaise, to which the main contributors are the multi-faceted problems
of: crime, violence and disorder, disregard for the rule of law, border issues and risks of
terrorism.

3.2 Key required capabilities that will lessen the vulnerabilities and counter the
threats to national and human security would therefore form the core of the Jamaica
National Security Policy (NSP).

3.3 Following the underscored general **Approach** is a specific list of **Strategic**
**Security Goals (SSG) and an illustration of key Cross-cutting issues.**

3.4 Each SSG is broken down into specific **capability, objectives and** **actions,**
including the lead and supporting organisations responsible for their timely
implementation.

3.5 The NSP also identifies five areas which particularly require concerted,
coordinated and immediate action, and which lay the ground for maximizing the outputs
from other NSP actions. These have been labelled Special Security Initiatives (SSI’s).

### The Approach

3.6 The general approach presents the security framework that seeks to steer the NSP
implementers in a common direction. This aims to ensure a well-coordinated package of
effective national security measures.

3.7 The dominant theme of transformation requires new ways of thinking, acting,
searching for and applying more efficient processes and technologies. The approach is
divided into three parts:

     - **TRANSFORMING ATTITUDES to promote security awareness and**
**zero tolerance.** Development of information programmes to encourage
all stakeholders to see national security as everyone’s business; to put
national and human security first and to promote a culture of zero
tolerance for violent, disorderly, unsafe, corrupt and criminal conduct.

     - **TRANSFORMING PROCESSES to achieve unity and coherence of**
**effort. This is to be achieved through the development of mechanisms to**


-----

encourage cooperation and collaboration for multi-agency security efforts
locally and with international partners.

     - **TRANSFORMING PRACTICES for greater effectiveness and**
**efficiency. Accomplished through capacity building in all areas of need,**
including the sustained provision of appropriate and affordable resources.

### Strategic Security Goals for Jamaica

3.8 The recurring security-related themes emerging from the Strategic Environmental
Analysis and Threat Analysis have led to the identification of eight Strategic Security
Goals (SSGs).

**Jamaica’s Strategic Security Goals**

**•** **Goal 1 – To Reduce Violent Crime and Dismantle Organized Criminal**
**Networks**

**•** **Goal 2 – To Strengthen the Justice System and Promote Respect for Rule**
**of Law**

**•** **Goal 3 –To Protect Jamaica from Terrorism**

**•** **Goal 4 – To Protect and Control Jamaica’s Territory**

**•** **Goal 5 – To Strengthen the Integrity of Institutions of Democratic**
**Government**

**•** **Goal 6 – To Increase Jamaica’s Contribution to Regional and**
**International Security**

**•** **Goal 7 – To Provide the Environment for a Stable Economy and an**
**Effective Delivery of Social Services**

**•** **Goal 8 – To Protect Jamaica’s Natural Resources and Reduce the Risks**
**of Disasters**

### Cross-cutting issues

3.9 Two main cross-cutting issues are common to several SSGs. These are: the need
for effective intelligence, which is a vital tool for focused security operations, and wellcoordinated public affairs programmes aimed at increasing public awareness, education
and consultation on security issues and fostering partnership between government and
society.


-----

**_Effective analysis and use of intelligence_**

3.10 The ability to address several of the SSGs depends on current and reliable
strategic and tactical intelligence. There is room for improvement in the collection,
analysis and dissemination of actionable intelligence throughout the security architecture
of Jamaica. This includes better use of existing data collected by non-intelligence entities.

#### Capabilities required for effective intelligence gathering, analysis and use

     - Effective collection, analyses and use of tactical intelligence for
operations, policy development and direction.

     - Mechanisms to allow local effective national inter-agency cooperation and
information sharing.

     - Mechanisms to allow for effective mutual cooperation with regional and
international intelligence and enforcement bodies.

     - Ability to identify and monitor criminal deportees, suspect persons, highrisk visitors and goods transiting Jamaica, and persons with terrorist intent.

     - Ability to monitor Jamaica’s borders in order to control movement of
people and potentially dangerous materials.

     - Ability to monitor and regulate financial flows, particularly cross border
activities.

     - Ability to monitor possible insurgents and prevent insurgency.

     - Mechanisms to allow for use of existing data collected by non-intelligence
entities (with appropriate safeguards against misuse).

#### Objectives to enhance intelligence systems across Jamaica’s security sector

     - Establish a national intelligence body primarily to collect and analyse
information for strategic purposes distinct from existing sectoral security
entities in the military, police, Customs and FID.

     - Enhance inter-agency coordination in intelligence matters at the tactical,
operational and strategic levels. This coordination must enable MDAs to
systematically share and receive relevant information.


-----

     - Improve cooperation regionally and internationally between relevant
agencies in matters of mutual interest by strengthening agreements and
protocols.

**_Public education and awareness_**

3.11. There is a need to strengthen support for the State agencies and programmes that
enhance national and human security. To do this, for example, public awareness on the
impact of national security on sustainable development should be stimulated and
maximized.

#### Capabilities required for coordinating public education and awareness

     - Programmes to improve the awareness of the general public on the
operations of the justice system and outcomes of judicial proceedings

     - Programmes to educate and consult the public on national and human
security issues and priorities

     - Programmes to draw on societal support for the prevention of terrorism

     - Programmes to build public confidence in, and respect for, constitutional
authority

     - Programmes to garner public support for sustainable use of natural
resources

     - Programmes to deal with social issues, which include values and attitudes,
poverty alleviation, health threats (HIV/AIDS in particular) and substance
abuse

     - Programmes to enhance public awareness of non-violent dispute
resolution methods

     - Programmes to mobilise and draw on societal support for safer
communities.

#### Objective to enhance public education and awareness of national security

3.12 The public sector is to develop and implement more comprehensive public
awareness and education programmes relevant to its national security responsibilities in
order to inform, garner support and build public confidence in and partnership with the


-----

national security system, and to strengthen international partnerships by exerting some
international influence.

### Special Security Initiatives

3.13 The main purpose of the Special Security Initiatives, numbered 1 to 5 and
outlined below is to focus attention on a small number of areas where concerted and
coordinating national actions need to be made in the short term. To this end, the efforts of
the public sector must be coupled with effective and consultative engagement of the
private sector and other civil society stakeholders.

**3.13.1** **_Strengthening of Jamaica’s National Intelligence System_**

3.13.1.1 In order to strengthen the intelligence apparatus of Jamaica, a National
Intelligence Consultative Group (NICG) will be established by the National Security
Council and the MNS. This Group will aim to develop terms of reference, functional
responsibilities, cooperative mechanisms (local and overseas), coordinating functions,
reporting responsibilities and oversight arrangements for Jamaica’s intelligence system.

**a.** **Establish a National Intelligence capacity to provide strategic**
**intelligence**

The Government of Jamaica (GOJ) requires strategic intelligence to
inform its decision-making on strategic or policy issues that go beyond
supporting tactical operations. For this purpose, **a National Strategic**
**Intelligence Agency (NSIA) will be established. This body will not**
replace any existing intelligence organisation, instead it will fill a major
gap in existing national capabilities.

**Special Security Initiatives**

**1.** **Strengthening of Jamaica’s National Intelligence System**

**2.** **Conducting Strategic Reviews of Critical National Security Bodies and Accelerating**
**Modernisation Efforts**

**3.** **Establishing a National Task Force to Strengthen the Overall Effectiveness of**
**Jamaica’s Justice System and to Review and Strengthen Jamaica’s Laws and Law-**
**Making Processes**

**4.** **Enhancing Programmes to Promote Community Safety and Security**

**5.** **Promoting** **a National Strategic Communications Programme to facilitate public**
**information and awareness, solidarity, engagement and support** **relating to the**
**implementation of the NSP and promotion of national and human security**


-----

This NSIA will be an independent civilian State agency mandated to
gather information, process such information into strategic intelligence,
and provide the GOJ with timely advice on matters of strategic
importance. Also covered within its mandate will be the establishment of
bilateral and other intelligence agreements. This is to ensure that there is
adequate information/intelligence sharing with international partners. The
Director of the NSIA will be a reputable member of civil society, and its
structure will allow for appropriate parliamentary oversight.

This new body will not have control over the existing operational
intelligence arms of the Government, though it must necessarily link
closely with them, performing some coordinating roles. Necessary
protocols will be developed to ensure effective exchange of information
and assessments with operational intelligence bodies, including those of
the JDF, JCF, Jamaica Customs, FID, Immigration Citizenship and
Passport Division, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade. The
NSIA will be accountable to the NSC and could initially be located at the
MNS but in the long term should be in the Cabinet Office.

**b.** **Improve capacity and coordination of existing National Intelligence**
**bodies**

Measures are needed to enhance the capacities of the existing intelligence
bodies so that they provide reliable and useful intelligence in their spheres
of responsibility and strongly contribute to the overall effectiveness of
Jamaica’s national intelligence system. This requires additional and
strengthened programmes and mechanisms that will enhance information
exchange and co-ordination amongst the existing intelligence bodies to
ensure effective co-ordination with the new NSIA.

The role of the National Security Advisor, who currently functions within
the MNS, should at this time include:

     - Overseeing the proposed National Strategic Intelligence Agency
and coordinating the existing intelligence bodies.

     - Monitoring, from the strategic level, overall security threats and
concerns.

     - Providing advice to the NSC and the Minister of National Security.

     - Providing intelligence briefs for the Ministers of Finance, Foreign
Affairs, and other Ministers as necessary.


-----

**c.** **Extend and develop information-sharing systems for National**
**Intelligence**

A key objective of the NSP is to ensure that Jamaica’s Government and
society contribute appropriately to achieving its security goals. Numerous
government or public bodies that are not part of the national intelligence
system collect or hold information that is useful and relevant to national
strategic or operational intelligence needs. Systems need to be established
to enable and ensure that such information is available for use by
Jamaica’s intelligence system, subject to appropriate constraints and
safeguards. Protocols for such information sharing will be developed and
customised to each department or agency concerned, and mechanisms and
capabilities will be established to ensure appropriate information
provision. Similarly, measures will be taken to ensure and develop
appropriate arrangements for information sharing by private bodies, such
as financial institutions or private security companies.

**3.13.2  Conducting strategic reviews of critical national security bodies and**
**_accelerating modernisation efforts_**

3.13.2.1 Every relevant MDA will conduct reviews of its policies, programmes and
capabilities to ensure that they contribute appropriately to the implementation and further
development of the NSP. The JDF and JCF each play a critical role, in meeting the SSGs.
To ensure they are adequately positioned to implement the NSP, they are to conduct and
complete detailed and thorough strategic reviews. The scope and focus of these reviews
will be customized according to the context and responsibilities of each organisation.
GOJ will provide specific guidance on the mandate, scope and priorities for such reviews
in due course, in accordance with the following guidelines:

**a.** **Strategic Review of JCF**

The JCF is central to the effective implementation of most of the key goals
of the NSP. The JCF, which has been undergoing substantial development
and reform based on its Corporate Strategies, has been the focus of several
studies such as the Wolfe Report and the National Consultative Committee
on Crime and Violence.

These Reports recommended fundamental changes to the style and manner
of policing in Jamaica. To date, in spite of the JCF’s efforts through its
Corporate Strategies, these far- reaching changes have yet to occur. It is
therefore necessary for the JCF, in the near future, to go beyond its
Corporate Strategies and have a systematic and structured strategic review
in order to provide the modern framework and institutional mechanisms
for the transformation of the JCF into a well balanced, respected and
capable police service.


-----

It is recognised that one of the fundamental problems to be addressed is
the leadership and management capacity of the JCF, particularly as it
relates to selection, recruitment, orientation, preparation, training,
promotion and advancement of gazetted officers. These subjects have not
been adequately addressed in previous reviews.

In addition to the issues highlighted above, the JCF Strategic Review
would examine legislative and higher level administrative structures, such
as the Police Services Commission (PSC) and Police Public Complaints
Authority (PPCA), in order to facilitate an effective civilian oversight
mechanism for accountability of its performance and conduct.

Such a Strategic Review requires that Government through the MNS
establish an independent body to oversee the process. This review process
should consult the JCF, agencies, experts and stakeholders from other
relevant branches of Government, as well as a wide cross section of civil
society. The aim is to:

     - Determine the vision that the people of Jamaica have for policing.

     - Recommend changes to the JCF Act and its regulations.

     - Determine appropriate oversight mechanisms to ensure effective
democratic, legal and financial accountability.

**b.** **Strategic Defence Review of JDF**

A detailed and thorough Strategic Defence Review (SDR) will be
conducted immediately, to ensure that the requisite defence policies,
capabilities and roles are in place to meet relevant goals and requirements
in the NSP. This SDR will seek to: establish the roles and functions
(inclusive of jurisdiction and primary/supporting roles) of the JDF in
cooperation with other security bodies; identify the policies and
capabilities required; and detail how existing gaps or inadequacies in
capabilities will be addressed, and how effective coordination will be
achieved with other relevant Jamaican departments and agencies and
regional and international partners.

This review should be conducted within the framework of goals, priorities,
capabilities and responsibilities set out elsewhere in the NSP, including
the division of roles and responsibilities between the JDF and JCF.

The JDF will play a leading role in the preparation of the technical
elements of this SDR, under the **Minister of National Security,** the
**Defence Board** and Cabinet. However, the Review should also involve
experts and stakeholders beyond the JDF, to help to ensure coordinated
and effective use of appropriate resources across Government departments


-----

and agencies. It should also consult with experts and stakeholders from
civil society and regional or international partners.

**c.** **Functional reviews of security-related responsibilities of MDAs**

In order to achieve the **SSGs, a series of functional reviews are to be**
carried out among **MDAs, such as** **Customs, Immigration, FID** and
others. Such reviews will aim to reorient the organisations in relation to
their role in the overall NSP. They will further establish and clarify the
organisations’ roles and functions (inclusive of jurisdiction and
primary/supporting roles), the capabilities required, identify the existing
capability gaps and articulate how such gaps may be filled. The
organisations should include suitable external parties in its review. Subject
to normal security vetting, the inclusion of independent parties will add to
the transparency of the process and give credibility to the results.
Functional reviews must include:

          - Determining their direct national security responsibilities within
the NSP

          - Confirming, and seeking where necessary, the resources to ensure
that they possess the required capabilities

          - Reviewing their structure as necessary

          - Ensuring that their other policies and programmes do not conflict
with the SSGs

          - Establishing their own coordinating mechanisms which link to the
National Security Council, and enhancing internal, external and
public information exchange.

**3.13.3** **_Establishing a National Task Force to strengthen the overall effectiveness of_**
**_Jamaica’s Justice System and to review and strengthen Jamaica’s Laws and_**
**_Law-making processes_**

3.13.3.1 An effective justice system is essential in order to achieve the NSP
Strategic Security Goals. It is important to enhance the performance and role of each
institution within the justice system, including the JCF, prosecution services, courts,
judiciary, and correctional services. It is equally important to ensure that each of the
elements work effectively together.

3.13.3.2 The review of existing laws and systems and capabilities for the drafting
of new legislation are of critical importance to achieving the SSGs. In order to ensure the


-----

timely and expeditious review of current laws, the ambit of the Legal Reform Department
needs to be reviewed and any deficiencies addressed.

3.13.3.3 A Law Commission will be established to ensure that the laws of Jamaica
are relevant and current, meeting both domestic and international requirements, customs
and practices. Furthermore, this Commission will examine the adequacy of existing laws,
including the provision for realistic fines, fees and punishments consistent with modern
imperatives, global trends and international conventions. Their strict mandate would be
the continuous proactive amendment and creation of legislation to ensure the continued
viability of the justice system.

3.13.3.4 In order to achieve the strategic aims to improve and strengthen Jamaica’s
justice system, a temporary justice system Review Task Force will be established by the
Cabinet Office, MOJ and MNS to review and oversee the necessary changes. This Task
Force will:

     - Review the legal framework, systems, support services (some multidisciplinary), human resources, infrastructure and equipment of the entire
justice system and make recommendations to effect the necessary changes

     - Oversee the implementation of the new measures

     - Accelerate current modernisation measures

     - Oversee the creation of the Law Commission and its initial output

**3.13.4.  Enhancing programmes to promote community safety and security**

3.13.4.1 There are currently several initiatives that support community safety and
security which include the involvement of citizens in those communities and state
agencies responsible for delivering social services, the JCF community policing drive,
NGOs, schools and sports development groups, the church and other significant
community- based organisations.

3.13.4.2 The concern is the need to coordinate and bolster these social
interventions in order to provide sustainable and effective services to communities, thus
countering any dependency on alternative, illicit governing structures. Coordinated
multi-agency programmes, in partnership with concerned communities, will be
maintained and further developed with the following objectives:

a) Promote community safety and security, including measures to ensure safe
and secure access to health, education and other public services;

b) Enhance the resilience of vulnerable communities to increase their
capacity to resist efforts to subject them to illicit or coercive governance
arrangements;


-----

c) Transform garrison communities, including dismantling the illicit and
coercive networks;

d) Strengthen and enforce compliance with planning regulations and
regularise or dismantle informal settlements.

**3.13.5.  Promote a National Strategic Communication Programme**

3.13.5.1 Successful implementation of the NSP requires the full support of all
citizens and civil society. There needs to be a radical change in the way in which
everyone views his or her responsibilities for national and community safety and security.
There needs to be recognition that “Security is everybody’s business,” and not the sole
responsibility of the police and other law enforcement agencies. A communication
programme should seek to change the nature of group relationships in the society. It
must offer opportunities to build trust and new partnerships among Government and it
agencies, the citizens and civil society. An effective communication strategy should also
counter negative images and promote positive aspects of Jamaica both locally and
internationally to assist in attracting investment and visitors to the island. Therefore, a
comprehensive National Strategic Communications Programme needs to be
developed and sustained.

3.13.5.2 This Programme is less about public information and public relations and
more about seeking to have a more transparent and responsive relationship between the
Government, the people and civil society. Through the oversight of the **Minister of**
**Information, state machinery such as the Ministries through their Public Information**
**Officers in collaboration with the Jamaica Information Service (JIS) and other media**
houses (print, radio and television) are envisioned to be the vehicles of delivery.

### Action plan for Strategic Security Goals

3.14 Each Strategic Security Goal will be examined to identify the capabilities required
to counter the threats to Jamaica and its citizens. Broad objectives are set to fill the gaps
where these capabilities either do not exist or are inadequate, and specific actions are
identified, with milestones against which progress can be measured. Responsibilities are
assigned to the relevant MDAs with timelines. Short Term is within two years, Medium
Term two- five years, and Long Term is beyond five years. These are not intended to be
exhaustive, nor prescriptive; as it is recognised that effective implementation of the NSP
will require each MDA to review in detail its own roles, responsibilities and actions.
MDAs must also ensure that their other policies and programmes are not in conflict with
the SSGs, but contribute to achieving the key goals of the Policy.


-----

### Goal 1 - To Reduce Violent Crime and Dismantle Organised Criminal Networks

3.15 There is an absolute need to prevent and reduce violent crime and disorder in
Jamaica and to eliminate organised criminal networks, which include countering the
proliferation of narco-trafficking, illegal arms, kidnapping and extortion. The major
concern relating to the high levels of violence in Jamaica stems from the existence of
organised criminal gangs fuelled by the illegal trade in narcotics and arms. These
criminal activities, which in some cases exploit existing political divides, threaten the
viability of the State and have had a substantial negative impact on public safety and
security.

#### Specific Capabilities, Objectives and Actions

 Capability 1

3.15.1 A highly effective Police Force that is properly structured, manned with well
selected, suitably trained and properly equipped personnel who are held accountable for
performance and conduct at every level, and managed by high quality leadership with
effective oversight and safeguards against potential disruptive industrial actions.

**Objective**

**•** **Transform JCF and fully implement Community Policing, Review,**
**adequately finance and expedite police reform and modernisation**
**plans.**

**Specific Actions - Short Term**

a. **MNS and JCF will conduct a strategic review of the JCF within six – 12**
months and expedite the provision of a credible civilian oversight
mechanism. Its roles must go beyond the appointment of senior personnel
and must include accountability measures, setting and monitoring
operational standards, performance and conduct.

b. **MNS and JCF will develop and implement a public education programme**
to inform citizens of their roles in community policing, and to garner their
support.

c. **OPM, MNS and JCF will within six - 12 months develop a coordinating**
mechanism to ensure greater accountability for the relevant social
agencies responsible for shelter, community services and economic


-----

empowerment/job creation, in order to support the community policing
effort.

#### Capability 2

3.15.2  A well coordinated, efficient and effective intelligence system, with adequate
resources and strategic oversight.

**Objective**

**•** **Improve the quality of the criminal intelligence product that will**
**prove a tipping point for the dismantling of organised criminal gangs.**

**Specific Actions - Short Term**

**a.** **MNS will take the lead in establishing a communication system among**
intelligence agencies, including the development of an intelligence
database with all MDAs, with necessary MOUs.

b. **MNS** will enhance collaboration amongst all agencies to ensure
appropriate intelligence focus is directed at organised crime, including the
transnational drug trade and violent criminal gangs. This collaboration is
to include regional and international security agencies. The **MNS**
supported by **MFAFT is to provide for substantial linkages with the**
evolving CARICOM security initiatives endorsed by the Heads of
Government in July 2005, such as the Coordinating Information
Management Authority (CIMA).

#### Capability 3

3.15.3 A capacity to stimulate and promote social renewal, responsible citizenship and
peaceful co-existence in communities that demonstrates their readiness for development.

**Objective**

     - **To** **transform** **garrison** **communities** **through** **a** **coordinated**
**programme of security forces action and appropriate social**
**development initiatives.**

**Specific Actions - Short Term**

a. **Parliament, MNS and MOJ will pilot reforms to force the severance of**
unwholesome ties between politicians and criminals or community leaders
of questionable character within the short term. To further support this,


-----

the JCF will continue to aggressively investigate and prosecute suspected
“dons” for financial and other crimes.

b. **The Development Division (Cabinet Office) will coordinate the**
development of multi-agency/sectoral programmes to improve the
delivery of social services and provision of amenities in garrison
communities. This will include the channelling of community power
through legitimate and transparent structures and institutions to break the
dependency syndrome and the attraction of criminal lifestyle, particularly
among youth in the inner city communities. Intensify existing resocialisation programmes to restore good values and attitudes especially
among young people, in the long term. Take steps to reduce
unemployment in the affected communities. This will be done in
collaboration with MNS and other State actors, and in partnership with the
business sector, NGOs and other civil society groups including the church.
The coordination mechanisms will be established within six to 12 months
followed by the ongoing implementation of these programmes.

c. The **JCF, with the support of** **MNS and legitimate community groups,**
including churches, will encourage the establishment of proactive
Neighbourhood Watch groups in order to increase collaboration between
the JCF, community groups and private sector corporations, particularly as
it relates to enhancing its public image.

d. Through the collection and analysis of reliable intelligence, the **JCF,**
supported by the **JDF, will aggressively seek to** dismantle the illicit and
coercive networks, and to eliminate the proliferation of illegal guns and
ammunition in these communities.

e. Development, updating and strict enforcement of zoning, safety (e.g. fire)
and building codes by the MLGE, MAL, and MHTWW.  This will be
done within the short term, and consideration will be given to the
inclusion of appropriate consultation by both the **JDF and** **JCF in these**
development orders. This would ensure, for example, that housing
schemes are constructed in a manner that would allow for safe patrolling
by the security forces in terms of non-restrictive road layouts, or building
configurations that do not allow for the concealment of snipers.

f. **MHTWW will continue to expand existing relocation programmes in**
order to regularise or dismantle informal settlements. Persons being
relocated should share in the cost of the housing solutions on a
concessionary basis and this will be done in the short term. MLGE is to
ensure that abandoned structures are demolished quickly within the ambit
of the law, in the interest of community safety.

g. **MOEY to lead re-socialisation programmes particularly aimed at youth.**


-----

h. **MOJ** to enhance dispute resolution mechanisms to help resolve social
conflicts and promote conflict resolution so that restorative justice
complements retributive justice.

#### Capability 4

3.15.4  Improved and sustained systems or mechanisms to detect and eliminate
corruption at all levels of law enforcement and the CJS with independent civilian
oversight, appropriate resources and staffing. Concerning corruption in the broader
government structure and society, there needs to be strengthened policies and practices,
including sanctions, to promote transparency in government and society such as in the
awarding of contracts, where processes may be unduly influenced, and in revenue
collection within fee- based agencies.

**Objective**

**•** **To bolster and more rigorously implement anti-corruption measures.**

**Specific Action - Short Term**

A review of the **Office of the Contractor General (OCG) and the** **National**
**Contracts Commission (NCC) will be conducted within six months in order to**
improve their efficiency, enhance the requisite guidelines for the procurement of
contracts and launch an awareness programme to highlight the correct procedures
involved in awarding contracts.

#### Capability 5

3.15.5  Strengthened and effective regulatory systems and border control measures to
control the possession, use, and trade of small arms, light weapons and ammunition.

**Objective**

**•** **To improve regulation of firearms and explosives and strengthen**
**border control measures.**

**Specific Actions - Short Term**

a. **MNS will introduce the necessary legislation for the improved regulation**
of firearms licensing and the establishment of a **National Firearm**
**Licensing Authority with primarily civilian oversight and administration.**


-----

b. **MNS will within six months review and enhance existing regulations for**
the importation, storage and use of explosives to ensure full compliance,
and also rigorous and effective systems for controlling and licensing
imports, exports and transit of firearms, associated ammunition, parts and
components, and explosives.

c. **Customs** to ensure that items entering our ports, including parcels and
mail, are properly inspected.

#### Capability 6

3.15.6  Effective regulation and monitoring of private security companies to ensure
full accountability and to guarantee that their operations appropriately complement and
support the law enforcement agencies. For example, the regulating authority must
conduct regular audits and spot checks of companies to ensure their compliance on arms
and ammunition security, staff vetting and training, and it must have an appropriate
investigative capacity.

**Objective**

**•** **Effectively regulate and monitor private security companies.**

**Specific Actions - Short Term**

a. **MNS to determine within six months whether the powers and resources of**
the PSRA are adequate to effectively deal with the dynamic factors
impacting security within six months.

b. **MNS to review the protocols that exist between the JCF and the private**
security industry to ensure opportunities for cooperation are appropriately
exploited.

#### Capability 7

3.15.7 Public education programmes to promote community safety and encourage
**public order in communities and urban centres as well as to encourage respect for**
constitutional authority. These programmes must bolster sustained political and public
support of efforts to dismantle organised criminal networks, and remove the tolerance for
criminal ‘dons.’ This includes garnering the support of the business and local
communities against organised criminal networks and the strengthening of citizens’
awareness of their rights and responsibilities.


-----

**Objective**

**•** **To promote public awareness and education programmes to reduce**
**criminal activities and promote community safety.**

**Specific Actions - Short Term**

a. **MNS** will take the lead, assisted by **MID, MOJ** and relevant NGOs, to
formulate public education programmes within six to 12 months. Within
the short term, the MOEY, supported by the Cabinet Office will ensure
that schools include courses geared towards alerting students  about the
impact of crime and violence on society (included in civics), highlighting
alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and promoting social
intervention programmes. There is a need to first review existing
programmes within four to six months and to implement and monitor new
programmes as long as necessary.

b. **MOEY** and MLGE will further develop programmes to encourage
respect for authority and public order in communities.

c. **MNS supported by** **MOJ** and MOEY will alert citizens about the
damaging effects of criminal activities, and where permitted under law,
expose criminals and their actions.

d. **MOH will work in cooperation with** **MNS and** **MOJ to analyse injuries**
from violence with a view to identify ‘hot spots’ and improve planning or
response strategies.

#### Capability 8

3.15.8 Ensure adequate mechanisms are in place to preempt and respond to kidnapping
and extortion

**Objective 1**

**•** **To prevent the proliferation of kidnapping, extortion and human**
**trafficking.**

**Specific Actions – Short Term**

a. **MNS,** assisted by MOJ, will establish special legislation to provide for
increased punishment for kidnapping and extortion.

b. **OPM,** assisted by MNS, will encourage the establishment of codes of
conduct in the public sector to make it easier to detect suspicious
activities.


-----

c. **MID assisted by MNS, will develop and conduct a public information and**
awareness campaign to denounce extortion; promote the reporting of
suspicious activities and to resist demands for payment of ransom.

d. **MNS in cooperation with MOJ and MFAFT will establish a Task Force**
to develop and establish effective legislation to address the problems of
human trafficking and promote effective coordination of anti-trafficking
measures, consistent with Jamaica’s international responsibilities.

**Objective 2**

- **Respond promptly and adequately to incidents of kidnapping,**
**extortion and human trafficking.**

**Specific Actions – Short Term**

a. **MNS will implement a dedicated secure system for receiving information**
from the public and for following up kidnapping, extortion and human
trafficking cases.

b. **MNS will ensure training of security personnel to include negotiating**
skills and appropriate use of force.

**c.** **MNS** will ensure the preparation of appropriate contingency plans for
responses to incidents of kidnapping.

**d.** **MNS, in cooperation with MOJ and MFAFT will establish a Task Force**
to develop and establish effective legislation to address the problems of
human trafficking and promote effective coordination of anti-trafficking
measures, consistent with Jamaica’s international responsibilities.

**In addition to the action points above, there are points in SSGs 2**
**(Strengthening of the Justice System), SSG 4 (Protecting and Controlling**
**Jamaica’s Territory) and SSG 5 (Strengthening the Integrity of Democratic**
**Government) that impact directly on the achievement of this Goal. These**
**include issues relating to the efficiency of the Justice System, and the**
**improvement of border control and anti-corruption measures.**


-----

### Goal 2 - To Strengthen the Justice System and Promote Respect for the Rule of Law

3.16  There is need for an effective justice system, which is accountable and
demonstrates fairness in the way people are treated and decisions made. The application
of law should be without fear or favour, requiring that all persons, regardless of their role
in society, comply with the law and deal justly with others. Legislation needs to be
continuously reviewed and revised as offenders use new methodologies, new technology
and other creative ways to avoid prosecution.

3.17  Upholding the rule of law will serve the interest of both primary and secondary
violence prevention, enhance public order, and address or reverse any disillusionment
about the quality and exercise of justice. This goal also addresses the need to effectively
bring to account those who choose to break the law with impunity.

#### Capability 1

3.17.1  Develop an effective integrated and efficient justice system, which engenders
public confidence.

**Objective**

     - **Transform the Justice System to be better able to prevent and**
**investigate crime, prosecute, convict, punish and rehabilitate**
**offenders.**

**Specific Actions – Short Term**

a. A temporary justice system Review Task Force will be established by
**Cabinet Office, MOJ** and MNS to review and oversee the necessary
changes to the overall Justice System, including legislation.

b. **MNS** and DCS to continuously monitor the provision of diagnostic
services to assess offenders (in support of sentencing decisions) with
information on levels of risk to society especially for young/first-time
offenders.

c. **MOJ** and MNS to ensure the availability of adequate multi-disciplinary
support including psychiatrists, forensic scientists and other medical
practitioners, and increased access to social workers for both the
investigative and rehabilitative processes.


-----

d. **MOJ and MNS to install a comprehensive Criminal Justice Management**
Information System.

e. **MOJ** and CPC to ensure more effective policy formulation and
preparation of drafting instructions by the responsible ministries. All
Ministries should also examine the adequacy of the laws they are required
to administer.

f. With guidance from MOJ, all Ministries will broaden consultation among
the relevant stakeholders including civil society in policy formulation and
legislative drafting processes in order to ensure participation, support and
collective ownership.

g. **MOJ to ensure the timely and effective disposal of legal matters through**
modernised court processes (e.g. computerization, steno recording, court
hours), and continued strengthening of  administrative capability of the
courts.

h. **MNS** supported by MFAFT and MOJ will develop extradition treaties
including the establishment of reciprocal working arrangements with
countries with which Jamaica does not currently have this arrangement.
On an ongoing basis, **JCF supported by the** **DPP,** **MNS and** **MOJ will**
increase its use of, and expedite and exploit the opportunities of the
extradition process.

#### Capability 2

3.17.2  Legislation to ensure and enhance the effectiveness of the rule of law.

**Objective**

**•** **Continuously review, and amend as necessary, all legislation to**
**confirm their relevance, levels of punishment and remedies, and to**
**enhance the administration of justice.**

**Specific Actions – Short Term**

a. **MOJ supported by** **MNS** will establish a **Law Commission to identify**
required legislation for drafting/enactment, with the mandate to carry out
the continuous proactive amendment and creation of legislation to ensure
the viability and effectiveness of the justice system.

b. **MNS** with the support of MOJ will develop, expeditiously enact and
systematically enforce effective laws that would lead to the dismantling of
organised criminal gangs and networks (e.g., racketeering laws, Proceeds
of Crime Act, money laundering legislation). Citizenship laws, regulations


-----

and procedures will be strengthened to make it more difficult for
marriages to be arranged to provide cover for organised criminal activity.
Improved mechanisms, including a regulatory framework, to eliminate
illegitimate business enterprises, which provide outlets for hiding the
proceeds of crime, are also to be provided.

#### Capability 3

3.17.3  Law enforcement agencies in the broadest sense need to accept, develop and
enforce a zero tolerance approach to public order and rule of law issues when conducting
their duties.

**Objective**

**•** **To accept, develop and enforce a zero tolerance approach to public**
**disorder and rule of law issues.**

**Specific Action – Short Term**

**MOJ, MNS, JCF and all other MDAs with law enforcement responsibilities are**
to put in place the necessary measures to enforce a zero tolerance approach to
public order breaches and rule of law issues. Concurrently, MNS and MOJ will
conduct a review of the components of the justice system (JCF, Courts, and
Corrections) to ensure that the necessary supporting procedures, laws and systems
are put in place in a timely manner, to cope with the anticipated initial increased
burden on the system. Law enforcement personnel would include diverse
appointments such as traffic wardens, local government building inspectors, forest
rangers, fisheries inspectors, customs and police officers. There may be a
requirement to increase the levels of the law enforcement authority of non-JCF
organisations.

#### Capability 4

3.17.4  Sentencing guidelines and corresponding structures to support the practice of
restorative justice, including the use of non-custodial sentences.

**Objective**

    - **Review and update sentencing guidelines and supporting structures to**
**facilitate greater use of non- custodial sentences or restorative justice**
**practices where appropriate.**


-----

**Specific Actions**

a. Periodic reviews of sentencing guidelines and supporting supervisory
structures by the MOJ in collaboration with the MNS will be done, taking
into consideration alternative sentencing options in order to reduce the
burden on the correctional centres and to provide for appropriate
punishment for low risk offenders.

b. **MOJ to develop public awareness and understanding of the principles and**
value of restorative justice. .

#### Capability 5

3.17.5  Anti-corruption measures need to be strong enough to deter, detect and arrest
corruption in all parts of the justice system.

**Objective**

    - **Elimination of corruption in all parts of the justice system.**

#### Specific Action – Short Term

**MOJ, MNS** and DPP will re-examine with a view to strengthening anticorruption measures.

#### Capability 6

3.17.6   An extensive public education system is needed on the functions and operations
of the justice system, including information on access to justice and procedures at service
locations.

**Objective**

    - **Educate citizens about their rights and responsibilities, and the**
**meaning and application of justice within the context of the**
**Constitution and Laws of Jamaica.**

**Specific Action– Short Term**

**MOJ and MNS to expand existing programmes to educate and inform the public**
on the justice system.


-----

#### Capability 7

3.17.7  Humane facilities for safe, secure custody in police lock-ups, remand and
correctional centres.

**Objective**

**•** **To provide safe and secure facilities to accommodate detainees,**
**remandees and prisoners.**

**Specific Action– Short Term**

**MNS, JCF, DCS** and MOJ will re-examine their detention facilities in
accordance with international standards and modify or rebuild where possible.

#### Capability 8

3.17.8  Mechanisms are required to promote acceptance of alternative methods of
dispute resolution as a problem-solving tool in order to counter the pervasive use of
violence, including domestic violence.

**Objective**

     - **To** **promote use of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.**

**Specific Action– Short Term**

**MOJ, MNS, MOEY and JIS, with the support of NGOs, the church and other**
civil society groups to enhance public education efforts concerning alternative
methods of dispute resolution.

#### Capability 9

3.17.9  Quality legal aid, witness protection and victim support services need to be
developed and maintained.

**Objective**

    - **To expand access to strengthened legal aid, witness protection and**
**victim support services.**


-----

**Specific Action – Short Term**

**MOJ and** **MNS will identify sustainable finance schemes regionally and**
internationally to fund enhancement of legal aid, witness protection and victim
support services, promote their availability through a public awareness
programme and increase accessibility to those in need.

#### Capability 10

3.17.10  Mechanisms to ensure the effective preparation of cases for prosecution to
include enhancing collaboration between the **DPP and the relevant investigative**
agencies, including the JCF.

**Objective**

**•** **To improve the preparation of cases for prosecution.**

**Specific Actions– Short Term**

a. **MOJ, DPP and MNS and all other MDAs with prosecutorial powers will**
strengthen formal mechanisms to provide for better collaboration in the
preparation of cases for prosecution.

b. **JCF to improve its investigative capacities through increased training and**
effective coordination between intelligence and all law enforcement
agencies.

#### Capability 11 

3.17.11  Mechanisms to enable actions in consort with CARICOM, in developing a
common negotiating position with regards to the issue of criminal deportees.

**Objective**

**•** **To conclude agreements with deporting countries facilitating**
**consultations before final decisions for deportations are made.**

**Specific Action– Short Term**

**MNS** supported by MFAFT, where it is not inconsistent with Jamaica’s
immediate national interests, will seek to adopt a common negotiating position on
relevant issues with respect to deportees as discussed in the meeting of
CARICOM minister’s responsible for national security in 2005. These issues
include: verification procedure for identification; pace of deportation; health
status; duration of domicile in the deporting country; and support for reintegration
programmes.


-----

#### Capability 12

3.17.12  Policies and programmes that are geared towards effective rehabilitation and
reintegration of ex-offenders, criminal deportees and youth at risk.

**Objective**

     - **Effective rehabilitation and reintegration of ex-offenders, criminal**
**deportees and youth- at- risk.**

**Specific Actions– Short Term**

a. **MNS, JCF** and DCS to develop/enhance policies and programmes with
appropriate legislative support geared towards effective rehabilitation and
reintegration of ex-offenders, criminal deportees and youth at risk.

b. **MNS supported by MOJ, MLGE** and MLSS will ensure that existing
social support systems, in addition to visible referral and follow-up
programmes are expanded to meet the needs of all ex-offenders and
criminal deportees.

c. A database system will be established by **MNS, to identify and monitor**
criminal deportees who may re-engage in criminal activities and high
security risk visitors, and provide for increased and effective collaboration
on such matters between **MNS** and Immigration, JCF, MFAFT and
**CAA.**

#### Capability 13

3.17.13  Diversion programmes need to be in place that provide intervention for
misguided youth in order to prevent/minimize delinquency and criminal activity and
membership of criminal gangs.

**Objective**

**•** **To provide diversion programmes to allow for alternative means of**
**gainful employment for persons normally engaged in illegal activities**
**with emphasis on youth.**

**Specific Action– Short Term**

**MOJ, MNS** and DCS to introduce diversion programmes that provide
opportunities for misguided youth in order to prevent/minimize delinquency and
criminal activity.


-----

### Goal 3 - To Protect Jamaica from Terrorism 

3.18 The scope of this goal includes the prevention of terrorist incidents, having
contingency plans to adequately respond to incidents and having the capability to
mitigate the effects of terrorism. The capabilities that are needed to adequately address
these vulnerabilities are geared towards the ability to monitor and analyse potential
terrorist activities; the ability to prevent or respond to terrorist incidents in terms of
immediate action, mitigation of direct effects, recovery and rehabilitation; and the ability
to engage the public internally and externally to mitigate the indirect effects that may
arise due to inaccurate or exaggerated perceptions of the situation. Indirect effects
include economic fallout from negative perceptions within the international community.
The need for regional and international co-operative mechanisms is paramount.

**Specific Capability, Objectives and Actions**

#### Capability 1

3.18.1  The capacity to prevent terrorist incidents requires proactive security
initiative. This is dependent on the ability to sustain an effective intelligence mechanism
to include cooperation with intelligence and enforcement bodies regionally and
internationally. This is to ensure the effective monitoring and tracking of people and
goods transiting Jamaica as well as the monitoring and control of financial flows,
particularly cross-border activities. Jamaica is unlikely to have adequate direct access to
foreign intelligence resources without increased international cooperation.

**Objective**

      - **To** **make Jamaica’s intelligence apparatus more effective by**
**instituting measures to improve coordination amongst national,**
**regional and international agencies with regard to terrorism-related**
**intelligence, and by establishing a State intelligence agency to handle**
**strategic intelligence needs.**

**Specific Action - Short Term**

**MNS will take a number of steps to maintain an effective intelligence system.**
This includes the establishment of protocols and mechanisms to facilitate sharing
between national agencies, and regional and international partners; putting
systems in place to facilitate sharing with INTERPOL and other like international
agencies; the review and establishment of a system for coordination and sharing
of high level intelligence and of tactical/operational intelligence; establishing the
**NSIA, or similar agency, as the national focal point for international coordination**
of intelligence sharing and reviewing the intelligence-sharing between **JDF and**
**JCF as a part of their strategic reviews.**


-----

#### Capability 2

3.18.2  An adequate border control and national identification system is required as
elaborated in SSG 4 (Protect and Control Jamaica’s Territory) and systems to maintain an
adequate level of public awareness as elaborated in the cross-cutting issues section.

**Objective**

    - **To strengthen systems and mechanisms for border control and for**
**national identification**

**Specific Actions – Short Term**

a. In keeping with SSG 4, the **MOH** supported by the **MNS and other**
interested MDAs will within two years ensure the establishment of
compulsory national registration system for Jamaican citizens, and review
the possible need for a national ID card.

b. **MNS** will implement systems and regulations requiring all Jamaicans to
have machine readable passports on entry and exit; complete
computerization of the immigration system; provide a database/network
that links ports of entry, and enables tracking of entry and exit of all
persons; promote and coordinate regional minimum identification system
requirements for entry and exit through CARICOM; and review
requirements for citizenship.

#### Capability 3

3.18.3   Effective anti-terrorism legislation and enforcement mechanisms need to be
maintained in order to act on collated intelligence. They should conform to international
obligations and responsibilities, and also meet national requirements. This capacity
should encompass the ability to prevent the use of, and confiscation of funds associated
with terrorist activities. This should be supported by the capacity for effective interagency co-operation and information sharing in Jamaica, and the ability to draw on
societal support for prevention of terrorism, through public education, increased
awareness and improved community-police relations for confidence building.

**Objective**

**•** **Assess the new anti-terrorism legislation to determine its effectiveness**
**and its conformity with international obligations. This should include**
appropriate legislation relating to the control and confiscation of funds
linked to terrorism and ensure the enforcement of these legislations and
the signing/ratification of the relevant international agreements on
terrorism that are in keeping with Jamaica’s national interests. In addition,
capabilities of the relevant agencies to enforce anti-terrorism legislation


-----

and allow for the confiscation of funds linked to terrorist activities are to
be improved.

**Specific Actions - Short Term**

a. **MOJ and MFAFT will implement the associated regulations concerning**
the Anti-Terrorism Act. **MNS** and MFP will provide the necessary
structures and resources to enable the effective enforcement of the
legislation, including the training of the police and other investigation
authorities, within a year. They also need to ensure that the required
institutional arrangements are in place in the same time frame.

b. **MOJ** and MFAFT will ensure that there are provisions in the Money
Laundering and Proceeds of Crime Bills to address terrorism issues,
including preventing terrorist financing and allowing for the confiscation
of funds.

c. **MFAFT** and MOJ will ensure the signing/ratification of relevant
international agreements. The establishment of review processes will
support this to determine which international obligations should be ratified
into domestic law. They will also ensure that terrorist offences are
included in the terms of mutual extradition treaties. The supporting
regulations should be in place within six months of the enactments.

d. **MNS will review the roles and function of its agencies, ensuring they are**
clearly specified according to areas of responsibility. As a part of the
protocol on JDF/JCF relations proposed for SSG 4, the JCF will lead on
the detection and initial monitoring of terrorist threats at least until the
proposed **NSIA is established, and the** **JDF will lead on operational**
response to these threats.

e. As Jamaica is host to several international and multinational organisations
and international events, MNS and MFAFT will put enhanced measures
in place to ensure the security of international groups and individuals who
participate or attend events, such as Cricket World Cup 2007 (CWC
2007).

#### Capability 4

3.18.4 **A system for the preparation and testing of contingency plans to respond to**
**incidents.** There needs to be effective ‘civil defence’ contingency plans, by the
responsible institutions. They should include the capacity to respond effectively to
warnings of terrorist incidents and the ability to respond to terrorist incidents through the
implementation of contingency plans. The provision of resources needed to implement


-----

the contingency plans is an essential requirement. These resources should include
effective information management and efficient communications systems.

In order to implement the contingency plans, there needs to be trained response teams.
These response teams should have the ability to execute counter-terrorism operations
based on rehearsed contingency plans through realistic exercises.

**Objective**

     - **To establish and maintain contingency plans for responding to**
**terrorist incidents as well as improving public awareness and**
**knowledge of the potential dangers of terrorism.**

**Specific Actions – Short Term**

a. **MNS will lead in the tasking of a multi-agency body to review and define**
planning needs and capabilities required to address the full range of
anti-terrorist contingencies including investigation protocols and training
to handle situations before, during and after terrorist incidents. In keeping
with these requirements, the **JDF supported by the** **JCF and** **ODPEM**
should, within a year, establish trained and equipped response teams with
the ability to execute counter-terrorism operations based on contingency
plans, which have been rehearsed and updated through realistic exercises.

b. The National Security Council (NSC) needs also to develop the capacity
to assume policy direction over crisis response.

**_Capability 5_**

3.18.5   Public information programmes to mitigate indirect effects of terrorist
**incidents. Without an effective information management and communications system,**
Jamaica is highly susceptible to damage to its reputation and loss of economic activity in
the event of a terrorist incident or threats thereof. Jamaica needs to have the capacity to
effectively communicate with the local and international community in order to limit
damage to its reputation and interests in such eventualities.

**Objective**

**•** **Maintain an effective local and international communications system**
**to mitigate the impacts of terrorist incidents.**

**Specific Action – Short Term**

a. **MNS** with the support of the JIS will ensure the existence of effective
information management and communications systems including
launching public information programmes relating to: sensitisation of the


-----

public on suspicious activities and reporting geared at reducing risks of
terror acts and how to act in event of terrorist incidents.


-----

### Goal 4 -To Protect and Control Jamaica’s Territory 

3.19 As an independent and sovereign nation, Jamaica must retain the capacity to
defend its national interest against the threats of hostile foreign States or other non-state
organisations with all the resources at its disposal, including the military. Transnational
threats, including organised criminal activities, undermine regional and international
peace and security and national sovereignty. While Jamaica acting alone may not be able
to provide for traditional defence of the country against a superior external military force,
the security forces will adopt appropriate means of warfare to defend the country. At a
minimum, there should be a capability to provide sufficient delay to allow for the
triggering of other contingencies. The complexity of the threats requires regional and
international cooperation for the development and implementation of effective counter
measures. Jamaica needs to adopt and implement the best border management practices,
to encompass the maritime, air and land mass/spaces and ports of entry and to minimize
the risk of transnational threats. This is important because of the growing ability of nonState actors to act transnationally.

#### Capability 1

3.19.1  Capacity to ensure cooperation and coordination between agencies with
**related or overlapping responsibilities. It is only by doing so that the limited resources**
can be effectively used to realise the full benefits of their employment. Without clear
demarcation of responsibilities and lead roles, there could be unnecessary redundancy in
allocating resources and the employment of personnel.

**Objective**

     - **To establish a protocol to govern cooperation between agencies with**
**similar or overlapping responsibilities particularly the JDF and JCF**
**thereby ensuring clear indication of lead roles.**

**Specific Actions – Short Term**

a. **MNS in consultation with the JDF and the JCF will establish a protocol**
governing cooperation and the division of responsibilities between JDF
and **JCF including lead roles as indicated below. This should be**
implemented within six months. The establishment of the protocol itself
requires appropriate legal staff and representatives from the affected
agencies; however detailed strategic reviews of the JDF and JCF should
be conducted to ensure they are adequately structured, equipped and
financed to effect their responsibilities as defined by the protocol.

b. **The JDF should lead on all National Security matters within**
**Jamaica’s maritime territory including counter narcotics and arms**


-----

**trafficking. JDF has constabulary powers for offences in the maritime**
environment based on the Maritime Areas Act, the Exclusive Economic
Zone Act and the Fisheries Act. The present practice is for JDF to search,
apprehend and detain, then hand over to the JCF, with the knowledge of
NEPA, Customs and/or the Fisheries Division at a designated port. This
practice works and should continue with no decrease in the present **JDF**
powers. The **JCF is neither trained nor equipped for deep sea or ‘blue**
water’ operations or to cover extensive maritime areas. Any attempt to so
equip them would result in duplication and redundancies and is not
recommended. Delineation of authority is important to avoid overlap. It is
decided that areas outside the baseline from which the territorial seas are
measured (approximately half a mile from the main land to the north and
to encompass Portland Bight in the south) should be the responsibility of
**JDF. Areas within the baseline of the landward side should be the**
responsibility of the **JCF, excluding the areas around Morant and Pedro**
Cays.

c. The **JDF should lead on traditional military threats (including NBC**
attack). Initial insurgent activity would be within the purview of the JCF
but would be handed over to the **JDF at some point of escalation, to be**
determined by the NSC.

d. The **JCF should lead on all internal security matters under normal**
circumstances. There should be the delineation of three levels of JCF/JDF
involvement in internal security matters:

**Level 1 - JCF operating alone. This should remain the norm, as**
it is not desirable for military forces to be routinely involved in law
enforcement operations.

**Level 2 - JCF leading with JDF assisting as directed by the**
**PM/Minister of Defence. This should be specific time-limited**
operation in the case of situations that call for joint operations to
address serious threats to national security. In extreme cases, this
would include the **JDF acting with increased powers as provided**
under the Emergency Powers Act to restore and maintain law and
order.

**Level 3 - JDF leading with JCF assisting as declared by the**
**Governor General** or in keeping with other Constitutional
arrangements. This should be until the status quo is restored.

e. The initial detection and monitoring of suspected terrorist groups will be
the responsibility of the **JCF,** at least until the proposed NSIA is
established. The response to incidents is within the purview of the JCF
until terrorist involvement is clearly established at which point, the NSC


-----

would authorise the change of lead to the  JDF. The JDF will lead on the
operational response to terrorist threats, to include acting on intelligence to
preempt an incident as directed by the NSC.

f. **MNS will lead in development of a national security programme covering**
national policy, overarching legislation, sectoral responsibilities and a
mechanism for implementation for aviation and maritime security at
airport and seaports. This programme will be consistent with national
security policy objectives and international rules provided by the relevant
conventions of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and
the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) adopted by Jamaica, and
the specific civil aviation and maritime sectoral responsibilities of the
**CAA, PAJ and** **MAJ. The** **CAA will improve the capability to detect**
unauthorised aircraft, particularly through use of radar systems, and relay
information on unauthorised aircraft activities to the JDF and the JCF for
their respective responses by land, air and sea.

#### Capability 2

3.19.2  Capacity to identify Jamaican nationals in a timely way and to monitor the
movements of migrants, criminals, deportees and other individuals of security concern.

**Objective**

**•** **Establish an adequate national identification system**

**Specific Action – Medium Term**

**MOH is to expedite action on a national identification system, incorporating**
biometrics, that could be assigned at birth and be a requirement for all official
activities including schooling, employment and conducting business. They
should also conduct a review of the national identification card system to
determine whether a unique card bearing the national identification number is
required and whether this can replace other national identification cards such as
the voter registration card.

#### Capability 3

3.19.3   Capacity to manage refugees, asylum seekers and migrants - The risk of
instability in neighbouring countries implies that there may be a significant influx of
refugees, asylum seekers and migrants. Jamaica should have the capability to manage
extraordinary numbers of these categories of persons to include having systems and
facilities in place locally, and the ability to coordinate with United Nations’ bodies and
non-governmental organisations {NGOs}. The management systems should include the


-----

capability to receive and process applications for asylum as well as related appeals.
Jamaica requires legislation to fully implement the provisions of the 1951 Convention on
the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. See SSG 6, which relates to Jamaica’s
contribution to regional and international security, for specific objectives relevant to this
issue.

**Objective**

**•** **Establish a formal system/mechanism for the management of**
**refugees, asylum seekers and migrants.**

**Specific Actions –Medium Term**

a. **MNS** assisted by MFAFT will review the function and operation of the
existing ad hoc-management system; carry out consultations and
coordinate approaches with the relevant government entities and nongovernmental organisations to formulate and establish an effective
management system; develop adequate standards for the provision of
facilities, medical care and food for refugees, asylum seekers and
migrants; establish a formal structure to deal with applications and
interviews for refugee and asylum status; and develop and establish a
formal appeal procedure for applicants for refugee and asylum status.

b. **MNS and MOJ should review the existing means by which persons may**
legitimately claim Jamaican citizenship with a view to preventing abuse.

#### Capability 4

3.19.4    Capacity to monitor and control the entry and exit of goods and persons in and
out of Jamaica irrespective of the means and access points used, whether they be
authorised points of entry (POE) such as sea ports, airports and post offices, or
unauthorised POEs including the coastline and private fields that can facilitate aircraft
operation. The cruise-ship industry has already implemented comprehensive strict
maritime security control measures under the International Ship and Port Facility
Security (ISPS) Code. However, Jamaica should have the capacity to ensure that proper
liaison is carried out between the Port Facility Security Officers (PFSO), the Port State
Control Officers (PSCO) and immigration. This should include general declarations of
the passenger manifest, where this is not already being done, consistent with national and
international   requirements.

**Objective**

**•** **To complete the overhaul and strengthening of the system of border**
**control** **including** **mechanisms** **to** **improve** **cooperation** **and**
**coordination of Immigrations, Customs and Police where appropriate,**
**to ensure that processing at ports for relief cargo and personnel is**
**sufficient. This overhaul should include a review of procedures to**
**ensure better monitoring of private airfields; the development of**


-----

**policies and the building and upgrading of technological capacity to**
**monitor and control access to unauthorised points of entry and**
**ensuring adequate surveillance, monitoring and control of Jamaica’s**
**air space and marine areas.**

**Specific Actions – Short Term**

a. **MNS** supported by MFP (Customs), MFAFT, and MHTWW should
complete the overhaul and strengthening of the system of border control.
The reorganisation of the operations of Immigration and Customs should
be completed within one year. In that process, the implications of the freer
movement of CARICOM nationals occasioned by the implementation of
the CSME should be taken into consideration.

b. **MNS supported by** **MFP will negotiate special arrangements for**
enhancing border control processes for major international events hosted
by Jamaica.  Cricket World Cup 2007, will be the first significant test of
the updated systems and procedures.

c. **MNS and** **MFP should agree to an appropriate protocol for coordinating**
the operations of the JCF, Immigration and Customs. The protocol should
include a shared database, and the sharing of related intelligence. The
sharing of information between Customs and Immigration should be
effected within six months.

#### Capability 5

3.19.5   Capacity to monitor and enforce the laws and regulations pertaining to the use
of Jamaica’s airspace, coastal waters and EEZ. The regulatory framework includes the
Customs Act, Fisheries Act and the maritime environmental protection laws.

**Objective**

     - **Ensure that there are sufficient resources and an adequate structure**
**to undertake regular surveillance of the EEZ by air and sea to detect**
**vessels and aircraft and to monitor and control their use of the air and**
**sea space. This should include the necessary regulatory framework to**
**allow for effective enforcement including customs, fisheries and**
**environmental protection.**

**Specific Action – Short Term**

**MNS** and MFP will improve resources available to the **JCF and** **JDF to make**
them better able to monitor coastal areas, and within two years ensure adequate


-----

resources for air and maritime surveillance. The **JCF and** **JDF should, on an**
ongoing basis, identify and disable locations used for the illegal operation of
aircraft and increase the monitoring of locations that provide potential landing
opportunities.

#### Capability 6

3.19.6 The ability to acquire credible intelligence that will identify insurgents and their
means of support and sustenance and thereby inform appropriate security, informational
and policy responses to isolate insurgents from their support, promote support for the
constituted authority, and suppress unlawful insurgent activities.

**Objective**

     - **To maintain a credible intelligence service that will constantly assess**
**the factors likely to contribute to the development of an insurgent**
**movement and will keep the National Security Council and the**
**minister responsible for security fully apprised on the emergence or**
**development of an insurgent threat.**

**Specific Actions**

a. **MNS will establish protocols, within six months, to ensure more formal**
and consistent information sharing between private security companies
and the police. **MNS should establish, within six months, protocols with**
non-intelligence agencies that frequently handle potentially useful data
such as CAA, Immigration and Customs.

b. **MNS will expedite measures to secure the relevant decisions and**
directives to have the **NSIA established and will ensure that priority**
intelligence requirements of the State are assigned to the appropriate
intelligence agencies.

#### Capability 7

3.19.7   Jamaica must maintain a credible military capacity to defend itself against
military threats.

**Objective**

     - **To maintain military readiness to provide a meaningful and extended**
**resistance to external military threats and protect the country from**
**capitulation to hostile external forces.**


-----

**Specific Actions**

a. **JDF will conduct, within six months, a comprehensive Strategic Defence**
**Review to ensure the appropriate military structure. This could subsume**
the review mentioned above regarding **JDF/JCF collaboration on IS**
matters.

b. **MNS** and MFP will provide, within a year, the necessary resources to
ensure the required military capability to defend against or delay external
military threats. The JDF should ensure that adequate training takes place
to meet this requirement.

c. **MNS and JDF will lead on the policy direction and operational response,**
respectively, to nuclear threats. **MOH will lead on the response to**
incidents involving the use of biological agents, and **MLGE (ODPEM)**
will coordinate the response actions to chemical incidents. The NSIA will
be mandated to advice on the specific threats.

#### Capability 8

3.19.8  Agreed protocols and enhanced understandings with our traditional partners on
security namely, the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada, as well as other
friendly states within CARICOM, the OAS, regarding mutual assistance in times of
security crises.

**Objective**

    - **To conclude formal agreements and develop understandings with**
**regional and international partners in security regarding framework**
**for security cooperation in the event of hostilities.**

**Specific Action**

**MNS** supported by MFAFT will immediately initiate discussions with existing
and potential allies with a view to securing agreements to enhance Jamaica’s
security. They should, within a year, review existing agreements, whether formal
or informal, that relate to Jamaica’s security, and aim within three years, to
negotiate, sign and (where appropriate) ratify improved agreements relevant to
Jamaica’s security.


-----

### Goal 5 - To Strengthen the Integrity of Institutions of Democratic Government

3.20 Governance is the exercise of power in the economic, political and administrative
management of a country’s resources. Good democratic governance includes openness,
justice, equity, inclusiveness, and accountability and embraces the respect for civil rights.
It comprises the traditions, institutions and processes that determine how power is shared
and exercised; how decisions are made and how authority responds on issues of public
concern. Jamaicans demand improved efficiency, economy and effectiveness of
Government resources. The Government faces increased pressure to decentralize
operations, decrease the levels of bureaucracy and reduce the size of the public service.
An effective public service will lead to public confidence and contribute to providing a
stable and secure environment for Jamaica.

3.21 Structures, laws and procedures need to be enhanced or established to
aggressively eradicate corruption in public life primarily, and to remove the culture of
corruption in the society as a whole. In order to strengthen the integrity of the institutions
of democratic governance, the government and people of Jamaica need to join in
partnership to combat the negative effects of social discrimination through the exclusion
of certain groups from the democratic process, garrison politics and the associated ills,
poor physical and other conditions of service under which some public servants work,
centralization of essential services and real and perceived corruption among public
officials.

3.22 Effective systems to promote and sustain transparency within the public sector are
necessary to tackle the perceived and/or real lack of transparency in the operations of
many public sector institutions. These systems would also facilitate improved access by
the public to government and other public sector institutions and services. Systems
implemented must include the necessary checks and balances to ensure both effectiveness
and accountability. There must also be scheduled review periods to facilitate their
currency and appropriateness. Built into such checks and balances must be the collective
responsibility of the particular organisation, and by extension government, to the society,
as well as the individual accountability of the leadership elements for their performance.

3.23 An enhanced code of conduct for Ministers,  Parliamentarians and other public
and private sector officials needs to be implemented and enforced. This will ensure that
the perceived and actual lack of ethics with respect to Government and other public
officials, as well as members of the private sector will be addressed.

#### Capability 1

3.23.1  Vibrant democratic institutions including the Constitutional Opposition, a free
press and appropriate regulatory framework that afford citizens safeguards against abuses


-----

of State power and provide credible means for pursuing redress where they perceive that
such abuse has occurred.

#### Objective

    - **Protect Jamaica’s democratic institutions, including the offices of the**
**Political Ombudsman, the Public Defender the Children Advocate,**
**the Electoral Advisory Commission and also the work on the Charter**
**of Rights.**

**Specific Action**

**MFP is to ensure that the requisite resources are provided to guarantee the**
viability of democratic institutions that depend on State resources to maintain
good quality service to the public.

#### Capability 2

3.23.2   A legislative framework that prescribes effective tools, rules and procedures to
empower and shield investigative and regulatory bodies to enable them to execute their
mandates in a transparent, just and credible manner, as well as an enhanced code of
conduct for Ministers of Government and other Parliamentarians. These provisions will
aid in public confidence building.

**Objective**

**•** **Strengthen the integrity of public institutions and eradicate**
**corruption by preventing, detecting and deterring corruption, and**
**consistently enforcing law and order.**

**Specific Actions– Short Term**

a. **Cabinet Office will enhance measures to prevent, detect and deter**
corruption in the public service. The reinforcement of this will include the
review of current systems and procedures and the rationalisation of staff,
within a year. Effective sanctions and penalties will be introduced and
existing ones strengthened in order to adequately and expeditiously deal
with breaches.

b. **MOJ** will enhance the analytical and investigative capacity of the
Commission for the Prevention of Corruption, which is intended to carry
out investigations into abuses and corrupt practices. This enhancement
will address increased staffing and facilitate the review and amendment of
the legislative framework over time. The review and necessary
implementation will be completed within twelve months.


-----

c. Provisions will also be made to protect persons who provide information
on corrupt actions, which will be done through the passage of legislation
and/or the appointment of a ‘Confidential Ombudsman’, and to consider
expanding the jurisdiction of the Commission beyond the public sector.
**MNS and** **MOJ** will establish the monitoring framework within a year.
There must also be periodic updates of the security vetting system within
the public sector, particularly for sensitive positions.

d. Stringent security vetting standards will be enforced for the beneficiaries
of Government contracts. The reviews and necessary changes will be
completed by the NCC in collaboration with the MFP and the MOJ.

e. **The** **Cabinet Office will also aggressively pursue the institutionalisation**
of the Performance Based Management System (PBMS) within the public
sector. **MLSS will develop standards and performance measurement**
parameters in order to facilitate the full implementation of the PBMS.
This will establish a framework to allow for public scrutiny of the
operations of MDAs, which will serve to complement the Access to
Information Act and other GOJ initiatives aimed at greater transparency
within the public sector.

#### Capability 3

3.23.3  Effective governance structures at the level of the community to ensure that
services provided by the State are delivered to the persons for whom they were intended
in a transparent and fair manner.

**Objective**

    - **Strengthen local governance structures and build effective working**
**partnerships with the local police and associated agencies.**

**Specific Actions**

a. **MNS is to ensure that the philosophy of community policing becomes**
institutionalised across all Police Divisions. Special attention is to be paid
to the prevalence of sexual offences such as rape, carnal abuse and incest,
which are often unreported because of the attached stigmatization.

b. **OPM (SDC) supported by MNS, should forge ahead with the**
establishment of legitimate community-based organisations such as
Community Development Councils or Community Safety and Security
Groups throughout communities. **MLGE will establish security sub-**
committees within local government (Parish Councils) that will examine


-----

and coordinate action on public order security related issues, particularly
as they relate to law enforcement agencies, to better safeguard
communities island wide.

#### Capability 4

3.23.4   A cadre of civil servants at all grades throughout the public service that is
recognised by the public as professional, courteous, and responsive to the public.

**Objective**

     - **An open and impartial public service in which valued and respected**
**professionals deliver high quality services efficiently and effectively in**
**order to safeguard the public’s interest.**

**Specific Actions– Short Term**

a. **The** **Cabinet Office supported by** **MLGE** and MOEY will facilitate
programmes for the enhanced training and development of the existing
public sector staff in order to address the problem of poor work ethics
within the public sector.  Concurrently, there will be need to increase the
public’s awareness of the role and value of local government. This will be
completed within one year and implemented in the following six months.

b. **The Cabinet** **Office supported by the OPM (the SDC) will expedite the**
Institutionalisation of the Code of Consultation for the Public Sector
within one year. The implementation will encompass the establishment of
capacities and mechanisms for conducting effective consultation processes
across Government as well as regular evaluation of practices.

c. **The Cabinet Office is to pursue the adoption and institutionalisation of**
core values across **MDAs.  A comprehensive training needs analysis of**
the public sector is to be conducted and formal training opportunities
created to address these over the next 18 months.  Each MDA is required
to participate in the needs analysis and support the implementation of the
training. Ultimately, this will lead to increased retention of quality staff
and the improved delivery of services and overall professionalism of the
public service.

d. **OPM and MLSS in collaboration with MOEY, will seek to improve and**
increase the number of programmes designed to mentor youth. The
identification of areas for improvement and new initiatives will be
completed within six months followed by implementation. **MOEY,**
**MLSS** and OPM, will continually develop, improve and implement


-----

educational and skills training opportunities aimed particularly at youth-atrisk. The objective is to increase public confidence in the constituted
authority and provide a viable alternative to the lure of criminality within
Jamaica.

**Specific Actions– Medium Term**

a. The Ministry responsible for community development (OPM) will
establish effective framework/models, based on domestic and international
best practices, for the development of regional, parish and communitydevelopment committees. Concurrently, the framework for the
implementation of joint public/private sector programmes aimed at the
sustained financing of the development committees will also be
developed.

b. **MFP and MLSS will continue the review and improvement of the public**
sector compensation schemes and seek to improve working conditions
within the public service. Additionally, the professional development and
training of public officials will be significantly enhanced to include
increased access to tertiary level educational opportunities as well as inservice training.

### Goal 6 -To Increase Jamaica’s Contribution to Regional    and International Security

3.24 Jamaica is integrally involved in regional and international efforts to promote and
maintain international peace and security. In this regard, the country continues to cooperate and plays an active role in the development and implementation of regional and
international security initiatives and measures with the primary national security
objective being to: secure Jamaica’s borders, protect its sovereignty and integrity; secure
its maritime areas of jurisdiction and air space; and ultimately protect its citizens.

3.25 The State’s interests and contributions in regional and international security are
also viewed within the context of the country’s need to create a secure environment for
its citizens to experience freedom and to effectively contribute to economic growth and
development.  Additionally, the security and economic stability of Jamaica’s trading
partners in the Caribbean, the wider hemisphere and the global community, are relevant
to the country’s security and development.

3.26 A CARICOM Regional Task Force on Crime and Security has proposed the
establishment of a management structure for the regional crime and security agenda.
Included in this structure is an Implementation Agency for Crime and Security
(IMPACS) and a Coordinating Authority for Information Management (CIMA), which
would both assist in the co-ordination and processing of relevant security information.
The NSP recognises the importance of these mechanisms and provides for the appropriate
linkages at the policy-making level and implementation stages.

3.27 The wide-ranging issues affecting regional and international security require
effective and coordinated policies and operational measures among countries for
improvement in peace and security. Jamaica is expected to maintain its leadership role in
the region and, as such, will be fully prepared to effectively contribute to regional
security with the required capabilities to counter the dynamic security challenges, which
threaten national and regional security. Jamaica should therefore have the necessary
capabilities to strengthen its commitment to international efforts in the maintenance of
global peace and security and to implement international security measures, including
relevant UN Security Council resolutions.

3.28 Jamaica requires legislation to fully implement the provisions of a number of
international legal instruments to which it is a signatory, including the International
Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and its Protocols, the International
Convention against the Illicit Trafficking in Narcotics and its Protocols, and the
International Convention against Terrorist Financing.

3.29 The security concerns in the region and the international community are
compounded by the potential for increased terrorist activities, the illicit trafficking in
narcotic drugs, the illegal trade in small arms and ammunition, and the prevalence of
money laundering and transactional organised crime.


-----

### Goal 7- To Provide the Environment for a Stable Economy and Effective Delivery of Social Services

3.30 The Government has a responsibility to combat financial crimes and to
implement sound macro-economic policies and programmes to create a society in which
each citizen has the prospect for a better quality of life. There is need to ensure that
regulatory and other measures are geared towards strengthening the financial system,
stimulating investment, encouraging tax compliance and facilitating sustainable
economic growth and development in a secure and stable environment. It is also
essential to counter the methods used by individuals, groups and organisations to earn,
move and store illicit funds. This will help to enhance and maintain the integrity of
Jamaica’s economic system and to close the conduits via which national security may be
compromised. The Government will also foster an environment that provides access to
economic opportunities and reduce the dependency on illegal activities, particularly
among persons in the lower socio-economic bracket.

3.31 The Government has a role to protect and preserve the fundamental human rights
of all Jamaican citizens and to provide access to basic education, health, shelter, and
effective systems for the provision of other social services. The protection of the most
vulnerable and the alleviation of poverty are also government objectives for a stable and
secure environment. Social stability and development are essential contributing factors to
the strengthening of national security; hence it is critical that the social dimension is
incorporated in Jamaica’s national security policy. Unemployment, low standards of
living and poor social infrastructure contribute to social, economic and political
instability. Improvements in the social sector are required and the country needs the
capability to ensure that social threats can be eliminated or reduced.

**For a Stable Economic Environment**

####  Capability 1 

3.31.1 An effective legislative, regulatory and supervisory policy framework for the
entire financial sector that minimizes exposure to the risk of financial crises,
while facilitating a high level of compliance with appropriate sanctions for tax
evasion, fraud, corruption and the proceeds of crime.

c. All **MDAs** will ensure that adequate risk mitigation, prevention and
response contingency plans are developed and implemented, to protect
critical economic and physical infrastructure and the essential services
from disasters and criminal activities, such as sabotage, terrorism and
accidents. Emergency response contingency plans are to be coordinated by
the **ODPEM and filed with the NSSIU and the National Disaster**
Committee.

**Objective**

### Goal 8 - To Protect Jamaica’s Natural Resources and Reduce the Risk of Disasters 

3.32 Jamaica’s natural resources are important national assets, which need to be
protected. Measures to prevent, limit and respond to activities, which cause unsustainable
degradation of precious natural resources, are a security concern. With sustainable
development as an underlying theme, this goal first focuses on the protection of natural
resources by ensuring sustainable use of land, marine and ecosystems, through
education, enforcement and further development of environmental regulations. It also
includes regional and international cooperation to prevent and reduce global
environmental problems, including climate change and desertification.

3.33 Jamaica has continuously been affected by natural and man-made hazards. These
have created significant physical damage, severely disrupted the livelihoods of many,
impeded the country’s economic growth and threatened national security.

3.34 This goal further concentrates on: disaster management, which includes the
development or revision of disaster plans for all hazards; national awareness
programmes; development planning, and forecasting; and improved response capabilities.
Implementation of sustainable mitigation measures from international, regional, national
and community levels is included. The goal additionally focuses on the island’s
capability to deal with emerging man-made disaster risks such as terrorism and major
shipping accidents involving nuclear materials.

3.35 In the case of a major airline accident, Jamaica is adequately equipped to respond
to incidents at the two international airports but responders should receive additional
training and resources as there may be challenges should an aviation disaster occur
elsewhere. In the case of a major shipping accident, Jamaica has a first response
capability, but the resources to sustain effective actions are limited. In the specific case
of nuclear hazards, Jamaica will need to discourage the transit of such materials through
international and regional lobbying.

3.36 First responder to disasters, such as the **JDF and the** **Jamaica Fire Brigade,**
require adequate resources and additional training in specialised areas. These include the
capacity to handle hazardous, noxious spills and other man-made disasters, including
chemical and other fires.

**Protection of natural resources**

#### Capability 1

3.36.1  The capability to provide surveillance and monitoring of the use of natural
resources on land, air and sea.

## CHAPTER 4: – COORDINATING AND MONITORING MECHANISMS

- Conceptual framework

- National Security Strategy Implementation Unit (NSSIU)

- Specific mechanisms

- Coordination of intelligence

- Enhancing programmes to promote community safety and security

- National Strategic Communications Programme

- The public’s involvement in implementing the NSP

- Funding priorities

### Conceptual framework 

4.1 Taken together, the policy direction and actions articulated in this strategy are
intended to bring about transformation in attitudes, processes and practices in relation to
how Jamaica goes about assuring its security. The analysis identified many capabilities
that already exist and initiatives that are at various stages of implementation; these
provide a very good base on which to construct Jamaica’s desired future.

4.2 Transformation does not result from the normal course of development. The
many laudable actions being undertaken by Ministries of Government, private sector
groups, churches, NGOs, academia and the rest of civil society, will lose the potential to
transform unless there is unity of purpose, mutual support, and continuous reinforcing.
Transformation requires first, an injection of energy at several institutional levels to drive
change processes in the direction of unity of purpose for collective survival. Second, an
injection of capital to close the critical capabilities gap to neutralise our critical
vulnerabilities, must accompany the other change processes. Third, unity of effort and
capacity building should be sustained for lasting transformation.

4.3 Existing mechanisms for coordinating Government priorities were examined and
it has been determined that the National Security Council (NSC), chaired by the Prime
Minister, is best suited to own the responsibility for the implementation of the NSP.  The
mandate of the NSC is to be expanded to reflect this added responsibility and to include a
formal biennial review of the National Security Policy. It may be necessary to include on
the Council, the ministers holding responsibility for finance, foreign affairs and
information. This additional mandate will necessitate a schedule of regular meetings with
specific agenda items relating directly to the implementation of the NSP. The NSC will
report to Cabinet, and Cabinet to Parliament. Parliament has recently established a Select
Committee on National Security. See Annex D for a diagram of Jamaica’s future
security sector and coordinating mechanism.


-----

### National Security Strategy Implementation Unit 

4.4 **A National Security Strategy Implementation Unit (NSSIU) appointed by the**
**National Security Council (NSC) is to be established in the Cabinet Office as a**
forerunner to the permanent structures of the NSC. The NSSIU will carry out the day- to
-day co-ordination, target setting, monitoring and assessments required to implement the
NSP, in addition to driving the transformation process on behalf of the NSC. The
Executive Director of the NSSIU, who should be of the rank of Permanent Secretary, will
be accountable to the NSC. Other senior members of the NSSIU staff would be drawn
from relevant ministries that have a primary stake in achieving NSP goals. A small
research. evaluation and administrative staff will be required.

4.5 The Executive Director of the NSSIU will report ultimately to the Prime Minister,
but routinely to the Cabinet Secretary. He/She will temporarily function as the Secretary
to the NSC, in addition to providing direction and control of the NSSIU and ensuring that
the NSP is implemented across government on behalf of the NSC.

4.6 Functions to be performed by the NSSIU include:

    - Assisting Permanent Secretaries, CEOs, and managers in making
operational, key elements of the NSP and managing the integration of the
NSP across government;

    - The convening of joint meetings to confirm responsibilities, actions and
timelines as mandated by the NSP. The NSSIU will be responsible for
developing a mechanism for target setting and monitoring, which will
allow for easy identification of actions required, responsibilities and the
effective meeting of deadlines;

    - Monitoring and technical assessment of progress in implementing the
NSP. The  evidence of implementation will include confirming that the
required structures, policies, infrastructure, personnel and equipment are
in place where necessary;

    - Evaluation of general implementation of the NSP (and its Special
Security Initiatives, in particular). The NSSIU will determine
benchmarks in order to verify that the actions being carried out are
effective in meeting the Strategic Security Goals and Objectives.
Indicators of progress will be developed and this will include sector
performance targets;

    - Channelling of information and technical assessments on the progress of
the implementation process to the NSC. The NSSIU will do some
troubleshooting, and will keep the NSC regularly informed on progress
and challenges encountered;


-----

    - Resolving conflicts that arise during the course of implementation of the
NSP as MDAs seek to coordinate their actions;

    - Promoting and supporting a programme of public information to
improve understanding of national security issues and to communicate
progress towards achievements of National Security goals;

    - Reviewing policies being developed by MDAs to ensure consistency
with the NSP;

    - The coordination of actions relating to the implementation and review of
the NSP;

    - Providing an interface with the international development community for
the identification of Government security priorities under the NSP;

    - Continuous review and updating of the NSP and production of an annual
report.

### Specific Mechanisms 

4.7 Specific mechanisms to facilitate the effective functioning of the NSSIU will
include:

     - **Establishment of Joint Committees at the levels of:**
– Relevant Permanent Secretaries
– Heads of Departments and Agencies
– Relevant Local Government Authorities and Civil Society Groups
– Regional and International Partners

     - **Establishment of agreed standards, procedures and indicators of**
**progress.**

     - **Formalisation of written reporting systems, visits and consultations.**

     - **Special meetings** **with stakeholders.**

### Coordination of intelligence

4.8 **National Security Advisor (NSA) will in the immediate to short term, continue**
to oversee the establishment of the new National Strategic Intelligence Agency (NSIA).
Once the NSIA is established, a Director of the Agency will be appointed, who will also
coordinate the existing operational intelligence bodies through the use of agreed
protocols. The Director of the NSIA will report to the NSA and the NSC and ultimately
to the Prime Minister.


-----

4.9 Over the medium term, the position of the NSA will be established at the
Cabinet Office as the head of the NSC permanent staff, which will succeed the NSSIU.
The NSA will provide progress reports on strategic security initiatives, advice on
current major national security developments, and on the impact of regional and
international security concerns for Jamaica. When the NSSIU is dissolved, the
permanent staff of the NSC will perform the key functions and roles. The NSA will
therefore continue to require a small-dedicated staff within the NSC Secretariat for this
purpose. The NSA would support and report to the NSC, with a strong day- to -day
reporting to the Prime Minister and Minister of National Security.

### Enhancing programmes to promote community safety and security

4.10 A policy framework for action on revitalising community security, social
inclusion and the social contract is to be approved by Government. The Development
Division (Cabinet Office) has the mandate to coordinate the initiatives and programmes,
which will fall within the ambit of social intervention, given the existence of an
adequately stable environment. In communities which pose high risk for the social
agencies of the State, the Ministry of National Security will use appropriate means to
provide a secure environment for the regular delivery/provision of essential  public
services such as policing, solid waste management, public lighting and sewage disposal.
When conditions for stability have been set, the Development Division will exercise its
mandate on the ground. The profile of the Development Division is to be enhanced and
additional resources provided.

4.11 Parish level and Community Safety and Security Groups, which have begun to be
established, are to be linked in a network extending across the island, community by
community. These volunteer groups will harness the inputs of community
representatives, businesses, youth, emergency services, service clubs, and the local
authorities. The Ministry of National Security will coordinate this social movement and
will embrace legitimate community- based organisations. MNS will, within available
resources, provide critical support to assist groups to achieve safety and security goals
agreed by the community and which are in harmony with the priorities of the NSP.

### The public’s involvement in implementing the NSP

4.12 In keeping with the initiative to develop a stronger partnership between citizens,
civil society and all Government organisations involved in delivering security services, it
is important for all members of the public to understand the critical role that they are
required to play in helping to make Jamaica a safe and more secure place. Generally,
public interpretation of policing tends to be narrowly confined to the role of the JCF.
There are other government bodies with enshrined law enforcement functions and powers
that when not effectively discharged lead to disorder and can ultimately foster criminal
activity, these agencies are to be held to stricter account for their law enforcement


-----

functions. Greater public involvement and commitment in supporting all aspects of law
enforcement activities is called for.

4.13 Public participation and partnerships with State agencies working to improve
safety and security requires a structured medium to work effectively. In every parish
there are significant stakeholders such as the Fire Brigade, the NWA, and Health Services
who along with the Police and the JDF play a critical role in public safety and security.
The related activities of these various bodies should be integrated through appropriate
service level agreements or Memorandum of Understanding. These bodies should have
mandatory meetings open to members of the public for citizens to voice their concerns,
give feedback on the performance of the police and other State agencies and more
importantly to allow citizens to question the police and other agencies.

4.14 The established parish and community groups should facilitate public forums to
provide opportunities for local policing issues to be identified and for citizens to help the
local police establish policing priorities. The body should also have an advisory,
monitoring and evaluating role on security and safety matters. In this way, the true
philosophy of community policing can be better served through strengthening of the
partnership between the JCF and the communities as set out the 2005-8 Corporate
Strategy. This type of partnership should lead to a broadening of police accountability
that is desirous since it provides a way for the police to become more directly responsive
to the citizens. It should, therefore, become easier to get public cooperation in dealing
with crime and disorder.

### Funding priorities

4.15 Security affects all areas of life in Jamaica and is in fact the number one priority
for consideration at this stage of Jamaica’s development. While it is recognised that there
are limited resources, security must be seen as the most urgent sector to which priority
must be given in providing financial and other resources by both the public and private
sector. When the security sector has responded to the various actions required of the
NSP, and the environment becomes safer and more stable, the strategic re-allocation of
financial resources consistent with the improving security environment can be done. A
more careful and efficient management of resources on the part of the security forces will
also result in major savings. Development of detailed security- related budgets is beyond
the scope of this policy document but MDAs are required to complete that exercise in
keeping with their security mandates.

4.16 Areas to receive immediate allocation include the Special Security Initiatives
already outlined, along with the provision of resources to continue the ongoing
modernisation of key security organisations and all elements of the Criminal Justice
System. This must include the establishment of a National Strategic Intelligence Agency,
the provision of modern forensic equipment and the maintenance of a viable capability to
provide for sustained, effective surveillance and monitoring of Jamaica’s maritime
borders.
