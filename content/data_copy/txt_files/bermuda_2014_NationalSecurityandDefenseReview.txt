Your Excellency,

**National Security and Defence Review Committee Final Report**
_Towards a More Secure Bermuda_

As Chairman of the National Security and Defence Review Committee, I have the
honour to forward to Your Excellency the Final Report of the Committee which was
appointed by Your Excellency on Wednesday, 22 May 2013.
� ���������������������������������������������������������������������������������
Bermuda’s national security needs, to assess the resources required to meet those needs
and to make recommendations on the structures and organization required.
It quickly became apparent to the Committee that its remit was, in many respects,
���������������������������������������������������������������������������������
a wide-ranging and comprehensive assessment of the Island’s security capabilities has
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
mandate.
In approaching its task, the Committee received volumes of information not only from
uniformed organizations such as the Bermuda Regiment, the Bermuda Police Service
and HM Customs, but also from a diverse and broad cross-section of the community with
a keen interest in and a passionate commitment to ensuring that Bermuda is well served
in all aspects of security.
The information gathered by the Committee emanated from written and/or oral
submissions from individuals and organizations. The Committee is indebted to all
who provided information for their willingness to share that information and for their
unreserved candour in doing so.
Many of the recommendations being proposed by the Committee will, of course,
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������
considers that this fact alone should not preclude consideration being given to these
recommendations.
The Committee commends to Your Excellency and to the Government of Bermuda

NATIONAL SECURITY AND DEFENCE REVIEW i

the recommendations in this Report in the sincere belief that these recommendations
provide a sound and secure platform upon which the security needs of Bermuda can be
properly and appropriately addressed for years to come.
In submitting its Report, the Committee wishes to record, with sadness, the sudden
death in early January 2014 of Mrs. Louise A. Jackson, OBE, JP. Mrs. Jackson was a
valued and enthusiastic Member of the Committee, someone who brought insight, energy,
passion, humour and a wealth of knowledge to the task at hand. Her commitment to
this review never wavered and her contributions to the shaping of the Final Report
will be a lasting memory for all of us who had the pleasure of knowing her and serving
with her.
Your Excellency, it has been both an honour and a privilege for me and my fellow
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������
and it is our hope that this Report will provide a practical platform from which
Bermuda’s security needs can be addressed appropriately.

Yours sincerely,

Leopold Nathaniel Mills II, CBE, LL.D, JP

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

#### Situation

This review undertaken by the National Security and Defence Review Committee (“the
Committee”) was to examine Bermuda’s national security and defence. Its purpose was to
act as a benchmark assessment of the current security measures in place against a wide
range of threats and to make recommendations on how these threats may be mitigated
or avoided.

#### National Defence and Internal Security

Bermuda is an isolated land mass and its small size underscores its vulnerability to
potential natural and man-made disasters. For those reasons, the Island is obliged to
try and ensure, so far as it is able to do so, that it has the resources and the strategies in
place to address and mitigate such security threats.

National and private sector contingency plans have been in existence for several years.
However, in light of an increase in terrorism, a rise in incidences of cybercrime, global
threats arising from other sources, the scourge of gun and drug importation and the
Island’s porous borders, inter alia, there is an urgent need for Bermuda to re-examine
the existing plans and strategies, to modernize them and to implement best practices for
addressing these threats. This review seeks to suggest and to recommend ways whereby
provisions for the peace, safety and security of the residents of Bermuda can be enhanced.

#### National Security Review Process

The Committee reviewed various natural and man-made threats that might affect the
Island with considerable notice, little notice or no notice at all. Some of the threats that
have the potential to impact the security and safety of Bermuda’s residents are:
�� end to conscription

�� illicit drugs/gang activity

�� cybercrime

�� rioting/civil disturbance/public order events

�� hurricanes and winter storms

�� ������������������������������������������������������������������������

The above list is by no means exhaustive and the mitigation of these and other potential
threats is addressed throughout the body of the Report.

The Committee deemed it appropriate to cover key emerging issues in the body of the
Report by theme (National Defence, Border Protection, Law and Public Order, Emergency
Measures and Public Safety, Acute Care and Public Health, Economic Security and

NATIONAL SECURITY AND DEFENCE REVIEW 1


-----

Environmental Security) and to list the stakeholders for each area as appropriate. A
table of organizations and reports that were reviewed is at Annexe D. Additionally, there
were recommendations that had cross agency concerns. These recommendations are
listed below.

#### Summary of Recommendations

Recurring Cross Agency Concerns

The following recommendations were commonly raised and cited as the top priorities
across several agencies:

_Review the post conscription role of the Bermuda Regiment._ It was recognized by various
presenters and the Committee that a post conscription Regiment must continue to have
the capability to provide support for agencies such as the Bermuda Police Service (BPS),
Department of Corrections and Bermuda Fire and Rescue Service (BFRS).

_Establish a National Intelligence Agency (exclusive of the Financial Intelligence Agency_
_which is separately legislated)._ Existing resources and public service personnel can
be used to create a multi-agency staffed National Intelligence Agency with the focus
of developing an integrated intelligence database, intelligence products and actionable
intelligence to improve investigative quality and services. The Agency’s mandate should
������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
organized criminal enterprises.

_Implement legislative and regulatory reform._ Legislative and regulatory reform is
required to facilitate modernized global standards of compliance and enforcement and
best practice in threat reduction, national security and public safety.

_Revise the EMO Mandate and Standing Instructions._ The structure and working practices
of the EMO must be revised and expanded to include greater emphasis on disaster
preparedness and to develop effective spontaneous reactions to emergencies other than
hurricanes that occur with almost no notice.

_Update the Emergency Powers Act 1963. The Emergency Powers Act 1963 must be_
updated to make it relevant to current and future national disaster, defence and security
planning and operations.

_������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������_
_(NDC)._ There was almost universal support by several agencies and presenters for the
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
and response under the leadership of the National Disaster Coordinator. The postholder
would become an established member of the Emergency Measures Organization (EMO).

_Adhere to international standards for vetting and hiring of all uniformed services. The_
Committee recognizes that inappropriate conduct across a minority of the uniformed

services (BPS, Department of Corrections, HM Customs, Department of Immigration
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
���������������������������������������������������������������������������������
that standards for vetting and hiring be reviewed and that, where possible, higher
international standards be implemented. The Committee further recommends that each
of the uniformed services adopts anti-corruption policies where they are not currently in
place.

_Develop and implement effective performance indicators. Some Government Departments_
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
effectiveness of their respective operations. However, performance indicators were either
unavailable for several other key Departments or agencies or were deemed to be otherwise
ineffective by the Committee.

_Review the responsibilities, budgets and resources of agencies. A review must be undertaken_
to determine the appropriate resources required for Departments and agencies in order
for them to be compliant with international requirements of security and to position
them so that they are able to achieve appropriate levels of public safety.

_Establish inter-departmental and inter-agency procedures and protocols. Both oral and_
written presentations often overlapped between various Departments and agencies,
thereby revealing the need for documented and approved inter-departmental and
inter-agency procedures, protocols or Memoranda of Understanding in order to address
problems successfully and to eliminate redundancy.

_“Disaster preparedness” public education campaigns are needed. There was consensus_
amongst presenters and, a view that is endorsed by the Committee, that Bermuda must
prepare best practice publications that cover all major natural and man-made disasters.
These briefs must be made available via all main broadcast, social media, electronically
and in print versions.

_Continue to implement the recommendations from the Bermuda Government Parliamentary_
_Joint Select Committee on the Causes of Violent Crime and Gun Violence in Bermuda.[ 1]_
The Report on the causes of violent crime and gun violence in Bermuda that was tabled in
Parliament in July 2011 contains several recommendations for mitigating gang activity
in Bermuda. It is critical that the recommendations contained in that Report continue to
be implemented as a matter of priority.

_Establish and coordinate a network of emergency relief centres across the Island. There_
was widespread support amongst a cross-section of stakeholders for PCATs to work
closely with medical service providers, local volunteer relief agencies and charities to
establish predetermined emergency relief centres across the Island, along with a network
of professionals and volunteers who can provide assistance to vulnerable persons who are
geographically isolated during or in the aftermath of an incident across the Island.

report to Parliament, July 2011.

NATIONAL SECURITY AND DEFENCE REVIEW 3


-----

_A national threat analysis must be conducted. A full threat analysis benchmarking_
Bermuda’s current threats must be conducted and updated periodically (i.e. every
ten years) in the event of an occurrence which may alter the standing of existing or
emerging threats.

#### National Defence

_Bermuda Regiment_
_Implement a phased approach to the abolition of conscription. The Bermuda Government_
has announced its intention to abolish conscription. However, certain less publicly visible
aspects of national defence, internal security and disaster relief currently provided by
the Regiment might not be easily transferrable to, or absorbed by, other Government
Departments or emergency services, either in part or as a whole.

The Committee recognizes the cost implications associated with the transition from a
volunteer force supplemented by conscription to an all-volunteer force. It is critical that
the transition from a volunteer force supplemented by conscription to an all-volunteer
force be carried out over a period of time that preserves those national defence, internal
security and disaster relief functions provided by the Regiment currently or in the future,
subject to this review.

_Change the mission and strategic role of the Bermuda Regiment. Given the announced_
plans to end conscription, the Regiment must refocus its role to make it more relevant to
the realities of today’s world and situation in Bermuda.

Border Protection

_HM Customs_
_Expand and update the HM Customs mandate to create a Customs and Border Protection_
_Agency with legislated responsibilities for all enforcement measures relating to the_
_movement of people and goods across borders. Having an effective Customs and Border_
Protection Agency is critical to Bermuda’s national security and to its reputation as a
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
and updated to give legislated responsibilities for enforcement measures relating to the
movement of people and goods across borders.

_Conduct a review of Bermuda’s border control and protection needs and take the required_
_steps to address the gaps as a matter of urgency. To ensure that Bermuda is compliant_
with international requirements relating to border control and protection, the gaps in
the current border control and protection regime need to be addressed as a matter of
priority. This process will require a comprehensive review of Bermuda’s border control
and protection requirements to determine the precise scope and provisions of the

4 GOVERNMENT OF BERMUDA


-----

legislative and operational framework required, along with the attendant manpower and
other resources.

_Enhance the current arrival screening processes. The procedures for screening passengers_
and goods arriving in Bermuda by private aircraft, yachts and other marine craft must
be enhanced to prevent illegal travel and to prevent contraband from entering Bermuda.

_Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)_
_Conduct a review for the establishment of a protective zone for the EEZ. There is a need_
to establish a zone around the Island for the protection of Bermuda’s valued marine
life, while at the same time providing an avenue for security forces to interdict illicit
offshore activities. Additionally, the establishment of a protective marine reserve must
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
research is required to determine the economic implications of a protective marine zone
around the Island. The inability for Bermuda to mine its marine resources within its own
EEZ in the future is a concern that must be mitigated.

_Expand the Regiment’s existing Boat Troop capability in an enforcement role to protect_
_the EEZ and improve internal security. Some transit through the EEZ consists of_
legitimate trans-Atlantic marine vessels, but there are vessels entering Bermuda’s EEZ
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
and enforcement capability also exists for Bermuda’s inshore area. The expansion of the
Regiment’s Boat Troop or other designated resources to work with a Customs and Border
���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
matters. The Committee notes in this regard that the Regiment currently has the ability
to operate effectively on inshore waters and could expand its equipment and expertise in
order to protect the Island offshore in those areas where most marine activity occurs and,
perhaps, ultimately throughout Bermuda’s EEZ.

_Department of Immigration_
_Develop appropriate departure screening processes and ensure that adequate information_
_can be made available to address the risks effectively. Bermuda must take measures to_
institute its own checks on departing passengers as part of the responsibilities of the
Customs and Border Protection Agency. To ensure that existing gaps in relation to
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
in place to ensure that relevant information is available and shared on a timely basis.
Ensuring that appropriate cross agency MOUs are in place and that there is cross agency
access to required databases are important in this regard.

_Develop appropriate mechanisms to monitor visitor lengths of stay in Bermuda._ The
Department of Immigration must develop appropriate mechanisms to monitor the length
of stay of visitors.

_Develop processes and procedures to address violation of Immigration policies. It is_
important to put in place effective processes to locate persons who overstay their allotted

NATIONAL SECURITY AND DEFENCE REVIEW 5

time on the Island and to address violations of Immigration policies using the resources
of the Department of Immigration and/or the proposed Customs and Border Protection
Agency,

_Department of Marine and Ports Services_
_Establish effective marine surveillance for the western portion of the Island. The eastern_
and central portions of Bermuda’s inshore waters are well covered by two radar
installations based in St. George’s and at Gibb’s Hill in Southampton respectively. More
effective marine coverage for the western end of the Island is needed.

_���������������������������������������������������������������_ The Government
should consider making it compulsory for all vessels travelling beyond the barrier reefs
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
(AIS).

_Department of Airport Operations_
_Increase the security of the LF Wade International Airport. Increased physical security of_
the operations, passenger terminals and perimeter of the LF Wade International Airport
is required.

#### Law and Public Order

_Bermuda Police Service (BPS)_
_Continue the implementation of the Report of Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary_
_(HMIC) and other strategic reports on BPS. The BPS is generally regarded in a positive light_
by the people of Bermuda who recognize and respect its primary role in the maintenance
of law and public order. The implementation of the HMIC Report and other strategic
reports, including the current anti-gang strategy and current operational policing plans,
must be continued.

_Reallocate the Police Marine Unit to another agency. The Marine Unit of the BPS is_
an area of BPS operations and resources that should be reallocated to another agency
or agencies, including the Regiment, as part of an overall strategy to improve border
protection, including the enforcement of marine laws and operational effectiveness.

_Reallocate the Court Liaison Unit. The Court Liaison Unit is another area of BPS_
operations that should be reallocated to another Government Department, the private
sector or a combination of both.

_Reallocate other non-core, non-law enforcement roles. Several other areas of BPS operations_
and resources, including but not limited to explosive ordnance disposal, search and rescue
diving, static guards and vehicle maintenance, should be reallocated to the Regiment or
another Government agency, the private sector or some combination thereof.

6 GOVERNMENT OF BERMUDA


-----

_Ensure the Island’s ongoing ability to respond to outbreaks of public disorder. It is_
imperative that the Island’s scaled response capabilities (currently BPS followed by
Regiment) be preserved.

_Establish a National Intelligence Agency (exclusive of the Financial Intelligence Agency_
_which is separately legislated). Existing resources and public service personnel can_
be used to create a multi-agency staffed National Intelligence Agency with the focus
of developing an integrated intelligence database, intelligence products and actionable
intelligence to improve investigative quality and services. The Agency’s mandate should
������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
organized criminal enterprises.

_Develop up-to-date criteria for identifying the island’s Key Points to be protected during_
_an internal security situation, a disaster contingency or recovery planning. The Regiment_
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
needs to continue and be expanded to other agencies as appropriate to include the wider
range of threats outlined in this Report.

_Register and license large public events. Large public events like outdoor concerts do_
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
risk to public safety and to those marshalling crowds. The requirement to register
large gatherings and to have effective risk mitigation measures in place prior to the
commencement of such events is vital.

_Establish a single emergency call and dispatch centre. The Island’s emergency services_
������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
operators. The establishment of a single emergency call centre and uniformed services
���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
and improve the situational awareness of separate services for incidents.

_Department of Corrections_
_Develop and implement required policies and procedures to improve correctional facilities’_
_security. There appears to be an ad hoc approach to security procedures within the_
Department of Corrections that cannot address the systemic security issues effectively,
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
drugs and other contraband into the facilities and ongoing gang rivalries and activity
within the facilities. This situation requires urgent improvement.

_Procure adequate equipment for the surveillance of the correctional facilities’ perimeters._
Additional surveillance equipment must be acquired in order to reduce contraband
entering the correctional facilities.

_Draft contingency plans for the emergency housing of inmates. Corrections authorities_
must draft appropriate contingency plans for the emergency relocation of inmates from
each of the correctional facilities for implementation and use as disaster circumstances
warrant.

NATIONAL SECURITY AND DEFENCE REVIEW 7

#### Emergency Measures and Public Safety

_Emergency Measures Organization (EMO)_
_Estab�����������������������������������������������_ The Committee strongly
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
the Island’s national disaster planning and recovery as well as the coordination of the
security services in this regard. The Committee recommends that the NDP be staffed
with appropriate personnel led by the National Disaster Coordinator (NDC), supported
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
Government. The NDC must be a member of the EMO and report directly to the Minister.

_Update the Emergency Powers Act 1963. The Committee recommends that the Emergency_
Powers Act 1963 be updated to make it relevant to current and future national disaster,
defence and security planning and operations. It is the Committee’s view that new
������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
for the authorities pre, during and post event and provide for planning, public order and
safety at large scale events.

_Update the EMO Mandate and Standing Instructions._ The structure and working
practices of the EMO must be revised and expanded to include greater emphasis on
disaster preparedness and to develop effective spontaneous reactions to emergencies
other than hurricanes which could occur with almost no notice.

_Review the EMO Executive and second tier structure. It is recommended that the EMO_
re-examine its Executive and second tier structure to ensure that all key agencies
(Department of Health, Bermuda Hospitals Board’s Mass Casualty Response Unit, etc.)
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
response.

_Establish Memoranda of Understanding with international agencies. There is a need to_
review and update existing Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) or to develop MOUs
with the relevant international bodies, including humanitarian agencies such as the Red
Cross, to ensure rapid response to critical incidents impacting both the local population
and foreign nationals.

_Make provision for the special needs of seniors and vulnerable persons. Bermuda has_
a sizeable population of persons aged 65 and older, many of whom experience varying
levels of health and mobility. Special consideration must be given to the needs and care
for this segment of the population in the event of a national emergency or major critical
incident impacting the Island.

_Develop up-to-date criteria for identifying the island’s Key Points to be protected during_
_an internal security situation, a disaster contingency or recovery planning. The Regiment_
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
needs to continue and be expanded to other agencies as appropriate to include the wider
range of threats outlined in this Report.

-----

_Disaster preparedness information must be updated and public education campaigns_
_implemented. There was consensus amongst presenters and, a view that was endorsed_
by the Committee, that Bermuda must prepare best practice publications that cover all
major natural and man-made disasters. These briefs must be made available via all main
broadcast, social media, electronically and in print versions.

_Networks of emergency relief centres must be established. There was widespread support_
amongst a cross-section of stakeholders for PCATs to work closely with medical service
providers, local volunteer relief agencies and charities to establish predetermined
emergency relief centres across the Island.

_Establish a contingency plan for handling mass casualties. The Committee was made_
aware that mass casualty training was undertaken by the KEMH team in conjunction
with other agencies under full live exercise conditions. The Committee was less persuaded
that the Island was equipped to deal with a very large-scale mass casualty event with
casualties numbering in the hundreds. Appropriate contingency plans and/or MOUs with
external agencies should be seriously considered. In addition, no contingency plan exists
for the provision of life-saving medical supplies in outlying areas in the event that roads
are impassable for vehicles. Relevant contingency plans must be established.

_Improve communications with other emergency organizations. Include KEMH personnel_
in EMO and disaster planning drills. KEMH must be kept abreast of any 911 calls where
the incident has the potential to require medical assistance. Currently, KEMH is not
included in some emergency planning and is caught off guard at times when there are
spikes in emergency registrations caused by incidents about which it has received no
notice.

_Bermuda Fire and Rescue Service (BFRS)_
_Implement the recommendations of the Sir Ken Knight 2010 Bermuda Fire Service Report_
_������������������������������������������������ The BFRS received two independent_
reports on its capabilities and shortcomings in 2010. The BFRS should implement the
recommendations of the Sir Ken Knight Report and also address the shortfalls outlined
in the ARFF Audit Report 2010 which provided an in-depth review of the capabilities of
the BRFS LF Wade International Airport Division.

_Address the ongoing personnel shortages within the BFRS. The lack of available manpower_
was pointed out in each of the above-mentioned reports. The Committee understands
that manpower shortage issues have been an ongoing challenge for the BFRS.

_�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������_
The Committee recommends that the BFRS review the resources that it would require
in the event of a serious incident aboard one of the mega cruise ships that make weekly
stops in Bermuda between April and October each year. The BFRS also must conduct a
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
multi-storey buildings that now exceed its current capabilities.

_Department of Works and Engineering_
_Enhance security at reservoirs. Recognizing the risks associated with contamination of_
the reservoirs, the Committee recommends that immediate attention be given to securing

_Provide for training of additional operators of water plants. The Committee, recognizing_
that the Island’s water plants were not automated and that the normal operators might
be prevented from reaching the facilities during a major hurricane, for example, agrees
that Regiment and/or other emergency services’ personnel should be trained to operate
the plants on a stand-by basis.

_Ensure availability of cement supplies during times of disaster. The Committee_
recommends that Government pursue a formal agreement with the owners of the Island’s
sole cement-producing facility that would ensure the immediate availability of concrete
supplies should they be required following a hurricane or major disaster.

_Ensure protection of persons who live on coastline or in other low-lying areas of Island._
The Committee noted the risks faced during hurricanes by persons who lived close to
the coastline or in other low-lying areas of the Island. The Committee agrees that every
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
would provide up-to-date data on risks associated with living in such areas during times
of tidal surge. The Committee believes that such data would greatly assist the authorities
in ensuring the safety of residents in these areas.

_Department of Parks_
_Ensure availability of equipment and vehicles during times of disaster. The Committee_
expressed concern that the unavailability of equipment and vehicles as they awaited
repairs or replacement could militate against the Department’s ability to respond as
required during post-disaster clean-up exercises. The Committee recommends that every

Steps must be taken to address these challenges.

_Develop appropriate legislation to mitigate telecommunications fraud. One of the topics_
raised by telecommunications service providers and the business community was the
growing concern with telecommunications fraud and the negative effect it can have on
businesses domiciled in Bermuda. The required legislative reform must be progressed.

#### Environmental Security

_Establish alternative energy sources. Bermuda must promote the continued use of_
alternative sources of renewable energy, such as solar, wave and wind power, for both
business and individual households, in order to diversify the sources of energy for the
Island.

_Diversify the current single generating capability across multiple locations. Bermuda_

protection of incentives to encourage the full utilization of arable farmland.

_Develop a plan for emergency food distribution. Contingency plans must be developed_
with food importers and retailers for the sourcing and disbursement of emergency food
supplies, if needed, in the event of a sustained interruption of food imports to the Island
resulting from a local or international disaster.

_Bermuda Weather Service_
_Establish a National Weather Service. Bermuda Weather Service is a private entity and_
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
weather service since the closure of the US base in 1995. The Committee believes that
there is considerable merit in creating such a service and it urges that a feasibility study
be undertaken as a matter of priority.

_Install a backup Doppler Radar System. BWS has an ageing system that has been_
affected by the humid and salty atmosphere and is thus subject to breakdowns. Repairs
can take weeks, a timeline which impacts the ability to provide critical predictions. A less
expensive back-up system should be installed as soon as is possible.

_Establish an Early Alert System (EAS).[2] There is need for further research into the_

in conjunction with any emergency response to prepare the Island for an approaching
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
that the Island was not currently well served in terms of warnings for unexpected severe
weather or a disaster that could occur at almost no notice.

#### The Way Forward

The Committee does not presume to answer all questions that emerged during oral
presentations and in written submissions. However, the Report highlights the key issues
������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
if left unchecked, could have an extremely serious and negative impact on the Island’s
safety, security and prosperity.

2EAS is the term that the International Early Warning Programme coordinated by the United Nations uses for all systems that are used to send emergency population warnings. EAS is often activated when an unpredicted emergency such as a
tsunami, tornado, earthquake, or other natural disasters occur. The vast majority of EAS alerts are generated by the National
Weather Service. Source: Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

security has broadened to include:

�� ������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
and social order.

�� Economic security — in today’s complex global environment, economic security
encompasses international trade and other multi-national agreements, the
availability of natural resources and the freedom to exercise choice in policies
to develop a country’s economy for the creation and protection of national and
personal wealth.

in Bermuda’s Constitution, but the following ‘special responsibilities’ of the appointed
Governor are referred to in Section 62 (1) of the Constitution: external affairs, defence,
including the armed forces, internal security and the police. The Constitution makes no
provision for there to be a ‘National Security Minister’. At various times, the Government
has chosen to appoint, for example, a Minister of Labour, Home Affairs and Public Safety
who has been assigned responsibility for national security or a Minister of National
Security, as is the case currently.

For the purposes of this Report, the concept of national security is wide reaching. It
encompasses defence, armed forces, internal security, police, social, economic and
environmental security and public safety. It includes also preparation for natural disasters
and other catastrophic events that have the potential to cause severe environmental,
economic, health and safety dangers to the citizens of a country.

This Report addresses, in particular:

�� natural and man-made disasters

�� public health and safety

�� internal security and public order

�� border protection

�� subsistence provisions for residents

�� security of seniors and vulnerable persons

�� local and international crime, including money laundering and fraud

business jurisdiction resulting from weaknesses in response capabilities to threats
(real or perceived) in these areas.

### Mission of Committee

This review by the National Security and Defence Review Committee (“the Committee”)
was undertaken to examine Bermuda’s national security and defence. Its aim is to act
as a benchmark assessment of the current security measures in place against a wide
range of threats and to make recommendations on how these risks may be mitigated and
overcome.

#### National Security and Defence Review Committee Terms of Reference

The Committee was established in May 2013[3] by His Excellency the Governor, Mr. George
Fergusson, and the Hon. Michael H. Dunkley, JP, MP, then Minister of Public Safety, to:

1. Undertake a review of Bermuda’s national security needs;
2. Assess the resources required to meet these needs; and
3. Make recommendations on the structures, resources and organizations
required.
The Committee’s Terms of Reference set by His Excellency the Governor are at
Annexe A. The Committee Members and their biographies are at Annexe B.

#### Purpose

The review established by His Excellency the Governor is designed to identify the areas
in which Bermuda must enhance its capability to protect the security and safety of the
public. The review takes into account the maintenance of law and order, protection in
relation to natural and man-made hazards, current technological advances with regard
to the protection of borders and Key Points, the possibility of transport accidents on
land, sea and in the air and the mitigation and management of other risks that might
result in mass casualty. The review takes into consideration, inter alia, current and
potential future roles of the EMO, uniformed services, other Government Departments
and agencies and some private sector entities in the context of national defence, security
and safety.

The review also includes consideration of previous reviews, policies and other documents
drafted for various agencies as well as updated submissions from public agencies, key
stakeholders and members of the general public. It is hoped that information shared
and conclusions drawn during the review process will serve to formulate a cohesive
and comprehensive national policy that encompasses all relevant stakeholders and is

#### Background

Over the past 35 years or so, the Bermuda Government has commissioned numerous
landmark reports on social issues and various aspects of national security that have
the potential to impact Bermuda’s political/social stability and its reputation as a
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
comprehensively the security and physical safety of the people of Bermuda.

During the consultation process, the Committee learned of the existence of an incomplete
National Security Plan drafted in 2008[4]����������������������������������������������
consultative remit accompanying the current review and was not presented to Cabinet
at the time for action.

### Global Perspective

_National security approaches for the British Overseas Territories: Turks and Caicos_
_Islands, Falkland Islands, Cayman Islands, Anguilla, Gibraltar and Bermuda and how_
_these compare to the larger countries of Canada and Australia._

The events of 11 September 2001 (known as 9/11) created a need for countries to
���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
all increasingly dependent on each other for that security. The forces of globalization,
including the development of technology and the general scale of environment-impacting
human activity on our planet, reinforce the importance of reviewing and developing a
coherent national security policy in Bermuda. Many other Overseas Territories have
come to a similar conclusion since 9/11; consequently, border security and disaster
management in British Overseas Territories have improved greatly since that fateful
day. This has been especially true in Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and Gibraltar. The
following is a review of disaster planning and national security approaches and policies
for British Overseas Territories that are similar to Bermuda, with common internal and
external threats.

the jurisdictions’ abilities to manage the vast array of risks relating to the security and
safety of the respective jurisdictions. The Committee’s Report will address the physical,
environmental and internal security of Bermuda, seniors’ needs and the Island’s health
provisions.

Anguilla Hurricane, Flooding
Cayman Islands Hurricane, Earthquake, Flooding, Cruise Ship Incident
Falkland Islands Cruise Ship Incident, Risks to Shipping
Gibraltar Transport Incidents, Civil Contingencies
Turks and Caicos Islands Hurricane, Flooding, Cruise Ship Incident

#### Disaster Management

The Overseas Territories listed in this jurisdictional review prepared for the purposes
of this Report now have at least a draft National Disaster Plan that responds to their
main risk events. Many now have dedicated disaster management agencies, similar to
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
of weakness, as most Territories’ plans do not yet cover all elements of the disaster
management cycle of preparedness, mitigation, response and recovery. Additionally,
some local legislation and policies lag behind good practice. This is true even for Bermuda.

It would appear that the reason for this lag in good practice is that the Territories have
not based their plans on a clear disaster management policy which includes how they
ensure that their communities are ready for the next disaster and their measurement
of effectiveness. There is also a lack of up-to-date local legislation equivalent to the UK
Civil Contingencies Act 2004 which establishes clear roles and responsibilities for those
involved in emergency preparation and response and puts in place emergency powers

#### Border Security and External Threats

The increase in border security in the jurisdictions reviewed in this Report has been
the result of not only concerns that arose from 9/11, but also from increasing illegal
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
waters.

Compliance with international and US standards for border security, airport security
and marine and port security has been a condition for Bermuda to maintain its US

The FCO, the UK Department for international Development (DFiD) and the UK
Department of Transport (DOT) have been charged with helping the Overseas Territories
to raise their aviation and maritime safety standards and ensure they are internationally

of Anguilla, have raised their standards and are compliant. However, there are still areas
�������������������������������������������������������������������

#### Comparison of approaches to National Security with Canada and Australia post 9/11

Following the 9/11 attacks, many countries, including the Overseas Territories, Canada
and Australia, implemented sweeping changes to national security legislation and
policy. Prior to 9/11, Canada and Australia looked at national security from different
perspectives, Canada from a more human security[7] perspective and Australia from a
more regional security perspective.

Since 9/11, both Canada and Australia implemented national security legislation, policy
and infrastructure that provide better coordination of foreign and defence policies,
immigration and crime legislation in the emerging broader security environment.

Both countries focused on six strategic areas as the core elements of their national
security interests:

�� intelligence

�� emergency planning and management

�� transport security

�� border security

�� international security

�� public health

This jurisdictional review assisted the Committee’s work and in the consideration and
preparation of this Report, the Committee has largely followed the strategic areas
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
legislative structure.

The evolution of the many and varying strategies whereby national security throughout
the post-9/11 period might be enhanced highlights the complexity and challenges that
all countries face in this new and complex security environment. The events of 9/11 are
stark reminders that security is the number one social service that governments must
provide to their people.

### Bermuda Country Profile Analysis (PESTLE Analysis)

���������������������������������������������������������������������������������
Economic, Sociological, Technological, Legal and Environmental) analysis technique.[8]
This audit examined Bermuda’s infrastructure and its resident population in order to
assist in understanding its ability to deal with a range of national crises. The PESTLE
analysis served to identify the range of threats to be considered and the potential impact
������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
with whom consultation was required during the review process. Key points from the
evaluation are summarized below to assist with contextualizing the issues referred to in
this Report.

��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
in the face of potential crises or major changes, taking into consideration the macro
and meso circumstances that impact the entity. In the context of Bermuda, macro
circumstances can include size, climate, geographical location, political dependency,
global economic circumstances, etc. that potentially impact the security or well-being
of the population, but over which there is no degree of control. Meso circumstances can
include the country’s internal social, political, legal and economic framework and other
decision-making processes over which there is some degree of control. By understanding
both the macro factors (what we cannot control) and meso factors (what we can control), it
is possible to provide an analytical framework to contextualize issues raised with respect
to Bermuda’s security and defence and to identify ways whereby opportunities might be
maximized and threats mitigated.

Consideration of the factors contained in the PESTLE analysis is essential when a
���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
possible solutions without this vital context greatly reduces the possibility of maximizing
opportunities and minimizing threats. It must also be recognized that there are some
circumstances that make an impact over which there is some degree of control and some
circumstances which make an impact, but which cannot be controlled.

#### Political Overview

The PESTLE political analysis for Bermuda includes an explanation of the country’s
Overseas Territory dependency status, Constitution, political framework, international
associations and international relations. It also includes an overview of its internal
security and national defence mechanisms.

#### Economic Overview

The PESTLE economic analysis for Bermuda includes an overview of its GDP, currency
and economic conditions, revenue sources, aspects of its internal and external trade and
its transport infrastructure.

### Consultative Methodology

The establishment of the Committee and its mandate were widely advertised. Many
organizations and members of the public met with the Committee to discuss matters
pertaining to critical incidents involving natural or man-made disasters, various
stakeholder response capabilities to these contingencies, perceived risks to these responses
and recommended measures to mitigate these risks. In addition, the Committee invited
written submissions from members of the public.

The Committee met with 85 presenters and reviewed in excess of 90 pertinent written
submissions and 20 ancillary and background reports during the course of the review. A
table cataloguing all presenters and submissions is at Annexe D.

#### Soft Systems Methodology (SSM)

The Soft Systems Methodology (SSM)[10] approach was used to gather, store and
analyze information presented to the Committee during its consultative phase. SSM
is a qualitative framework that provides a systemic approach for tackling real-world

identify potential threats and various stakeholders’ ability to respond to them. These
threats, or emerging issues, were then further analyzed through SWOT and Gap Analysis
in order to consider viable options, draw conclusions and make recommendations where
appropriate.

While the strength of the written submissions was generally of a very high standard
and factually correct, the Committee gained the most illuminating source of information
during oral presentations. The Committee concluded that many presenters were far
more comfortable discussing the real issues than committing their concerns to paper.
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������
shared by the vast majority of presentations was corroborated by other conversations or
communications with relevant parties, so the integrity of the information gathered was
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
not attributed in the Report.

It was the Committee’s view that its composition, a unique blend of members’ specialties,
backgrounds and experiences, played a key role in encouraging the presenters to share
their views willingly, candidly and frankly. The myriad skills and experience sets offered
������������������������������������������������������������ concerns and the need to
pursue relevant lines of enquiry with other agencies.

### Threat Analysis Methodology

#### Risk Matrix

A threat analysis for Bermuda was included in the draft National Security Plan that
was produced by the Department of Defence in 2008. However, as that plan did not
���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
by Cabinet, the threat analysis contained in that report cannot be cited as a reliable
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
particularly with respect to the economic downturn and advances in technology.

The Committee therefore deemed it reasonable to anticipate that new threats had
emerged since completion of the 2008 draft plan. The Committee catalogued all threats
that had been raised during the review process and conferred with the heads of the
BPS, the Bermuda Regiment, the Bermuda Fire and Rescue Service, King Edward VII
Memorial Hospital and the Bermuda Weather Service on the potential impact of these
risks. While this was a somewhat subjective exercise, it is considered by the Committee
to be at the very least a useful reference point from which to debate the threats and to
assess the status of the Island’s security and safety.

NATIONAL SECURITY AND DEFENCE REVIEW 23


-----

Some of factors that have the potential to impact the security and safety of Bermuda’s
residents are:

�� _End to Conscription. Many persons in the community, some current and former_
members of the Bermuda Regiment in particular, believe that the end to conscription
will have a deleterious impact upon Bermuda’s political and social stability. They
fear that abolition of conscription will result in the Island’s diminished ability
to maintain public law and order or to respond to public disorder. Critics of the
proposal to end conscription also argue that the decision will impact negatively on
the Island’s pre- and post-emergency response capabilities during times of natural
disaster or other major critical incidents.

�� _Illicit Drugs/Gangs Activity. Illicit drugs importation and usage which fuel much_
of Bermuda’s crime place a huge demand on Government’s resources in terms
of budgetary and human resources allocations, in the areas of law enforcement,
social services, public health, education, border protection and the judicial system
in particular. These budgetary and human resources allocations are essential as
the Island seeks to mitigate the negative impact of illicit drugs activity on its social
and economic stability and its reputation as a safe jurisdiction for residents and
visitors. These demands, combined with current economic challenges, will present

�� _Cybercrime. ���������������������������������������������������������������������_

security of any country. Unauthorized access to governmental or nongovernmental
infrastructures can create a serious threat and have a negative impact on a
country’s political, economic and military security. This is especially important in

�� _Rioting/Civil Disturbance/Public Order Events._ High unemployment coupled
with other social and economic problems within the community can impact the

produces additional strain on Bermuda’s overstretched uniformed services.
Given Bermuda’s GDP and its need to maintain its reputation as a socially and
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������
threat to Bermuda’s future sustainability.

�� _Hurricanes and Winter Storms._ Hurricanes and tropical storms have had an
impact on Bermuda from its earliest times. The initial colonization of Bermuda
was a direct result of the 1609 hurricane in which the Sea Venture, an English
ship bound for Jamestown, Virginia, ran aground here. A study of local records
of storm damage from 1609 to the present day indicates the occurrence of a very
severe storm, one resulting in major damage to property and vegetation, once

every six to seven years.[11] The Island has been fortunate in that major injury
and loss of life have been relatively rare and the Island through the centuries
has demonstrated its ability to recover relatively quickly from the impact of
these occurrences. However, hurricanes and hybrid storms (i.e. hurricanes
with tornadoes) have the potential to destroy food crops and other vegetation,
to destroy homes and shelters and other structures and to disrupt services and
other resources that are critical to Bermuda’s ability to function as a socially and

of its residents and visitors and protection of industrial and residential premises.

The above list is by no means exhaustive and the mitigation of these and other potential
threats such as health pandemics, severe weather, major accidents and other catastrophic
events are addressed in other areas of this Report.

#### Committee Recommendation

_Conduct a full threat analysis. Notwithstanding the informal analysis undertaken by_
the Committee and for the sake of clarity and completeness, it would be useful for the
Government to conduct a full threat analysis, benchmark Bermuda’s current risks and to
update it periodically (i.e. every ten years) in the event of an occurrence which may alter
the standing of these existing or emerging risks.

### Emerging Issues

��������������������������������������������������������������������������������
deliberations crossed numerous agencies. The Committee therefore deemed it
appropriate to cover the key recurring issues in the body of the Report by theme
and to list the stakeholders for each area as appropriate. In order to do justice to
the remaining security issues at both the organizational and tactical levels, detailed

reports for respective agencies were compiled. A table of organizations and reports
that were reviewed is at Annexe D.

#### Recurring Cross Agency Concerns

The following recurring themes were expressed in written and oral submissions by
several presenters and agencies:

1. Review the role of the Regiment post conscription. It has been recognized that the
Regiment post conscription must continue to have the capability to provide support
for agencies such as the BPS, Department of Corrections and the BFRS.

_2. Establish a National Intelligence Agency (exclusive of the Financial Intelligence Agency_
_which is separately legislated). Existing resources and public service personnel can be_
used to create a multi-agency staffed National Intelligence Agency with the focus of
developing an integrated intelligence database, intelligence products and actionable
intelligence to improve investigative quality and services. The Agency’s mandate
���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
and organized criminal enterprises.

The Committee heard from several presenters, including the BPS, that there was
a highly disjointed approach taken to intelligence gathering, dissemination and
investigative actioning at the national level. The BPS has a robust intelligence
infrastructure within its Intelligence and Tasking Division. Other agencies, such as
HM Customs, Immigration and Corrections, have their own intelligence infrastructure,
personnel and procedures of varying effectiveness. The Committee was told that critical
������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
such, simply because of a lack of trust among some agency personnel. The result of
���������������������������������������������������������������������������������
it is altogether unacceptable that an island as small as Bermuda should have an
ineffective intelligence regime.

4. _Institute legislative and regulatory reform in the area of National Security. Legislative_
and regulatory review and reform are required to facilitate modernized global
standards of compliance and enforcement and best practice in risk reduction, public
safety and national security.

5. _Revise the current EMO Mandate and Standing Instructions. The structure and_
working practices of the EMO must be revised and expanded to include greater
emphasis on disaster preparedness and to develop effective spontaneous reactions to
emergencies other than hurricanes that occur with almost no notice. This inclusion of
subject matter experts such as KEMH and Bermuda Weather Service staff in planning
and events is necessary, especially at the early stages of the event.

6. _Update the Emergency Powers Act 1963._ The Committee recommends that the
Emergency Powers Act 1963 be updated to make it relevant to current and future

7. _������������������������������������������������������������������������������_
_Coordinator (NDC)._ There was almost universal support for the establishment of
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
which would be empowered to coordinate and direct the efforts of Government
Departments and external agencies in disaster preparedness, planning and in the
provision of post disaster relief. The work of the NDP, headed by the NDC, would
include building strategic responses and planning across a wide variety of potential

NGOs are involved in the planning and strategy development. The NDC would then
be responsible for ensuring that the Island has a plan of response for each of a wide
variety of possible threats. This recommendation is consistent with the Committee
reviews of numerous overseas jurisdictions which have established security councils
in recent years in response to changing global threats.

8. _Adhere to international standards for vetting and hiring of all uniformed services._
The Committee recognizes that perceived inappropriate conduct across the uniformed
services (BPS, Department of Corrections, HM Customs, Department of Immigration

performance indicators to measure effectiveness of their respective operations.
However, performance indicators were either unavailable for several other key
agencies or Departments or deemed by the Committee to be otherwise ineffective.
The Committee recommends that performance indicators be implemented across all
Government entities that are subject to this Report (where they do not exist or are
deemed ineffective).

safety and security in areas of training, facilities and equipment, thereby undermining
Bermuda’s national security and the safety of its residents. Reviews must be
undertaken to determine the appropriate resources required for these agencies to
be compliant with international requirements of security and to achieve appropriate
levels of public safety.

11. There is widespread absence of inter-departmental and inter-agency procedures and
_protocols. The Committee saw numerous instances of Government Departments and_

NATIONAL SECURITY AND DEFENCE REVIEW 27


-----

other agencies operating in strict silos with very little sideways communication or
collaboration. Presentations, both oral and written, often crossed boundaries with
other Departments/agencies and revealed the need for input from other agencies if the
desired outcomes were to be achieved. It was clear that problems often arose as a result
of the absence of documented approved/established inter-departmental procedures,
protocols or MOUs, with individuals relying on their colleagues’ personality, goodwill
and cooperation in order to address problems successfully.

12. “Disaster preparedness” public education campaigns are needed. There was consensus
amongst presenters and, a view that is endorsed by the Committee, that Bermuda
must prepare best practice publications that cover all major natural and man-made
disasters. These briefs must be made available via all main broadcast, social media,
electronically and in print versions.

13. Continue to implement the recommendations from the Bermuda Government
_Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on the Causes of Violent Crime and Gun Violence_
_in Bermuda.[ 12] The Report on the causes of violent crime and gun violence in Bermuda_
that was tabled in Parliament in July 2011 contains several recommendations for
mitigating gang activity in Bermuda. It is critical that the recommendations contained
in this Report be implemented as a matter of priority. Gang rivalries cause managers
���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
productivity, additional fuel and transport costs and a reduction in morale of those
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
in gainful employment from moving freely around the Island for fear of attack by gang
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������
gang activity outside of the prison.

14. Establish and coordinate a network of emergency relief centres across the Island. There
was widespread support amongst a cross-section of stakeholders for PCATs to work
closely with medical service providers, local volunteer relief agencies and charities
to establish predetermined emergency relief centres across the Island along with a
network of professionals and volunteers who can provide assistance to vulnerable
persons who are geographically isolated during or in the aftermath of an incident
������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
or ailments should also be available in these centres to reduce unnecessary strain on
the Island’s medical services or acute care facilities during or in the aftermath of a
disaster.

15. Conduct full risk analysis of Bermuda. Bermuda has not had a full risk analysis
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
informal analysis that was undertaken for the purpose of this review, the Committee
recommends that the Government conduct a full threat analysis that would benchmark

### National Defence

#### Bermuda Regiment

The Bermuda Government has announced its intention to abolish conscription. However,
certain less publicly visible aspects of national defence, internal security and disaster
relief currently provided by the Regiment might not be easily transferrable to, or
absorbed by, other emergency services or Government Departments, either in part or as
a whole. It was noted by the Committee that a number of other stakeholders interviewed
as part of this review, most notably the BPS, the Bermuda Fire and Rescue Service
������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
their respective contingency plans without which their own operational effectiveness and
capabilities would be, in their estimation, substantially diminished.

Many international businesses operating in Bermuda have repeatedly expressed the
view that the overall security of the Island, provided by the BPS and supplemented by
the Regiment, is a critical success factor for Bermuda. Any action that has the potential
to compromise that security, or indeed give the perception of compromising it, must be
carefully considered. Therefore, it is of critical importance that the Regiment’s transition
from a volunteer force supplemented by conscription to an all-volunteer force be conducted
over a time frame that preserves those national defence, internal security and disaster
relief aspects provided by the Regiment currently or in the future, subject to this review.

_Key Organizational Objectives or Main Effort_

Pursuant to Section 32 of the Defence Act 1965, the Governor may direct that the
Regiment or any part of the Regiment be embodied if it appears to him to be necessary to
do so in the interests of public safety or the defence of Bermuda.

During times of austerity, it is vital for Government to be seen to spend taxpayers’ funds
���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
knowledge and awareness of the Regiment’s current responsibilities, mission and role
are not widely known by the community at large. There exists a public misperception
that the Regiment’s most visible/sole role is ceremonial and therefore not cost-effective.

The Regiment’s main responsibilities are to support and provide assistance to the
Regimental Assistance to the Civil Authority (RACA) (which includes security of
Bermuda, its people, property, livelihood and interests) in order to maintain normality
through the following:

1. Regimental Assistance to the Civil Ministries (RACM)

�� Crisis beyond their immediate control

�� Natural disasters (hurricanes)

32 GOVERNMENT OF BERMUDA


-----

�� Man-made catastrophes (plane crashes and oil spills)

�� Non-crisis maritime support to the BPS, Customs and Fisheries

�� Medical support to BFRS EMTs

�� ��������������������������������������������������������������������������
or state occasions

2. Regimental Assistance to the Civil Power (RACP)

�� Protection for the Key Points

�� Internal Security Operations in support of the BPS (crowd control)

3. Regimental Assistance to Bermudian Society (RABS)

�� Integration and development of Bermudians through provision of a common
military experience

�� Opportunities to enhance life skills

�� Discipline

�� Mould better citizens and make Bermuda a better country through developing
skills to support and respect civil authority and society

4. Regimental Assistance to the International Community (RAIC)

�� Instructions and training

�� Internal security support

�� Disaster relief efforts

The Bermuda Regiment has been embodied in support of the BPS on numerous public
order occasions including the strike and Belco riots in 1965; various riots and states
of emergency in 1970, 1972 and 1977; the assassination of the Police Commissioner in
1972, and the assassination of His Excellency the Governor and his ADC in 1973 and the
general strike in 1981. The Regiment has further assisted the BPS and Government in
providing key security capability during the Anglo-American Summits held on the Island
during the 1990s; the visits of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II to Bermuda in 1953, 1975,
1983, 1994 and 2009; the Tall Ships Race in 2000 and the US terror attacks in 2001.
The Regiment has been embodied for every major hurricane that has struck the Island
in recent years, has assisted the BPS with joint maritime patrolling since 2010 and has
������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
members of the Regiment assisted with disaster relief to the Cayman Islands in 2004,
Grenada in 2005 and the Turks and Caicos Islands in 2008. The Regiment also provided
internal security during the Cricket World Cup held in the West Indies in 2007.

one Quartermasters and one Band) and 650 personnel, the Regiment currently has a
manned/operational strength of 409 personnel, of which only 28 are currently full-time
staff providing mostly senior command, training and administrative roles. The full-time
staff includes three secondments to other Government Departments (Aide-de-Camp to
the Governor and two diplomatic drivers).

The current (2013/2014) budget for the Regiment totals $6.9 million, an amount which
������������������������������������������������������������������

Of the current funding, approximately $3.0 million is attributable solely to the training,
��������������������������������������������������������������������

The remainder of the Regiment’s current funding is spent on training and operating costs,
with very little apparent long term investment in either equipment or infrastructure
possible.

_Abolition of Conscription_
The Committee analyzed various potential impacts and resulting contingent liabilities
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
to abolish conscription in Bermuda, such intention communicated in the Speech from the
Throne delivered by His Excellency the Governor in November 2013.[13]

Section 4 of the Defence Act 1965 states: “The Regiment shall be raised and maintained
by means of voluntary enlistment, and also, in case voluntary enlistment proves
inadequate for the raising or maintenance of the Regiment, by means of compulsory
military service”. In Bermuda, “compulsory military service” is more commonly referred
to as “conscription”.

The legislated intent since 1965 has therefore always been for the Regiment to be a
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
for the Regiment to accomplish its required responsibilities with respect to RACA.

While it is intended that the Committee’s review and its resulting Report will assist
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
the needs of Bermuda and the future of the Regiment rest solely with Government.

In this context, the Committee considered the following matters, among others:

�� The Regiment’s requirements in order for it to continue to perform the roles and
the responsibilities it currently undertakes with respect to RACA, assuming that
they are not amended or diminished, notwithstanding the proposed abolition of
conscription;

�� The impact to Bermuda in terms of its security and the safety of the public should
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
and responsibilities it currently undertakes;

�� The ways in which the Regiment’s existing roles and responsibilities with respect
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
increased volunteerism;

�� A universal model of national service as an alternative to volunteerism and
conscription; and

�� Retention of the current Regiment model, or a variant thereof, mindful of the
Committee’s other recommendations and within which conscription remains a
component as currently legislated.

_Option 1: Transition to All-Volunteer with No Other Changes_
The Defence Act 1965 currently provides for conscription should there not be enough
volunteers to support the Regiment’s current responsibilities. Should the Regiment’s
current responsibilities not be amended or diminished, then upon the abolition of
conscription the Regiment will be required to meet its mandate to RACA solely through
volunteerism.

The Committee notes, as have various other interviewed stakeholders, that the
Regiment’s ability to provide a surge of disciplined and well-marshalled human resources
is the key component to several other emergency services’ and Government Departments’
respective contingency plans. This capability is required to provide physical security in
terms of internal security and disaster relief.

The importance of the Regiment to the BPS during public order events in the absence of
any other similarly uniformed service was made abundantly clear by the Commissioner
of Police during his presentation to the Committee. The Committee noted that a viable
risk facing Bermuda and the BPS, although one that the Committee and BPS hoped
never to materialize, was the level of spontaneous and senseless violence, damage and
destruction that erupted in London and other key cities in the United Kingdom in 2011.
The United Kingdom was able to cope during that time of crisis by mobilizing police forces
in surrounding counties by virtue of established mutual aid agreements such as Thames
Valley Police and Avon & Somerset Constabulary to augment the various city forces,
with the Territorial Army as an ultimate reserve. Should Bermuda experience a similar
drastic and immediate escalation of violence, the BPS’s ability to deploy Public Support

throughout the Regiment’s 50-year history.

�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������

1. _Manpower Requirements. In order to provide RACA effectively to the degree_
currently mandated, the need to maintain the Regiment’s manpower at a set
minimum has been previously well-established by several other Committees and

NATIONAL SECURITY AND DEFENCE REVIEW 35


-----

reviews, both internal and external, submitted to Government during the past 35
years.

A minimum of 400 personnel is now considered the lowest acceptable level of
manpower. This number would provide four Operational Support Units (OSUs),
the Regiment’s equivalent to the BPS’s Public Support Units or “riot units”.
Included in the 400 personnel would be a de minimis number required for static
guard at a limited number of Key Point (KP) units and a single 30 person Quick
Reaction Force for Island-wide deployment and support. Any total of less than
400 personnel would compromise the Regiment’s effectiveness and ability to
support both operations as currently required. Any reduction would have to give
consideration to the ongoing ability of the BPS to sustain front line operations in
a public order environment in light of the lack of any other available resources.

Reduced numbers would negatively impact the Regiment’s ability to provide a
range of RACA tasks effectively.

Notwithstanding the fact that the Defence Act 1965 intends and provides for
volunteerism to be the driving component with respect to recruitment, the need
������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
Therefore, an unmanaged transition from the current system to an all-volunteer
force increases the risk inherent to relying solely on recruitment.

This risk could be mitigated with a phased abolition of conscription over a period
of time, with four years considered the absolute minimum necessary to effect the
change without a drastic reduction in capability. However, this assumes a 1,000%
increase in the current level of volunteers in each of those four years from current
levels, or an increase from the current ten volunteers per year to a proposed
minimum of 100 volunteers for each of those four years. If an arbitrary target date
were set with no mechanism in place to improve voluntary recruitment, then the
Regiment’s ability to comply effectively with its current obligations under RACA
would be severely compromised.

An all-volunteer Regiment model assumes that Bermuda’s demographics would
support the substantial increases required to sustain current manpower and
operational effectiveness. Some 17% of school leaving males currently serve in the
Regiment, a very high proportion when compared to either the UK or US where
military recruitment represents only a tiny fraction of their overall population
(<1%). Anecdotally, this is evidenced by the Regiment having issued over 11,000
Service Numbers since 1965 for a static local population of approximately 60,000
Bermudians. It is anticipated that there might only be a limited increase in
individuals interested in joining the Regiment once it becomes an all-volunteer
force.

Current demographics of an ageing population and other challenges, including a
diminishing pool of eligible males, compound the problem of recruiting volunteers.

36 GOVERNMENT OF BERMUDA

���������������������������������������������������������������������������������
of volunteers by targeting a greater proportion of female soldiers, there remain
certain operational situations where females may not be deployable because of
either actual physical constraints or public perception and reluctance (i.e., during
riots or other public order incidents). Anecdotal evidence regarding the BPS
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������
materially compromises effectiveness. While it might not be politically correct to
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
bodies are not available on embodiment.

2. _Financial Implications. The Committee believes that the transition to an all-_
volunteer Regiment would require certain operational and administrative
considerations with respect to recruitment and retention that have material
����������������������

An active recruitment campaign will require additional and previously unbudgeted
expenditure without guarantee of success. Meaningful incentives to volunteer
and join and then remain enlisted would need to be considered; however, these
incentives would also represent additional and previously unbudgeted expenditure.

��������������������������������������������������������������������������������
����������������������������������������������������������������������������
would be higher than currently expected of conscripts.While the Regiment could
compensate and accommodate with targeted programmes to address those social
and educational shortcomings, any compensatory programmes would need to be
in addition to (rather than in place of) the minimum training requirements for
operational effectiveness and would require additional and specialized training
that is not currently within the Regiment’s capability or mandate. Provision of
the necessary additional and specialized training would require additional and
previously unbudgeted expenditure.

The Regiment’s current part-time contingent includes a “long stay nucleus” of 134
personnel. Most of these members initially joined the Regiment as conscripts and
enjoyed their service and therefore extended their participation on a voluntary basis.
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
commissioned or warrant, and/or specialists (medic, boat, etc.) and no longer basic
infantry. Creation of an all-volunteer force would therefore most likely result in
����������������������������������������������������������������������������
year groups. This outcome can be undesirable if there is inadequate provision for
the development of future personnel. However, it might be counterproductive to
dismiss members of the “long stay nucleus” based purely on age or rank if their
ability to perform necessary tasks adequately is not compromised. It is to be noted
that a top-heavy rank structure also brings with it higher wage considerations.

NATIONAL SECURITY AND DEFENCE REVIEW 37


-----

The Committee therefore believes, based on the above and on the assumption that
there are no changes to the Regiment’s roles and responsibilities to RACA, that
an all-volunteer model would be considerably more expensive than the current
model.

3. _Budget Constraints. The Committee understands that the Regiment’s budget has_
������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
allocation has required that the Regiment reduce operational manpower and limit
training to basic infantry tasks and essential specialist functions. The Committee
further understands that both operational manpower and training are now viewed
to have reached their fundamental minimums and that the further reduction of
either would disproportionately and negatively affect the Regiment’s effectiveness
and ability to carry out any meaningful RACA without a fundamental change
in role. The Committee believes that Bermuda has been most fortunate that the
������������������������������������������������������������������������������
previous decades to allow for the degree of contraction it has had to accept.

Much of the Regiment’s current funding is spent on operating costs, so very little
long term investment in either equipment or infrastructure is possible. Much of
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
of its useful life, most notably its weapons, vehicles and boats. The Committee
understands that new equipment might be procured from the UK at favourable
rates and the possibility of gifting to a British Overseas Territory must also be
fully explored.

Should the Regiment’s budget remain static, notwithstanding the increased
expenses the Committee perceives an all-volunteer unit will inevitably incur,
the Regiment will have no option but to diminish rather than maintain its
current responsibilities due to budgetary limitations. The Committee notes that,
despite public misperception, ceremonial duties are ancillary to, rather than the
Regiment’s main effort. To keep the Regiment solely for ceremonial purposes at the
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������
inappropriate use of taxpayers’ funds. Therefore, given current and anticipated
budget constraints, the Committee would propose the reduction or elimination of
the following programmes within the Regiment:

�� requirement to provide RABS/RAIC

�� Junior Leaders programme

�� Band and Corps of Drums

�� Gun Troop

�� minimal to no military involvement at ceremonial events

_Option 2: Alternatives to the Bermuda Regiment_
As the Committee has previously noted, the Regiment’s ability to provide a surge of

-----

disciplined and well-marshalled human resources is the key component to several
other emergency services’ and Government Departments’ respective contingency plans.
Currently, there are no contingency plans as to how to provide the required service and
the surge capability if the Regiment did not exist or, if due to operational ineffectiveness,
���������������������������������������

�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
its roles and responsibilities with respect to RACA. The Committee has also noted that
the abolition of conscription will require Government and the Regiment to increase
volunteerism in order to continue to perform those roles and responsibilities if unchanged
���������������������������������������������

There is a small, yet highly vocal, element within the community that repeatedly advocates
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
statutory obligation to serve or a misperception/lack of knowledge or understanding of
the actual roles and responsibilities provided by the Regiment under RACA, beyond the
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
possible options available to Bermuda once Government proceeds with the abolition of
conscription.

���������������������������������������������������������������������������������
notwithstanding the best efforts and commitment of Government and the Regiment to
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
continued effectiveness of the Regiment in performing its obligations to Bermuda.

The Committee has considered the possibility or availability of RACA assistance from
external and international parties in the absence of an effective Regiment:

1. _Redistribute the Roles of the Regiment. The Regiment’s ability to provide a surge_
of disciplined and well-marshalled human resources for internal security and
disaster relief are key components to many other security services’ and Government
Departments’ contingency plans. Even the ceremonial responsibilities of the
Regiment Band and Corps of Drums could theoretically be assumed by another
organization, new or existing and potentially external to Government, but the
resources and costs associated would conceivably be higher elsewhere. Much of
the spectacle of the Band’s performances derives from being a military marching
band with accompanying history and traditions.

Throughout the remainder of this Report, the Committee makes several
recommendations with respect to resources that would be required to meet certain
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������
the services for those needs, giving particular consideration to which existing
or proposed Bermuda-based organizations should deliver these services in the
absence of the Regiment.

NATIONAL SECURITY AND DEFENCE REVIEW 39


-----

While tasks currently performed by or expected of the Regiment could be distributed
amongst other agencies, the Committee feels that this may not always be the
most viable option, as the uniformed services and other Government Departments
already have roles to play during national disasters or the maintenance of public
order. Crucially, the redistribution of tasks would either require a commensurate
transfer of manpower to complete these functions or the surge capacity which is
required to deal with emergencies will be lost. This redistribution of tasks would
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
or Department of Parks employee are higher than those of a part-time Private in
the Regiment, without taking into consideration overtime and danger pay.

2. _Rely on Military Assistance from the UK. The Committee’s discussions with the_
���������������������������������������������������������������������������������
assets to assist in the internal affairs, such as public order situations, of sovereign
states or self-governing territories. The UK’s position in this regard was evidenced
during the recent emergency in the Cayman Islands where requested military
assistance was declined. Domestically, the UK has shifted to police primacy which
means that, at best, Bermuda could only hope to receive police reinforcements.

Whatever the form of assistance, it must be understood that it would take a
minimum of two to three days to identify and mobilize that assistance before it
would even be able to arrive in Bermuda, assuming that the airport is not damaged
or is otherwise not operational. This is in contrast to the four hours required
to embody and mobilize elements of the Regiment currently. This minimum
deployment window of 72 hours plus is longer than the BPS’s current best
estimates for sustained public order operations, without the local surge capacity
afforded by the Regiment. Assistance from overseas should not be expected to be
provided as a free service, although the Committee was unable to determine a
meaningful breakdown of the potential costs, for in the absence of a form or MOU,
there are too many variables to consider. Because of the isolated geographical
position of the Island and its small size, localized events in Bermuda have the
potential and unwelcome propensity to escalate into national emergencies. Such
escalation would be unlikely in a small town or city of similar size and population
in the UK or US.

A well-trained and disciplined domestic force able to provide the required surge
capacity in both emergency and non-emergency instances is therefore considered
a necessity where and when Bermuda is unable to rely on the UK for support in
times of need.

3. Rely on Assistance from the US. The Committee’s discussions with the US Consul
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������
utilize or deploy military assets to assist during internal crises in Bermuda, such

as public order situations, would solely be to safeguard and if necessary extract
������������������������������������������������������������������������������
to domicile US Coast Guard assets in and from Bermuda. Any MOU to provide
any assistance beyond this mandate would require tripartite negotiations that
include the UK FCO. The considerations set out in paragraphs two and three
under ‘Rely on Military Assistance from the UK’ above apply here as well.

4. _Rely on Assistance from the Caribbean._ Anecdotal evidence and experience
would suggest that, notwithstanding CARICOM and other regional treaties or
commitments for mutual assistance, most military units within the Caribbean
lack the transport capability to provide any meaningful assistance overseas or
the ability to be self-sustaining if deployed overseas. Notwithstanding logistical
constraints, any MOU to provide assistance would require tripartite negotiations
that include the UK FCO. The considerations set out in paragraphs two and three
under ‘Rely on Military Assistance from the UK’ above apply here as well.

5. _Rely on Assistance from Elsewhere._ The Committee believes that it would be
unrealistic in the extreme for Bermuda to expect to receive from an unrelated
third party immediate and emergency assistance to address internal crises in
Bermuda, such as public order situations, without either a compelling interest or
lucrative contract or MOU pre-negotiated and in place. The considerations set out
in paragraph two and three under ‘Rely on Military Assistance from the UK’ above
apply here also.

6. _Privatization._ Reputable private companies could be contracted to provide
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������
breakdown of the potential costs, as there are too many variables to consider. With
respect to disaster relief, Bermuda could in effect be paying a higher “premium”
than it currently does for the Regiment by engaging professional third parties to
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
the Regiment would cease to be an indirect training facility, an outcome that could
result in the gradual deterioration of certain skill sets.

Despite Government’s desire to source contracts locally, certain capabilities may
not be best delivered by a solely local solution. Additionally, the privatization of
armed response and public order surge capacities cannot occur in the absence of
��������������������������������������������

The Committee accepts that internal security and additional disaster relief could
theoretically be provided by any number of different means — additional Police
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������
example. However, these alternatives have disadvantages in cost, response time,
lack of guarantee of a disciplined force and questionable legitimacy, all of which
suggest that capability is best retained by the Regiment.

_Option 3: Modify Structure and Role of the Regiment_
Having given careful thought to Bermuda’s current economic conditions and the recent
increase in unemployment amongst Bermudians, the Committee considered the possibility
of restructuring the Regiment by increasing the opportunity for full-time employment.

However the Committee believes that creating a more professional force through the
reduction of part-time personnel would not result in a reduction in overall costs, as it is
anticipated that there will need to be an increase in the number of full-time personnel
to ensure that the Regiment is able carry out its existing and proposed responsibilities.
������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
expanded maritime capabilities as discussed elsewhere in the Report, would comprise
100 full-time staff and 300 part-time staff. The related costs under this scenario would
equate to approximately $18.7 million, not including training and equipment costs approximately $10.0 million for the 100 full-time personnel ($3.0 million for existing 28
staff, $3.4 million proposed for 30 full-time maritime staff and approximately $3.6 million
for remaining 42 staff) and about $8.7 million for the part-time component (assuming an
average part-time annual salary of $29,000 based on $2,000 base salary per month and
annual bonus of $5,000). Some savings in this regard may be achieved by introducing a
tiered level of part-time volunteerism between ‘regular’ and ‘reserve’ staff, whereby the
latter would be paid less in exchange for reduced time commitments.

As the Committee has acknowledged elsewhere in this Report, a reduction in manpower
would provide further savings with respect to the Regiment, but would necessitate the
reduction or refocusing of the Regiment’s current responsibilities. It should be noted
that the redistribution amongst existing or new resources within Government and
the community of those services currently provided by the Regiment, but unable to be
addressed by a smaller Regiment, would most likely not be possible within existing
budgets.

��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
of the structure and role of the Regiment is essential in order to provide the stimulus
necessary to attract and retain the dramatic increase in volunteers that will be required
following the abolition of conscription.

The Committee recommends refocusing the Regiment more heavily towards those
responsibilities relating to RACM and RACP in order to make the Regiment’s contributions
more readily visible, thereby allaying the common misperception that the Regiment’s
only current contribution relates to RABS ceremonial duties.

The Committee notes that the current Commissioner of Police has expressed a desire to
refocus the BPS on law enforcement and to divest/delegate ancillary services, including
maritime operations, explosive ordnance disposal, crowd cordons and control and search
������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
and role of the Regiment in order to assume some or all of those and other responsibilities
could provide the stimulus necessary to increase volunteerism.

1. _Maritime Operations. The Committee notes that there have been many suggestions_
or commentaries with respect to the establishment of a full-time maritime
capability to address law enforcement, border protection, drug interdiction and
search and rescue. As noted previously, the Commissioner of Police has expressed
his desire to refocus on law enforcement and to divest/delegate ancillary services
to appropriate third parties.

The Regiment could be re-established as a smaller maritime unit, or Coast
Guard, in line with the proposal presented to Cabinet in February 2013, with the
opportunity to expand the role to include also a deep-sea capability once the Island
has determined its position and direction with respect to the EEZ and Sargasso
Sea protection. Building upon operational synergies and previous experience, the
Regiment has expressed the desire to expand the role of its current Boat Troop to
include an enforcement role on the water, initially with an inshore capability and
to expand eventually to include the entire EEZ.

A February 2013 Cabinet Memorandum proposed transferring inshore (within
the inner reefs and, weather dependent, to the outer shelf if necessary) maritime
patrolling responsibilities to the Regiment Boat Troop. The Memorandum
proposes that the Boat Troop would have 24 full-time staff and ten part-time staff,
plus necessary training, kit and equipment for an additional $3.4 million per year
(as compared to the current BPS notional establishment of 14 personnel and an
annual budget of $1.3 million).

������������������������������������������������������������������������������
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������
reduction in overall manpower would be offset by increased employment costs for
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������
increased equipment and maintenance costs. The Regiment’s Boat Troop has an
established strength of eight craft, of which four craft were donated by the BPS
once they were deemed no longer operationally serviceable or insurable by Lloyds’
standards. Consequently, a replacement programme would have to be considered
in order to ensure the long-term effectiveness of any maritime patrolling.

�������������������������������������������������������������������������
including providing other agencies such as the BPS, Customs, Immigration and
Fisheries with a means of boarding vessels and projecting authority, a �������������
smaller Regiment with a narrower operational focus would eliminate the
ability to provide surge capability for internal security or disaster relief efforts. In
the Committee’s view, the expansion of the Boat Troop, should it be considered,
should be as a distinct or additional capability completely separate from any other
current or future role of responsibility of the Regiment. Anecdotal evidence from
current BPS experiences would indicate that having maritime capabilities and
responsibilities and an ancillary/secondary specialty actually limits operational

NATIONAL SECURITY AND DEFENCE REVIEW 43


-----

effectiveness due to constraints of resource allocations. The Regiment would be
unable to provide any OSUs or an effective KP static guard.

While the capabilities of a smaller unit may be enhanced by the use of unmanned
aircraft or drones, the technology has not yet reached the point where these assets
can provide a cost-effective patrolling or information gathering system, as they
must be targeted with some degree of accuracy in order to be effective.

The Committee acknowledges that it is possible for the Regiment to develop
offshore maritime capabilities as well. However, the Island has not yet developed a
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������
While the Regiment could take over the operation of the larger BPS vessel
_Guardian, further study into the cost-effective use of this capability on sustained_
maritime operations will be required. Anecdotal evidence from BIOS regarding
the M/V _Reef Explorer suggests a minimum $500,000 a year operating budget_
for fuel/lubricants for a single vessel, excluding maintenance, service, spares and
salaries. This amount also does not include initial replacement costs of vessel or
insurance costs.

The Committee believes that further consideration should be given to additional
personnel and associated costs that extended offshore patrolling would require,
minimum 24-hour shifts and the possible requirement of more than one vessel. If
patrols are to cover areas beyond the 12-mile radius out to the 200-mile exclusion
zone, multi-day excursions will be required, a circumstance which will require
more than one watch to cover 24-hour shifts which would limit the ability of the
personnel involved to re-task for onshore duties easily or concurrently.

2. _As a Light Engineering Unit. ��������������������������������������������������_
run along the lines of a Light Infantry Battalion with the addition of a small
maritime support capability. However, current threat assessments would imply
that no credible external threat to Bermuda’s security or sovereignty exists that
would require a continued focus on solely conventional infantry skills preparing
for situations that are unlikely to occur in Bermuda. Therefore, consideration
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
skills within a military framework, thereby preparing more adequately for those
scenarios which are far more predictable and affect the entire population.

Re-roling the Regiment as a Light Engineering Battalion with recognized civilianequivalent development and training programmes for technical skills could also
be seen as a catalyst for increasing volunteerism and participation. A re-roled
Regiment could be responsible for disaster assessment and coordination while still
providing surge capability for internal security matters, including OSUs and KPs.

The Regiment would also be able to assume certain ancillary operational
responsibilities that may be delegated from the BPS or other Government

44 GOVERNMENT OF BERMUDA


-----

Departments or agencies including, but not limited to, maritime operations and
rescue diving and special operations (surveillance, incident containment, sniper
and explosive ordnance disposal and demolitions). The Regiment would also be
able to retain its ability to provide RABS through the continuation of its more
ceremonial duties through the retention of the Regiment Band and Drums Corps
and Gun Troop, as well as the Junior Leaders programme.

����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
in terms of cost reduction. Initial and ongoing costs would actually increase as
a result of the need to address the increased training in specialist skills, as well
as those costs previously addressed elsewhere with respect to infrastructure,
equipment and recruitment.

3. _Overseas Deployment and Humanitarianism. The Regiment has repeatedly made_
a good name for itself and for Bermuda through the low-skill support it has been
able to provide through disaster relief to some Caribbean nations.

The Committee understands that several parties, including but not limited to
���������������������������������������������������������������������������
Bermuda as a means of fostering improved sovereign relations and potentially
increasing volunteerism.

However, the United Nations standard Memorandum of Understanding for the
deployment of military forces overseas to participate in civilian-military coordinated
disaster relief operations mandates that the relevant military force must be 100%
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
to be either effective or sustainable in these circumstances. The Committee
believes that consideration of such an expanded role for the Regiment should be
���������������������������������������������������������������������������������
this manner.

4. _As a Non-Military Unit. The Regiment could be re-roled as a non-military unit with_
a focus on a national risk and disaster assessment and coordination role, similar
to the model that was introduced in Panama and Costa Rica upon the voluntary
disbandment of their respective military forces. This option would be similar to
re-roling as a Light Engineering Unit in terms of a predominantly engineering
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
and with no armed response capability.

While a non-military unit might address a perceived vocal minority’s concerns regarding
the need for the Island to retain a military force, it would limit or eliminate the Regiment’s
ability to provide surge capacity to the BPS for certain internal security or public order
matters. While a non-military unit would effectively provide the Island with a form of “job

-----

corps” during these challenging economic times, the elimination of the internal security
component would, in fact, result in the unnecessary duplication of efforts and resources
which might be better addressed by redistributing the Regiment’s non-security roles to
other Government Departments and emergency services, but with the caveats already
�����������������������������������������������������

_Option 4: National Service_
The Committee acknowledges that some Bermudians do not see the relevance of the
Regiment to their day-to-day lives, nor do they see the Regiment adding value to the
Island overall. The Committee therefore considered the suggestion of the formation of
a National Service framework that would carry out focused tasks in the community.
This framework has been considered by previous Governments as a possible alternative
to the Regiment, as well as an opportunity to encourage young Bermudians — or those
who wish to become Bermudian — to play a positive and active role in the future of the
country.

The Committee considered a public-spirited compulsory National Service programme as
an alternative to volunteerism and conscription, but felt that the disadvantages, whether
they be actual or perceived, were not inconsequential:

�� _Cost. Those participating must be paid a minimum wage for their contribution._
Any training is likely to incur some additional costs, especially in the initial stages.

�� _Command and Administration. Those undergoing National Service will require_
oversight and some degree of administration for pay and progression of training.

�� _Compulsory Participation. National Service will require all Bermudians within a_
certain age range to participate. Not everyone will wish to take part.

�� _Conscription Comparison. Some members of the community will say that National_
Service is conscription by another name.

�� _Slavery Analogy. Some members of the community may attempt to portray_
compulsory attendance as a throwback to slavery.

The Committee therefore recommends that National Service not be considered as a viable
option.

_Option 5: Maintain Current Model_
The Committee acknowledges that Government’s intention to abolish conscription was
expressly beyond the scope of this review. Nevertheless, in order to present a complete
analysis, the Committee was obliged within the context of the review to give some
consideration to the impact that the abolition of conscription will have on Bermuda.

To that end, it must be noted that many of the challenges associated with the abolition
of conscription raised by various stakeholders would be alleviated or eliminated by
either the extended deferral of the abolition (i.e., longer than four years) or a complete

46 GOVERNMENT OF BERMUDA


-----

reversal of the current position on conscription and its elimination. Maintaining the
current Regiment model or a variant thereof, being mindful of the Committee’s other
recommendations, within which conscription remains a component as currently legislated,
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
the security and safety services available to the Government and Bermuda as a whole.

Again, the Committee acknowledges that the matter of retaining conscription is outside
its remit.

#### Committee Recommendations

_Implement a phased approach to the abolition of conscription. The Bermuda Government_
has announced its intention to abolish conscription. However, after consultation with
former and current Regiment personnel, emergency responders and other agencies, the
Committee has discovered that certain less publicly visible aspects of national defence,
internal security and disaster relief currently provided by the Regiment might not be easily
transferrable to or absorbed by other emergency services or Government Departments,
either in part or as a whole. It is therefore critical that the transition from a volunteer
force supplemented by conscription to an all-volunteer force be conducted over a time
frame that preserves those national defence, internal security and disaster relief aspects
provided by the Regiment currently or in the future, subject to this review.

_Change the mission and strategic role of the Regiment. Given the announced plan to end_
conscription, the Regiment must modernize its mission and role to make it more relevant
to the real world situation in Bermuda. Re-direction of the Regiment’s focus on disaster
recovery with a Light Engineering focus while providing the essential military support
to the BPS is a feasible way forward. Acknowledging the Government’s current limited
������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
on disaster recovery and transferable real-life skills in order to increase volunteerism by
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
of supporting RACA and, in particular, the BPS, Bermuda Fire and Rescue Services and
the Department of Corrections. By developing the right military capabilities, residents
of Bermuda will enjoy an extremely high and cost-effective Regiment. In this vein, the
Committee believes the following components to be fundamental for the new Regiment
������������������������������������������������������������������

1. _Re-role from light infantry to light engineers._ Change from a Light Infantry
Battalion to a Light Engineering Battalion with focused specialist rather than
generalist skills. Not only would this make the Regiment far more useful to
Bermuda in times of an emergency, but it would also be an improvement on a
day-to-day basis. However, this must also be done in context with the requirement
that the Regiment is able to provide immediate surge capability to the BPS in
public order scenarios or while patrolling and ensuring public safety during and
at large events.

NATIONAL SECURITY AND DEFENCE REVIEW 47


-----

2. _Expand the Regiment’s maritime capability._ Expand the role of the Regiment’s
current Boat Troop to include an enforcement role on the water, initially with
an inshore capability to be developed eventually to include the entire EEZ, in
line with the referenced Cabinet Memorandum of February 2013. The expansion
should be as a distinct or additional capability, completely separate from any other
current or future role or responsibility of the Regiment and should not be done in
a manner that would compromise the Regiment’s ability to provide the BPS with
immediate surge capacity when required.

3. _Develop an effective recruiting strategy. To preserve the future of the Regiment_
in any form, a robust recruiting strategy must be implemented. Experience
from other jurisdictions indicates that this strategy must be based on personal
���������������������������������������������������������������������������������
emphasis of recruiting is based principally on expensive advertising[14] [15] and
�������������������[16] to join, numbers are unlikely to increase while valuable time
and money are wasted.

### Border Protection

#### HM Customs

The mission of the Customs Department (HM Customs) is to promote compliance with
Bermuda’s customs laws through quality service and responsible enforcement, thereby
contributing to the Island’s economic and social stability. Its mandate is to facilitate
legitimate trade, assess and collect revenue and interdict drugs and other contraband.

HM Customs, with an establishment of 214, an actual complement of 200 and a budget
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
��������������������������������

HM Customs is established under the Customs Department Act 1952, but the primary
legislation governing its operation is the Revenue Act 1898. The main focus of HM
Customs is, therefore, revenue collection, although it is recognized that the protection of
Bermuda’s borders is also a key legislated responsibility of HM Customs.

Currently, HM Customs is a part of the Ministry of Finance. However, it has been agreed
that effective 1 April 2014, the Department will move to the Ministry of National Security
and that the Collector will report to both the Minister of Finance and the Minister of
National Security.

While access to Bermuda by persons and items can be gained in a multitude of ways, the
main routes are:

as a law enforcement agency by other agencies and is not given access to critical
information by other uniformed services and agencies. This is a matter that must
be addressed as most of the seizures made by Customs result from intelligence
gathering.

2. While joint operations have been effectively used to convict many drug importers
over the years, there currently is no joint operation between the BPS and Customs
with respect to drug interdiction and criminal activity at Bermuda’s borders. A
previously existing Memorandum of Understanding between Customs and the
BPS was negated by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 2006 (PACE). Whilst
the BPS operates in accordance to the PACE regulations, HM Customs does
not. This disparity has created operational challenges in the handling of law
enforcement issues within Customs areas and in joint operations between the BPS
and HM Customs. The natural evolution should be for the BPS to relinquish this
area of criminal investigations to HM Customs, as is the case in many overseas
jurisdictions. An alternative approach could be for the border control aspect of drug
interdiction to become a principal responsibility of the BPS, but this approach is
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
BPS and would not effectively address many of the other issues related to border

3. Whilst HM Customs has primacy at Bermuda’s borders and ports of entry, the
BPS has responsibility for the enforcement of provisions of the Misuse of Drugs
Act 1972 at the borders and the conduct of criminal investigations for all drug

function. This delegated responsibility militates against the ability of HM Customs
to carry out all aspects of its legislated role effectively.

5. The private jet facility at the LF Wade International Airport is not subject to 100%
law enforcement coverage.

in Bermuda.

7. HM Customs does not have its own marine section with which to transport

lack of resources on the water for HM Customs, combined with approximately
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������

��������������������������������������������������������������������������������
results in seizures of contraband. However, the lack of consistent x-ray screening
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
could potentially be transited into the Island by this route.

9. The Joint Intelligence Unit (JIU) was formerly comprised of staff from four
elements: HM Customs, US Customs, the BPS and the Department of Immigration.
Because of budget cuts, it now consists of HM Customs and the BPS only. The
current arrangement is seen as less than satisfactory as the information sharing
that was facilitated by having all of these components in one room made the JIU
more effective in the discharge of its responsibilities.

�������������������������������������������������������������������������������
the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security have resulted in
restrictions in the amount and kind of information that US border authorities can
share with the JIU which is not a formal border protection agency.

11. There currently is no centralized database through which HM Customs, the BPS
and the Department of Immigration can share information/intelligence. There is a
compelling need to establish such database, as it would enhance the ability of HM

and effectively.

12. A proposed joint database with the Caribbean Customs Law Enforcement Council
(CCLEC) would provide HM Customs with the ability to engage in effective and
necessary collaboration with agencies in the Caribbean area and elsewhere.

13. Communications between HM Customs and the Department of Marine and Ports
agencies are satisfactory. Harbour Radio generally contacts HM Customs to warn
of approaching yachts, allowing HM Customs (subject to available resources) to
mobilize and meet these yachts. In this way, HM Customs discharges both its
primary responsibilities and its delegated Immigration responsibilities.

protection. In order to address the challenges and ensure that customs and border control
issues are effectively addressed, three options are presented. Legislative amendments
and Regulations will be required to give effect to some of the initiatives required under
these options. The options follow:

�� _Option 1 Maintain the current regime_

�� _Option 2 Create a Border Protection Unit comprised of personnel from relevant_
agencies, including HM Customs, the BPS and Immigration

�� _Option 3 Establish a separate and distinct Customs and Border Protection Agency_
within the Ministry of National Security with legislated responsibilities for
enforcing measures related to the movement of people and goods across borders

_Option 1: Maintain the current structure_
Enhancements to the current HM Customs structure could lead to improvements in the
effectiveness of the Department’s operation overall, particularly with respect to border
���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
and effective framework that appropriately complies with international standards.
Enhancements that could be made include:

�� Increasing the number of K9 units;

�� Addressing issues relating to domestic cooperation through a working
Memorandum of Understanding with the BPS, a centralized database or at the
very least increasing the access that HM Customs has to other law enforcement
agencies;

�� Creating a culture within HM Customs that places greater focus on enforcement
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������
enforcement matters, using civilians for as many of the revenue and administrative
roles as possible, changing the name of the Act that governs the responsibilities
and requirements relating to Customs matters from the Revenue Act to a title that
downplays the revenue role (although the importance of the revenue collection
function is recognized) and removing the term “Collector” from the title of the
head of the Customs Department;

�� Expanding the use of joint operational teams in drug interdiction and other such
initiatives;

������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
structure. However, the level to which the enhancements can be implemented may be
limited by the current structure, a circumstance that constitutes a key drawback to this
option. Consequently, the effectiveness of an enhanced unit may not be commensurate
with the investment made in people and funding. Impediments with information sharing
from external agencies will continue to exist in an enhanced current structure even if,
for example, the approach is taken to continue a JIU at the airport. In addition, the use
of joint operational teams will continue to be integral to the regime, based on the current
structure, and their contributions/availability will be impacted by the priorities within
the various agencies involved.

_Option 2: Create a Border Protection Unit comprised of personnel from key agencies,_
_notably Customs, the BPS and Immigration_
This option assumes that a Border Protection Unit will be a specialized entity with
delegated functions to carry out the key border control duties and that it will be comprised
of seconded staff with the relevant expertise from the various agencies. Mindful of the
fact that this proposal recommends a separate or dedicated agency whose staff will be
seconded from other agencies, the Committee considers it unlikely that the proposed unit
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
remain key gaps that cannot be addressed. The provision of effective leadership would be
a key challenge were this option selected, given that its staff will be seconded from other
agencies and may at times be subject to the priorities of the agencies that employ them.
The provision of effective information exchange is a second key challenge accompanying
this option, as the proposed unit will not be a legislated agency but, in essence, an “ad-hoc”
unit. Further, given that some of the proposed unit’s duties might fall within the purview
of different agencies, effective prioritization of responsibilities will be challenging. The
Committee believes that with this option, HM Customs will become even more revenue
focused, as the enforcement aspects will be assigned to this specialized unit.

Creating the appropriate legislative and operational framework for an effective Customs
and Border Protection Unit with the right focus on enforcement would necessitate
incorporating into the regime the enhancements noted under Option 1 above. However,
although this model, by its very nature, would require a high degree of domestic
cooperation and information sharing, the need for joint operations on activities taking

_Option 3: Expand and update the Customs mandate to create a Customs and Border_
_Protection Agency with legislated responsibilities for all enforcement measures relating to_
_the movement of people and goods across borders._
Option 3 involves the legislated re-designation of HM Customs as a law enforcement
agency that is responsible for border enforcement, immigration enforcement and customs
services in relation to the movement of people and goods. Canada and Australia, for
example, have already developed border control agencies along the lines proposed in this
option. Jamaica’s Customs Department has responsibility for the processing of passengers
as well as goods. The UK has created a Border Agency that, as noted on its website,[17]
“is responsible for protecting the UK border so that authorized travellers and legitimate
goods can pass freely”, but it is Immigration led and focused. UK Revenue and Customs
has a broad revenue role and is also involved in aspects of monitoring compliance, by

be unsuitable for replication in the Bermuda context.

Creating the appropriate legislative and operational framework for an effective Customs
and Border Protection Agency with the right focus on enforcement would necessitate
incorporating into the regime the enhancements noted under Option 1 above. However,
although this model, by its very nature, would require a high degree of domestic
cooperation and information sharing, the need for joint operations on activities taking
place on land (with the attendant challenges that can result) would probably be reduced.

Option 3 anticipates that the legislative changes required for the Customs and Border

name of the Act) to reinforce further the new focus on enforcement. Customs and Border

borders. Enhanced procedures relating to the screening of passengers and goods for
arriving private yachts, private jets and cruise ships should be developed and implemented
along with appropriate upgrades to the screening of mail. In addition, as noted in the
discussions under the Department of Immigration heading, gaps in relation to screening

A review of all of the relevant requirements in relation to addressing the border and control

#### Committee Recommendations

_Expand and update the Customs mandate to create a Customs and Border Protection_
_Agency with legislated responsibilities for all enforcement measures relating to the_
_movement of people and goods across borders. Having an effective Customs and Border_
Protection Agency is critical to Bermuda’s national security and to its reputation as a

review of the Department of Immigration and other related agencies.

_Conduct a review of Bermuda’s border control and protection needs and take the required_
_steps to address the gaps as a matter of urgency. A comprehensive_ review of Bermuda’s
border control and protection requirements must be carried out as a matter of urgency to
determine the precise scope and provisions of the legislative and operational framework
required, along with the attendant manpower and other resources. Taking the necessary
steps to ensure that the Customs and Border Control Agency is able to operate effectively
is required for Bermuda to comply with international standards. However, taking such
action on an expedited basis is critical in light of ongoing developments particularly in
relation to Bermuda’s Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorist Financing regime.

_Enhance arrival-screening processes. The mechanisms in place in relation to persons and_
goods arriving in Bermuda must be enhanced to prevent illegal travel and movement of
goods into Bermuda. Consideration must be given to expanding the current procedures in
relation to private jets, yachts and other marine craft entering Bermuda to ensure that a

1. It was suggested that it would be prudent to invest in the ability to identify
craft in the EEZ and monitor vessels for suspicious activity. Those that land in
Bermuda or have interaction with other boats from the Island should be targeted
for interdiction inshore or on arrival and those moving out of the area can be
reported to other jurisdictions to monitor.

2. A limited capability exists to operate inshore. However, this capability could be
developed to provide an effective interdiction and enforcement force with relative
ease.

3. The ability to conduct interdiction and enforcement offshore physically is more
problematic and resource intensive, with uncertain returns as little is known
of illegal activity in this vast area. The development of an offshore marine force
would require investment in manpower, training, boats, fuel and infrastructure,
all of which would take time and considerable funding.

#### Committee Recommendations

_Conduct a review for the establishment of a protective zone for the EEZ. There is a need_
to establish a protective zone around the Island for the protection of Bermuda’s valued
marine life, while at the same time providing an avenue for security forces to interdict
illicit offshore activities. Additionally, the establishment of a protective marine reserve
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
research is required to determine the economic implications for a protective marine zone
around the Island. The inability for Bermuda to mine its marine resources within its own
EEZ in the future is a concern that must be mitigated.

_Expand the Regiment’s existing Boat Troop capability in an enforcement role to protect_
_the EEZ and improve internal security. Some transit through the EEZ consists of_
legitimate trans-Atlantic marine vessels, but it is also the case that there are vessels
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
A limited interdiction and enforcement capability also exists for Bermuda’s inshore area.
The expansion of the Regiment’s Boat Troop or other designated resources to work with
������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
step in addressing such matters. The Committee notes in this regard that the Regiment
currently has the ability to operate on inshore waters and potentially could expand its

NATIONAL SECURITY AND DEFENCE REVIEW 55

equipment and expertise to protect the Island inshore and offshore in those areas where
most maritime activity occurs and, perhaps ultimately, throughout Bermuda’s EEZ.

#### Department of Immigration

The key legislated responsibilities of the Department of Immigration are set out in the
Bermuda Immigration and Protection Act 1956. The Transnational Organized Crime Act
������������������������������������������������������������������������������

�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
the Department of Immigration responsibility for primary Immigration clearance at
Bermuda’s borders. Reductions were made in the manpower allocated to the Department
������������������������������������������������������������������

_����������������_
1. The Department of Immigration does not address effectively the protection of
outgoing borders, that is, it has no system in place for the effective monitoring of
persons who leave the Island prior to their departure. The passengers’ manifest on
persons departing Bermuda via air is made available to the Department only after
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
to the US. However, information sharing from US authorities is limited. Further,
there is no Immigration clearance carried out on passengers exiting to Canada,
the United Kingdom, and other non-US ports. Incorporating such responsibilities
into the mandate and operation of the proposed Customs and Border Protection
Agency will facilitate the Department of Immigration gaining timely information
on departing passengers and will enhance its ability to identify persons engaged in
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
leaving Bermuda should be put in place. As an interim measure, the risks with
respect to US departures could be mitigated by appropriate and timely information
sharing between Bermuda and US authorities.

2. As noted above, there is over reliance on other jurisdictions to carry out adequate
screening of visitors, on departing passengers. However there is also evidence of
such over reliance in relation to arriving passengers. In order for border control to
be conducted more effectively, the Department of Immigration and/or the proposed
Customs and Border Protection Agency, as appropriate, must be empowered and
��������������������������������������������������

3. The process for the dissemination and management of information on persons
subjected to a travel ban under international sanctions must be enhanced. It has

56 GOVERNMENT OF BERMUDA


-----

been noted that not every visitor requires an entry visa for Bermuda. Persons who
do require visas for entry into Bermuda must obtain a multi-entry visa, a process
which requires a level of screening that is not needed for those who do not require
a visa for entry into Bermuda. These gaps in the screening of persons who enter
Bermuda must be addressed in a proposed review of the operational procedures
relating to border protection.

4. Focused monitoring at the various (non-airport) ports of entry into the Island is
required to mitigate the risk of illegal entry into Bermuda. Smaller sailing vessels
entering the Town of St. George are of particular concern in this regard.

5. It should be noted that there are checks in place for children travelling, especially
when not with a parent. These are enforced by the airlines to prevent a person
from taking a child normally resident in Bermuda from the Island without the
permission of a parent or the courts. However, there are gaps with respect to
illegal travel by adults. By way of example, procedures and protocols with other
agencies must be established for persons on bail or otherwise before the courts to
prevent them from absconding from the Island.

6. Immigration’s key focus is on work permit processing. As the Department of
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������
Immigration’s access to information from other agencies. Having appropriate
measures in place for effective domestic cooperation and information sharing is
seen as key to effective border protection.

7. There is currently no MOU between the Department of Immigration and HM
Customs, notwithstanding the fact that Customs has been delegated the key
Immigration responsibility of primary passenger clearance at the Island’s borders.
The required MOU will be in place should a Customs and Border Protection Agency
be established in Bermuda.

8. The Department of Immigration has a Customer Relationship Management
(CRM) system which retains records of all Immigration applications and other
historical data regarding people and their external travel. The HM Customs team
does not have full access to the secondary level of information on the CRM system
and must request information from the higher tier when required. In addition, the
BPS has access to some of the information from this system. It was noted that both
BPS and HM Customs could buy additional facilities from the software vendor. It
is recommended that this gap in information sharing be addressed.

9. Mechanisms to monitor the length of stay of visitors and procedures to locate persons
who overstay their allotted time on the Island are required. This matter should be
reviewed as part of the review on the appropriate structure/responsibilities of the
proposed Customs and Border Protection Agency.

NATIONAL SECURITY AND DEFENCE REVIEW 57


-----

#### Committee Recommendations

_Develop appropriate departure screening processes and ensure that there are measures_
_for adequate information to be made available to effectively address the risks. The over_
reliance on other jurisdictions with regard to the screening of departing passengers is a
gap that must be addressed. Bermuda should take measures to institute its own checks on
departing passengers as part of the responsibilities of the Customs and Border Protection
Agency. The processing of passengers departing to US ports can be done either separately
or in conjunction with US authorities, as appropriate, but a checking mechanism must
be instituted in relation to passengers departing directly to Canada, the United Kingdom
and other non-US ports. However, to ensure that these gaps are addressed effectively
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
shared and is available on a timely basis. Ensuring that appropriate MOUs are in place
and that there is access to required databases are important in this regard.

_Develop appropriate mechanisms to monitor visitor lengths of stay in Bermuda._ The
Department of Immigration must develop appropriate mechanisms to monitor the length
of stay of visitors.

_Develop processes and procedures to address violation of Immigration policies. Using the_
resources of the Department of Immigration and/or the Customs and Border Protection
Agency, it is important to put in place effective processes to locate persons who overstay
their allotted time on the Island and to address violations of Immigration policies.

#### Department of Marine and Ports Services

The primary role of the Department of Marine and Ports Services is to oversee marine
affairs in Bermuda. As such, the Department is responsible for the safe movement
������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
through the operation of the Ferry Service. It also has responsibility for port operations,
including pilotage, tug and line boat assistance and the maintenance of all marine aids
to navigation. Salvage work, boat and mooring registration, oil spill response, offshore
marine search and rescue and seaport security are amongst the Department’s areas of
operational responsibility.

Another key role of the Department of Marine and Ports Services is the surveillance of
the entire Bermuda coastline via radar stations located at Gibb’s Hill in Southampton
and the Fort George Coast Station (also known as Bermuda Harbour Radio or the
MOC) in the Town of St George. The data from the Gibb’s Hill location is transferred
to Bermuda Harbour Radio via microwave transmission. With the exception of areas
around the western end of Bermuda, all vessels entering and leaving the Island can be

58 GOVERNMENT OF BERMUDA


-----

effectively monitored by the radar facilities and are in communication with Bermuda
Harbour Radio.

_Legislated Responsibilities_
The principal legislation that underpins the work of the Department of Marine and
Ports Services are the Marine Board Act 1962, the International Ship and Port Facility
Security (ISPS) code and the Dockyard Port Act 1905. The Department is also guided by
provisions set out in ancillary legislation.

The Department has deployed a multi-layered, risk-based approach that enhances the
security of Bermuda’s maritime borders, upholds the safety of the community and utilizes
all appropriate resources and capabilities to combat the greatest risks to Bermuda and
������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
and entering Bermuda.

This multi-layered approach is internationally compliant and encompasses, but is not
limited to, the following:

�� border security

�� disaster preparedness, inclusive of mass casualties scenarios

�� law enforcement, both domestically and internationally where applicable

�� laws and regulations that combat the Island’s greatest transportation risks

_Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC Bermuda)_
������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
search and rescue support, including coordination with US Coast Guard operations when
necessary.

_Vessel Traffic Coastal Radar Surveillance (VTS)_
VTS serves as the backbone of the Bermuda Maritime Domain Awareness programme
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
combined on one platform to assist border control, search and rescue, environmental
protection and port operations.

_Coast Radio Station (Bermuda Radio, Call Sign ZBR)_
The marine communications hub (Bermuda Radio, call sign ZBR) is interconnected with
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) where Bermuda has declared
A1/A2 radio coverage in this area of the Atlantic. In accordance with an international
broadcast schedule, 24-hour watch-keeping on international distress frequencies and
the dissemination of marine safety Information are being broadcast around the clock.
������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
provided on a case-by-case basis and port operations involving matters of pilotage and

_�����������������_
1. As noted and addressed previously in the section of the Report dealing with
HM Customs, there is a need to develop and strengthen inshore and offshore
interdiction capabilities and to establish enforcement capabilities via legislation.

2. There is potential for physical monitoring upgrades (radar capabilities, for
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������
marine vessels. The current radar system (which includes Gibb’s Hill Lighthouse)
is designed to give full 360-degree coverage. There is, however, an area in the west
end of the Island where coverage is not complete. This area is in need of urgent
attention.

3. Targeted intelligence-led interception between the Department of Marine and
Ports Services and the US Coast Guard must be formally established. Such

-----

arrangement would allow local maritime authorities to engage in more effective
policing of local waters for stowaways, drugs, weapons and other contraband
within the 12-mile radius of Bermuda. Such arrangement would also enable the
���������������������������������������������������������������������������������
other illegal activities up to the 200-mile radius outside of Bermuda’s national
waters.

#### Committee Recommendations

_Establish effective marine coverage for the western portion of the Island. More effective_
marine coverage for the western end of the Island is needed. The eastern and central
portion of Bermuda’s inshore waters are well covered by two radar installations based at
the MOC in St. George’s and on top of Gibb’s Hill Lighthouse in Southampton. Coverage
on the western end of the Island is less effective. A third radar post located further
west to provide effective coverage at that end of the Island is vital to reduce blind spots,
especially as a disproportionate amount of suspicious marine activity occurs to the west
of Bermuda.

_���������������������������������������������������������������_ The Government
should consider making it compulsory for all vessels travelling beyond the barrier reefs
surrounding the Island to be equipped with AIS. AIS provides marine craft with a unique
identity signal that allows movement to be tracked more readily and accurately by the

The General Manager is responsible for maintaining the safety and security of the airport,
developing a better facility by taking advantage of emerging market opportunities, keeping
abreast of revenue projections and adhering to international norms and regulations for
operating such a facility.

_Legislated Responsibilities_
The Civil Airports Act 1949 is the principal legislation that informs the work of the

NATIONAL SECURITY AND DEFENCE REVIEW 61


-----

Department of Airport Operations. The Department is also guided by provisions set out
in ancillary legislation.

_����������������_
1. In some instances, LF Wade International Airport does not fully meet the standards
set by the US Customs and Border Protection Agency. Strict adherence to TSA
regulations with respect to protocols and equipment is required to reduce the risk
of loss of Bermuda’s current pre-US Customs and Immigration clearance status.

2. There is a need to explore methods to screen incoming luggage as well as to
implement greater and tighter security in the vicinity of aircraft ramps.

3. CCTV surveillance cameras need to be installed with a view to enhancing airport
perimeter security.

4. More stringent standards must be established for the security vetting of airport
personnel.

#### Committee Recommendation

_Increase the security of LF Wade International Airport._ Increased physical security of
the operations, passenger terminals and perimeter of LF Wade International Airport is
required. The presence of appropriate Border Protection personnel in the pre-clearance
areas of the airport is also required, together with an expansion of CCTV surveillance
and security coverage of the airport and its immediate environs.

NATIONAL SECURITY AND DEFENCE REVIEW 63

### Law and Public Order

#### Bermuda Police Service

The Bermuda Police Service (BPS) plays a pivotal role in maintaining the generally safe
and peaceful environment that we have come to enjoy in Bermuda. The BPS enjoys a
fairly high level of support from the public which looks to it for protection and support
during times of natural or other catastrophes. The Government recognizes the critical
importance of the BPS in our community and allocates a relatively high percentage
������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
responsibilities in a satisfactory manner. However, the BPS has had to operate below its
�������������������������������������������������������������������������

The BPS also enjoys the support of the voluntary 70-strong Bermuda Reserve Police
(BRP) which assists with many operational aspects of policing on a part-time basis. The
BPS plays a leadership role in the EMO. This role is detailed later in this Report.

��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������

2012–2015 Strategic Plan, a copy of which can be viewed at www.bermudapoliceservice.
bm.

_Key Performance Indicators_
Commencing in approximately 2001, the BPS established key performance indicators
which have been expanded upon in the years since. Crimes against the person, crimes
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
enforcement activity and the level of public satisfaction are among the current performance
indicators. Performance indicators have been cited by external reviews of the BPS as the
best way to measure the effectiveness of how the organization is achieving its strategic
and operational goals.

_����������������_
1. Over the past several years, budget constraints have resulted in the slight
reduction of policing and training in a number of critically important areas, thereby
������������������������������������������������������������������������������
standards of effectiveness in all areas of policing. In the absence of increasing the
size of the BPS, there are opportunities to use lesser-trained staff for those jobs
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
the Bermuda Reserve Police, the Regiment, private security staff, wardens and/
������������������������������������������������������������������������
enforcement roles currently being performed by the BPS could be considered for
agency transfer, outsourcing and/or further civilianization.

2. While joint BPS and HM Customs operations have been effectively used to convict
many drug importers and conspirators over the years, there is a persuasive
argument that the BPS should relinquish this area of criminal investigations to HM
Customs, as is the case in many overseas jurisdictions. HM Customs acknowledge
its primacy role at the borders, but does not deploy resources in support of that
role nor does it possess an investigative culture or experience required to police the
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
recommendations in this regard are located in the Border Protection section of
this Report.

3. The BPS is making notable progress in dealing with the matter of gangs in Bermuda,
a phenomenon that, if left unchecked, would threaten the peace and security of
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������
with new legislation over the past three to four years, have resulted in a decrease
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������
gang-related murders and other related offences. However, the BPS has much
more to do in the war against gangs in order to protect the community in the
long term. In February 2012, Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC)

NATIONAL SECURITY AND DEFENCE REVIEW 65


-----

published a Report on the BPS in which several probative recommendations were
made on how the BPS focus on serious and organized crime, including gangs,
could be improved.

4. From June 2010, members of the Regiment Boat Troop participated in joint
summer maritime patrols with the BPS in order to augment the declining BPS
Marine Unit strength. There is an opportunity to examine an expanded role for
the Regiment arising from the joint working experiences with the BPS over the
last four summers.

5. Approximately 30% of the BPS is formally trained in Police Support Unit (PSU)
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
are trained to Level 2. PSUs are the primary response contingency to any outbreak
of public disorder—serious or otherwise. The Commissioner acknowledged that in
���������������������������������������������������������������������������������
available for mobilization. Mobilization beyond 72 hours would become extremely
challenging and all existing Internal Security plans call for the support of properly
trained and fully equipped Riot Units of the Bermuda Regiment to support the
BPS.

�� Further, the Commissioner informed the Committee that his ‘number one’
public order concern was the outbreak of armed gang violence on a large scale
�����������������������������������������������������������������������
one of the aims within the BPS’s current Strategic Plan 2012-2015, endorsed
by the Government, is to ‘‘consider options to increase the role of the Bermuda
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������
and contingency capacities”.

�� Other than the Regiment, there are no other trained resources immediately
available to deploy in response to any public order situation.

6. The Committee heard from several presenters, including the BPS, that there was
a highly disjointed approach taken to intelligence gathering, dissemination and
investigative actioning at the national level. The BPS has a robust intelligence
infrastructure within its Intelligence and Tasking Division. Other agencies,
such as HM Customs, Immigration and Corrections, have their own intelligence
infrastructure, personnel and procedures of varying effectiveness. The Committee
was told that critical intelligence reports had been withheld from agencies that
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
The Committee believes that it is altogether unacceptable that an island as small
as Bermuda should have an ineffective intelligence regime.

7. The BPS acknowledged that more work needed to be done on a regulatory
framework for public order events where large numbers of the public congregate

66 GOVERNMENT OF BERMUDA


-----

for sports or entertainment. Recommendations in this regard are made elsewhere
in this Report.

8. The BRP plays an important support role for the BPS. There is an opportunity for
Government to consider an hourly salary system, at a reduced rate from career
������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
routine calls for service and public reassurance patrols. While the cost is less, it
must be noted that there is currently no available funding for this proposal. The
“Reserves option” should also be considered in light of Her Majesty’s Inspectorate
of Constabulary (HMIC) recommendations for PCSOs.

�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
���������������������������������������������������������������������

#### Committee Recommendations

_Continue the implementation of the Report of Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary_
_(HMIC) and other strategic reports on BPS. The BPS is generally regarded in a positive light_
by the people of Bermuda who recognize and respect its primary role in the maintenance
of law and order. The implementation of the HMIC Report and other strategic reports,
including the current anti-gang strategy and current operational policing plans, must be
continued.

_Reallocate the Police Marine Unit to another agency. The Marine Unit of the BPS is an_
area of BPS operations and resources that should be reallocated to another agency or
agencies, including the Regiment, as part of an overall strategy to improve border control
— including the enforcement of marine laws and operational effectiveness.

_Reallocate the Court Liaison Unit. The Court Liaison Unit is another area of BPS_
operations that should be reallocated to another Government Department, the private
sector or a combination of both.

_Reallocate other non-core, non-law enforcement roles. Several other areas of BPS operations_
and resources, including but not limited to explosive ordnance disposal, search and rescue
diving, static guards and vehicle maintenance, should be reallocated to the Regiment or
another Government agency, the private sector or some combination thereof.

_Ensure the Island’s ongoing ability to respond to outbreaks of public disorder. It is_
imperative that the Island’s scaled response (Police followed by Regiment) to outbreaks
of public disorder be preserved. This recommendation is supported by multiple previous
reviews, inspections and reports on the BPS and Regiment since 1977.

_Establish a National Intelligence Agency (exclusive of the Financial Intelligence Agency_
_which is separately legislated). Existing resources and public service personnel can_

NATIONAL SECURITY AND DEFENCE REVIEW 67

be used to create a multi-agency staffed National Intelligence Agency with the focus
of developing an integrated intelligence database, intelligence products and actionable
intelligence to improve investigative quality and services. The Agency’s mandate should

organized criminal enterprises.

_Develop up-to-date criteria for identifying the island’s Key Points to be protected using an_
_internal security situation, a disaster contingency or recovery planning._ The Regiment
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
needs to continue and be expanded to other agencies as appropriate to include the wider
range of threats outlined in this Report.

_Register and license large public events. Large public events like outdoor concerts do_
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
risk to public safety and to those marshalling crowds. The requirement to register
large gatherings and to have effective risk mitigation measures in place prior to the
commencement of events is vital.

_Establish a single emergency call and dispatch centre. Currently, the Island’s emergency_
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
The establishment of a single emergency call centre and uniformed services dispatch
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
improve the situational awareness of separate services for incidents.

#### Department of Corrections

The mandate of the Department of Corrections is “to administer sentences imposed by
the courts under condition of safe custody and well-ordered community life, which is
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
can lead good and useful lives on discharge and to execute such awards of punishment on
persons in custody as may be ordered by the courts or disciplinary authority”.

_Legislated or Main Responsibilities_
The Bermuda Prisons Act 1979 is the primary legislation that governs the correctional
system. However, the Department of Corrections is also guided by various other Acts of
Parliament that speak to the treatment of offenders in Bermuda.

_����������������_
1. The Department of Corrections has an experienced internal emergency response
team that has thwarted the occurrence of any major disturbances since 1996. It
also has a well-developed intelligence sharing structure with the BPS.

2. The Department of Corrections has established an MOU with the Bermuda
Hospitals Board which allows patients to obtain medical services within the

68 GOVERNMENT OF BERMUDA


-----

correctional facilities, thereby reducing inmate external movement and addressing
some security concerns for the community.

3. The correctional facilities are in need of up-to-date surveillance and monitoring
technologies to reduce the introduction of contraband and ongoing criminal activity
within the facilities. Such modernized equipment will also enhance the protection
of the facilities’ perimeters from unauthorized access by land or sea.

4. There does not appear to be an appropriate contingency plan for the relocation
of inmates in the event of an impending disaster. According to legislation, the
Minister responsible for the correctional facilities is authorized to designate a spot
for relocation during an emergency situation. However, such relocation has the
potential to cause harm to inmates or to create unanticipated security concerns.
There is the opportunity for the Department of Corrections to work with the EMO
to develop an effective and appropriate plan for the relocation of inmates in the
event of a natural or man-made disaster.

5. There is the lack of a mandatory comprehensive system of re-education and
rehabilitation.

6. There appears to be an ad hoc approach to security procedures within the
Department of Corrections that cannot address the systemic security issues,
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
of drugs and other contraband into the facilities and ongoing gang rivalries and
activity within the institutions. This situation requires urgent improvement.

#### Committee Recommendations

_Develop and implement the necessary policies and procedures to improve the security_
_of prisons. There appears to be an ad hoc approach to security procedures within the_
Department of Corrections that cannot address the systemic security issues, especially
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
and other contraband into the facilities and ongoing gang rivalries and activity within
the institutions. This situation requires urgent improvement. The Commissioner of
Corrections and his team must develop and implement the necessary policies, procedures,
training and standard operating procedures to improve capabilities and performance in
these areas.

_Procure Adequate Equipment for the Surveillance of Prison Perimeters. Additional_
surveillance equipment must be acquired in order to reduce contraband entering the
correctional facilities.

_Draft Contingency Plans for the Emergency Housing of Prisoners. Corrections authorities_
must draft appropriate contingency plans for the emergency relocation of inmates from

### Emergency Measures and Public Safety

#### Emergencies Measures Organization

The Mission of the EMO is to coordinate the efforts of Government Departments, utility
services and private agencies in protecting and preserving the life of the community
before, during and after severe storms, hurricanes and other critical incidents and to
disseminate information to the public. The BPS plays a major leadership role in the
EMO.

The effectiveness of the EMO is tested regularly. During each hurricane season, the
EMO is routinely deployed for pre-season preparation and when a storm or hurricane is
likely to impact the Island.

�������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
Fabian in 2003, the most serious natural disaster occurrence recorded in several decades.
There was multiple loss of life as warnings on severity were not heeded, more than 2,000
buildings damaged, millions of dollars in marine and property losses, almost total Island
shutdown, temporary airport closure, Causeway destruction, foreign press on the Island,
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
efforts for a sustained period and at least 90% energy disruption.

The EMO has also been called into operation for non-weather events, such as the Belco
�������������������������������������������������� September 2001 terrorist attacks in the
United States when Bermuda had to accommodate nine trans-Atlantic airliners which
were forced to land at short notice. The operation, arguably the largest single EMO event
to date, took a leadership role in requesting the Regiment to protect the airport, other
ports of entry and several KPs in the immediate global-wide fall-out of the attacks.

The Bermuda public continues to look to the BPS, along with the Regiment, for protection
and support during times of emergencies, severe, adverse and damaging weather systems,
other catastrophic events or internal security threats. The resources of the BPS and the
Regiment frequently merge during EMO operations. The EMO has Standard Operating
Procedures embedded within Standing Instructions which are issued annually. When the
EMO functions, the Commissioner of Police assumes the role of Director of Operations.

During the Committee’s review of the EMO and information and context provided by
many agencies that appeared before the Committee, it became apparent that reform is
required in a number of areas.

scenarios. The Emergency Powers Act 1963 is more than 50 years old, is heavily
weighted towards authority vested in the Governor, is designed largely around
severe internal security events and does not provide a modern, scaled approach
with devolved authority and response to events. Further, there are no provisions
for disaster planning at the national level.

2. Legislation which is practical and relevant to current and future national disaster,
defence and security planning and operations is required. The Committee believes
that there is a need to reform and align the Island’s resources during times of
national emergency more effectively. The Committee also believes that there is
a need for legislative authority for these resources and the necessary responses
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������
������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
for planning, public order and safety at large scale events.

������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
Planning structures, some with legislative backing. The Committee therefore has
determined that the Emergency Powers Act 1963 must be updated to make it
more relevant to current needs.

4. There is a necessity for the EMO to broaden its remit to include the formulation
of plans to mitigate the effects of a far broader set of circumstances than currently
covered by the EMO’s Standing Instructions. Operational procedures must be
���������������������������������������������������������������������
��������������������������������������������������������������������������

�� ������������������������������

�� an aircraft incident

�� a large scale explosive substance or propane gas incident

�� large scale and wide spread public disorder

�� ������������������������������������

The proposed NDP and the EMO must collaborate closely in order to ensure this
outcome.

��������������������������������������������������������������������������������
contingency plans existed for the types of scenarios set out in 4. above. Moreover,
the Committee was not convinced that the EMO and the respective lead agencies
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������
effective process should a multi-agency response under an EMO umbrella be
required.

6. There is scope for the EMO to re-examine its Executive and second tier structure to
ensure that all key agencies (such as the Department of Health and the Bermuda
Hospitals Board’s Mass Casualty Response Unit) are appropriately represented to
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������
and increasingly diverse range of potential threats to national security and in the
disaster planning arena, there may very well be other agencies and NGOs worthy
of consideration in this regard.

7. The Committee believes that there are several tactical level issues that should be
confronted and considered by the EMO and NDC, including:

�� Improving the accessibility of public information on ‘how to respond’ in a
critical disaster incident.

�� Establishing and documenting a full network of Emergency Assembly Points
���������������������������������

�� �������������������������������������������������������������������������
audible early warning system to be used in conjunction with other emergency
warning measures in the event of a pending disaster.

#### Committee Recommendations

_����������������������������������������������������The Committee strongly recommends_
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
national security which would be empowered to coordinate and direct the efforts of
Government Departments and external agencies in disaster preparedness, planning and
in the provision of post disaster relief. The work of the NDP, headed by the NDC, would
include building strategic responses and planning across a wide variety of potential
������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
NGOs are involved in the planning and strategy development. The NDC would then be
responsible for ensuring that the Island has a plan of response for each of a wide variety
of possible threats. This recommendation is consistent with the Committee reviews of
numerous overseas jurisdictions which have established security councils in recent years
in response to changing global threats.

_Update the Emergency Powers Act 1963. The Committee recommends that the Emergency_
Powers Act 1963 be updated to make it relevant to current and future national disaster,
defence and security planning and operations. It is the Committee’s view that new
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
for the authorities pre, during and post event and provide for planning, public order and
safety at large scale events.

_Update the EMO mandate and Standing Instructions._ The structure and working

72 GOVERNMENT OF BERMUDA


-----

practices of the EMO must be revised and expanded to include greater emphasis on
disaster preparedness and to develop effective spontaneous reactions to emergencies
other than hurricanes that could occur with almost no notice.

_Review the EMO Executive and second tier structure. It is recommended that the EMO re-_
examine its Executive and second tier structure in order to ensure that all key agencies
(Department of Health, the Bermuda Hospitals Board’s Mass Casualty Response Unit,
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
response will be maximized.

_Establish Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with international agencies. There_
is a need to review and update existing MOUs or to develop MOUs with the relevant
international bodies to ensure rapid response to critical incidents impacting both the
local population and foreign nationals.

_Make provision for the special needs of seniors and vulnerable persons. Bermuda has_
a sizeable population of persons aged 65 and older, many of whom experience varying
levels of health and mobility. Special consideration must be given to the needs and care
for this segment of the population in the event of a national emergency or major critical
incident impacting the Island.

_Develop up-to-date criteria for identifying the Island’s Key Points to be protected during_
_internal security situation, a disaster contingency or recovery planning._ The Regiment
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
needs to continue and be expanded to include the wider range of threats outlined in this
Report.

_Disaster preparedness information must be updated and public education campaigns_
_must be implemented._ There was consensus amongst presenters and a view that was
endorsed by the Committee that Bermuda must prepare best practice publications that
cover all major natural and man-made disasters. These briefs must be made available via
all main broadcast, social media, electronically and in print versions.

_Networks of emergency relief centres must be established. There was widespread support_
amongst a cross-section of stakeholders for PCATs to work closely with medical service
providers, local volunteer relief agencies and charities to establish predetermined
emergency relief centres across the Island.

_Establish a contingency plan for handling mass casualties. The Committee was made_
aware that mass casualty training was undertaken by the KEMH team in conjunction
with other agencies under full live exercise conditions. The Committee was less persuaded
that the Island was equipped to deal with a very large-scale mass casualty event, with
casualties numbering in the hundreds. Appropriate contingency plans and/or MOUs with
external agencies should be seriously considered. In addition, no contingency plan exists
for the provision of life-saving medical supplies in outlying areas in the event that roads
are impassable for vehicles. Relevant contingency plans must be established.

NATIONAL SECURITY AND DEFENCE REVIEW 73


-----

_Improve communications with other emergency organizations. Include KEMH personnel_
in EMO and disaster planning drills. KEMH must be kept abreast of any 911 calls where
the incident has the potential to require medical assistance. Currently, KEMH is not
included in some emergency planning and is caught off guard at times when there are
spikes in emergency registrations caused by incidents about which it has received no
notice.

#### Bermuda Fire and Rescue Service

The responsibilities of the Bermuda Fire and Rescue Service (BFRS) include:

�� �������������������������������������������������������

�� response to emergency medical calls

�� ���������������������������������������������������������

�� �������������������������������������������������������������������������������

�� management of 7,000 annual calls through an Integrated Emergency Dispatch

The main effort of the BFRS is the provision of the above listed services through three
full-time stations and one volunteer station.

_����������������_
1. A review of the BFRS was carried out by Sir Ken Knight, Chief Fire and Rescue
Advisor, UK in 2010. While the 2010 report cited the high level professionalism

The BFRS acknowledged that it was behind schedule with respect to
implementation of the 36 recommendations set out in the 2010 report.

3. In response to ongoing concerns with its recruitment shortfall, the BFRS reported
that it was considering lowering the recruitment requirements. While this
approach may increase the number of successful applicants, it was not clear to the
Committee that this would ensure a high performance level for the BFRS or the
retention of strong recruits.

#### Committee Recommendations

_Implement the recommendations of the Sir Ken Knight 2010 Bermuda Fire Service Report._
BFRS received two independent reports on its capabilities and shortcomings in 2010. The
Sir Ken Knight report made 36 recommendations that would improve the ability of the
BFRS to provide services. The Committee recommends that the BFRS should, in the very
least, make every effort to implement or respond to the recommendations as outlined in
this Report. There should be oversight provided by the Bermuda Fire Services Board
and/or the appropriate Ministry responsible for the BFRS.

The BFRS should also be required to respond to the shortfalls outlined in the ARFF
Audit Report 2010 which provided and in-depth review of the capabilities of the BRFS
LF Wade International Airport Division.

_Address the ongoing personnel shortages within the BFRS. The lack of available manpower_
was pointed out in each of the above-mentioned reports. The Committee understands
that the manpower shortage issues have been an ongoing challenge for the BFRS. The
Committee recommends that the BFRS consider the recommendations of the Sir Ken
Knight 2010 report to overcome the manpower issues by utilizing overseas secondments
(possibly in the short term) and the development of volunteers to compensate for the
shortage of available manpower.

_�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������_
The Committee recommends that the BFRS review the resources that it would require
in the event of a serious incident aboard one of the mega cruise ships that make weekly

#### Department of Works and Engineering

The Department of Works and Engineering, with a total of 349 employees, was allocated
�������������������������������

Under the direction of the Chief Engineer, the Department provides a wide range of
public services in engineering, design, construction, maintenance, operations of public
roads, highways, bridges, water supply, sewage disposal, waste management, street
lighting, building systems, automotive vehicles and equipment as well as management
of the Government Quarry and Asphalt Plant.

The Department has structured its services under the following seven Sections:

�� Highways Section

�� Electrical and Mechanical Engineering Section

�� Quarry Section

�� Structures Section

�� Waste Management Section

�� Water and Wastewater Section

�� Tynes Bay Waste-to-Energy Facility

The Department’s mission is to ensure the effective and prudent management of
all operations and engineering services relating to the construction, erection, improvement,
maintenance and repairs of Government infrastructure.

In the context of the discussion on the safety of Bermuda and its people, the Highways
Section, the Water and Wastewater Section and the Structures Sections are of particular
������������

�� _Highways Section_
The Highways Section is the custodian of all public highways, bridges, docks and
coastline works, along with the management of works for private roads. This
responsibility includes the planning, design, construction and maintenance
of highways. Work also includes re-surfacing roads, signage and markings,
constructing bus shelters and completing other new driveways and parking areas.

76 GOVERNMENT OF BERMUDA


-----

�� _Water and Wastewater Section_
The current Government water supply system produces approximately 200
million gallons of water each year by abstracting from fresh and brackish ground
waters. The Section operates and maintains four water treatment plants at
various locations across Bermuda, abstracting from three lenses for distribution.
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������
reservoirs which hold a total of some 2.5 million gallons, provides potable water
supply to around 850 metered outlets and maintains a septage receiving facility
for waste sludge at Tynes Bay.

�� _Structures Section_
The role of the Structures Section is to provide structural engineering services to
the Ministry of Public Works (Department of Works and Engineering) and other
Government Departments. Its primary function is to ensure that buildings and
structures owned by the Government are constructed and maintained to acceptable
and safe standards. This function includes all bridges, docks and public landing
places outside the City of Hamilton and the Town of St. George. The Section
recommends and implements remedial works to maintain buildings, bridges and
other public-accessed structures in order to ensure that they are safe for public
use.

the competence of supervisors.

3. Department staff play a critically important role in ensuring that roads are safe
and passable as soon as possible following a hurricane or storm. Regiment and
Department of Parks personnel also play a major post-hurricane role in this regard.
It is essential that Works and Engineering, Regiment and Parks personnel work
collaboratively in order to ensure that this most important inter-agency function

4. The Department stores building blocks and tarpaulin to be called upon in order
to repair Government or, in some cases, privately owned buildings if required
following a natural or man-made disaster. The Island’s sole cement-producing
facility is privately owned. There should be in place an agreement between
Government and the cement owners which ensures that concrete supplies are
available should they be required following a hurricane or related disaster.

5. Committee members expressed concern about the lack of security at the Island’s
reservoirs.

6. The Island’s water plants are not automated and rely on personnel to operate
the machinery. During a major hurricane, for example, it may not be possible
for the staff to reach the plants in order to operate them. Currently, there is
no provision for these services to be performed by members of the Regiment or
by representatives of any other agency during times of emergency. It would be
prudent to train uniformed services personnel to carry out these tasks, if required,
during those periods.

7. It was noted that individuals who reside in low-lying areas close to the Island’s
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������
���������������������������������������������������������������������������
in low-lying areas in the event of tsunamis. In this regard, the Committee was
advised that in some countries, the Cook Islands, for example, there were tsunami
warnings (sirens) that directed islanders to follow trails that led to higher and safer
grounds. The Chief Engineer informed the Committee that there was funding in
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������
He said that current data was inadequate, as it had been gathered from a single
survey point. Also, Works and Engineering was in dialogue with BIOS and the
BWS regarding weather buoys and tide gauges to be used for gathering data.

8. The Chief Engineer indicated his Department’s support for a siren or some other
early warning device that would alert Bermuda’s residents should there be an
urgent need to move to higher ground because of imminent storm surge. He
recognized the importance of testing such a device without causing alarm among
Bermuda’s residents.

9. The Committee recognized that mass casualties were likely to occur in the event
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������
the Island. The Island’s response in such situations is addressed elsewhere in the
Report.

10. The Committee agreed that Tynes Bay Waste-to-Energy Facility should be listed
among the Island’s Key Points which required special protection during times of
disaster.

#### Committee Recommendations

_Enhance security at reservoirs. Recognizing the risks associated with contamination of_
the reservoirs, the Committee recommends that immediate attention be given to securing
these facilities.

_Provide training of additional operators of water plants. The Committee, recognizing that_
the Island’s water plants were not automated and that the normal operators might be
prevented from reaching the facilities during a major hurricane, for example, agrees that
Regiment and/or other emergency services’ personnel should be trained to operate the
plants on a stand-by basis.

_Ensure availability of cement supplies during times of disaster. The Committee_
recommends that Government pursue a formal agreement with the owners of the Island’s
sole cement-producing facility that would ensure the immediate availability of concrete
supplies should they be required following a hurricane or major disaster.

_Ensure protection of persons who live on the coastline or in other low-lying areas of Island._
The Committee noted the risks faced during hurricanes by persons who lived close to
the coastline or in other low-lying areas of the Island. The Committee agrees that every
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
would provide up-to-date data on risks associated with living in such areas during times
of tidal surge. The Committee believes that such data would greatly assist the authorities
in ensuring the safety of residents in these areas.

safety of attendees is a major concern to the Department, especially when alcohol
consumption is involved. Only about a dozen Park Rangers, supported by a small

management of events like Beachfest is addressed elsewhere in the Report.

2. In the past, Park Rangers were able to communicate with the BPS via radio.
This means of communication is no longer available as the Park Rangers’ radios
are now incompatible with the updated BPS radios. However, the Department’s
lifeguards do have communication with the Police.

3. Much of the Department’s equipment and a number of its vehicles are unavailable
as they await repairs. In many cases, a lack of available funding leads to the
delay in repairs. The Department is unable to discharge its responsibilities to the
���������������������������������������������������������������������������������
awaiting repairs or replacement.

4. The Department plays an important role in the EMO, particularly post-disaster,
although its Director is not a member of the EMO Executive. Shortages in equipment
and vehicles can impede the Department’s ability to respond as expeditiously and
�������������������������������������������������������������������������

5. When high winds and unusually rough seas occur, in the interest of public safety
the Department advises members of the public that the beaches are unavailable
for use. In these instances, lifeguards are withdrawn from the beaches. There is
a concern, however, that even when the Department has closed the beaches and
withdrawn lifeguard services, some individuals, sports personnel in particular,
venture onto the beaches and into the water. There is an obvious danger in these
circumstances.

#### Committee Recommendation

_Ensure availability of equipment and vehicles during times of disaster. The Committee_
expressed concern that the unavailability of equipment and vehicles as they awaited
repairs or replacement could militate against the Department’s ability to respond as
required during post-disaster clean-up exercises. The Committee recommends that every

ensure that there is an effective enforcement regime in place. In the absence of
the recommended legislation and enforcement regime, a mass casualty incident

4. More focus needs to be placed on the safety and health of the public from
structural, atmosphere, machinery and equipment failure. The following physical
and industrial hazards are of particular concern and require contingency planning
in the event of a potential accident:

�� Bermuda has eight bridges that connect the land mass. Except with
the Causeway following Hurricane Fabian in 2003, there have been no
comprehensive engineering inspections of these bridges in Bermuda for several
years. The only inspections that have been carried out are visual ones that do
not entail any detailed structural analysis. Little documentation, if any, is
produced following those visual inspections. Two bridges that are of particular
concern are the Causeway which connects the airport and St. George’s Parish
to the mainland and which is particularly vulnerable in storm conditions and
the Swing Bridge which is in need of critical remedial work. The resulting
impact of any failure of these two bridges would be the isolation of several
densely populated communities in the St. George’s area which would be

without easy access to an acute care treatment (were the Lamb Foggo Acute
Care Centre to cease operation), substantial provisions of food and water or

contingency plans for emergency supplies.

�� There is potential for the grounding of cruise ships and oil tankers in the North
Channel and the Narrows, particularly the larger mega ships that sail into
Bermuda. There is also the potential for local commuter ferries, which carry
passenger loads from 170 to 300 persons, to collide with objects at relatively
high speeds resulting in sinking or capsizing.

indicated in the TSSA 2005 safety audit.[18]

#### Committee Recommendations

_Strengthen Occupational Safety and Health legislation. Companies that deal in dangerous_
goods or pressurized containers are governed by a self-regulation. Too often, such
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
members of the public are placed at great risk. Many examples of dangerous practices were
cited during the presentation by representatives of the Occupational Safety and Health

### Acute Care and Public Health

#### King Edward VII Memorial Hospital (KEMH)

KEMH is the only acute care hospital in Bermuda. The safety and security of patients and
staff are ongoing concerns at KEMH which must be included in any disaster simulation

exercises to ensure that a coordinated response is provided. Until now, inclusion in
the distribution list for simulation exercises has been inconsistent. KEMH, as the only
hospital on the island, must be able to continue its normal daily business (care for acute
patients outside of the scope of the disaster) even while providing care in a disaster
response. A coordinated response is key to its ability to do so.

_����������������_
1. Lack of coordination with KEMH has resulted in incidences of health protocols not
being followed during simulation exercises. Other agencies often tend to focus only
on their own duties and responsibilities, a situation that can lead to critical health
issues that arise in a disaster scenario being inadvertently overlooked. Ensuring a
coordinated response across all agencies and including KEMH in the planning of
disaster exercises will alleviate this problem. Communication between the EMO
and KEMH is oftentimes less than satisfactory during times of critical incidents,
���������������������������������������������������������������������������������
manner. KEMH must be informed immediately of all events which have an effect
������������������������������������������������������������������������������
Marsh Folly resulted in smoke inhalation through the hospital’s air-conditioning
system and other critical medical issues for some vulnerable patients. That
incident highlights the need for communication between all emergency services
and the hospital.

2. Budgeting concerns led to the BHB decision to close the Lamb Foggo Urgent Care
Centre with effect from 1 December 2013. That decision was put on hold, with a
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
Committee noted that the closure of the Lamb Foggo Urgent Care Centre would
leave a huge gap in emergency services should a disaster occur, especially in the
event of a plane crash at the airport. Additionally, the facility’s closure would
leave a large section of the east end vulnerable in the event of a Causeway closure
due to a hurricane or other disaster.

3. The ability of KEMH to deal with a mass casualty event relies on several resources,
including the availability of facilities, skilled manpower and medical supplies.
Reasonable supplies of consumables are maintained at the hospital. However,
there is need for a contingency plan to provide more bandages, bloods, medicines
and other critical supplies. The hospital currently can treat a half a dozen serious
theatre cases simultaneously and over 100 walking wounded, but the medical
consumables such as bandages, pharmaceuticals and chemicals may well be
exhausted quickly in the event of a mass casualty disaster.

4. In the event of a mass casualty incident at a remote site, KEMH is likely to establish
a hub at the scene to deal with the less serious injuries, with only the most serious
incidents transferred to the hospital for treatment. A large tented area has been
suggested as an option for the on-site treatment of the less serious injuries. A

future. In the interim, additional ambulances have been borrowed from St.
John Ambulance for routine emergency responses. The Committee noted that in

#### Department of Health

The Department of Health is governed by the Public Health Act 1949. It also has various
responsibilities as set out under the Bermuda Hospitals Board Act 1970 and other allied
health legislation. The mission of the Department is to “promote and protect the physical,
mental and social well-being of the community, to enable the Island’s residents to realize
their optimum quality of life.” This mission is achieved through ensuring the following
outcomes:

instead of reactive repairs is needed for medical equipment and facilities to ensure that
emergency services continue to function at optimal capacity during a sustained disaster.

_Develop a plan to promote increased collaboration within the Department of Health. The_
Department of Health has approximately 300 personnel under its remit. However, there

main pillars in its economy — international business and to a much lesser extent,
tourism. Bermuda thrives on its strong commitment to relevant international standards
and its ability to provide services, resources and infrastructure to these two sectors. It
can be said that most other industries in Bermuda support the two key pillars.

Given the delicate nature of Bermuda’s economy, any failure to comply with key
international requirements or any sustained interruption in the ability to provide required
services and infrastructure to these two main sources of income would negatively impact
the Island’s reputation and its ability to support its population.

#### Financial Intelligence Agency (FIA)

The FIA was established by the Financial Intelligence Agency Act 2007 (the “FIA
Act”) to act as an independent agency authorized to receive, gather, store, analyze and
���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
of terrorism received in the form of Suspicious Activity Reports (“SARs”). The Proceeds of
Crime Act 1997 and the Anti-Terrorism (Financial and other Measures) Act 2004 impose
certain reporting obligations on all persons who, as a result of matters encountered in
their business or profession, have suspicions relating to proceeds of criminal conduct or

Subject to the restrictions imposed under the FIA Act, the FIA may disseminate such
information to various domestic and foreign bodies including the BPS, HM Customs

#### Committee Recommendations

_��������������������������������������������������������� The Government must_
������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
maximize the funds received from such assets and to ensure that proceeds are received
by authorities in a timely basis. Reinvesting such funds into initiatives to combat money

#### Information Technology, Data Security and Telecommunications

Existing laws in Bermuda do not adequately address cybercrime. Cyber security has
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
focus on the provision of insurance and reinsurance services. Unauthorized access to
governmental or nongovernmental infrastructures can create a serious threat and have
a negative impact on a country’s political, economic and military security.

_����������������_
1. Bermuda has experienced or has the potential to experience the following types of
cybercrime:

�� Intrusive offences such as illegal access (hacking), data espionage and data
interference.

�� Content-related offences such as spam, child pornography, religious
radicalism and other violence propaganda.

92 GOVERNMENT OF BERMUDA


-----

�� Copyright and trademark related offences such as copyright infringement
and piracy, phishing and cyber-squatting.

�� Computer-related offences such as advance fee fraud, credit card fraud,
internet banking fraud, forgery and identity theft.

�� Combination offences such as cyber-terrorism, cyber-warfare and cyberlaundering.

2. One of the topics raised by telecommunications service providers and the business
community was the growing concern with telecommunications fraud and the
negative effect it can have on businesses domiciled in Bermuda. There are an
estimated 400 different types of fraud permeating the wholesale telecommunications
market.

3. Telecommunications fraud is currently estimated by service providers to cost the
global industry upwards of $40 billion dollars this year.[20] Industry stakeholders
believe that the growing trend is driven by a huge global criminal element that
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
as these scams and schemes have become more sophisticated, the perpetrators’
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������
apprehend.[21]

4. Legislation was suggested whereby telecommunications carriers domiciled and
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������
������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
will provide some level of protection to the people of Bermuda and some level of
protection for both domestic and international businesses domiciled in Bermuda.

#### Committee Recommendations

_Update Bermuda’s current legislation and develop the necessary protocols for international_
_cooperation to enable the Island to address cybercrime effectively._ The increasing
incidences of cybercrime pose a serious threat to Bermuda’s national security. Cybercrime
challenges the effectiveness of laws and law enforcement capabilities globally. Gaps in
current legislation, resources and expertise leave Bermuda susceptible to undetectable
cybercrime and vulnerable to loss of business, data, money and sensitive Government
information.

growing concern with telecommunications fraud and the negative effect it can have on
businesses domiciled in Bermuda. There are an estimated 400 different types of fraud
permeating the wholesale telecommunications market. Telecommunications fraud
is currently estimated by service providers to cost the global industry upwards of $40

carriers domiciled and licensed in Bermuda will not be responsible for any outbound
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
provision will provide some level of protection to the people of Bermuda and some level of
protection for both domestic and international businesses domiciled in Bermuda.

### Environmental Security

#### Energy Security

Belco provides 98.2% of the electrical supply to the Island. Government-operated Tynes
Bay Waste-to-Energy Facility generates approximately 1.8% of the Island’s electrical
supply.

_����������������_
1. �������������������������������������������������������������������������������
introduction of alternative sources of renewable energy is needed as a priority
to diversify the sources of energy for the Island. A sustained interruption to the
power supply resulting from a critical incident impacting the Belco power plant
would severely impact the Island’s ability to conduct its normal business and could
����������������������������������������������������

2. TeleBermuda International Ltd. (TBI) has electrical generating capacity located
in St. David’s to power LF Wade International Airport and St. David’s temporarily
in the event of critical power loss to the Island. An inventory of other various
sources of electrical generating capacity in the event of critical power loss to the
Island is required.

3. COMOPS and emergency bunkers must have enhancements with regard to
maintaining a mechanism for independent supply in the event of catastrophic loss
of electrical power. Additionally, a prioritization plan for Government Departments
must be developed to ensure continuity of service.

#### Committee Recommendations

_Establish alternative energy sources. Bermuda must actively promote the continued_
development of the use of alternative sources of renewable energy such as solar power for
both business and individual households to diversify the sources of energy for the Island.
Legislation should be established to require Belco to purchase the excess electricity

generated from solar panels from individual companies and households. This provision
will encourage the Island’s transition from absolute dependency on a single source for
energy.

_Diversify the current single generating capability across multiple locations. Belco has_
considered the feasibility of locating its generating capacity across several locations on
the Island in the event that the St. John’s Road plant experiences catastrophic failure.
This alternative arrangement should be explored.

#### Food Security

It is important for Bermuda to reduce its reliance on overseas import of food and to
implement the necessary reforms to increase its local food supply. With 64,237 people
living on 20.5 square miles, Bermuda is one of the most densely populated countries
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
food locally to feed the population. Any unforeseen disruption to the food supply poses
������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
public unrest. It also has the potential to impact Bermuda’s reputation as a socially and
economically stable jurisdiction.

_����������������_
1. Various estimates suggest that Bermuda has the capacity to produce from 15% to
25% of its food supply with the remaining portion of food being imported primarily
from the United States.[23]

2. It is estimated that the amount of food produced available on Island at any given
time can feed the population for approximately three to four weeks at the current

2001 saw the closure of all US ports for approximately ten days. A subsequent
port closure occurred in 2012 in New York in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.

Bermuda primarily due to panic buying and food hoarding.[24]

_Improve the administrative and legal framework for local agriculture and encourage the_
_development of innovative agricultural practices. Improvements in the administrative_
and legal framework for agriculture could mitigate risks to food security, assist in
the sustainable development of agriculture and potentially provide employment for
Bermudians through modernization of farming techniques and the provision and
protection of incentives to encourage the full utilization of arable farmland. Create and/
or enforce legislation to ensure that all existing arable land is protected against change
of use.

_Develop a plan for emergency food distribution. Contingency plans must be developed_
with food importers and retailers for administrative oversight for the sourcing and
disbursement of emergency food supplies if needed in the event of a sustained interruption
of food imports to the Island resulting from a local or international disaster.

#### Bermuda Weather Service

Bermuda Weather Service (BWS) is operated by BAS-Serco Ltd., a joint venture between
the local company, Bermuda Aviation Services (BAS), and the international outsourcing
company, Serco, under a contract with the Department of Airport Operations (DAO) at
LF Wade International Airport. BWS has operated as a national weather service since
1995 to provide weather information for the DAO following the withdrawal of the US
Navy from Bermuda.

_����������������_
1. It was assumed prior to reviewing the BWS that the organization was contracted

96 GOVERNMENT OF BERMUDA


-----

to provide weather advice to the Government as a whole. This is not the case and
no such formal contract exists for key elements of a national weather service. The
fact that the BWS is only contracted by the DAO and is under no obligation to
share its data and analysis with the wider country is a major concern.

2. Failure of critical severe weather monitoring equipment and the lack of back-up
equipment are major concerns also. The Doppler radar, installed in 2005, is a very
complex piece of equipment which is run continuously in Bermuda’s salt corrosive
environment. Despite some commonly used spare parts in stock, not all parts for
this equipment are available in Bermuda and must be sourced from overseas, a
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
work. Additionally, the expertise for more complex repairs is provided from abroad
and the availability of a repair technician depends on the manufacturer’s schedule
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������
of this situation was recently seen when the Doppler radar was inoperable in
August and early September 2013, the height of Bermuda’s hurricane season. In
fact, the radar system was repaired only days before Tropical Storm Gabrielle hit
the Island; fortunately, BAS-Serco was able to increase the priority of the task
with the manufacturer who had earlier indicated that its repair technician would
not be available to carry out the repairs until December 2013.

3. There is currently no early warning system[25] to warn Bermuda’s residents of an
impending short notice weather disaster or other emergencies. Currently, the
Island relies on a call to the EMO command centre and posting the information on
the BWS website for warning of such events. Neither of these warning strategies
will reach the member of the public if they are not keeping a constant watch
on the BWS website. Moreover, during silent hours, those sleeping would be
completely unaware of approaching severe weather. Consideration must be given
to the endorsement of a scripted warning along with an audible warning system
throughout the Island and a plan to educate the public on actions to be taken in
the event of such an emergency.

4. The absence of formal warning systems, emergency communication protocols and
public education safety campaigns for sudden pending disasters also render the
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������
Committee was informed that most of the population does not consider ocean
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������
may be attributable to a lack of local expertise in physical oceanography and/
seismology and the fact that most local residents are not aware that in 1929 a
tsunami was spawned off the Grand Banks near Newfoundland.[26]

25 Thirty-two countries participated in a full-scale tsunami alert exercise in the Caribbean on 20 March 2013. The goal was to
test the reaction capacity in countries of the Caribbean and adjacent regions, including the East Coast of Canada and the United
States, the Gulf of Mexico and Bermuda. The exercise was organized under the auspices of UNESCO’s Intergovernmental
Oceanographic Commission (IOC).

26The Royal Gazette article, 21 November 1929.

NATIONAL SECURITY AND DEFENCE REVIEW 97


-----

It is worth noting that even a relatively small tsunami of less than one metre
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������
infrastructure and lead to loss of life due to dangerous currents. This scenario is
particularly relevant to Bermuda, given the increased seismic activity in recent
years off the north coast of Puerto Rico to the south of the Island, the orientation
and popularity of Bermuda’s south shore beaches and the high population density
and structural development along Bermuda’s coastline and low-lying areas that
have occurred since 1929.[27] In the event of an approaching tsunami, residents
would have no more than 30 to 40 minutes in which to secure refuge on higher
ground inland.

5. ������������������������������������������������������������������������������
predictions from model and satellite data. A series of buoys strategically located
around Bermuda’s open waters would provide more accurate wave height
predictions. The availability of accurate information in this regard could prove to
be useful during hurricane forecasting for storm surge warnings and for relocating
people from low-lying areas.

6. When a hurricane moves towards Bermuda, it produces a collective anticipation
of the event amongst residents. If the system then stalls short of the Island, there
is a tendency for the population to underestimate the impending impact of the
severe weather and to become almost dismissive of it. This response to a stalling
hurricane is very dangerous and the public must be educated to guard against
complacency in the event of such occurrence.

7. More public education also is needed to reduce public reliance on the predicted
strength of approaching hurricanes. Many of these systems are hybrid systems,
that is, combined hurricanes and tornados. These hybrid storm systems can
conceivably result in a hybrid Category One hurricane causing more damage, even
resulting in injury or death, than a non-hybrid Category Four hurricane.

#### Committee Recommendations

_Establish a National Weather Service._ ��������������������������������������������
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
since the closure of the US base in 1995. There is a need for the Government to formalize
an agreement with a private entity for provision of weather service products or to establish
“in house” weather forecasting and reporting mechanisms.

_Install a backup Doppler Radar System. BWS should have a back-up Doppler system_
installed in the event of failure of the current system. A less expensive and less complex
system should be purchased to provide continuity of basic prediction services if and when
the current system fails.

_Establish an Early Alert System (EAS).[28] The Committee invites the authorities to_
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
warning system to be used in conjunction with any emergency response to prepare the
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
concerns expressed by presenters that the Island was not currently well served in terms
of warnings for unexpected disaster such as a tsunami or other severe threats that could
occur at almost no notice. In these circumstances, there was the suggestion that an audible
air warning system (air-raid type sirens strategically placed throughout the Island, for
example) could be used as a cost-effective means to signal an alert which would trigger
the public to monitor emergency broadcasts over a range of media.

### Conclusion

The National Security and Defence Review Committee considers it a privilege to have
been invited by His Excellency the Governor, Mr. George Fergusson, and the Premier of
Bermuda, the Hon. L. Craig Cannonier, JP, MP, to undertake this fundamental review
of Bermuda’s security needs, to assess the resources needed to meet those needs and to
develop recommendations in respect of the structure and organization required.

The Report which we have pleasure in presenting to the Governor and to the Premier
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
where those assets need to be enhanced and makes a series of recommendations aimed
at ensuring that those who live in Bermuda are safe and secure.

As evidenced by the comprehensive nature of the Report, our review of the Island’s
security assets, needs and requirements addressed the more obvious and established
security assets such as the Bermuda Regiment and the Bermuda Police Service. It also
addressed agencies dealing with border control and protection, the health and safety of
residents and concerns related to economic, environmental and food security.

In presentations made to the Committee, both in writing and/or in person, we discovered
that security concerns touched upon a wide variety of other related issues and topics such as
the post-conscription operation of the Regiment, the structure of the Emergency Measures
Organization, food security, the oft-cited need for a National Disaster Coordinator and
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
contingency plans in the event that the Island is impacted by a catastrophic hurricane,
storm or tsunami, the potential impact of cybercrime and other such risks on Bermuda’s
economic well-being and stability and the need to ensure that Bermuda’s Key Point
facilities are safe and secure.

28EAS is the term that the International Early Warning Programme coordinated by the United Nations uses for all systems that
are used to send emergency population warnings. EAS is often activated when an unpredicted emergency such as a tsunami,
tornado, earthquake, or other natural disasters occur. The vast majority of EAS alerts are generated by the National Weather
Service. Source: Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

While some of the recommendations contained in the Report can possibly be addressed
internally by many of the organizations and entities concerned using available resources,
it is apparent to the Committee that some of its recommendations and proposed solutions

It would be the Committee’s earnest hope that addressing the Report’s recommendations
on how to move “Towards A More Secure Bermuda” will not be viewed through the prism
of cost alone, as important a consideration as that may be, but in the light of what is
reasonably and sensibly required to ensure that Bermuda is as secure and safe a society

Economic, Sociological, Technological, Legal and Environmental) analysis technique.[29]
This audit examined Bermuda’s infrastructure and its resident population in order to
assist in understanding its ability to deal with a range of national crises. The PESTLE
analysis served to identify the range of threats to be considered and the potential impact

in the face of potential crises or major changes, taking into consideration the macro
and meso circumstances that impact the entity. In the context of Bermuda, macro
circumstances can include size, climate, geographical location, political dependency,
global economic circumstances etc. that potentially impact the security or well-being of
the population, but over which there is no degree of control. Meso circumstances can
include the country’s internal social, political, legal and economic framework and other
decision-making processes over which there is some degree of control. By understanding
both the macro factors (what we cannot control) and meso factors (what we can control), it
is possible to provide an analytical framework to contextualize issues raised with respect
to Bermuda’s security and defence and to identify ways whereby opportunities might be
maximized and threats mitigated.

Consideration of the factors contained in the PESTLE analysis is essential when a
���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
possible solutions without this vital context greatly reduces the possibility of maximizing
opportunities and minimizing threats. It must also be recognized that there are some
circumstances that make an impact over which there is some degree of control and some
circumstances which make an impact, but which cannot be controlled.

NATIONAL SECURITY AND DEFENCE REVIEW 109


-----

Bermuda is a highly autonomous self-governing UK Overseas Territory with a politically
stable infrastructure. There are two political parties currently. Since enactment of its
Constitution (Bermuda Constitution Order 1968), General Elections have been held on a
routine basis with no requirement of any intervention by external parties.

The UK is responsible for Bermuda’s internal security and national defence. Bermuda is
not involved in any international or jurisdictional disputes. Public disorder on the scale of
widespread rioting has been rare, with the last riot occurring in 1977. Subsequent political
and social reforms, the increasing prominence of pressure groups and a transparent
election process have contributed to Bermuda’s political stability.

Bermuda maintains a battalion of approximately 380 paid part-time local conscripts
and volunteers and full-time staff. The role of the Bermuda Regiment is primarily for
maintaining civil order during public uprisings and provision of support during critical
incidents and natural disasters. The Regiment also performs a ceremonial role during
national events, including the Convening of the Legislature and major parades.

The Government has announced its intention to end conscription. At the time of writing,
the Defence Act 1965 remains intact and conscription is still used to maintain the
Regiment’s strength. However, consideration will have to be given to the structure and
responsibilities of a post-conscription military presence on the Island.

Economic Overview
_The PESTLE economic analysis for Bermuda includes an overview of its GDP, currency_
_and economic conditions, revenue sources, aspects of its internal and external trade and_
_its transport infrastructure._

Despite four years of recession and a public debt of $1.4 billion, Bermuda enjoys the
fourth highest per capita income in the world, about 70% higher than that of the US.
However, Bermuda has no major manufacturing or exports and its economy is primarily
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
to a lesser extent, tourism, two industries that are sensitive to internal and external
factors that impact Bermuda’s reputation as an economically stable and safe jurisdiction.

A number of reinsurance companies were formed in Bermuda following the 11 September
2001 terrorist attacks on the US and again after Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma
in 2005, contributing to the expansion of an already robust international business sector.

Bermuda’s tourism industry, which derives over 80% of its visitors from the US, continues
to struggle and has dropped in its relevant importance to the economy. However, it
remains critically important as a job creator.

small and agriculture is limited due to the small size of the Island. A 2010 report suggested
that were Bermuda to rely on local arable land to provide food for the population, the
available land could support only 10,000 people, approximately 15% of the population, at
any given point in time.[30]

Bermuda’s transport infrastructure is generally sound, providing good access to and
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
main sea ports: Hamilton which services smaller cruise ships and container ships which
���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
private sailing vessels, smaller cruise ships and accommodates bulk vessels delivering
aggregate for asphalt production; and Heritage Wharf, Dockyard which can accommodate
mega cruise ships.

There are approximately 447 kilometres (278 miles) of paved roads in Bermuda — 225
kilometres (140 miles) of public roads and 222 kilometres (138 miles) of private roads. The
land mass is composed of a system of smaller islands that are joined by bridges. There is
the potential for disruption to smooth passage to all areas of the Island if these bridges
become damaged or impassable for any reason. The most strategically important bridge
is the 800 metres (approximately 875 yards) long Causeway which provides the only link
between St. David’s, St. George’s (where the airport is located) and the mainland.

Bermuda spends approximately 2.6% of its GDP on education. The literacy rate for
Bermuda is 98%. Twenty-three per cent of the population have completed technical,
vocational or two years of college and 29% have completed four or more years of college or
university education (2010 census). Some 54,000 persons in a population of 64,867 have
access to the internet.

The national unemployment rate as of the last census was approximately 6% overall, but
is believed to be higher currently.

Technological Overview
_The PESTLE technological analysis for Bermuda includes its communications and_
_telecommunications network and its sources of energy._

Bermuda’s communications network is extensive, with nearly 58,000 telephone landlines
in use. There are approximately 88,200 cellular telephones in use on the Island. There
are three local non-cable television stations and approximately 13 local radio stations
operating. The Island also has extensive cable and satellite subscription services available.
There are over 20,000 computers in Bermuda connected to the internet.

Following its enactment, the Bermuda Constitution Order 1968 was amended as follows:

2. 1979 — to give non-Bermudians who were Commonwealth Citizens the right to
vote
3. 1989 — to allow the Governor, with prior approval of the UK Government and upon
consultation with the Premier, to delegate in writing to a Government Minister

Bermuda’s system is based on English common law and there is universal adult suffrage.
The age of majority is 18.

The Head of State is Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II who is represented in Bermuda by

are elected by popular vote to the House of Assembly and appointed to the Senate.

The Government is headed by a Premier who is an elected Member of the House
of Assembly and a Cabinet which is nominated by the Premier and appointed by the
Governor.

The Court system consists of the Magistrates’ Court, the Supreme Court, the Court of
Appeal and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the United Kingdom (UK).

Environmental Overview
_The PESTLE environmental analysis for Bermuda includes an overview of the Island’s_
_geographical coordinates, geography, climate, natural resources, physical hazards and_
_surrounding waters._

Bermuda is a geographically isolated island located 32 degrees 15' (minutes) North and
64 degrees 51' (minutes) West. It has a land mass of approximately 54 square kilometres

[approximately 21 square miles]. The closest land mass to the Island is Cape Hatteras,
North Carolina, approximately 1,071 kilometres (665 miles) WNW of the Island.

Bermuda experiences ample rainfall, but has no fresh water lakes or rivers. Water is
primarily collected via the rooftops of individual households while alternative sources of
fresh water are secured from subterranean water lens through private wells or commercial
water retrieval systems. Desalinized water is also available.

Hurricanes are the most prevalent natural hazards experienced in Bermuda where
the terrain consists of low hills separated by fertile depressions. The lowest points are
the Atlantic Ocean while the highest point on the Island is Town Hill, Smith’s with an
elevation of 76 metres. Storm surges render the Island’s low-lying areas particularly
vulnerable during hurricanes. Approximately 85% of the Island is developed; therefore,

the population density is high. The Island’s electrical and communication networks are
susceptible to high winds and storm conditions.

Bermuda’s Territorial Sea includes waters within a 12 nautical mile radius and an
Exclusive Economic Zone, prescribed by the United Nations Convention on the Law of
the Sea, covering a radius of 200 nautical miles and inclusive of all marine resources,
including energy produced by wind and water.
