# Introduction On the basis of the assessment of the current military strategic environment, defence policy of the country, new missions and requirements to the Armed Forces as well as the resource capabilities of the country, the Military Strategy of the Republic of Bulgaria defines the main rules, principles, forms, and methods of training, employment and management of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria as well as the approaches applied for their organizational and structural building.  The Military Strategy of the Republic of Bulgaria has been developed in accordance with the requirements of the Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria, the Law on Defence and the Armed Forces, the Strategy for Development and Rearmament of the Bulgarian Army, the Concept for Civil Resources Planning to the Interest of Defence, and is based on the approved fundamental documents for the national security –the National Security Concept and the Military Doctrine. The Annual Reports on the Status of National Security are taken into consideration also.  The principles, forms, and methods of employment of the Armed Forces as well as their building and development are oriented towards the current geopolitical realities. They correspond to the changes of the military strategic environment. They take into account the new capabilities of the enhanced integration and cooperation, and the increased capabilities of the international community to deal with crises.  The structure and combat potential of the Armed Forces depend on the capabilities of the national economy to satisfy their needs. All difficulties that the country has to overcome in a period of transition and related resource limitations have their influence on the status of the Armed Forces.  Thе Military Strategy reflects the current stage of the development of the Armed Forces. It is not a dogma and it will develop, mature and enrich in accordance with the conditions of the strategic military environment.  As a result of the ongoing changes, the Armed Forces keep their readiness to provide reliable defence of the country and will move to a new qualitative status that will ensure equal partnership in the Euro-Atlantic Security and Defence Systems. 

 1. Military Strategic Environment

 1.1. New Realities, Risks, and Challenges On a worldwide scale there are processes of global restructuring of the international political and economic relations. This causes both positive trends and new challenges and risks.  The positive trends in the international relations dominate. The confidence and cooperation develop, the processes of European and Euro-Atlantic integration enhance and deepen. Peace and security consolidate. The capabilities


-----

# for crisis management and conflict prevention increase. That increases the level of international and regional security as well as the security of the individual countries. The level of global conflict threat is low and does not endanger peace in the world.  On the background of these positive processes, the risks of internal crises and destabilization of individual countries and regions increased. New non- traditional risks and asymmetric threats appeared and from potential they turned into a real threat. Of special importance are such risks for security like the international terrorism, organized crime, ethnic and religious contradictions, illegal proliferation of weapons and technologies for their production, refugee and emigration problems, threats for the information systems, traffic of drugs and people, ecological threats, natural disasters, large industrial damages and catastrophes, transborder transfer of infectious and epidemic contaminations and toxic pollutions, increased needs of energy, water and other resources.  There is a trend of redistribution of spheres of political and economic influence. In parallel with the formation of regions, powerful politically and economically, new regions with unstable political-social and military-strategic environment and low level of economic development were formed. The big differences in the life standard created preconditions for social tension and discontent in the less developed countries. These circumstances strengthened additionally by the increased role of the religious and the ethnic factor.  The terrorist attacks against the United States contributed to the formation of a new military strategic environment. The previous risks and potential threats of terrorist activities became a reality. They were activated to the level of a terrorist war. The war against terrorism became of paramount importance in the whole world.  The integration processes in Europe deepen and that is materialized in the creation of a new institutional mechanism of the European Union. A new common political, economic, social and legal area is created together with a common area for security and defence. There is a consensus about the necessity of a common European policy for security and defence, including the European military capabilities, preserving the Euro-Atlantic link and the interaction between the European Union and NATO.  The processes in South Eastern Europe influence most directly the status of national security from the international political point of view. The participation of Bulgaria in the peacekeeping forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Kosovo is a proof for the stabilizing role that our country plays in the region. The NATO South Eastern Europe Initiative supports the cooperation between the countries in the region on the basis of the European and Euro-Atlantic values and principles and contributes to the realization of cooperation projects in the area of security and defence. The Process of South Eastern Defence Ministerial Meetings has also a significant role for strengthening the regional stability and security and for the enhancement of the military-political confidence and


-----

# military cooperation in the region. The establishment of the Multinational Peace Force South Eastern Europe (MPFSEE) and the Bulgarian support as host nation to the MPFSEE HQ contributes to the crisis prevention and peace support in South Eastern Europe (SEE). The BLACKSEAFOR contributes to the development of cooperation with a practical focus on conduct of humanitarian operations. The Stability Pact in SEE has a potential to perform coordinating functions on issues, important for the whole region, that are related to the consolidation of peace, democracy, cooperation and economic development.  Together with the positive trends, there are potential risks for the stability in the region. The instability in the Western Balkans and mainly the consequences from the crises in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in Kosovo, and The Republic of Macedonia continue to be a source for the main challenges to the national security of the Republic of Bulgaria.  The illegal proliferation of conventional light weapons to paramilitary ethnic, religious or criminal groups is a reason for a complex change of the forces balance that is a precondition for conflicts.  The existing sources of tension caused the intervention of the international community, the conduct of peacekeeping operations in proximity of the territory of our country with the participation of significant contingents of multinational military forces that will obviously stay in the region for a long period of time.  In our country the democratic institutions are consolidated with stable political government, democratic control over the military and continuously improving civil-military relations. There is an undoubted and solid political and public consensus about the integration of Bulgaria in NATO and the European Union.  The process of economic stabilization is steady and creates the necessary preconditions for a real long term planning and management of the radical reforms in all spheres of the social and economic life, including the Armed Forces. Together with the positive economic development of the country, the capabilities of the military budget to support and meet the requirements of the Armed Forces grow up.  In a period of radical changes in the political, economic and social spheres of life in the society, the Armed Forces maintain their high credit of confidence in the society. Social factors like unemployment, corruption, crime, drugs, getting away from some national values and traditions, educational system difficulties, and insufficient popularity of the military service have a negative effect on the status of the Armed Forces.  The potential threat of arise of social tension, including areas where a population with different ethnic background lives, also impacts negatively this status.  Potential national and transborder dangers of pollution may become a reason for ecological risks. Ineffective and old industrial plants may cause accidents with dangerous consequences for the population and environment.

# The Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria are in a process of reform that is being conducted according to the new political, military strategic, economic and social realities with the purpose of establishment of combat-effective formations capable to accomplish the whole spectrum of traditional and new functions and tasks. The defence planning system of the country practically integrates with the NATO defence planning system within the framework of the Partnership for Peace Initiative, the PfP Defence Planning and Review Process and the Membership Action Plan.  The main risks and challenges to the security of the Republic of Bulgaria caused by the new realities are related to: 
 - the political, economic and military instability of some countries in the region of SEE; 
 - the ethnic and religious contradictions in some parts of the Western Balkans; 
 - some territorial and border disputes in the region; 
 - specific risks and non-traditional challenges to the security like:  -- the international organized crime;  -- the international terrorism;  -- the illegal traffic of drugs, weapons and chemical materials;  -- the ecological transborder and national problems.  Under the circumstances of the new realities after 11 thSeptember 2001 as a main priority comes the fight against organized crime which is closely connected with terrorism, the illegal trafficking of weapons, drugs and people, the weapons of mass destruction proliferation as well as the non-traditional risks related to natural and ecological disasters.  There are preconditions for some potential threats of political, economic, information and humanitarian nature like: 
 - transfer of terrorist activities of foreign extremists on the territory of Bulgaria; 
 - provocation of anti-Bulgarian feelings among the population of neighbouring countries; 
 - attempts for illegal smuggling of weapons and military materials through the territory of Bulgaria; 
 - possible refugees flow as a result of conflicts in proximity to our state border; 
 - increase of the attempts for illegal emigration; 
 - creation of a false impression that there is ethnic tension in the regions with population with different ethnic background; 
 - increase of the losses for the national economy due to the general economic instability of the region; 
 - limitation of the foreign investments; 
 - the information risks and threats related to the transition to a new information society.

# 1.2. The Factor “Military Power” in the International Relations The military power retains its purpose to serve as an instrument for achievement of political goals and interests. At the same time, in the beginning of the XXI century, it might be very often an additional component of a thorough politico-military crisis that includes economic, political, cultural, information, military and other influences and pressure. The Military Strategy of the Republic of Bulgaria allows arise and conduct of the following military conflicts in the world: 
 - global war; 
 - regional conflict; 
 - bilateral conflict; 
 - internal national conflict.  The global war is least probable to arise because the issues of minimum nuclear deterrence and maximum strategic partnership will be essential during the next decades. The Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria may be involved in a global conflict if the country becomes a member of a military political alliance. Whether it participates in such a conflict or not, the country will suffer all the fatal consequences from it.  Regional conflicts are with a higher probability to arise. They are related to the challenge of individual countries (“regional powers”) to change the regional political, economic, ethno-religious and military status quo by using or threatening to use Armed Forces, including a limited use of specific unconventional weapons. The option that our country might be involved in such conflict should not be excluded.  Bilateral conflicts are also with a higher probability to arise. Together with the traditional military actions, they will include also various forms of terrorism that do not exclude the use of specific unconventional weapons. The Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria will take part in a bilateral military conflict if the country suffers aggression by another country.  Internal national (social) conflict is with higher probability to arise in the countries with deep social-economic and ethno-religious problems. The internal national or social conflicts are more probable and will dominate during the next years. Their main sources are belligerent political, ethnic and religious identities. The Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria may be involved in such conflict on the territory of another country only if is a member of a military political alliance and fulfill obligations to an international treaty. Internal national conflict, even with a minimum probability, might be provoked also on the territory of Bulgaria. When “state of emergency” is declared, the Armed Forces may accomplish tasks supporting the public order and security authorities in their actions against the proliferation and traffic of weapons, terrorist actions and security of strategic sites.

# 1.3. The Republic of Bulgaria and NATO The accession of Bulgaria to NATO is the most important direct priority of the foreign policy of the country. Politically, the Bulgarian NATO membership is a confirmation of the European integration logics and a question of participation in the most dynamic and fundamental process in the field of the Euro-Atlantic security.  From political point of view the accession of Bulgaria to NATO means irreversible return of the country to the common European field of democracy, guarantee of the principles of democracy, the rule of law and existence of market economy, upon which the contemporary Bulgarian state is being built as well as sharing the common values and responsibilities within the most powerful and successful politico-military Alliance.  Bulgaria should become a full NATO member without any conditions and limitations for the very reason of the complex strategic situation in the region. The integration of Bulgaria in the common Euro-Atlantic structures is a way to avoid a possible negative challenge to the country’s own defensive capabilities, to the reliability of the strategic partners and to the European security system. The accession of Bulgaria to NATO will considerably enhance security and stability in the region.  The specified four-lateral dialog between Bulgaria, Romania, Greece and Turkey has a particular meaning for precipitation of process of integration of Bulgaria in NATO and contributes for national and regional political and defence cooperation and for NATO south wing consolidation. 

 1.4. Conclusions:  Based on the analysis of the military strategic environment, the following conclusions could be made in the area of the national interests of the Republic of Bulgaria:  1. A decisive factor for the creation of stability and security in the country and the region is the economic prosperity, the development of the democratic processes and the integration in NATO and EU.  2. The processes going on in the Western Balkans and the danger of terrorist actions create conditions for insecurity in the region. They lead to economic losses, slow down of the development pace, retention of the economic and social differences between the countries, delay of the establishment of common security structures, creation of conditions for extremism, terrorism and intensification of their relations with the organized crime.  3. The situation westwards close to the Bulgarian borders will continue to be a source of threats to the regional and national security. The conflicts in the region of the Western Balkans are not traditional military conflicts, there is no direct conflict between large military forces but these are actions with the use of non-traditional means and asymmetric threats to which it is difficult to


-----

# counteract effectively by an armed force acting in the standard way and using standard methods to conduct operations.  4. The risks indicated above have not grown into a direct and immediate threat to the security of the Republic of Bulgaria but they engage considerable international and national resources, impede from implementing projects of different nature (economic, infrastructure, communications, security, etc.) that are of interest to our country and hold back the economic and political development of the region.  5. The situation requires close and constant surveillance and readiness for adequate response to its dynamic changes since there could be serious consequences for the stability in the region.  6. The lessons learnt from the conflicts in the Western Balkans show that it is necessary for crisis management to effectively apply a system of principles, requirements, rules and activities to support the command and control authorities in the process of their prognostication, prevention and control. It is of utmost importance to solve the critical situation or crisis before it expands to the size of a threat to the national security.  7. The timely preparation for participation in the crisis management system requires: 
 - complete information about the situation; 
 - prognosis and analysis of the risks and dangers; 
 - establishment of an early warning system; 
 - planning, co-ordination and preparation of forces and assets and maintaining readiness for adequate response.  8. The reform of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria, the optimization of their composition through a new role, functions, missions and structures is a decisive factor for guaranteeing the national security and their integration in the NATO military structures. The increased capabilities of the international security system, when there is no direct and immediate threat, favour the accomplishment of the reform. 

 2. Fundamentals of the Military Strategy At the root of the military strategy are the vital and strategic interests of the country as defined in the Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria, the National Security Concept and the Military Doctrine.  The main purpose of the defensive policy of the Republic of Bulgaria is the creation and maintenance of a defensive potential capable of neutralizing military threats, providing a reliable defence to the population, sites, territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country.  Military security is a status of the military political and military strategic situation for the Republic of Bulgaria when: 
 - there is no military threat; 
 - the military threat is successfully neutralized; 


-----

# the armed attack is reliably stopped.  Military security rests upon stable economy, well-developed infrastructure and ensured social sphere. The maintenance of a real military potential that could effectively counteract any kind of military and other threats of aggression is an important factor for safeguarding the security of the country.  The military security is achieved through active forming of a favourable international environment that excludes emergence of a military political crisis against the country. Should such crisis arises it could be reliably put under control, including by use of military force; defence of the country; creation and maintenance of sufficient military potential. The Military Strategy serves to support and realize the military security objectives.  The Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria should be capable to deter a possible aggressor who could threaten with military force the security of the Bulgarian state; at the same time at the political level the international organizations and security structures should be referred to in order to assist for conflict prevention.  The Military Strategy of the Republic of Bulgaria has adistinctdefensive character. The Armed Forces and the whole defensive potential will only be used in case of an aggression against the country. At the same time the Military Strategyis based on the principles of corporation, military co-operation, involvement of strategic allies, response to a wide range of possible threats equivalent to the degree of danger of military actions and constant development of the strategic concepts for employment of the Armed Forces and for solution of the issues of the military security of the country.  The Military Strategy includes the following guiding strategic principles: 
 - permanent defensive capability – it presumes maintenance of sufficient defensive potential ready to effectively stop the threats and risks in the military security area; 
 - integration capability – preparation of the country’s defence and Armed Forces for acceleration of the process of integration in the Euro-Atlantic and European military structures; 
 - operational partnership – enlargement of the bilateral and multilateral partnership with the Armed Forces of the neighbour and other countries for execution of humanitarian, peacemaking and other missions in the region and over the world; 
 - modernization and restructuring of the Armed Forces in accordance with the constitutional requirements on their function.  Main area of the building and development of the Bulgarian Army is the formation of effective, module, compact, maneuver, combat-effective, relatively autonomous and thoroughly supported structures, capable to provide the defence of the country and to be an equal partner in the international military organizations and peace support initiatives. 


-----

# The reform of the Bulgarian Army is implemented in stages and as a result of the accomplishment of the scheduled changes the Armed Forces should meet the following basic requirements: 
 - well-trained and motivated for action personnel; 
 - combat-effective and well-trained peacetime formations; 
 - operational and reliable command and control; 
 - reliable information support; 
 - steady, mobile, effective and autonomous formations and groupings; 
 - flexible structures and optimal proportion between the services of the Armed Forces, branches of forces and special forces; 
 - appropriate location correspondent to the existing infrastructure; 
 - modern armament and combat equipment; 
 - technological and doctrinal compatibility between the services of the Armed Forces as well as with the NATO forces.  For the purposes of country’s defence, support to the population, support to peace and security, and the participation in military political crises management, the Armed Forces are being trained for joint military operations and operations other than war with a high level of interoperability. 

 3. Areas and Methodology of Implementation of the Strategy

 3.1. Defence of the Country The defence of the Republic of Bulgaria is accomplished by its Armed Forces through pursuit of information superiority, control and safeguarding the airspace and sea areas and defensive operation in a threatened theatre.  The Armed Forces accomplish their missions either on their own or within the structure of multinational (coalition) forces in accordance with the national legislation of the Republic of Bulgaria and the international treaties to which it is a party. The Armed Forces are established with a capability of defence in one theatre.  The defence of the country is ensured through building and maintenance of a defensive potential and integrated defence planning in cooperation with NATO. The defensive potential includes: military potential; territory and population prepared for defence; economy producing the necessary material resources.  The defence is realized by the Armed Forces, state authorities, local government and administration authorities, organizations and citizens.  The basis of the country’s defence is the Bulgarian Army.  The main activities in the defence area include: 
 - accomplishment of the defence missions as defined in the National Security Concept, Military Doctrine and Military Strategy of the Republic of Bulgaria; 
 - cooperation with other countries and international organizations for the purposes of country’s defence and integration in the European and Euro-Atlantic security structures;

The preparation of the country for defence includes: preparation of the national economy; preparation of the Armed Forces, preparation of the territory of the country as theatre, and preparation of the population for defence.  The preparation of the national economy for work in wartime includes: 
 - development and implementation of military technological state policy; 
 - preparation and updating of a General State Wartime Plan; 
 - coordination and management of the planning for transition of the national economy sectors to work in wartime.  For the purposes of a well-functioning national economy in wartime the Council of Ministers, after considering the proposal of the Minister of Defence, approves a General State Wartime Plan and assigns the respective authorities its implementation. For the purposes of implementation of the wartime plan the adequate production capabilities are determined, built and maintained as well as the necessary state reserves and national wartime reserves. At peace time the wartime capabilities can be used fully, partially or not at all. The state budget funds the activities on preparation and maintenance of the national economy for work in war time.  The full or partial implementation of the wartime plans is decided by the President of the Republic after a proposal of the Council of Ministers.  The Council of Ministers determines the exact procedures of wartime adaptation of the national economy.  The preparation of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria for defence is a complex compound of activities, carried out under the direction of the Ministry of Defence, the General Staff and the Main HQs of the services. The aim is: building and development of the Armed Forces; operational, combat and


-----

# mobilization training of the troops; planning of their strategic deployment and employment during a military conflict; forming and maintenance of high moral and psychological steadiness of the personnel; establishment and maintenance of a command and control system for the Armed Forces; improvement of the logistic support system and training of commanders.  The preparation of the territory of the country as theatre of war includes: establishment and development of the key transport communications; development of the state communications system; development of the electricity supply system; establishment of a network of state bases and material assets warehouses; establishment of a network of maintenance factories; establishment of a network of medical institutions; development of the meteorological and navigation support system; topogeodetic and topographic preparation of the territory of the country; development of the state water supply system; preparation for drawing out the main dams in the country to a minimum functioning capacity; creation of the necessary living and working conditions for the Armed Forces, etc.  The operational preparation of the territory of the country is a complex of coordinated and interrelated activities, comprising the construction, equipment and maintenance in combat ready status of various infrastructure sites that will be used in the interest of country’s defence and the civil protection of the population. To the interest of defence the national infrastructure is built so as to be capable to interact with NATO forces.  The preparation of the population for defence includes: keeping up the national spirit; training of the central and local administration personnel; accumulation and training of a mobilization contingent; training in the areas of civil protection and territorial defence; medical treatment of the wounded and sick people and care for the war invalids and sufferers. 

 3.2. Support of Peace and Security The support to peace and security is a continuation and result of the state foreign and military policy and is an important factor for military political crisis prevention which is achieved through: 
 - building and maintenance of ready military potential, forces and assets for early warning correspondent to the external risks and threats as an argument and power in support of the policy for peace and security of the country; 
 - military cooperation as an important instrument of state policy in the relationships with other countries in the military and security areas; 
 - participation in the international community efforts for prevention, solution and liquidation of the consequences from conflicts and crises. 

 3.3. Management of Political-Military Crises Political-military crisis management is a system of diplomatic, political, military, economic, humanitarian and other activities aiming at the identification


-----

# of the signs of the crisis and taking the necessary decisions for action and their execution and control. The Armed Forces participate in the overall process of crisis management taking into account their character, acting in confirm of terms and conditions set by international treaties, taking into account the potential reaction of the International Organizations (defined also through prognosis based on early warning systems), use of preventive diplomacy, peacemaking, peacekeeping and peace support, and post-crisis economic and political integration. The decisions for direct participation of the Armed Forces in military political crisis management are taken by the authorized by the Constitution and by the law bodies.  The crisis management of a single crisis starts from the moment when the characteristics of the crisis has been clarified and separately distinguished. It continues through the phases of development, escalation and de-escalation and ends with the establishment of a new stable status. During every step or stage of development of a crisis, the staff managing the crisis gathers information on purpose, makes analysis of the situation, identifies the politico-military objectives, develops strategy which guarantees defence of the national interests and security. Within the frames of that strategy - makes planning with courses of action and assures the implementation of some of them namely those which bring under control the destabilizing factors, stop their development, prevent from their de-escalation, lessen the intensity of their confrontation, reduce threats aiming at vital interests of participants, assure the conduct of negotiations in order mutually agreed decisions on problems to be achieved, stop the confrontation activities, in particular war conflict.  The crisis management must provide prevention of arise of crisis situations as well as mechanisms and instruments for bringing to minimum the harmful consequences from a crisis that had already passed, to allow use of liberty when choosing activities related to the solving of a crisis, and reconstructing the normal conditions in the fastest possible way.  The process of crisis management is closely related to: international activities in the context of the global process of integration; inner processes of civil military cooperation, support to the population and civil protection; planning of crisis prevention at national, ministerial and territorial level; need for taking into consideration of great amount of crisis factors through multiple, iterative informing and coordination among the institutions engaged with anti-crisis activities responsible for decision making and taking of adequate actions under severe shortage of time.  At present this is possible using a national early warning system in relation to the crisis factors which set the components of a politico-military crisis related to: economical, financial and social instability; instability due to different forms of international isolation; instability related to preservation of security and public order (organized crime, terrorism, ethnic and religious tensions); instability due to potential refugee flows, military threats (deliberate violation of borders, large

# scale sabotage and other activities aiming at collapsing the combat capabilities of the Armed Forces and destruction of means for defence, use of organized by another country armed formations and direct military aggression; mass epidemics and damages, as a result of bacteriological, biological and chemical contamination; instability coming as a result of limitation of incoming resources, needed in different spheres of social and economic life; instability of the information resources, assuring the decision making process in important political, military and economical spheres of state management. 

 3.4. Civil Protection The civil protection of the population is a system of social, economic, and technological humanitarian activities implemented with the purpose of peacetime and wartime protection of the population and national economy, avoidance and reduction of losses and negative consequences, rescue and emergency activities, ensuring the necessary conditions for survival and assistance in times of disasters, damages, catastrophes and armed conflicts.  The peacetime and wartime activities for protection of the population and national economy are a joint function of the state authorities, local government and administration authorities, the organizations and the citizens.  For the purposes of Search and Rescue (SAR) operations and emergency restorations in the country during crises situations, management bodies and paramilitary and civil formations are established.  The protection of the population is realized through: 
 - forces and assets, established for direct implementation of the protection tasks; 
 - forces and assets of ministries and departments, economic and scientific organizations, executing their basic functions, part of which have sometimes defence implications.  For the civil protection of the population in case of disasters, damages and catastrophes the following forces are foreseen coming from: the Civil Protection organization, military formations belonging to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Defence, forces and assets of the Ministry of Health, from other ministries and organizations, bodies of the central and local administration and community self-governing, non-governmental organizations and volunteers.  In order to ensure the protection of the troops /forces/ in times of disasters and damages, plans for protection of the troops /forces/ are developed and maintained, and as far as the protection of the population is concerned – there are plans for interaction with the state administration authorities and between the different departments, participating in the National Plan for Protection of the Population.  The ministry of Foreign Affairs through the diplomatic missions of the Republic of Bulgaria carries out activities for protection of Bulgarian citizens, being abroad due to different causes in countries where a military conflict exists

# 4.2. Organizational Structure of the Armed Forces The personnel of the Armed Forces includes the servicemen from the Bulgarian Army, the Ministry of Defence and the structures subordinated to the Minister of Defence.  The structures subordinated to the Minister of Defence are: the Military Information Service; the Security - Military Police and Military Counterintelligence Service; G.S.Rakovski War College; the Military Medical Academy, and the executive agencies to the Minister of Defence.  A reform of the Armed Forces is going on in the Republic of Bulgaria. The goal is to optimize their organization and structures in accordance with the changes of the military strategic environment, financial, economic, demographic capabilities of the country, and the requirement for accelerated achievement of a high level of interoperability with the NATO forces, and in the near future - NATO membership.  In terms of organization the Bulgarian Armyconsists of General Staff, Land Forces, Air Force, Navy, formations and units that are under a central subordination.  The General Staff is a main body for strategic command and control of the Bulgarian Army in peacetime and of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria in wartime. In wartime it directs the Armed Forces’ transition from peacetime to wartime status, the establishment of the defensive groupings, the preparation and conduct of the operations and the territorial defence.  The General Staff assists the Chief of General Staff to execute the leadership of the Bulgarian Army and the coordination of the activities between the services of the Armed Forces.  The General Staff activities and functions are designed to provide the strategic command and control of the Bulgarian Army and to ensure the accomplishment of the tasks as determined by the national security and defence guiding documents.  The structure of the General Staff and of the other HQs of the Bulgarian Army is consistent with the accepted in the NATO nations standard staff structure.  National Military Command Centre is deployed in subordination to the Chief of General Staff; it is a standing operational body of the Minister of Defence and Chief of General Staff of the Bulgarian Army.  The services of the Armed Forces are the main part of the country’s Armed Forces; they have a specific function, organization, weapons and combat equipment, modes of conducting military activities and systems for manning and training of their personnel.  The services of the Armed Forces include branches of forces and special troops.  The branches of forces possess typical for them weapons and combat equipment enabling the accomplishment of their tasks. 


-----

# The special troops /forces/ are designated to support the activities of the services and branches of forces.  In terms of organization the Armed Forces are subdivided into formations, units and sub-units. The formations can be strategic and operational.  The strategic formation is a formation established for conducting joint operations at the strategic level for achieving strategic national (multinational) goals. It consists of two or more operational formations from minimum two services of the Armed Forces.  The operational formation consists of formations and units from one service of the Armed Forces (Land Forces, Air Force, and Navy).  The main formation of combined arms and services in the commands of the Land Forces is the mechanized (light infantry) brigade and the armored brigade. The commands include units of the branches of forces and of the special troops and logistic support units.  The disposition of the Armed Forces characterizes the way in which the formations, units, subunits, command and control bodies, and institutions are located in peacetime as well as when are outside the hostilities zone in wartime. It depends on the traditions of the country, the concepts for the employment of troops and forces, and the capabilities of the infrastructure. Plan 2004 is in conformity with the capabilities of the points for permanent disposition (stationing) for peacetime functioning and timely transformation of the formations to the wartime establishments and the status of the infrastructure.  The size of the Armed Forces is determined depending on the source and degree of the military threat, the type of the possible military conflict, the demographic and economic capabilities of the country, the organizational structure of the Armed Forces, the capabilities of the possible enemies, the physical and geographical conditions and the restrictions imposed by the international treaties.  In peacetime the Land Forces maintain permanent combat and mobilization readiness and train for conduct of high-maneuver and sustainable defence and for participation in operations other than war. In case of military conflict they counteract the enemy’s attacks and withstand the operational areas of the theatre. Through active actions, in interaction with the Air Force, and in the coastal axis also with the Navy, the Land Forces defeat the penetrated enemy’s groupings and restore the country’s territorial integrity.  In peacetime the Land Forces include Land Forces HQ, units subordinate to the Land Forces HQ, Operational Forces Command, two Commands (East and West) and Special Operations Forces Command.  The Land Forces HQ are the main body for operational command and control of the Land Forces and assists the Chief of the Land Forces HQ in his command and control of the Land Forces and in the coordination of the activities of the branches of and special forces. 


-----

# The Land Forces include branches of and special forces. The branches of forces are: mechanized; armored forces; artillery; air defence forces; and special operations forces.  The special forces include combat support formations and logistic and medical support forces.  The combat support formations are: intelligence; signal; engineer; and nuclear, biological and chemical defence and ecology.  The logistic and medical support forces include formations, units, subunits and institutions for logistic and medical support.  The organization, structure, tasks and operational /combat/ employment of the Land Forces are developed in the Land Forces Doctrine.  In peacetime the Air Force assures the control of the flight rules regime and the inviolability of the airspace of the Republic of Bulgaria, conduct operational and combat training and training for participation in operations other than war. In wartime, independently or jointly with the other services of the Armed Forces, accomplish tasks on establishing and maintaining air superiority; air defence of troops and sites on the ground; interdiction missions; close air support to the Land Forces and the Navy; reconnaissance and special operations.  In peacetime the Air Force includes Air Force HQ, Air Defence Command, Tactical Aviation Command and units subordinated to them.  The Air Force includes branches of forces and special forces.  The branches of forces are: aviation (fighter, attack, reconnaissance and transport aviation); anti-aircraft missile forces; radio-technical forces; signal forces; and logistic and medical support forces.  The special forces include units /forces/ for combat support, special technical support and logistic and medical support.  The organization, structure, tasks and combat employment of the branches of forces and special forces of the Air Force are developed in the Air Force Doctrine.  In peacetime the Navy maintains a favorable operational regime, observation and control of the shipping in the sea areas of the Republic of Bulgaria, conduct operational and combat training and training for participation in operations other than war. In wartime, independently or jointly with the other services of the Armed Forces counteract the enemy’s aggression at sea, provide the naval communications and give assistance to the coastal flank of the Land Forces.  In peacetime the Navy includes Navy HQ, units subordinate to the Navy HQ and two Naval Bases.  The Navy includes the following branches of forces: strike forces; antisubmarine forces; mine warfare forces, and auxiliary ships.  The organization, structure, tasks and combat employment of the branches of forces of the Navy are developed in the Navy Doctrine.

# 4.3. Functional Structure of the Bulgarian Army The troops and forces of the Bulgarian Army are functionally subdivided into Active and Reserve Forces.  The Active Forces include Deployable Forces and Main Defence Forces.  The Reserve Forces include Augmentation Forces and Territorial Defence Forces.  The Active and the Reserve Forces of the Bulgarian Army provide a major contribution to the national defence, considerable contribution to NATO’s collective defence and a reasonable contribution to Peace Support Operations.  The Rapid Reaction Forces are annually determined by Order of the Minister of Defence and are maintained in readiness for accomplishment of tasks on the collective and national defence.  The forces for defence of the national territory are formations and units from the services and directly subordinate to the General Staff.  In combat operations for defence of the national territory all forces of the Bulgarian Army are involved.  The Augmentation Forces include mechanized brigades of the Land Forces and formations from the services, the branches and the special forces, which are deployed in peacetime and serve for augmentation of the defence forces.  The Territorial Defence Forces are formed in wartime on a territorial principle. Peacetime establishment from the Bulgarian Army is not provided for them.  The Reserve Forces are part of the forces of the Bulgarian Army which have a low percentage of manning, smaller expenses for their training. They are not maintained in operational readiness and do not form a combat potential in peacetime. Their tasks include planning and training of reservists, storage of armament and equipment, training of formations for the rotation needs of the Active Forces or for increase of their size, etc. If required, they form the Augmentation Forces and the Territorial Defence Forces.  In case of a large-scale war conflict danger, by decision of the Supreme Command, Strategic Reserves of the country’s Armed Forces can be formed. In peacetime, no personnel are earmarked for them and they are not included in the Bulgarian Army’s wartime establishment.  The manpower reserve for the Bulgarian Army’s needs is a standing and a mobilization reserve, which is formed, maintained and used for filling in the peacetime and wartime formations, as well as for creation of new ones before or in the course of the war. In that way, conditions for maintaining a higher mobilization readiness of the Bulgarian Army under the new military-political and economic realities are created.  The Standing Reserve is part of the Mobilization Reserve at a high readiness level and it serves for further manning of peacetime structures of the Bulgarian Army. The size of the Standing Reserve is annually determined by Order of the Minister of Defence depending on the resources planned for its maintenance. 


-----

# The Mobilization Reserve consists of reservists with adequate military training and serves for manning of the Bulgarian Army formations up to their wartime establishments.  With a view to achieving compatibility with the NATO concepts on the carrying out of collective and national defence, the Bulgarian Army forces are functionally subdivided into: 
 - Deployable Forces, designated for the NATO collective defence needs; 
 - In-Place Forces, designated for national territory defence and other  national tasks.  The Deployable Forces include Land Forces, Air Force and Navy components. Part of the Deployable Forces are earmarked for rapid reaction. They are manned and equipped at 100% and are maintained in permanent readiness status.  In peacetime, the Deployable Forces participate in search and rescue operations, humanitarian operations, peace support operations outside the territory of the country and struggle against armed terrorist groups.  For participation in the European defence forces, a contingent of CIMIC units and officers is prepared.  For participation in peace support operations, the forces and assets declared within the framework of PfP Planning and Review Process (PARP) are maintained.  For participation in the Multinational Peace Force Southeastern Europe (MPFSEE), the forces and assets declared under the MPFSEE Agreement are maintained, and for the multinational operational naval formation ‘BLACKSEAFOR’ at the Black Sea ships from the ones envisaged to participate in peace support operations are designated depending on the mission assigned. 

 4.4. Mobilization System The transition of the Armed Forces from peacetime to wartime state is an important aspect of the strategic deployment. It consists in mobilization, organizational and combat structuring of the command and control bodies, formations and units as well as their training for executing combat tasks in compliance with their designation.  The mobilization is a series of activities aimed at Armed Forces transition from peacetime to wartime establishment. It can be general and partial, and comprises of the following activities: notification of the formations, units, military commands, communities, municipalities and reservists; deployment of unit in-processing stations for both personnel and equipment; supply of the reservists and national economy equipment from the in-processing stations to the units and formations; reception of the reservists and national economy equipment and distribution to the units; equipping the reservists with the respective property and personal weapon; national economy equipment

# maintenance and re-supply; de-preservation of the armaments and military equipment; loading the stock of material means; and organizing the mobilization combat support. 

 4.5. Training of the Armed Forces The training system of the Bulgarian Armed Forces includes training of the officers, staffs, troops and force. It is conducted on the basis of staff action plans at all levels which annually define the content, sequence, time and topics of events to be conducted in accordance with the allocated financial and material resources.  The training process of commanders, staffs and forces is based on: 
 - Plan for the Training of the Bulgarian Army during the academic year; 
 - Annual Plans for the Training of the Armed Forces Services (the commands, formations, units).  The main forms of the commanders and staffs training are as follows: operational meetings; command drills; staff training; operational command post exercises (CPX), which are regulated by the doctrines, combat manuals, directives and courses for troops (force) combat training. A basic form of the theoretical and language training of the officers are the theoretical classes as well as specialized courses held in the country and abroad.  The contents of the staff training is enlarged through the participation in operations other than war within the multinational forces contingent formed on bilateral or multilateral basis.  With the aim of achieving NATO interoperability and adapting NATO staff standardization documentation and procedures to our conditions, the relative share of the computer-assisted exercises (CAX) is increased, thus achieving a high degree of staff preparedness at considerably lower rate of resource spending.  In the units of the Bulgarian Army the training of the units and formations is conducted under the guidance of the immediate commanders (chiefs), and consists of implementation of combat employment preparatory events.  Exercises are conducted in close to real-life environment, on complex topics and with the participation of units and formations from the other services, branches and special operations forces.  The mobilization training of the commanders, staffs, troops, reserve component, military commands, government and business leadership consists in a conduct of and participation in mobilization drills, mobilization games, mobilization exercises and mobilization meetings.  The modern forms of training based on information technologies are developed in the Concept for Using Simulation Systems for the Staffs, Troops and Forces Training.  The troops (forces) training is guided by the Doctrine for training of the troops and forces, regulations, courses, manuals and programmes.

# 4.6. Interoperability There are two main ways interoperability to be achieved – interoperability between the troops and forces in the Bulgarian Army and interoperability between the Bulgarian Army and the NATO troops.  The interoperability between the troops and forces consists of achievement of high level of unification of the combat capabilities of the different services and branches and the special troops inside their structure for joint functioning and fulfillment of combat tasks.  The Bulgarian Army is subdivided into services, which is defined by the necessity each service to be able to carry out strategic and operational missions to some extent independently; by the necessity to make the best use of the combat capabilities of the different assets for conduct of the war; by the creation of conditions for effective command and control of the troops, effective and timely logistic support. The organizational-structural development of the Armed Forces allows complete realization of the combat characteristics and the main role of the different types of armaments and equipment in compliance with the type of the tasks carried out and the methods of their combat use. In order to make use of the different types of weapons more effectively every service is subdivided into branches and special troops.  The main document regulating the achievement of this type of interoperability and the joint action of the services is the Doctrine for Joint Operations.  The interoperability with the NATO troops means achievement of high level of capabilities for carrying out of joint operations of units from the Bulgarian Army with NATO troops. This goal is been achieved by implementation of the NATO standards in the three main areas of standardization - administrative, technical and operational. The realization in practice of this entire process is been carried out by the participation of the Bulgarian Army in the PfP initiative, in the Defence Planning and Review Process (PARP), and the implementation of the Membership Action Plan (MAP). 

 4.7. Procedures for Armed Forces Employment The Armed Forces are employed in compliance with the procedures, as defined by the Constitution, the Military Doctrine, the Military Strategy and the national Legislation, for: 
 - fulfilment of the inherent right of individual and collective defence as stated in Article 51 of the UN Charter; 
 - fulfilment of international commitments in conducting operations other than war; 
 - consequences liquidation of natural disasters, industrial damages and dangerous pollutions on the national territory or abroad; 
 - fulfilment of international agreements and arrangements made by the competent bodies for cooperation with NATO.

# In order to carry out the missions related to the inherent right of individual and collective defence the Armed Forces: 
 - participate in the crises management when the sovereignty of the country is underthreat through:maintaining the necessary combat potential and its demonstration in support of the state policy when necessary; collecting, summarizing and analyzing the information, and predicting the changes in the military-strategic environment, and proposing suggestions for Bulgaria’s involvement, and the Armed Forces participation in particular, in the crisis management; gradually increasing the readiness of the system for early warning and management and with a following activating the crisis planning system; adequate increasing the readiness of systems and forces for immediate action (reaction) and restraining after the “announced enemy party” has started demonstration of adverse actions; conducting events and actions for conflict prevention in its early stages of development; ensuring the security and protection of the state borders when the border police is not capable of doing so; repelling armed actions and invasion of major military and paramilitary formations; increasing the readiness of the Armed Forces adequately to the threat of conflict spreading onto the territory of the country; 
 - provide direct defence of the countrythrough:conducting operations, in order to reflect the aggression, depending on the character and intensity of the conflict, which include defensive and offensive operations aimed at stopping the aggressor’s invasion to the inland to occupy parts of the country. In the worst case of aggression, when the adversary is superior, the Armed Forces conduct a strategic defensive operation where total mobilization of the armed forces and the country is done, and gradually or simultaneously the Deployable Forces, the Defence and Reserve troops are deployed to the theater of operations and the defence and territorial defence units are formed. They maintain surveillance and patrol flights for defending and protecting air space integrity; provide direct defence of the countrythrough:maintaining surveillance of the situation of the maritime territories of the Republic of Bulgaria and conduct operations for their defence.  At all times, opportunities will be considered to stop operations and proceed to political negotiations, as well as opportunities to accept foreign military support or a peace support operation.  In order to fulfill international commitments in operations other than war,the Armed Forces: participate in different forms of military cooperation; by a resolution endorsed by the Parliament, participate in peace support operations led by UN, NATO, OSCE and other international organizations with the forces and assets declared under the PfP; as scheduled by the competent bodies, they will, independently and in cooperation with the international organizations and separate countries, participate in the evacuation of Bulgarian citizens from countries wheretheir lives have been at risk; they will trainpersonnel and maintain equipment, and, by virtue of Parliamentary resolution, they will

 4.8. Intelligence and Information Support to the Interest of Defence The Minister of Defense directs the information support activities in the interest of the defence and national security. The Chief of the General Staff of the Bulgarian Army directs the Bulgarian Army Intelligence.  The Intelligence and the Information Support comprise a combination of activities done by the government, military leadership, commanders and HQs at all levels, as well as focused actions of the troops and forces conducted to timely collect data on the military and political situation, armed forces and military and economic potential of a prospective or active adversary.  The goal and the functions of the intelligence and the information support in peacetime as well as in crises and conflicts of different intensity, is to provide timely complete and exact data, assessments, analyses and projects to all state and military structures charged with formulating policies, planning and decision making in the interest of the defence and national security. 


-----

# The Intelligence is organized into an integrated system at military-political, strategic, operational and tactical levels. It coordinates the actions of the bodies of the different intelligence structures, and manages the process of collecting, processing, analyzing and disseminating intelligence data. This system maintains a global database and is capable of focusing its efforts on a certain crisis or conflict. A decisive role has the capability of the system to screen and disseminate information to various levels depending on the users’ requirements.  The priority development and modernization of the intelligence system is determined by the global tendencies, challenges and risks, which are assessed as existing, appearing and developing in the first decades of XXI century, as well as by the higher level of requirements for the technical capabilities of the information support assets.  The National Intelligence Service and the Service “Military Information” in the Ministry of Defense perform the tasks at military-political and military- strategic level.  The tasks at strategic, operational and tactical level are performed by the Bulgarian Army. The requirements, principles and tasks for organizing and managing the Reconnaissance are defined in the Doctrine for the Intelligence of the Bulgarian Army. 

 4.9. Logistic Support The logistic support is an integral part of the military logistics, ruling the planning and execution of the movement, and the support of the Armed Forces. The military logistics solves all the questions related to making projects, development, acquisition, storage, movement, metrological control, distribution, support, evacuation and release of material assets; movement, evacuation and hospitalization of the personnel; acquisition or establishment, maintenance, usage and release of immovable material assets and facilities; purchase and provision of services. The military logistics comprises of production logistics and customer logistics. The customer military logistics lays as a base of the organization of the logistic support of the Bulgarian Army.  The Logistic Support is a major type of support of the Armed Forces.  The responsibilities for the logistic support are divided between the bodies of the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and the command structure of the Bulgarian Army depending on the opportunities for integration of the efforts. The commanders are responsible for the logistic support of the forces and assets directly subordinated to them.  The supplies for the Bulgarian Army during peacetime is organized according to the territorial principle. For this purpose the territory of the country is divided into supply zones with respectfully established supply centers, subordinated to the Logistics and Medical Support Command. All troops formations, no matter to which service they do belong, are attached to them. The supply centers

# provide logistical support to the considered military units for supply according to the principle of the joint transport, medical and public services.  In order interoperability among the supply elements in the Bulgarian Army to be achieved and fulfilment of supply of material assets, in the country a five- stages system for identification of the supply classes in the Bulgarian Army has been approved, which is compatible with the NATO system.  The transport support includes the whole spectrum of infrastructure, bodies, facilities and equipment, which are needed for deployment, receiving, movement and relocation of the Armed Forces during carrying out an operation. The use of separate type of transport - air transport, land (trains, wheels vehicles and tube) as well as sea lift depends on the geographical peculiarities and the existing infrastructure.  The rebuilt and reconstruction of armaments and equipment are a significant factor for the successful execution of all kinds of operations both in peacetime and during crises or war.  The medical support has as a task to protect and preserve the health of the servicemen by applying measures for preserving their good physical and psychological status, illnesses and wounds prophylactics and curing of already emerged diseases. The medical support is divided (distributed in echelons) among medical posts and medical departments.  Integral parts of the medical support are the administrative and field services, related to the personnel, the CIVMIL cooperation and financing.  The strategic goal of the Logistic Support of the Bulgarian Army during the next four years is to develop a system for Logistic Support, adequate as much as possible to the economic capabilities of the country, to the changing structure of the Armed Forces and to face the requirements of achieving interoperability with the corresponding structures in the Armies of the NATO member states.  Priority tasks are: implementation of the Partnership Goals (PGs); achievement of structural and functional interoperability for logistic support with the ones from the Armies of the NATO member states as well as reliable support of contingents, participating in multinational operations.  In compliance with the economic stability of the National Economy and the positive influence of the market mechanisms a transition to public services support provided by different firms has been made, as well as to security of the military regions, maintenance of the armament, equipment and properties in the maintenance bases and stores, service subscription and transport services for the deliveries.  Modernization of the existing armament and equipment and the rearmament of the Bulgarian Army according to the NATO standards will be carried out in compliance with the provided financial resources of the Armed Forces.  The Logistic Support of the Bulgarian Army is defined in the Concept for the Joint Logistic Support, the Doctrine for the Logistic Support of the Bulgarian Army, the Concept for building, development and use of the Logistic Support

 4.10. Armed Forces Management System The management, command and communications and information support system is developed to provide a stable and effective management of the Bulgarian Army in peacetime, and of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria and the country in wartime, in conducting the daily activities, their transition to higher levels and status of combat readiness and in crises and various intensity level conflicts.  The system consists of: management bodies, command posts, communications and information system and for the Air Force and the Navy - a surveillance system.  The management of the Bulgarian Army in peacetime and of the Armed Forces in wartime is implemented at three levels.  In peacetime: 
 - Strategic level - General Staff of the Bulgarian Army; 
 - Operational level - HQs of the Services; 
 - Tactical level - the Departments and Command Staffs of the Land Forces and Air Force, the Naval bases of the Navy, the Departments and Staffs of the units and formations.  In wartime: 
 - Strategic level - Supreme Command; 
 - Operational level - Commands and Staffs of the Field Army, the Air Force and the Navy; 
 - Tactical level - the Departments and Command Staffs of the Land Forces and Air Force, the Naval bases of the Navy, the Departments and Staffs of the units and formations.  For management of the territorial defence in wartime a command is formed, which is an integral part of the Supreme Command.  The information flow among the command posts is ensured through building up joint communications and information system, maintained constantly ready for management of the Bulgarian Army in peacetime and after a following manning and augmentation the system provides the necessary capabilities for the Armed Forces and the country to accomplish their duties in wartime.  To fulfil their tasks on management of the troops and forces the command bodies deploy and occupy Command Posts. According to their designation the Command Posts are Main, Reserve, Rear, Auxiliary and Temporary.  The management system at operational and tactical level is developed in the Doctrines of the Services and the combat regulations.

# 4.11. Manning of the Army The general rules in the development of the military practice from regional, European and world point of view define the gradual transition from mixed conscript-professional towards totally professional Army.  The Active Forces have to be fully prepared, manned and equipped. The forces, declared as in-readiness for the PfP initiative to take part in NATO-led Peace Support Operations and the forces, assigned to multinational peace forces have to be entirely professionalized.  The building-up of totally professional combat ready formations with professional soldiers is a priority. This improves the quality of the training, the effective use of the armament and combat equipment capacities and enhances the readiness and motivation of the personnel. Appropriate conditions have been created for achieving the planned partnership goals for interoperability with the NATO forces and for implementing a successful gradual approach towards the professionalization of the Army.  The success of the Bulgarian Army professionalization is directly connected with the development of the permanent reserve system.  All possibilities for manning the Bulgarian Army with qualified personnel have been used during the process of professionalization. The selection system is being improved in order to facilitate the military profession attractiveness and the social integration and development of the professional military personnel as a whole. Broad public support is necessary achieved through social debate development on the professional army issues and improved information environment, created by the means of purposeful media policy and permanent advertising campaign directed on the manning the Army with professional personnel.  The personnel education and training is accomplished at the military academies and is expanded with education in foreign military academies and colleges, and in civilian universities in the country and abroad as well.  The purpose is to create adequate conditions for personnel education in accordance with the Bulgarian Army needs and the modern educational standards.  “Vassil Levski” Land Forces Academy, “Panayot Volov” Artillery and Air Defence Academy and “Georgi Benkovski” Air Force Academy are being reorganized into a National Military University. “Nikola Yonkov Vaptzarov” Navy Academy remains as an independent military academy.  The National Military University consists of three faculties - Land Forces, Air Force and Artillery and AD forces faculties. All the faculties have post - graduate training centers.  Training bases for officers, NCOs, professional soldiers and conscripts, reservists and cadets are being established on the territory of the up to now existing military academies.

# “Georgi Stoikov Rakovski” War College is a national institution of higher education for military and military-political sciences and military history.  The supervision of the personnel educational and training system is done by the Minister of Defence, and the direct management is done by the Chief of General Staff of the Bulgarian Army. 

 5. Basic Forms of Employment of the Armed Forces

 5.1. Operations in Non-military Crises Operations during crises of non-military character are organized streamlined activities of formations of the Bulgarian Army aimed at preventing, gaining control of and liquidation of crises of humanitarian character in and out of the territory of the country. They are performed under the terms of the Crisis Management Law, the Defence and Armed Forces Law, and the Military Doctrine of the Republic of Bulgaria. These operations are aimed at providing timely and effective humanitarian assistance to the population, management of crises and overcoming negative consequences over the infrastructure and natural environment.  During peacetime the participation of Armed Forces in operations in crises with non-military character on the territory of the country encompasses carrying out of activities related to preventive and immediate defence of the population and the national economy in case of natural disasters, damages and catastrophes, and in case of declaring emergency situation they can take part in counter WMD proliferation operations as well as in operations against illegal traffic of weapons, international terrorism, and operations for safeguarding strategic objects and anti-terrorist activities.  Operations during multinational humanitarian crises are activities, carried out on the territory of another state as a result of a demand for international assistance during natural disasters, major industrial damages and dangerous pollutions of the natural environment, when there is a danger for the life and health of the people, the functioning of the economy, infrastructure and natural environment. Such operations include actions (activities) related to providing assistance to the population, which is endangered or suffered from crisis, overcoming the consequences and provision of humanitarian aid.  The participation of the Bulgarian Army formations in such types of operations is declared by the Doctrine for operations other than war. 

 5.2. Peace Support Operations The Peace Support Operations are multifunctional operations, including different initiatives and activities aimed at achieving long-term solving of inner or international conflicts which may put in danger the international peace and stability as well as other humanitarian problems. The formations from the


-----

# Bulgarian Army can participate in: peacekeeping operations, conflict prevention operations, peacemaking operations, peace enforcement operations, peacebuilding operations and humanitarian operations.  The formations from the Bulgarian Army which take part in peace support operations outside the territory of the country, can conduct land, air, navy or special operations under the terms of peace support operations.  The Bulgarian Army participates in operations (activities) outside the territory of the country with the prepared in advance for such tasks units and formations. Their strength of the participating forces is defined in the Decision of the National Assembly, and the tasks - under the conditions for conducting the mission, and under the terms of the treaties and agreements part of which is the Republic of Bulgaria. The formations participating in missions (activities) outside the territory of the country cannot carry out other than the agreed before missions. 

 5.3. Operations in cases of low and medium intensity military conflicts For solving low and medium intensity war conflicts the Armed Forces conduct offensive and defensive operations in the whole spectrum of their diversity. The strength, the means and the type of the operations will depend on the character of the activities performed by the invading (acting) on the territory of the country adversary, the strength of the adversary formations and the character of the military-political environment.  For dealing with medium intensity conflicts the Armed Forces will carry out operation aiming at stopping the adversary’s aggression. The type, form and contents of such an operation will be defined by the strength of the adversary and the strength of the friendly forces, the way the conflict has begun and the methods used by the adversary for conducting its operations, the readiness of the friendly forces in the endangered area, etc.  In order to stop the adversary’s aggression all or part of the active forces from all the services are engaged, combat ready formations or part of the units/formations located in the endangered areas as well as formations from other ministries are engaged according to the adopted legislative documents. 

 5.4. Strategic Defensive Operation In cases of war conflicts the Armed Forces conduct combat operations. They are a compound of combat activities carried out by armed formations, by the use of which tactical, operational and strategic goals are achieved.  The main form for employment of the Armed Forces in case of high-intensity war conflict is the Strategic Defensive Operation (SDO).  The SDO is a compound of conducting different types of operations, carried out according to the plan of the Supreme Command for achieving strategic goals.

 6. Integration and Military Cooperation The Republic of Bulgaria steadily and persistently follows its way towards NATO. The activities undertaken for the preparation of the national political, economic and defence systems in order to meet the membership requirements are radical, consistent, purposeful and specific. The active participation in the

# international military and military-political co-operation is substantial contribution to guaranteeing the national security.  The integration and military cooperation generate trust and stability. Southeastern Europe is becoming an attractive place for investments, which gradually increases the possibilities for economical development and prosperity. This is important for reducing the influence of the risk factors and directly and indirectly reflects upon the security of the Armed Forces and the country.  The role of the Bulgarian Armed Forces is to generate initiatives continuing the foreign and military policy, which are to be implemented in the frameworks of bilateral and multilateral partnership programs in the military sphere. The Bulgarian Army will continue to be an active partner of the armed forces of the countries participating in the PfP Initiative. Currently Bulgaria trains and prepares forces and assets for peace support operations and PfP exercises, including Land Forces, Air Force and Navy. The country is ready to make infrastructure facilities available for joint military activities, in case they have to be conducted on the territory of the country.  The military-political frameworks of NATO peace support operations, the Defence Capabilities Initiative, the Multinational Joint Task Force Concept and the NATO Operational Capabilities Concept altogether create the military- political base for including forces and assets from the partner-states in NATO - led PfP operations on the stage of the increased and more operational Partnership for Peace.  The specified tasks for the Bulgarian Army, derived from the MAP are:  reorganization and restructuring of the Bulgarian Army and the central administration of the Ministry of Defence; organization and training of forces designated for the collective defence needs and for Washington treaty non- Article 5 operations; modernization of the Bulgarian Army; interoperable military structure development; standardization improvement; development and cooperation in the spheres of the military geography and the military-research activities; development of the national logistic support system applying NATO standards and the ecological protection of the Bulgarian Army.  The military co-operation plays two-directional role in the process of upgrading and development of the Bulgarian Army. The upgraded operational capabilities rise the role of the Bulgarian Army as a reliable partner in the different forms of co-operation. On the other hand the bilateral co-operation programs offer a variety of possibilities for gaining valuable experience, NATO standards and procedures practice, testing and assessment of the results achieved in the interoperability sphere. The priorities in the process of co-operation are defined in accordance with the interoperability needs and taking into account the importance of the military contacts for the confidence and security building. The planning is based on clearly defined goals and priorities policy, established after analyzing and evaluating the results achieved. For this purpose all possibilities

# included in the framework of the expanded and adapted PfP Planning and Review Process /PARP/ and other forms of co-operation are used.  The Republic of Bulgaria completely supports the peace and stability strengthening initiatives in the region of South-Eastern Europe. An eloquent expression of this policy is the contribution to the establishment and functioning the Multinational Peace Forces for South-Eastern Europe /MPFSEE/ and the Naval Co-operation Operational Group (BLACKSEEFOR).  The training of the personnel of the units is conducted obligatory in compliance with the NATO Armed Forces training criteria. In accordance with the operational readiness requirements they are periodically inspected and certified.  The participation of the SEEBRIG Bulgarian contingent in peace support operations is in accordance with the Constitution and laws of the Republic of Bulgaria.  The upgrading of the Armed Forces interoperability is a key element for the Republic of Bulgaria integration in NATO. The implementation of the Membership Action Plan trough the Annual National Program determines the achievement of the basic operational, technical and administrative NATO standards. The main directions in enhancing the interoperability of the Armed Forces are as follows: 
 - restructuring and reorganization of the Bulgarian Army in accordance with the Organizational Development Plan 2004 and the Membership Action Plan; 
 - Partnership Goals Implementation, allowing the attainment of an adequate level of interoperability by the forces and assets, designated for participating in peace support operations, and of the Armed Forces as a whole as well. Most of these goals will be implemented in the period 2001-2004; 
 - development and implementation of specific practical programs for upgrading of the Armed Forces in basic areas such as language training perfection, air defence and air traffic control, consultation procedures system, command, control and CIS (C-4I), military infrastructure and logistic support, training of forces earmarked for PSO; 
 - strict gradual implementation of the accepted MAP obligations for the purposes of attaining interoperability with the NATO forces in support of the membership preparation and for enhancing the combat capabilities of the Armed Forces; 
 - intensified language training for the commanders on key positions, concerning the interaction with NATO and of the personnel from the deployable forces including the forces earmarked for PSO as well.

# 7. Defence and Armed Forces Planning

 7.1. Defence and Armed Forces Planning System The defence planning is a process directed on defining and providing the necessary manpower, financial and material resources, as well as their allocation for the purposes of neutralizing the risks and threats and for ensuring the national security and defence of the country. This includes development of plans and programs in the areas of the collective security and defence, international military cooperation and adherence to the obligations derived from international acts Bulgaria has endorsed. It rests on the following documents: the National Security Concept, the Military Doctrine of the Republic of Bulgaria; the Military Strategy and other strategic concepts; the White Paper of Defence; directives, plans and programmes for establishment and development, training and employment of the Armed Forces, the economy, the population and the defence infrastructure; the wartime state plan and the territorial defence plan.  The Council of Ministers directs and coordinates the national defence planning, approves the plans for organizational establishment of the Armed Forces, mobilization plans, as well as the territorial defence plan and approves the proposed by the Minister of Defence decision for conducting a strategic survey of the defence.  The defence planning and the Armed Forces development rest on the consideration that the main military challenges to the military aspect of the national security are connected with the ongoing and potential conflicts in the region and the continent and the general global trends in the security and defence areas.  The defence planning is conducted in accordance and based on the political goals and priorities, approved by the defined institutions authorized in the Constitution, and the available national resources.  The defence planning is integrated goal-, approach- and time-conditioned process.  The integrity is provided by the elaboration of a system of planning documents in accordance with the Concept for planning, programming and budgeting system in the Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces.  The Plan for Organizational Establishment and Development of the Ministry of Defence is the most important one. It gives birth to the plans for organizational establishment of the Armed Forces, and plans for international cooperation and NATO integration as well. Their implementation is ensured by programmes for management and development of the human resources, the social policy, the medical support, management of the material assets, financial resources, development of the military infrastructure, etc.  The General Staff of the Bulgarian Army develops the plans and programs for establishment, training, readiness and employment of the Armed Forces in accordance with the guidelines of the Military Doctrine and the MSRB. The

# main objective of the long-term planning process is the prognostication and documentation of all defence budget needs.  The main direction of the planning system is the introduction of Planning, Programming and Budgeting System compatible with the approved systems of the Allies and the gradual transition from functional to program budgeting.  Some specific long-term programmes in the main areas of application of Plan 2004 and MAP have been developed and adopted since 2000. The priority programmes are determined by the Minister of Defence and are directed on improvement of the motivation and the standard of living of the servicemen, development of the Deployable Forces, implementation of the MAP, legal basis adaptation with NATO norms, language training of the servicemen, etc. The long-term 6-year planning is in effect since 2001, covering the principal areas of the Reform and the approved for implementation short- and midterm Partnership Goals. 

 7.2. Operational Planning System The operational planning is coordinated joint staff process for determining the best method for fulfillment of specific mission or for planning possible future tasks. Decision-making rests on thorough effective situation analysis, using professional knowledge, logic and arguments, and evaluation.  As a result of the planning process the staff reaches an optimal decision for implementation of tactical, operational and strategic missions and tasks after analyzing some possible Courses of Action in respect with all the possible enemy Courses of Action.  There are two types of planning - preliminary and contingency.  The preliminary planning is conducted in peacetime (without the existence of imminent threats) through stage by stage and hierarchical working process comprising periods of different length. It rests on prognosis of the political and military conditions, that would exist when the plan is to be implemented.  The contingency planning is used for development of operational plans for the purposes of conducting pending operation or crisis management activities. It rests on the current events and is conducted at time limited extreme situations. The developed plan during the preliminary planning serves as foundation for the operational plan elaborated during the crisis.  The imperatives of the planning of the employment of the Armed Forces in the whole range of their missions as assigned by the Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria, the National Security Concept, the Law on Defense and Armed Forces and the Military Doctrine are the MSRB, the doctrines, concepts, preliminary plans, the State General Wartime Plan and the current plans.

# Conclusion The Military Security is a necessity for implementing the national ideals and vital interests of the country. It is defined by the status of the military-strategical and military-political situation and the national defence capabilities, when there is no possibility for involving the country in a military conflict. The Military Security relies on stable economy, developed infrastructure, functioning social sector and sufficient military power.  The Republic of Bulgaria adopts the European and Euro-Atlantic defence and security values and considers its National Security directly related with the regional and European security while taking into account the created conditions for globalization of cooperation and synchronization in the military matters and actively participates in the building-up the joint European security and defence architecture, which backbone is provided by NATO and EU. The decision of the Republic of Bulgaria to apply for full NATO membership requires the adoption of adequate legislative basis and the accomplishment of specified acts for enhancing the interoperability of the Bulgarian Army with the Armies of the NATO member-states.  The MSRB implies and further develops the postulates of the National Security Concept and the Military Doctrine of the Republic of Bulgaria. It will be revised in accordance with the changes in the military-political and military-strategical environment and in the considerations on the establishment, development and employment of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria. The implementation of the Reform and the invitation to NATO membership as well will substantially amend the parameters of the macro-frame of application of the current Military Strategy of the Republic of Bulgaria.
