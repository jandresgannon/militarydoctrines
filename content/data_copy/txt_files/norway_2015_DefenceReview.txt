### Norwegian Armed Forces in transition

**STR ATEGIC DEFENCE REVIEW BY**

**THE NORWEGIAN CHIEF OF DEFENCE**

**ABRIDGED VERSION**


-----

Introduction
by the Chief of Defence
# 1

In the course of 2014 the security
­situation in Europe changed, ­bringing
once again to the fore the need to
­prioritise the defence of Norway and its
allies against ­aggressive actions or attack.


**This need was confirmed at the NATO sum-**
mit in Wales in September 2014. The new security
situation and NATO’s priorities provide the starting
point for my recommendations regarding the further development of the Norwegian Armed Forces
set out in this Strategic Defence Review.
I give priority to the capacity of the Norwegian
Armed Forces to carry out their most important and
most challenging missions. The Armed Forces must,
within the NATO context, serve as a deterrent to
action on the part of any adversary. Therefore, the
Norwegian Armed Forces must stand as a first line of
defence for NATO, capable of rapid armed response to
confront an aggressor on Norwegian territory while
awaiting Allied reinforcements. Allied and national
defence plans form the basis for defining the capabilities required by the Norwegian Armed Forces in
order to carry out their assignments.
The force structure I recommend fulfils the tasks
described in the Minister of Defence’s letter of October 2014 formally requesting a Strategic Defence
Review. I have placed special emphasis on greater
agility and responsiveness, increased preparedness
and reinforced manning at a number of units.
It is vital to ensure early warning about threats against
Norway, and to this end I give high priority to the Intelligence Service. Military presence in Finnmark must be
increased. Furthermore, I recommend strengthening
the organisation relating to the F-35 multirole fighter in
order to maximise return on investment and to make
the new fighters a key weapon platform for a diversity
of operations. I recommend boosting our capabilities
to communicate in real time and to transmit targeting
data between sensors and weapons platforms to support F-35 operations. There is also a need to reinforce
protective measures for infrastructure that is critical to
Norwegian defence capabilities. The Special Operations Forces are given organic helicopters, which will
also be important for police preparedness.


Strategic Defence
Review Framework

# 2

**This Strategic Defence Review is based on the letter of 1 October 2014 from the**
Norwegian Minister of Defence to the Chief of Defence formally requesting a review.
The review is part of the input to a new long-term plan for the Norwegian defence
sector to be presented by the Government in the spring of 2016.


In her letter requesting a review, the Minister of
Defence asked me to provide recommendations
based on a compensated, 2015-level budget. I was
also to indicate priorities on a budget beyond 0.5
per cent annual growth, and this forms the basis for
my recommendations.
The recommended force structure will not cost
more than continuing with the existing structure.
I recommend phasing in or strengthening certain
capabilities, while de-prioritising some and phasing
out others, to achieve a reasonably sized yet suitable
first line of defence of Norway. However, both the
agreed-on structure and the recommended first line
of defence entail a markedly higher cost than the
current budget allows, even when implementing
the proposed efficiency-raising measures that represent NOK 22 billion in savings over a 20-year period.
I have also outlined the repercussions for defence capabilities if the current budget level is to be continued.
This Strategic Defence Review emphasises making
use of the defence sector’s competencies. Armed Forces specialist circles and planning staffs have provided
input and analysis, and the employees’ organisations
have been involved along the way and in related
discussions. I wish to commend the employees for
their thorough assessments and constructive input
that have helped to shape the final review document.
The Chief of Defence’s Senior Leadership Group has
discussed the review and unified Armed Forces leadership supports the recommendations.
This Strategic Defence Review provides a sound
basis for the political discussion regarding which
defence capabilities Norway should possess and
what risks we as a nation are willing to take.

**Norwegian Chief of Defence**


**In the formal request letter, the Minister**
**of Defence asked for defence-sector in-**
**put in the following areas in particular:**

**PRIORITISING CAPABILITY TO**

5

**CARRY OUT THE MOST IMPOR-**
**TANT AND CHALLENGING MISSIONS**

The most demanding challenge facing the
Norwegian Armed Forces is to defend Norway and its allies within the framework of
NATO against threats and aggressive actions.
This should form the foundation for any
potential targeting and prioritisation of the
defence force structure.

**STRENGTHENING PREPARED-**

5

**NESS AND CAPACITY TO BUILD**
**UP FORCES**

The current security situation calls for a review
of the state of preparedness within the Armed
Forces. It is unrealistic to base defence planning on an assumption of lengthy warning
time before crises occur in the areas adjacent
to Norway. It is necessary to assess the implications of the increased need for readiness and
to seek ways of heightening the ready status
of the Armed Forces. Logistics and materiel
readiness and civil-sector support in times of
crisis or war must also be assessed.

**FURTHER DEVELOPING A DEFENCE**

5

**TAILORED TO THE ALLIANCE**

The Armed Forces are to cooperate closely
with Norway’s allies and assist in Allied crisismanagement operations.


**PROMOTING DEVELOPMENT OF A**

5

**MODERN, TECHNOLOGICALLY**
**ADVANCED ARMED FORCES SECTOR**

The Armed Forces are to continue and in certain
areas boost their investments in new technology that facilitates new and more effective ways
to complete missions. This applies in particular
to surveillance and intelligence in Norwegian
spheres of interest, but also in areas such as
firepower and protection.

**ENSURING A COST-EFFECTIVE**

5

**AND SUSTAINABLE ARMED**
**FORCES STRUCTURE**

The Armed Forces are to identify necessary
measures within their structure, personnel
and competencies, operations and investments. Measures must include coordination
with other agencies in the Armed Forces
sector to ensure implementation of futureoriented, cost-effective schemes. In his
input, the Chief of Defence is to give special
weight to recommendations relating to military establishments and support structure
and the management and staff structure.

**DEVELOPING MULTINATIONAL**

5

**CO­OPERATION WHERE**

**­APPROPRIATE**

Among our allies, there is increasing awareness of the need for more and better-integrated multinational solutions. There is a need for
military assessments of how to realise the full
potential of multinational solutions while at
the same time strengthening existing cooperation with our allies and partners.


**FULFILLING NEEDS FOR FUTURE**

5

**PERSONNEL AND COMPETENCIES**

It is essential to meet the Armed Forces’
staffing needs and ensure adequate recruitment of qualified personnel for operational
positions. The Norwegian Chief of Defence
is asked to provide input on how to implement a new personnel scheme, including
a future personnel structure, and to identify the ramifications for the Armed Forces’
educational and training system.

**FACILITATING EFFECTIVE**

5

**CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARDS**
**SOCIETAL SECURITY**

The Chief of Defence is to assess how to target the Armed Forces’ capacities to ensure
their relevance for societal security, as well as
the degree to which this task should, in certain areas, determine the scope of the Armed
Forces’ activities. The balance between promoting societal security and carrying out the
Armed Forces’ primary missions in relation to
the security of the realm must also be assessed.

**The review is to identify potential devi-**
**ations within various financial trajecto-**
**ries, including a compensated, 2015-level**
**budget and a budget with 0.5 per cent real**
**annual growth. Additionally, the Chief of**
**Defence is asked to provide his prioriti-**
**sations if the Armed Forces are given re-**
**sources beyond a budget of 0.5 per cent**
**real annual growth.**

**CHANGED DEFENCE AND SECURITY**
**­SITUATION**

Norway finds itself in a more demanding security situation, and new challenges within
NATO’s adjacent areas actualise changes
in defence policy. We must guard against

|threats, including conventional and asym metrical challenges, hybrid warfare, cyber-at tacks, terrorism and the growth of extremism. The situation in the High North is also changing, due in part to the region’s geo political and military strategic importance to Russia. Nuclear weapons are of high priority in the current modernisation of Russia’s mili tary forces, and the bases for many of Russia’s strategic ballistic missiles are located on the Kola Peninsula. We must presume that this modernisation of operative capability will continue. In addition, the country has shown increasing willingness to use military force against its neighbouring countries. Although Russia is currently not viewed as a direct threat to Norway, the possibility cannot be ruled out that Norway may be drawn into a confilct because of its geographical signifi cance near Russia’s strategic nuclear weapons or in support of Allied forces pursuant to NATO Article 5. The heightened tension of the po litical situation between Russia and the West adds to this uncertainty and unpredictability. Norwegian security and defence policy is based on membership of NATO, which must have adequate combative strength to deter potential adversaries.

ments, and the Norwegian Armed Forces
are NATO’s first line of defence. The Armed
Forces must therefore constitute a first line
of defence that is both relevant and credible.

**STATUS OF NORWEGIAN ARMED**
**­FORCES’ OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY**

The main objective for the current long-term


period has been to continue to develop a
capable force and strengthen the Armed
Forces’ capacity to perform its assigned missions. There is much within the Armed Forces
that is successful: the personnel are highly
motivated, training and exercises are performed at a high level, and daily operations,
both domestically and internationally, are
carried out in a highly satisfactory manner.
Ageing materiel, however, poses a challenge to fulfilling missions; there is a need
for renewal and it will entail high maintenance costs. A maintenance backlog and a
lack of replacement parts lead to reduced
operational availability. In certain areas the
Armed Forces also lack personnel and certain kinds of competency, particularly in the
Home Guard, Air Force and Navy.
Vital parts of the defence structure lack the
agility, responsiveness and resilience required
by major changes around us. The previous assumptions about early warning have changed,
necessitating greater readiness, agility, responsiveness, presence and mobility.

**FINANCIAL BASELINE**

We have defined a financial reference framework or baseline for this review by calculating
the costs of continuing the agreed-on structure in a 20-year perspective (2015–2034). The
baseline has been calculated and detailed using the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment’s tools for long-term structural cost
calculations. The same tool has been used in
the other structural calculations in this review.
A key element of the calculations is future
defence-specific cost growth (see fact box in
Chapter 2 of the Strategic Defence Review’s full
Norwegian version). Both operational and investment costs increase as a result of the need
to maintain the Armed Forces’ relative impact.
The Chief of Defence therefore proposes that
this demonstrated real growth in defence costs
is included as part of the defence planning. To


support long-term balance between missions,
structure and resources, the defence-specific
cost growth must be recouped.
The financial baseline confirms that the Chief
of Defence has a difficult starting point for his
Strategic Defence Review. Compared with a
2015-level budget, the agreed-on structure
is estimated to require funding of roughly
NOK 180 billion over 20 years. However, this
structure will not meet the defence and security policy challenges described in the Norwegian Minister of Defence’s formal request.
The financial challenges for the agreed-on
structure are unevenly distributed over the
period. From today to 2020 the increase in
demand will run to roughly NOK 39 billion.
In the short term, the challenge is primarily
related to the costs of operating the agreed-on
structure in accordance with the current ambitions. Among other things, the cumulative
**backlog in materiel maintenance and spare**
**parts will amount to a total of NOK 2.5 billion.**
A lower annual budget level resulting from
the Government’s debureaucratisation and
**efficiency-raising reform has been taken**
into account. If nothing is invested back into
the defence sector, the effects of the reform
overall will amount to over NOK 33 billion
over 20 years.
Real growth in the cost of procuring and
operating modern military materiel, the de**fence-specific cost growth of maintaining**
**defence capabilities, comprises over NOK 50**
billion for this 20-year period.
In the longer term, the challenges are related to very cost-intensive investment projects
and the corresponding increased need for
funds for operation. The increased demand
related to operating, modernising and renewing the agreed-on structure comprises more
than NOK 90 billion over 20 years.

Framework
for the review
# 2

### THE NORWEGIAN ARMED FORCES IN A NEW SITUATION

The key elements on which the Chief of

­Defence’s recommendations are based are
changes in the security situation, the opera-
tional capability of the Norwegian forces,
and the financial framework within
which the Armed Forces must
carry out their missions.


-----

pabilities are necessary situational awareness,
effective command and control, and combative capability. The next three prioritised
capabilities are protection, logistic support

A defence built on the concept of deterrence
must be able to discourage potential aggressors from using military force against Norway.
Norway is dependent on Allied support to
resist military aggression, which is why it is
essential that the Armed Forces can operate
integrally with Allied forces. Allied support
is part of the threshold that acts as a credible Norwegian deterrence. NATO’s priorities
are thus meaningful for how Norway should
design and dimension the Armed Forces’
capabilities; the Chief of Defence has emphasised this in his recommended structure.
The figure on page 9 illustrates how the
collective military capabilities of the NATO
members form the defence cornerstone in
the event of aggression that may activate
Article 5 of the NATO treaty. The next level,
_reinforcement, involves the capability to re-_
inforce a NATO area with military forces. This
capability requires plans for staging forces
and the recipient country’s ability to receive
and transport those forces to the areas of
operation. The changed security situation
requires the Armed Forces to update and
detail their capability to receive Allied re
The third level of deterrence is the national
first line of defence. Norway does not have Allied forces stationed on its territory in peacetime, and therefore Norwegian Armed Forces
constitute the first line of defence. For this
first line of defence to serve as a credible


deterrent, Norway must be able to exert
immediate and effective resistance in the
course of an attack. Above all this will require
reduced response time and greater agility
and responsiveness. It is fundamentally important for a first line of defence to have no
serious weaknesses that an adversary can
readily exploit, and to possess a broad array of capabilities and tactics, rooted in the
development of the existing structure. The
current size of the Armed Forces makes it necessary to combine military presence with the
capability to confront the enemy wherever
the aggressive actions or attack may come.
Presence is critical to ensure continuous
national control. In addition, responsiveness
and combative capability must be strong in
every domain and area that is not covered on
a daily basis. The future Armed Forces must
be capable of confronting and striking back
at an aggressor.
Intelligence and surveillance comprise the
uppermost level of the deterrence threshold and are critical for identifying, as early
as possible, enemy build-up for the use of
force against Norway. Intelligence and surveillance must be robust, since the information collected forms the basis for deploying
Norwegian Armed Forces capabilities and
implementing reinforcement plans.

**OTHER UNDERLYING FACTORS**

**Promoting development of a modern and**
**technologically advanced Armed Forces**
New technology remains a cornerstone in
the development of the Armed Forces since
it provides the means for carrying out missions more effectively and with greater force.

###### “The Armed Forces need stronger intelligence, surveillance and situational ­awareness capabilities.” 


Applying modern technology also helps to
create a preventative deterrent for adversaries.
In this review, great emphasis is placed on
equipping the Armed Forces with capabilities
to meet tomorrow’s challenges. The technology includes unmanned systems that strengthen surveillance capabilities and reduce the
risk of casualties and injury to our personnel;
enhanced satellite-based capacity for intelligence, surveillance and communication;
and long-range, precision-guided weapons
for responding to attack over long distances.

**Ensuring a cost-effective and sustainable**
**Armed Forces structure**
Regardless of budgetary level, there is a need
for continual restructuring and streamlining in order to shape the Norwegian Armed
Forces in a long-term, economically sustainable perspective. Efficiency-raising measures
are primarily implemented in the following
main areas:

**Consolidation of military establishments**
**and activities: The Armed Forces’ base struc-**
ture is neither adequately cost-effective nor
operationally optimal. This review therefore
emphasises cost-effective solutions for the
Armed Forces’ overall activities.

**Reductions in management, staff, admin-**
**istration and training: The Chief of Defence**
will streamline the governance and management model through improved work processes, more framework objectives and fewer
reporting requirements. There is a need for
a number of consolidating and co-locating
measures to raise efficiency and reduce the
number of person-years needed.

**Improving processes and cooperation for**
**support services: For the Norwegian Defence**
Logistics Organisation, Joint Medical Services and Cyber Defence, it will be a priority to
enhance the efficiency of support services
through utilisation of civil-sector resources.


**Personnel and competency**

**Personnel: An Other Ranks (OR) system is**
being implemented. Along with changes in
the Act relating to Armed Forces personnel,
the introduction of OR will help to promote the
best possible balance within the personnel and
competency structure to safeguard the Armed
Forces’ operational capabilities and operations.
The plans are to introduce a personnel structure
that increases the number of specialists while
reducing the number of officers.

**Armed Forces education and training:**
Current training in the Armed Forces is of
high quality and recruits effectively. Available
training is fragmented, however, and is carried out at too many locations. Education and
training must be streamlined and may in the
future be consolidated where this can yield
financial or professional returns.

**Compulsory military service: Gender-neu-**
tral compulsory national military service will
be continued in accordance with the Armed
Forces’ operational needs. National service
will be standardised at a 12-month service
period. A trial scheme adopting an 18-month
national service will be evaluated.

**Reserve personnel: The current scheme**
for reserve forces for operative units will be
refined. The scheme entails that each of Norway’s military branches maintains access to its
own reserves in the force structure, including
for training and exercises.

**Multinational cooperation**
The Norwegian Armed Forces currently participate in extensive multinational cooperation within the framework of NATO, the EU,
NORDEFCO and other bi-/multilateral organisations. This cooperation encompasses
joint participation in operations, joint procurement of materiel, and close cooperation
on education, training and exercises. This
type of cooperation has yielded many op

erational and financial benefits and should
hold priority in the future as well. The Chief
of Defence sees no immediate new returns
emerging unless there is greater political
will for multinational cooperation.

**The Total Defence Concept and effective**
**contributions towards societal security**
The Total Defence Concept comprises society’s support for the Norwegian Armed Forces as well as Armed Forces support of civil
society. There is a need to further develop
and update the concept due to the importance this review gives to armed deterrence
and the role as first line of defence for NATO.

**Civil support for the Armed Forces: In**
the event of crisis or war, the Armed Forces
will need support from civil society in the
form of goods, services and access to infrastructure beyond what the Armed Forces
currently have at their disposal. Civil-sector
support will be necessary for maintaining
relevant defence capabilities within realistic
financial constraints and for receiving and
supporting Allied reinforcements in a crisis.

**The Armed Forces’ support for civil soci-**
**ety: The main principle that the Armed Forces**
are to contribute their resources as needed upon request should still apply. No new
military capabilities or structures are recommended established for the specific purpose
of carrying out support for civil society, but
new helicopters for the Special Forces may
also serve as an important resource for the
performance of police duties.

### A BALANCED  DEFENCE

The Chief of Defence recommends a re-organ­i­

sation of the military defence structure in
response to today’s security challenges. The
new structure makes it possible to execute
the most challenging missions and at
the same time strengthens the
Armed Forces as part
of NATO.


-----

**The Chief of Defence’s recommended structure will enhance the Norwegian**
­Armed Forces’ capability for early warning and up-to-date situational awareness.
This will provide the basis for planning, leading and executing operations with
­national and Allied forces. Investment in necessary information infrastructure
will be effectuated. The various units’ responsiveness, combative strength and
­resilience will be enhanced through increased presence in high-priority areas.
­Procurement of improved air defence systems provides better protection of
­military bases, units and Allied reinforcements. The provision of new Special
­Forces helicopters will help to promote societal security.

Infrastructure (INI). In addition, the head of
Cyber Defence will have responsibility for
the Armed Forces’ ICT training. Operations
and training will continue, consolidated under a single unit.

**The Joint Medical Services are further**

developed to support the Armed Forces’ operational needs. The strategic medical
capacities are critical and marginal and must
be utilised in a coordinated civilian-military
perspective and through multinational cooperation. A coordination concept with the civilian public health service during times of peace,
crisis, disaster and war is to be developed.

### Developing the operational structure


### Overview of Norwegian Armed Forces operational structure


**Norwegian Army**

**Brigade North is to be modernised**
through procurement of various
types of advanced combat and support vehicles. The Army’s presence
and combative strength in Finnmark
and Troms counties will be expanded
by strengthening the Border Guard
with one Ranger unit, establishing a
mechanised element from Brigade
North at Porsangermoen camp and
enhancing its mechanised presence
in Troms. Overall this increases the
availability of combat units that maintain a high state of readiness in the
northernmost counties.

**Norwegian Home Guard**

**Increased presence and operational**
capability in the High North are to be
prioritised. The Home Guard-17 district in Finnmark will be reinforced
to safeguard territorial responsibility and receive reinforcements. The
district will also be given capacity for
anti-tank and electronic warfare. Rapid response units will be reinforced
from 3 000 to 3 250 and will be able
to mobilise rapidly to other parts of
the country. The area structure will
be reduced and dimensioned in accordance with prioritised objectives.
The Home Guard-11 district and Naval Home Guard will be disbanded,
levels of ambition differentiated and
management, staff and administration adjusted accordingly.

**Norwegian Navy**

**Resilience and presence are to be**
enhanced through more crews and
a higher activity level in the High
North. The Navy will concentrate
base activity around Haakonsvern
and Ramsund. Capacity for mine
countermeasures will develop new


concepts, while the Tactical Boat
Squadron and Coastal Ranger Command will be dismantled. Some of the
competence from the latter will be
transferred to other capacities. The
corvettes will be continued until F-35
fighter aircraft are operational with
Joint Strike Missiles. The Coast Guard
is to be prioritised and dimensioned
for peacetime assignments.

**Norwegian Air Force**

**Capabilities for preparedness and**
producing operational air power are
to be further developed for highintensity operations. The Air Force
will be consolidated around establishments with high combat value for
Norwegian and Allied forces. Highintensity combat capabilities will be
strengthened and agility and responsiveness enhanced. Firepower will be
enhanced by phasing in the F-35 fighter aircraft. Manned and unmanned aircraft will ensure effective surveillance.
New air defence systems and airspace
sensors will provide better situational
awareness and protect weapons systems and key national assets.

**Norwegian Special Operation**
**Forces (SOF)**

**The SOF’s leadership will be con-**
tinued in close affiliation with Norwegian Armed Forces leadership.
The SOF will be further developed
with two combat units at Rena, one
at Haakonsvern and two reserve
units. In principle these units may
be used seamlessly between different missions and preparedness assignments and are to be based on
coordinated selection and training.
There are plans underway to implement helicopters for SOF operations,
operated by the Air Force.

### Consolidation of military establishments and activities



**RECOMMENDED STRUCTURE FOR**
**NORWEGIAN MILITARY ESTABLISHMENTS**

**Concentrating logistic activity along the country’s main communication/**
**ICT arteries achieves economies of scale as well as logistic, ICT-related**
**and operational synergies.**

This will offer major advantages with regard to the most efficient reception
of Allied forces in a crisis situation and their further transport and logistic
support to areas of operation. This long-term consolidation will be necessary to realise the recommended structure.

**NORWEGIAN MILITARY ESTABLISHMENTS RECOMMENDED CONTINUED**


**The Norwegian Armed Forces are**
currently distributed across a substantial number of locations, and this structure for military
establishments is neither cost-effective nor
operationally optimal. Major, cost-intensive
investment projects in the current and coming long-term planning periods are delaying
necessary renovation of property, buildings
and facilities. As a result the buildings are deteriorating and maintenance costs are increasing. On this basis, the following objectives for
Armed Forces establishments and activities
have been formulated:

Steps must be taken to facilitate cost-effective solutions for collective defencerelated activity.

Armed Forces activity must be concentrated into fewer areas and near the country’s
main communication arteries.

Efforts must be launched to promote moredynamic specialist environments.

The need for flexibility must be given adequate consideration to ensure that future
Norwegian military establishments can
be further developed in accordance with
future demands.

### Summary of the recommended Norwegian military structure

**The recommended military structure meets the challenges**
­described in the Norwegian Minister of Defence’s formal request.


**Recommended**
**­investments within**
**an expanded budget**
**framework**
If the budget framework
is expanded beyond the
para­meters of the mode­
rate structure, the following capabilities are recommended, in order of priority:

#### 1
Extend anti-submarine capability in new surveillance
platforms, i.e. by procuring
an adequate fleet of maritime patrol aircraft.

#### 2
Extend a structure of six
submarines and procure six
new ones starting in 2025.

#### 3
Strengthen ground-force
capability and presence in
Norway by creating a new
brigade with appurtenant
material.

#### 4
Procure new helicopters
for the Army.

#### 5
Increase the number of
precision-guided weapons.


**The military structure described in the pre-**
ceding pages represents a marked departure from
Norway’s current capable force. The capability to
defend Norway and its allies against threats, aggressive actions and attack within the NATO framework
is substantially strengthened. The recommendation
attaches particular importance to significantly enhanced agility and responsiveness, heightened preparedness and reinforced manning at several units.
The structure gives Norway a national, independent
ability to tackle the most difficult challenges related
to armed attack for a limited timeframe. In addition to
enhancing the Norwegian Armed Forces’ agility and
responsiveness, the structure satisfies the need for
presence in important areas with advanced capabilities.
In addition, the structure can accommodate challenges related to coercive diplomacy backed up by
military measures, upholding national sovereignty,
exercising national authority, terrorism and international operations.
Together the recommended measures provide a
balanced defence whose structure is based on strict
prioritisation and designed for facing the most demanding challenges. Moreover, this re-organisation
of the Norwegian Armed Forces structure makes it
possible to build up capacities by means of additional
initiatives and prioritisation via the defence budgets.

**FINANCIAL PREREQUISITES**

The Chief of Defence recommends an Armed Forces
with a built-in balance between missions, structure and
budget and the defence-specific cost growth. The cost
calculation of the recommended structure shows a need
for increased funding compared to the 2015-level budget
and includes additional funding of new F-35 fighter aircraft and Joint Strike Missiles, with room to accommodate a continuation of the Government’s requirements
relating to debureaucratisation and efficiency-raising.
Changes to the Armed Forces should be implemented speedily in order to achieve the necessary operational capacity, responsiveness and cost-effective
operation as quickly as possible.
For the 2017–2020 period, increased operational


costs comprise NOK 10 billion, of which NOK 720
million is personnel-related restructuring costs. Investments in priority capabilities – such as satellites,
surveillance and intelligence systems, modernisation
of tanks and combat vehicles, procurement of combat
and area air defence and information infrastructure
– comprise NOK 21 billion. This also includes NOK 2.3
billion for backlog in materiel maintenance and spare
parts. Investments in property, buildings and facilities
amount to NOK 4 billion, bringing the total funding
increase needed during the period to NOK 35 billion.
The Chief of Defence recommends increasing the
defence budget framework by roughly NOK 2.7 billion
in 2017, and increasing it thereafter to a level in 2020
that is NOK 11.5 billion above the current budget. Overall the recommendation corresponds to an increase
of just under NOK 30 billion in the 2017–2020 period
and will require adjustment in the timing of investments in order to postpone parts of the escalation in
funding needed to the period after 2024.
For the 2021–2028 period, increased operational
costs comprise NOK 41 billion. Investments in priority
capabilities – such as submarines, strategic intelligence
resources, helicopters for the Special Operation Forces,
armoured and light armoured vehicles, surveillance
and intelligence aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, upgrades of transport planes and frigates, and procurement of new Coast Guard vessels – comprise NOK 49
billion. In total the increase in funding for this period
is calculated to be NOK 90 billion.
It is recommended that the defence budget for the
2021–2028 period is based on a level that in 2021 is
NOK 11.6 billion higher than the current budget, with
an increase thereafter of NOK 100 million each year
until 2028. This adds up to an increase of just under
NOK 96 billion for the 2021–2028 period.
The Norwegian Chief of Defence recommends efficiency measures that together will total NOK 14 billion
(cumulative) from 2017 to 2028, and NOK 22 billion for
the entire 20-year period.
The cost estimate for the Norwegian Armed Forces
structure recommended by the Chief of Defence calls
for a total escalation in funding needed of roughly
NOK 175 billion in the 2015–2034 period.

ducing defence capability entails a very real risk.
If the Norwegian defence structure is reduced
from the recommended level outlined in Chapter
4, Norway’s first-line defence will be diminished
to the point of completely changing the character
of Norway’s defence strategy. When weaknesses
are created within what is designated as a first
line of defence, risk-reducing measures from
Norway’s allies must compensate for the short-
comings of the national structure. This would

require either having Allied forces stationed on
Norwegian territory on a daily basis, or relying on
the very rapid airborne arrival of combat-ready
Allied reinforcements to the front line.

radical changes. A continued 2015-level budget

Armed Forces structure. In this event, the Chief
of Defence would advise prioritising capabili-

tions of continuing at the current budget level.

These measures highlight the resulting unavoid-

### Overall organisation and operational capability
**Limiting Norwegian Armed Forces capabilities to accommodate a cost level lower**
than the current structure will trigger far-reaching changes. **Overview of Norwegian Armed Forces operational structure in 2024**


**Neither a zero-growth budget based on the 2015**
level nor a budget trajectory of 0.5 per cent annual real growth
is viewed as adequate for maintaining long-term financial sustainability. The extension of a compensated, 2015-level budget
entails a gradual, steady downscaling of the Armed Forces.
This will require ongoing assessments of which capabilities,
from an operations standpoint, are most desirable to keep.
At the same time, decisions will have to be taken on decreasing activities or phasing out capabilities when the budget is
no longer adequate to maintain a sound operational level.
As with the recommended defence structure, peacetime
capability is to be maintained to exercise national authority and uphold national sovereignty. Strategic capabilities
for timely intelligence-gathering, surveillance and target
acquisition will be prioritised.
Capacity to safeguard Allied reinforcements will be prioritised as far as possible. It will be increasingly incumbent
on Allied forces to provide their own means of protection.
Even with reduced breadth of Armed Forces capabilities,
there is a need to enhance responsiveness, preparedness
and resilience in the remaining structural elements.
Norway can lower the risks inherent in its defence deficiencies by tailoring them to the capacity strengths that
NATO can offer at extremely short notice. Aircraft, and particularly fighters, is the capability that NATO can provide
most quickly, and which can provide a significant boost to
Allied combative strength in defence of Norway. As NATO’s
northern flank and neighbour to Russia, Norway will need
fighter aircraft on a daily basis. A national capability in this
area is therefore essential, but given a reduced level of ambition for the Norwegian Armed Forces, the number of F-35
fighter aircraft must be decreased.
At sea, the frigates with anti-submarine capability remain
relevant for protecting Allied reinforcements and represent
an asset in demand within NATO. The frigates’ long-range,
precision-guided weapons strengthen the Armed Forces’ role
in sea denial, i.e. preventing an enemy from gaining control over
an ocean area. Mine countermeasures must be developed as a
near-coast capability to safeguard reception of reinforcements.
Narrowing the scope for the Armed Forces structure means
significant reductions in operational units. Consequently,
there is less need for conscripts. This trend will continue
throughout the period and calls into question whether compulsory military service still has appreciable military value.
