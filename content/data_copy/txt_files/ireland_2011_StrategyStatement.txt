### MINISTERIAL FOREWORD

I welcome the publication of this Strategy Statement which sets out the

key strategies that will be pursued by the Department of Defence and

the Defence Forces over the period to 2015. A key focus is to ensure

that Defence Policy is responsive to emergent changes in the Defence

and Security environment and that the Defence Organisation retains

the capacity to fulfil all roles assigned, to the greatest extent possible.

The formulation and publication of a new White Paper on Defence is provided for in this Strategy

Statement. This will ensure that the Defence policy framework is optimised to meet future challenges.

As part of the process of developing a new White Paper, a Green Paper on Defence will be published.

This is intended to elicit a mature and informed debate and underpin a broad consultative process,

which will inform our future Defence policy.

The Defence Forces continue to deliver a wide variety of operational outputs at home, on an ongoing

basis, such as explosive ordnance disposal, maritime patrols, armed prison guards, helicopter support,

cash in transit escorts, etc. Many of these outputs go unseen by the majority of the general public but

remain a key part of our security framework. The Government is determined to maintain these

operational outputs, to the greatest extent possible.

The Government is also committed to restoring Ireland’s standing as a respected and influential

member of the European Union and as part of the wider international community. For more than half

a century, the accomplishments of the Defence Forces on overseas missions have brought great

honour to Ireland. It is something that we should be rightly proud of. Our continued participation in

international peace support operations underlines our intention to fulfil our international obligations.

The level of resourcing available over the coming years will present further challenges to the

maintenance of service delivery. This Strategy Statement reflects the realities that we are currently

experiencing and addresses the challenges facing the organisation in maintaining the required

capabilities and outputs. It charts a way forward that builds on the significant modernisation that has

been achieved over an extended period of time. I have no doubt that the Defence Organisation will

continue to deliver the further efficiencies that are required.

Following the completion of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in 2011, the Government

decided to maintain the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel. In response to

the revised strength ceiling of 9,500, a major re-organisation of the Defence Forces, including the

###### 3


-----

Reserve Defence Force, has been initiated and is reflected in this Strategy Statement. The aim of the

re-organisation is to ensure that the Defence Forces maximise their operational outputs, within the

reduced resource envelope.

I am determined to further explore the role that Defence can play in restoring our economy. I believe

that there is potential for private sector businesses to collaborate with our Defence establishment in

the area of innovation, research and development, business start ups and job creation. This initiative

will continue to be explored within the period of this Strategy Statement.

This Strategy Statement sets many targets which are ambitious but achievable. I look forward to

working closely with the Secretary General, the Chief of Staff and their respective personnel in the

organisation, both civil and military, whose combined efforts will be required to ensure delivery of the

stated objectives.

### FOREWORD

This Strategy Statement encompasses the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, which

have unique but complementary roles. This is reflected in the fact that the collective Defence

Organisation shares a common high level goal.

The High Level Goal of the Defence Organisation is:

_To provide for the military defence of the State, contribute to national and international peace and_

_security and fulfil all other roles assigned by Government._

In order to achieve this goal, the Organisation is tasked with a broad and diverse range of duties. On a

daily basis, the personnel of the Department and the Defence Forces can be called upon to deal with

matters of local, national and international dimensions. The opening section of this Strategy

Statement sets out a brief description of the roles of the organisation as much of the work done does

not come to public attention.

The period of this Strategy Statement will present many challenges. The achievement of the targets

which include those set for us by Government and by us on our own initiative, will result in greater

demands being made on reduced resources. The experience in recent years clearly indicates that the

modernisation and reform achieved by the Defence Organisation throughout the past decade has

resulted in greater efficiencies. The aim is to continue and progress these achievements into the

future.

The modernisation agenda which has been ongoing in the organisation for more than 10 years has

generated a degree of expertise and knowledge in this area. The culture to embrace change which

now exists throughout the organisation is a valuable asset to be utilised as we face the major task of

re-organising the Defence Forces to reflect the revised strength of 9,500 personnel. The outcome

from this task will be a significant milestone in the history of the Defence Forces.

The new White Paper on Defence will set out the policy framework for the next ten years. The

preparation of this document will entail a large commitment from within our own resources and the

co-operation of our colleagues and customers.

We acknowledge the contribution of all personnel, both civil and military who continue to provide the

organisation with a high standard of service. The requirements to deliver quality outputs with

reduced resources will continue to require determination, commitment and drive. We look forward to

###### 5

working with colleagues, customers and stakeholders, as we face the many challenges that lie ahead

in the period of this Strategy Statement.

###### POLICY CONTEXT

The White Paper on Defence (2000) sets out

the Government’s Defence Policy framework

and outlines the policy requirements for

Defence. It states:

“Having regard to the defence and security

environment, the Government’s policy for

defence will be aimed at ensuring that the

following requirements are met:


To maintain a military force structure

that provides a basis for responding

to any major change in Ireland’s

strategic circumstances in the

medium to long term, as well as

demonstrating an appropriate

commitment to national defence. 

To maintain a military force structure

capable of responding to requests to

provide aid to the civil power and in

that context, contributing to the

prevention of security challenges

from abroad including terrorism and

arms smuggling. 

To fulfil Ireland’s international and

regional responsibilities arising from

membership of the UN by providing a

range of military capabilities that can

effectively be employed to

participate in a broad range of

multinational peace support and

humanitarian relief operations. 


To demonstrate Ireland’s

commitment to European security by

having a suitable range of military

capabilities that can be used to make

appropriate contributions to regional

security missions authorised by the

UN.”

In addition, the White Paper outlined the

Government’s decision to utilise Defence

capabilities to deliver a broad range of other

services, which maximises the value for

money accrued from Defence capabilities.

These include provision of a Fishery Protection

Service, the provision of an Air Ambulance

Service to the HSE and the provision of

support to the civil authorities across a wide

range of contingencies, including assistance to

local authorities during severe weather crises

such as flooding.

###### DEFENCE ORGANISATION

The Defence Organisation has civil and

military elements, which work collaboratively

to ensure that the Minister and Government’s

requirements for Defence are delivered. The

elements of the Defence Organisation and

their associated roles are outlined below.


###### 7


-----

The Department of Defence comprises civil

and military elements with distinct but

complementary roles.

The primary role of the civil element of the

Department is to support the Minister as Head

of the Department, in particular by providing

policy advice and support on Defence matters.

The civil element of the Department of

Defence is central to the oversight and

management of the Defence Votes, the drive

for efficiency and the process of change,

formulating Defence policy, representing

Ireland at EU and international engagements

in Defence, defending against litigation and

providing a range of services critical to the

outputs of the Defence Forces.

The civil element also provides liaison

between the Defence Forces and other

Government Departments, public authorities,

the EU and public representatives. The

Secretary General is the Minister’s principal

defence policy adviser.

The Department also has responsibilities in

relation to Civil Defence and Emergency

Planning. The Office of Emergency Planning

(OEP) is a civil/military office within the

Department of Defence. OEP supports the

Minister in his role as Chairman of the

Government’s Task Force on Emergency

Planning. It also presents an annual report to

Government on Emergency Planning. The

office is also responsible for the operation of


the National Emergency Coordination Centre

(NECC).

Defence Forces Headquarters (DFHQ) is the

military element of the Department of

Defence, which is headed by the Chief of Staff,

who is the Minister’s principal military adviser.

It is focused on planning, managing,

formulating military advice, development, and

major strategic issues affecting the Defence

Forces, including ongoing modernisation and

transformation. DFHQ comprises a range of

military staffs, which have responsibilities

ranging from Defence Forces Strategic

Planning to Operations, Logistics and Human

Resource Management.

###### DEFENCE FORCES

The White Paper on Defence (2000) set out

the roles of the Defence Forces as follows:

__

_to defend the State against armed_

_aggression;_ _this_ _being_ _a_ _contingency,_

_preparations for its implementation will_

_depend_ _on_ _an_ _ongoing_ _Government_

_assessment of the security and defence_

_environment;_

__

_to aid the civil power (meaning in practice_

_to assist, when requested, the Garda_

_Síochána, who have primary responsibility for_

_law and order, including the protection of the_

_internal security of the State);_

__

_to participate in multinational peace_

_support,_ _crisis_ _management_ _and_

_humanitarian relief operations in support of_

_the United Nations and under UN mandate,_


###### 8


-----

_including_ _regional_ _security_ _missions_

_authorised by the UN;_

__

_to provide a fishery protection service in_

_accordance with the State’s obligations as a_

_member of the EU; and,_

__

_to carry out such other duties as may be_

_assigned to them from time to time, e.g._

_search and rescue, air ambulance service,_

_Ministerial air transport service, assistance on_

_the occasion of natural or other disasters,_

_assistance_ _in_ _connection_ _with_ _the_

_maintenance of essential services, assistance_

_in combating oil pollution at sea._

The Defence Forces are organised on

conventional military lines providing a

sufficiently flexible structure to carry out all

the roles assigned by Government. The

Defence Forces consist of a Permanent

Defence Force (PDF) and a Reserve Defence

Force (RDF). The former is a standing force

and provides the primary capabilities for

military operations at home and military

peace support operations abroad. The RDF

provides a contingent conventional military

capability to augment and assist the PDF in

situations where such additional capabilities

are required. In addition, civilian employees

are engaged throughout the Defence Forces,

to provide a range of general operative, trade

and other services, in military installations.

###### PERMANENT DEFENCE FORCE


The Permanent Defence Force (PDF) consists

of the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval

Service.

###### Army

The Army provides the land component of the

State’s Defence capabilities. The Army

currently provides the deployable military

capabilities for overseas peace support, crisis

management and humanitarian operations

augmented by personnel from the Air Corps

and Naval Service. On a day-to-day basis the

Army provides a broad range of operational

outputs. These include activities in support of

An Garda Síochána such as providing cash

escorts, prisoner escorts, explosive ordnance

disposal and prison security. The Army also

undertake tasks in support of the civil

authorities such as the provision of assistance

in severe weather crises and are an integral

part of the State’s response to many

contingencies. A major re-organisation has

been initiated which will encompass a

reduction in the number of Army Brigades

from three to two. The Defence Forces’

Training Centre (DFTC) and Defence Forces’

Logistics Base in the Curragh, Co. Kildare,

support the training and logistics functions for

the entire Defence Force.

###### Air Corps

As the air component of the Defence Forces,

the Air Corps provides air support capabilities


###### 9


-----

to the other components in carrying out their

roles. On a day-to-day basis the Air Corps

undertakes Army Support, Fishery Protection

Patrols, provides a Ministerial Air Transport

Service and operates an Air Ambulance

Service. The Air Corps routinely undertake

tasks such as providing air cover for cash in

transit operations and providing pilots and

technical support for the Garda Air Support

Unit. In addition, the Air Corps undertakes

approved operations in support of the civil

authorities.

The Air Corps is based at Casement

Aerodrome, Baldonnel, Dublin and consists of

an operational headquarters, two operational

wings, two support wings, the Air Corps

Training College, and a Communication and

Information Services Squadron. The

operational wings consist of a training/light

strike squadron, helicopter squadrons, a

maritime squadron, a transport squadron and

a fixed wing reconnaissance squadron. The

support wings are tasked with specialist

maintenance of the aircraft fleet and

administration and logistical support for the

Air Corps.

###### Naval Service

The Naval Service provides the maritime

component of the State’s Defence capabilities.

It is the State’s principal sea-going agency and

is tasked with a broad range of roles. On a day

to day basis, routine patrols are multi-tasked

to encompass security, safety and

surveillance, port security, fishery protection,

drug interdiction, pollution control and search


and rescue. The Fisheries Monitoring Centre

at the Naval Base is the designated national

centre with responsibility for monitoring all

fishing activity within the Irish Exclusive

Fishery Limits and all Irish fishing vessels

operating around the world. The Naval

Service is also a partner at the National

Maritime College and the Maritime Energy

Research Campus and Commerical Cluster

(MERC) at Cork. In addition, Naval Service

vessels have, on occasion, undertaken supply

and reconnaissance missions in support of

overseas peace support operations and

participated in foreign visits in support of Irish

trade and diplomacy.

The Naval Service is based at Haulbowline, Co.

Cork and has a flotilla of eight ships, an

operational headquarters, an operations

command, a logistical support command and a

Naval Service College.

###### RMATION GEOGRAPHIC 

 Reserve Defence Force

The Reserve Defence Force (RDF) consists of

the First Line Reserve, the Army Reserve and

the Naval Service Reserve. The RDF

contributes to Ireland’s defence capability by

providing a capacity to augment the PDF in

the event of a major crisis. The Army Reserve

and Naval Service Reserve undertake training

in preparation to assist the Permanent

Defence Force, when required.


###### 10


-----

#### MANDATE.

The Constitution of Ireland vests the right to

raise and maintain military or armed forces

exclusively in the Oireachtas and expressly

prohibits the raising and maintenance of any

other military or armed force for any purpose

whatsoever.

The Department of Defence was established

by the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 and

the Act assigns to the Department _“the_

_administration and business of the raising,_

_training,_ _organisation,_ _maintenance,_

_equipment,_ _management,_ _discipline,_

_regulation and control according to law of the_

_military defence forces”._

The Act provides that the Minister is ‘Head’ of

the Department. The Minister is assisted in

discharging his functions by the civil and

military elements of the Department. The

Secretary General is the “principal officer” of

the Department and is also appointed by the

Minister for Finance as the Accounting Officer

for all defence expenditure in accordance with

the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act,

1866. The authority, responsibility and

accountability of the Secretary General are

further elaborated in the Comptroller and

Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993 and

the Public Service Management Act, 1997.

The 1997 Act also requires the Secretary

General to prepare a Strategy Statement for


the Minister’s approval and an annual report

on performance.

The Defence Acts 1954 to 2011 provide the

legislative basis for the Defence Forces

(Óglaigh na hÉireann). The legislation

provides that Defence Forces Headquarters

(DFHQ) is the military element of the

Department of Defence. The Chief of Staff of

the Defence Forces heads DFHQ. As provided

for in the Act, the Minister has assigned duties

to the Chief of Staff for which he is directly

responsible to the Minister. Also provided for

in the Act and with the approval of the

Minister, the Chief of Staff has, in turn,

delegated responsibility for certain duties to

the Deputy Chief of Staff (Operations) and to

the Deputy Chief of Staff (Support).

The Act also provides for delegation by the

Minister of military command to General

Officers Commanding the Brigades, the

Defence Forces Training Centre, and the Air

Corps. Flag Officer Commanding the Naval

Service has been delegated similar

responsibilities in respect of the Naval Service.

In practice, matters relating to command are

normally channelled through the Chief of

Staff. In effect, this means that day-to-day

operational control of the Defence Forces

rests with the Chief of Staff for which he is

directly responsible to the Minister.


###### 11


-----

Defence policy and the resourcing and

implementation of that policy are grounded

on a realistic and ongoing assessment of the

defence and security environment. Many

factors, both national and international, can

influence the delivery of the defence mission.

Chief among these are the defence and

security situations at home and abroad.

###### DOMESTICSECURITY ENVIRONMENT.

Dissident Republican Paramilitaries continue

to pose a threat and there is a requirement for

continued vigilance. While it is assessed that

currently they have limited capability there

are indications of concerted efforts by these

groupings to develop their capability. They

remain intent on disrupting the ongoing

normalisation process.

At present, in terms of significant damage

and/or casualties, it is considered that the

main international threat to domestic security

arises from a terrorist act or a major

emergency incident (e.g. nuclear accident,

medical epidemic, etc.). However, the direct

threat to Ireland as a target of international

terrorism is currently assessed as low. On the

other hand, it is clear that Ireland could be

used as a base by terrorist organisations. The

asymmetric nature of the terrorist threat

requires all security agencies to reflect on

current counter-terrorism strategies and to


develop a fully integrated approach on-island

and with international partners.

In relation to maritime operations, the

expansion of the area of State jurisdiction to

encompass the continental shelf together with

engagement in counter narcotic operations in

areas of the high seas present new

operational challenges for the Defence

Forces. These challenges are of particular

relevance in the context of providing for the

security of the State, the provision of maritime

law enforcement services and other services

associated with State obligations and

enhanced economic activity in areas of State

jurisdiction.

###### INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ENVIRONMENT.

The report of the UN Secretary General’s High

Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and

Change entitled ‘A More Secure World: Our

Shared Responsibility’ (2004) emphasises the

need for collective security and for security to

be addressed at the global, regional and

national level. The report identifies six

clusters of threats:

###### 

_Economic and social threats, including_

_poverty, infectious disease and environmental_

_degradation._

__

_Inter-State conflict._

__

_Internal conflict, including civil war,_

_genocide and other large-scale atrocities._


###### 12


-----

_Chemical, Biological, Radiological and_

_Nuclear (CBRN) weapons._

__

_Terrorism._

__

_International organised crime._

The European Security Strategy (ESS) was

adopted by the European Council in December

2003. The ESS identified that the EU faced

security threats “which are more diverse, less

visible and less predictable”. These threats

include:

###### 

_Terrorism – movements that are well_

_resourced, connected by electronic networks_

_and are willing to use unlimited violence to_

_cause massive casualties._

__

_Proliferation_ _of_ _Weapons_ _of_ _Mass_

_Destruction – potentially the greatest threat_

_to European security._

__

_Regional Conflicts – particularly those on_

_the borders of Europe._

__

_State Failure – an alarming phenomenon_

_that undermines global governance and adds_

_to regional instability._

__

_Organised Crime – cross-border trafficking_

_in drugs, women, illegal migrants and_

_weapons accounts for a large part of the_

_activities of criminal gangs._

In 2008, a report on the implementation of

the ESS was carried out by the EU’s then High

Representative. The report concluded that the


EU had made substantial progress over the

five year period and that the EU was

recognised as an important contributor to a

better world. Also, the report did indicate

that the world is changing fast, with evolving

threats e.g., cyber attacks, energy security,

climate change, piracy. However, despite all

that has been achieved, implementation of

the ESS remains work in progress and for the

EU’s full potential to be realised the EU needs

to be still _“more capable, more coherent and_

_more active”._

In the post Cold War environment the risk of

state vs. state conflict in the European context

is low. The United Nations and the European

Union, in assessing newer threats to global

and regional security, determine them to be

interconnected, more diverse, less visible and

less predictable involving state and non-state

actors. This presents a dynamic and

challenging defence and security

environment.

###### PEACE SUPPORT OPERATIONS.

A key element of Ireland’s contribution to

international peace and security is the

commitment of personnel to international

peace support operations (PSOs) under UN

authority. In responding to the demands

arising from the changed nature of peace

support missions, Defence Forces capabilities

have been enhanced to enable effective

participation in UN Chapter VII peace

enforcement missions.


###### 13


-----

New missions bring new challenges for the

Irish Peacekeeper. PSOs now have more

robust rules of engagement, while the

peacekeeper remains subject to Irish Law, the

Laws of Armed Conflict and International

Human Rights Law. Personnel are also

required to have an understanding of the

complex issues of cultural diversity affecting

both the host nation and troops from other

contributing nations. These challenges are

reflected in the training and preparation of

units prior to their deployment.

The development of bilateral relations has

been a key enabler for Ireland’s participation

in recent overseas operations where we have

participated in multinational or combined

units with other countries. Ireland’s

participation in CSDP and EU operations, in EU

Battlegroups and in NATOs Partnership for

Peace and the Partnership Goal process has

supported this process through the

development of increased interoperability

with other like-minded and EU member

States. The MINURCAT mission to Chad is an

example of this development, where troops

from the Finnish Armed Forces served

alongside Irish Defence Forces personnel.

Also, both Finland and Ireland participated in

the Nordic Battlegroup 2011 alongside

Sweden, Estonia and Norway. In June 2011,

440 members of the Defence Forces were

deployed on peacekeeping duties with the

UNIFIL mission in Lebanon. It is planned that

Finland will once again deploy to Lebanon, in

2012 and work alongside Irish Defence Forces

personnel.


The economic downturn and its associated

impact on the public finances has required

firm and decisive action by Government. The

Programme for Government sets out the

objective of reaching the 3% of GDP target for

the General Government Deficit by the target

date of 2015. Achieving the 3% of GDP deficit

target will be seen as an intermediate step in

the process of restoring the public finances,

and further reductions in the General

Government Deficit as a share of national

income will be required thereafter. This will

require a flexible and adaptive approach from

all public organisations including

transformation in the delivery of public

services.

The report of the Special Group on Public

Sector Numbers and Expenditure Programmes

(July 2009) clearly highlights the fact that the

Defence Organisation was unique in the public

sector, having reduced in size over the period

from 2001. In their report, the Group

acknowledged the ongoing reform in the

Defence Organisation. That report

recommended a further reduction in numbers

of 20 Departmental staff and 500 Permanent

Defence Force personnel, over a period of two

to three years. This recommended reduction

has already been achieved.

The Public Service Agreement 2010 – 2014

(Croke Park Agreement) contains elements

relevant to both the civil and military

elements of the Defence Organisation. It


###### ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.

-----

acknowledges the major process of change,

modernisation and transformation which has

been underway in the Defence Organisation

since the 1990s. The associated Defence

Sector Agreement is designed to ensure that

the Defence Forces remains fit for purpose

and will be able to continue to fulfil all of its

functions. Action Plans under the Agreement

are in place for both the civil and military

element of the organisation and the ambitious

targets in these plans are being met.

The Department of Defence will continue to

cooperate fully with central initiatives under

the Public Service reform agenda in the area

of shared services. The Department currently

provides financial shared services to the

Defence sector and has a long experience and

an excellent track record in the provision of

such services. The Department is participating

in a study group, led by the Department of

Public Expenditure and Reform.

######  ORGANISATIONAL ANALYSIS

A major process of change, modernisation and

transformation has been ongoing within the

Defence Organisation since the 1990s. This

process was continued through the White

Paper on Defence (2000) and successive social

partnership agreements. The organisation has

delivered a significant reduction in the

numbers of civil servants, military personnel

and civilian employees over this period. The

rationalisation of military installations has

continued. This modernisation programme

within Defence has led to improved


operational outputs. In respect of the Army, it

has been able to deploy, sustain and maintain

concurrent forces on the most demanding of

Peace Support Operations in the most austere

environments. The Naval Service patrol day

outputs have increased significantly after the

Naval Service Reorganisation. The Air Corps

contribution to the provision of services in

ATCP and ATCA has also increased.

Arising from the 2011 Comprehensive Review

of Expenditure, the Government decided to

maintain the strength of the Permanent

Defence Force at 9,500. This is to ensure that

the Defence Forces retain the capacity to fulfil

all roles assigned to the greatest extent

possible.

In response to the revised strength ceiling of

9,500, there will be a major re-organisation of

the Defence Forces encompassing a reduction

in the number of Army Brigades from three to

two.

The Defence Organisation has consistently

displayed many strengths. These include:

###### 

_Continued_ _capacity_ _for_ _change_ _and_

_flexibility as illustrated by the success of the_

_organisational reform process set out in the_

_White_ _Paper_ _and_ _the_ _Public_ _Service_

_Modernisation Agenda and the diverse ranges_

_of roles that are fulfilled._

__

_Proven_ _record_ _in_ _fully_ _meeting_

_Government’s national and international_

_security-related commitments._


###### 15


-----

_The provision of essential_ _domestic_

_supports at times when regular service_

_providers were unavailable._

__

_An_ _international_ _reputation_ _and_

_acceptance of the Defence Forces as a_

_professional force capable of delivering an_

_effective response across a broad spectrum of_

_peace support operations. The Defence Forces_

_are widely regarded as partners of choice in_

_international peace support operations._

Key challenges facing the Defence

Organisation include:

###### 

_The overarching challenge will be to_

_continue to sustain the delivery of military_

_capabilities and operational outputs within a_

_reduced resource allocation. The process of_

_organisational change in order to maximise_

_efficiency and effectiveness, including the_

_implementation of the Croke Park Agreement_

_will contribute in this regard. Within the_

_reduced resource envelope prioritising of_

_equipment procurement and infrastructural_

_development will be required in seeking to_

_meet capability and operational imperatives._

__

_The defence and security environment will_

_continue to evolve as will the requirements of_

_customers. The challenge will be to respond_

_effectively._

__

_Ensuring that our own people, civil and_

_military, through whom all defence services_


_are delivered, have the requisite skills to_

_perform their duties efficiently and effectively._

__

_Maximising the usage of electronic_

_systems to support business functionality._

__

_Managing the impact of the non-_

_decentralised_ _military_ _elements_ _of_ _the_

_Department of Defence as a result of the_

_deferral of the Curragh building project._

This Strategy Statement identifies the key

strategies and actions required to address

these challenges and, in so doing, continues

the work of implementing the White Paper on

Defence and addresses the commitments in

the Programme for Government 2011-2016,

the National Recovery Plan, the EU/IMF

Programme, the Medium-Term Fiscal

Statement, the Infrastructural and Capital

Investment Plan 2012-16: Medium Term

Exchequer Framework, the Public Sector

Reform Programme and the Public Service

Agreement 2010-2014 (Croke Park

Agreement).

This Strategy Statement also reflects recent

decisions taken in the context of the 2011

Comprehensive Review of Expenditure.

The High Level Goal of the Defence

Organisation is:

_To provide for the military defence of the_

_State, contribute to national and international_

_peace and security and fulfil all other roles_

_assigned by Government._

Achieving this high level goal entails distinct

but complementary strategic dimensions.

These are as follows:

1. Defence Policy

2. Ensuring the Capacity to Deliver

3. Defence Forces Operational Outputs

###### DEFENCE POLICY

The White Paper on Defence (2000) has

provided the policy framework for Defence for

the past decade. The defence and security

environment has changed appreciably over

this period, particularly in the international

domain, and this has required a flexible and

responsive approach from the Defence

Organisation. A key requirement of the policy

function is to ensure that appropriate policy

responses are formulated in response to

changes in the defence and security

environment. Defence policy, including policy

responses to changes in the defence and

security environment, is informed by military

advice.


The defence policy framework encompasses

the domestic sphere and includes, inter alia,

the work of the Office of Emergency Planning

and the development of Memoranda of

Understanding and Service Level Agreements

with other Government Departments and

State Agencies across a diverse range of roles.

There is ongoing collaboration with other

Government Departments and Agencies in

this regard.

The defence policy framework also includes, in

collaboration with the Department of Foreign

Affairs and Trade, Defence policy inputs to

global and regional defence and security

policy including the ongoing development of

the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy

(See Appendix 2 for further information).

The preparation of a new White Paper on

Defence, to provide an updated policy

framework for the period ahead, is the key

strategy that will be completed within the first

phase of the Strategy Statement. The process

will include the development and publication

of a Green Paper in order to initiate a broad

consultation process.

The Government’s Jobs Initiative includes

targeted measures to foster and grow

confidence in the Irish economy. The

Department of Defence and the Defence

Forces will contribute to Ireland’s economic

recovery. In the area of innovation, research


###### 17


-----

and development, business start ups there is

the potential for companies to collaborate

with the Defence Organisation. The links

which exist between the Defence Forces and

small companies in developing innovative

products, has the potential to contribute to

employment creation in the future, which can

contribute to our export growth. The Defence

Organisation will engage with Enterprise

Ireland and industry to examine the further

potential that can be gained from maximising

the Organisation’s contribution to supporting

business development.

The key strategies to be pursued are:

###### 

_A continuous review of the defence and_

_security environment to ensure the provision_

_of timely and relevant policy and military_

_advice to the Minister and to Government,_

_including advice in respect of international_

_security,_ _peace_ _support_ _and_ _defence_

###### ENSURING THE CAPACITY TO DELIVER

Defence policy determines and informs the

development of military capabilities. There are

five essential pillars to military capability:

operational viability, sustainability, readiness,

interoperability and deployability. This is

further explained in Appendix 3.


There are a broad range of inputs to the

capability development process. The

procurement of military equipment, the

maintenance of infrastructure and ongoing

development of regulatory and governance

structures are tasks which entail both civil and

military inputs. There are also capability

development activities that fall exclusively in

the military domain such as the training and

education of military personnel. Personnel

are the key component of military capability.

The ability to sustain operations is a key

element of military capability and equally

applies to domestic security and

contingencies. It requires sufficient depth of

personnel, equipment, etc to rotate as

required.

This strategic dimension is a key factor in

ensuring that Defence outputs are fit for

purpose and maintained at an appropriate

state of “readiness” for operational

requirements.

An appropriate force structure is a critical

element of military capability. In response to

the Government’s decision to maintain the

strength of the Permanent Defence Force at

9,500 personnel, a major re-organisation of

the Defence Forces has been initiated. The

Chief of Staff and the Secretary General will

bring forward detailed proposals for

consideration by the Minister for Defence.

The key strategies to be pursued in this area

are:


###### 19


-----

_Ongoing reform and modernisation of the_

_Defence_ _Organisation,_ _including_ _re-_

_organisation of the Defence Forces._

__

_Maintenance of conventional, all arms_

_military capabilities at targeted readiness_

_states to meet contingent and ongoing_

_operational requirements._

__

_Further_ _development_ _of_ _Special_

_Operations_ _Capabilities;_ _continued_

_development_ _of_ _Chemical,_ _Biological,_

_Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) capabilities;_

_further development of expert knowledge and_

_understanding_ _of_ _Counter_ _Improvised_

_Explosive Device (C-IED) measures; further_

_development of Defence Forces intelligence_

_function; progress the development of the_

_ISTAR capability; and the continued renewal_

_of doctrine under the auspices of the Defence_

_Forces Doctrinal Committee._

__

_Enhance and build on progress already_

_made in the area of joint operations between_

_the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service_

_through inter-service training and exercises_

_and improved coordination and integration at_

_the command, operational and tactical levels._

__

_Maintain appropriate Reserve Defence_

_Force capabilities._

__

_Continue to engage positively, in the_

_framework_ _of_ _CSDP,_ _in_ _the_ _ongoing_

_development of military and civil crisis_

_management capabilities, including EDA_

_capability development initiatives._

__


_Continue our positive engagement with_

_NATO/PfP, in the Partnership Goal process_

_and with PARP in order to enhance Defence_

_Forces_ _interoperability_ _in_ _multi-national_

_operations_ _and_ _to_ _contribute_ _to_ _the_

_development_ _of_ _military_ _capabilities_ _in_

_accordance with international standards._

__

_Continue_ _to_ _promote,_ _develop_ _and_

_maintain Civil Defence as an effective_

_volunteer_ _based_ _organisation_ _providing_

_emergency response and community support_

_services._

__

_Implementation_ _of_ _transformational_

_agenda across the Defence Organisation._

__

_Ensure that the Defence Organisation_

_develops and implements best practice_

_human_ _resources,_ _governance_ _and_

_management frameworks. (This is considered_

_in_ _detail_ _in_ _the_ _following_ _section,_

_Organisational Development)._

###### DEFENCE FORCES OPERATIONAL OUTPUTS

Military capabilities are used in operations

across the diverse roles assigned to the

Defence Forces. The outputs for these roles

are delivered by the Defence Forces and are

drawn from a fixed pool of resources. The

sustainability of operations requires a

sufficient pool of capabilities in order to rotate

personnel and replace equipment e.g. for

overseas operations.


###### 20


-----

In contrast to many other nations, the Irish

Defence Forces provide a variety of

operational outputs, on a day to day basis,

across a wide spectrum. This maximises the

utility of defence capabilities. While internal

security is primarily a matter for An Garda

Síochána, the Permanent Defence Force is

called upon to provide ongoing assistance in

the provision of armed security, EOD and air

and maritime support. The Defence Forces

also provide a variety of supports to the civil

authorities. Typical outputs include Fishery

Protection Patrols, Air Ambulance flights,

Ministerial Air Transport Services and

Ceremonial Services. In addition, it includes

providing assistance in the maintenance of

essential services.

A key element of Ireland’s contribution to

international peace and security is the

commitment of personnel to international

peace support operations (PSOs) under UN

authority. Ireland is committed to provide up

to 850 personnel under the United Nations

Standby System (UNSAS). From within this

figure, Ireland has committed a palette of

forces under the Helsinki Headline Goal which

requires the maintenance of a broad range of

capabilities at varying readiness states. Ireland

participated in the Nordic Battlegroup in 2011,

and is committed to participation in the

Austrian/German Battlegroup, which will be

on stand-by for the second six months of

2012.


Ireland’s commitment to participate in any

Battlegroup does not involve any commitment

on the part of Ireland to participate in any

specific Battlegroup operation. Participation

by Ireland in a specific Battlegroup operation

is subject to our national sovereign decision
making procedures - this means the “Triple

Lock” of a UN Mandate and Government and

Dáil approval, as appropriate, in accordance

with the Defence Acts.

The Key Strategies to be pursued are:


_Deploy Defence Forces capabilities to_

_approved Aid to the Civil Power operations._

__

_Deploy Defence Forces capabilities to_

_approved_ _Aid_ _to_ _the_ _Civil_ _Authority_

_operations._

__

_Conduct operations in accordance with_

_MOU/SLA targets._

__

_Deploy Defence Forces capabilities to_

_overseas_ _peace_ _support_ _missions_ _in_

_accordance with Government requirements._

__

_Provide personnel to support Security_

_Sector_ _Reform_ _and_ _capacity_ _building_

_initiatives, where requested and appropriate._


###### 21


-----

As previously outlined, the achievement of

our High-Level Goal requires the development

and maintenance of a broad range of

capabilities within the Defence Organisation.

A key challenge over the period of this

Strategy Statement will be to maintain service

provision and capabilities within a reduced

resource envelope. This will require a flexible

and adaptive approach and continued

organisational change.

Arising from the successful modernisation

agenda that has been pursued in the Defence

Organisation, a culture of change and

continuous improvement is now firmly

embedded. Business process reviews coupled

with value for money (VFM) reviews and

action plans under successive pay agreements,

have ensured that the Defence Organisation

continually delivers enhanced value for

money. Improved procedures for expenditure

planning, procurement and general

governance have also been implemented.

Defence is recognised as a model of successful

public sector reform.

We will place the Public Service Reform Plan

at the core of our work on Organisational

Development. A high-level Integrated Reform

Delivery Plan for the Defence Sector has been

prepared. This Plan will assist the Organisation

to manage the delivery of Public Service

Reform at the strategic level.


We will continue, in line with the provisions of

the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014 (the

Croke Park Agreement), to innovate and

transform defence structures, systems and

processes so as to maintain capabilities and

services in line with the provisions of the

Croke Park Agreement.

###### THE HUMAN RESOURCES STRATEGY.

The Defence Organisation will work to create

a supportive and positive culture that permits

all members to contribute to the organisation

to the best of their ability with all human

resource policies being informed by and

aligned with current best practice in the

workplace.

The objective of Defence Forces Human

Resource Strategy will be to enhance the

military capabilities of the Force, on land, at

sea and in the air through the timely provision

of appropriately qualified and highly

motivated individuals to all areas of the

organisation. In that context, best practice

Human Resource Strategies will be

implemented across the Force in the areas of

recruitment, selection, continuous

development, retention, exit and career

management. Defence Forces HR policy in the

area of Primary Care initiatives will be

explored and implemented as appropriate.

The Human Resources Strategy for civil service

staff of the Department will be reviewed in


###### 22


-----

line with ongoing developments in the public

sector, including the implementation of the

Public Service Agreement 2010-2014. The

Strategy will support the organisation’s high

level goal and will address issues that emerge

from the changing staffing profile of the

Department post-decentralisation. We will

continue to implement robust and effective

performance management through PMDS to

ensure delivery of organisational objectives

and to ensure that staff are supported to carry

out their roles.

There will be a continued focus on making

effective use of the contribution of the civilian

employee workforce to ensure that the

Defence Forces derive maximum benefit from

this valuable resource.

###### REVIEW OF MEDICAL SERVICES

The PA consultants report on the Medical

Services of the Defence Forces (2009),

assessed the current arrangements for the

provision of medical services in the Defence

Forces and proposed a model for future

delivery of those services. In accordance with

the commitment made in the Programme for

Government 2011-2016, we will implement

the Defence Forces Medical Services Review

as resources allow.

###### EQUIPMENT PLAN.

One of the major objectives of the White

Paper on Defence (2000) was the re-equipping

of the Defence Forces from what was


objectively identified as an extremely low

base. This has allowed for the development of

the Defence Forces capabilities required to

fulfil all roles assigned by Government and

meet changing demands. The High Level

Planning and Procurement Group (HLPPG) will

continue to utilise the multi-annual

equipment plan to prioritise requirements in

order to maintain the capabilities required,

having regard to reduced resources.

###### TRAINING &DEVELOPMENT.

The Defence Organisation will continue to

invest in its people. It will seek to develop

initiatives to identify training and

development opportunities that enable

participation from both the civil and military

sides of the Defence Organisation, leading to

enhanced cooperation in this area. The

Organisation will continue to review training

and development policy and implementation

with a view to ensuring effective use of all

resources available.

The Defence Forces will continue to prioritise

the training of its personnel in order to

maintain essential capabilities needed to face

future challenges. Such training must be

robust and challenging for both individuals

and units. Success in this important area will

permit the Defence Forces to develop the

necessary capabilities required to ensure

success in future robust Peace Support

Operations. It will also ensure that the

flexibility exists to complete contingent and

domestic tasks as they arise.


###### 23


-----

Building on the progress made to date, the

Defence Organisation will continue to invest

time and resources in partnership. There are

partnership structures in place involving the

Department’s civil service staff and civilian

employees, and the Defence Forces. Benefits

of the process include a greater shared

understanding of the business of defence and

how that can be progressed, better internal

and external communications, the

development of customer service planning

and implementation, better environmental

planning, and the creation of fora in which

issues of concern can be resolved.

The Defence Forces Conciliation and

Arbitration (C&A) Scheme provides a range of

fora for defence management to discuss with

the Defence Forces representative

associations, within the scope of

representation, the impact of the

implementation of our strategic objectives,

including implementation of the White Paper,

elements of which are incorporated in the

context of the Public Service Agreement 2010
2014, and the associated Defence Sector

Agreement. This will further enhance our

ongoing modernisation agenda. We will

enhance internal communications processes

and ensure transparency in the C&A process,

increasing access to current agreements and

understandings for all stakeholders.

###### EQUALITY ISSUES.


The Defence Organisation is committed to the

implementation of the codes of practice on

accessibility and the employment of people

with disability in the public service.

The Department will continue to meet or

exceed the Government 3% target for the

recruitment and employment of people with

disabilities and to provide training and

development appropriate to the needs of all

staff including those with a disability.  It

should be noted that the Defence Forces are

excluded from Part 3 of the Disability Act,

2005. The Department's role in relation to

Part 3 of the Act relates to the civilian

employees employed by the Department on

behalf of the Defence Forces and to the civil

staff of the Department together with the

staff of the Civil Defence Board, Office of the

Ombudsman for the Defence Forces, and the

Army Pensions Board.

As outlined in this Strategy Statement the

Defence Organisation is committed to

implementing best practice Human Resource

strategies and policies. This will support us in

maintaining an environment that guards

against age and gender related discrimination

in the workplace.

The Defence Organisation will continue to

develop and promote positive work relations

and a secure and supportive working

environment for all members of the

Organisation by the introduction of initiatives


###### 24


-----

aimed at enhancing diversity awareness by

further building personnel support initiatives.

In respect of the implementation of UNSCR

1325, the Defence Organisation will

implement as appropriate the

recommendations that are applicable in the

defence and security arena.

###### DECENTRALISATION.

The initial decision on decentralisation

provided for two new Department of Defence

buildings, one in the Curragh and one in

Newbridge. In light of budgetary constraints,

the Curragh building project was deferred.

Decentralisation to Newbridge proceeded as

planned. All civil service elements and a

number of military elements of the

Department of Defence are now

decentralised. The deferral of the Curragh

building has resulted in remaining military

elements of the Department of Defence being

dispersed over a number of locations. We will

continue to improve our systems and business

processes in the light of the recent

decentralisation to Newbridge and the

challenge presented by the deferral of the

Curragh building. We will continue to work

with the Office of Public Works to secure

appropriate accommodation in Dublin.

###### INFRASTRUCTURE

The Defence Organisation will continue to

provide the Minister with the best policy

advice and support in relation to the


management of Defence property and

infrastructure portfolio with particular regard

to the provision of an appropriate level of

property holdings to support the

accommodation, training and operational

requirements of the Defence Forces.

The modernisation process in Defence

identified that the dispersal of personnel over

an extended number of locations is a major

impediment to essential collective training

and imposes increased and unnecessary

overheads on the Defence Forces in terms of

barrack management, administration,

maintenance and security. The consolidation

process is designed to facilitate higher training

standards, while also freeing up personnel for

operational duties. The policy adopted by

Government of reinvestment of the proceeds

of property sales (including barrack closures),

has allowed for a progressive development of

defence assets from what was objectively

identified as an extremely low base level.

In line with Government policy and the

National Heritage Plan and National

Biodiversity Plan, the Department of Defence

and the Defence Forces are committed to

employing best practice to ensure the

protection of Ireland’s natural environment

and heritage resources. Our main focus on

environmental issues is concentrated on the

conservation of defence lands, pollution

prevention, energy conservation, recycling

and waste disposal, and environmental

enhancement generally. The preservation,

protection and restoration of natural


###### 25


-----

resources while fulfilling Defence training and

operational requirements are key issues.

We will support Government policy in

implementing energy-efficient and

environmentally-friendly initiatives

throughout the Defence Organisation and will

take the opportunity afforded by the provision

of the new building under decentralisation to

further implement these initiatives.

###### VALUE FOR MONEY (VFM)AND POLICY REVIEWS.

The Defence Organisation is fully committed

to ensuring value for money in defence

expenditure. The trend in expenditure on

Defence and associated outputs demonstrates

the delivery of value for money. The approach

we have taken is to continuously monitor the

defence and security environment to ensure

the continued relevance of White Paper

objectives.

A key goal of the White Paper was to ensure

that the State has modern and sustainable

Defence Forces with the capacity and

flexibility to undertake all roles assigned by

Government. The focus has been on ensuring

a fit for purpose Defence Organisation, which

maximises value for money. The challenge in

the years ahead will be to sustain

organisational capabilities within a reduced

resource envelope.

###### CUSTOMER SERVICE.


Given the nature of the activities we are

engaged in, the Defence Organisation does

not provide services to external ‘customers’ in

the classic sense. For example, there are no

public offices, public counters or call-centres

where the individual citizen can request

services on demand. Indeed, services are

typically provided to the community

collectively rather than to citizens as

individuals. In delivering these services the

Department of Defence and the Defence

Forces interact with Government

Departments, State Agencies and

International Organisations in defining service

delivery targets. Memoranda of

Understanding and Service Level Agreements

are mechanisms that are used to define and

monitor service delivery at this level.

In addition to the delivery of a range of

Defence Services on behalf of the citizens of

the State, the Department and the Defence

Forces also interact with a smaller pool of

organisations and individual customers on a

range of issues relating to the management

and delivery of Defence services. Direct

service provision to individual members of the

community takes the form mainly of

payments to pensioners and to suppliers of

goods and services, to assisting those who

want to supply goods or services to the

Department or the Defence Forces, and in

supporting recruitment to the Defence Forces.

The Defence Organisation is committed to the

provision of a high standard of quality


###### 26


-----

customer service to Government and to those

individuals and organisations with whom we

interact. The Department of Defence and the

Defence Forces Customer Charter and

Customer Service Action Plan for the period

2010-2012 sets out the service standards to

be achieved in that period. The Defence

Organisation will evaluate our performance

against the commitments in our Customer

Charter and use feedback received to improve

on service delivery. A report on performance

will be included in the Department of Defence

and Defence Forces Annual Report. The

results of the measurement of performance

will form the basis for the preparation of a

new Charter commencing in 2013.

###### OFFICIAL LANGUAGES ACT,2003.

In accordance with the Act, separate schemes

are published for both the civil and military

elements of the Defence Organisation.

Progress on the implementation of the

schemes is monitored by Oifig an

Choimisinéara Teanga.

The Department’s second scheme under the

Act encompasses the period 2010-2013. The

Department will prepare a further scheme

within the timeframe of this Strategy

Statement.

The Defence Forces Language Scheme for

2010-2013 was completed in December 2010

and approved by the Minister for Community,

Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs. The Defence

Forces continued to make progress in the

promotion of the Irish Language within the


organisation by implementing the

undertakings of the Language Scheme,

monitoring compliance with the provisions of

the Defence Forces Official Languages Policy,

the ongoing education of personnel in the

Irish language and the Irish language training

of participants in the annual Campa Gaeilge.

All matters pertaining to the Irish language are

organised, supervised and monitored by An

Chomhairle Gaeilge on behalf of the Chief of

Staff. All necessary steps will be taken to

maintain this progress during the lifetime of

this Strategy Statement.

###### FINANCE SERVICES.

The Finance Branch of the Department, which

is located in Galway, is the financial shared

service centre for the Department, the

Defence Forces, the Civil Defence Board, the

Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence

Forces and the Army Pensions Board. The

Branch will act as a proactive business partner

to management and business units and will

continue to provide financial services and

oversee policy on accounting and financial

management and deliver timely and accurate

management information.

The emphasis will continue to be on the

provision of effective and efficient service to

all internal and external customers, including

the preparation of payrolls for all employees,

both military and civil. The granting and

payment of pensions and gratuities to retired

members of the Defence Forces and the

dependants of deceased personnel will

continue, as will the formulation and


###### 27


-----

development of pensions policy. The payment

of all accounts for goods and services

provided to the Defence Forces and the

Department, maintaining financial records,

preparing the Department’s annual

Appropriation Accounts and supporting the

Management Information Framework (MIF)

will remain a priority. The maintenance of

service levels across all areas with reducing

staff numbers due to the moratorium on

public sector recruitment, will continue to

represent a significant challenge.

###### MANAGEMENT INFORMATION FRAMEWORK (MIF). 

The Management Information Framework

project supports policy analysis and

formulation through financial and asset

management, reporting, management

information and improved business processes

and procedures. An upgrade to a later version

of the Oracle eBusiness suite will be

implemented during the lifetime of this

Strategy Statement.

The MIF project has progressed beyond the

originally-defined project implementation into

a developmental and enhancement phase. A

comprehensive range of standard and

customised reports has been delivered to

date, in addition to business intelligence

capabilities. Further developments are

planned in the areas of costing and output

analysis with a view to enhancing

performance management and evidence
based decision making.  INTERNAL AUDIT.


The Department’s Internal Audit Section is an

independent unit reporting directly to the

Secretary General. The Section works to an

annual programme of audits, approved by the

Secretary General. Its work is reviewed on an

ongoing basis by the Department’s Audit

Committee. The Section reviews the risk

assessment process which is an integral part

of the annual business planning cycle. Both

the Internal Audit Section and the Audit

Committee operate in accordance with the

standards outlined in the Report of the

Working Group on the Accountability of

Secretaries General and Accounting Officers,

2002, (the Mullarkey Report).

###### INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES (ICTS).

The joint civil/military IT Steering Committee,

oversees the development of hardware,

software, and security (of shared strategic

applications), and telecommunications policy

in support of the work of the Department of

Defence and the Defence Forces. Within the

resources available, we will seek to maximise

the contribution of ICT to our work.

We will focus also on the strategic use of

technology and identifying opportunities to

deploy technology that will maximise value for

money from investment in terms of increased

productivity, greater efficiency and

effectiveness.


###### 28


-----

Due to the nature of our business the Defence

Organisation has limited direct contact with

the general public, consequently there is a

limited scope for the provision of on-line

services. However, the utilisation of e
recruitment for the Defence Forces

demonstrates how ICTs can be used to good

effect in establishing linkages with the general

public. We are committed to the goals and

approaches outlined in the eGovernment

strategy 2010 and will fully participate in all

central eGovernment initiatives as

appropriate.

**SHARED SERVICES**

The Programme for Government includes a

commitment to rationalise core processes

that are duplicated across the public service,

by establishing shared backoffice operations

for information technology, human resource

management, payments and entitlement

applications, business inspections and

procurement. This builds on the OECD Review

of the Public Service (2008) which suggested

that the Irish Public Service is on a sound path

to modernisation but identified a number of

areas for further development including

greater use of shared services. The

Department of Defence will proactively

engage in the implementation of shared

services arrangements.

###### REGULATORY REFORM. 

An appropriate and effective legislative and

regulatory framework is an important


facilitator for continuous improvement in the

delivery of defence services. The

Department’s programme of work underway

on the simplification and reform of both

primary and secondary legislation will

continue. As regards Regulatory Impact

Analysis (RIA), the Department of Defence is

not a regulatory authority as commonly

understood. The Defence Acts and

Regulations made thereunder are, for the

most part, focused on the Defence Forces only

and do not apply to the ordinary citizen or to

business. Notwithstanding this, the

Department applies the principles set out in

the RIA Guidelines where appropriate.

###### CIVIL DEFENCE

In line with the Government’s commitment to

bring the functions of many state agencies

back into their parent Department, the

Government has decided to transfer the

functions of the Civil Defence Board back into

the Department of Defence. The proposed

legislation will, if enacted, repeal the Civil

Defence Act, 2002, dissolve the Civil Defence

Board and transfer its functions, property,

rights, liabilities and other responsibilities

back to the Department of Defence.

###### DATA/STATISTICS STRATEGY.

Given the nature of its activities, the Defence

Organisation is not a significant producer of

data/statistics and does not have a significant

requirement for data/statistics from external

sources. Internal data needs tend to be


###### 29


-----

specific and focused. The improvement of

internal data systems and capabilities has

been the priority for the Department and

Defence Forces to date.  These systems and

capabilities will be enhanced with the planned

upgrades of the Department of Defence and

Defence Forces enterprise applications in the

period comprehended by this Strategy

Statement. Where relevant, internal data

sources that can be made available will be

classified and coded in line with Central

Statistics Office recommendations to enhance

standardisation and compatibility, facilitate

analysis, and ensure that the potential of such

data is harnessed.

###### CROSS-DEPARTMENTAL ISSUES.

There are important cross-departmental

dimensions to the work of the Defence

Organisation and mission success is often

critically dependent on the inputs and co
operation of other Departments and State

Agencies. Equally, the mission success of

other Departments and Agencies can be

dependent on the inputs and co-operation of

the Defence Organisation. Defence has

pioneered the use of Memoranda of

Understanding (MOUs) and Service Level

Agreements (SLAs) covering services delivered

to a range of customers in relation to sea

fishery protection, air ambulance, cash

escorts, GASU and services to other

Government Departments and agencies.

There are now defined and objective output

targets for the Defence Forces. We will

continue to develop this framework where

appropriate.


We will continue to work closely with the

Departments of An Taoiseach, Finance, and

Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to

the transformation of public services and the

implementation of the action plan under the

Croke Park Agreement on these matters and

in relation to defence modernisation and the

wider public service modernisation

The Finance Branch of the Department will

continue to participate in a number of cross
departmental payroll and financial

management user groups which address

common issues that arise from time to time.

We will assist the Department of the

Taoiseach in the introduction and

implementation of a new code of practice for

the use of the Government Jet.

We will continue to develop our relationship

with the Office of the Attorney General to

ensure that our work is completed within a

sound legal and constitutional framework. We

will further develop our positive relationship

Defence Forces.

We will continue to work closely with the

Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

regarding Ireland’s contribution to

international peace and security including our

relationship with the UN, EU, NATO, OSCE etc.

We will continue to support the work of the

Government Task Force on Emergency

Planning and the Office of Emergency


###### 30


-----

Planning (OEP) and where appropriate provide

assistance during emergencies to the principal

response agencies and participate in inter
agency structured exercises. The Task Force

will examine possible legislative approaches,

having regard to international best practice, to

support and improve the State’s response to

natural disasters.

Planning for the commemoration of the

Centenary of the Easter Rising, in 2016,


continues on a cross-Departmental basis. The

Defence Organisation has a key role to play

and is committed to working with others to

develop and implement a successful

commemorative programme. The military

service pensions (1916-1923) archives project

is being progressed. The Defence

Organisation will also continue to provide

assistance to State ceremonies such as the

National Day of Commemoration and the

National Famine Commemoration.


###### 31


-----

The Defence Organisation will implement this

Strategy Statement and continue to report on

progress annually to the Minister as required

under the Public Service Management Act

1997 and to publish those reports.

###### IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR STRATEGY.

We believe that our objectives, strategies and

performance indicators are results-focused

and specific so that implementation can be

more easily measured and corrective action

taken, if necessary. In many cases they are set

out in formal agreements with our customers

(e.g. MOUs and SLAs). Our objectives,

strategies and indicators are specified in

greater detail in the annual business planning

process, civil and military. Key aspects of this

include the preparation of annual business

plans, the ongoing monitoring and review of

progress, and regular reporting to the

Minister. The drafting of Annual Plans will

proceed against the background of the

ongoing assessment of the defence and

security environment as outlined above.

###### THE ANNUAL REPORT.

In accordance with the Public Service

Management Act, 1997, an Annual Report will

be submitted to the Minister, detailing

progress in achieving the Defence High Level

Goal. It will include a full review of the

Programme and where appropriate, furnish


detailed output data for both the Department

of Defence and the Defence Forces.

###### KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS.

Crucial to reporting progress is the

identification and monitoring of Key

Performance Indicators for the Defence

Organisation. They provide a verifiable

mechanism to analyse performance in the

achievement of the High Level Goal identified

in this Strategy Statement. The Key

Performance Indicators, Outputs and

associated Strategic Dimensions are listed

below.

Organisation has lead responsibility:


We will implement the Defence

Forces Medical Services Review as

resources allow. 

We will initiate a detailed legal

review of the basis, structures and

governance of the Red Cross in

Ireland to improve its functioning in

the light of changing circumstances.


The Defence Organisation will also fully

contribute to a broad range of cross-cutting

commitments provided for in the Programme

for Government.


-----

###### GLOBAL AND REGIONAL SECURITY

Defence outputs in support of global and

regional security, dovetail with our foreign

policy. The primacy of the United Nations

continues to be a cornerstone of that policy. A

commitment to collective security through the

development of international organisations

and regional co-operation is also a central

element of that policy.

###### THE UNITED NATIONS

For over 50 years Ireland has contributed

Defence Forces capabilities to United Nations

peace support operations. On 15 October

1998, Ireland signed a Memorandum of

Understanding with the United Nations in

relation to Defence Forces participation in the

United Nations Standby Arrangement System

(UNSAS). Under the UNSAS arrangement, the

State offers to provide up to 850 personnel on

overseas service at any given time.

Participation in UNSAS does not involve an

obligation to participate in any particular UN

mandated mission.

The New Horizon process was launched by the

United Nations (UN) in 2009, with the

publication of a document entitled “Charting a

New Horizon for United Nations

Peacekeeping”. The aim of the New Horizon


process is to assess the major policy and

strategy dilemmas facing UN Peacekeeping

today and over the coming years; and to

reinvigorate the ongoing dialogue with

stakeholders on possible solutions to better

calibrate UN Peacekeeping to meet current

and future requirements. In 2010, following

discussions with the relevant stakeholders and

partners, the UN endorsed four priority areas

from the document, covering Policy

Development; Capability Development; Field

Support Strategy; Planning and Oversight. The

UN will develop policy documents for each of

these areas and in this incremental way, the

main content of the New Horizon document

will be brought to fruition.

###### THE EUROPEAN UNION

 EUCOMMON SECURITY AND DEFENCE POLICY

The EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy

(CSDP) is an integral part of the EU’s Common

Foreign and Security Policy, which

encompasses the EU’s international

obligations to the maintenance of

international peace and security. The primary

function of CSDP is to provide the Union with

an operational capacity to undertake

peacekeeping, conflict prevention,

strengthening, international security and crisis


-----

management missions outside the territory of

the Member States.

In this regard, the EU is an influential actor

and adopts a comprehensive approach to the

maintenance of international peace and

security. The EU has at its disposal a wide

range of instruments it can deploy, which

include conflict prevention and crisis

management, to the longer term support for

development. Military capabilities are just one

element among this wide range of

instruments.

If the EU is to remain an active player in the

world, it must maintain highly capable military

forces - these are crucial to a credible CSDP.

With the increasing pressure on defence

budgets, there is a risk that Europe’s military

capabilities will be diminished. In this regard,

the EU has embarked on a new initiative in the

area of military capability development called

“Pooling and Sharing”. This initiative is seen

as a prudent approach to examining how vital

military capabilities, within reduced budgets,

can be retained, maintained and/or enhanced

by means of bilateral, regional and European
wide cooperation and ultimately made

available for CSDP operations.

Based on the provisions of the Treaty of

European Union, amended by the Lisbon

Treaty, Ireland continues to participate in the

ongoing development of EU military and

civilian crisis management capabilities under

CSDP. Participation in CSDP takes place within

the framework of Ireland’s commitment to the

primacy of the United Nations in the


maintenance of international peace and

security and Ireland’s traditional policy of

military neutrality.

The two main structures for the development

and implementation of CSDP are the Political

and Security Committee (PSC) and the EU

Military Committee (EUMC). These bodies are

supported by the European External Action

Service which incorporates the Crisis

Management and Planning Directorate and

the EU Military Staff respectively. Ireland is

represented at ambassadorial level in the PSC

and by a Brigadier General, representing the

Chief of Staff, within the EUMC. Defence

personnel, both civil and military, based in

Ireland’s Permanent Representation to the EU,

work proactively in furthering Ireland’s

national interests within the Union in

association with colleagues from the

Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

###### EUROPEAN DEFENCE AGENCY

Ireland has participated in the framework of

the European Defence Agency (EDA) since its

establishment in 2004. The EDA is headed by

the High Representative (HR) for the EU’s

Common Foreign and Security Policy. The

work of the Agency is achieved through a

Steering Board comprising EU Defence

Ministers of the participating Member States.

On a day-to-day basis, the Minister is

represented in the EDA by officials from his

Department. Departmental and Defence

Forces personnel also participate in the EDA’s

Integrated Development Teams (IDT), Project


-----

Teams (PT) and in the area of the Capability

Development Plan (CDP).

The EDA plays an important role in identifying

and overcoming shortfalls in defence

capabilities development. The EDA is also

focused on supporting the development of the

European Defence Technological and

Industrial base.

Ireland participates in the Code of Conduct on

Defence Procurement and the Electronic

Bulletin Board for Defence Contracts. Ireland

also participates in the Code of Best Practice

in the Supply Chain, which is designed to open

up Industry-to-Industry defence contracts.

Ireland continues to participate in the EDA’s

Research and Technology (R&T) Joint

Investment Project on Force Protection. The

force protection programme is a broad project

which aims to enhance the security of

deployed operations through improved

doctrine, best practice and emerging

technologies. Ireland’s key interest in the

programme is in the development of

technologies to protect troops from threats

such as snipers, booby traps and improvised

explosive devices (IED). Ireland also supports

the Agency’s work in capability development,

R&T and market initiatives within the

framework of CSDP and the relevant Treaty

provisions.

Since 2009, Ireland’s participation in specific

projects undertaken by the Agency is

considered on a case-by-case basis, and is

subject to Government and Dáil approval, in


accordance with the Defence (Miscellaneous

Provisions) Act 2009.

In 2011, the Government and Dáil Éireann

approved Ireland’s participation in two EDA

projects, one relating to Chemical, Biological,

Radiological and Nuclear protection and the

other to Maritime Surveillance. As approved

by Government, Enterprise Ireland will

promote and manage Irish Research and

Development participation in these two EDA

projects, in association with the Department

of Defence. In the case of Defence Forces

capability development opportunities, the

Defence Organisation, in association with

Enterprise Ireland, will now provide a valuable

and important link for Irish research and

industry to the leading edge capability

development efforts of the EDA.

On the 3rd October 2011, the Minister for

Defence launched a seminar on

“Opportunities in the European Security and

Defence Markets”, which was organised

jointly by Enterprise Ireland and the Defence

Organisation. The objective of the seminar

was to afford Irish industry and research

institutions an opportunity to engage with the

EDA, and to hear from the Defence Forces

about initiatives in their area of capability

development. Representatives from

academia, industry and the EDA, including the

Chief Executive of the Agency, attended the

seminar.


-----

The European Council at Helsinki in December

1999 established the EU Headline Goal, i.e. a

capability to deploy within 60 days, and to

sustain for at least one year, a Rapid Reaction

Force of up to 50-60,000 persons capable of

the full range of crisis management tasks

(Petersberg Tasks)[1]. The objective was to

achieve this Goal by 2003.

Ireland’s contribution to the Headline Goal

consists of an offer of up to 850 members of

the Defence Force, (which currently

represents more than 10% of our Army), from

within our existing commitment of 850

personnel to the United Nations Standby

Arrangements System (UNSAS).

In May 2004, during the Irish Presidency of the

EU, the Member States adopted a new overall

target - known as Headline Goal 2010. This

takes into account the European Security

Strategy, changes in the international

environment, including new threats and

1 _The "Petersberg tasks" are an integral part of_
_the Common Security and Defence Policy_
_(CSDP). They were explicitly included in the_
_Treaty on European Union (Article 17) and_
_cover: humanitarian and rescue tasks; peace-_
_keeping tasks; tasks of combat forces in crisis_
_management, including peacemaking. These_
_tasks were set out in the Petersberg_
_Declaration adopted at the Ministerial Council_
_of the Western European Union (WEU) in June_
_1992 and have been expanded under the_
_Lisbon Treaty. The list now includes tasks such_
_as joint disarmament operations (such as de-_
_mining); security sector reform (reforming_
_armies and police); military advice and_
_assistance tasks; humanitarian and rescue_
_tasks, etc._


challenges, as well as the lessons learned from

the first EU-led operations. The Military

Headline Goal 2010 (HLG2010) calls on EU

Member States to “be able by 2010 to respond

_with rapid and decisive action applying a fully_

_coherent approach to the whole spectrum of_

_crisis management operations covered by the_

_Treaty of the European Union”._

The EU agreed a political strategic document

on civilian and military capability development

which has extended the implementation of

the respective existing civilian and military

Headline Goals beyond 2010. It has issued

guidelines stating that efforts by the EU and

its Member States on capability development

beyond 2010 will focus on certain agreed

broad civilian and military capability

objectives.

###### BATTLEGROUPS

A key element of Headline Goal 2010 is the

capability to deploy forces at high readiness,

broadly based on the Battlegroups concept,

which would complement the Rapid Reaction

Force concept. As of January 2007, the EU has

achieved full operational capability, which

means that two Battlegroups are continually

on standby for a period of 6 months at a time.

Ireland participated in the Swedish-led Nordic

Battlegroup (NBG) which was on standby from

1 January 2011 to 30 June 2011. Ireland’s

contribution to NBG 2011 was an Intelligence

Surveillance Target Acquisition

Reconnaissance Group together with support


-----

elements and staff posts at NBG Force

Headquarter (FHQ) in Enkoping, Sweden.

Ireland has committed to participating in the

Austrian/German Battlegroup, which will be

on stand-by for the second six months of

2012. The proposed Defence Forces

contribution will be the same capability

commitment as was offered to the Nordic

Battlegroup 2011.

###### EU CO-OPERATION WITH

 INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS.

Co-operation between the EU and other

international actors, particularly the UN, in the

area of crisis management, has also developed

substantially into a diverse network of co
operation and interaction, spanning virtually

the entire range of EU external relations.

Ireland continues to encourage and promote

the ongoing development of EU-UN co
operation in the area of humanitarian action,

crisis management, peacekeeping and conflict

prevention, with a particular emphasis on EU

action in support of UN operations. In this

regard, the Department of Defence, in

association with the Department of Foreign

Affairs and Trade, has developed a Food For

Thought paper, “Enhancing EU/UN Co
operation”[2]. The paper highlights a number of

options as to how the EU, as part of its

ongoing CSDP capability development process,

might identify niche or modular capabilities

developed for CSDP crisis management

2 [Available on quick links at http://www.defence.ie](http://www.defence.ie/)


operations, which could be made available to

and fully integrated into UN-led “blue-hat”

crisis management operations. The EU’s Crisis

Management and Planning Directorate

(CMPD) are in the process of bringing forward

this initiative in consultation with the United

Nations.

The EU and NATO have continued to develop

their strategic partnership in crisis

management with co-operation in particular

where the two organisations operate in the

same theatre.

Beyond cooperation in the field, other key

priorities for cooperation are to ensure that

military capability development efforts are

mutually reinforcing, as well as combating

terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of

mass destruction.

###### NATOPARTNERSHIP FOR PEACE (PFP)

Ireland joined Partnership for Peace (PfP) on 1

December 1999. NATO has adopted a

multitude of formal military standards to

ensure seamless integration of multi-national

forces. These standards cover everything from

training, equipment and ammunition to

organisation, operational procedures and

administration. All western countries,

including neutrals, have adopted these

standards. NATO has, in effect, become the

ISO of the military world. PfP is the

mechanism which gives Ireland access to

NATO standards. Therefore our participation


-----

in PfP is essential in order to confirm our

interoperability with partners.

The essence of the PfP programme is a

partnership formed individually between each

Partner country and NATO, tailored to

individual needs and jointly implemented at

the level and pace chosen by each

participating government. Ireland’s

engagement in PfP is supported through

Ireland’s Partnership Liaison Office at NATO

Headquarters in Brussels.

Ireland’s 5 priority areas of interest are:


Co-operation on International

Peacekeeping; 

Humanitarian operations; 

Search and Rescue; 

Co-operation in the protection of the

Environment; and, 

Co-operation in Marine Matters.

Ireland’s annual Individual Partnership

Programmes (IPP) under NATO PfP focuses on

the enhancement of skills and expertise in

such areas as operational and generic

planning for peacekeeping and peace support

operations, communications, command and

control, operational procedures and logistics.

Activities include training courses, seminars,

workshops, conferences, staff exercises and

tabletop exercises. In 2010, Ireland’s tenth

annual Individual Partnership Programme

(IPP), covering the period 2010-2011, was

completed in consultation with the

Departments of Foreign Affairs; Environment,


Heritage and Local Government; Justice and

Law Reform; Health and Children; and

Communications, Energy and Natural

Resources.

Ireland, in common with other neutral EU

Member States who are members of PfP, also

participates in the PfP Planning and Review

Process (PARP) mechanism for planning in

relation to peace support operations. The

scope of Ireland’s involvement in PARP is

focused on enhancing interoperability so that

Defence Forces personnel can operate

efficiently and effectively in a multi-national

environment.


-----

A broad range of actions within the Defence

Organisation are required in the development

of appropriate military capabilities. These

actions include investment in new equipment

and infrastructure, military doctrine, HR

policies and regulatory reform. These efforts

are coordinated by enhanced senior

management structures such as the Strategic

Management Committee, High Level Planning

and Procurement Group, etc.

The Defence Capability Framework outlines

plans and associated activities relating to

capability development. These plans are

established for the various functions and force

packages and include training activity targets

for the Defence Forces. The five essential

components of military capabilities are met

through implementation of these plans. It is

important to note that this framework is a

work in progress and is continuously evolving

in terms of the changing security environment

and requirements of the Defence Forces.

Likewise, the outcomes of the process of

meeting the quantitative and qualitative

targets will feed back into strategic

considerations on an ongoing basis. MILITARY CAPABILITY

There are five essential pillars to military

capability: operational viability, sustainability,

readiness, interoperability and deployability.


a. _Operational_ _Viability_ is

concerned with ensuring that a

given force package can prevail

in an operational situation. It is

achieved through the synthesis

of personnel, equipment,

military doctrine, organisation,

training and command, control

and communications.

b. _Sustainability is concerned with_

ensuring that the capability

continues to be operationally

viable. It entails ensuring that a

given force package can maintain

a mission tasking, at the required

operational tempo, for the

duration required. Consequently

this pillar pertains to the

continued provision of trained

personnel and logistical and

maintenance support.

c. _Readiness_ is the immediate

ability of a given force package

to execute a designated mission

while balancing the constraints

of time and capability. It is a

combination of current levels of

personnel, training, equipment,

command, control,

communications and

intelligence. Readiness must be

underpinned by appropriate

doctrine and should be

continually shaped by lessons


-----

learned. In addition, readiness

levels are based on risk

assessments of the Defence and

Security environment and when

deemed necessary, selective

elements or the entire Force can

be brought to a higher readiness

level.

d. _Interoperability_ is concerned

with ensuring that the force

elements that constitute force

packages can operate “jointly”

and successfully with other force

elements or “combined” with

other military organisations or

civilian authorities. It entails

familiarity with other’s

operational procedures.

Consequently this requires

suitable equipment, personnel,

systems and infrastructure

programmes, policies and

procedures.

e. _Deployability is concerned with_

ensuring that a given force

package can deploy to a mission

area in a given time frame.

Essentially, it entails raising force

elements to deploy nationally

and/or internationally with the

required training, preparation

and equipment in place.

Figure 1 overleaf illustrates the Defence

Capability Framework and indicates the

various enablers currently in place that


facilitate the delivery of Defence Forces

Capability.
