##### FOREWORD


###### MINISTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY

The 2018-2023 Ministry of National Security Strategic Plan is anchored to the Vision 2030 National

Strategic Development Plan, towards the achievement of the goals as they relate to the security and

safety of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. In furtherance of Vision 2030’s Theme II: “Promoting

Good Governance and Service Excellence,” we, at the Ministry of National Security will work towards

the stated National Outcome to develop and implement a Modern and Effective Law Enforcement

System and Defence and Security sector. In so doing, we will enhance our capabilities to predict,

deter, detect and prosecute crime, criminality and any attack on our democracy, as well as improve

our systems for rehabilitation, and partner with key stakeholders in the pursuit of restorative justice.

The Ministry of National Security has primary responsibility for safety and security of the nation.

However, I believe that safety and security is ultimately the responsibility of each and every one of us

and as the Ministry adopts a ‘whole of Ministry’ and ‘whole of society’ approach, I urge my fellow

citizens to commit to a multi-dimensional holistic approach to our fight to effectively reduce crime and

criminality, and enhance the security of our population. Given the diversity and complexity of National

Security challenges in the 21st century, the Ministry must create sustainable long-term solutions that

can be grounded in the strengthening of our alliances within the Ministry, with civil society and with

our regional and international partners to protect the nation and to contribute to a stable Caribbean

region.

It has become apparent that gang violence accounts for the majority of serious violent crime in this

country, with firearms the preferred weapon of choice. Transnational organised crime, such as

trafficking in all its forms, youth violence, terrorism, and pervasive gang culture and associated gang

violence contribute to the increase in our country’s crime rate and murder toll nearly every day. The

security, safety and well-being of this country are the concerns of every citizen. In this regard, the

Ministry of National Security recognizes it has the responsibility to provide strong leadership and

therefore determined that its mission is “to advance national development by creating a safer and

more secure society through enhanced collaboration among all stakeholders, intelligence-based

decision-making and strengthened inter-agency structures and systems.”

The Ministry adopted a ‘whole of Ministry’ approach in the development of the Plan, through the

establishment of a cross-Divisional Strategic Planning, Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation

Team. The Team played a key role in the Plan’s development and will continue in an oversight and

reporting capacity for its implementation, monitoring and evaluation. This approach was designed to

ensure continuous tracking and assessment of the performance of the Ministry, towards achievement

of its goals and objectives. The passion and commitment demonstrated by staff and other


-----

_Updated: March 5[th], 2018_

stakeholders in the development of the plan speaks volumes for the desire to work assiduously towards

the achievement of the Ministry’s goals to ensure safer and more secure communities.

Our strategy sets out to integrate Government, civil society and our international partners to create

focused and innovative solutions to traditional and emerging national security issues and challenges.

Our endeavours will not be in vain; because I believe that National Security is not an elusive

accomplishment but an achievement possible with the help and vigilance of every citizen. As such,

we will facilitate the strengthening of an environment which ensures public safety and security through

the enforcement of the rule of law and maintenance of order, and the commitment of all available

resources to the protection of life and property.

In moving towards a sustainable path we are therefore repositioning our strategic direction to serve

our country better and achieve much greater levels of safety and security. We put forward a Plan for

the period 2018 – 2023 outlining our short, medium and long term goals, and include a detailed

twenty-four (24) month Operational Plan, given the realities of the current economic situation. This

Operational Plan will be reviewed prior to its expiration with a view to the proactive development of a

plan for a further two-year period.

As Minister of National Security, I am confident that through the continued commitment, cooperation

and collaboration with all our stakeholders, we will achieve our goal of improved safety and security

of our nation.

Major General (Ret’d) the Honourable Edmund Dillon

Minister of National Security

###### PERMANENT SECRETARIES – MINISTRY OF NATIONAL SECURITY

The Ministry of National Security, having primary responsibility for the maintenance of law and order,

public safety and security, co-ordination of disaster preparedness and emergency relief, and control

of the flow of people in and out of the country, has developed a Strategic Plan for the period 2018
2023 which outlines initiatives to support these goals. The Ministry is well poised to bring this plan to

fruition as it is comprised of a highly skilled, experienced and committed workforce.

The Ministry must ensure continued alignment with Government’s mandate articulated in the Vision

2030 National Strategic Development Plan. As a critical contributor to the Pillar: “Promoting Good

Governance and Service Excellence”, the Plan focuses on targeted areas as the Ministry’s strategic

imperatives to achieve the desired goals. In pursuit of the strategic imperatives outlined in the plan,

the Ministry intends to review and improve its structure and systems to create a more robust, efficient

and effective organization. This is set out under the strategic imperative “Governance” in the plan

which will pursue the Ministry’s policy and legislative agenda to support its mandate.

In the face of limited resources, the Ministry must strive to optimize those resources available to it by

improving efficiency. In accordance with this, “Stakeholder Partnership and Collaboration” is also a

critical imperative in the plan to harmonise working relationships and foster closer communication and

collaboration. The plan seeks to put the Ministry on this path as it sets out clear lines of responsibility

and accountability. The Ministry will strive to bring about the change necessary to cultivate an

environment where our citizenry feel a greater sense of safety and security.

We wish to recognize the efforts of the staff of the Ministry for their commitment and support in the

development of this plan. The engagement of key stakeholder Ministries and other agencies also

provided valuable information to aid the development process. It is our intention to maintain this

communication and collaboration as we move forward to the implementation and monitoring and

evaluation stage of the plan and towards the achievement of our stated objectives.

##### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


Determined to meet the evolving challenges and opportunities of a changing environment that includes

an expanded Ministry, the Ministry of National Security (MNS) undertook a transformational strategic

planning exercise. The process was aimed at improving the capacity and capability of the organisation

to drive superior service delivery to the citizenry of Trinidad and Tobago.

To this end, an MNS Strategic Leadership Session was held in July 2016. This session set the stage

and created the opportunity for revisiting the MNS’ strategic direction, and the development of a MNS

Strategic Plan for the period 2018-2023. Accordingly, the following recommendations were made:

 Establish a Strategic Planning, Implementation, Monitoring & Evaluation [SPIME] Team that

would have the responsibility for advancing the Strategic Planning process and ensuring

planning timelines were met

 Engage key stakeholders with a view to gathering and verifying data that is critical to the

strategic direction of the MNS

 Facilitate a process that would ensure a deeper and more rigorous analysis of conclusions

 Develop Strategic Imperatives, Objectives and Core Values

 Develop Operational Plans for each Strategic Imperative

The Strategic Plan was developed to ensure alignment with the Vision 2030 National Development

Strategy, particularly with respect to “Theme II - Promoting Good Governance and Service

Excellence” and “Theme V - Placing the Environment at the Centre of Socio-economic Development”.

Within Theme II, the National Performance Management Framework outlines the National Outcome

5 “A Modern and Effective Law Enforcement System” which states that “it is expected that a

modernized and effective law enforcement and policing system will create an environment which

ensures public safety through the maintenance of law and order.” This plan is designed to support

this outcome in its direct focus in the Strategic Imperative of “Crime Prevention and Reduction.”

Within Theme V, the National Performance Management Framework outlines National Outcome 4

which is “Increased Resilience of Climate Vulnerable Sectors”. The plan addresses this outcome in

the Strategic Imperative of “Hazard Resilience” under which Disaster Risk Management will be

pursued to improve the response to hazards and disasters.

_Updated: March 5[th], 2018_

The Ministry of National Security’s Strategic Plan 2018 - 2023 has been designed to enable the Ministry

to fulfill its mandate -- to ensure a safer Trinidad and Tobago. This 5-year plan will facilitate the

strengthening of an environment of public safety and security through enforcement of the rule of law

and maintenance of order. Additionally, the plan is crafted to promote strategic and innovative thinking

among MNS personnel and other key stakeholders. This approach is geared towards enabling the

Ministry to be more agile and responsive to mitigate current and emerging threats with up-to-date

technology and innovative strategies. The plan will also provide stakeholders with an in-depth analysis

of the Ministry’s contextual environment as it relates to capacity and capability.

The strategic formulation process was driven by extensive information gathering from primary and

secondary sources to assess the Ministry’s current state. Secondary sources included previous strategic

plans, reports, statistics and newspaper articles. These facilitated a clearer understanding of the

historical evolution of the Ministry and provided details on its present governance structure, processes,

policies and culture. To complete the current state assessment, extensive stakeholder sessions were

conducted. The engagement of both internal and external stakeholders produced an aggregation of

perspectives that allowed for a more holistic understanding of the capacity and capability of the

Ministry.

Through the work of a core planning team that comprised representatives of all Divisions of the

Ministry (SPIME - Strategic Planning Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation), the data was

analysed and categorised to identify major areas of priority - strategic imperatives. These strategic

imperatives represent the Ministry’s broad areas of focus from which strategic objectives, major

initiatives and supporting projects were developed.

The five (5) strategic imperatives listed below focus on developing and strengthening internal

competencies, while simultaneously enhancing the services that the Ministry provides to its

stakeholders.

**Crime Prevention and Reduction**

**Hazard Resilience**

**Governance**

**Stakeholder Collaboration and Partnership**

**Capacity and Capability Resourcing**

**and Optimization**

**Fig. 1: Ministry of National Security Strategic Imperatives 2018 - 2023**

_Updated: March 5[th], 2018_

Each strategic imperative is defined by a statement of intent that articulates the desired outcome of

the imperative. This built-in focus on outcomes would serve as a point of reference in evaluating the

success of the strategy when it is implemented. The implementation process will be guided by a

twenty-four (24) month operational plan.

Strategic imperatives were disaggregated into major initiatives, which were further broken down into

specific projects. Each project was then scheduled and assigned for execution using the RACI

Framework (a model that identifies the persons who are Responsible, Accountable, and those who

should be Consulted and Informed within each project).

Within the operational plan, an assessment of risk and possible mitigating activities was designed for

each project. This contingency plan approach is intended to trigger innovative problem-solving

activities within the MNS (culture change), and increase the prospects of successful implementation.

This Strategic Plan is holistic as it incorporates and aligns the activities and resources of the Ministry’s

nine divisions to enhance service delivery to all stakeholders. Through its implementation, it is

anticipated that the Ministry will become the hallmark of the “whole of Ministry” (a synergized efficient

Ministry) approach, a leading force in the “whole of Government” ambition, and a major enabler of

peace, prosperity and economic and social stability for all citizens of Trinidad and Tobago.

##### INTRODUCTION


The Ministry of National Security (MNS) is among the largest and most complex entities within the

public sector. It is the arm of the Government of Trinidad and Tobago with primary responsibility for

ensuring and maintaining the security and safety of the public, as well as the sovereignty and security

of the national space. The MNS is charged with an operational mandate that includes:

 Maintenance of Law and Order, Public Safety and Defence against Aggression

 Management of Disaster Preparedness and Relief

 Monitoring and Control of the flow of persons into and out of the country

To fulfill its functions, the Ministry is staffed with approximately 21,000 persons, which includes

military, paramilitary and civilian personnel, some of whom are on contract, while the majority is on

the establishment. These persons are assigned to primary Divisions listed hereunder:

**Key Agencies of the Ministry of National Security**

1. Trinidad and Tobago Defence Force

2. Trinidad and Tobago Police Service

3. Trinidad and Tobago Fire Service

4. Trinidad and Tobago Prison Service

5. Trinidad and Tobago Cadet Force

6. Immigration Division

7. Office of Disaster Preparedness and Management

8. Trinidad and Tobago Forensic Science Centre

9. Strategic Services Agency (specially-mandated Agency at the Divisional level)

10. General Administration

In addition to the Divisions listed above, there are several other ‘specifically-mandated’ Units/ Agencies

under the purview of the Ministry of National Security. These are as follows and also represented on

the organisation chart as Appendix 1:


-----

 - HIV & AIDS Coordinating Unit  - Record Management

 - Human Resource Management  - Registry

 - Information Technology  - Research

 - Internal Audit

 - International Affairs

**The Executive**

The responsibility for introducing policy, consistent with Government’s strategic priorities and

overseeing its implementation lies with the Minister of National Security, who is supported at the Head

Office by a Minister in the Ministry of National Security, a Parliamentary Secretary, two (2) Permanent

Secretaries, one of whom is the Accounting Officer for the Ministry, and three (3) Deputy Permanent

Secretaries. Collectively, they constitute the Executive Leadership Team of the Ministry.


-----

_Updated: March 5[th], 2018_

The Minister and his Leadership Team bear the responsibility for overseeing all matters relating to the

Ministry’s established mandate, which focuses primarily on the following:

  - Public Order: Safety and Law Enforcement

  - Protection of the Airspace and Territorial Waters

  - Intelligence

  - Immigration

  - Disaster Preparedness and Management

  - Social Programmes (which include the Citizen Security Programme and Specialized Youth

Service Programmes)

The Leadership Team is supported by and works closely with the Heads of the various

Divisions/Agencies of the Ministry to ensure fulfilment of the organisation’s mandate. The Heads are

charged with the day-to-day operations of their respective Divisions/Agencies and together with the

Leadership Team, form the Executive arm of the Ministry of National Security.

It was highlighted quite early in the diagnostic and conceptual discussions, that the MNS was

considered to be the sum of many parts and thus, there was a need to establish a clear Ministry

“identity”. This was opined as being critical to the development of the MNS Strategic Plan, which is to

be driven by a more “whole of Ministry” approach. It is believed that the MNS identity would inform

the development of policies and heighten the probability of strategic cohesion and participation

towards the improvement of service delivery.

The Ministry of National Security has nine (9) Divisions, each with its own sub-identity. A concerted

effort was made throughout the planning process to promote the benefits of synergy and resource

optimization, whilst taking into consideration their diverse responsibilities and approaches. Through

this plan, it is expected that a clearer Ministry identity would emerge - one that is supported by core

values that would govern how services are provided inter-divisionally, nationally, regionally and

internationally.

As illustrated above, the process that guided the development of the Strategic Plan involved the use

of the Odyssey Strategic Thinking Model[©] which anchored all activities undertaken. This model

employs a three-tiered approach to strategy formulation. Each level is then broken down into smaller

components which help to map and align the strategic building blocks. The model mandates that at

the first stage (Exploring Perspectives), a comprehensive assessment of “what is going on?” or the

Current State Assessment is done.

The key focus was on capturing data from different perspectives on the external and internal

environmental issues which affect and will continue to affect the MNS in fulfilling its mandate. It is in

this context that Odyssey and the SPIME team undertook to conduct extensive primary research

through internal and external stakeholder sessions and secondary research through key document

review. The primary data collected through the stakeholder sessions and interviews was guided by

the Odyssey Organisational Model[©] and the SW (Strengths and Weaknesses) of the SWOT Model. The

Odyssey Organisational Model[©] divides the organisation into four (4) major elements of analysis,

ensuring all aspects of the organisation are captured within the strategic analysis. These four elements

are:

1. The Vision element (where the Ministry is going and should be operating)

2. The Socio-cultural element (cultural identity of the organisation)

3. The Operational-functional element (systems/processes, capacity, capability)

4. The Human element (personal competencies, attitudes)

In the second stage of the Strategic Thinking Model (Discerning Significance), key levels of validation,

connection and distillation were done. Thereafter, through discussions, Odyssey and the SPIME team

tested the validity, accuracy and soundness of the data, placed the data in context and established

patterns, connections and themes, and ultimately clarified the potential impact and implications for

the MNS. The Discerning Significance stage was used to determine the Opportunities and Threats

(OT) for both the external (PESTILE analysis) and internal (SWOT) environment.

The identification and analysis of Opportunities and Threats (OT) provided the basis upon which the

third stage (Envisioning Possibilities) of the plan was developed. The team was able to distill the

strategic imperatives and strategic objectives by reviewing these opportunities and threats. The

process was further detailed to develop a 24-month plan with a RACI matrix and a Risk Mitigation

Framework, all designed to increase the probability of implementation success. The RACI matrix is a

tool used to track roles and responsibilities, and increase the probability of successful implementation.

###### DIAGNOSTICS

 The Data-Gathering Process

The diagnostic information was gathered by asking open-ended questions on the operating

environment of the Ministry to internal and key external stakeholders.

 **The External Environment**

The PESTILE model (a derivative of the PESTLE model, in which “industry-related” factors are

included) was used to gather external environmental information.

**Technological**

**Industry-**

**Socio-cultural**

**Sector**

**Economic** **Legal**

**MINISTRY OF**

**Political** **NATIONAL** **Ecological**

**SECURITY**

**Fig. 3: PESTILE Analysis**


-----

_Updated: March 5[th], 2018_

 **Internal Current State Assessment**

The SW (Strengths and Weaknesses) internal current state assessment is a derivative of the

SWOT analysis. Stakeholders were asked to clearly outline the strengths of the organisation,

and then define the weaknesses of the organisation as it pertains to structure, processes,

culture and its character.

The combination of these analyses facilitated an in-depth assessment of the current state of

the Ministry, and provided the basis upon which strategic possibilities could be explored.

To commence the diagnostic analysis of the Ministry, the Odyssey Organisational Model[©] was

used to frame the organisation. The four major organisational elements used ensured that all

aspects of the organisation were captured within the strategic analysis.

These elements were analysed within the context of the transactional environment within

which the Ministry conducts its operations, and further, the contextual environment, which is

the wider environment in which Ministry may have limited or no impact. The concepts are

illustrated in the diagram below:

**Fig. 4: Odyssey Organisational Model [©]**


-----

_Updated: March 5[th], 2018_

###### Diagnostic Structure and Process

The diagnostic process required a structure that enabled efficient and effective information gathering.

Focus groups and interviews provided key MNS stakeholders the opportunity to make valuable input

into the Strategic Plan. These groupings were as follows:

 **Ministry’s Executive Leadership Group**

This group consisted of the Minister and the Executive of the Ministry. Discussions generated

information on the strategic viewpoint of the Ministry and a working understanding of Cabinet’s

mandate with respect to National Security.

 **Heads of Divisions**

Meeting with the Executives of the various Divisions helped gather significant information

relative to uniqueness and peculiarities in the nature and operations of each. From a

comparative analysis of the feedback, clear trends emerged. These trends were taken into

consideration to develop a more cohesive Strategic Plan, as well as increase the probability of

seamless operations in the future.

 **Internal Stakeholder Groups**

The internal stakeholder groups comprised cross-sections of employees from each Division

with different designations, background disciplines and strata. These internal stakeholder

sessions used three methods of data gathering – observation, focus groups and interviews.

1. Observation of special MNS Staff Session

A special session of all MNS General Administration Staff generated valuable insights on

the challenges that needed to be addressed to improve the performance of the Ministry.

2. Focus groups

There were thirteen (13) focus group sessions, which were each attended by

approximately forty (40) persons. These meetings produced the bulk of critical information

and trends that formed the building blocks of the strategic formulation.

3. Interviews

Through this approach, Heads were interviewed to attain a deeper perspective of the

functionality of varying Sections/Units and Divisions within the Ministry. This data

collection method provided an avenue for deeper and more intimate understanding of the

various arms of the Ministry.


-----

_Updated: March 5[th], 2018_

 **Validation Groups**

The validation groups comprised an essential cross-section of all the intra-ministerial groups

from different strata and Divisions. These groups were charged with the responsibility to

critically assess the information gathered throughout the process. Feedback from these

sessions served as quality control for the information gathered.

 **External Stakeholder Groups**

Every entity has stakeholders that are upstream, downstream and associates. Capturing the

perspectives of these entities enabled a 360 degree assessment of the impact of the Ministry’s

operations, and afforded a deeper understanding of the perceived role of the MNS. The MNS

Stakeholder map revealed intricate links among key stakeholder entities. These included:

    - The Ministry of the Attorney General and Legal Affairs

    - The Judiciary of Trinidad and Tobago

    - Ministry of Foreign and CARICOM Affairs

    - Ministry of Finance

    - Ministry of Social Development and Family Services

    - Ministry of Community Development, Culture and the Arts

To complete the stakeholder assessments, interviews were conducted with external

stakeholders. The external stakeholders were asked to describe their understanding of the

role of the MNS and their assessment of the MNS’ performance in relation to this role. Following

the assessment, participants were asked to provide suggestions to improve the gaps they

highlighted. This information was recorded and used to shape an appropriate and relevant

strategy.

 **The SPIME Team**

The creation of a Strategic Planning Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation (SPIME) Team

was testimony to the cross-functional/cross-divisional approach adopted throughout this

process. The SPIME team was charged with leading the planning process, and will also

facilitate and monitor the implementation of the 24-month operational plan.

##### INTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT


The following are some of the major issues raised by internal stakeholders regarding the operations

of the Ministry of National Security.

**Sub-optimal planning**
**“Silo Effect”** **Poor Communication**

**and procurement**


**Poor Human Resource**
**Outdated processes**

**Planning**


**Governed by outdated**

**laws**


**Inadequate**

**Multi-Lingual staff**


**Knowledgeable and**

**Capable Workforce**


**Fig. 5: Internal Environmental Context**

 **“Silo Effect”**

The Ministry is comprised of nine (9) Divisions, all possessing their own resources, systems

and cultures. Stakeholders raised concerns about the Ministry’s seeming inability to maximize

the use of resources inclusive of funding, expertise, networks, manpower and equipment. The

negative impact of the silo effect was viewed as counter-productive, particularly within the

context of a contracting national economy.

 **Poor Communication**

Poor communication has become a growing concern within the Ministry. The size of the

Ministry, compounded by the silo effect, contributes to inefficient distribution of critical

information. In an attempt to address this issue, stakeholders suggested the implementation

of a “whole of Ministry” communication policy and structure.


-----

_Updated: March 5[th], 2018_

 **Sub-optimal planning and procurement**

Though it was unanimously stated that the MNS is one of the better funded ministries, there

were indicators that the processes for accessing funds remain arduous. According to

participants, sub-optimal planning, budgeting procurement systems and competencies

continue to significantly retard the development and operations of the Ministry.

 **Outdated processes**

Stakeholders have stated that key processes within the Ministry should be tested for

efficiencies as current systems are not producing the desired results. This was considered a

major point of resource wastage. Participants also indicated that improvement of systems,

processes and procedures ought to be a strategic focus, as this could enable the delivery of

‘more with less’.

 **Poor Human Resource Planning**

There has been a resounding plea for an improvement of Human Resource practices within

the Ministry. Employees have stated that there is need to review recruitment procedures,

competency alignment, human resource communications, training policies, promotion policies

and human resource operational efficiencies. The present human resource practices were

viewed as a major contributor to demotivated staff and grievances. Reference was also made

to the protracted responses from the Chief Personnel Officer (CPO) and the Service

Commissions Department as a major obstacle to efficient and effective human resource

practices within the Ministry.

 **Governed by outdated laws**

Internal stakeholders were emphatic that the laws governing the activities of the Ministry,

though not within its remit, are outdated and inhibit the Ministry’s responsiveness. As such,

the Ministry’s strategic plan ought to advocate for the laws governing the Ministry’s activities

to be reviewed and amended to enable the improvement of the Ministry’s overall capacity and

capability.

 **Inadequate multi-lingual staff**

Trinidad and Tobago has been viewed as an attractive destination for conducting business as

well as for those seeking a better life. This, combined with the socio-economic conditions in

neighbouring countries, has triggered an influx of persons. It has been reported that among

all illegal immigrants, South Americans are among the highest number registered within the

country. In addition there has been an increased presence of Chinese and other nationalities.


-----

_Updated: March 5[th], 2018_

Within this context, stakeholders reported that the Ministry lacks the capacity and capability

to deal effectively with this influx because of the language barrier. An increase in multilingual

capacity was recommended to strengthen the MNS’s capability to address the challenges of

migration.

 **Knowledgeable and Capable Workforce**

The Ministry of National Security is perceived as having a large knowledge pool. The Ministry

has been able to attract, retain and develop a wide spectrum of persons with varying skills,

knowledge and expertise. This fortifies the collective capability and net worth of the

organisation. With limited resources, the Ministry has been able to respond effectively to

urgent and critical situations. However, a perspective was expressed that there is a greater

need to leverage this asset by improving the work ethic in different parts of the MNS.

##### EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT


In the analysis of the external environment, Odyssey’s PESTILE (Political, Economic, Sociological,

Technological, Industry, Legal and Ecological) Model was used. The model provided the underlying

framework to conduct both secondary and primary research. Upon completion, major issues and

phenomena within the external environment emerged. The major issues discerned were:

**Political**

Politically, most stakeholders believed that Trinidad and Tobago has a relatively stable political system.

However, they highlighted that issues of continuity after a change in government or change of the

Minister pose a problem for the seamless development of the Ministry.

Further afield, there is growing nationalism, political migration and the escalating political situation in

Venezuela. The growing trend of nationalism, where nations are becoming more inwardly focused,

was viewed not only as having a political impact but also an economic and social one. It is expected

that this trend would impact on trade and the movement and migration procedures of many nationals

abroad.

Political migration focuses on persons fleeing from unrest within their homeland. With building unrest

in the Middle East, Europe and South America, political migration has become a major consideration

in the design of a strategy for the Ministry of National Security.

**Economic**

Economically, stakeholders focused on the national economy of Trinidad and Tobago. With declining

global oil and gas prices, all stakeholders felt that it would be imperative for the Ministry to do more

with less. In doing so, it was suggested that the Ministry attempts to review processes and policies

and become more efficient and innovative.

**Socio-cultural**

Discussion of the socio-cultural impact on the Ministry focused on a wide range of issues. Stakeholders

highlighted the increasing disregard for law and order, the increase in gang and gang related activities,

drug abuse and violence as common place within the national society. Focus on violence within the

home was also a major issue as most persons agreed that there has been a stark increase in child

abuse and domestic violence.


-----

_Updated: March 5[th], 2018_

Human trafficking was also highlighted as a growing problem. It was emphasized that there has been

an increase in human trafficking into Trinidad and Tobago as more South Americans are brought into

the country for use in nefarious activities.

The prevalence of white-collar crimes and corruption was also viewed as a prominent phenomenon

as most participants believed that there is a significant connection between white-collar crime,

corruption, the drug trade and violent crime.

Special mention was made on the impact of social media - the role it played in influencing public

opinion as well as the threat it poses in the security of critical information. It was suggested that new

policies must be developed to guide employees of the Ministry in their handling of information.

Finally, local extremism and its connection globally were considered a growing threat to the way of

life of the citizens of this nation. It is believed that increased permeation of extremism within the

society can lead to more violence on the streets of this country, increased support for global extremism

from Trinidad and Tobago and tarnishing of the nation’s global image.

**Technological**

Technology was seen by most as a vehicle for improvement in the delivery of national security to the

people of Trinidad and Tobago. Contributors believed that technology should become an integral part

of all the Ministry’s processes. Participants suggested that computerized management systems and

information sharing would support crime fighting initiatives and encouraged the use of technologies

such as CCTV, speed guns, GPS and drones.

The need for enhanced technology for forensic activities was also cited as an integral aspect in crime

detection. Advanced forensic technology, such as AFIS and forensic testing, have been known globally

to play a pivotal role in the detection and conviction of criminals

**Industry**

With the increasing demand for security, many private security firms have been established within

Trinidad and Tobago. Concerns were raised when focus was placed on the recruitment processes

within these firms and the regulations that govern these establishments. Contributors suggested that

greater emphasis must be placed on regulating the activities of these establishments to ensure that

proper procedures are being adhered to.

_Updated: March 5[th], 2018_

**Legal**

The review and updating of laws has become a central aspect in the provision of security and safety

to the people of Trinidad and Tobago. It should be noted that the suggestion was made for the

advocacy for a “review and update” of laws governing the MNS and it operations. Participants posited

that doing this would aid in streamlining the operations of the MNS and the judicial system.

Mention was made of the impact of the new procurement legislation on the MNS. Most candidates

believed that the process would support transparency and accountability but were concerned that it

may further retard an already slow process.

**Ecological**

The physical environment and the management of it, has also been viewed as having an impact on

the MNS. Changes in the global environment have led to an increase likelihood of natural disasters.

This phenomenon would have a direct impact on the MNS, particularly the activities of the ODPM.

Illegal quarrying and pollution were also viewed as activities impacting the operations of the MNS.

Illegal quarrying is not only punishable by law but it heightens the probability of a natural disaster

affecting the citizens of Trinidad and Tobago.

The impact of water, air, noise and earth pollution which have been prevalent particularly in sectors

such as agriculture, heavy industry, and manufacturing are also infractions which have impacted the

operations of the MNS. Monitoring of potential perpetrators and enforcement of the law once broken

are activities that would require greater resource allocation and thus should be considered within the

strategic and operational plan.

Given their substantial impact on operations of the Ministry of National Security, the following major

themes emerged and were taken into consideration in the strategy formulation process:


**Low crime**

**detection rates**


**Crime prevention** **Increasing**

**Porous Borders**
**efficacy** **Financial Crimes**


**Human**

**Trafficking**


**Influx of illegal**

**immigrants**


**Safety and hazard**

**resilience**


**Lack of public**

**trust**


**The impact of**

**technology on**

**crime and crime**

**on Technology**


**Gang Warfare**


**Youth**

**delinquency and**

**criminality in**

**depressed**

**communities**


**Violent**

**Extremism**


**Fig. 6: External Environmental Context**


-----

_Updated: March 5[th], 2018_

 **Low crime detection rates**

A low rate of detection has been identified as one of the catalysts of criminality within our

society.

 **Crime prevention efficacy**

Both internal and external stakeholders emphasized that there must be a strengthening of

crime prevention strategies to prevent persons from believing that criminal activity is the only

or easiest option for their lives. There was a call for more community-based crime prevention

activities that aim to nurture and channel minds away from crime and toward productive lives.

 **Porous Borders**

Borders that are not effectively policed facilitate human trafficking and the inflow of illegal

immigrants, arms, ammunition and drugs. This threat attracts transnational organized criminal

activities. Special mention was made of the inadequacy of current assets, infrastructure, inter
agency collaboration, legislation and personnel to guard and protect our borders.

 **Increasing Financial Crimes**

Corrupt activities and white-collar crimes are on the rise within both the public and private

sectors. Stakeholders stated that there is a prevalent belief that the authorities do not consider

white collar crime to be as destructive as serious crimes which results in less attention being

placed on surveillance and control of criminal activities within this sphere. It was further stated

that white collar crime is inextricably linked to serious crime, which, if actively and consistently

pursued, would lead to a marked increase in overall crime detection. Significant white-collar

crimes that were highlighted include:

    - Money laundering

    - Fraud

    - Bribery (Public corruption)

    - Cybercrime including ATM Fraud

    - Technology

 **Human Trafficking**

This is tied closely to our geographical location and the socio-economic climate in neighbouring

and other countries. Our porous borders have facilitated an increase in human trafficking in

Trinidad and Tobago.


-----

_Updated: March 5[th], 2018_

 **Influx of illegal immigrants**

Regionally, Trinidad and Tobago is considered a land of opportunity and wealth. This status

has resulted in an increased tendency for persons to migrate to the country. Facilitated by our

porous borders, there has been a marked increase in illegal immigrants within the nation. This

adversely impacts the nation’s resources and has the potential to increase levels of criminality.

 **Safety and hazard resilience**

Even with the introduction of the OSH Act and the EMA Act, safety practices are not rigidly

practiced or enforced within Trinidad and Tobago. Poor adherence to stipulated laws has

compromised the hazard resilience of the nation and thus increased the likelihood of hazards

becoming disasters. The role of the ODPM and its responder partner stakeholders is key in

advocating the concept and importance of Hazard Resilience.

 **Lack of public trust**

There is a lack of trust in members of the protective services. Because of this, persons within

the society are resistant to partnering with protective service representatives. Information

leaks, rogue elements, delinquency, poor processes and procedures, and lack of knowledge

were identified as some of the major impediments impacting the level of public trust.

 **Gang Warfare**

Intricately linked to porous borders and drug trafficking, gang warfare is considered prevalent

throughout many communities. It has been stated by some that this alone has contributed

most to homicides within the country.

 **Youth delinquency and criminality in depressed communities**

There is an increasing trend of juvenile delinquency being linked to gang proliferation and

youth unemployment. This is particularly prevalent in depressed communities.

 **Violent Extremism**

The increase in extremism within the society is a growing concern. The “radicalization” of

certain members of the society and the funding of terrorism is viewed as a growing threat to

local, regional and international security.

##### THE STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES


At the core of the new strategy are five (5) major imperatives that emerged as keys to achieving the

Vision of the MNS. These strategic imperatives illustrate the MNS’ commitment to public security and

safety and represent two (2) major areas of delivery that will have direct impact on the public:

1. Crime Prevention and Reduction

2. Hazard Resilience

To support these two major imperatives, three (3) other imperatives address the importance of

enabling strategies that will facilitate the achievement of the MNS Vision and Mission.

3. Stakeholder Partnership and Collaboration

4. Governance

5. Capacity and Capability Resourcing and Optimisation

**Reduction** **AND VISION**

**Fig. 8: MNS Strategic Imperatives**


-----

_Updated: March 5[th], 2018_

At the centre of the MNS strategy are five (5) fundamental pillars which act as the framework on

which the Strategic Imperatives (SIs) have been built. These pillars are Prediction, Deterrence,

Detection, Prosecution and Rehabilitation, and are the raison d’être of the plan. At every stage in the

plan, these pillars in some way are referenced.


**Prediction:**


The diagnostics that provided the context for this plan recognized the need to reduce crime as well

as address the fear of crime. The public expects and demands an MNS that is much more proactive

and preemptive in keeping them safe. The expectation is that the increased use of modern technology

would enhance the MNS’ ability to predict and thereby prevent crime. Moreover, in a resource
constrained environment, the plan aims to optimize resources through leveraging the skills and

competencies of internal and external stakeholders.


**Detection:**


A major concern of the public has been the rate of crime detection. The plan articulates a strategy to

improve our competencies, reengineer policies and structures, and improve our stakeholder

collaboration. The MNS will seek to develop and enhance the necessary tools, techniques and systems

to achieve the desired outcome.


**Deterrence:**


This principle is very closely tied to prediction. The plan has been developed not just to address and

respond to crimes committed through stronger law enforcement measures, but to implement plans

and programmes that will discourage crimes. In many instances, the plan seeks to engender

communities that deter crime by way of taking a more active role in the development of stronger

neighborhoods. These include the implementation of a National Crime Prevention Programme,

rehabilitative and reintegration initiatives, the use of electronic monitoring and other strategies

implemented by the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service, Trinidad and Tobago Prison Service and the

Trinidad and Tobago Defence Force.


**Prosecution:**


While the MNS does not have full jurisdiction over prosecution, its supporting role is critical as part of

the criminal justice system. The MNS in recognising the importance of prosecution not just as a means

of enforcing the law but also as a deterrent for further crime, has sought through the plan to improve

efficiency at the Trinidad and Tobago Forensic Science Centre and implement A more effective and

integrative case management system to effect speedier prosecution of crime. The imperatives of Crime

Prevention and Reduction, Stakeholder Partnership and Governance speak to this responsibility.


-----

_Updated: March 5[th], 2018_


**Rehabilitation:**


At the core of this plan is the aim to transform the Prison Service to Correctional Services through the

establishment of a Prison Management Policy. This transformation is based on the premise that our

priority in the Prison Service should be much more about rehabilitation than retribution. The plan

seeks to advance and actualize this concept through initiatives that address penal transformation that

are steeped in a wider context of preparation for reintegration and improving the rates of recidivism.

##### STRATEGY MAP


The Strategy Map below provides a clear illustration of the major areas of focus of the MNS Strategic

Plan. The map is an adaptation of the Balanced Scorecard approach and shows the importance of

establishing a strong foundation of capacity and capability in human resources, physical infrastructure,

ICT and technology. This foundation supports the design or redesign or reengineering of key

operational elements that include systems, policies, processes, and structures. These operational

elements are designed to improve the levels of efficacy in decision-making, ideation/innovation and

task execution. In many areas, the foundational areas of capacity and capability have a direct impact

on the achievement of final deliverables within public safety and security.

The top of the strategy map illustrates the major deliverables and their value to the public -- greater

**public safety and** **increased public security. Public safety is specifically articulated within the**

realm of hazard resilience, and speaks to inculcating and building a culture, systems and approaches

that increase the level of resilience to hazards, and thus increase the level of public safety. Public

security captures elements that aim to both reduce and prevent crime.

##### RISK MITIGATION FRAMEWORK


This Risk Mitigation Framework represents a distillation of the major risks and mitigators in the Operational Plan (Appendix II). What has

emerged is a clustering of four major types of Risks that should be assessed and then urgently addressed. The major types of risks are:

    - Resource Risks: Are critical resources available in time?

    - Process Risks: Are there current systems and processes that will impede execution?

    - Capacity Risks: Are there capacity issues that will retard progress?

    - Risks of Staff Commitment and Synergy: How much will staff buy-in and support affect execution?

|RESOURCES|Col2|PROCESSES|Col4|CAPACITY|Col6|STAFF COMMITMENT AND SYNERGY|Col8|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Risks/Obstacles|Mitigator|Risks/Obstacles|Mitigator|Risks/Obstacles|Mitigator|Risks/Obstacles|Mitigator|
|Lack of SMEs (Subject Matter Experts)|Timely procurement of SMEs Internal development of SME capability|Delayed decision-making|HoD buy-in Proactive Monitoring and Evaluation Reengineered processes|Delayed TTFSC relocation|Strong lobbying to Cabinet for funding and approvals HoD support Structured project management|Competing ideologies|Cabinet/Ministerial Directive HoD buy-in|
|Lack of funding Shifting priorities|Strong and convincing advocacy and lobbying to Cabinet|Delayed/poor reporting|Reengineered reporting processes and templates|Delayed TTFSC Lab Accreditation|Timely procurement of accreditation SME Structured project management|Duplication of efforts|HoD buy-in Reengineered policies and processes|

##### CONCLUSION


In the face of a continuously changing external environment, the Ministry of National Security must

be adaptable and resilient. Thus, this Strategic Plan will be treated as a living document, subject to

review and revision along the way. The initiatives in the Plan aim to change the current environment

significantly to realize the desired outcomes with respect to public safety and security.

This is an ambitious but manageable plan with many actionable elements. However, not all things can

be achieved at once, taking cognizance of the current economic climate. As such, the plan reflects

some inevitable sequencing, especially for elements that will require additional resources or clear

points of focus. As practitioners, we will seize on opportunities for efficiencies and savings in terms of

both time and money which may require adjustments to some of our ongoing activities.

This plan aims to be comprehensive, addressing both practical needs at the Ministry level, and policy

and planning needs at a nation-wide level. As a result, this plan should be viewed as the first step in

a long-term process to ensure continued effective and responsible governance. To this end, annual

reviews of progress against each of the five (5) Strategic Imperatives, a mid-term assessment of the

strategy in Year Two (2020) and a major review in Year Four (2022) will be conducted to assess how

effective the current plan has been in meeting objectives.

It is essential to keep the momentum going in order to ensure continuous improvement. The spirit of

collaboration, innovation and resource optimization that were imbued in the plan from the start must

be sustained to propel the plan to actualization and realization. It is also essential that the leadership

commitment exhibited to date continues, and that managers and staff be provided with the support

and guidance necessary to bring this plan to fruition.

Ultimately, it is expected that through the successful implementation of this plan, the MNS will be

better prepared to significantly change the current environment with respect to public safety and

security of all citizens of Trinidad and Tobago.

_Updated: March 5[th], 2018_


###### APPENDIX I – MINISTRY OF NATIONAL SECURITY ORGANISATION STRUCTURE


-----

_Updated: March 5[th], 2018_

###### APPENDIX II - 24-MONTH OPERATIONAL PLAN WITH RACI

The monitoring and evaluation framework is critical for the effective performance management of the strategy over the period. It identifies

the specific strategies, initiatives and respective measures and targets. Additionally, the M&E framework will identify initiative timelines and

the associated RACI matrix for the period.

Where there are teams with cross-department and inter-organisational collaboration, it is very important to create a process to track

responsibilities.

One of the important tools for tracking roles and responsibilities is the Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RACI matrix). RACI stands for:

 Responsible – Who is responsible for the execution of the initiative/ task?

 Accountable – Who is accountable for the tasks and signs off the work?

 Consulted – Who are the subject matter experts to be consulted?

 Informed – Who needs to be updated on the progress?
