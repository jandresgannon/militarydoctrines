##### OPENING STATEMENT MINISTER OF DEFENCE OF UKRAINE

The year of 2014 has become a test of courage, endurance, oath and national loyalty
of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It went down in history as the Restoration Year of
the Ukrainian Army.
The annexation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol
as well as the support to insurgency over the most part of Donetsk and Luhansk regions
by the Russian Federation resulted in violation of territorial integrity and sovereignty
of Ukraine. This was the beginning of the Hybrid War against the sovereign Ukraine.
Today, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are fi ghting against a well-armed and trained
enemy. This confl ict has already claimed the lives of thousands of our citizens and led
to enormous destruction of infrastructure in the temporarily occupied territories.
It is under these conditions of intense and multifaceted struggle in military,
information, economic, and other domains that we had to restore the combat readiness
of military units and establish the formation of forces that would be capable of
defending the country.
We have nearly doubled the defence budget of 2014 in order to implement all of the
priority measures for strengthening the defence capabilities of our country. We have
reviewed and changed the plans for training and application of the Armed Forces of
Ukraine given the real politico-military situation and its contingencies, and we have
conducted several waves of partial mobilization to implement these plans. Over 110,000
people were conscripted and nearly 6,200 vehicles were mobilized from the national
economy, and this work continues. The total strength of the Armed Forces of Ukraine
was expanded to 250,000. We have considerably increased our forces in the Eastern
Ukraine and established fi ve combined task forces and a formation of Air Force. We
have deployed 10 additional brigades and a regiment. The experience gained throughout
the antiterrorist operation and all the best learned from the armies of NATO membercountries were used for the development of a new command and control system of
forces and implementation of new standards for the training of forces and military
command.
Joint efforts of public authorities have improved the system of recovery,
refurbishment, and repair of the materiel, which allowed to procure, restore, and supply
the troops with over 3,000 pieces of weapons and equipment.


-----

The rates of equipping the Armed Forces of Ukraine with new and refurbished types
of weapons as well as military and special equipment and logistics have grown by one
third. I am sincerely grateful to volunteers, who act above and beyond the call of duty
in assisting the Ukrainian army.
The actions taken by the state leadership to protect the independence, sovereignty,
and territorial integrity of Ukraine have a powerful diplomatic, expert, and humanitarian
support from the leading democratic countries of the European Union and NATO. A
total of 14 member-countries provided Ukraine with logistical assistance in 2014.
The Ministry of Defence of Ukraine has initiated a range of radical changes to
develop and strengthen the agency. We have conducted the Defence Review to determine
the directions for reforms. Its results shall be used for drafting the new edition of
documents on Defence Planning, which lay the foundation for the programs on the
development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other components of the Security
and Defence Sector.
The active participation of volunteers at the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine and
other public associations has resulted in a number of reforms that would change the
situation with the living arrangements for servicemen and their families as well as the
control over the military real estate, nutrition, clothing allowance, and medical support.
We have already simplified the bidding procedure and introduced the Electronic
Public Procurement System. The decision was made to have a mixed form of manning
for the Armed Forces of Ukraine (conscription and enlistment on the contract basis).
This will allow to create a reliable personnel reserve for the Armed Forces.
A number of amendments were introduced into the legislation to overcome certain
complications with the mobilization process, expand the role of forces in the AntiTerrorist Operation, improve logistics as well as social, financial, and legal support of
servicemen and their families.
We have shown the readiness to defend our country, we have learned how to fight,
and we have what to fight with. There is still a lot of hard and responsible work to do
in order to fulfil all of tasks identified in the national strategic documents, to include
the Coalition Agreement between parliamentary factions “European Ukraine”, Strategy
on Sustainable Development “Ukraine - 2020”, and the Program of the Cabinet of
Ministers of Ukraine.
Together we can create new Armed Forces of Ukraine – with optimum strength,
well equipped, highly trained, fully supported and staffed with true professionals – that
would be a reliable defender to Ukraine.
I have no doubt that we can win together!

Improving principals of the state policy in the defence sector

Ukraine turned out to be in the most difficult situation since the proclamation of its
independence. Deliberate prolonged intervention of the Russian Federation in internal
affairs of Ukraine, support to terrorist activities of illegal armed groups in certain
areas of Donetsk and Luhansk regions resulted in violation of territorial integrity,
inviolability of Ukraine’s borders and escalation of situation in the east of the state.
The arisen conflict has already claimed the lives of thousands of our citizens and
led to enormous destruction of infrastructure in the temporarily occupied territories.
The non-block status of Ukraine, which was enshrined in 2010 by the Law of
Ukraine “On the Foundations of Domestic and Foreign Policy”, has proved to be
ineffective in the context of state security from external aggression and pressure.
International commitments to respect the independence, sovereignty and inviolability
of borders of Ukraine were not those sufficient tools able to guarantee the external
security of our country.
As a result, in 2014 the need arose for radical changes in the approaches to develop
principals of the state policy in the defence sector, namely:

  - the non-block status of Ukraine was abolished, which made it possible to
implement more effective mechanisms to protect the independence, sovereignty
and territorial integrity of states given the irreversibility of the external course
aimed at the membership in the European Union[1];

  - the execution of the activities of the State Complex Program for the Reform
and Development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for the period till 2017 was
suspended, as such, which does not meet modern politico-military situation
and does not provide the direction of the available state resources at priority
directions of the Armed Forces development[2];

Three waves of partial mobilization were conducted during 2014. 159 military units
of the Armed Forces and 39 military units of other military formations and special
purpose law enforcement agencies were put into operational readiness.
Over 110,000 people were conscripted from the reserve and nearly 6,200 vehicles
were mobilized from the national economy for the roundout of the designated military
units, including 95,400 draft-age persons and 5,500 vehicles for the Armed Forces
needs.
Military commissariats system was optimized and the procedure of manning with
contracted personnel was improved. It has three consecutive and interconnected levels
of selection (district military commissariat – regional military commissariat – military
unit). Thereby military commissariats held the enlistment only while the commander
was responsible for the quality of selection and admission to military service. The
rotation of military commissars sent to key personnel positions at military units with
completed mobilisation was conducted.
Terms of the involvement (use) of forces and assets of the Armed Forces (personnel
and experts of separate detachments, military units, weapons, military equipment and
special vehicles, communications and other logistic means) in the areas of the largescale, complex anti-terrorist operations were specified at the legislative level[12].
Forces and assets of the Armed Forces, other military formations and law
enforcement agencies conducted more than 40 operations, released over a hundred
populated areas of Donetsk and Luhansk regions during May-September 2014.
1,373 soldiers were killed; 5,419 were injured; about 300 went missing and about
800 were in captivity in the course of anti-terrorist operation.
The negative experience of the first waves of partial mobilisation was taken into
consideration where mobilisation resources were sent to replenish detachments and
military units directly to the area of anti-terrorist operation that led to the abandonment
of post by up to 30% of soldiers due to the unpreparedness of personnel, poor trainability
and insufficient mental stability. Afterwards, the number of people who refused to
take part in the anti-terrorist operation was less than 1% owing to the organization of
preliminary training of mobilized soldiers in training centres.

Overall in 2014 criminal investigations against 8,490 soldiers were launched based
on the evasion of military service and registered in the Unified Register of Pre-Trial
Investigations. 2,287 soldiers out of them are investigated according to the Article
407 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine “Unauthorized Abandonment of a Military
Unit”; 4,880 soldiers – according to the Article 408 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine
“Desertion”; and 1,323 soldiers – according to the Article 409 of the Criminal Code of
Ukraine “Evasion of Military Service By Self-Mutilation or Other Means”.
However, the vast majority of servicemen of the Armed Forces showed personal
courage and heroism in the defence of state sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Ukraine, selfless service to the Ukrainian people. More than 6,500 of servicemen were
awarded the state awards in 2014 (see Chapter 6).
Minsk Protocol and Minsk Memorandum were signed on September 5 and
September 19, 2014 to put an end to the conflict in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of
Ukraine. Declaration by the President of Ukraine, the President of the French Republic,
the President of the Russian Federation and the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of
Germany in support of the “Package of Measures for the Implementation of the Minsk
Agreements” was adopted according to the results of lengthy negotiations.

Logistics support

The transition of the logistics support of the Armed Forces, based on the territorial
principle, into functioning under the conditions of anti-terrorist operation was conducted
along with the enlargement of troops (forces) in separate parts of Donetsk and Luhansk
regions. The volunteer movement undertook a considerable part of problems of the
Armed Forces at the stage of the deployment of logistics support (see Chapters 2, 6).
Due to the decisive actions of the state leaders troops

RESULTS OF THE ACTIVITIES ON STRENGTHENING THE DEFENCE CAPACITY

104,500 servicemen were provided with _equipment, other than principal items_
during the year, including with new field uniform in full.
Modern individual means of protection (new armour vests, bulletproof Kevlar
helmets), equipment and facilities (unloading systems, knee-pads, elbow-pads, raid
backpacks, protective goggles, rubber boots, tents, sleeping bags, mats etc.) were put
into service to supply the Armed Forces based on the results of combat tests.
At the end of 2014 servicemen involved in the anti-terrorist operation were provided
with equipment, other than principal items 100%, bulletproof vests – 95%, bulletproof
steel helmets – 100%, bulletproof Kevlar helmets – 23%.

Medical support

The main task of the medical service was to provide medical units of military units
and military medical facilities with necessary equipment, medicines, dressings
and individual means of medical protection, as well as the ability to carry out the
evacuation of wounded persons from the battlefield.
The main problems of troops (forces) medical support in the area of anti-terrorist
operation included the lack of stationary military medical functions, isolation and
detachment from the main forces of troops performing combat tasks.
This resulted in the need to provide medical treatment in the combat area and involve
air transport to the evacuation of wounded. Treatment of servicemen was organized in
the proximate military or civilian medical institutions, where 30% of hospital beds
were provided for the Armed Forces needs in coordination with the Ministry of Health.
Helicopters Mi-8 and AN-26 “Vita” aircraft were used for the emergency evacuation,
and transported 90% of wounded from the combat area.
31[st] mobile medical brigade was got ready and two mobile military hospitals were
deployed to provide skilled medical treatment in the areas of anti-terrorist operation. In
addition, two mobile military hospitals were in reserve. Overall 23 military hospitals
with a total capacity of 5,830 beds provided qualified and specialized medical
treatment.
Due to the taken measures it became possible to solve the main problems of medical
support of troops, military units and detachments participating in the anti-terrorist
operation.

  - armament and materiel – UAH 4,253.8 million (15.8% of the total amount).
The analysis of the allocated resources (Figure 1.3) shows that finances were mainly
directed towards the maintenance of the Armed Forces and, considering scarcity, did not
meet allocation practices, accepted among leading countries of the world. The increase of
finances allocated on weapons and materiel (by 5.7%) is not enough for the appropriate
support of the Armed Forces.
Under the conditions of continual multiannual insufficient financial support of
the Armed Forces, the increase of financial resources for the needs of the Ministry
of Defence in 2014, due to the Reserve Fund, by UAH 11.9 billion, did not provide
considerable increase of the level of combat effectiveness of the Armed Forces.
Financial support of armament and materiel development efforts, replenishment of
emergency supplies, as well as maintenance of troops (forces) training system was
carried out on a minimal level.

  - Formation of regular workshop on issues of cooperation with the General
Prosecutor’s Office of Ukraine;

  - Formation of Scientific Centre for prevention and fighting the corruption;

  - Carrying out of anti-corruption analysis in nine areas of the activity of the
Ministry of Defence, mainly including the alienation and disposal of military
property; procurement of goods, works or services at state expenses; disposal of
rocket fuel components and ammunition; petroleum, oil, lubricants and fuel oil
supplies for the Armed Forces; clothing and gear provisions; lease relations; bath
and laundry services; medical support; food-stuff provisions;

  - Listing the range of high-risk positions at the Ministry of Defence;

  - Check-up of a real state of activity of five structural subdivisions of the economic
block at the Ministry of Defence dealing with the support to the organization of
carrying out the procedures of state procurements, supply of material resources
and the implementation of a range of works (services) for the needs of the Armed
Forces, support of economic activity, carrying out of capital construction as well
as the procurement and housing distribution.

  - Carrying out of internal investigations related to the procedure of procurement
and quality control over armour vests, petroleum, oil and lubricants, cases of
corruption in the activity of military registration and enlistment offices during
mobilization;

  - Treatment of 246 requests concerning prevention and detection of corruption,
applied by people, among them 17 anonymous ones.
According to the results of inspections and internal investigations, the materials
were transferred to law-enforcement agencies and the number of alleged financial
violations, amounting to over UAH 30 million, was prevented.

**The result of the implementation of activities directed towards the strengthening**
**of national defence capability in 2014 was the three waves of limited mobilization,**
**bringing of military units of the Armed Forces to the state of combat readiness and**

#### COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM OF THE ARMED FORCES, THEIR STRUCTURE AND MANPOWER

ommand and control system of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 2014 was brought to the functioning
### Cunder the conditions of a special period. During this year, a series of actions, directed towards the
improvement of the effectiveness of operational and combat command and control over forces and
means, mainly those participating in antiterrorist operation, was implemented.


THE IMPROVEMENT
OF THE COMMAND
AND CONTROL
SYSTEM OF THE
ARMED FORCES


At the end of 2014 the command and control system included (Figure 2.1):
_– Strategic level – the Ministry of Defence, the General Staff of the Armed Forces,_
Logistics, Armament, Main Directorate of Operational Support, Main Command
Centre;
− _Operational-strategic level_ – the Services’ Commands, Command of High
Mobility Assault Forces of the Armed Forces;
− _Operational level – Operational Commands “North”, “South”, the 8th Army_
Corps’ Command, Air Commands of the Air Forces;
− _Tactical level – Command of Brigades, Regiments, Bases, Depots, Arsenals and_
other military units.
Last years the Armed Forces faced signifi cant structural changes. The distribution
of operational, administrative functions and functions related to the overall
support of troops (forces) among command and control bodies of all branches was
improved.
The proposal to introduce brand new command and control system over troops
(forces) was not successful, mainly in the area of informational support of combat
actions, however it could provide the ability to apply precision weapons.

COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM OF THE ARMED FORCES

The experience of assigned units of the Armed Forces that participated in antiterrorist
operation in separate districts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblast has shown limited
technical capabilities of command and control bodies in relation to the management of
troops (forces) and low level of their manning with trained personnel.
In order to enable the system of command and control over troops (forces) meet
current challenges and threats the following activities were implemented:

                - Formation of Operation Headquarters of joint force groupings of troops (forces)
in order to provide the participation of the assigned units of the Armed Forces
in antiterrorist operation, deployment of subsystem of fixed and mobile points
of command and control over troops (forces): subpoint of the Operation
Headquarters Command, sector command points;

                - Upbuilding of fixed networks with wire-connected, radio-relay and troposcatter
communication links. Deployment of radio- and satellite transmission facilities.
In general, more than 100 communications centres were engaged, being provided
with modern facilities and military equipment;

                - Equipment of fixed informational and telecommunication nodes of control points
with digital communication gears;

                - Support of the Armed Forces with digital short-wave and ultra short-wave means
of radio communication, radio-relay stations, satellite and trunking transmission
facilities;

                - Formation of single special-purpose telecommunication network, which connects
informational and telecommunication nodes of all levels.
Moreover, the development of a single automated command and control system of
the Armed Forces continued. The following activities have been carried out:

               - Implementation of the electronic document management system at the Ministry
of Defence and the General Staff;

                - Establishment of an accredited key certification centre of the Armed Forces;

                - Testing of separate elements of automated command and control system over the
Land Forces, Aviation and Air Defence at a tactical level.

Strategic Level of Command

In order to provide proper reaction on real and predicted challenges and threats,
as well as to facilitate the improvement of the effectiveness of the activity of the
Ministry of Defence as a central executive authority, new version of the Regulation
on the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine has been developed and approved[1].
During the year, the organizational and staff structure of the Ministry of Defence
was optimized in accordance with the functional principle and, besides, nine structural
subdivisions of the apparatus were reorganized:

               - Increase of the exercise of powers of the Ministry of Defence in areas of
alienation and disposal of military property, environmental security and fighting
the corruption. The Department for alienation and disposal of military property
was formed (due to unification of the Department for alienation of military
property and the Department for the disposal of rocket fuel components and
ammunition), as well as the Directorate for environmental security and anti-mine
activity and the Directorate for Prevention and detection of corruption;

               - Formation of new components at three structural subdivisions for operational
handling of urgent problems under the conditions of complicated politico-military
situation: at the Department of Personnel Policy – office on the implementation
of the Law of Ukraine “On the purification of government”, at the Department
of Defence Policy and Strategic Planning – office on strategic assessments,
at the Press Information Department – sector of informational support
(Press Service);

               - Improvement of mechanisms for the cooperation with central executive bodies:
Office on Cooperation with the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, the Department for

COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM OF THE ARMED FORCES

Administration, was reorganized into the office on coordination of cooperation
with state government authorities of Ukraine;

                - In view of urgent problems of the Armed Forces and new distribution of functions
at strategic level, the responsibility over the Department for organization and
support of the refurbishment of armament and materiel was delegated by the
Ministry of Defence to the General Staff of the Armed Forces;

                - Due to the transfer of tasks related to the guidance and coordination of the
activity from the State Service of Ukraine for Emergency Situations to the
Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, the Directorate for cooperation with the
State Service of Ukraine for Emergency Situations was disbanded.
In order to find solutions to problems related to logistic support of troops (forces),
representatives of volunteer organizations got permanent appointments at corresponding
departments and directorates of the Ministry of Defence and the Logistic Service of the
Armed Forces, being responsible for the following:

               - at the Department for Personnel Policy: awarding of personnel and formation
of personnel reserve from among servicemen who took part in antiterrorist
operation;

               - at the Department for State Procurement and Supply of Material Resources:
operational monitoring over price offers and information on supply and timely
procurement of property, petroleum, oil, lubricants and food supplies;

               - at the Logistic Service of the Armed Forces: food and clothing supplies,
petroleum, oil and lubricants supplies as well as control over the transportation
of procured property, facilities and equipment to military units.
All organizational activities were carried out by the efforts of the whole strength
of the apparatus of the Ministry of Defence, accounting for nearly 770 regular
appointments[2].
In general the structure of the General Staff met tasks and objectives assigned by the
President of Ukraine – Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, related
to the support of partial mobilization activities, improvement of combat readiness and
effectiveness of troops (forces), training and participation of the assigned forces and
means in antiterrorist operation.
At the same time The Directorate for Civil and Military cooperation was formed
with an aim to develop multifaceted cooperation with civil organizations, mainly
volunteer ones.
The structure of the apparatus of the Ministry of Defence and the General Staff at
the end of 2014 is given in Annex 3.

Operational and Strategic Level of Command

Operational and Strategic Level of Command over troops (forces) was separated
out as the result of the complex activities, related to the restoration of operational
capability of the Command System of the Armed Forces.
The Operational and Strategic Level of Command includes four components:

              - The Services’ Commands – The Land Forces, the Air Forces and the Naval
Forces;

               - Command of High Mobility Assault Forces.
In 2014 the situation at the Naval Forces significantly grew worse with the loss of a large
number of ship-borne and airborne strength, almost all fleet armament stocks, military and
special materiel, material reserves etc, that happened as a result of the annexation of the
Autonomous Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol city by the Russian Federation.
The Naval Forces were left without equipped home stations, maintenance and
refurbishment stations, equipment, educational institutions, training ranges, housing and
barracks properties.

COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM OF THE ARMED FORCES

During the year, the complex of activities was carried out, directed towards the
redeployment of the Naval Forces Command in Odessa city and bringing of its
organizational and staff structure to correspondence with the tasks, as well as with
forces and means available.

Operational Level of Command

In 2014 the development of command and control bodies of Operational Level
continued and following activities were carried out:

               - • Formation of the vertical chain of operational command over forces and means,
engaged into antiterrorist operation, on the basis of Operational Commands
“North”, “South”. Generally five multiservice grouping of troops (forces) and
the Air Force groupings were formed;

               - Cancellation of activities related to the disbandment of Western and Eastern
Operational Commands;

               - Cancellation of activities related to the restructuring of “Centre”, “West” and
“South” Air Commands as well as the 8[th] Army Corps’ Command;

               - Improvement of the role and authorities of operational level commands during
the conduct of combat actions.

Tactical Level of Command
The components of the command and control over troops (forces) at a tactical level
did not experience significant changes during the year. Brigades (regiments) continue
to be the highest command and control bodies of this level. The main combat unit is
military subdivision of a “battalion” level.
During the year, following the results of mobilization deployment of troops (forces),
4 brigades and 29 battalions of territorial defence were formed, which soon were
restructured into separate mechanized infantry battalions.

At the end of 2014 after a number of organizational activities the manning of the Armed
Forces amounted to 250 thousand people, including 204 thousand of servicemen.
The increase by 84.5 thousand was realized within the figures, determined by the
legislation of Ukraine (Annex 3).
The correlation between combat military units and support units is given
on Figure 2.2.
During the year the scheduled realization of activities related to the formation of
High Mobility Assault Forces and Special Operations Forces continued.
Proceeding from the necessity to save lives and health, to meet the interests and
legal rights of servicemen and workers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, military units
(subdivisions), institutions and organizations of the Armed Forces were redeployed from
temporarily occupied territory of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol
city to other regions of Ukraine[3].

he main problem of supplying the Armed Forces with armament and materiel is the critical weakness
### Tof terms to equip troops (forces) with new (refurbished) samples to replace morally and physically

aged armament.


SUPPLIES OF THE
ARMAMENT AND
MATERIEL


The financial resources, allocated for the activities related to the development of
armament and materiel in 2014 decreased by 2.5 times in comparison with 2013 (11.9
% of the need). At the same time, due to the additional allocations by the Cabinet of
Ministers of Ukraine on the needs of the Armed Forces, the total share of the general
fund on armament and materiel was increased up to 61%, which made it possible to
carry out scheduled tasks.
Under these conditions over 98% of allocated resources were directed towards the
refurbishment of available and procurement of new armament and materiel and 2%
towards the financial support of research and design activities, currently on the stage
of state (preliminary) testing and manufacturing of a testing sample.
The main efforts were concentrated on the
improvement of the state of the most problematic
samples of armament and materiel. At the beginning
of antiterrorist operation in the eastern part of Ukraine,
subdivisions of the Armed Forces did not have a
single serviceable complex of sound-ranging and
radar reconnaissance, which made it impossible to
apply artillery as part of reconnaissance fire weapon
complex. Aircraft and helicopters were not equipped
with modern protective gears against air defence guided
missiles. The available refurbished and new armament,
received in single samples, did not influence the combat
effectiveness of units and subdivisions.
In order to provide the implementation of planned
activities, a range of administrative decisions has been
introduced, which were directed towards the improvement of the manufacture and
supplies of armament and materiel, mainly:

  - The simplification of the procedure for advance payment in process of
procurement, refurbishment and repair of armament, military and special
materiel under the conditions of a special period, announcement of the state of
emergency and in course of antiterrorist operation[1];

  - Adjustment of the procedure for passing into service (supplies) of the Armed
Forces of Ukraine the foreign-manufactured armament and material[2];

  - Finding the mechanism for the withdrawal and transfer of armament, combat and
other equipment and ammunition[3].

RESULTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT, REFURBISHMENT, SUPPLIES, RENEWAL AND DISPOSAL

As a result of conducted activities the level of the support with armament and
materiel provided for the Armed Forces has largely increased, mainly:

              - 13 samples of armament and materiel, particularly SU-27S1M and SU-27P1M
combat aircraft, SU-27UB1M and SU-27UP1M training combat aircraft,
Mi-8MSB-V amphibious transport helicopter, R-330UM automated complex of
radio interference, ground hardware and software system for the control and
processing of flight information of aircraft were passed into service (supplies);

                     - 371 samples of new and refurbished samples of armament and materiel were
procured and supplied. Moreover, in order to provide support to the participation
of troops (forces) in antiterrorist operation 1724 additional samples were procured
and supplied, including refurbished aircraft and helicopters, “Bulat” tanks, BTR-3
and BTR-4 armoured personnel carriers, 2S1 self-propelled mounts, “Stugna-P’
antitank missile system, small armoured gunboats, radioelectronic warfare
equipment, navigation aids and other armament (Table 3.1);

Restoration of the Technical Readiness of Materiel

The provision of logistics support for the Armed Forces units, which are involved in the
ongoing anti-terrorist operation, requires urgent measures and improved maintenance
system. To respond to these challenges the following steps were taken:

              - • In cooperation with the State Concern “Ukroboronprom” the rapid response
measures on restoration and provision of military materiel for operating forces
were agreed, and the required interaction between the Ministry of Defence and
the domestic defence enterprises was organized.

              - The executive authorities established enhanced cooperation with charitable
organizations and volunteers for the logistical support of combat and service
forces;

RESULTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT, REFURBISHMENT, SUPPLIES, RENEWAL AND DISPOSAL

        - The decision about repairing and returning weapon systems and equipment,
which was stored at military bases, storage depots and centres, was taken.
It allowed repairing and returns of damaged or disabled artillery systems,
armoured and other equipment to using units in shorter terms and at lower costs.

         - In a zone of carrying out anti-terrorist operation using the maintenance units
of Armed Forces and mobile repair teams of defence enterprises more than
50 evacuation-repair sections and recovery teams were formed, 5 mobile storage
depots were deployed.
As a result, in total about 20 thousand weapon systems and critical items were
restored to a state of combat readiness. The state-owned defence enterprises have
provided more than 900 items of repaired weapon systems and equipment (Table 3.2).

The disposal of surplus rockets, ammunition and rocket fuel components unsuitable
for further usage and storage remains one of the main problems of reorganization and
optimization of the Armed Forces, the solution of which depends on funding.

Disposal of rockets and ammunition

In 2014, the actual budget allocation for the implementation of the State Target
Defence Programme of Disposal of Conventional Ammunition Unsuitable for further
Usage and Storage for 2008-2017 (State Disposal Programme) was UAH 74.2 million
(15% of the baseline requirement envisaged by the State Disposal Programme).
More than 6,500 tons of ammunition has been disposed of during the past year
(Table 3.3).

The summary of the State Disposal Programme implementation in 2008-2014 shows
that about 219,000 tons of conventional ammunitions unsuitable for further usage and
storage were disposed of, which is 45.2% of programme indicators (484,200 tons).


-----

RESULTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT, REFURBISHMENT, SUPPLIES, RENEWAL AND DISPOSAL

The ammunition disposal rate has declined significantly during the past year due to
the redistribution of the conventional munitions to be disposed of in the years 20122016[4], as well as the main enterprises’ location, which are involved in the State Disposal
Programme, at the nearby area of the anti-terrorist operation.

Disposal of Liquid Rocket Fuel Components

The implementation measures of the State Target Programme of Disposal of Liquid
Rocket Fuel Components for 2010-2014 continued in 2014[5].
On the 6[th] of March 2014 in the framework of the international contract on provision
of services connected with the disposal of melange between the Ministry of Defence,
OSCE Secretariat and Russian closed joint-stock company “Technoazot”, federal state
enterprises “Sverdlov Plant” and “Biisk Oleum Plant” the last part of 1,191 tons of
mélange was deported for its further disposal outside Ukraine.
In 2008-2014 15.682 thousand tons of mélange were withdrawn from military units
of the Armed Forces for its further disposal. The joint OSCE - Ukraine international
project on rocket fuel component (RFC) mélange disposal was completed[6].
In addition, there were neutralized (disposed) the following liquid rocket fuel
components:

               - by the Armed Forces – 37.39 tons of sub-standard mélange and 15.7 tons of other
sub-standard amyl;

              - under the contracts with the defence enterprises – 11.1 tons of izonit and
53.4 tons of samin.
During the year, in total, about 1.309 thousand tons of liquid rocket fuel components
were disposed (Table 3.4).

#### FORCES’ TRAINING

n 2014, the results of military operations and their compliance with the stated objectives, for the first time
### Iin the history of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, have become the key criteria for determining efficiency

and effectiveness of the training system. The training process in 2014 was focused on mission-specific
and function-specific issues; improvement of command and control system by adapting the experience
gained to the conditions of the theatre of operations and the mission environment; enhancing their
capabilities to successfully conduct combat operations and territorial defence in conjunction with other
military formations and law enforcement agencies.


FORCES’ TRAINING
SUPPORT


During the year, the training activities were extremely practical and focused on
field-related issues. Those activities have enabled development of interpersonal and
practical skills of military units to be active team members and to operate smoothly
in the respective area of assignment. Therefore the combat crew training sessions
were conducted on real military equipment, live fire training was performed with live
munitions using individual weapons and collective weapon systems of military units.
The priority directions of military training in 2014 were the following:

  - achieving operational interoperability among staffs; ensuring their capability
to quickly and efficiently plan the use of and effectively control the groupings
of troops (forces) during combat operations in conjunction with other military
formations and law enforcement agencies;

  - maintaining combat readiness of military units to perform specific tasks in the
respective areas of their assignment; improving practical skills of personnel
in the preparation of arms and military equipment for combat use; performing
on-site repair of damaged or inoperable equipment, construction of protective
structures and defensive obstacles, roadblocks; providing security for bases and
conducting base defence;

  - conducting specialized training of units after the partial loss of their combat
capabilities and providing rotations in the areas of their engagement; building
mobilization capabilities of reserve forces and providing them with credible
combat capabilities;

  - ensuring the operational readiness of designated units defending state facilities
against military aviation attacks from the air;

  - conducting refresher training for aircrews in aviation units.
Despite the increase in total funding of defence needs in 2014, the financial resources
available for training remained at the previous year’s level. In total for training needs
the Armed Forces of Ukraine received UAH 292.6 million that is 93.6% of the planned
amount (Table 4.1).

The reorganization of training system of the Armed Forces, which has been carried out
in previous years, as well as timely clarified training plans and combat coordination
(restoration of combat capability) had a positive effect on skill formation in 2014.
All training activities were goal-oriented and corresponding to the mission assigned
to each military unit and formation (Note 4.1).
Multi-service training ensured the formation and improvement of combat skills of
all military units participating in conjunction with different branches and services of
the Armed Forces, special purpose units, formations of the National Guard and the State
Border Service. The acquired combat experience has been actively implemented by all
military formations of Ukraine.
To obtain operational capability command and control bodies, formations, large and
small units, have increased the number of tactical exercises only since the beginning of
the Russian military aggression against Ukraine. Up until then the joint tactical training
of military units and formations, honing their skills especially in live fire exercises, had
been conducted in insufficient quantities and at a much smaller scale.
In total across the whole of the Armed Forces the following exercises were
undertaken: 18 – battalion tactical exercises, 192 – company tactical exercises,
6 –squadron tactical flight exercises, 325 – platoon live fire training exercises, over
16 thousand parachute jumps and nearly 258 – airborne landings. The aircrews
performed 507 aviation bombardment exercises and 326 live fire shootings at ground
targets. Ships and boats performed 96 artillery live-fire shootings at air targets and
110 artillery live-fire shootings toward sea targets (Annex 5).
The requirements for the timing were chosen as the main criteria for evaluating
the combat readiness of military units and formations in the Land Forces, including
relocation of military units and their materiel to the designation area, deployment at
their assigned positions, construction and use of field fortifications, security and defence
measures. The number of battalion tactical exercises in comparison to 2013 increased by
2.4 times, companies tactical training exercises by 5.5 times, platoon live fire training
exercises by 4 times. The average flight time per Army aircrew doubled. Units of High
Mobile Airborne Troops have also demonstrated high-quality professional preparation
and their combat skills.
The Air Forces provided air defence measures designed to destroy attacking enemy
aircraft and defend state facilities of vital importance against military aviation attacks
from the air. Given the practical focus of the Air Forces, the intensity of aircrew

professional training exercises has significantly increased. The number of live fire
shootings at ground targets was increased by 2.9 times and aviation bombardment
exercises by 4.5 times. However, the number of tactical flying exercises conducted by
squadrons was decreased by 3.5 times and airborne landings by 4.2 times.
The Naval Forces facilitated rapid exchange of information with Marine Guard
detachments of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine for the protection of the
territorial sea of Ukraine in countering maritime reconnaissance and sabotage groups
and unmanned aerial vehicles. During the year, almost 50 anti-sabotage military
exercises were being conducted. The total time spent by divers for underwater
exercises exceeded 1.5 thousand hours. The total number of underway operating hours
remained at the level of previous years. The naval aviation crews conducted more
than 800 special flight exercises and 50 deck-landings on the helicopter deck of the
Hetman Sahaidachnyi frigate. The total flight time in naval aviation was increased by
2.2 times.

Military authorities training

The structural units of the General Staff and other command and control structures
of the Armed Forces have made numerous improvements upon their operational
capabilities, including the planning system and provision of logistic support to
national forces. In the joint operational and strategic environment there were
conducted 69 operational training activities, the most significant of which were the
following:

  - series of staff exercises in the General Staff, Operational Commands, command
of Naval Forces, and in command and control of military units (January February 2014);

  - command post exercise with involved troops Spring Thunderstorm – 2014
(March 2014);

  - command post exercise with associated command and control structures of the
Armed Forces (May 2014);

  - command-staff war game with associated command and control structures of the
Armed Forces (December 2014).
The most significant training exercise in 2014 was a command post exercise with
involved troops Spring Thunderstorm – 2014. Its purpose was to test the real state
of combat readiness of the Armed Forces, their level of training and comprehensive
support. The representatives of State and local authorities, other military formations
and law enforcement agencies were also participating that time. All available military
training areas served for the purposes of that training exercise.
This training exercise helped to evaluate the readiness of command and control
structures and significantly improve their operational capabilities in the special period.

MULTINATIONAL
EXERCISES IN THE
GENERAL FORCES’
TRAINING SYSTEM


The final stage of training process within the Ministry
of Defence and the Armed Forces in December 2014
was the military-economic exercise Concentration –
2014, which had the following objectives:

                     - developing a clear algorithm for the coordinated
actions of the State administration bodies on the
organization and implementation of national defence
measures;

                     - determining the content, scope, performers,
procedures and deadlines for implementation of
measures to transfer the national economy, public
authorities, financial institutions, enterprises of the
military-industrial complex and the entire life-support
system of the State to functioning under the special
period conditions.
Given the scope and a list of the involved participants, it can be said that such
military-economic training exercise was conducted for the first time in the history of
Ukraine. The exercise was attended by the Ministry of Defence, the General Staff, and
the leadership of the Cabinet of Ministers, Central Executive Authorities, Council of
National Security and Defence, heads of regional State Administrations.
The conclusions of this military and economic training exercise “Concentration –
2014” were included in the documents governing the transfer of the national economy
of Ukraine to functioning under the special period conditions, territorial defence and
mobilization measures, and also fulfilment of measures foreseen by the legal regime
of martial law.

The main purpose of the Armed Forces participation in international military exercises
was the promotion of trust of the international community to Ukraine, raising the
level of security around the state borders, and ensuring the readiness of national
military units for participation in international operations on maintaining peace and
security.
In 2014, it was planned to hold 15 multinational military exercises (8 – in Ukraine,
and 7 – outside the State)[2].
Given the politico-military situation in Ukraine and around its borders, 5 exercises
involving Ukrainian units (two exercises in Ukraine and three – outside of the country)
were cancelled. Furthermore, according to the partner countries’ initiative, five
multinational exercises were also cancelled.
During the year the Armed Forces participated in five planned multinational
exercises, including 3 of them – in Ukraine, and 2 – overseas.
In addition to that, the staff officers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine took part
in 3 unscheduled command post exercises outside of Ukraine under NATO auspices
(Figure 4.1)[3].
In total, the forces involved in these training exercises included over 1,500 military
personnel (Appendix 6).

their search to the law enforcement bodies;

                    - exclusion procedures of the servicemen from the
list of the Armed Forces’ personnel military units, which were dislocated to
Autonomous Republic of Crimea and during a long period of time have been
beyond the borders of Ukraine, were specified.
2. The system of personnel management concerning mobilization conduction was
improved[4]. Conscription was determined as a separate type of military service during
the mobilization period. Besides, military service of the citizens of Ukraine, who were

army (forces).

Service in military reserve

Since the Armed Forces has transited to combat readiness 498 citizens, who serve
in military reserve have come to the military units for training exercises. They were
enlisted for the military service during the mobilization period and were assigned to
the areas of combat destination as a part of their structural units.
Organizational basis of the citizens’ service in military reserve[7] was changed in
order to strengthen reserve personnel capacity. The following order was specified:

  - training, registration, reserve personnel enlistment for the military service,
including soldiers positions;

  - reserve personnel draft for performing their duties in the military reserve and
reserve personnel draft during the mobilization period;

and subregional regimes of arms control, strengthening bilateral and multilateral
cooperation in the security field (Note 7.3).
