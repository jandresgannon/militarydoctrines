# Preface

National security is the basis on which social stability and economic prosperity are rested. During the last 2 years, with international development, the ever-changing situation between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits, and domestic political reforms, the populace is more concerned about defense affairs. We all know the fact that while defense build-up is centered on managing the armed forces, it is not only referred to military affairs. Anything that might affect national strength, such as the development of national politics, economic construction and the nourishment of fighting spirit, falls into this category. Military build-up, nevertheless, is the last resort to national security. Its success depends on the general consensus and active participation by the people as a whole.

As the National Defense Report White Paper was prepared, the Ministry of National Defense (MND) was self-motivated by the aspiration that a clearer picture of defense administration could be seen through this book by the populace. To attain this goal, preparation was made to facilitate the edition efforts.

During the process, defense experts and planners were invited to offer their advises, and opinions from the legislative bodies, news media are also included as the reference for determining the scope, structure and contents of the book. In addition, the Executive Yuan and concerned authorities also provided their guidance and remarks on the book that can be characterized as follows :
With logical thinking process, this book illustrates our 1.

national policies, guidance on defensive operations and future development. The main purpose of the National Defense

## I 1892600 1995 - 96 National Defense Report

Report is to solicit common support and active participation by the people as a whole through their understanding that defense build-up is everyone's responsibility.

2.

The content of the book is selected by people's right to know.

Defense issues that raise people's concern are included in the book, such as the utilization and management of defense properties, conscription system, military equipment procurement and military discipline. Important defense administrative matters over the past 2 years are focused on Part 3 and Part 5 without affecting the structure of the book.

3.

Attention was paid to both theory and practices, and also problem review. In stating the current situation of the Armed Forces, MND's position, views, obstacles and deficiencies in implementing defense administration are also explained. Not only can one be informed of the armed forces' status and future development, but also understand why specific measures are adopted. Defense administration is closely associated with people's rights. MND does expect people's support and encouragement, and firmly believe that our national security can be ensured only through the active participation by all countrymen. In preparing the book, appropriate consideration was made by MND.

Nevertheless, issues were discussed from MND's perspective, which might show an unobjective and conservative mindset. Any suggestions and remarks on this book, therefore, are much appreciated.

1.

The National Defense Report is designed for defense issues related to public concern over the past 2 years. It is divided into 6 parts: Military Situation, Defense Policies, Resources of Defense, The Armed Forces, Important National Defense Programming and Defense Public Affairs. The First Part - Military Situation - with regional events in U.S., Russia, European Community, Japan, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Mainland China as horizontal link , and interactions among those nations as the vertical link ,
is to explore the impact of world situations (Asia-Pacific) and future trends upon our activities.

The Second Part - Defense Policies-is to discuss current defense policies, defensive operational concept, military guidance, defense buildup and military readiness over factors related to defense policy formulation. Though narrowing in its scope, this Part is the main emphasis of the book.

The Third Part - Resources of Defense - is to explain conscription system, defense budget, military equipment procurement, the management of land belonging to the military, the development of defense technology, and other defense issues which concern the public in the context of available manpower, materials and finance associated with national defense.

The Fourth Part - The Armed Forces - is mainly to illustrate

the armed forces status, capabilities and future development.

It is revised and refined based on relevant Parts in previous national defense reports published from 1993 through 1994. In light of current situation requirements, more specific details are put on the parts of future development and military mobilization .

The Fifth Part - Important National Defense Programming –
is to describe important defense administrative matters in the last 2 years. In addition to critical defense efforts, main emphasis is put on issues related to other government departments, the civilian sector, in particular, issues related to veterans, such as the rebuilding of quarters for retired military personnel, and the compensation of retirees benefits and pensions.

Moreover, military discipline management in the field units is discussed.

The Sixth Part - Public Affairs of the Defense - is to describe MND's relations with various government agencies as well as the legislative bodies, and administrative issues connected with public's rights and privileges, such as petitions and complaints, land disputes between the military and the populace, limit on construction due to military requirement, environmental protection and civic service.

2.

"Negotiation instead of confrontation " remains to be the primary means to settle international disputes in the future.

Nevertheless, negotiation can not guarantee regional conflict would not happen anymore. There are numerous potential factors that might possibly cause armed conflicts in the Asia –
Pacific areas. The most threatening factor, among other things, is the invasion against Taiwan by the Chinese

communists. In the past, the Chinese Communists had
"quantitative" advantage. During recent years, the threat of
"qualitative" advantage has increased dramatically, especially in their long-range striking capability, which demands our close attention.

3.

Defense policies encompass the comprehensive courses of action and principles by the combination of politics , economy ,
psychology and military strength by the government to safeguard national security. Our current policies are to follow the philosophy of "integrated defense" which means the safeguarding of territorial integrity and security of Taiwan proper, and off-shore islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Wuchu, Pratas and Spratly Islands. In strategic guidance, this concept is based on "strong defensive posture " and " effective deterrence" with the objective of an "the types of troops will always be available for fighting the types of war" to the effect that the adversary is deterred from staging attacks so as the national security is assured.

The so-called "the types of troops will always be available for fighting the types of war", in its sense both materially and spiritually, is our objective and ideal of building the Armed Forces. This logical thinking begins with future forms of warfare and follows with marshaling the necessary equipment, personnel, and tactics toward victory. While defense efforts are unlimited and can not be accomplished in a day, war could break out at any given time. In the use of force, therefore, operations have to be conducted on the basis of an "fighting the kind of war with what is available". The armed forces, with their combat strength and follow - on logistical mobilization capability, should map out contingency plans and 4.

wartime programs to meet any inadvertent war.

The purpose of military deterrence, which could be defined at 2 levels, is to prevent war from breaking out. At one level, deterrence, in Chinese Communists view, means war could not be won so as not to use force. At the other, China should appreciate the cruel fact that even if they could win the war, the disastrous consequences that bear on both sides of the Taiwan Straits are beyond imagination, even their own development and survival are periled. Under such circumstance, China has to calculate more carefully the grave consequence of his options of using force against Taiwan. Furthermore, for the benefit of the future generations, China must consider the renunciation of waging attacks against Taiwan. In order to avoid high tensions and arms race triggered by misunderstanding, the Armed Forces currently strengthen its combat readiness based on defensive requirements to support the implementation of national strategy. In other words, we have to create a win-win situation.

The armed forces defensive operational guidance at this stage 5.

is to meet any contingency with unprovocative and unyielding manner. Once war breaks out, operations would be conducted based on the principle of "durable strategy" and "speedy tactics" by using all available means and full mobilization to hold every inch of the ground for final victory. The personnel available for national defense is decreasing on a yearly basis. To solve the problem, the three services are undergoing force reduction and building a crack military strength by means of appropriate manpower management as well as expansion of human resources. Main emphasis is put on 6.

7.

reserve forces training. Should the war break out, quick and full mobilization would be implemented to provide for ready forces.

8.

The total strength of the Armed Forces amounts to 460,000 ( 30,000 less compared with 1994 ), in which the Army accounts for 200,000 strong, while the Navy and the Air Force account for 60,000 each. Military Police and Coast Guard each has 20,000,and the rest is allotted in the General Staff and the Combined Service Forces. For obvious lessons learned from history of island operations and The Gulf War, ground battle is inevitable after counter-air operation and anti-blockade campaigns are concluded, and also the last resort for final success.

The defense budget of the fiscal year 1996 amounts to NT $
258,336,911,000, which accounts for 22.76% of the total government budget; a 1.75 % of decrease compared with 1995, and 3.56% of the GNP, a 0.25% of decrease compared with 1995. Military investment is programmed NT $
91,795,681,000, which accounts for 35.53% of the defense budget. Operation maintenance is programmed NT $
50,973,209,000, which accounts for 19.73% of the defense budget. NT $ 115,568,021,000 is allotted in personnel maintenance outlay, which accounts for 44. 74% of the defense budget, the highest portion of the budget due to salary adjustment on a yearly basis. The transparence rate of the defense budget is increased from 43.08% in 1992 to 63.79% in 1996.

Beginning in July 1,1990, the conscription period for eligible 9.

draftees is 2 years on a fair basis. Since then, some vacancies for military occupational specialty (MOS) are in short supply 10.

and have to be made up by MOS selection and recruit draftees for volunteer noncommissioned officers. The duration for military conscription, therefore, should not be shortened.

With regard to "social-work service" and "voluntary service",
feasibility study suggested that the armed forces must maintain adequate ready forces for contingency. Moreover, the system of an all - volunteer force should not be implemented at this stage due to limited defense funds and the potential threat imposed by the Chinese Communist.

MND has been pushing research and development of defense 11.

technology as planned. As to the procurement of military equipment, all procurement agencies among the three services have been consolidated as the Procurement Bureau under MND in July, 1995, and relevant regulations and operational procedures have been defined. Bulky procurement has to be screened and approved by the government's auditing office.

Procurement personnel are subject to the Law of "Property Claim by Civil Servants" to prevent irregularities. In order to avoid protest raised by China, military procurement projects shall not come to the light before the deals are concluded.

A strict military discipline among rank and file to prevent 12.

personal abuse has always been one of the primary efforts in defense administration. In addition to cope with personnel mismanagement and physical abuse on individual soldier, MND invited defense experts to formulate "personnel management in the field units" to be observed by the armed forces. In the future, these practices would be reviewed to determine the results in order to rationalize, normalize the personnel management practices.

"Regulations for Rebuilding Dilapidated Quarters for Military 13.

8 Dependents" have been approved by the Legislative Yuan.

MND had established a "committee for the promotion of rebuilding deteriorated quarters" to push for this program. All quarters would be rebuilt within 6 years. 15,000 - 20,000 new quarters would be constructed next year.

MND is pushing for the logislation of the regulation of service and retirement pension for officers and non - commissioned officers so as to protect servicemen's benefit. Retiress pensions will be at the same level as those of their civilian counterparts.

Those who retired after July 1,1970 can be awarded extra 15%
of their basic pay. While personnel who retired prior to June 30,1970 are not eligible for this entitlements.

MND puts high premium on the protection of fishing rights.

14 15.

For this reason, various naval ships are installed with radio sets which can communicate directly with fishing vessels. For not in the capacity as judicial police, naval direct intervention on the efforts cause disputes easily. All the navy can do is to provide information or in conjunction with coastal police in conducting random inspection and expelling trespassing.

In coordination with National Health Insurance Program, 16.

MND formulated the "Regulations for Military Dependents Accepting Medical Treatment in Military Hospitals" to protect military dependents' medical benefits. Budget is programmed yearly to subsidize dependents and civilian employees medical insurance fee. NT $ 1,148,308,087 is allotted in fiscal year 1996.

An "Anti - drug Promotion Committee" is established in field units above the division level. Also, 12 "seminars on sanitary education" were held for officers and men who have the record of drug - taking or drug trafficking. 1,581 addicts were 17. 

rehabilitated and follow-up screening procedures are conducted on a three-month basis. So far, only 53 people violated the prohibition. The successful rate for abstaining from drugs is as high as 96.7%.

A liaison office for coordinating with the National Assembly, Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan has been set up by MND. The office is also responsible for explaining important measures to the public through multiple channels such as administrative report and special subject report. To work closely with the Taiwan provincial government and other relevant institutions'" politics-military talks " and a
"coordination committee for full mobilization" synposium are held on a regular basis for coordination and communication over relevant matters.

To facilitate local development without compromising military security, MND and the Ministry of Interior have revised the stringent regulation of construction near military installments.

As of December, 1995, 3,072. 1 hectares of land are decontrolled.

In keeping with over - all government administration, MND
18 19.

has released 9 TV channels and some radio frequencies for civilian use. 9 airbases are open for co - use with civil aviation. The number of civil flights is increased by narrowing air space control and limited time control without affecting air combat readiness. Since 1995, 405 civil flights are available daily, a 33% increase in comparison with 1994.

20. 

To coordinate with governmental environmental policies, MND has mapped out out long - term and short - term environmental policies with emphasis on military hospitals, waste disposal, noise and air pollution prevention. Budget for 21. 

this purpose is programmed yearly to improve hardware and software. NT $ 464,930,000 billion has invested in the fiscal year through 1995 to 1996.

ಡ Considering the time - honored tradition of providing assistance to the civilian sector, 60,000 man-times and 410,000 man - times have been utilized in disaster relief and rice - harvest supports respectively over the past 2 years. Furthermore, 14 mobile medical teams are dispatched by MND to provide free medical services for people who live in remote areas. 20,000 plus are benefited from this program.

In the post-cold war, the world situation has been changing fast. A great deal of uncertainty exists in the world, especially in the Asian Pacific arena.

I.

Although it is the irresistible world general trend that "
negotiation is replacing the confrontation" and although some international organizations bear more binding forces upon others, it does not, nevertheless, follow that some regional conflicts will not occur.

2.

The reasons for regional conflicts are mainly due to :
Conflicts of sovereignty a.

Racial and religious conflicts b. 

Conflicts of trade and economic interest.

c. 

Ideological conflicts d. 

In the Asian Pacific region there exists some potential for armed conflict. The biggest threat comes from the growing military of the PRC, which has not ruled out the use of armed forces to invade Taiwan.

4.

5.

In the past, the PRC's threat mainly rose from the quantitative superiority, it now has also from its qualitative improvements. They pose an ever increasing capability to surprise attack Taiwan.

In recent years, the PRC has much improved her relations with Russia, Vietnam, and India by reducing the military forces along the borders. Thus they have more flexibility to 6.

launch attack in other border areas. She therefore exercises more greater impact on the balance of forces in other Asian Pacific areas.

# Worldwide General Military Situation

## I . The Fundamental Of Current International Security 1. Peace-Keeping Mission Of The United Nations

Subsequent to the end of the cold war, the world situation has changed dramtically, such as the democratization of the East European countries, the collapse of former Soviet communist system, the reunification of East and West Germany, stepping up the promotion of the policy of reform and opening of the communist China. The whole world has shifted from military confrontation to an economic-oriented competition. Both the USA and Russia are also laying emphasis on political and economic affairs, cutting significantly the defense budget, reducing troops deployed abroad, thus, turning some issues which have been formerly repressed in the former East-West contesting framework, into new struggles, such as the civil war in Bosnia, independent movement of Chechnya, the old fight between Israel and Egypt, India and Pakistan, subway explosion in Paris, as well as gas attack incident in Japanese subway by doomsday religious cult, known as Aum Shinrikyo. All of these incidents have disturbed the peace

and order of the international community. Furthermore, there exists other disputes on territories and sovereignty, rising of regional powers, proliferation of mass destruction weapons, the formation of contesting trading blocs, and environmental problems. As such, the United Nations organization is obliged to play an even more important role as a peacekeeping and peace-making force. However, the UN has not been able to function properly as a result of its inflexible structure, manpower problems, and financial crises. Facing such a challenge, Mr. Boutros-Ghali, the secretary-general of the UN in June 1995, during the 50th year of UN anniversary, declared that a reform program will be put in effect to simplify its organization and to innovate its management. While the UN can function effectively for the peace of the world has much to do with the said reform program. We can see the most urgent crisis lie in its financial difficulties which has deepened by the ever-enlarging peace keeping forces. The total strength of UN peace keeping forces now amounts to fifty-six thousand persons dispatched to various places all over the world to preform 17 different kinds of work. They cost an enormous sum of money, and it further pushes the UN into such a position that it cannot carry on its work any more. The United States of America is now having its own economic downturn and wants to reduce its assistance to the UN. We can only say that whether the UN can sustain its operation depends mainly upon whether it can secure the trust of its members, get strong support from the USA, and get the USA to pay membership dues on time.

NATO was a by-product in the early stage of the confrontation between the two former super powers. So far it has been the biggest , best organized , most efficient , and strongest military collective security organization. The member countries, both European and American, having shared somewhat common values on democracy, human rights, and legal system, have been able to keep peace and stability in Europe for more than forty years. NATO thus has set a good example of collective security to other counties in other corners of the world. In order to solve potential conflict and gain confidence among themselves, the Southeast Asian countries, held its first meeting in July 1994 in Bangkok, the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF). In August 1995 they held the second meeting in Brunei. The participating members consist of the Ministers of the seven ASEAN countries, the USA, Canada, Australia, New
· Zealand, European Union, Japan, South Korea, Russia, the PRC, Lao, Cambodia, and Papua New Guinea. The forum, a regional consultative conference on high-level political and security matters and will certainly be beneficial to the promotion of peace and stability of the region.

## 3. Arms Control And Arms Reduction

Arms control is a matter of concern for every nation. Although under of the efforts of the United Nations some major nations have already signed certain treaties on nuclear weapons, chemical and high-tech conventional weapons, nevertheless, the cost for arms reduction is also heavy; thus

it bears a heavy burden to those countries who had owned a lot of weapons, the result is not as good as expected. On April 18, 1995, a meeting participated by representatives from 178 nations was held in UN for the ( nuclear nonproliferation treaty ) . Although majority of the participating nations agreed to extend indefinitely the testing ban treaty; there were, however, Israel, India and Pakistan, among more than ten others, did not sign the ban testing treaty. The PRC and France, regardless of severe criticism and protest from many other countries of the international community, carried out nuclear testing in June and September, 1995. Therefore, progress of the arms control and nonproliferation of conventional weapons have severely been hindered as a result of conflicting opinions among the nuclear powers.

## Ii . Military Situation In America 1. Military Situation Of The U.S.A.

a.

## Global Strategy

After the end of cold war, to face a rapidly changing security environment, the United States of America has decided that global strategy is to actively take part in world affairs in order to gain strategic benefits in political, military and economic sectors as well as to continue her world leadership. The strategy can be divided into three main categories:
National Security
(1)
To face the new threat, the USA is obliged to have

adequate fighting capabilities to her needs. She has to maintain sufficient nuclear deterrent capabilities and international obligations, and to develop defensive capabilities, including theater missile defense (TMD), because of the proliferation of mass destruction weapons.

(2)
Economic Prosperity The core of the objectives of the USA's national security strategy is to promote domestic and international economic development and prosperity. As economy and security are complementary one each the other, the United States of America, in order to improve her economy, will have to integrate both civilian and military industrial sectors to step up research and development tasks.

In Support of Democracy
(3) 
As long as her national interest is not influenced, the USA would like like to to support the democratization, link-up with democratic countries, promote the concept of human rights, and urge foreign countries to open their markets under the promise that her strategic posture will not be hindered by trading issues.

## B. Military Policies

The force level planning and employment are based on the bottom-up review. The US policy is to cooperate with ally nations to ensure that she will be able to win two main regional conflicts simultaneously. The forward deployment of forces in some overseas areas

will be used to check the proliferation of large amount of mass destruction weapons, maintain peace-keeping missions, and protect national interest.

## 2. The Usa, Mexico, And Canada'S Military Situation

At the end of 1993, the USA, Canada, and Mexico had separately approved the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to be effective in January 1994. It is estimated that all custom duties and trading and investment barriers among the three countries will gradually be removed in 5 to 15 years, thus forming a free trade region from the Yukon Territory extending to Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, and their mutual defense relations will be further strengthened.

## 3. The Military Situation In Latin America

From late 1980s to early 1990s the democratization has already been going on well in Central America, South America, and Caribbean countries. Communism in various countries has already been broken up, and the alibi for abusing military power to crack down on communists is no longer existent. The Sandino regime in Nicaragua was collapsed, and El Salvador's insurgent forces came to terms with the government. In Peru, the guerrilla forces "the road to brightness " hided its diminished head. All westernphere countries have now decided to redefine their military and objectives. A pan-American summit meeting sponsored by the US was held in Miami in December 1994.

In order to maintain the security of the western hemisphere, the US, again, invited 34 defense ministers

from Central and South America countries with the exception of Cuba in July 1995 to review the overall military situations in that area, thus creating a new era for the Latin American countries. To promote the development of Central American collective security, Nicaragua, EI
Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and the Republic of Dominica held a summit meeting in Honduras and signed an agreement on democratic security in mid-December 1995, the content of which included disarmament, reduction of defense expenditure, separation of police from supervision of weapon procurement.

## Iii . The Military Situation Of Russia And The Cis

Since the establishment of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Russia had one time thought of establishing a CIS
federation forces. This concept has not been realized as a result of many complicated factors (the CIS member countries are as shown by chart 1-1). On December 9, 1992, Russia published a Defense Act limiting the total military strength to be not more than 1% of the population ( about 1. 5 million persons ). Russia also promulgated the military doctrine of the Russian federation inember 1993 declaring that no military forces are allowed to be used unless otherwise they are used for self-defense and collective security purpose. It also stated that nuclear weapons will not be used as war tools but as a deterrent force only. Russia planned to establish a rapid responsive forces of 120,000 to 150,000 persons to meet any potential crisis in the future. The total strength will reduced to 1.5 million troops by the end of this century. On December 17, 1995, Communists and extreme nationalists won in

the re-election of the Russian parliament. It remains to be seen as to what extent this result might influence the Russian. Russia's .

invasion inflicted a heavy damage on Chechnya, not remediable within a short period of time. In order to keep the integrity of her territory, it seems that the Russian government is not going to make any concessions, thus, further intensifying the issue of inddependence movement there. The potential military ability of Ukraine exercises some impact on the stability and security of the East European region. In order to reduce the concern of her neighboring countries, Ukraine now has alreaddy signed the nonproliferation treaty of nuclear forces intended to do away withall the nuclear weapons once in her possession. On June 10, 1993, Ukraine and Germany had made a joint declaration and signed a bilateral economic and political agreement. She also promised to destroy the nuclear weapons so as to facilitate the military cooperation between the two countries.

## Iv . European Military Situation

Currently European countries have become more and more interdependent in the keeping of stability. NATO therefore has decided to place military emphasis on the settlement of regional conflicts and focus on the cooperation and dialogue with former Warsaw Pact countries politically. The purpose of launching the plan of Partnership for Peace (PFP) is to promote NATOs military cooperation with Middle East and North Europe, while the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) is used as a channel of constive dialogue and cooperation between NATO and other European countries. The US will play a leading role in the NATO, and the US troops of 100,000 men and women deployed there will also be beneficial to the stability and security in Western Europe.

In 1993, in order to be able to solve regional conflicts, the Western European Union ( WEU ) founded Europe Corps, participants include France, Germany, Belgium, Spain, and Luxembourg. It has troops totalling 50, 000 personnel. In wartime, the EUROCORPS will be under the command of NATO. It is scheduled that the corps will start to join in the operation of the UN forces for humanitarian and peace-keeping tasks.

## V . Military Situation In Middle-East And Balkans 1. Middle-East

Influenced by the United States, Israel has made respective peace accords with Jordan and Palestine. In September 1995, Israelis and Palestinians concluded "The Agreement on Extending the Self-governing of Palestinian in the West Bank of Jordan River". With regards to the permanent status of the West Bank of Jordan, Gaza Corridor as well as the right of water are to be further negotiated. Despite the fact that Israeli Prime Minister Rabin was assassinated on November 4, 1995, the Israeli government's determination to seek peace remains unchanged, and the peace talks between Israel and Syria are still going on unaffected. Iraq, since its defeat in the Gulf War, has been under the UN's economic sanction. The internal instability can now be seen. The Iraqi military strength is still strong. The USA is, therefore, strengthening the security of Jordan and Saudi Arabia and keeping close watch on the movement of Saddam Hussein. Iran, which persists on the Islamic revolution, keeps on purchasing weapons and nuclear technology from the PRC, North Korea, and Russia, and remains a potential threat in the Persian Gulf area.

## 2. Balkans

Despite the fact that subsequent to the end of the cold war most countries in the Balkan Peninsula have get themselves rid of communism, nevertheless, the transformation of their economics has been difficult. They have no blue prints to follow. It is , therefore, difficult for them to attain a free market economy and obtain a fast economic growth in a short period of time. In view of the instability in Russia, Rumania, Albania, Bulgaria, and Slovenia all eagerly wanted to joined the NATPartnership for Peace plan in order to get security protection. The former Yugoslavia,

has actually collapsed after the independence of the Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, and Macedonia. There remains only Serbia and Montenegro which have combined themselves to form a federation and maintain their original names. The independence of Bosnia caused the outbreak of civil war, but a peace agreement had already been signed on December 14, 1995 by the related parties under the brokerage of the USA. NATO has sent a multi-national troop to that area for the purpose of peace keeping, and the United Nations has also decided that the arms embargo imposed on Bosnia will be eased up step by step and completely lifted in half a year.

## Vi . Military Situation In Africa

Over the past years, the independence movement in Africa not brought about more democratic political systems.

has Countries such as Rwanda, Zaire, and Somalia have been suffering from domestic turbulence and armed conflicts. With the transfer of political power, South Africa's military forces have .

reorganized, and their mission has therefore been focused on the maintenance of domestic order. Although there is little possibility of armed intervention in the regional conflict, South Africa is still influential in this area. Generally speaking, Africa's conflict and upheaval does not have much effect on the world situation. In Somalia, civil war broke out in 1991 on account of the internal struggles for the leadership by various factions in the countries.

The UN, in April of that year, tried to mediate by what is known as United Nations Operation In Somalia (UNOSOM ); in the same year, the security UN council passed a resolution to use mainly

American forces to carry on an operation known as " hope recovery" but in vain. By May 1993, the United Nations, in order to completely solve the civil war of Somalia and to protect UN
personnel, a second UNOSOM was carried out, there came the armed clashes between the guerrilla forces and the UN peacekeeping forces. There were serious casualties which caused an antiwar sentiment in America. In March, 1994, the American forces in Somalia withdrew, followed by German and Italian troops.

Thus, the UNOSOM II was ended. It is hard to perceive what might be the future of that country in spite of the fact that an agreement to terminate the war was made in March 1994. The government of Rwanda in August 1993 has signed a peace treaty with the Patriotic Front of Rwanda (PFR). The UN in October of the same year set up a support group for Rwanda (UNAMIR) to keep order and supervise the terms of the peace treaty. However, both sides of the contesting parties did not observe the treaty. In April 1994, the President of Rwanda died in an aircraft accident, and the situation further deteriorated. In early November 1995, international community severely denounced the Nigerian government for her execution of nine dissidents. As a result, the European Union imposed an arms embargo on Nigeria as a punishment on the Nigerian military government.

## Vi . The Impact Of World General Military Situation Upon The Roc On Taiwan

Since the end of the Cold War, most countries have undergone major readjustment of their military strategies. The possibility of a general war has been relatively reduced. It has also loosened the structure of the former military alliances, and sharpened

territorial disputes, arms control issues, trade conflicts, extreme racism, and the rise of religious fundamentalism. The United Nations will have to play a more important role in pursuing global peace by mediating the regional conflicts. The Pa member of the permanent Security Council, will utilize its strong position to influence the world affairs and elevate its own international position. In summing up the changes of the world situation, we might say that, except for the problems across the Taiwan Straits and in the South China Sea, the direct impact upon this country caused by incidents in other areas will not be imminent. The PRC,
however, will exploit all opportunities to expand her influence on world issues. It is therefore not favorable to us in our endeavor to extend our international survival spaces. We are facing heavier pressure and greater challenges.

# Military Situation Of The Peripheral Status In Asian Pacific Area

## I . An Overview

In the Asian Pacific, the two Koreans and the two Chinas are still challenging each other ideology with each other. In the South China Sea, disputing the ownership and sovereignty of many islands as well as the disputing boundaries of borders between India and Pakistan cannot be easily solved. Uncertainty in the region has been caused by the recent expansion of military power in Japan, China, and India (the attached chart 1-2 shows the potential conflicts in Asia-Pacific region). The conflict of Inand Pakistan will continue. The future of North Korea is hard to predict accurately. The ever increasing military capabilities to be employed in the South China Sea, the ambition to overrun Taiwan by PRC being unwilling to rule out the use of forces are making the Taiwan Straits, the Korean Peninsula, South China Sea, and South Asia a potential area for military clashes. Arms races among the nations are being caused by demise of the former Soviet forces plus the gradual reduction of UN forces in the region. Each nation tries to purchase advanced weapons to increase each defense capability.

Each nation is also very much concerned about the roles of Japan and China in the future. They only hope is that the US will keep

Chart1-2   Potential Conflicts in Asia-Pacific Region on playing a role to keep the balance of military forces in the area.

The USA's strategic and economic values are being seen as important.

## The United States Of America Ii .

The security of the Asian Pacific area has a great deal to do with the US. The economic growth of America is still the fastest in the world. It is in America 's interest to promote the development of market economies in the area by investment and trade.  Yet, since the end of the cold war, the world is facing a lot of turmoil including the Asian Pacific; there were a great deal of hardship to be solved. To name a few: possible military conflicts

among the nations, production of large numbers of destive weapons, terrorist activities, racial clashes, civil war, and drug traffic. Unless these problems are dealt with properly, the prosperity and stability of the area will be damaged. The primacy factor is how to define the proper deployment forces in the area.

On February 27, 1995, the report made by the US Defense Department, known as "Report on the Security of the Asian Pacific", states that the USA will deploy 100,000 troops over the area, of which 46,000 men and women in Japan, 39,000 men and women in South Korea. The rest will be in Hawaii, including those forces afloat in the western Pacific, for maintaining freedom of the seas as well as for the defense of the USA and Asia in order to promote peace and the interests of the USA.

## Ii . Northeast Asia 1. Japan

In recent years, Japan, influenced by the USA to share the burden of defense in the region, has greatly increased the equipment of both navy and air forces. Japan is eager to get more involved in the world affairs. She aims also to be a permanent member of the Security Council of the UN, thus elevating herself from an economic giant to a political giant. With regards to her military, she has had the most advanced naval and air force 's hardware. With the foundation of her industries, precision instnts, and technological bases, she can produce advanced military hardware in a short time. Japan's first five-year plan of defense was started in 1975. It has now been 20 years by

now. Due to the weakening threat of Russian military might, Japan is now perceiving China and North Korea as a potential threat. In 1995, Japan revealed her 5th five-year plan ( 1996-2000 ) for defense. She changes the original
"emphatic defense plan on the northern side" to an "allround defense policy" (Japan's self-defense force strength is as shown by Table 1-1 ). She cooperates closely with American forces to safeguard the Asian-Pacific region. The future of the Japanese defense policy is to share the responsibilities with USA, form a strong deterrent force, and to gain the control for safeguarding the free passages of the sea lanes of communications.

## 20 2. The Korean Peninsula

The origin of tension in the Korean Peninsula comes from the fact that the North Korea has never given up the use of forces to invade the South; the tension also comes from the North Korea's intention to develop the nuclear weapons which bring uneasiness to the USA and Japan. At present, there are only four countries-the USA, Japan, China, and Russia - which bear influence on the North Korean Peninsula, where the potential for military confrontation is still existing, especially on the fact that Southea is facing the militarily strong North Korea, which is also aiming at the developing of nuclear weapons. Because of the economic hardship in North Korea, therefore, in a foreseeable future, the breaking out of war is, however, not likely. Kim Jong II, upon the sudden death of his father, the late leader Kim II Sung in July 1994, took over the leadership of North Korea. Even though by now, he has not taken over the chairmanship of the country and the Secretary-general of the Labor Party, he has firmly controlled the North Korean internal affairs. In May 1995, the North Korea and the USA signed an agreement to build a light water nuclear reactor. That has laid down an important foundation for good relations between the two countries. It has also helped positively to create a good image for the North Korea in the international arena. (The attached Table 1-2 shows the respective force structure of South and North Korea).

## Iv . Southeast Asia

The Southeast Asia is abundant in natural resources and economically, it is growing fast with huge potential market.

Countries in Southeast areas have reached a consensus to form an ASEAN free trade area; an agreement on the establishment of the Southeast Asia nuclear-free zone has also been passed to sustain economic prosperity. After they become wealthier in time, they will have the economic basis for strengthening their defense capability, and for safeguarding their economic zones. Take Thailand as instance, she has bought a number of high-per forming military craft and a light aircraft carrier. Malaysia has bought from USA and Russia landing ships tanks, F/A-18 fighterbombers, and the MiG-29. Indonesia has bought from Germany 39 naval ships and craft. She is also planning to purchase some advanced military aircraft. Singapore has already procured E-2C,
the early warning aircraft, F-16A/B fighter-bombers from the USA; Vietnam has a fair amount of conventional forces, which are only slightly obsolescent. She has now tried to reduce her ground forces year by year in planning to have more ability and to develop some rapid deploying forces and fast reaction forces.

Vietnam has also modernized her naval and air forces. Recently, she has bought SU-27 aircraft from Russia. Even though the Philippines is still facing financial difficulties, she is, however, trying to modernize her defense by purchasing advanced weapons from the USA. The main security threat to the Southeast Asiañ nations comes from the communist China which has continuously increased her military strength and has repeatedly expressed her desire to dominate the territory in the South China Sea. What the Southeast countries are doing now is to carry out a security dialogue through the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) to exert collective influence on China. The ASEAN nations are also trying to use international pressure on China. None of the ASEAN
countries can militarily match China alone; ASEAN, therefore, has admitted Vietnam in July 1995. Before the end of the century, Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmas (Burma) will be admitted into ASEAN to increase the number of countries to ten. The purpose is to integrate the region in order to check the expansion of China.

(The status quo for armed forces strength of Southeast Asian countries is as shown by Table 1-3). In recent years, the ROC on Taiwan has been an important investor in the region; her trade and economic relations with the Southeast Asian countries have

become more closely aligned. The ROC hopes very much to develop either bilaterally or collectively, a channel for dialogue with countries in the region. In fact, the ROC is in an important strategic position, linking the western Pacific Ocean and the Southeast Asian waters. The ROC's position is important in maintaining the freedom and safety of the sea lanes of communications for security and stability of the region.

## The Situation In The South China Sea V .

The islands in the South China Sea are divided into four main groups. In Chinese language, they are called the Tungsar, the Shisar, the Middlesar, and the Nansar. They are also commonly known as the Pratas ( that is, Tungsar ), Paracel ( Shisar ), Middleshoals, and Spratly Islands (note: by the translator, different maps show different names. The maps published by the ROC's Hydrographic Office in Chinese are hereby mainly used.

For convenient sake, some conventional names are used only for ease in commutions.) The Tungsar (Pratas ) has always been occupied by the garrison personnel from the ROC; the Westsar or Paracel Groups are now being controlled by the PRC. The Nansar, or the Spratly Islands, is a different island occupied by the ROC, the PRC, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia (
The Middlesar consists of some shoals, of which some are inhabitable and underwater in low tide). It is the Nanshar Group
(the Spratly Islands) which is being disputed because of political, military, and economic interests. In a number of informal seminars, even though many participants from many countries concerned agreed to shelve the dispute for the time being, and to solve the problems by peaceful means, however, nobody appears willing to concede the issue of sovereignty. The dispute has become even more complex because some countries are building and strengthening military construction works on some of the islands, and have signed contracts with some international petroleum companies for oil exploration (Chart 1-3 shows the current situation of the South China Sea). It has been agreed by the coastal states to shelve disputes, to develop the resources together

for common uses "if the work of putting up marking stones on the island and to patrol in forces have in fact been carried out by the parties concerned". The PRC and the Philippines have, however, come to terms on 10 August, 1995 by announcing that they would not use military to resolve disputes. The disputes will have to be solved by international laws. All agreed to the principle of freedom of passage; this, however, does not mean that the PRC
has given up their claims of sovereignty. Eventually, when the PRC has completed their military modernization program, and they have the military capabilities to defend the entire area of the South China Sea, they might be more aggressive than now.

This government in Taiwan has also always claimed that the territorial right belongs to the ROC. She has stationed troops on the Tungshar (Pratas) and Itu Aba Island of Nanshar (Spratly).

Islands for peaceful purposes: such as weather data collection purposes, and always advocated the principle of nonviolent method for solving any disputes. The ROC only hopes to carry out dialogues with all the lateral states in confidence building measures, in maintaining the safety of sea lane communications as well as the free passage of air traffic in order to promote the general peace and stability of the region.

## Vi . The Impact Of Asian-Pacific Military Situation Upon The Roc On Taiwan

To sum up the afore-mentioned military situation in the Asian Pacific Region, we can see that it is economic cooperation and conflicts which are most conspicuous. Apart from the economic issues, the remaining conflicts come from the disputes between India and Pakistan and also between North and South Korea. It also comes from disputes in the South China Sea, as well as the potential use of force to invade Taiwan. Among all these possibilities, the impact of India-Pakistan conflict, and that of North and South Korean conflict will not be great upon Taiwan. The disputes in the South China Sea are also of low impact on Taiwan. As far as Taiwan is concerned, the most greatest danger would come from an invasion by the armed forces of the PRC.

# Military Situation In The Mainland China

## I . Strategic Environment

In the recent years, after the collapse of the former Soviet Union, the forty years or so confrontations between the democratic and communist blocs have finally come to an end. But the strategic situation surrounding China has drastically changed.

## 1. The Usa

In the 1950s and 1960s, during the Korean and Vietnam campaigns, the USA and China have come to head-to-head arms collision course. But, since the 1980s, the former opposing countries have eased their confrontation and managed to work together to counter the former Soviet Union. In recent years, with the collapse of the Soviet, the PRC, on account of the demand of reform, has kept close relations with the USA. However, the PRC has noticed the change in the USA's strategy and feels that the USA is to prevent the PRC from entering the GATT. That has deteriorated good relations.

## 2. Russia

The serious confrontation between the PRC and the former

Soviet Union has now also eased due to the collapse of the Soviet Union. Even though, Russia still has significant military strength, and her nuclear capabilities are less capable compared with that of the USA. , nevertheless, the Russian government, under internal political and economic pressure, has lost the will to expand externally. The PRC, therefore, is now adopting the following three strategies designed for economic development and military modernization :
To increase trade between the PRC and Russia a.

b.

To exchange consumer goods made by the PRC military production lines, and exchange for Russian military euipment. especially advanced tanks, aircraft, and submarines; c.

To step up the exchange visits and cooperation between the two militaries. They have also signed treaties which might be considered as non-aggression treaties.

## 3. Japan

As the political vacuum has formed because of the withdrawing of the former Soviet Union and US forces from Asian Pacific, Japan has now become the PRC's main rival.

The history of Japanese aggression against China has not totally been forgotten. They now are facing each other with growing military strength. The PRC, however, is simultaneously trying to develop her economy and improve her relations with Japan. On account of the Japanese proposed economic aid, the PRC has temporarily put aside the sovereignty issue of Senkaku Island, and also the war damage compensation. They have been very cautious on

these issues during the high-level visits of the two countries, and often do not even mention these issues at all. Right now, because of the mutual dependency, the relationship has come closer. On August 29, 1995, Japan, however, wanted to freeze some loans to protest against Chinese continued nuclear testing. The PRC also responded strongly and accused Japan of intervening her internal affairs. Japan was also accused of having political motives. But, from a long term view and the common interest of the two countries, they have try to dilute the current conflicts as much as possible.

## 4. The Korean Peninsula

North Korea and communist China are the only two communist countries which are similar to each other after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Kim Jong II, has not quite consolidated his power as he is only a new ruler. The PRC 
at this moment seems to be in a right position to support Kim, but China only does that on a limited basis. The PRC
gave North Korea only limited political and economic support and tries to control North Korea in other respects.

This is a contradictory policy. In 1950s, Southa was a victim of the PRC, because of the PRC's intervention in the Korean Campaign. South Korea still has some lingering hate against the PRC. But now she wants to use the PRC as a counterweight against the North; and the PRC also wants to obtain economic aid from South Korea. The two countries therefore established diplomatic relationship in 1992.

## 5. Southeast Asian Countries

In order to balance the pressure of the ASEAN , China tries to be friendly to the four countries in the Indo-China Peninsula. China has launched an integrated political, economic, military and diplomatic offensive in attempts to improve relations with Vietnam, Lao, Myanmas (Burma)
and Cambodia; and also wants to use the four countries as a buffer between China and the ASEAN. Mr. Jiang Zeming made a visit to Vietnam in 1994, but he did not quite achieve the objective of solving the South China Sea problem. He had eased the conflict by proposing more frequent exchanges of visits and more trade and economic cooperation. The cooperation with Indo-China countries will also include the economy of the PRC's southwestern provinces. Building better road network from southwestern parts of China to Burma and Lao has also the strategic significance of enabling China to have easier access to the Pacific and Indian Oceans.

## 6. India

China and India had gone to war before, and now, both countries are still posting troops along the China-Tibet-India borders. The Dalai Lama's government in exile has been under the protection of India. This has creating instability in Tibet, and the Chinese government is very unhappy about this. India has a fairly significant military capability, especially her naval forces. But, India has not have done too much towards the east because of her own domestic political troubles. The PRC and Burma's relations are 32 getting better, and PRC is said to have used some of the Burmese islands as stepping stones to enter the Indian Ocean. This has alerted India which is taking measures to show her willingness to work together with ASEAN for the common interest of keeping the regional stability.

## Ii . Reform And Opening

Since the launching of PRC's policy of "reform and opening", they have concentrated the modernization of her economy. But, at the same time, they also want to modernize her military; therefore, they have had to accommodate the two objectives. Sine 1990, the defense budget had been increased while they also increased the arms sales to earn foreign currency. The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) is also involved with the manufacturing industries, commercial trade, and the shifting of military production lines into civilian production as well as getting involved with civil constructions to catch the "reform and opening train". The armed forces are thus shifting from "support the military by military " policy to "strengthen the military by military" policy. In short, the military has to make money by herself. The side effects of this change are low morale in the armed forces and unwillingness to join the military services. The profit made by the individual businessmen, the private enterprises, and plus the 15% or so inflation are making the pay t increase of the military which amounts to only about 10% sum small, therefore causing the leaving of military personnel from the military services. It is now a circulating thought among the military services "take off the uniform, run for the small wealth".

If one is in the military service, one should perform the job which

would be useful when one retires. To sum up what has been said previously, we might say that it is the common wish of the people in mainland China to see steady progress of the "reform and opening" policy. Whether it would succeed or not, depends upon the political wisdom of the current leadership of Jian-Lee. The PLA will exert more influence internally and externally. Because of this, the leaders in the military commission possess the real power. It will also help increase the power and position of the PLA. The PLA from now on will play a more influential role within the communist China and in the international community, and will therefore have an effect on the strengthening of its political power and the stability of the world situation. Under "the party leads the military" system, the PLA will make progress toward modernization both in quantity and quality.

## Ii . Military  Development 1. Adjusting The Strategic Concept

The PRC after assessing the situation inside and outside of the country, has adjusted its deployment from the three norths to the four seas. Three norths refer to the northeast China (Manchuria), north China, and northwestern China, while the four seas mean the North China Sea, Bohai Sea, East China Sea, and the South China Sea. They held an Enlarged Military Commission Conference in January 1993 to readjust its deployment, moving their troops in three fronts, that is: the southeast coastal front, south China front, and the China-India border front. It has been more than a decade since Deng Xiaoping started to modernize

PLA in 1978 with the program of innovating the military equipment, improving the rules and regulations of the armed forces, and emphasizing research and development, as well as maintaining the revolutionary political ideology.

After the Persian Gulf War, PLA has placed emphasis on both quantity and quality for "fighting and winning the wars under the modern technological conditions", aiming at to match with advanced countries in nuclear and aeronauticalouter space war in what they call the upper-level forces. In the middle level, they aim at catching up the new types of naval ships, aircraft and artilleries, in whatever changes presented to them. In the lower level (the conventional combat troops) they want to narrow the gap between the advanced countries and theirs.

## 2. Increases In The Defense Budget

The Financial Minister of the PRC, Liu Zhongli on March 6, 1995, in the third session of the eighth People's Congress, announced that the defense budget of 1995 amounts to 63,097 million RMBs, defense budget of 1994 amounted to 55,071 million RMBs. To compare the two, the increase was 14.59%, with the defense budget only 9.92% of the total financial budget. To compare the defense budget of five years ago (1991) which was 33,029 million, the increase was about double (see Table 1-4). The logistic command in the PRC Ministry of Defense is charged with the responsibility of formulating the defense budget. The itemized budget has never been published. Based on some other known material, the budget can be divided into six main categories. To state briefly, it consists of the

personnel and living expenses, procurement of the weapons and other equipment, education and training, care and maintenance, R&D, and others.In fact, the defense budget as announced by PRC does not reflect the whole budget, the said scanty 63 billion fund for maintaining the personnel and living of the 3 million troops and administrative uses would not be sufficient, because, according to them: "First to maintain the living, second to maintain the hardware, and then to take care others". They will then have no funds left to operate and renew weapons. We can safely say that a great portion of the budget is hidden in non-military categories, which are under the scientific works, aeronautical and space companies, general companies for aviation, shipping industries, ordnance industrial companies and electronic companies. They also hide their expenditures in non-military line items, such as basic construction that contains a great deal of military purpose construction, and civil defense are included in the municipal funds, science studies and expenditures, for the military schools. Material and equipment for military establishment can also be included in the general funds for civilian education, scientific studies and public hygienic funds, for expanding the sources of funds which the military service use can also come from the military production of public commodities, reinvestment of military funds to the civilian organization; such as the Northern Industrial Company, Great-Wall Industrial Company, or the Xin-xing Company. These defense-related companies are engaged in the production and sale of arms. According to some estimates, the hidden portion of defense budget is over 130 billion

## 36 Military Situation

(130,000,000,000) RMBs. On the top of their published figure of 63,097 million (63,097,000,000) RMBs, the PRC defense budget may well exceed 200 billion
(200,000,000,000) RMBs.

## 3. Expediting The Renewal Of Weapon System

The PLA adopts a principle of "scientific studies go first, quantity and quality have the priority". They also observe three points :
More effort on how to manufacture it and learn more a.

about technology; Produce a small amount in the beginning.

b.

High

c.

performing weapons go to only some selected units; Modernize the troops echelon by echelon, gradually take out the gap with the advanced countries. In the recent years, PLA has made progress both in the conventional and strategic weapons. The Army manufactures (90 II) tanks, automatic command system and intensified anti-air system as well as the development of "M-9 missiles system"; the Navy has completed the "Lu-Hu Class Missile Destroyer", "Jiang- Wei and Jiang-Hu Destroyer Escort ", "Type 039 Submarine", as their second generation naval ships.

They also completed the anti-ship C-802 missiles. The program of aircraft carrier is progressing. The Air Force has completed the construction of "H-6" type modified air tanker for flight test, "Fighter-bomber, J-
7", and multiple purpose air-to-ground /sea surface missile firing test. With regard to the imported weapon system and technology, PRC has bought from Russia 26
× SU-27, and four Kilo class submarines. There is a second batch of buying for SU-27s, T-80U tanks, "Kilo class" submarines, and a technical package for the production of MIG-31. For strategic weapons, Dongfeng 31 (CSS-X ) and Ju-lang or Big Swell Mark II (CSS-
N-X), SLBM has come to this phase for trial. D-F 11
(M-11) and D-F 15 (M-9) missiles have been formally positioned in the military.

## Iv . Current Situation Of The Pla 88 1. Current Strength Of The Pla

The PLA personnel come from both the voluntary and conscript sources. Volunteers is the main source. Those personnel who serve in the PLA are known to be in active service. Those who serve in the militia or registered to be in the reserve are now to be in the reserve forces. It is a system composed of the active and reserve soldiers. The volunteer enlisted men serve three years in the Army, four years in the Navy and Air Force. After completing the length of service, the enlisted men can ask, according to his own desire and the military vacancies, to prolong their service. For the army, it can be prolonged 1-2 years, for the navy and the air force, only 1 year. After extended service, the servicemen can be converted into volunteer service for at least 8 more years. The longest length of service cannot exceed 12 years. According to the PRC's law of the military service, the PLA is composed of 3 elements, namely; "the PLA", "People's Armed Police", and "the Reserve Forces".

The PLA is comprised of four services: Army, Navy, Air Force, and the strategic missile force ( the Second Artillery). The active service has 3 million persons, armed police 950,000 plus persons, and the reserve forces 1 million persons. The total strength amounts to 4,950,000 persons.

Army a.

The present manpower of army is about 2,000,000, which are deployed in seven military zones, consisting of 24 armies (or army-groups) which is organized in about 80 infantry divisions, 20 armor divisions
(brigades), 30 artillery divisions (brigades) and other

battle support and logistic support units. Main equipment:
Armor vehicles: some 14,000 of which the main Battle tanks: 59-II tanks, type 69 tanks. The artillery: tow guns 15,000 pieces. Multiple-barrel rackets 3,800, self-propelled guns 1000. Short-range M
series missiles have undergone trials and will be deployed in Lo-ping, Jiang-xi Province.

Navy:
Manpower:400,000 plus (including the coastal defense force, marine and naval aviation). Organization: North Sea Fleet, East Sea Fleet, South Sea Fleet, Submarine Command, Coast Guard, Naval Aviation Command.

Equipment:Some 100 submarines: Hsia Class, some 100 SSBN and Han Class SSN.

Surface: 50 surface combatant ships, 240 plus attack missile ships, 60 amphibious ships, 2,000 auxiliary and miscellaneous vessels Marine:One brigade Naval Aviation Some 700 aircraft (H-6 × 10 odd; H-5
×60 odd; J-5 ×40 odd; J-6, J-7, J-8×500 odd.

Air Force Manpower: Some 400, 000 (including anti-air and paratroops).

Organization:Some forty combat divisions (regiments)
consisting of mainly 4, 000 J-types fighters and bombers, 300 bombers (some are nuclear capable), 400 transport, some 100 helicopters, totally some 4,800 aircraft. The air force includes one corps of airborne b. c. troops.

d .

The Second Artilleries (Strategic Missile Forces)
Manpower:Some 120,000 at bases in army corps level Equipment :Some 100 of DF5 ICBM, DF-4 ICBM, DF-3 ICBM. PLA Air Force might have also developed mobile medium-range missiles.

## 2. Deployment

Deployment of the PLA is done by their "active defensive strategy concept", based on the geopolitical position and assumed aggressors, they divide the whole country into north, southeast, and southwest fronts as well as seven military zones. In each zone, they have Navy, Air Force, and the Second Artillery to form an integrated "theater strategy".

a.

Ground Forces The three military zones in northern China
(Shenyiang, Beijing, Lanzhou) is positioned to watch Russia, and at the same time to act as a whole national strategic reserve. It has about more than one million men of crack troops. In the southeastern region (the Nanjing region), it is aiming at Taiwan with about 340, 000 men. In the southwestern zone (Guangzhou and Chengdu zones), it is for watching the Vietnam and India, with 430,000 men. The central area (the whole of Jinan military zone) the strategic reserve forces are being kept with about 260,000 men.

Navy b.

The North Sea fleet is charged with the defending of the Yellow Sea and Bohai Bay with major bases in

Lushun, Dalian, Yantai, Qingdao. These fleets have about 900 plus ships, of which the bigger combatant ships and submarines form the main body. The East Sea fleet is responsible for East China Sea and Taiwan Strait areas with major bases in Shanghai, Dinghai, Fuzhou. It has about 900 plus ships, of which a great portion are fast attack craft. The South China Sea fleet, responsible for South China Sea, including the Paracel and Spratly Isles, with major bases in Guangzhou, Zhanjiang, Yulin (in Hainan). The fleet has about 700 ships, of which mainly are of amphibious types.

Air Force c.

The concept of deployment is to defend the Beijing .

capital area against the Russian from the north; and to face Taiwan in the southeast. Next comes the southwest for watching the Vietnam. Along the China-India border, due to the lack of sufficient air bases, only small portion of air forces are being deployed. They will reinforce the forces from Interior when necessary.

In the north, the three military zones, Shenyang, Beijing and Lanzhou have the main base complex with a total force of 2, 000 aircraft, as the main body, supported by the 700 aircraft deployed to Jinan Military Region serving as strategic reserve forces, among them J-7, J-8 and A-5 (modified MiG-19) are stationed there.

In the southwest China, some 1,200 aircraft deployed to Chengdu and Guangzhou are used to panzer movement against Vietnam, of which the better types of J-7 serves as forward positioning forces. Regarding

deployments against Taiwan, the PRC naval aviation and air forces are adopting a kind of "less forces in the front and more forces in mobile" to form a flexible force. Some 1, 000 aircraft deployed to Nanjing Military Region serve as main body, coupled with
"Emergency Mobile Force" serving as strategic reserve force. At these bases J-7 are replacing the older J-6 to reinforce the combat capability of "southeast coastal areas" and "South China Sea". The 26 × SU-27 are now based at Wu Hu in Anhui Province. SU-27 has a maximum speed of 2.35 mach, and a radius of operation of 1,500 kilometers. The Second Artillery d.

The GHQs is situated in Beijing. The strategic disposition of the missile forces has been re-diverted from concentrating at former Soviet Russia. China currently has shifted its missile forces aiming at America with only a portion targeting the original Russian targets, and a portion of the medium-range missiles at the US forces stationing in Asia as well as targeting at US allies in Asia. Taiwan is well within the ranges of these missiles.

## V . The Hidden Flaws And Problems Of The Pla 1. The Twelve Hidden Flaws

In a special speech delivered by Zhang Zhen, then, the cochairman of Military Commission in 1995, at the PRC
Defense University, he pointed out that there are twelve

hidden flaws in the PLA as follows .

Long under the condition of "negotiation", PLA cadres a.

are not combat-ready-minded. They have become a bit slacken.

A need to reemphasize and reclarify in order to b.

understand American hegemonism after the end of cold war; and also to understand the threat and challenge of the politics, military, and economy of American power politics.

c.

The awareness that anti-Communist international forces are weak. These anti-Communists are working to subvert, sabotage, infiltrate, and to overthrow the Chinese socialist institution. Party organization in each level of the PLA shows weakness in the indoctrination and leading of the political thought of the PLA.

d.

The good traditional, hard struggling spirit of the PLA
is gradually disappearing.

e.

f.

It is a big problem now with regard to traditional honor, sense of the era, sense of duty, and purpose of joining the military service.

Willingness to join the Party, and ambition to move upward and the whole political atmosphere are weak in the advanced military university. The no-good social attitude, the ideal of bourgeois class and the sense of anarchy are growing and spreading in the PLA.

g.

h.

The motive to become an officer is generally wrong.

i.

Some officers want to use the services in the PLA as stepping stone to find a good job when they leave the service.

j.

Cases of disobedience, reluctance to carry out orders have frequently occurred.

k.

l.

Cases against the laws and regulations: Some sudden occurrence of bad incidents has happened frequently.

The PLA has invaded and unlawfully used the people's property against people's interest. It has direct impact on the relations between the PLA and lol government between the PLA and the people. The said report has strongly pointed out the fact that the flaws and defects of the PLA have come from the corruption of the officials of the Party and Administration in the high echelon. All these hidden defects are indeed serious.

## 2. Some Other Problems

a.

Ideological and Political Thought While the markets are shifting from a centralized economy to free market, because individual businessmen and private enterprises are booming, military officers and men are under the temptation of money, under the psychology of "looking forward to seeing the money ", they throw themselves to the market of commodities for making money. It influences first the military education and training. The case of military men acting against the laws and regulations are increasing. Even though the military leadership has repeatedly demanded the officers and men to pay more attention to discipline, nevertheless, some officers and men are tempted by the change of society, economic prosperity, and thought "it is a loss

to be in the military service", do not want to comply with the political world of urging them to be keen with their military duties while the GHQs are trying the political indoctrination work to solve the serious problems of the demotivation of the officers and men.

Engaging in Commercial Business by the Military Men Since 1994, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has taken back the right to engage in commercial business by units lower than at the corps level. But, it did not work, simply because doing business is one of the way to gain foreign currency which makes up a portion of the insufficient defense budget. Also some portion of the middle echelon of servicemen have already left the military to do business. It also lowered down the quality standard of the military service which finds it hard to maintain a good elite for building up a high-quality PLA.

Management of Production The PLA is intensifying its production for commercial b.

C.

gain, earning profit for making up the insufficiency of the military budget. It also thus comes into conflict with the civilian enterprises. In June 1995, they call on a seminar of " Strengthening the Management of Military Production". It was learnedthat at the present, there are many guiding and operating departments of the production work have knocked down their jobs of straightening out and tightening control the companies under their supervisions. They allow inefficient production go on, especially in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and in special coastal districts. They need special
, 2

## Military Situation

improvement and better control; the dividing of dividend return between the different levels of management has made their relationship very subtle. It does need effective improvement and control.

## D. Pay Structure

In recent years due to the economic reform and coming on the scene of individual businessmen, the gap between the earning soldiers and that of the people had been widened inversely. That is, the people are making more and more, while the soldiers less and less. The military pay scale has been adjusted each year, but due to inflation, the living standard of the troops are hard to raise. Minister of Logistic Command, during an extended conference of the military commission, flatly confessed that "the widening pay gap between soldiers and people cannot be overlooked, it has impact on the willingness of soldiers to serve and impact on the stability of the military services". Laws and Discipline of the PLA
e.

Deputy company leader, 1st Lieutenant Tian Mingjian of the garrison division of the Beijing garrison district, stationing in Tong Xian, on 20 September, 1994 deserted the army carrying rifles with him, shot and killed passengers on the street from the city gate
"Jianguo Men", caused 70 casualities. The incident disclosed the fact that the PLA, was influenced by the fact of reform and opening which, in turn caused the problems of discipline. The statistics of the first half of 1994 released by the PRC showed there were some 420 cases of major offenses of which, 32 cases were arm

robberies and killing. They were said to be due to the fact that the management were not firm, training in the safe keeping of ammunition were not strict enough, and the alertness of the key cadres were low as well as the security measures must have some defects. The PLA,
therefore, wants all the units to step up the disciplinary actions to observe more straightly the orders from the Central Commission in order to prevent the serious cases of offenses from happening.

## Vi . Military Training And Exercise

1.

The PLA is actively learning American and Russia theories of " air-ground integrated operation " and " vertical operations in great depth". The PLA, except strengthening their synthetic or joint training between the Army, Navy and Air Force, and between the different branches of the single service, are emphasizing coordination between the air and ground elements, thus they are therefore greatly improving their assault ability of the fast maneuvering army and deep penetrating abilities for their groundrces. The PLA sets the year 2000 as an important milestone of their building of military forces which are aiming at acquiring the capability of meeting the sudden, rapid, and highly technological localized warfare, such as the border clashes.

They also point out "the development of theater strategy" and define the theater as the principal scope of a campaign.

Whereas each military zone in each year would conduct a joint military exercise to strengthen the vertical, synthetic, long-distance mobile, command ability of its key cadres,

![77_image_0.png](77_image_0.png)

they also have observed the experience and lessons of the Persian Gulf War, to put the new technologies and military actions together as the basis of training. They have especially said that training is aiming at assuming the American forces as main adversaries, making it more difficult to fight, by doing so, Taiwan don't have to be mentioned too much.

## 2. Characteristics

a.

Purposes of Exercises Are Well Presumed The PLA think that "The classification of secrecy is also decided by the necessity of the political needs". All their maneuvering and training have been done according to the specially assumed adversary of each military zone and respectively assigned missions. Take the case of Hongkong negotiation, for instance, when the negotiation got stuck at one time, they put on a
"Guangzhou Military Zone Exercise". Right after the exercise, Deng Xiaoping published the speech, "the Fundamental Stand of the Problems of Hongkong" in which, Deng said "If there arises any serious chaos in Hongkong, the PRC will be compelled to change the time and ways of taking back Hongkong". It has also been obvious that when Taiwan held any important election, the PLA would conduct some sort of military exercise facing Taiwan, or stepping up their degree of combat readiness. In 1995, when President Lee Denghui visited USA and Premier Lian visited Europe, the PLA put on a serious missile testing fire and conducted Army, Naval, and Air Force joint exercises

in nearby water of Pengchia Yu, the coasts off Keelung, Kaohsiung and Southeast coastal area. Though they were claimed merely routine exercises, they were designed to intimidate Taiwan and express the intention to invade.

b.

Stressing of the Airborne Operation They also expedite the operations of airborne and paratroops which can be said to be examples set by the advanced countries which conducted the "high vertical envelopment and deep penetrating operations". The PLA is now using regimental size of airborne troops with well-balanced complement of eight elements, namely the path-finders, high-tech reconnaissance, infantry, artilleries, signaling, engineering, ordnance, chemical and aviations. It is a well composition of highly-specialized professional forces. They had conducted some related exercises, employing them in guerrilla warfare zone as well as in the peripheral of targeted air fields.

Joint Exercise of Army, Navy, and Air Force с.

The PLA has advanced their exercises from that of each individual force to joint operation with all branches of the services. Since September 1993, the exercise of large military zone, set at Guangzhou, they have now shown the trend of bigger scale joint operation with Army, Navy, and Air Force. Strengthen the Capabilities of Electronic Warfare In recent years, the electronic warfare has also become an important ingredient. The PLA have absorbed a great deal of experience from the more advanced d .

![79_image_0.png](79_image_0.png)

countries. Many times they demonstrated the abilities in electronic warfare. They also pay attention to blockade warfare and night actions. All these constitute a great threat in the defense of Taiwan. Undoubtedly, it needs our great attention.

e.

Long-distance Mobile Warfare According to the directives of the Central Military Commission, the PLA should be able to fight at any time without having to go through any pre-war exercise. They conduct that from time to time by demonstrating this in a fast maneuvering over the land, railway, water, and air transport to exercise this maneuvering warfare with no pre-war exercise. Over the past few years, the PRC has purchased more SU-27 aircraft fighters, increased the load of IL-76, replaced about 280 old battle ships, revamped the Jing-jiu Railroad, coastal airports, and harbors, as well as finished the construction of the Paracel Yong-xing air base. As a result, the PRC's long-distance maneuvering capability has been greatly improved.

## 3. Conclusion

To sum up the afore-mentioned PLA training, the PLA has made great progress on the maneuvering capabilities of their army and on the amphibious warfare capabilities.  The Navy has developed the blue water fighting capabilities. The Air Force has acquired a long-distant operation capability as well as in coordination with other service in joint operation. The Second Artillery has improved their fighting capabilities. The civil air transport can also support military

operations. They have much improved in the synthetic or joint operations. All these demand our utmost attention and preparation to meet them.

## Vi . The Impact Of The Pla'S Development Upon This Country

Right at this moment, the PRC exploits the interaction across the Taiwan Straits to expedite the realization of their "one nation, two systems". But, at the same time, they speed up their military modernization to prepare the use of forces to counter Taiwan. Relatively speaking, the PLA is larger than Taiwan's defense force in quantity; now they also are good in quality, which enables them to attack Taiwan from the air. The ROC government 's efforts in bringing about cross-strait reconciliation has hitherto received no affirmative response from the PRC. Instead , the PRC
conducted military maneuvers of simulated attack on Taiwan. As a protest against the ROC's pragmatic diplomacy and with a view to squeezing the ROC out of the international arena, the PRC also launched missile test fire and joint military maneuvers off the coast of northern and southern Taiwan as well as along the southeast coast of mainland China. The PRC's military intimidation and diplomatic isolation not only gives rise to strong aversion of the people of the ROC towards the other side of the strait and has an adverse effect on cross-strait interactions, but also poses a great threat to the ROC's security. Facing this grave situation, the ROC
government, in consideration of regional peace and stability, still remains rational and continues appealing to the PRC authorities for the restoration of peaceful consultation and the defuse of tense situation. Nevertheless, the PRC remains adamant in its attempt

![81_image_0.png](81_image_0.png)

to disrupt the ROC's domestic solidarity, influence the ROC's political direction, and shake the morale of its people by using the slogans of "one country, two governments ", " economic investment", and "direct links". After the end of cold war, the PRC has really no significant enemies. But, they paradoxically are increasing their defense budget and armed forces. The PRC is aiming first at overwhelming the ROC, and they are also aiming to fill the vacuum in Asian Pacific. They have improved the relations with Russia, Vietnam, India. They reduced the border troops with the former hostile neighboring countries. They are now in superior position to overcome Taiwan. The Asian-Pacific regions are actually facing a bigger impact.

4.

The current directives of the defense policy for the Armed Forces are based on " strong defensive posture " and
"effective deterrence". Basing on the directives, the necessary the Armed Forces are to be established. In fighting the war, the defense operational guidances are to rely on the control of the air, control of the sea and counter-landing operations. To use the joint and unifying total capabilities for protecting the nation, the lives and properties of the people.

The building up of the Armed Forces are aiming at the goal 5.

2.

of "the types of troops will always be available, for fighting the types of war". Aiming at this goal, the building up process can be divided into several phases or years. It has also aimed at preventing the enemies from starting the war easily. The Armed Forces, in reality, are ready "to fight the kind of war with what is available". Each year, the Armed Forces have a "rolling plan" to modify the annual combat readiness-plan, and mobilization plan for meeting any contingency which may occur.

6.

The military´s present defense strategy is based on the attitude of "no provocation, no evasion" in dealing with any possible military crisis. To effectively deter enemys attack, the methods of "durable strategy" and "speedy tactics" are used in the employment of military forces for fighting enemies.

The combat readiness of the ROC's military is based on the reinforcement of "basic readiness for operation", "readiness for crises", and "readiness for war" with emphasis on the education of the entire people on national defense, implementation of wartime mobilization, improvement of military training and maneuvers, as well as the elevation of general combat capability.

# The Meaning Of Defense Policy And The Related Factors For Formulating The Policy

## 1. The Meaning Of Defense Policy

National defense is to defend the integrity of national territory, sovereignty, and her people. In doing so, a nation has to prepare for war, to take action for "keeping peace internally, and repelling aggression externally" in order to safeguard its security. Policy refers to those general directives and action lines, adopted by the government for the said purpose. In short, defense policies are those general lines of actions and directives taken by the government for the sake of defending the nation.

To accomplish the national objectives, the government integrates the total national powers (briefly known as the national powers) which comprise the political, economic, psychological and military powers. The policies made in the highest national level and authorities by an established process are known as the national policy which is also the defense policy in its broader sense.

## 2.

Factors Bearing on the Formulating of Defense Policy

## 1996 National Defense Report 58 National Interests A. National Objectives B.

They are the affairs greatly concerned by the nation for the survival and development of the people. At the present stage, the national interest of the ROC should include the following:
National security must be surely preserved.

(1)
Social stability and economic prosperity must be
(2)
maintained.

Fundamentally the national objectives are the political advocation of the nation. A nation in her developing of the national interests may have her ultimate and provisional national objectives "specially set for a certain period".

The Ultimate National Objectives
(1)
Chinese as a race has a long glorious surviving history over five thousand years. She has been a peace-loving people. People are always considered to be the foundation of the nation. Since the overthrowing of the last Manchu Emperor, led by the founding father Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution in 1912. The ROC has always aimed to attain the ideal of the Three People's Principles, or in other words, to attain the ideal of freedom, democracy, and equal wealth for the people of the nation. These ultimate objectives will never be changed.

National Objectives in This Present Stage 
(2)
The nation is currently divided and under separated jurisdictions. The ROC government in May 1991 abolished the "Temporary Law of Mobilization and
્ર ત્
ಿ
Suppression of the National Rebellion" and declared
"not to use force for achieving the goal of the unification of the nation". The ROC, therefore in this stage of development sets the following as her current objectives :
"To use the peaceful and democratic means for the unification of China" will not be changed because currently the whole country is divided and under separate jurisdictional controls.

(a) 
For attaining this objective, the defending of
(b)
Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu and other islands as well as the enlarging of survival and developing the international spaces are of primary important objectives.

Threats to National Security In carrying out her "keeping peace inside, repelling aggression from outside" policy, the ROC is facing the following threats:
Potential military invasion by forces from the PRC.

(1)
(2)
Secession of the national territory.

c.

Regional conflicts: In fact, the biggest, the most
(3)
direct and most serious threat is the PRC's invasion capability. It is, therefore, the most urgent work in national defense to prevent it from happening.

Building up the Defensive Forces-the Military Strategic Plan of the ROC Armed Forces Meaning
(1) 
d.

The national defense forces consist of the military and the civil defense. Armed Forces are the nucleus and the military strategy is to study and design how

to build up the forces in order to create/exploit the favorable strategic situation in support of the national strategy in order to maximize the probabilities of success, and the most favorable consequence in the pursuing of military objectives.

It includes:
(a) The concept for the ROC Armed Forces buildup;
(b)
The force restructuring plan of the ROC Armed Forces;
(c)
The combat readiness plan for the ROC Armed Forces.

## (2) Purpose

There must be a well-established system to coordinate the planning of all the military work, enabling the building up of forces, the development, the operational planning, etc. to meet the readiness for war.

Set up the Procedures
(3)
್
ਨੂੰ
Assess the changes in the world situation, and develop strategy for science and technology, and a plan of weapons development. Estimate the enemys general situation and threat as well as our own capabilities to fight the war. Based on a rational judgment of imagining the type of war that we will be engaged, formulate our own strategic concept, and to think about what kind of armed forces we have to build up. Lay out the concept of building up the necessary forces. As a result, the plans that form the force program can be put down on an

annual basis for carrying it out year by year, to finally achieve the expected objectives. Now, based on the result of the said procedure and the needs of the forces, plans and programs for preparing the operation can be set up. Various plans for meeting various situations should be carefully made up as war fighting preparation ( see  the  illustration  table below).

# The Present Defense Policy

## Basic Idea 1.

a.

Obey the constitution to realize the Three People's Principles. Maintain the independence, freedom, and equality for maintaining the integrity of national sovereignty .

b.

Defend Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu, and Wuchiu, Pratas and Spratly Archipelagoes. Eliminate the invading enemies in order to safeguard the national security.

c.

The basic idea of national defense is to survive first, to develop next; to stop the war but not to be afraid of war, to prepare for war but not to seek the war. Holding the initiative but not the uninitiative in forming our strategy. If the enemy starts the war, The ROC will have to defend and to fight for every inch of the land, for protecting the security of this base.

d.

Develop the concept of all-people defense. Encourage the total willpower of the people. Defense work and livelihood should be unified. In peacetime, the underpinning of war fighting capabilities should be well planted in the society. There must be a plan for an

instant mobilization of the societal strength for fighting the war.

## 2. Overall Strategic Concept

The Armed Forces, at the moment under the policy guidance of "strong defensive posture " and " effective deterrence ", are actively building up the necessary capabilities. Facing the enemy threat, types of war, national power, the armed forces are expediting the building up of the second generation's capabilities, and enlarging the backup reserve strength for fast mobilization. The nation should rely on the air control, sea control, and counter-landing warfare to perform the total defense in order to protect the nationand safety of people's lives and prosperity.

## 3. Building Up Of Military Strength

> The building up of the defensive capabilities is based on
"the concept of the force-construction" and "improvement of the forces" for "having the kind of troops for performing the kind of missions", or in other words, "right kind of weapons will be available to fight the right kind of war". That is an ideal case, in order to realize that for practical purpose, the force-building has to be accomplished year by year , period by period. The ROC have to let the enemy think twice, before blundering into the war. That is our strategic concept to safeguard ourselves.

To continue ROC's policy of simplifying and sharpening a.

the Armed Forces "air superiority, local sea control are 64

## Military Situation

b.

라 of foremost importance, anti-blockade capabilities is a mandate while to win the fighting at the beach is dominating". Basing on the above-mentioned principle and the goal of "automation, entirety, mobilization, and three-dimemsionalization", the ROC are to build up "a small size but very sharp", "rapid response" and "top efficient" types of troops.

Military weapons can be procured from foreign countries, self-production, and cooperative production.

By improving the quality of existent weapons as well as the structure and building of the second-generation forces, air-defense, anti-blockade, and anti-landing capability will be greatly enhanced.

Military build-up is a long-term process, during which the use of armed forces might be necessary due to the threat of war. In preparation for the possible outbreak of war, the MND has given the instruction that in accordance with the spirit of "fight with what we have now" based on the currentstage strength and the capability of follow-up mobilization, the forces must be duly organized, and plans of combat readiness and wartime actions must also be well formulated to meet any possible war.

## 4. Conduct Of Defense Operation

The guidance for current defense is based on "not to provoke any war while not to escape from the war" under any possible circumstances. Our strategy is to prepare for a protracted war, while our tactic is to fight the enemy 66

vehemently with coordinated fire power, to let the enemy pay the prices as high as possible, should they dare to invade.

Many strongholds will be firmly defended, while the mobile counter-offensive reserves will annihilate the oncoming enemies. The enemy´s attrition will be so high as to contribute to our final victory.

# Combat Readiness

## 1. Basic Readiness For Operation

 전주 In peacetime, to prevent overall national constructions from being affected by the move for combat readiness, the military sticks to the principle of "keeping fewer soldiers in peacetime while mobilizing more forces in wartime " by maintaining the least possible battle force to meet the basic need for keeping national security. Nevertheless, to make sure that the forces can be rapidly mobilized for war, national manpower, material, financial resources, and morale must be effectively coordinated to safeguard national security. Besides making the training of standing forces a regular routine, recall of reserve forces for re-education is also listed as a main point of the national policy.

Extend the range of social education by conducting the a.

training of reserve forces, so as to enable the people of the ROC to understand that modern wars equal to all-out wars, that the chance of victory depends on the willpower of the entire people, and that only by hanging together can the ROC win in the long-term peaceful competition with the PRC.

b.

Reinforce the organization of "nation-wide defense

mobilization"; integrate the efforts made by various departments of the government in internal affairs, finances, economic construction, transportation and communication, culture, and propaganda; establish networks of mobilization readiness such as morale, manpower, material, economy, finances, transportation and communications as well as hygiene; make preliminary planning, gathering nation-wide manpower, material, and finances in accordance with such measures as survey, registration, grouping, propaganda, lecturing, and storing.

To protect personal life and property and also for the C.

sake of national security, hold regular meetings on the coordination of total mobilization; establish a consensus of "integrated defense" among the people, enabling them to understand, and thus support, the need of the military to put the limited manpower, finances, and space to the greatest use.

In line with the annual planned policy and the training schedule of the standing forces, conduct the following simulated activities maneuvering military-related

![99_image_0.png](99_image_0.png)

industries; selecting desired governmental and civilian factories to conduct the conversion of production to military equipment and material: requisitioning strategic material and transport vehicles as well as convening for military service. All the above maneuvers are intended to make sure that the project of total mobilization is indeed feasible.

Issue a "wartime mobilization plan " based on the
ਂ 
e.

principle of combat readiness, so that there will be no

difficulty in acquiring enough manpower, material, and financial resources to meet wartime demand.

f.

:
By law, reserve forces should receive about 30 days of retraining every year to return to their normal combat capability. Considering that the retraining is of different durations for the three forces, the MND has decided for the moment on the length of 5 to 7 days required for the army field troops. However, with the increase of special skills in the forces, the training will be prolonged to 1416 days in 1997.

## 2. Readiness For Crises

The PRC has never given up her intention of armed ن ي invasion of Taiwan; its surprise attack capability has been improving with the renewal of weapons and the establishment of rapid reaction troops. Facing this situation, the ROC government has decided to focus on the elevation of alertness to meet the PRC's possible attack.

a.

The military would keep in close contact with the Ministry of Interior for social security and order. Besides improving the functions of " civilian defense organizations", the military also aims at the safeguard of various defense- and livelihood-related factories and stations such as reservoirs, power stations, and petrol refineries. Air defense exercises should be held regularly with an emphasis on the kind without early warning. Reconnaissance aircraft will be used to strengthen the b.

joint coast-line monitoring system. The military is also seeking to self-produce or purchase from abroad long-

range ground-to-air and ground-to-surface radars so as to gain more early warning time for combat readiness. The military also intends to set up a satellite monitoring and reconnaissance system in the future. This project will cost a lot and therefore needs the support of the entire peoples.

c.

:
Important military and civilian facilities will be moved underground. The safeguard of barrack security will be expanded into a regional security defense system.

d.

To strengthen the military´s command and control system, rapid reaction troops will be deployed near the places liable to enemy attack. They will be put on the alert round-the-clock to meet any contingencies and to enable the other troops to complete combat readiness in time.

## 3. Readiness For War

To put into practice the strategic concepts of "strong defensive posture" and "effective deterrence" as well as
"durable strategy" and "speedy tactics", the ROC military currently aims at the elevation of joint-service air-defense, anti-blockade, and anti-landing combat capability, so as to prevent Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu from being attacked by the PRC.

Reinforce education of patriotism in the military, a.

improve military discipline, and build up confidence among the forces. Fully employ local manpower and material in line with wartime military operation. In accordance with the thinking of "fighting, equipping, b.

70 organizing, training", keep studying military operation principles and review the plans of force organization and defense operation to disrupt the PRC's various high-tech war patterns.

c.

Focus annual training projects on firing, night combatting, and joint operation; tighten military discipline and training; launch air-defense, antiblockade, and anti-landing maneuvers regularly; check the availability of civilian telecommunication facilities in support of military operation; conduct exercises of roads and bridges repair work.

d.

Improve logistics system; simplify operation procedure; encourage civilian industries to participate in defense work; foster civilian ability in the maintenance and repair of important weapons and equipment as well as in the supply of livelihood necessities by the process of defense technology transfer.

 - 1 Because of the force reduction policy of the ROC and the number of eligible conscripts are getting less and less yearly ,
therefore the total personnel strength is decreasing; but it does not follow that the fighting quality is also descending. It is, however, ascending because of the "universality and higher-level of education, and metabolism of the manpower".

2.

3. 

The length of conscript period must not in any cases be further shortened. As far as the recruiting system is concerned, either adopt the voluntary service or count some social works as equivalents to the military service. The main issue of building up of Armed Forces is the acquisition and renewal of equipment and weaponry. A
"Procurement Bureau" has specially been set up by the Ministry of National Defense (MND) to centralize the work of procurement, which is to be more institutionalized, professionalized, and more transparent to the public.

4.

Defense industries are foundations of the national defense.

Defense establishments, academic sectors and industries have to be linked up. Powers for defense should be planted in the civilian sectors to achieve self-sufficiency. There must be more satellite factories, better procurement and close cooperation with foreign industries.

1.

The total area of land used by and under the management of the military establishment amounts to 36,000 hectares which can be classified into three categories:
a.

land that the military has the priority to use; land used for general military purpose; b. 

c. 

land not directly used by the military.

The acquisition or release of the land are being done according to "the Law of the Land" and "the Act of National-owned Land".

For the Fiscal Year of 1996, the MND will be charged 6.

legally to administrate a defense budget of NT dollars 258, 336,911,000, 22.76% of the whole governmental budget; or 3.56% of the GDP. In comparison with the 1995 defense budget, it has been decreased. It is clear that the trend of national defense budget has been declined year by year.

At the present stage, the research and development of 7.

science and technology for the national defense are observing the principles of "underpinning, integration, interchangeability, and continuity" whilst the research and development for the administrative work are observing the principles of "fundamental, innovation, and feasible" for the sake of elevating the working efficiency.

# Manpower

## I . Manpower Resource

Manpower is one of the important national resources, of which the spectrum and quality of the population have a great deal to do with the development of defense. The eligible defense population refers to those citizens who can be recruited to serve in the armed forces, and who are capable to support the defense. Based on national laws of conscription, plans and employment of the manpower for defense can be worked out for the government.

## 1. General Situation Of The Manpower

According to the index of population, a statistics published by the Ministry of Interior in July 1995, the total population of Taiwan and Fujian ( those parts of Fujian under the jurisdictional control of the ROC), by the end of 1994 amounted to 21,177,874 persons, of which 10,907,032 are males, 51.5% of the total population. The number of male population from age 18 to 45 amounted to 5,060,538 persons, which is 46.4% of the male population of the said age categories; there were 3, 818, 799 persons registered under the control of military reserve status ( officers:

306,377, NCOs: 1,333,942, enlisted: 2,178,480 ). The reserve status was 75.48% of the 18-45 ages category. The family-planning (birth control) launched by the government has been rather successful; consequently, the eligible male population has been decreasing. To take the year 1976 for example, the birth of male babies was 218,659 in number. In 1996, the eligible males for military service were only 176,895 persons. According to the index of the total population of Taiwan and Fujian of the year 1994, except of the year 1976, all the rest years in the recent past, the rate of birth was in negative growth. Apart from that, there are other reasons for decreasing the number of recruits, such as the physical strength of the people seems to be in decline, average of criminal age is also getting younger, physically unfit for military service are also getting more. We can predict that the number of population good for military services will be going down. The numbers of eligible recruits from 1996-2005 are as shown in Chart 3-1.

The grading of physical condition of servicemen is based on the "Servicemen Physical Condition Grading Standard" issued by the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Interior. According to the standard, physical condition can be defined by five grades: A, B, C,
D and E. Those who are graded A and B can serve in the active service, while those graded C and D serve shortterm. Grade E is hard to define and therefore further physical examination is demanded until the grade level can be made certain.

Birth of the Male (1993 - 1995)

## 2. Quality Of Manpower

While it is due to the policy of force reduction; and the reasons of getting less surprised of manpower, yet, nevertheless, the quality of manpower is getting better. This is because of higher level of education and knowledge of the population, augmented by the "metabolism" of the personnel. In 1993 recruit of the high school graduates were 81.35%, while in 1995 that was lifted to 82.82% (The analysis of the educational level of officers, NCOs, and soldiers is as shown by Chart 3-2 )

and Soldiers

Educational Le

## 3. Recruiting System

The design on how to recruit for serving the military is to meet the defense needs. There are basically two ways:
the compulsory and the voluntary. Factors for considering which way to choose are: population, territories, boundaries, assumed aggressors and war as perceived. Most countries who rely on the voluntary way are usually finding themselves in more peaceful environment, in better defensive position and in limited, easier manageable number of troops required. Those countries who adopt compulsory services are usually finding themselves in a more likely war condition and are having to maintain a rather large size of troops.

Since June 17, 1933, the ROC government published
"the Law of Recruiting" which adopted a composite way; that is, both the compulsory and the voluntary ways working together. Officers and NCOs are mainly from the voluntary way augmented by the conscripts while the enlisted men mainly from the compulsory way and supplemented by some volunteers. The two ways, voluntary and compulsory have been working together satisfactorily.

But, nevertheless, in recent years, because of the stable political and economic development, the change of the societies plus the intercations across the Taiwan Straits, the sense of crises among the people has been weakened; thus making some people to advocate the idea of adopting the voluntary service only, and shortening the period of service as well as to count some social works as equivalents to the military service. Here, we need some discussion in the following:
a.

Problems of the Voluntary Service In order to make any system work for a nation and contribute to her people, it must suit the conditions of that particular nation. Based on our historical experience and our current political situation, we must therefore maintain sufficient ready forces to meet any contingencies, instead of shifting into an all-voluntary force. The reasons are as follows:
From the System Point of View
(1) 
It is not fair to go by voluntary way only; it will lay the defense responsibilities unevenly among the

people (the number of the poor are more than the number of the rich). To serve by compulsory law, everybody has an equal opportunity.

(2)
From the Mobilization Point of View It will be good for a nation to be able "to keep as few troops as possible in peace time and to mobiliźe quickly in war". By the voluntary method, the volunteers serve longer by contract, their fighting skill would be better by longer training; but, the disadvantage lies in the fact that there will be less number of militarily trained manpower which can be reserved in the civilian sector for mobilization in case of war. The reserves can be called up in a very short time to join the fighting. By voluntary way, fewer trained manpower are in reserve for supplement and replacement of the fighting troops.

It would take much longer time to train new comers. In the compulsory service, portions of the troops can be used in peace time for some work such as construction for improving the livelihood of the people.

From the Financial Burden Point of View
(3) 
In the compulsory method, the pay of the draftees can be adjusted within the financial feasibility of the government. If it goes to the voluntary only, pays have to be much more elevated to meet the standard of the job-market, which, in turn, will be a great burden for the government.

From the Troops Replacement Point of View
(4)
This country is still seriously facing the threat from

the PRC. It is mandatory to keep sufficient forces in to safeguard the country. Within the jurisdictional control of the territory, all kinds of resources are limited. The only way to meet our military requirement is to adopt the compulsory method. If it goes by voluntary only, the young men in a affluent society may not like to join the military on a kind of the hardship in training and disciplinary lives demanded by the military. When war breaks out, the increase of pay will not be a motivation to make the young men to join, and there will be no laws either to enforce them to join the Armed Forces.

b. Shortening the Length of Service By the "Law of Recruiting", the length for the
(1)
draftees are two years for the Army, three years for the Navy and Air Force. After completing the length of service, the draftees are retired. In the same law, there are also rules to retire earlier than the completing the length, rules to prolong the length as well as the rules for calling up for counting and short training. In consideration of the principle of fairness and to clear the way for the soldiers relieved of service to go back to school or college, the MND , on July 1, 1990, allowed the draftees of Navy and the Air Force to shorten the length of three years to two, making the service length for the three services equally to be two years.

The length of service is carefully designed basd on

the factors of the needs for combat readiness, manpower supply, training time, the needs of societal constructions, education level required to joining the military service as well as the factor of sufficiency of the permanent personnel and force level requirement. Two-year service, however, does not satisfy the demand of some highclassification specialists; the MND is therefore working on military occupational specialty (MOS)
selection and the problem of "improving the system of NCOs" hopefully to get the specialists. The MND is also encouraging the draftees to shift to the voluntary service; thus the military capabilities and security of the nation might be upgraded.

Therefore, the length of military service should not be further shortened.

The Problem of Social-work Service

## C.

(1)
The condition in each different country is different with each other. Although there are some countries which may consider the participating of some social welfare work or laboring work as equivalents to the military service, but the prerequisites are that it does not hurt the supplies of manpower to the military; the country must also be not under an eminent threat from a hostile foreign country; and the program is designed for supporting some national construction work.

The supply of manpower is already not meeting the
(2)
demand of military manpower. The threat from the PRC to Taiwan is not reducing. If we, at this

moment, transfer military service to some social work, it will further worsen the shortfall of military manpower supply. Besides, if the military support only some kind of social works, the other kind will follow suit. It is hard to determine to whom, which kind of social work and how to support. It will also hurt the domestic chances of employment; and also the entire fairness of the recruiting .

## Ii . Structure Of The Manpower -

Ratio of personnel strength among the Army, Navy and Air Force-the force objective and age spectrum are the basis of force structure. A sound structure "would save the billets , personnel strength, increase the fire power and mobility" and keeps the Armed Forces staying young and strong.

## 1. Force Structure

Ratio among the Army, Navy and Air Force as lain down for the 1996 are: Army 51.08%, Navy 14.35%, Air Force 14.15%, Combined Service Forces 2.05%, Reserve Corps Command 5.39%, Central Command (not include the Military Police) 8.58%, Military Police 4.4%.

## 2. Force Reduction

The total complement of the Armed Forces has come down from some 500,000 people in 1994 to about 460,000 people in 1996. The reduction amounts to about 30, 000 84 1996 National Defense Report people.

## 3. Age Spectrum

In 1995, the average age of armed force is 23.65 years old, of which the officers 30.82, NCOs 23.52, enlisted men 21.06. Chart 3-3 and Table 3-1 show the average ages of commanding officers, the comparison of officers, NCO and enlistmen. )

## Ii . Manpower Planning

Manpower has its limitation. A good planning of how to employ it effectively has to consider the whole development of armed forces and the whole requirement of manpower for other development as well. A cost-benefit analysis and a good management of the manpower must be included in the studies.

## 1. Getting The Manpower

Working enviroment in the armed forces must be further improved. Raise the pays and other incentives.

Manpower in fact comes from the civilian; therefore, the method of job classifications admission and retirement regulations must be well executed. Armed Forces Academy has their joint examination for enrollment. Reserve officers

are obtained by admission or selection examination. Female officers and NCOs can also be enrolled by examination.

There are other rules for giving the scholarship to officers, for persons entering the armed services by self-designated jobs (see Footnote 1), for cooperation between the civilian academies or other institutions in armed forces (Footnote 2), for re-enlisting (Footnote 3), for hiring and enrolling civilian employees, for giving the national jobs certificates
(Footnote 4 ). All these methods are applied to get manpower into the armed forces. The recruits would be admitted into armed forces for various lengths of time, to fulfill the demand of manpower of the military.

## 2. Supplement Of The Manpower

The tables of organization (translators note: T.O.&E)
are to be worked out according to the mission of various units. Different complements of the same unit can be laid down for different periods of time; such as, for fighting war or for peace time. Those units which are not directly in the first front can have some of the billets unfilled. Some of those non-combatant units, such as the logistic or care and maintenance units, manufacturing, hospitals can be transferred to the civilian sectors. It also be done by making contracts with the civilian outfits. Many other non-directcombat related jobs should employ more females or those civilians who are already hired by the military. The direct combatant manpower would thus be strengthened.

## 3. Manpower Management

The military personnel, since joining the military

service until retirement, and even after retirement are being handled by a well-designed management of manpower.

Problems have been established for "enrolling, training, employing, retiring and veteran-caring". A job classification system has been used to develop the career planning for each person serving in the military. According to the need of organizations and advancement of the weapon system.

## 4. The Uses Of Manpower

Effectively use those special skill of the draftees before they are drafted to meet some of the needs required by the military. The needs might be different in peace and war time. Some commonplace logistic duties and administrative work can be performed by the college graduates and also by the students graduated from high school and polytechnical schools. There are also specialist who can be used by the military to meet its long-term requirements. It will also reduce the cost of education in the military. Therefore, the table of organization should have the flexibility in defining the jobs for each billet, making one billet to be performed by more than one specific person, while one person can do various jobs. By doing so, it would help the work abilities of a person after he retires from the military. Many training schools of the same nature in different military service can be combined into fewer schools to reduce the unnecessary duplication. Better and more scientific methods and device should be utilized by the armed forces. Strict rules should be applied to prevent the military manpower from wasting.

The ratio of administrative type to the military professional type should be reduced.

Self-designated job: see Part V, Chapter 2, Section 2.

The cooperations between academic circles and the military refer to such cases as, for example. To use the civilian universities or schools, together with the professors and their teachings to come and use the military facilities and equipment to teach and work for the repairing job for the more modern, second-generation aircraft.

Certificates to be given to the officers and men who are working in the military now, by the specific civilian officials to verify their specific job experience and skill.

The certificates will be useful for the officers and men after their retirement to find new jobs.

## I . The Acquisition Of Weaponry And Equipment

This country has two important tasks to perform simultaneously. One task is to have enough capabilities for defending Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu by the possible attack from the other side of the Taiwan Straits. Another task is to modernize and to continuously build up our defense forces. These two related tasks constitute our main work.

## 1. Policy

" Our weapon systems must serve for multiple purposes ", "must be interchangeable among the three services" and "we must rely on improved quality, rather than larger quantities". We are to obtain our weapon system either from our own R&D, or from foreign countries. But the basic principles are to rely on ourselves for defense and serve our overall national interests.

## 2. The Procedure

The MND has amended the regulations known as "the operating procedure of the committee on requirement,

system analysis and decision-making" to further improve the acquisition of weapons for the armed forces and to assist the newly established procurement office. The operating procedure was started on 1 July, 1995. The regulations were based on strategic planning which comprises the long-range strategic studies (concept of building up the armed forces),
itemize the needed weapon system and equipment (program for force restructuring). Data on individual weapon system has to be gathered first. Outlines for acquiring, and priorities on all the needed weapons have to be put down in connection with the availability of funding. The needed weapon system will then be put into yearly programs. To clearly define the approval operation of weapon acquisition so as to reach a common goal of decision making, several committees have been set up in accordance with the characteristics specific to each stage of the process of weapon acquisition and approval: requirement committee, sorting committee, decision making committee, and acquisition approving committee. These committees team up to supervise the acquisition projects of critical weapons and equipment. Authorities of each level are well defined, so are the duties of the supervision. By going through this new procedure, we are hopefully to be cost effective on weapons and equipment acquisition.

## Ii . Purchasing Of Military Hardware

In this section, a very brief account is given on the policy ( execution ) and "pushing work in the future ".

Purchasing is an important link in the whole chain of the

military hardware acquisition. It is a down-stream activity.

## 1. The Policy

a.

The requirement of a certain weapon or equipment is generated out of the need to perform a certain mission and based on a fundamentally stream-line plan. The first step is to go through a system analysis in order to well understand the pros and cons of purchasing the specific weapons. If the analysis shows favorable, the said weapon will be listed in the yearly financial program. Without being put into the financial program, there will be no fund for the specific item.

Only after going through the proper procedure, the purchasing work can thus be executed. To purchase a certain item also means to acquire the b.

c.

know-how of producing it. The military also wants to help the industries in-country for attending the selfsufficiency and independence in weapon production.

If a certain item can be produced in-country, all the specification of the items made in Taiwan can be a substitute for the following made items, then the purchasing will be done with that made in Taiwan. The question of "from which foreign country to buy" should be compatible with the national trading policy which will be supported by the military.

d.

In principle, purchasing of a certain hardware should be done directly with foreign manufacturers ( or companies), but for practical purpose, it can, in some cases, be bought from business firms, sale companies or representative agents who have contract or who are

designated by the foreign manufacturers or original companies.

e.

Purchasing of military devices is to be done by centralized authorities. But, as the case may be, power can be delegated to lower echelon to do the work. For in-country buying, each military service can do 'it themselves, if the cost of the item is less than NT $ 50 million, price of any item over NT $ 50 million, the MND will ask the procurement office to handle it. For foreign purchasing, any item under the price of US $ 1 million, each military service (including the Chungshan Institute) will be delegated with authority to execute the purchasing. For price over US $1 million, the purchasing will be submitted to the MND which would hand it over to the office of procurement stationed abroad.

The other policy regarding which foreign country to buy f.

is done by the principle of dispersing the places so that we will not rely only on a particular place. In short, we should not become too dependent on only a certain specific area.

## 2. Execution

a.

The Flow-steps of Procurement
(1)
Planning-application Step The units which apply for procurement have to present their plans of intended procurement that should be based on the financial plan approved by the Legislative Yuan. A Copy of the application plans after being validated by related agencies is to
(2) 
be submitted to the Ministry of Auditing.

Step of Bidding and Contracting This is the step for executing the plan which will be carried out by various purchasing offices of the armed forces. The procedure embraces the following :
(a) 
To Study the Condition for Procurement With actual procuring experience, the step is to find if there exists any unsuitable and unfeasible conditions in the application plans; if so, the applying units may be asked to explain or to modify their plans for ensuring that the quality and timing of the targeted items will be good.

1996 National Defense Report
94

![127_image_0.png](127_image_0.png)

## Contracting · (B)

Commonplace Purchasing: Services are to use the standard format of contract which includes the Commonplace articles on guarantee of durability, penalty of damage, breach of terms and payment, and so forth. But the standard format may be properly modified to suit the special situation, case by case. Legal advisors should be consulted in making the contracts to protect the right of the armed forces.

Military Sale: The quotation documents i .

issued by the US government are generally to be used. If we want to add articles concerning the guarantee of durability ( warranty ), " delay of delivery" and so forth, we may do so, nevertheless, the final prices may be higher than other source ountries.

ii .

In case, the purchasing price is NT $ 50 million or over, by article 5 of the supervision rule on " governmental constructions, purchases, ordering and sales of properties, " officers from the -
Military of Auditing will be asked to supervise the purchase.

iii .

The procurement office stationed in foreign countries are also bound by article 28 of the afore-said rules, and are iv .

required to send copies of their tables on comparison of the quotation, result of the bidding and contract for the verification of the auditing agencies concerned.

(3)
Step on Delivery and Acceptance Everyone who is responsible for auditing and examining the planning, the purchasing, and contracting must get together to see if the seller has complied with the contract in quality, quantity, delivery time and place; for making the payment or asking the penalty. To sum up, from what has been mentioned above, we can see that all along the various steps of purchasing, the auditing and controlling agencies have been participating all the way so as to give full play to its role of supervision.

Executing of Some Major Items
(1)
To Form a Procurement Bureau b.

(a) On 1 July, 1995, various previously purchasing units were integrated into an overall procurement bureau, responsible for overall planning and purchasing the major weapon system and equipment required by the armed forces. At the same time, training and education of the purchasing officers, the career controlling and developing , together with streaming the lines of whole purchasing work were made. The goal is to institutionalize, professionalize and to make it as transparent as may be wished.

Organization of the Procurement Bureau
(b)
Underneath the procurement bureau, there are five divisions, two sections, and one foreign procurement unit stationed abroad as illustrated by Table 3-2. Before the amendment of the organization of the MND, the procurement office is temporarily operating in the Department of Chief of the General Staff.

(2) 
"Studies on How to Improve the Procurement System" Starting from 1994, the MND began its studies on the problems of purchasing and their related issues. The MND made a report to the Legislative Yuan in a paper entitled
"Review and Improvement on the Purchasing of Military Hardware". In January 1995, eight study-groups were set up to study in depth the matters of purchasing with regard to the study work of personnel, education, purchasing, planning, political warfare, comptroller, judge advocate, clerical and files work.

Provide the Public with Information about the
(3)
Purchase of Military Hardware A handbook on "questions and answers on how to participate in the purchasing of military hardware" had been published to facilitate those manufacturers and businessmen who may be interested in knowing or in doing business

with the military. Information service and channels have also been set up to answer any inquiries made by the people. These work are being done for the sake of meeting the desires of the people for openness and transparency of the military purchasing.

(4)
Keep on Enacting and Revising Procurement Regulations To support the governmental policy of free market and liberalizing and internationalizing of trades, the "operating procedures and regulations " have been amended, and submitted to the Executive Yuan` for approval in order to simplify the working procedure and lift its efficiency.

## 3. The Future Trend Of Endeavoring

a.

To work diligently in the preparation to meet the situation after the government publishes its "Regulation of Governmental Purchasing", and enters the World Trade Organization. Purchasing procedures will have to be corrected and improved as time goes by.

b.

To bring up more staff to be internationally knowledgeable, to educate and develop their career as well as to enable the experiences gained to pass on their successors. These constitute the essential work in purchasing mission.

![132_image_0.png](132_image_0.png)

Table 3-2 Organization of Procurement Bureau, MND
c.

It is also necessary to have proper ways of managing the manufacture's representatives and agencies of foreign firms. They should be recorded for tracing and employment.

d.

Communication channels for complaining, for inquiring of information and services are to be set up in coordination with other governmental agencies.

## Iii . Defense  Industries

The defense industries are the foundation on which defense are built. The industry covers a large scope which

## 1996 National Defense Report 100 Policy 1.

must be well planted in the civilian industry which can then support and sustain the defense. The end of the MND is to acquire an independent defense industry; to breakthrough in defense technology and to increase the capacities of defense industries. For that, the MND has laid down the plan and program for the development of armed forces' weapons and equipment.

The armed forces have laid down the concept, plans and programs for the development of the weapon system. The goal is to well lay the defense on the civilian industries which should be well cooperated with the military, governmental and private owned industries. Two main principles should be emphasized:
the needs for combat readiness and the costeffectiveness.

a.

For major military procurement abroad, we are also seeking the technical know-how and cooperation for the upgrading of our own general industrial level.

b.

By integrating the military industries with that of the civilian, it is expected that many military factories can be gradually reduced.

c. d.

Upgrading the civilian industries and extending the military manufacturing capabilities can also help our own economic growth as well as the diplomacy.

Setting up more military related satellite factories and ordering the military gears to train the satellite factories to try to produce goods and buy the goods from them. These are steps taken to make our own e.

nation attain self-sufficiency.

f.

The good mobilization base is laid on the idea of
"mobilization is actually contained in the governmental execution of the public affairs and the underpinning of the war preparation is the economic growth".

## 2.

Operation System for the Development of Defense Industry (as shown by Table 3-3)
a.

"Policy guidance committee for the developing of defense industry" is established. in the Executive Yuan, underneath which there is one "joint verification board for the developing of defense industry, together with eight groups as illustrated by the chart.

The defense industrial development foundation:
The funds for the foundation come from the donations of the people and government. They are to be used to support the R&D of the military, public and private industries in the joint effort to upgrade the scientific and technological level of the defense production.

Cooperation of the military and civilian industries:
b.

c.

The Ministries of National Defense and Economics work together to facilitate the operation of industrial mobilization and preparation. Both ministries play the role of pushing forward the concerted development.

## 3. Achievement

Direct public and private industries in military production :
a. 

Trial order for military products:
Sort our domestic public and private factories with ability or technique of producing military goods, paying them for trial production and helping them to improve their production equipment and technology. Statistics show that over the past years, the number of the participant factories who have been awarded certificates for their success in the R&D projects totals 398 with a total output of 3,421 military items.

Satellite factories:
(1) 
(2)
To encourage public and private factories to join in the defense industry so as to elevate the potential of wartime industrial production, several excellent companies have been selected as satellite factories and also incorporated into the system of military production. By the end of December, 1995, the number of factories selected totaled 157 with an output potential of 1,395 military items.

Research and trial production:
(3)
Entrust domestic high-tech research institutions or public and private businesses to improve and turn embryonic blueprints or samples into up-tostandard products by the process of R&D.

(4)
Sponsor the tours of military-related establishments so that civilian businesses can better understand the

b. 

situation of military factories In 1995, about 300-odd representatives from civilian businesses made a tour of some Army, Navy, and Air-Force units.

Support civilian universities to launch defense technology related graduate schools: 
Aviation & Space Industry Graduate School of
(1)
National Cheng-kung University: The construction project of a new Aviation & Space Center; the instruments required for five
"hydrodynamics and aerodynamics" laboratories and one experimental factory.

Applied Mechanics Graduate School of National
(2) 
Taiwan University:
Construction of a new research building; the instruments for computer centers and laboratories of compound material mechanics and laser.

(3)
Electronics & Information Research Center of National Chiao-tung University:
Instruments for an "IC technology and design "
laboratory and two other laboratories.

(4)
Material Science Research Center of National Ching-hwa University:
Instruments for "high-energy material combustion" and "photoelectric material" laboratories.

Encourage domestic university professors to conduct c.

specific research subjects of defense: 348 papers have been completed, and 15 papers are currently under way.

Offer related graduate schools defense industry d.

scholarship:
.

537 recipients of the grant - PhD 86 and MA 451 -
joined in the R&D of defense technology upon graduating.

e.

Enact "procedure of providing preferential loans from defense industry development fund" to those companies manufacturing military products: Provide low-interest loans to the companies manufacturing military products for the purchase of special machinery and material. So far 13 companies have filed their applications for loans, which amount to NT $ 99,502,000.

f.

Sign cooperative research projects with domestic universities and research institutions:
Based on the principle of "self-producing battle ships, aircraft, and missile weapon system", a coordination committee on academic cooperation of national technology has signed 1,527 cooperative projects with 20-odd domestic universities and research institutions; 1,359 cases of the above-mentioned projects have been directly applied to various important R&D projects conducted by Academia Sinica. Help public and private industries improve their g.

technological capability:
To help public and private industries improve their ability in technology so that they are capable of joining in the production of military goods, the Technology Service Center of Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology has been expanded since 1995 into a
"service center for companies entrusted with military

production", responsible for the transfer of defense technology to to civilian  companies.  Since  its establishment, this center has held 15 briefing conferences on technology transfer, introduceitems, entered into contract with 81 companies for authorized production, and totaled 1,365 cases in the offer of technology service.

Conduct evaluation on companies entrusted with h.

military production:
A joint tour of defense industry is launched every year to understand current output ability and technology of public and private factories. After-tour reports and these companies opinions would be sent to the related departments for review. To enable civilian companies to join the line of military production under open and above-board circumstances, the government has entrusted an institution to conduct assessment on the capability of military production. By 1995, among the 450-odd companies assd, 304 ranked as "qualified".

Direct the mobilized factories to complete defense industry readiness:
The targeted factories are demanded to refer to related units for the implementation of the "military production conversion project". In 1995, the military production mobilization project totaled 517 items.

Display defense industry products:
i. 

j .

To encourage more civilian companies to join defense industry production, an exhibition of 282 defense industry products was held from April 12-14, 1995, and, at this exhibition, about 140 companies registered for defense industry production.

## 4. Future Endeavor

a.

The military will carry on the joint efforts of the military, academic and industrial sector, and revise the policy and methodology for the defense productivity.

Speed up the network of core-satellite factories.

b.

c.

Keeping in touch with the civilian industries, simplifying the operating procedures, protecting their rights and profit, collecting and evaluating more of their data in order to ensure the long-range benefit of the defense industry.

d.

From the major foreign procurement and its associated importing of technology, to cooperate and elevate the scientific and technological level of this country.

e.

Extend the scope of producing common items which have both military and civilian uses. Release some of the results and findings of the military R&D to the civilian uses which would improve the national industry.

Within the financial availability of the military, more f.

existing designs, blue prints, models and samples and tools should be made, ready for the transferring of some of the defense production to civilian production in wartime.

Coordinate with the local civil government to make g.

more surveying on the amount of raw material, stockpile, current distribution as well as the industrial manpower and the training programs for mobilization plans.

## Iv . The Uses Of Land For Defense

The land used for defense purpose spreads over Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu. It needs a good planning and management of the land.

## 1. Policy Of Management

Based on the principles of "centralize in command",
"decentralize in control", the management of the land is divided into four echelons: "formulating the policy ",
"commanding the uses", "local controlling", and "care and preservation". The MND is the policy decision maker, the three services GHQs, Army reserve command, Military Police Command and the general affairs office (MND) are in the controlling echelons. The acquisition or releasing of the land have to be done by "Law of the Land" and "Law of National-owned Land". The policy on the uses of the land for the Armed Forces would also be considerations to the other national major construction project besides the military necessities.

The land which is being used for fortress, military air a.

bases, naval harbors, combat runways, missile bases, permanent defense work, military communications, electronic listening facilities, and major training grounds have to be kept for military uses. There are no other alternative grounds for releasing them. Some land neighboring the above-mentioned military-use land is restricted areas because of technical reasons.

Nevertheless, some portions might be used for lowdensity civilian constructions, or open green spaces, parks, cattle pastures, etc. , so long as they don't cause technical interference to the military facilities.

If, after reviewing, it is found that some possibilities exist for considerations of moving away some military establishment to the suburbs, or remote low hill locations, to give grounds for city development, it then might be done with the foreign prerequisites.

b. 

(1) Barracks:
The locations for military barracks must have a quick access to meet the technical requirement for t performing their missions. Arsenals and Warehouses:
If the arsenals and warehouses, and repairing facilities are to be moved away, new locations must not be so visible that it would be good for air defense. The other points for selection of the new locations are: enough spaces for storage, good supply of water and electricity, easy connection with their satellite factories.

(2)
Military Education and Training Colleges and Schools:
The new location must be good for easiness of carrying out the task as well as sufficient spaces, and good communication roads with their instructors, lecturers, professors, etc.

(3)
Small-type Training Grounds :
The size of the ground should match the nature of their training. They should have enough space for the combat practice, distances for weapon range,
(4)

and not too far away from the barracks of the trainees.

In spite of the fact that some land has belonged to the c.

military; nevertheless, they were only used for the quarters of military dependents, or there were no plans for direct military uses. These land can be used for community development or for building apartments and military dependent houses in working together with local governments.

## 2. The Situations Of The Land Used By The Military:

Land used by the military amounts to some 36,410 hectares, of which 35,110 hectares are being used for barracks, combat constructions, military air bases, naval -- harbors and piers, arsenal and factories, warehouses, training grounds and educational schools and training.

(Army uses 15,400 hectares, Navy uses 4,200 hectares, Air Force uses 10,760 hectares, CSF 800 hectares, Commands of Reserves and Coast Forces 400 hectares, M. P. 100 hectares, the units directly under the MND uses 3, 450 hectares ). The military dependents quarters use 1,300 hectares. The lands can be classified into three categories as follows:
a.

## Military Priority Land:

This is the land of strategic and tactical value where the military must occupy for defense purposes, and put troops there. The fortress, important training ground, and some control-zone also have the military priorities.

General Purpose Military Land:
b. 

They are not directly connected with war fighting, but their uses are also mandatory, such as the arsenals, military establishment and military schools.

c.

Non-direct Military Zone:
Such as military dependent houses, some unused land, and land which have plans to build up for military purposes. The land can be used for local government's development plans and for improving the living conditions of the military dependents.

## 3. Future Trend

a.

To support the national major projects and the local governments constructions, the military would give due considerations to move some existing sites. The applications of using the military lands have to be made at least six months ahead. The governing rules as published by the Executive Yuan are known as "Rules on the Moving Away of Military Facilities for the Construction Projects of the Local Government in Taiwan". While the local government makes the application, a detailed plan has to be enclosed to state where the original military facilities can be moved. The military service GHQs and the units who are using the site have to be notified. The said plan must contain the ways of moving the site, the compensation for the loss caused by the moving; and above all, the planned new location must fulfill the needs to carry out the assigned mission as previously described in this chapter. The moving may also be done by changing the land for land without having to pay for the land. It may also be done by the method of "build up first, and move the original

site after the new site has completed its construction."
The local government has the duties to build the new site and to perform the act of moving for the original uses.

More work is to be done in sorting out the land used by the military. The Ministry of Finance has published the rules "on sorting out the national and non-private land illegally occupies by users". The military should give back the government the land which have no further military needs. If the military needs do still exist, and the land happens to be obstacles to the city development plan, then the city development plans have to be requested to detour according to the following principles:
Military Land Occupied by Other Government
(1)
Agencies (a)
If the military land have been used by officials or public agencies, the military has to ask them to return the land, but if the land can be loaned, or given to the other official agencies, then the act of doing so must be well documented between the military and the users. The former has to tell the latter, and the latter has to perform the former process of receiving the loan or the donation.

(b)
If by laws, the land cannot be lent or given away, the military units concerned should ask the users to clear away the constructions on the land and return them to the military.

(2)
Military land occupied by governmental business agencies and by private people.

Military units concerned should ask the
(a) 
occupiers to return the land after moving away the construction on there.

(b) 
If over the time as asked by the military, the units concerned should sue the occupiers by law.

c.

The military units concerned should take the initiative to participate in the local government's board of city development for presenting the military views and direct dialogue with the local governments to solve any problems. By article 27 of the "City Development Law", any modification of the city development law to retain military uses should be expedited.

# Funding

## I . The Ppb System Of The Defense

The requirement of budget for defense is huge, but the given resource and budget are only limited. To effectively manage the defense budget, the MND adopted the planning, programming, and budgeting system (PPBS) in 1975. This system makes the planning, programming and budgeting interlocked logically together, while any contingency can also be met. It is illustrated briefly as in Table 3-4.

## 1. Planning

Planning is based on the missions, threats of the enemy, and our own strategic concept. Force requirement is thus formulated. Manpower, resource, science and technology should also be considered. "Build-up Concept",
"Force Restructuring Plan", and "Combat Readiness Plan" are then drawn.

2.

## Programming

A five-year financial plan is made to include the annual program for implementation. To meet any possible

1996 National Defense Report contingency, a wartime plan should also be made.

## 3. Budgeting

Based on the five-year financial plan, an annual program is drawn according to the appropriation of budget by the Executive Yuan. The "Executive Plan & Budget of Fiscal Year" and "Budget (War Time) of Fiscal Year" have to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan to be scrutinized. After the legal process of authorization, it will be then openly published and executed. To implement the PPBS is a forward-looking and continuous work; the whole idea of the system is planning goals before the programming.

Programming the budgeting, in turn, supports the planning and programming. The system interlocks the national objectives , military strategy , force structure, and allocation of resources. It is also a top-down process in policy making and resource management. Authorities will then be delegated to each echelon for execution. The PPBS has been proved to be a good way for managing the resource and budget for the Armed Forces.

## Ii . Budget Execution Of The Fiscal Years 1994 And 1995

The budgets of FY1994 and FY1995 had been well used. The regulation published by the Executive Yuan, known as "points to be observed by the Central Government and various agencies in the uses of the budget", have been observed by the MND. The MND also lays emphasis on the spirit of legitimacy and austerity in the use of budget. In the courseof administrating the budget, the MND made the regular supervision, controlling the progress of events, group-review meetings, and timely solving of the difficulty.

1.

As a result, more than 80% of the budgeting program has been well executed as demanded by the Legislative Yuan.

As to the FY1994, the MND had administrated a budget of NT $ 258,483,629,000, of which NT $ 250,026,520,443 had been audited (96. 73%) to be correct payment, NT $
5,129,154,711 to be problematic (1.98%), 
NT $
255,155,675,154 to be audited expenditure (98.71%) with only NT$ 3,327,953,846 to be the remaining balance
(1.29%).

As to the FY1995, the MND administrated a budget of 2.

NT $ 252,257,979,000, of which NT $ 243,657,253,047 had been audited (96.59%) to be correct payment, NT$
3,937,684,757 to be problematic ( 1. 56% ), NT $
247,594,937,804 (98.15%) to be audited expenditure with only NT$ 4,663,041,196 to be the remaining balance
(1.85%).

## Ii . Fy1996 Defense Budget 1. The Procedure

The procedure of formulating budget estimate is illustrated in the accompanying chart. In recent years, the government wants to expedite some major projects and to push forward the social welfare program, and at the same time the government wants to tighten the expenditure and payment; the MND, therefore, has to go along this tendency. There are three working groups, namely the personnel cost group, the operation and maintenance
(O&M) group, and the military investment group in the Based on the annual budget estimate as given to the MND by the Executive Yuan and the spirit of zero-base budget system, the MND then makes out the five-year financial plans and tries services annual priorities list. The authorized annual budget will then be decided after the approval of the Legislative Yuan (see Table 3-5).

![152_image_0.png](152_image_0.png)

The Procedure of Defense Budgeting Table 3-5 

## 2. Defense Budget

a.

For the FY1996, defense budget amounts to NT
$ 258,336,911,000, which is 22. 76% of the total national budget, NT$1,134,829,082,000 ( 1.1* trillion). To compare with the defense budget which was 24. 51% of the total national budget, 1.75% has been reduced. It is now 3.56% of the GDP as compared

with the FY1995, which was 3.81%; defense budget has been reduced by 0.25% of the GDP. We may say that the defense budget is descending every year.

Military budget can be divided into military investment and military maintenance (Chart 3-4).

Chart 3-4 Defense Budget Structure, FY1996

![153_image_1.png](153_image_1.png)

![153_image_0.png](153_image_0.png)

64.47%

## (1) Military Investment:

The allocated budget for military investment is NT
$ 91,795,681,000, which accounts for 35.53% of the total. Items of investment include weaponry, projects of military infrastructure, science research and equipment, and non-business cyclical funds.

The b.

invested amount is estimated in accordance with the contracts signed. In the recent years, however, because the government is a bit tight in budget, national budget is cut to a substantial extent, and some governmental projects are thus delayed. To buffer the impact of the above-mentioned situation on the set goal of force build-up, every planned project , such as term of contracts, schedule of completion, reservation of budget from the previous fiscal year, and fiscal year ability of execution, are well assessed at the early stage of annual budgeting. In 1996, which is the critical year for the ROC´s force build-up, military budget is expected to reach an all-time high because various projects of weapon development and infrastructure construction are near completion.

Military Upkeep:
(2)
The basic budget for the maintenance of military operation is NT $ 166, 541, 230, 000, accounting for 64.47% of the total. It includes the following two items:
(a) 
Operations Maintenance:
The budget for operations maintenance is NT$ 50,973,209,000, which accounts for 19.73% of the total. The running expenses for operation maintenance include supply and repair, educational ·
training, operation exercise, mobilization business, and service support. The running expenses for operation maintenance in FY1996 are intended for the elevation of military education level, the training of special skills, and the

replacement of new and old weapons. Personnel Upkeep:
(b)
The budget for personnel upkeep is NT$
115,568,021,000, which accounts for 44.74% of the total. This is the expense required for the payment of salary, insurance, and grants to military officers, soldiers, as well as civilian employees. For the past few years, expense for personnel maintenance has been growing due to the fact that defense budget keeps decreasing while the raise of personnel salaries keeps going on annually.

For instance, from 1992 to 1996, defense budget of NT $ 262,316,039,000 has been reduced to NT $ 258,336,911,000. The personnel maintenance expenses for the same period of time have also been cut by 22,565,420,000, but another addition of NT $ 38,453,250,000 is required for the raise of salary for the military, public servants, and teachers. As a result, the personnel maintenance expenses from 1992 to 1996 still increases by NT $
15,887,830,000.

Charts 3-5 and 3-6 show the military investment for the c.

sake of military units as well as air control, sea control, anti-landing control, and battle support.  .

# Research And Development

## I . Development Of Defense Technology

The military modernization has to rely on the military R&D. Since the establishment of the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology in 1969 by the Ministry of National Defense in response to the need for the research and development of defense technology, many talents for the sophisticated R&D work have been well cultivated, so are the tools and facilities of the Institute. It has been intended objectives of the Institute to go through the reverse engineering to the creative invention, to break through and to arrive at the world advanced level in science and technology .

## 1. The Policy

To build up independently the national defense, the policy for current phase of R&D is to attain the principles of
" underpinning, integration, interchangeability, and continuity". The whole national capabilities have to be integrated. Military R&D has to merge with that of the private sectors, to upgrade the whole national capabilities.

In peacetime, private sector 's capabilities are to be

strengthened, so that, in wartime, they can be mobilized for military production.

## 2. The Implementing

a.

The aviation development center has been planned to be gradually transferred to the private industries for the sake of using the international and in-country private resources. This is the policy decided by the government. In the meantime, the high performing capacity of the center is being well preserved.

b.

A "Non-business Revolving Fund" has been allocated in the aviation development center for supporting the governmental policy of " promoting the economic growth and encouraging the private investment". The military will participate in the interministries and private major projects on scientific and technological development in effectively using the abundant talents.

The Executive Yuan is planning to set up the
"transportation center of the Asian Pacific region" in which, the "material science and chemical division",
" electronic division ", " precision mechanics ", and
"aeronautical and space division" will be included and combined to form a "manufacturing center". It might follow the model of the "industrial park". The MND
will cooperate to implement it.

The MND has mapped a " defense science and c. d.

technology development program" which is based on the governmental "science and technology development program ". The MND is coordinating with other ministries to set up a "board for development of the defense science and technology" to further unite the academic and industrial sectors to promote the progress of the whole national development of science and technology.

## 3. The Achievement

- a.

Cooperation with Academic Sectors: Publication on the result of the "defense science and technology cooperation" is being used by the academic and industrial sectors as a kind of beneficial feedback to the society. Twenty-six universities or colleges have been entrusted to study on "aviation technology",
"electronics and information", "chemistry and material science", in 26 main topics or 421 sub-topics, spending some NT $ 370 million. The resultant data are being used directly by the military main and forward-looking development plans.

Cooperation between the Military and Industries b.

In some major "foreign procurement projects", the military would try to obtain industrial cooperation with the foreign manufacturers. In 1994, a "Non-business Revolving Fund for the Common Uses Shared by the Civilians" was set up, in order to promote the domestic technical know-how for increasing the national defense productivity.

c.

Reorganization of the Aviation Development Center:
On May 16, 1995, the Legislative Yuan after three readings passed a bill of changing the " aviation development center" to "Hanxiang Aviation Industrial Company, Ltd." with the intent of realizing the policy

d.

of developing the national aviation and space industry as well as leading all the other domestic industries.

Fund for the Common Uses Shared by the Military and Civilians :
Foundation on the development of science and technology for the common uses by the military and civilians: The Executive Yuan, on February 18, 1994, approved the use of NT $ 100 million in FY1995 by the Chungshan Institute to be shared with the civilians in the development of science and technology which can be commonly used. In 1994, Chungshan Institute was entrusted by the Ministry of Economy to work on six projects, with a budget of about NT $ 803 million, by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications on seven projects with a budget of about NT $ 102 million; in 1995, the Ministry of Economy preliminarily approved 12 projects with NT $ 1,128 million; with the Ministry of of Transportation and Communications approved 13 projects with NT $ 126 million. The Chungshan Institute is also working on projects from the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Justice and Nuclear Commission.

## 4. Outlook

a. The military will more openly seek the joint efforts from academic and industrial sectors in the development of defense science and technology.

b.

Chungshan Institute will let go some parts of its capacities, except that of "special defense technology" to the civilian uses with the intent of upgrading the

level of manufacturing, which is the policy of the government to revitalize the economic growth.

c.

Keeping pace with the given task of setting up a
"manufacturing center for the Asian Pacific region",
depending upon the feasibility studies on and 
"Chungshan Industrial Park", steps will be taken to readjust the organization of Chungshan Institute.

d .

The strategy of defense technology development must be timely reviewed and adjusted with a view to the improvement of the new-generation weaponry and specific defense technology.and maintaining a level of high technology.

## Ii . R & D On The Military Main Weapon Systems

In recent years, by the cooperation between the Chungshan Institute, Combined Service Force, and other public and private factories, some conspicuous results have been attained; such as

## 1. An-Shiang Project

## Tian-Kung (Sky-Bow) Project

a.

Tian-kung (Sky-bow) project: since 1981, the MND has decided to start the development of Tian-kung weapon system by our own effort. The Army GHQs was designated to form a controlling office for supervising the Chungshan's R&D of the project. By September 1989, the first set of Tian-kung weapon system was turned over to the Army for operational evaluation, that was the first phase of its development. The second phase would be to improve Tian-kung, based on any defects that might be found in the first phase. The second phase is now in progress.

The first set of Tian-kung I air defence missile was b.

deployed in September 1993. The system can defend against many batches of attack simultaneously. They are being deployed as planned and will replace part of the existent air defence missile system.

## 2. 3. Kuang-Hua I Project

The MND has tried for co-production of highperforming combatant ships with either U.S. or European yards in vain because of international (political) situation.

In 1987, the U.S. agreed to provide technical assistance to produce frigates with ASW, air-defense and surface antiship missiles in Taiwan. ROC Navy is responsible for managing the project, while the China Ship Building is responsible for building the platforms and the Chungshan Institute for integration of battle systems. The construction of the first ship was started in January 1990. By early 1996, three ships Cheng-gong, Chen-he, Jee-kwan, and Yue-fei had been completed.

## 134 4. Kuang-Hua Ⅲ  Project

This is a project which invites the academic, industrial and ship design experts to work together to design and build 500 tons patrol vessels. The very first vessel - "Jin-jiang" - was commissioned in December 1994. The follow-up constructions are in progress. These vessels are good for harbor defense and coastal reconnaissance. They are also pioneering work in getting the civilian industries to support the defense industry.

![168_image_0.png](168_image_0.png)

## 1996 National Defense Report 5. Shiung-Feng Project

In 1975, the MND for sea control purpose, appointed Chungshan Institute to develop a semi-automatic homing, anti-ship missile. In 1983, the MND urged Chungshan Institute to further its work on automatic homing, sea skimming anti-ship missile. The navy general headquarters
(GHQs) also set up a controlling office for the project.

Shiung-feng I has completed the production and has been deployed. Shiung-feng II has been tested and evaluated.

They are being produced for combat-ready use.

## 6. R & D Of Conventional Weapons :

To develop self-supporting national industry for the mission of military build-up and combat readiness, all the manufacturing factories of the Combined Service Force team up with the tactics consultation groups of the three forces in the research and development of military equipment and material. The products been developed so far include: 9mm pistol, XT-86 combat rifle, 5. 56mm machine gun for squad units, night vision binoculars, and 20mm multiple gun. The development of new combat rifles and other more advanced military equipment will be continued in the future to meet the demand for the build-up of second-generation forces.

The purpose of R&D is to keep on advancing and to prevent work from being obsolete. It is mandatory for survival. The administrative work needs modernizing all the time. How to improve the efficiency, method of business management, and how to make it more convenient for the people are also the important point for R&D. The MND has the intent to innovate the whole administrative job.

To be original, renew, and to get work done are the aims of the MND. To find out the problem, to storm the individual and collected brains are the job of R&D for the sake of elevating the working efficiency.

a.

Scope for the R&D

weapons, equipment and training.

## B. Procedures:

The GHQs of the three military services, their subordinate major command and units directly under the MND are to outline the items which are considered important to undergo R&D process. The various staff departments under the chief of general staff are to outline similar items based on their findings which they obtain from their inspecting various military establishments. These outlines will generate a plan known to be "R&D of job" after the approval of these plans. Then the actual studies will be carried out. Result :
By using analytical method and group-discussion on the problems of job improvement, recommendations are then made. In 1994,39 job items were outlined, 111 studies papers were produced. In 1995, there were 148 papers studying on 70 items. Other studies on 217 items, produced 109 papers.

Achievement and Application :
Out of 198 papers, the committee of R&D of jobs, evaluated and chose 20 best ones. The Executive Yuan selected a few research papers to be the prize-winning essays for the year 1994. They were: " computerassisted control of the budget and material system for the project An-shiang " ( IDF related ), "relations between noise measuring, controlling, and their damage on hearing", "purchasing of medical supplies by automatic fax system" which save time, manpower, c.

d.

and inventory level. These prize-winning essays recognition in an international medical convention held in Indonesia in July 1994. Other medical studies on medical cures, and other instruments, system for remote-curing consultation proved to be contribution to medical science and benefit the patients.

## 3. Outlook

a.

More assignment and cooperation will be made with the civilian R&D facilities.

b.

To suit the rapid changes of the world situation and to meet the needs of the military, more studies will be conducted to assist the decision makers in choosing a better option.

C.

d.

To improve the public relations with the people and to make it easier for the people who need making complaints to the military, ways of contacting with each other have to be further improved.

To further increase the fighting capabilities of the Armed Forces, the R&D work will be continued, and the result will be followed up by tracing, controlling, supervising, and periodic inspection.

# Military Mobilization

## I . Policy Of Military Mobilization

The R.O.C.'s policy of mobilization is to "build up the war complement, reinforce the fighting forces, and replace casualties and attrition loss ". In peacetime, the mobilization mission is to test the muster, to train the draftees in order to realize "the instant mobilization and immediate fighting capabilities in war time".

## Ii . Organization And Training Of The Reserve 1. Organization

Small Group of Reserve Forces a.

There are some 3.8 million troops in the reserve. The smallest unit is the "small group" which belongs to the village. Going upwards, it will be the town, county and city. An advisory center is formed to take charge of the work in managing all "small groups" in each level. Requirement of Mobilization b.

Annually, there will be about 800,000 to one million personnel in reserve for testing "the muster" to ensure

mobilization for war can be realized.

с.

Reserve Forces in Control Zone Apart from the above-mentioned reserve forces who might be called out for war, the rest are organized into
"reserve battalions", which goes also by residential registration for protection of their towns or their production. They are the manpower for sustaining the war effort.

## 2. Training

a.

## Muster For Training

This manpower which might be called up in war time is to be mustered each year for refreshing training, to enable them to be able to join the war. In 1995,58,000 men were called up for muster and training. For 1996, an estimated number of 100,000 men will be called up.

Muster Call b.

The purpose of muster call is to upkeep the habit of
"reporting immediately upon being called", and to check the up-to-date accuracy of the reserve data.  How to simplify the call-up procedure, and to review the workload as well as how to make it more convenient for the people are being studied from time to time. In 1995, 762,000 men had been called up with 757,000 men actually reported instantly. The reporting rate was 99%. In 1996, about 800,000 men will be called up.

# Education Of Patriotism And Assistance To Troops

## I . To Fortify The Faith Of Officers And Men 1. Education Of Patriotism

The purpose of promoting patriotism in the Armed Forces is to enhance esprit de corps of all military personnel. The scope of this education covers nationalism, loyalty, philosophy, morality, correct social relationships, and the four classical teachings. There is also emphasis on national defense, the five pillar-faith, democracy and constitution, international environment, anti-communism and national unification. A TV program known as "Ju-Kuang Patriotism Education" (which is aired for 90 minutes every Thursday and Saturday morning, and in the afternoon every Friday, is broadcasted by CTS ). In addition to television programming, there are various lectures with visual aids, including tape recordings, movies, etc. Special libraries containing good reading materials, are being provided to the troops for broadening their knowledge, influencing good conduct, and enhancing their leisure time while also maintaining loyalty, unity, solidarity, and efficiency.

There have been 10,623 lectures conducted for promoting the above goals.

## 2. Active Communication With The Populace

In recent years, The Ministry of National Defense, in order to gain the support of public opinion, has used television programming radio broadcasting, newspapers, and other mass media, including press conferences, seminars, and public speaking to explain defense activities which are of interest to the public. The Ministry also listens to public opinion. In doing so, national security and the public understanding of the military are promoted.

Ju-Kuang Patriotism Education (TV Lecture)

## 174 Improving The Leadership And Supporting The Troops Of All Levels Ii .

It has always been important in military administration to improve the leadership and support for troops of all levels.

The draftees come from the people. Most of them are lawabiding people with a good sense of duty and discipline.

They are willing to receive the training and obey the military regulations. Nevertheless, there are some draftees who have been documented bad conduct in their civilian life before joining the military (In 1995, there were 12, 032 draftees who had criminal records prior to joining the services. This amounts to 8.58% of the draftees). There were some who were spoiled by their parents, and who had difficulty in dealing with social relations. These draftees could not adapt themselves to the military discipline. There are also some lower echelon officers who are inexperienced in leadership and are not patient in dealing with the problems arising from the difficult draftees. The Ministry of National Defense, reviewing the whole problem and seeking for overall improvement, has called for group studies, conducted by key cadres, company leaders, retired veterans, scholars and experts to draft a handbook on
"Personnel Management in the Field Units"(a draft) which is being tested since December 1995 by the three military services. Revisions are to be made after the six month experiment. The handbook stresses the following points:
Teaching the cadres and helping them understand the a.

importance and purpose of good leadership, and ways 1.

of looking after the troops, and providing them with new attitude, as well as methods to train and look after their men.

b.

Define the proper way of looking after their men, contacting their families, educating and training the troops, making sure the men understand how to make complaints and when to seek guidance. The lowerechelon officers must well know how to deal with the wounded and casualties; how to support and consult with men in difficulties; and also know the standards of punishment for offenders.

Visit the family of new draftees, make inquiries to c.

 
determine their opinions, watching carefully their training, and dealing with any problem situation properly in a timely manner.

d.

Coordinating with the conscription officers of the county, municipal and provincial governments to conduct social events among the members of the draftees' families, and communicating and getting acquainted with their ideas.

2.

In order to enable commanding officers on all echelons to well understand the concept of the draft on "Personnel Management in the Field Units", the Ministry of National Defense has organized a special visiting group (consisting of generals and admirals) to conduct seminars in late January 1996 at many military bases to find out any special difficulties and constraining factors on the problem, and to improve the above-mentioned situation and resolve problems at the working levels with common sense and fairness.

## Ii . Assistance For Psychological Hygiene

In the past two years, six documents have been published together with the "Handbook on the Assistance of Psychological Health". Two educational videocassettes on "psycho-hygienics",
and one handbook on "things you need to know about psychohygienics for the Armed Forces" were published. Seminars and demonstrations have also been conducted. In October, 1994, "the Institute for Psychological Studies" from Taiwan University and National Chengchi University were entrusted to study "prevention of self-damage in the Armed Forces" based on data from the draftees' families and the military units. In each divisional headquarters, there are psychiatrists assigned to take care of the

psychological problems of the troops. Starting from January 1, 1994, there have been 70, 432 cases treated by qualified psychiatrists. This helps the troops at working echelons. To improve the use of the given resources and hygienics in the field, feasibility studies are being carried out to establish the "MND
Center for Psychological Hygiene " or " Local Center for Psychological Hygiene".

## Reports On Personal Property Iv .

In September, 1993, based on the laws described in the Law of " Property Claim by Civil Servants " and " the Detailed Regulations of Property Claim by Civil Servants", the MND
completed the report work of officers requiring the declaration of property holding of major generals and rear admirals, who possess the official chops of "Chief of Unit". After September 1,1994, 5,691 of these officers reported their personal property. It included the officers who had served in the capacity of Supervision on the Integrity, comptroller and audit, finance, construction and procurement. These personnel are also selected randomly for further evaluation; and their reports are being reported to the public. (So far there have been seventy-seven cases examined by the public, and none of these reports have been accused to be false. )

## V . Improving Assistance Service To Military Personnel Assistance And Help Given To Officers And Men In Emergency 1. 2. More Leisure Time Facility

Benevolent and relief fund are to be given to officers and men in emergency situation. In 1995 and 1996, a budget of NT $ 139,500,000 and NT $ 124,480,000 were allocated for the relief and help to officers and men harmed on duty
(NT$ 600,000 for war death, NT $ 500,000 for death on duty or first degree of injuries ). The provincial and municipal governments have the equivalent funds for the same purpose. In each railway station, there are the "R.T. O. or Service Offices" where officers and men can obtain emergency assistance in need. Each railway station has a revolving fund of NT $ 30,000 to NT $ 100,000 for the relief of officers and men who may be in short of traveling or accommodation fund, or their family members who are sick or in need of quick relief . They may receive up to NT $
2,000, and are required to repay the debt within two weeks.

As of December 1995, there have been 1,986 cases of applying for these funds totalling NT$ 2,334,400 which did render help to officers and men in need.

To improve the leisure time facility and upgrade the quality of lives for officers and men, there are 165 leisure time centers equipped with large-size TV screen, and also inside the barracks, there are large centers containing all the amusement equipment (For the off-shore islands, there are

## 1996 National Defense Report 3. Services Rendered To The Families Of The Draftees

The services provided assist families in cases of sickness, visiting to the draftees' families, consulting their families in the problems of disciplinary matters, as well as legal assistance to the draftees' families who may be involved with lawsuits. At the time the draftees report for duties, they and their families will be briefed on their rights and benefits. Within three days of the draftees' joining, the officers in charge of their units are to call their families by telephone, and tell their faes about their life in the military services. Upon the conclusion of the recruiting training, the records of their life, work, learning performance will be sent to the soldiers' service stations of their hometowns or the stations to make contact with their families. The Ministry of Interior also has a fund available for making the similar services to the draftees. The following Table 5-1 shows the numbers of services offered to the dependents of the enlisted personnel in 1994 and 1995.

## 182 Vi . Renewal Of Old Dependent Quarters

1.

Most dependent quarters which were built some forty years ago are in poor condition. The MND in 1980 had made a rule of "Points for Trials in the Renewal of All Dependent Housing". The rule, however, was only an executive order and caused some disputes regarding its legitimacy.

Additionally, the lands on which the military housing were built may not have been government property, or which were not planned for housing in the city building plan, but because of low prices, were sufficient for the fund of renewal after being sold. The MND, therefore, in 1995 invited the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Justice, Secretariat of the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Audit and Economic Development and Planning Council to jointly study the problem and formulate
"Regulations for Rrebuilding Deteriorated Quarters for Military Dependents ", which has been passed by the Legislative Yuan after three readings. The essence of the rule is as follows:
To carry out the renewal plan, the old quarters or the a.

government property belonging to the military which finds no further uses of the land, can be used for building houses in a new community, or to be used otherwise.

The original dwellers of the houses have the right to b.

buy the renewed houses built under this plan, and the right to receive monetary aid for buying the said houses. The original military personnel who stayed in

the houses but are now deceased can be taken by their spouses, but not others. But after the passing of this law , if the parents who were dwellers of the house were found to have died, the right of stay in the new-built houses can be passed on to their children.

c.

New suitable sites which are compatible to the existent quarters for renewal, should be chosen for building the new houses, as part of a centralized community. Lands which have no more military uses or newly-bought property for the purpose of building new military houses can also be used.

![219_image_0.png](219_image_0.png)

Ground-breaking Ceremony for the Construction of the First Da-peng Community
d.

e.

If the original dependents have to pay a portion of the housing cost, the total payment should not exceed 20% of the total price of the house and the land.

The original dwellers may also choose to leave and sell the houses to the military.

f.

If three quarters of the number of original dwellers agree to the renewal plan, then the houses of the rest of the dwellers who don´t agree with the renewal plan can be taken away by the authority, and they must leave the dwelling after the cases have been judged by the local court.

According to the compensation standards established by g. 

local governments for the removal of public construction, the quarters or residences illegally built in obsolete camps, once reconstructed or disposed, can receive the compensations from the renewal foundation for tearing and moving. The dwellers can buy the newly-built residence at the cost price. In addition, by submitting a request to the governments of Taiwan province (cities) and counties (cities) for application of "Regulations of Civilian Residence", they can also receive a loan with favorable interest rates.

h .

The owners of the residence appropriated can not sell, pawn, or exchange the residence and the land for the duration less than five years on the date he obtains the ownership, but the ownership legally inherited is excluded.

2.

According to statistics, there are a total of 803 quarters, of which 272 quarters have been rebuilt, moved, or repaired.

Twenty-six quarters are partially re-constructed. There are

522 quarters for 73,000 families waiting to be rebuilt. A "Committee for the Promotion of Rebuilding Deteriorated Quarters" has been formed by the MND. The renewal plans are estimated to be completed within 5-6 years. During this period, there may be 15,000 to 20,000 families whose houses will be renovated. But, nevertheless, the whole plan w needs the cooperation from all the dependents who should consider their total benefits.

## I . Revision Of The Personnel Regulations

1.

Formulation of "Regulations on the Service of Officers and NCOs of the Army, Navy, and Air Force To coordinate with the execution of the "reform on the project of retirement and benefit for the military, civil servants and teachers", the MND has newly formulated the
"Regulations on the Service of Sfficers and NCOs of the Army, Navy, and Air Force". Basing on the principles of
"reasonable standard of payment and benefit for the military personnel, and that of the simplification of the defense rules and regulations", the new set of regulations has been passed by the Legislative Yuan and signed by thesident into law, which contains the following points:
Shortening the Length of Service of the Voluntary a.

Officers and NCOs:
The original ten years of service has now been changed to a minimum length of six years for officers and four years for NCOs.

b.

Increase the Retirement Pay Scales:
The old rule set the original salary as one basic counting

point. This is now changed to double the salary as one basic counting point. But, on account of the fact that the military forces have to be kept young, the servicemen, therefore cannot enjoy the same benefits as civil servants to stay on duties for thirty-five years. The military rules now set in this manner: every year after the minimum length of service year will be counted as 0.5 basic point for calculating the retirement pay once for all. The maximum multiplier is up to ten basic points.

c.

Legalize All the Subsidized Pays:
ﺎﻧﯽ Legalize all the subsidized pay, such as subsidy for living expenses, educational subsidies for children, pensions as paid, and the difference of bank interest between the contemporary rate and the favorable rate for the deposits of military personnel will all be covered by law to protect military personnel.

d.

Monthly Pay for the Pensioners:
If the officers and NCOs have served for more than 20 years before retirement , they are entitled to receive the monthly pay (as opposed to one time lump sum payment). They will also receive more counting points in the long run.

e.

Make Compensations in Accordance with the Pay Structure for Civil Servants and Teachers:
To make compensation pay compatible with civil servants and teachers, on July 1, 1970, there was a readjustment of the pay structure for military, civil servants, and teachers.

In that structure, civil servants and teachers received
"retirement pay and also some immediate cash". However,

at the time of readjustment, there was no exact scale of compensation established, and the military did not get the same compensation. It has been calculated by the Executive Yuan and the Examination yuan that 15% of the original monthly pay should be counted as one basic point. So the military personnel will be given with that amount. It is estimated that there will be 400,000 active and retired personnel who will get the said amount, except for those who retire before June 30, 1970, because they have already received the said compensation (see Table 5-2).

## Revise The "Death Bereavement Funds"

Most people thought the "death bereavement funds" were too little for the dependents to survive. The MND, therefore, is now revising the old scale to increase the funds
(It was the original salary, now it will be doubled the original salary). The length of time for bereavement funds will also be extended. The newly suggested rules have been sent to the Legislative Yuan for approval.

## 3. Formulate The Regulations On The Bereavement Funds For The Self-Defense Members Of Kinmen And Matsu Area

"The Regulations on the Bereavement Funds for the Selfdefense Members of Kinmen and Matsu Area" is based on Article 14-3-2 of the "Regulations on Security and Assistance of the Dead and Wounded in Kinmen, Matsu, Pratas and Spratly Islands " which establishes that " before the termination of military administration of Kinmen and Matsu, the bereavement funds for the dead and wounded of the self-defense force are to be paid by the MND at the same scale as other military personnel". The MND has now formulated a new regulation on the bereavement fund which has been approved by the Executive Yuan on August 15, 1995, which will become effective in 1996, and contains the following points:
Those who qualify for these new rules are, before the a.

termination of the military administration in Kinmen and Matsu, dead or wounded in war or on duties

(between October 25, 1949 to November 7, 1992).

b. 

A one time payment of two basic points of up to 149 points those self-defense forces who die in war. for Those who died or were wounded on duties, a one-time payment of one basic point of up to 113 points (This is counted by the payment of voluntary petty officers or sergeants plus two allowance for the year 1996).

c.

:
d.

The beneficiary of those who are entitled to receive the bereavement funds should identify himself or herself to the Fu-jian provincial government with legal documents supporting their case. The application will then be transferred to the Combined Service Force for payment.

Standards for types of casualties, verification, and order of the beneficiaries will be the same as that of other military personnel.

## 4 . Revision Of The "Selection And Service Of Reserve Officers From College Graduates"

Since 1988, the old regulations have been observed. But, due to the fact that billets of the armed forces have been reduced, and the numbers of student graduates with MA,
MS, or Ph. D. have increased, it is, therefore, decided that, instead of assigning the students with MA or MS
degrees as reserve officers, they are now eligible to go through the examination to qualify for reserve officers status. Those students who have obtained PhDs will be selected as reserve officers. To maintain the fairness ofconscription law, a joint declaration of the new revision was published by the Ministries of National Defense, Interior and Education.

## 5. Ease Up The Regulations On The Age Limits Of Military Enlistment For The Youth Who Go Abroad For Education

There will be no restrictions on the ages 16-18 eligible for military service to apply for going abroad for education.

The restrictions have been loosened to allow young people to go abroad to attend college or junior college, as well as to obtain a MA, MS, or Ph. D. degree. These students can extend the visa on their passport up to the age of 24, 27, and 30, depending on the level of degree (undergraduate, master, or doctoral) they are seeking. They must return to Taiwan before December 31 of the year when they reach their respective age limit. They can come home for leave no more than two times per year, and not exceeding a total of four months. When they apply for leave again, there is no need to acquire a permit from the conscription affairs authority .

## Ii . Multiple Sources Of Recruiting Officers And Ncos 1. Recruit Officers From Various Sources

The MND, for the sake of fulfilling the need of obtaining military cadres and persuading fine young men to apply admission into military academies to serve for the country, has improved the working environment, and improved education and advancement opportunities. The following measures are taken in order to assist recruiting officers :
.

a.

Adopt the American system of Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC). Scholarship money would be given to the high-performance sophomores, if they are willing to become reserve officers after graduation.

b.

:
A two-year technical class would be set up in the military basic educational college to recruit the graduates from the civilian vocational schools. This would provide further studies and employment of the graduates from vocational schools and give the BA/BS
degree opportunities for military officers.

c.

As required, young students graduating from high school may also be admitted directly into the military academies based upon the scores they receive in the national joint examination for entering university to reduce the duplication of examinations.

2.

## Use Of More Female Officers And Ncos

Using women in noncombatant duties is a main trend in many foreign countries. The armed forces in 1995 admitted 140 females into services. Since 1992, there have been four groups of admissions, totaling 3,728 females (1,389 officers and 2,339 NCOs). The graduates from the first and second classes have been assigned to offices, schools, hospitals, arsenals, warehouses, army corps and wings of air forces which have fixed geographic locations. In line with the "ten years force strength training",
thosaduates of the third class will be appointed to the divisional SQs headquarters. Some of the graduates on their own accord, have been assigned to duties on the offshore islands. It has been three years since the female programs started. The evaluations are turning out to be affirmative.

## Improving The Ncos System

NCOs are the backbone of the Armed Forces, and the foundation of the operating echelon. The NCOs who came to Taiwan from mainland China have now retired. As the society in Taiwan becomes more prosperous with good chances of getting employment, it is now difficult to get enough permanent NCOs, whose ratio in the Armed Forces has become too low, especially when the weapons system have become more complex. It is hard to maintain a sophisticated weapon system in top efficient statusout having enough good NCOs. Of the most urgent jobs is how to improve the NCOs system.

Content of the NCOs System a.

Well defined the Duties of the NCOs
(1)
The chief function of officers is to lead and to plan

## 3.

196

![231_image_1.png](231_image_1.png)

the work. The NCOs, under the leadership of the officers, are to carry out the work. They are complementary to each other. Based on this concept , a table shows the functions of officers and NCOs has been published in accordance with the characteristics of each unit; NCO committees in battalions and companies have been set up to enable the NCO to carry out the actual work in battalions and companies under the leadership of officers.

(2)
Adjust the Structure of NCOs Complements In coordinating with the Armed Forces' readjustment, the ratio of officers, NCOs, private soldiers, will be adjusted in three phases. Reduce the billets of officers, while increase that of the NCOs, in order to get an ideal ratio in time. In the first phase, 1,606 battalion chief NCOs, 4,020 company chief NCOs will be set up; and chief warrant officers will be set up in high command posts, making more promotion spaces for the NCOs.

Providing Sound Education for the NCOs
(3)
(a)
The length of classes for NCOs education should be extended from 2.5 years to 3.5 years. Two years´special courses should be established for admitting graduates from senior high schools.

In the various branch schools, regular and advanced courses should be edited, as well as classes for foreign languages training.

(b)

Those NCOs serving in high command posts as
(c)
well as the NCOs instructors should be given higher studies. They should be motivated to study in universities at home and abroad.

(4)
Upgrade NCOs Pay and Welfare Gradually, year by year, the pay and welfare of the NCOs should be upgraded; the goal is to give pay to the master sergeants equal to that of majors or lieutenant colonels, to give pay to the sergeants equal to that of lieutenants or captains.

(ટે) 
Build up Respect for the NCOs Redesign the uniforms of NCOs, give leave time and leisure facilities in a more respective manner.

## B. Procedure For Execution

Amendment of the Related Regulations:
(1) 
Complete the legal procedure by going through the Legislative Yuan on the "Rules of Commissioning the Officers & NCOs in the Army, Navy, and Air Force"; basing on which other related regulations will then be made to well lay down the positions, pay scale, welfare and career development for the NCOs.

Improve Education and Training:
(2) 
On the principles of "training a large number of the junior NCOs, specializing the middle-level NCOs, and keeping the high-level NCOs ".

Facilities and instructors for various classes are to be improved first in order to upgrade the quality of NCOs.

Establish the Consensus of the Importance of the
(3)
NCOs System :
The content and purpose of setting up the NCOs system have to be well known by the officers and men in the Armed Forces as well as in the society in order to change the old, bad impression of the NCOs; to make the society think highly of the NCOs and to support the new NCOs system.

## 4 . Encourage The Re-Enlistment Of The Compulsory Officers And Men

Those who want to re-enlist will be sent to various specialized training courses so that they may choose further studies. They may also be sent to universities or postgraduate schools in at home or abroad, or if they choose, they can attend the "Air University", "Air Administration School", "night classes of the colleges or universities" and obtain more knowledge. Their pay and other benefits will be the same as that of the voluntary officers and men.

## 5. Those Who Want To Shift From Compulsory To Voluntary Services Are Allowed To Ask For The Chosen Jobs

Starting from July 1, 1990, the MND has changed the length of service from 3 years to 2 years for compulsory draftees. But, the shortened length cannot satisfy the needs of the Navy and Air Force; because it has decreased the combat effectiveness of the Navy and Air Force. The Navy's specialties of sonar, missiles, radar, engineering and the Air Force's meteorology, traffic control, missiles, and electronics are required higher skills and experience.

Particularly during the current introduction of secondgeneration of ships and aircraft, the Navy and Air Force need to meet the new demands. Attention is being paid to the civilian job classification of the draftees before they join the service; the employment of women power, as well as the cooperation between civilian education and defense establishment. Graduate students from the high middle schools may be allowed to find a job, and concurrently to serve in the Armed Forces. About 3,000 persons will be enlisted into the Navy and Air Force. The MND will publish the job-descriptions, specialties, places to be served. Any high school graduate, aged 19 and unmarried, is now being called up by conscription. Those students who have not reached the age of 25, but have served in the Armed Forces can apply for this enrollment project and choose their jobs and places of service. After completing 12 weeks of basic training, they will be appointed as secondgrade sergeants. From then on, after 3 years and 3 months of service, they would get the same pay as that of voluntary services. The length of service is actually only 1.5 years longer than that of the 2-years service of the compulsory draftees, and they can enjoy the privilege of choosing the job and working places. After their retirement, they will get a handsome financial reward for running their own business.

## Iii . Re-Settlement Training Prior To Retirement

The MND is considering the overall uses of the national manpower resource. The requirement of the manpower for

the Armed Forces has to match the overall requirement of national economy. A good career transition training program prior to retirement would enable the military manpower to be transferred to the industrial and economic development. The job retraining program was started in 1992. The accompanying table 5-3 shows the number of the trainees and classes in the job re-training program.

## 1. Transition Training For The Lieutenant Colonels And Colonels

The National Federation of Industry and the National Chamber of Commerce have been entrusted to send lecturers and experts to teach in the job transition courses which include Industrial Engineering, Industrial Management, Business Management, Real Estate Management, Hotel Management and Tourism. The courses last for three months. Beginning from May 1992, there have been 2,504 officers who have taken the training courses. 82% of those receiving training obtained new jobs after retirement. The veterans sense of duty and devotion to studying new things have earned admiration from the general public.

## 2. Training On Business Management

If the captains and majors who have served in active duty after a certain length of time want to carry on their services, they may take management courses which are run by the association of small and medium businesses. The courses will be useful to the officers even after the retirement. There have been 350 officers undergoing the management courses since December 1994.

## 3. Training In Occupational Skills

The Labor Commission of the Executive Yuan is entrusted to run the occupational skill courses for officers and NCOs of the voluntary services. Any units commanded by major generals or rear admirals can recommend the officers or NCOs under their command to take the courses. The compulsory service personnel, three months before their retirement, can make their requisition for taking courses which they can attend after they retire from the services. There have been 6,909 people who have taken the courses since June, 1992.

## Verification Of The Skill Of The Officers And Men 4. 5. Recommendation For New Jobs Before Retirement

Based on the rules on job certificates as published by the Labor's Commission of the Executive Yuan, sixteen examinations have been held to test and verify the skill of officers and men since October 1993. The tests include 24 items in the skill of using lathe machines, milling and grinding machines, mechanical drawing, industrial distribution, blueprint of construction and handling of heavy mechanical gears, etc. 69% of the personnel taking the tests have obtained the qualification certificates wexcellent grades.

Hojun Head Hunting Company has been sought to find new jobs for the veterans, whose specialty and personal choices were listed in computers for matching the needs of industries and business companies. The goal is to obtain new jobs the day after retirement. Since January 1992, 44,697 persons have made their application as shown by the following Table 5-3.

# Budgeting

## I . Transparence Of The Budget

Since 1992, defense budget consists of two parts: one part is open to the public, while the other part is classified as confidential. The MND is in charge of a budget in FY1996 amounting to NT $258,336,911,000, of which NT
$ 164, 786,847,000 is to be open. The open portion is 63.

79% of the total budget which is larger than the open portion of 43.08% in 1992. More portions of the defense budget will be opened to the public in future provided it will not hurt the national security.

## Ii . Review On The Cashier Of The Defense Fund

To safeguard an effective use of the defense fund, the armed forces adopted a centralized way of managing the defense budget since 1953. The Ministry of Finance, beginning in 1970, adopted a centralized way to receive and disburse all of the central government's funds. A single point set up by the Ministry of Finance could not have met the working needs of the Armed Forces, because there is only one cashier location in Taipei set up by the Ministry of

Finance, while the Armed Forces have more than four thousand cashier location scattered throughout Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu. From the FY1996, however, the safety deposit of defense fund has been lowered from NT $ 17.6 billion to NT $ 10 billion. The defense fund will be handled in the new centralized way. Preparatory work for doing this is now in process.

## Iii. Adjusting Pay Allowance On Duties

To coordinate the pay scale of the civil servants and policy of the government, and to match the civilian and military pays, the Armed Forces will make 13 adjustments on pay as shown in table 5-4. Also the allowance given to the military personnel who serve in remote and difficult areas has been raised about 33% within the maximum financial capacity of defense budget of 1996. This increase in pay allowance was started on September 1, 1995. It will be further reviewed depending on the budgetary burden.

The purpose is to boost the morale of those who serve in the remote areas and to balance the pay scale between civil servants and that of the military.

# Operational Training

## I . Well Prepare The Combat Readiness 1. Improve Defense Operation Plans

Based on the enemy's situation and that of our own forces, the ROC must modify our defense operation plans from time to time. Carry out studies, tactical surveys, war gaming, and force projection to test and validate the existing operation plan. Insure that all the echelons know how to deal with any "surprising situation", "sudden enemy attack", and "damage limitation". Increase the ability to manage in any crisis.

## 2. More Training Exercise

Exercises can be divided into two kinds: The first kind is the routine exercise while the second kind is targeted at some assumed aggressive. The first type consists of basic training, individual training, team work training, and composite and joint operational training. The second kind of exercise is conducted with various assumptions that the enemy may impose on us. Since 1995, the MND has conducted 19 times exercises. These exercises comprise joint 

exercise of Army, Navy, and Air Force, single service exercise command post exercise, mobilization exercise, field exercise with real forces, and joint exercise with military troops and civil defense units.

## 3. Adjust The Training Field

The factors of local land development, environment and ecology, characteristics of defense of Taiwan, training mission, and frequency for using the training field all must be taken into consideration as a whole, in order to adjust the plan and uses of the land for military planning. Some small-size training fields can be moved or abandoned or shifted into a larger training field to be commonly used by

the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Sea and air spaces for training can be newly chosen. All land for training should come under overall training for land development as designated by the Executive Yuan. The governing principles are as follows:
a.

By the "overall land development plan", some smallsize combat training fields can be moved toward the low-hill areas b. 

c.

Minimize the uses of land by sharing uses of a common training field From January 1, 1994 to June 30, 1995, a training field in Swang-lian Po of Chung-li, Kwan-tian, and Hsinchung of Tainan, Feng-shan and Shou-shan of Kaohsiung, Tai-ping of Hua-lian, Ying-han of Taichung, and Lung-sheng of Kwang-shi have been moved to protect the people in proximity from being hurt by the bullets from the firing ranges. Work will be continued to protect the near-by dwellers.

## Ii . Coastal Patrol And Anti-Smuggling And Illegal Entry

Smuggling of infiltrators, weapons and drugs are causes for disorder. To prevent smuggling from being able to infiltrate the coastal lines, on the top of the countermeasures taken by the police and Military Police along the coast land, the forces of Coast Guard Command are having an important role to play. Since 1994 and 1995, the forces of the Coast Guard Command working in conjunction with the customs, police, and military have intercepted 1, 087 smuggling cases, 2,026 smugglers, 165 illegal fishing boats, 2,347 infiltrators from Mainland China, 715 cases of drug trafficking, 497 kilograms of heroin, 2,396 kilograms of

![247_image_1.png](247_image_1.png)

amphetamine (of which 2,150 kilograms are by-products).

All the unlawful cases have been sent to the legal authorities concerned.

## Ii . Protection Of Fisheries

The Armed Forces have always paid attention to the importance of protecting ROC' fisheries. Round the clock, aircraft and naval ships carry out the reconnai ssance and patrols around Taiwan and Penghu in order to protect ROC's fishing vessels. Direct radio communications have been set up between naval ships and fishing boats by allocating the appropriate radio frequency bands for quick action as it may be demanded by the fishing boats. The primary mission of the Armed Forces is the defense of Taiwan and Penghu. The armed forces do not have the status of judicial police either. Therefore, it might cause some other disputes if it is directly involved in the work of smuggling prevention. The Armed Forces are in a position to assist the 7th Security Police Battalion to repel those illegal fishing vessels which have sailed over the correct boundary. Laws concerning the territorial waters and economic zones are to be made or modified by the governmental agencies. The capabilities of the 7th Security Police Battalion are also to be enlarged. So the total concerted effort to protect the fisheries can be further extended.

# Military Education

## I . Legitimize The Military Education

Even though regulations for a national education system exist, there is no legal basis for military education.

However , the admission tests of military schools , the design of military curriculums, employment of lecturers and professors, the management of student records and academic activities, etc., have always observed the general practice of legitimate educational institutions. There are, of course, differences in educational goals and characteristics between military schools and civilian institutes. Thus the MND is working on "regulations for military education" in order to legitimize military schools and formalize the development of a knowledge base for strategic and tactical national defense requirement.

## Ii . Refine Military Education

The military education of officers is divided into three levels: basic, specialized, and advanced, while that of the NCOs' is divided into two levels basic and specialized. In order to modify force structure, in 1994 and 1995 the

education for specialized and advanced levels of officers and specialized level of NCOs have been intensified. A new logistic school was established and the "Institute for Military Science Studies" was changed into "Institute for Strategic Studies". New and intensified courses for sergeant majors were added. At the military academy, to avoid interference between the general education and military professional courses, the entire curriculum has been converted into a credit system, similar to that of the general education in civilian colleges or universities. The professional military education is intensely applied during the winter and summer vacation, and the phase of branches training.

The Regular Class of Master Sergeant

## 216 Ii . Encourage Cadres To Seek Further Studies

To improve the quality of key officers and NCOs, incentives are provided to encourage full time, part time, or on the job training, specialized courses in defense technology, procurement and other technical subjects.

Since 1995, there have been 540 officers who have been selected to attend universities abroad or in country for Master, Doctorate, or short-term studies. NCOs have been encouraged to take the extension courses at National Open university or evening classes at universities.  There are 1,500 persons enrolled for this program.

# Logistics

## I . Refine The Logistics System

1.

Based on strategic and operational requirements, the logistics system has now adopted the concept of "local logistics support ". Organization of the supply and maintenance has also been improved by shortening the flowprocess. It was started on January 1, 1995 to support the defense posture.

In conjunction with the 10-year force reduction plan, duplication of logistics structures is to be streamlined to increase efficiency. Initially it will be two tracks, one track for special items needed for each individual service, and the other track for common items. Eventually, logistics support will be conducted by a joint agency.

2.

## Ii . Elevate The Effectiveness Of Equipment

1.

Equipment for air control is of utmost importance, while anti-blockade preparation must also have the priority, decisive battle near the shore should come first. With the given budget, a tri-service priority list has to be worked out based on the objective to build up forces. Equipment is

being acquired from foreign procurement, self-production, and co-production. Equipment and fighting capability will be thus elevated.

2.

3.

At this moment of transition from the older to newer equipment, we must maintain the weapons on hand to prolong their life cycles and ensure their readiness.

"Rules on Evaluating Obsolescent Equipment " are being modified. If aircraft, ships, tanks, and any other equipment are beyond economic repair, or spare parts are very difficult to obtain, they should be de-commissioned or scrapped to reduce the cost of maintenance.

## Iii . Well Strengthen The Logistic Capability

1.

The main idea of disposing materials is "to dispose at different areas, storage in composite formation, increase in depth and go underground ". To satisfy the need to logistically support a war, it is necessary to disperse the location of depots, and warehouses at various bases, expedite our bases on the east coast, accumulate larger supplies of spare parts, components, food, and ammunition to equip the troops in the event of war.

2. Extend the civilian industrial base and scope of items to be shared by the civilian sector. In the five years of "Planning, Programming, and Budgeting System ", civilian participating in the care and maintenance of military equipment should be included.

3.

For the second generation of weapon system will be even more sophisticated, and there is a great need for higherlevel of skills to maintain and repair, improve the management information system, and upgrade the training of personnel in order to sustain combat preparedness.

# Defense Management

## I . Verification Of Investment Cases

In order to enable finite resources to achieve the maximum benefit, a system analysis committee was set up on July 1, 1995 to look at any systems acquired by the Armed Forces, with a value exceeding NT $ 500 million which can be a case of purchasing, production, R&D or construction.

The committee includes advisers, technological experts, scholars or other related academicians. The cases are to be evaluated, analyzed, and verified in one meeting instead of multiple studies to avoid a long, tedious, time - consuming process. The result of the analysis will be used for decision making in regard to each particular case of major system acquisition.

## Ii . Computerized War Gaming

Computerized war gaming is used to simulate war games, during which those factors such as the situation of the field, the rules for engagement, the forces available, the effectiveness of weapon systems employed, and the logistics capability are taken in consideration, by replacing

war games and live exercises. The functions of computerized war gaming can not only test operational planning for the commanders and staff, but also help them make evaluation combat capability, force structure, combat plannand the effectiveness of weapon systems.

Computerized war games can be repeatedly conducted with less manpower and in relative short periods of time, and they can effectively save manpower, cost, resources and time. Thus, they are of great military value and are very useful in combat testing initiatively developed by advanced nations in pursuit of military force enhancement. In view of this, the Armed Forces have developed computerized war .

gaming with near, middle and long range plans.

## Ii . Elevation Of Information Level

To keep pace with the rapid development in information science and technology, the MND has formulated guideline for promoting information science in the Armed Forces (There are nine major projects, including 48 special projects ). The strategy in the field has been prepared. It will also be coordinated with "governmental electronic document system " in order to avoid any duplication of effort and expense. Education of the information techniques is being taught in various classes of the military school and colleges to get the necessary talents and general knowledge for the officers and men.

# Electronic Communications

## I . Early Warning And Air Defense System

The automated early warning air defense system is being improved. By using advanced radar search techniques, the status in our air defense zone can be understood. The microwave digital communications under ground cable system (submerge dragon) can effectively link up with the data information in connecting with the naval automatic command and control system to form an integrated air-defense system.

## Ii . Upgrade The Quality Of Information Transmission

To satisfy the need for high quality and high speed in the transmission of data, as well as to conform with the NII
(National Information Infrastructure), the Armed Forces have planned a number of Optic Fiber Communication lines
(Taiwan-Penghu, Taiwan-Matsu-Dongyin). The Hwalian-
Taipei optic fiber line is under construction. Hualian-
Taichung will be followed, to eventually complete a roundthe-island communication network.

1996 National Defense Report

## 皿. Maritime  Commercial  Communications

Radio communications for maritime shipping will also be equipped on board naval vessels, enabling the Navy to communicate with foreign merchants and fishing ships for maritime search and rescue, identification, towing, and other necessary communications. When it is necessary to form convoys in wartime, integration with the merchant radio communications would be extremely useful.

The Construction of Optical Fiber Communication Network

## 226 Iv . Using Civil Communications In Support Of The Military In Wartime

Based on the "Regulations on The Uses and Control of Governmental and Private Communications in Taiwan Area", all the radio and cable facilities belonging to the electrical power station, police, railway, sugar industry, and forestries, can be used by the military in support of military exercises or operation in wartime.

# Medical Treatment

## I . In Connection With The National Medical Care Insurance Program

The "Law of the National Health Insurance" became effective in March 1995. Family dependents and civilian employees in the military table of organization are treated as the 4th category for medical care. To be compatible with the insurance programs established by the Executive Yuan, the Armed Forces will make a subsidy each year. In addition, in 1996 NT $1,148,308,087 has been appropriated, of which NT $ 844, 567, 087 is designated for the dependents or survivors of military deceased, and NT $ 303, 741, 700 is dedicated to dependents of laborers employed by the military. Meanwhile, the military has initiated " Regulations for the Operation of the Dependents (the survivors of the military deceased are included ) Accepting Medical Treatment in Military Hospitals in Cooperation with the Implementation of the National Health Insurance". Their health benefits are described as follows:

## Favorable Treatment For The Dependents 1.

Before the adoption of "National Health Insurance",

the  military  dependents  could go to any military hospitals free of charge, or partially charged as laid down by Article 24 of "The Favored Regulation for The Medical Care of The Military Personnel And Their Dependents ". Since the adoption of the National Health Insurance Program, the dependents can go to any specifically designated hospitals which might be more convenient to the patients, but Article 27-4 of the insurance policy says that the dependent must pay 40% of the insurance fee plus a portion of the medical costs. The MND, in order to help the dependents, is trying its best within budgetary limitations to help dependents. By that regulation, the cost to be paid by the dependents themselves are as shown in Table 5-5.

## 2. Survivors Of The Deceased Military Personnel

Those surviving dependents of deceased military personnel who are in the National Health Insurance Program, can utilize the military hospitals. They will have to pay in the same way as the other dependents. That is, the costs are taken care of by the MND.

## Ii . Anti-Drug Activities

In conjunction with the "war on drugs", a program was established by the government's anti-drug committee at division level and above for overall management of anti-drug activities. Hospitals located in the northern, southern, central, and eastern parts of Taiwan are equipped with testing stations and automatic testing instruments to carry out the urine testing and verification of people taking drugs. The work is being supported by Armed Forces General Hospital and Criminal Center of the Military Police Headquarters.

Twelve "seminars on sanitary education" have been set up to educate those military personnel who have previous records of drug usage or drug trafficking. Since 1995, there have been 1,581 persons undergoing the treatment and educational classes. Among them, only 53 persons went back to the drugs. The rate of success is 96.7%. In army hospitals 802,806, and 818, wards for drug treatment have been set up, with 102 beds augment to the insufficient number of beds of the same purpose in other public hospitals.

# Legal  Affairs

## I . Revision Of Defense Regulation

There are 168 types of defense regulations. In order to facilitate the execution of defense work and to protect the legal rights of the people, the MND has revised each year a number of the regulations or formulated new ones. In 1994 and 1995, five regulations were formulated, including "Service Regulation of Officers and NCOs of the Army, Navy, and Air Forces" and revised the "Regulation of Rewards for the Army, Navy, and Air Force", plus 31 others. Ten regulations abrogated, including the " Controll oof the were Telecommunications in the period of mobilization". Table 5-6 shows 46 different kinds going through the act of formulation, revision, and abrogation. The "Regulation of the Renewal of the Obsolescent Dependent Houses" had been passed by the Legislative Yuan on January 22, 1996.

## Ii. Education Of Military Laws

The purpose of teaching military laws is to ensure that officers and men understand and abide by the laws, to improve their sense of morality, to cement the discipline, and to increase the combat power, "training outlines on military education" had been published by the MND. The service headquarters are, in turn, required to plan their own annual teaching of the military laws. As a Chinese saying goes, "To punish a person who violates the laws without having told him first is to maltreat him". Therefore, in the first week of recruit training, no less than six hours of teaching on military laws should be given. Those officers and men, or military employees on active duty, should receive education of no less than 12 hours on military laws per year.

Apart from the mobile lectures given by judge advocates in various establishments, other augmentations, such as television shows, questioning with prizes, speech making contests, prize essays, poster contests, and puzzles, can be used to have fun with the teaching and learning of military laws. The whole program is designed for crimeprevention.

## Ii. Legal Assistance

To protect the legal rights of military personnel and their families, assistance is offered to them. Appendix 4 and 5 are "publication of assistance on lawsuits for military personnel and their families" and "legal service to the armed forces". Thirty-one attorneys at law are paid by the military to assist the servicemen free of charge when they are involved in lawsuits. The military lawyers are also to act as legal advisers and to answer questions as may be asked by the military 238 personnel on duty. In 1994 and 1995, there were 872 lawsuit cases in which military personnel were involved. 80% of cases turned out to be winning for the military persons. The other legal assistants amounted to 6,305 cases. All the active service personnel, and employees in the military complements, cadets, military spouses, direct-related relatives, survivors of dead veterans and even their adopted members of families are entitled to get the above-mentioned legal assistance.

# Coordination Between Governmental Agencies And Military Establishments

The main tasks of military defense are to build our defense forces and to maintain combat effectiveness; nevertheless, the basic purpose of any governmental agency is to look after the welfare of its people. For that purpose, MND is coordinating closely with other governmental agencies in supporting basic governmental policies.

## I . Relations Between Yuans And Ministries 1. Liaison With The Executive Yuan

Proposition of Administrative Plans b.

According to Article 26 of "Budget Law", before the budget is appropriated, all the authorities concerned in the government should provide the Executive Yuan with the reference data regarding the administrative plans for the following fiscal year. The Executive Yuan, having considered the necessity of national build-up, made an bottom-up review of the resources available, initiated its administrative plans made by a priority process. Then the Executive Yuan will submit this to the President for announcement before late October. Based upon the requirement for national security and the demands of the current situation, MND will submit its administrative plan to the Executive Yuan for approval.

Collective Reports of Important Administrative Plan MND, in accordance with the annual administrative plans, is dedicated to implementing essential plans and the middle ten days of each month, will present the Executive Yuan the vital missions achieved the previous month. In 1994 and 1995, 356 vital missions were successfully completed. Meanwhile, with the information collected by the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan regarding essential missions achieved by various Ministries and Commissions, MND is able to understand the missions carried by the other Ministries and Commissions and can contact and coordinate with them.

The Collective Reports on Public Security c.

d.

In order to control public security, enforce the measures for public security and maintain social stability and prosperity, the Executive Yuan, invites the appropriate

ministers concerned for their reports on public security, during which issues relating to MND, such as the "Coast Guard Command's responsibilities for joint arresting of smugglers" and "maritime hotels accommodating and hiring Mainland China fishermen", have been conducted in accordance with the resolutions made in the collective · meetings.

## 2. Liaison With The Examination Yuan

In July 1993, the Legislative Yuan cancelled the addition of credits in favor of military personnel who may take the national examination for civil servants. MND tried to protect the legitimate privileges of the military personnel by submitting to the Ministry of Examination an in-depth study of the regulations which were recognized, amended and then enacted by the Examination Yuan. Now active military men can participate in the national advanced and general examinations. After passing the tests, they can take the training ( for the compulsory service, they can take the training after they retire from the services) . After leaving military service, they can apply for jobs. If the reserves are rewarded with medals of National-Glory, Blue Sky and White Sun , Precious-Tripod, Loyalty and Bravery, Yun Hui and Tai-Tong, or if they are wounded on duty, they can receive extra credits when they take the national examinations.

# Encourage Civilian Sectors To Take Part In The Defense Affairs

## I . Studies On Major Defense Affairs By Civilian Sectors

In order to have competent and thorough studies regarding important and complicated defense affairs, many civilian and academic institutes have been invited to conduct specific research. Since 1995, ten studies have been made.

Their findings and recommendations have been included in the annual programs of many defense units. Professor Ding Kun-jian of the National Chiao-tung University, for instance, was entrusted to study on the feasibility of adopting a system, similar to the American ROTC fhe armed forces. Resulting from Professor Dings studies which show the high feasibility for ROTC, the system has been approved for pilot studies in 1996. There were a total of 14 special studies undertaken by National Central University, National Chengchi University, National Chung Hsing University and Aerospace Study Group of the Ministry of Economics.

# Peoples Right

## I . Appeals From The People And National Compensations 1. Appeals From The People

In accordance with Article 27 of the Law of Appeal, a
" Petition Deliberative Committee " was established, responsible for dealing with appeals which might be made by people due to administration negligence or inappropriate administrative penalties. Any person who may think that they have been maltreated, or their rights have been unlawfully violated by the military, may make appeals in compliance with the legal procedures accompanied with the necessary documents. In recent years, a greater portion oe appeals are concerned with the retirement pay, mistakes in calculating the length of service and salaries, and requests for getting rewards for the " Warriors · Farming Field Certificates". In 1994 and 1995 there were 196 appeal cases, of which 137 cases were rejected, 22 cases were told to have the original verdicts reconsidered or changed , and 32 cases were either transferred, cancelled or closed. 5 cases remained undecided. Table 6-4 shows the results made by the Petition Deliberative Committee.

## 2. National Compensations

According to Article 17 of Regulations on the execution of National Compensation Law, if any civil servant in his performance of duties, due to negligence or deliberation, violates the freedom or legal right of the people, or causes death or damage to people's property, the agency of that civil servant can be approached for compensation. The sufferer has to submit in writing his/her name, age, residence, facts and reasons for his appeal for national compensation. The MND and GHQs (including Armed Forces Reserve Command and Ministry of Police Command
) have jointly established the compensation and Arbitration Council to manage national compensation events. In 1994 and 1995, the MND has received 55 appeal causes for compensations, of which 36 were concluded and 19 are pending.

## Ii . Solving The Land Disputes Between The Military And Civilians

MND is now making the overall review on land use by the military. A computerized file system on military land is being set out with maps and indexes, designed to eventually solve land disputes. In the early period of the government's evacuation from Mainland China, the land needed by the government were obtained by some simple procedure, or even just by oral consultation without having to go through legal procedures. Some landowners have the traditional habits of being reluctant to sell the lands which might be needed by the military. They only wanted to lend rather than sell. In time, it appears that the military are occupying -
the land.

## 1. The Uses Of Public Land

In March 1994, to cooperate with Ministry of Finance which has published "Project Of Clarifying The National And Public Owned Lands Occupied By Others", the Army, Navy and Air Force GHQs were ordered to make an overall review of the land. Land having no further planned military use are to be returned to local authorities for local construction project. Land which still are to be used and are not in conflict with the city planning, should take appropriate legal process to continue its use. In 1994 and 1995, after the review, there were 468 parcels of land
(about 22 hectares ) returned to Cheng-kung Camp of Chang-hwa County and the ammunition depot of Taipei County; another 1, 430 parcels of the land (about 175 hectares) will soon be returned; 860 parcels of land (about 191 hectares) have gone through the legal process of using belonging to Dah-Fu Camp of Ilan County, Yang-ming Camp of Taipei City, Peng-Yuan Camp of Pingtung County. The successful rate of land dispute resolution amounts to 12%. Another 2,352 parcels of lands (about 1, 072 hectares) are undergoing the process of being returned.

Due to some complications, 1,764 parcels of lands (about 750 hectares ) in Tien-lung Camp of Taichung County are pending due to other related laws for returned.

## 2. The Uses Of Private People'S Land

Private land, no matter if they are rented , borrowed, or occupied, will be returned. If the land can not be returned, agreements to purchase from the owners have to be accomplished by negotiating with the owners. If the owners do not want to sell the land, then depending on the value of the land, a decision will be made to legally lease, or to acquire the land. Legal documents are necessary for action to be taken. In 1995 and 1996 budget of NTD 2,930,000,000 has been allocated for purchasing the 89 locations of lands
(about 93 hectares) in Tuhian Camp in Hsinchu County, Tapojao Camp in Taoyuan County, Tunghsiao Camp in Miaoli County and the Pingtung airfield. In compliance with the source reduction plan, and the dispersal of depots and warehouses, the needed land must be numbered and coded according to the city planning, and to be filed and keyed in to the computers.

## Military Land Occupied By People 3. Ii . The Ease Of Military Control And The Restricted Areas

In recent years, the military has eased the control in important military zones, coastal areas, and in the mountains to support the national economic development plans and redesignation of national land. The original purpose of restrictions on the land was aimed at safeguarding the fighting capabilities and the security of the people.

Due to indistinct boundaries of some military land, or poor management, some military land is being occupied. During the past two years, 39 parcels of land (about 7.4 hectares)
have been taken back by the military in Pingser Camp of Tainan County, Cheng-kung Command Post in Hualien County, Taipei Gougfu Association, Pa-de Camp in Taoyuan County, and Dong-shun Training Ground in Kaoshiung County. There is other land (about 7.4 hectares)
remaining to be settled. To date, the rate of success in land resolution is 1.2%.

a.

Forts On 31 December 1995, public notification was made to cancel the restrictions on land in Lii-yu-shan of Taitung City and Jy-been Bridge-head of Taitung County and Liupooshan of Hsinchu County. The land now under reduced control totals 222.4 hectares. A decision will be made on the consideration of legitimate operational requirements and the prevention of military industrial complexs abuses.

b.

Control Zone of the Important Military Facilities On 30 May 1994, a joint public announcement was made by Ministry of Defense and Ministry of the Interior on
"The Scope Of Restriction In The Coasts, Mountains and Important Zones, And The Rules For The Implementation". By December 1995, 13 areas were still in control including "Ba-lii Village of Taipei County, Da-yuan Village of Taoyuan County, Chingshui of Taichung County, Tsoying of Kaoshiung County. 24 areas have been released from military control, including Tu-cheng of Taipei County, Chen-
Ping of Tang City and Chingshui of Taichung County, Shiow-shui of Changhua County, Ren-De of Tainan County and Hou-kao-tan of Penghu County. 22 areas have lesser control including Chan-chu-shan of Taipei County, Hsindian City, Chung-he City, Lin-kou Village, Hsichih Town, Dong-shan Village of Tainan County, Lung-tan of Taoyuan County. The amount of land released by the military totals 3072.1 hectares.

## 2. Coastal Controlled Areas

In accordance with Article 5 of the "National Security Act",
coastal controlled areas are the subdivided into
"continuously controlled areas" and "designated controlled areas". The former means 24 hour control while the latter means no control in daytime, only control in the night. The

24 hour control areas are in 21 places including Bi-tou-head, Fu-gui-head, Lin-yuan, Ryukyu, Wu-shi-bi and Kueishan Island which are 30 kilometers in length. The specifically controlled areas are situated in 31 placesluding Ye-liu, Hsinchu, Taishi, Lin-yuan, Dong-gang, Sha-mao-shan and Magong, 540 kilometers in length.

## 3. Mountain Controlled Areas

There were 29 remote mountains villages which belong to the " continuously controlled areas " and the police administration regularly exercise the checking and controlling. Nevertheless, since 1987 and up to date, 65 sightseeing places have been released from control over the tourists.

## Iv . Ban-Lifting On Communication Frequency

The frequencies used by the armed forces are based on
" International Telecommunication Treaty and Wireless Radio Regulations " and " Frequency Administration Regulations". Ministry of Defense has jointly published with the Ministry of Communications "Military Regulations on the Distribution of Frequency and Anti-jamming" to be used by combat and training units. Recently to comply with the governmental policies to remove bans on some radio frequencies, frequencies used by television, radio broadcasting and the Asian Transportation Center have been released. Many frequencies have been released for commercial uses provided that it does not conflict with the military combat readiness.

## V . Supporting Civil Air Transportation

To satisfy the public demand for increased air transportation services, the military within limits and noninterference with performance of military operations has opened up nine air bases in Hsichin, Chiai, Shuinan, Tainan, Pingtung, Hualien, Fenlien, Magong and Kingmen for the civil aircraft use. About 160 hectares of the land are planned for civil aviation. By 1995 there were 405 flights every day compared to 305 flights in 1994. The increased number of the flights was 33%. The military has alssisted the administration of civil aviation in increasing the ground control systems, terminal controlling spaces, lowering the standards of weather regulations and increasing the flying safety standards. New flights from Taiwan to Matsu and Magong to Hongkong have been established. Studies are being carried out in the feasibility of opening up Hsinchu and Hengchun air bases.

## Vi . High Attention Is Paid To The Work Of Environmental Protection 1. Refining The Plans

The armed forces have paid much attention to environmental protection which is of high priority. The work based on "The Outline Of Planning In Carrying Out Environmental Protection", is classified near and long term phases to annually deal with the pollution. The waste

materials generated by industry, such as solid waste, contaminated water and gases, noise will be addressed first, while the general wastes will be dealt routinely. The work will give a clean image to the armed forces.

## 2. Cultivating The Talented

One or two work meetings are to be held each year to guide and supervise the environmental protection work of the three military services. The meetings are also to find out the implementation of budget allocated for that purpose, as well as to detect any difficulties the working echelons might have been confronted. Since 1994 the funds needed for environmental protection were delegated to the five - year financial plans of the service headquarters. In 1995 and 1996, a budget of NTD464,930,000 was dedicated to the plan. College graduate students who have studies in civilian universities on environmental protection and have obtained master degrees could be selected to be reserve officers and assigned to the environmental duties during their service in the military.

## 3. Disposal Of The Waste

a.

## Dead Ammunition

(1)
 All ammunition must go through tests and technical verification every year. The aim is for the safety at the depots. Any old ammunition found to be bad, or beyond economic repair will have to be disposed.

The disposal of bad ammunition in many countries
(2)

is done by burning, exploding, disassembling, or chemical decomposing. But burning and exploding would cause noise and air pollution which is unsuitable for the environmental protection.

(3)
Better facilities for bad ammunition disposal are being planned in order to lift the quality of processing and to meet the standards.

of environmental protection desired by the government.

## B.

Disposal of Common Wastes
(1) Old or useless equipment, components and parts can be transferred, lent, cannibalized, disassembled, sold, given away or burned to fully use the surplus values.

(2) 
To sell the surplus, open biddings are needed. The money received will go to the national treasury.

Disposal of Medical Wastes (Water)
(1)
19 wasted water processing plants were set up in accordance with "Regulations On The Disposal Of Waste Materials And Waters From The Military Medical Units". The processing plants are subject checks by environmental agencies which have published the criterin for 1998. A budget of NTD
40,000, 000 was allocated to build the water processing plants in 1995 and 1996 for field hospitals titled 804, 815, 820, 814. The plants will be completed by June 1996. All the military hospitals must assign persons to be responsible for the processing of waste waters and the safety in the operation and monitoring of the
(2)
c.

quality of sampled water. The graphic development and image-fixed liquids are to be taken back by the suppliers. Radioactive isotopes are stored for decaying and exposed material rendered obsolete by ironized exchanges. Highly contaminated waste water is to be discharged after processing with the general wasted waters.

## 4. Prevention Of Pollution By The Military Factories

a.

Most military factories are working on care and maintenance, and therefore they belong to a rather low degree of pollution. The pollution-prevention measures are, however, in need of attention. The Army and Air Force have entrusted the Institute of Industrial Reserves and Chun-shing Consulting Company to undertake the plans of pollution prevention while the CSL and Chun-sun Institute have done their own plans and set out the protection facilities gradually. The naval yards and factories are working with some pollution consulting companies in the matters.

In 1995 and 1996, an investment of NTD 72,230,000 for b.

the pollution prevention work for the army aviation, and the 202, 203, 205 processing plants of the CSF, and also the 205 sewage processing plants.

## 5. Pollution-Prevention In Camps

a.

Processing of polluted waters: Kitchens and basing rooms will use gas in newly built barracks. The polluted waters are to be discharged into Lan-wu sewage system.

Oil and water separating devices are used before the polluted waters run out. This method meets the criteria for environmental protection.

.

Disposal of Garbage
(1)
The Industrial harmful waste will be separated and controlled. They are to be processed by private companies. Tracing and recording will be taken to ensure safety and to comply with "Plans on Reducing Wasted Materials".

Common waste materials are to be classified,
(2)
reduced, recycled and disposed. The military units are asked to reduce 5% of the waste each year , and recyclable materials should be increased by 10%
per year. The recycling plan was studied from July 1994. It was hoped to have more recyclable materials in each year.

## 1996 National Defense Report 272 Prevention Of Noise Pollution 6. Prevention Of Air Pollution 7.

Under the condition that flight missions and safety are not affected, during all landing and taking off military aircraft flying angles and directions should be conducted with minimal noise pollution. Supersonic flying over cities and land service is strictly prohibited in order to reduce the noise level. Additionally, in keeping with monitoring network for noise in Pingtung, Chiai, Magong, Kingmen, Taoyuan and Taitung , the devices for measuring noise levels are installed in cooperation with the civil aviation administration.

the Noise and Vibration Control exercised at a.

.

conventional artillery firing ranges (infantry firing, ship to shore bombardment, air to ground firing) and -
military enterprises should implement a good neighbor policy .

b.

Any complaints from the people nearby should be made in a trand and candid manner in order to secure the support from the people.

Since 1994, all the exhaust gas from civilian-made vehicles used by the military have met the standards set up by EPA. The engines of the 2.5 ton heavy trucks
(M35A2) in the infantry of the armed forces have been changed into the new types of engines. The emission of black smoke from the 1, 350 trucks have been effectively improved.

a.

Sea-dragon fire extinguishing system has been used.

The chemical compound of Fluorine (F2), Chlorine b.

(CI), and Carbon (C ) must be controlled. Data of the amount being used, stored, further needed, and recycled needs to be collected. Attention to the alternative systems, degrees of purity, methods for verification, recycled storage, and technical repeated use must be paid to reduce its destruction of the Ozone
(03) layer.

## 8. Military Construction

Control of ground construction must be exercised. The tires and bodies of the trucks must be washed before leaving the construction sites. Roads nearby the sites must be washed.

Water must be spread to prevent dust. Noise control is maintained. By not working during the resting hours of nearby inhabitants.

## 9. Assisting Local Environmental Protection

The EPA will sponsor a movement known as "National Clean-up Week". The military will support the movement by cleaning up the local surroundings. In 1994 and 1995, 35,000-man hours and 1,300 vehicles were dispatched to help 453 villages.

# Fraternal Services To The People

## I . Disaster Relief: Search And Rescue

Disasters in Taiwan, either natural or man-made, are caused by typhoons, torrential rains, earthquakes, air crashes, and shipping distress which brings damage and casualties. Because there is no "national relief agency", the armed forces have developed various emergency and assistant programs, and have conducted disaster simulation exercises. At the time of the disasters, all concerned units will participate in disaster- relief work, as well as in the recovery work of past disasters. For the time being, The Rescue Coordination Center of the armed forces is also responsible for the relief of air and shipping accidents within Taipei Flight Information Region; meanwhile it maintains contact with the Rescue Coordination Center of nearby countries to perform international rescue issues. Table 6-5 shows the statistic chart of disaster relief efforts by the armed forces in 1994 and 1995.
