_“We must not forget the past, but we can overcome it._

###### FOREWORD

The National Security Policy seeks to build the conditions for people to feel
safe, free from violence and fear, and confident in achieving their individual and
collective aspirations. It is also designed to integrate efforts across the country
in a common purpose: to achieve comprehensive development, strengthen
democracy, and overcome social inequality - to build a “Secure and Prosperous
_Guatemala.”_

The success of this policy demands that the Government and its citizens work
together to contain, confront, and neutralize the threats and risks that insecurity
and violence generate, overcoming the structural and social causes that they
engender, through the legal and institutional framework and with full respect
for human rights.

It is essential for the people to regain confidence in the State and to improve
coordination between its institutions to generate the required capabilities and
to diminish the causes that bring about insecurity and violence, which reside in
the social fabric. Only a democratic government has the legitimacy to do this,
in concert with an efficient security system that produces the necessary competencies to confront this challenge.

This policy establishes the Government’s commitment with the people of Guatemala, of making the National Security System comply with its institutional
mandate under its transformational motto: “If we all do well what we have to do,
we will improve security.” This means that Guatemala will transform its security system to the highest levels of effective and efficient public administration,
based on consistent decisions and actions.

The implementation of the policy will be developed in three successive phases.
In the first phase, new methodologies will be adapted to achieve efficiency in
the new model of administration. This effort will be concentrated in coordinating national institutions to take maximum advantage of existing capabilities.
The most modern management techniques will be incorporated to maximize
transparency mechanisms in public accounts for the restructuring of decisionmaking processes and allocation of resources, with the goal of optimizing institutional management.


-----

Throughout this first period, projects for the second phase will be planned and
executed, in which significant investment in modernization, technology, and
professionalization will be made in the Security System, risk management and
civil defense, and national defense. The goal is effectiveness in the most complex preventive and reactive tasks, which permit the execution of far-reaching
operational strategies, with a lower simultaneous response time in critical areas
of the national territory.

The third phase will be focused on the transformation of the institutional culture
of Security System organizations, with the goal of ensuring the effectiveness of
the change process through collaboration, cooperation, and coordination to
exercise command and control; taking advantage of communications and information technology, as well as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, in
order to harmonize the National Security Policy, National Strategic Security
Agenda, and the National Strategic Security Plan.

This focus should produce successive results achieving qualitative and quantitative increments in which security indicators reflect improvements in the
quality of life, associated with the development of productive capabilities and
ensuring the self-sustainability of the transformation process. In order to make
this possible, the Government must work comprehensively to guarantee two
basic requirements:

The first is the development and strengthening of government institutions responsible for the analysis, decision-making, implementation, supervision, and
evaluation that foster governance and maintain the processes of change toward
security objectives.

The second is maintaining a regional security environment that offers international cooperation conditions with internal change efforts from Guatemala.
The preceding will be based on the construction of mutual confidence measures
which have regional security cooperation agreements as a platform, particularly
in the development of Central American Security Strategy objectives.

The previous factors are determined by resistance to changes, particularly within
the government itself. The effort to overcome this resistance will demand the
exercise of strategic leadership, centralized in the Presidency to ensure the alignment of political priorities with the goals and plans of all government sectors.
Likewise, program actions that must be carried out by the Government’s ministries and institutions in their areas of responsibility will be guided by measurable
results and impacts.

There are eight transformational axes that cover the socio-human, politicaleconomic, environment, energy, geostrategic, technology, food, and intelligence
aspects, which define the change process objective – a secure and prosperous


The transformational axes will focus attention on the security problem that the
country faces, by means of five strategic guidelines:

1. Institutionalization of the National Security System, whose fundamental
objective is to develop and strengthen the institutions themselves. The
purpose is to transform and generate better public services, provide coverage
over the entire national territory, increase the presence of authority, and
recover control of critical areas with actions that ensure the distribution of
resources and linkage with the purposes outlined in the socio-human and
political-economic transformational axes.

2 Democratic national security is meant to ensure the protection of life, and
the full exercise of liberty, justice, security, peace, property, and self-development. This will develop relevant actions in the fields of social and situational
prevention, with emphasis on the formulation and implementation of programs in priority areas, such as secure spaces in the home, neighborhoods,
cities, and borders; secure mobility to develop employment and personal
activities in the streets, highways, public transportation; group agreements
with young people, women, indigenous people, and labor unions; countering
the trafficking of drugs, persons, arms, munitions, explosives, and contraband,
among others. Also the control of violence and crime, as well as comprehensive care of victims, and institution building, so that people can improve
their living conditions.

3 The objective of external security is to maintain sovereignty and territorial
integrity and to contribute to the maintenance and strengthening of international peace and security, while creating an environment that enables the
achievement of national interests.

4 The objective of proactive risk management and civil defense is to regulate
the use of critical national resources and to create effective mechanisms to
prevent, mitigate, and respond to the country’s vulnerabilities that are due
to natural disasters and human-caused damages. Therefore, it is necessary
to encourage land management that will guide socio-economic processes
and the orderly occupation of space according to the potential land use and
resources from different regions of the country.

5 State Strategic Intelligence gives the State a national intelligence system that,
besides providing current and structural analysis, can anticipate, prevent,
contain, and deal with different risks, threats, and vulnerabilities that may
affect the quality of life and that provide the essential elements for executive
decision-making.

During the entire process, the Government’s strategic communications will
present the latest developments of indicators to all national segments with
transparency and precision. These results will demonstrate how security adds
value and competition to goods and services, while presenting these achieve-i


-----

Humanitarian assistance and international cooperation have contributed to decreasing the basic needs of the population, without overcoming existing structural scourges, which limit Guatemala’s overall development. It is vital to rely
on all resources to carry out the intended strategic guidelines. Therefore, the
country should courageously face its weaknesses with its own resources.

The success of the National Security Policy will depend entirely on us, on our
will, and firm willingness to transform the Security System to achieve a Safe
_and Prosperous Guatemala._

risks and threats against the vulnerabilities of society and its institutions. It includes those challenges outlined in the Threats and Risks Agenda collected from
the inputs of various workshops with individual experts and representatives from
civil society organizations that are concerned with security. It comprehensively
addresses national security as one of the priority tasks of the current government.

The first actions are borne out in various National Agreements and Government
Plans; efforts that have generated a favorable perception concerning the intervention of public forces to fight common and organized crime. However, insecurity
continues to affect various parts of the country; therefore, it is fundamental to
approach the criminal phenomenon in a comprehensive manner as one of the
current government’s priority tasks.

Among the threats that directly and negatively affect the patrimony of Guatemalans include extortion, kidnapping, and the theft of vehicles, homes, businesses,
and cell phones. Those that affect life are femicide, assassination, murder, kidnapping, narcotrafficking, and terrorism. Those that undermine democratic institutionality include illicit drug activity, trafficking of persons, arms, munitions,
explosives, and contraband. Additionally, risks and vulnerabilities appear, such
as governability, social unrest, institutional fragility, porous borders, as well as
natural, social, and technological disasters, and pandemics, epidemics, and
endemic diseases.

The National Security Policy is the answer from the National Security Council
to satisfy the demand from Guatemalan citizens, to live in liberty, peace, justice,
security, and development, by promoting a climate of national and international
investment and contributing to sustainable development.

This brings about the achievement of international standards[1] and norms concerning the prevention and control of crime, justice, and other appropriate instruments
from the formulation and evaluation process established in the National Security
System’s Framework Law. Considering the complex, multi-factorial, and multidimensional character of the criminal phenomenon, the National Security Policy
constitutes the framework for the coordination of effort between the central and
municipal government institutions, because that is where the various institutional
efforts should materialize, through the participation of Government Departments,
City Councils, Urban and Rural Development Councils, the private sector, centers
of higher learning, and social communications media.

The National Security Policy fulfills mutually complementary institutional
functions. Their development defines the structure and interrelation of its component elements.

The first institutional function provides the security conditions that people
want by identifying the risks, threats, vulnerabilities, and challenges to confront
along with the Government’s integrated actions, in order to achieve the strategic
objectives within the minimum timeframe and at the lowest cost. This function
will be addressed by identifying the security objectives needed to develop the
respective program actions required in order to generate measurable effects in
the transformational axes, which conform to the guiding principles of Government actions, within the legal framework, to achieve the purposes presented in
the strategic narrative written by the President.

The second institutional function establishes the trajectory and reach of joint
Government actions and identifies desired effects and established limits, so
that each institution can recognize the assigned tasks required to accomplish
its mission, with the clear vision that accomplishing these tasks effectively and
efficiently contributes to the general purpose of the National Security System.

The National Security Policy directs the formulation and compliments itself
through the National Security Strategic Agenda and the National Security Strategic
Plan, in accordance with the Framework Law for the National Security System.

The third institutional function builds the bases for the harmonious functioning
of all the components of the National Security System, through the State’s legal,
administrative, and budgetary framework, in order to ensure the effectiveness
of the formulation and planning processes and sector management strategies,
with respect to their responsibilities in simultaneously contributing to the
achievement of security and sustainable national development.

The National Security Policy establishes throughout its text the rules for resultsoriented, comprehensive security management, by assigning the foundations
for the continuous evaluation of efficiency, efficacy, and effectiveness of program
actions. It consists of six chapters. Each of them describes the subject and the
necessary actions to develop the guidelines to resolve the issues considered.

It begins with the definition of the Guiding Principles of a general nature for
the institutions that make up the National Security System; a Legal Framework
that begins with respect for the Guatemalan Constitution, the specific laws of
each institution, agreements and decrees relative to their functioning, as well as
rules and international agreements in the security arena.

In the conceptualization and methodology, the former states the concepts utilized and defined in the Framework Law for the National Security System, while
the latter explains the methodological framework employed to produce the
policy, while taking into consideration the proposals developed beforehand in
discussions and participation in methodological workshops and seminars.


The Strategic Characterization describes the international environment and
the national context in which it highlights the regional security concept changes,
integration of blocs, the political instability of the region, and transnational
organized crime, as well as the prevailing crime rate in the country, all of which
can identify the threats, risks, vulnerabilities, and challenges.

The above provides the elements that define the Transformational Axes, the
Strategic Guidelines, and the Program Objectives that will lead to its development.

The efficient Management of Change and Evaluation Processes include the
systemization and monitoring of security indicators, results-based management,
and the supervision and evaluation of short, medium, and long term actions. Finally, they expand specific information regarding regulatory reference elements.

As a whole, this policy is the proposal that the National Security Council offers
to the nation to confront security threats, risks, vulnerabilities, and challenges.

## CHAPTER I. GUIDING PRINCIPLES

Principles are the pillars that govern the National Security Policy. They are
derived directly from the Guatemalan Constitution, the Framework Law for
the National Security System, and current regulations and doctrine. They
serve as a guide for implementation and for that reason they are of a general
and national nature.

#### RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW

Guatemala is governed by a system of laws and institutions contained in the
Constitution, which organizes and sets limits on the government, besides guaranteeing the rights of individuals. This politico-juridical organization is the legal
framework where the obligations of the State rest and the power of the Rule of
Law, to which all its inhabitants are subject.[2] They are elements that define the
Rule of Law as the instrument that guides the behavior of rulers and those ruled
in a democracy. Transparency, predictability, and generality are implicit in it.
This allows human interactions, prevention, the effective, efficient, and peaceful
resolution of conflicts, and it supports sustainable development and social peace.

The law must be a principal management instrument of the Government; the
law guiding human behavior and state agencies must respect the constitutional
principle of separation of powers and they must consistently interpret and apply
it within the legal system, by accepting the supremacy of the Constitution and
the State’s responsibility to its citizens for its acts.

The State justifies the reason for its existence in the protection of the individual
and the family, through the recognition, respect, and protection of the rights and
freedoms inherent to human dignity and strengthening the functioning of governing bodies. In this sense, the Attorney General’s Office has special relevance, in
its advisory and counseling role to State agencies and entities, through the Attorney General, as the representative of the State and the Head of the Attorney
General’s Office.[3]

#### OBSERVANCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS

Human rights constitute the reason that the Rule of Law exists, that they are
observed and distinguished as interdependent, indivisible rights and are inherent
to all human beings, regardless of nationality, place of residence, sex, national or
ethnic origin, color, religion, language, or any other condition.

The State of Guatemala recognizes the International Law on Human Rights,
which determines the obligations of governments to take action in certain situations, or refrain from acting in certain ways in others, in order to promote and
protect human rights and the fundamental freedoms of individuals or groups.[4]

The National Security Policy is based on the above statements, which serve as a
framework for the full respect for human rights in the constitutional principles
that underpin and promote these rights and in the current legal-political order.

This implies that the rights and freedoms recognized by the Constitution of the
Republic of Guatemala must be respected in the achievement of national security
strategic objectives and guidelines, as well as the democratic form of government
and international treaties and agreements regarding human rights that have
been accepted and ratified by Guatemala.

#### GENDER INCLUSION

Within the framework of national security the State is committed to promoting
gender equality and inclusiveness in the country. In this regard, that principle is
established in the formulation, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of
the different sectors’ security policies, with emphasis on reducing the levels of
domestic violence and femicide, as a result of increasing violent actions against
women during the last few years.

#### RESPECT FOR CULTURAL DIVERSITY

Guatemala is a country known for its cultural diversity, which is manifested by
the presence of various ethnic groups, which are distinguished by their way of life,
traditions, customs, and beliefs. These characteristics are the reason for the focus
on security programs from a community level approach to a local one. Considering
all these aspects, the National Security Policy recognizes, respects, and assumes
responsibility for ensuring their development and coexistence according to their
particular worldview,[5] within the Rule of Law, as a single multi-ethnic, multicultural, and multilingual nation.

#### INSTITUTIONAL INTEGRATION

The Framework Law for the National Security System establishes four functional
domains: Internal Security, External Security, State Intelligence, and Risk
Management and Civil Defense. However, as a whole these distinct areas make
up the general framework of National Security and therefore, to avoid piecemeal
approaches that may hinder interagency coordination, the National Security
Policy develops a comprehensive strategic vision.

The National Security Policy contains the strategic objectives and guidelines
for each of the National Security System functional domains, seeking harmonization, coherence, and complementarity for the efficient use of available resources
and to avoid the predominance of partial and insufficient strategic visions, as
well as duplication of effort.

The Technical Secretariat for the National Security Council, as the focal point
for the coordination of National Security Council institutions, will ensure that
the strategic vision is integrated into the National Security Policy.

#### COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT

The National Security Policy requires the involvement and commitment of all
citizens and stakeholders to carry out programs, plans, and activities. The solution for existing problems in these areas is not possible with only the effort from
responsible state institutions; it demands citizen involvement, particularly in
the domains of internal security and risk management and civil defense. The
objectives and specific criteria for this citizen involvement will be defined by
the responsible institutions, according to their respective area of performance
in corresponding sectoral policies.

#### TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

Public confidence in National Security System institutions is strengthened
through the promotion of transparency and accountability, which also have
significant effects on the levels of effectiveness and efficiency of actions for
the benefit of citizens.

Each institution in the National Security System will guarantee and implement access to information, through their respective units of access to public
information and in compliance with applicable law, for the purpose of transparency and accountability in the execution of their policies, plans, and programs,
among others.


-----

#### RESULTS-BASED MANAGEMENT

This is based on strategic planning, which considers the priorities of security
and justice institutions. This is done by identifying and prioritizing objectives
and actions as a methodological support activity in achieving performance
indicators, which are focused on meeting the strategic guidelines defined in the
National Security Policy at a given time.

Institutional effectiveness is focused on the formal and continuous evaluation
of processes and support services, compliance with institutional objectives, and
the management of results obtained for continuous improvement. This will only
be achieved to the extent that officials take responsibility for the results of their
administration, and when institutions fulfill the purposes for which they were
created and meet the objectives established in this Policy for the benefit of the
population.

The above will provide for the management and evaluation of the actions of
state organizations to meet the demands of society.


## CHAPTER II. LEGAL FRAMEWORK

#### CONSTITUTIONAL

The State of Guatemala was founded as a legal and political entity, governed
by the Constitution of the Republic of Guatemala. Its structure consists of the
following elements: sovereignty, territory, government, citizenry, and the legal
system. This legal system determines the use of power for the maintenance of
State security and the defense of its territory. The President of the Republic of
Guatemala has the constitutional mandate to provide for the defense and security of the nation, as well as the preservation of public order,[6] which in certain
circumstances requires the restriction of the guarantees that the Constitution
provides. In this case, it must assure the inhabitants of the country that only
those legal measures that are strictly necessary will be applied.[7]

The Constitution of the Republic of Guatemala establishes the maintenance of
independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Guatemala as national
interests, as well as the peace and external security of the country through the
preservation and strengthening of international relations. These represent the
country’s vital interests, the achievement of which guarantees the freedom,
well-being, and security of its citizens and the Guatemalan State itself. Likewise, the State of Guatemala is organized to protect the individual and the family,
with the duty to provide the inhabitants of the Republic, life, liberty, justice,
security, peace, and comprehensive personal development.[8]

The threats, risks and vulnerabilities facing national security may or may not
vary over time, depending on the trends and development experienced specifically in the strategic environment. In contrast, national interests in security
matters are stable and durable; they tend to remain over time.

maintain the inhabitants of the nation in the full enjoyment of the rights guaranteed by the Constitution. However, in case
of invasion, serious disturbance of the peace, activities against the security of the State, or public calamity, it shall be able
to terminate the full exercise of said rights, which are referred to in Articles 5, 6, 9, 26, 33, and the first paragraph of Article
35, second paragraph of Article 38, and second paragraph of Article 116.”


-----

#### INSTITUTIONAL

Within the institutional framework, the Policy corresponds to the principles
and rules contained in the Framework Treaty on Democratic Security in Central
America, the fulfillment of the Peace Accords, and international instruments
ratified by Guatemala.

The Framework Agreement is based on the supremacy of civilian authority,
a reasonable balance of forces, the security of individuals and their property,
overcoming poverty and extreme poverty, promoting sustainable development,
protecting the environment and patrimony, and eradicating violence, corruption, impunity, terrorism, and drug and arms trafficking.

Democratic security is based on democracy, the strengthening of its institutions, and the Rule of Law; in the existence of governments elected by universal,
free and secret ballot; and in the unconditional respect of all human rights in
those States that comprise the Central American region. Its reason for being is
the respect, promotion, and protection of all human rights, so that its provisions
will ensure the safety of the Central American States and its people, by creating
the conditions that will allow for their personal, familial, and social development in peace, freedom, and democracy.

The implementation of the National Security System is given by Decree 18-2008,
Framework Law for the National Security System, by the Congress of the Republic of Guatemala. The system consists of: a) the Presidency of the Republic,
b) the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, c) the Ministry of the Interior; d) the Ministry
of National Defense, e) the Attorney General’s Office, f) the National Coordinator for Disaster Reduction; g) the Secretariat of State for Strategic Intelligence
and h) the Secretariat of Administrative Affairs and Security for the Presidency
of the Republic.[9]

The purpose of the National Security System is the strengthening of State institutions, risk prevention, control of threats, and reduction of vulnerabilities
that prevent the State from achieving its goals. These activities are intended to
contribute to the security and defense of the nation, the protection of human
beings and the common good, and to establish the responsibilities of the component entities of the National Security System, as well as regulating interagency
relationships, based their areas of competence.[10]


The functional domains of the National Security System are:
1. Internal Security proactively and directly confronts the set of risks and
threats originating from common and organized crime.
2. External Security deals with Guatemala’s independence and sovereignty,
territorial integrity, peace, and the preservation and strengthening of international relations.
3. Risk Management and Civil Defense develops and implements policies
for the prevention, preparation, mitigation, response, and recovery from
events of a natural, social, and technological order that could affect the population; and
4. State Intelligence, articulates the information and intelligence on internal and
external threats, risks, and vulnerabilities in the three areas mentioned above.[12]

The coordination for the National Security System is under the responsibility of
its political body; the National Security Council; which defines policies and strategies and advises the President of Guatemala in making decisions on security
matters. The Council is comprised of the following dignitaries and officials: a)
the President, who makes the decisions; b) the Vice President; c) the Minister of
Foreign Affairs; d) the Minister of the Interior; e) the Minister of National Defense;
f) the Secretary of State for Strategic Intelligence; and g) the Attorney General.

The principal functions of the National Security Council are: to coordinate and
supervise the operation of the institutions responsible for security; to define
and approve the National Strategic Agenda, the National Security Strategic
Plan, and the National Security Policy; to be aware of and advise on matters of
strategic importance for the country’s security; to define the specific policies
and strategies concerning external security, internal security, and intelligence;
to promote the updating of the regulatory and institutional framework applicable
to security activities; and to form a crisis committee during national emergencies; as well as other functions.

In order for the National Security Council to fulfill its functions effectively and
efficiently, the Framework Law for the National Security System provides support agencies: the Technical Secretariat for the National Security Council, the
Advisory and Planning Commission, the National Institute for Strategic Security Studies, and the General Inspectorate for the National Security System.

Besides creating various support agencies for the operation of the National
Security Council, the Framework Law also identified and determined the
development of several working tools or instruments for the Council: a) the Risk
and Threat Agenda, b) the National Security Policy, c) the Strategic Security
Agenda, and d) the Strategic Security Plan.


The objectives of the National Security System are: a) to bring coherence and Besides creating various support agencies for the operation of the National

These four tools are part of the process that the National Security Council

## CHAPTER III. CONCEPTUALIZATION AND  METHODOLOGY

#### CONCEPTUALIZATION

National Security is closely linked to the Democratic Security model. In this
regard, the final paragraph of the Framework Law for the National Security
System stipulates that: “... it is particularly important that the National Security
System be based on the principles and rules contained in the Framework Treaty
on Democratic Security in Central America, to make it feasible to fulfill the
commitments made in the Peace Accords, the Framework Law for the Peace
Accords, and the international instruments ratified by Guatemala.”

For this reason, in order to facilitate an understanding of the design process and
formulation of the National Security Policy, some definitions and concepts are
referenced, which in the estimation of the Technical Secretariat for the National
Security Council, are important to unify criteria related to National Security.

**National Security includes a set of principles, policies, objectives, strategies,**
procedures, agencies, functions, and responsibilities of the components of the
State in security matters, to ensure national independence, sovereignty, integrity,
and the fundamental rights of the populace that are established in the Constitution of the Republic of Guatemala, which consolidate peace, development,
justice, and respect for human rights.[13]

**Democratic Security is state action that guarantees the respect, promotion,**
and guardianship of security, while fully exercising human rights through the
creation of conditions that allow individuals their personal, familial, and social
development in peace, freedom, and democracy, in accordance with the provisions of the Framework Treaty on Democratic Security in Central America.[14]

**National Security Policy is the set of guidelines that define the courses of**
action designed to prevent and counter the risks and threats that may arise due
to the vulnerability of society and its institutions. It shall be approved by the
National Security Council. It is intended to guarantee those preventive or reactive
actions that the State should take to ensure the achievement of national interests
against any threat, aggression, or situation which by its very nature poses a risk

-----

**National Objectives are the interests and aspirations that the State of Gua-**
temala must satisfy and guarantee; the needs contained in the principles of the
Constitution of the Republic.

**Threats are intentional phenomena generated by the power of another State**
or by non-state actors, characterized by the integration of hostile and deliberate
capability and intent that seriously threatens to violate another country’s
national interests and objectives, in part or throughout the entire country, and
that questions the existence of that same State.

**Risks are obstacles to National Security that, even though they are not a threat,**
imply an internal or external condition generated by political, economic, or social
situations or non-state actors, as well as by natural or man-made disasters, or
pandemics, whose presence could endanger national development. These are
offset by the implementation of public policies to prevent them from becoming
a threat.

**Vulnerabilities are the exposure of harmful conditions facing the State’s**
security institutions, which jeopardize the effectiveness of security programs.
Among these are corruption, administrative and operational deficiencies,
involvement in illicit activities, little security presence throughout the national
territory, limited budgets, lack of job security, and low wages.

#### METHODOLOGY

The design and development of the National Security Policy begins with the
National Security Council’s requirement to develop the Risks and Threats Agenda
for the Secretariat of State for Strategic Intelligence, which affects National
Security. Based on this Agenda, the Technical Secretariat presents the draft of
the National Security Policy that was given out to the different academic, social,
business, political, religious and municipal sectors of Guatemalan society for
their input.

To this end, a methodological proposal and roadmap of the National Security
Policy development process was developed. It was based primarily on the criteria
and standards that have effectively guided the construction of similar instruments in other countries, as well as considering any existing best practices for
interagency formulation and discussion of national security issues.

Because of their importance, the following activities should be highlighted:

1. From the beginning, the process depended upon the approval of the National
Security Council and the political leadership’s commitment of support.

2 The “Technical Committee for National Security Policy” was formed and it
was supported by representatives from the System’s institutions for discussion and decision-making in relation to the implementation of the National
Security Policy draft and its respective roadmap.


3 Active participation of citizens in the formulation of the draft National
Security Policy was encouraged.

4 Inputs on security issues were collected from individual experts and representatives from civil society organizations.

5 Discussion seminars on methodological processes, problem analysis, and
goal setting were conducted.

6 Discussion workshops on National Security Policy were held at the sectoral
and national level.

7 The National Security Policy proposals developed in 2008 and 2010 were
considered.

The Technical Secretariat was tasked with coordinating ongoing interagency
efforts for the design, analysis, discussion, and integration of the inputs from
National Security institutions and the various participating sectors.

The National Security Policy depends on social and institutional support bases
to help make it a permanent instrument to benefit national security.

The correlation between the Transformational Axes and Strategic Guidelines
was established through an analytical model developed through the participation of representatives from government ministries and secretariats, advised
by experts and scholars. This allowed for the diagramming of the relationships
between the multiple and concurrent causes and consequences of insecurity.

This impacts diagram allowed them to clearly identify the major areas of government action necessary to confront Guatemala’s structure of insecurity. Each
of these areas corresponds to the strategic guidelines, each one focused on a
Security Objective.

This same methodology ensures logical consistency and mutual complementarity between the National Security Policy, the National Security Strategic
Agenda, and the National Security Strategic Plan through an array of results
indicators.

Its formulation was developed through critical reviews from a rough draft coordinated by the Technical Secretariat for the National Security Council. In this
five-month continuous work process, the participation of the members of the
National Security System increased the internal consistency of the document,
while the links of shared responsibility of all members were completed with the
desired result: Achieving a Safe and Prosperous Guatemala.

## CHAPTER IV. STRATEGIC CHARACTERIZATION

This is based primarily on Guatemala’s geographical position in relation to
drug producing countries and consuming countries, their access to both oceans
provides opportunities for development, but for that same reason it is vulnerable
to tropical storms, hurricanes, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions. It shares
proximity to Mexico, Belize, El Salvador, and Honduras.

For methodological purposes the security environment is addressed first,
which covers the global, continental, and regional levels and then following
with the internal context.

#### SECURITY ENVIRONMENT

This is related to the world order that left behind the bipolarity of international
politics with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, which considered the United
States as the hegemon. International relations and their respective security
agendas were reconfigured, occurring simultaneously with the globalization
process that allowed the weakening of State sovereignty and the strengthening
of criminal organizations on the one hand, while on the other hand generating
economic crises that influenced State security systems. In addition, due to the
draw-down of military forces, it created the conditions for the emergence of
ethno-religious conflicts in several world regions.

The terrorist attacks of September 2001 reshaped international relations policies
and security agendas, which prioritized terrorism as a threat to state security.
In this regard, the international security agenda is complemented by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime,[16] trafficking in small
arms, ammunition and explosives, human trafficking, and the existence of
internal conflicts by exploiting strategic resources, which in some regions of the
world demands the intervention of the international community.

The influence of multinational companies and major players operating in the
global financial markets are able to alter government policies, strengthen or
weaken territorial equilibriums, and intervene in areas that have not yet been
contemplated, while the prices of basic goods unbalance the economies of countries, particularly those with high levels of poverty.

It is assumed, then, that sources of risk and potential threats to which a response is required are many and varied. These range from conflicts between
States, to international terrorism in its various forms, cyber attacks, as well as
energy, economic, environmental, immigration, political, religious, and social
factors, among others.

At the continental level, State security must be approached in a multidimensional fashion, which is known as the hemispheric security concept.[17] A new
security concept[18] like this encompasses the military, diplomatic, international
cooperation, and economic resource aspects, as well as disaster management or
the consequences of globalization. Thus, the security of a country is not independent of other countries or regions. This is one of the major effects of globalization, which has increased the interdependence and mutual cooperation
between actors and countries.

Regionally, Central America is going through one of the most difficult times in
its recent history. Violence has increased, particularly against women, caused

and 28 October 2003.


by the actions of violent youth gangs, organized crime, and more specifically
drug trafficking activities. Also, institutionalized corruption and impunity
oblige governments to use resources destined for development to combat and
reduce their pernicious effects. According to the 2010 World Bank report, the
number of violent deaths related to drug trafficking totals around 16,666, among
men and women. Additionally, fighting drug trafficking and other collateral
criminal activities costs the region about 8% of GDP.

Adding to the violence in the region are unresolved border issues, disputes over
strategic resources in shared areas, especially water and hydrocarbons, and
alliances derived from exclusionary pacts or agreements that affect the integrationist spirit. These problems pose potential regional conflict scenarios that
could hinder the search for new models to combat drug trafficking and other
threats in the region.[19]

Efforts to neutralize organized crime in Mexico and Colombia increased the
levels of violence in the region, which led to the creation of the Central American
Security Strategy for the Central American Integration System. This includes
the core themes of fighting crime, crime prevention, reintegration and rehabilitation, institution building, and the creation of the Central American Regional
Security Initiative (CARSI).

#### SECURITY CONTEXT

The security context in Guatemala is directly related to its geographical location, the low presence of state institutions across the country, the porosity of its
land borders, the lack of ability to control its airspace and maritime areas, drug
trafficking, money laundering, terrorism, human trafficking, and the trafficking
of arms, ammunition, explosives, and contraband.

In relation to the border with Mexico, it is worth mentioning the displacement
of Mexican drug cartels into our territory with the purpose of controlling northern
logistics routes. This causes certain territorial areas to have a strong presence
from these organizations, which lobby for social control and encourage lawlessness in order to limit the presence of state authority.

Because of its geographical location, Guatemala is a transit country for drugs
produced in South America and bound for North America; it is also becoming a
poppy producer in recent years and receives precursor chemicals for the manufacture of synthetic drugs, endangering the life and health of citizens.

Organized and common criminal activities are increased by illicit drug operations. Drug trafficking is the criminal activity that causes the greatest impact


-----

on the daily lives of Guatemalans in their development and the governance of
the country. The crimes committed by drug traffickers are beyond our collective
imagination, as evidenced by the killing of authorities, beheadings, and mutilations, which demonstrate the weakness and inability of state institutions to
protect the population and territory.

Human trafficking has taken on increased importance because of the illicit
profits generated by such activity and its relation to human trafficking and other
related activities arising from the country’s geostrategic position.

Smuggling is an illegal activity that takes advantage of the vulnerabilities
caused by corruption and impunity, decreasing State revenues and limiting its
ability to provide better services to the population.

Terrorism is a threat to friendly nations, since it can take advantage of Guatemala’s geostrategic position for the transit, rest, and planning of terrorist actions against targets of interest.

Illegal armed groups engage in illicit activities such as kidnapping, operating
drug trafficking networks, extortions, and contract killings in order to control
and secure the strategic routes and territories that facilitate the movement of
drugs, weapons, and people. They also infiltrate State institutions and corrupt
local authorities who are responsible for security and justice, to ensure the
success of their illegal activities by obtaining inside information, which is
enabled by the environment of impunity.

Femicide is a social phenomenon that is shown to be increasing in Guatemalan
society in recent years in the form of violent deaths of women in various settings, mainly in domestic relations, human trafficking, and in the context of
gender and power relationships between men and women.

Common crime affects the individual’s personal and legal assets through continual assaults and robberies. Meanwhile, gang activity impacts the safety of
individuals and their property, through extortion, murder for hire, and murder
of drivers of public transport, which increase the perception of insecurity and
fear, and reduce the quality of life of Guatemalans.


The levels of violent acts against people generate a climate of distrust and
uncertainty in the population. There were 25,612 violent deaths from 2008 to
2011, according to statistics from the National Institute of Forensic Sciences in
Guatemala (INACIF), shown in the following table:

|VIOLENT DEATHS 2008 - 2011|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|YEAR|STATISTICAL DATA FROM INACIF Men Women Total|||DAILY AVERAGE|
|2008 2009 2010 2011 TOTAL|4,616 6,706 5,842 5,530 22,694|537 829 842 710 2,918|5,153 7,535 6,684 6,240 25,612|14.12 20.64 18.31 17.09|


One can readily see the risks and vulnerabilities that affect the State of
Guatemala in the above scenario. Some that stand out are:

**Social Unrest. The level of unequal and insufficient development, coupled**
with the legal uncertainty of land ownership, the limited availability of arable
land, and the degradation and exploitation of natural and strategic resources
generate constant unrest by means of the different approaches taken to focus
attention and solve the demands and needs of the population.

**Lack of Governance. This occurs when the Government’s lack of action to**
achieve National Objectives erodes the legitimacy of public authority within the
population, resulting in a loss of confidence and support for the political system.

**Institutional Weakness. Guatemala has characteristics of a weak State. The**
institutions in the National Security and Justice System are discredited by
traits of inefficiency, corruption, and impunity, which have reduced the confidence of the population and have encouraged criminal evolution. The absence of
the state in some regions of the country encourages an atmosphere of chaos that
allows criminal organizations to develop and exercise local power.

**Porous Borders. The existence of multiple illegal pedestrian and vehicular**
passage points along the borders, with no government presence, demonstrates
the porosity of the borders and encourages and facilitates the trafficking of
drugs, weapons, ammunition, and explosives, the flow of undocumented immigrants, and smuggling.

-----

**Natural, Social, and Technological Disasters. The country is highly vulnerable**
because of its geographical location, which is aggravated by the social and economic situation, low levels of development, and high levels of poverty, inequality,
and social exclusion. In this area, the country’s main problem is the lack of land
management, resulting in illegal land invasions and social unrest, which require
the intervention of security forces.

**Pandemics, Epidemics and Endemics. There are risks to life and the overall**
development of citizens who demand more attention from the State and society
concerning infectious and contagious diseases transmitted from animals to
humans or within the same species, which can put the population at risk.

**The Territorial Dispute with Belize. The final resolution to the dispute is**
in process. The imminent step forward is the Popular Referendum to be held in
both countries in October 2013.

The evolution of these threats, risks and vulnerabilities in the past decade
provides a clear picture of the difficult and complex situation currently facing
the State, which is affected by various forms of crime.

#### CHALLENGES FACING THE STATE

The security situation prevailing in the State of Guatemala, described above,
poses important trials and challenges to the Government and various State
agencies. Some that are highlighted, among others are:

###### LEGAL REFORMS

The structural changes that must be made to National Security System institutions are based on reforms to the following laws: National Civil Police Law (PNC
reform, creating the Criminal Investigation Police), Prison System Act (creation
of the National Institute of Corrections and Rehabilitation), and the General
Directorate of Immigration (creating the National Institute of Immigration and
Naturalization Service). These changes must be made in accordance with the
Covenant for Peace, Security and Justice, and the National Agreement for the
Advancement of Security and Justice, proposed to be signed by the three branches
of the State and the Attorney General.

###### STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP

A political leadership committed to strategic national objectives is required
to ensure the success of the National Security Policy; one that is able to build
consensus among different actors and sectors of society to protect life, property,
and the permanence of State institutions, and must be well-grounded in resultsbased management.


###### PREVENTING AND COMBATING CORRUPTION

To achieve the goals outlined in this Policy, it is necessary to prevent and combat
corruption and impunity within the legal framework. To regain the trust of the
population, it is also crucial to achieve efficiency and effectiveness indicators to
guarantee security and the prompt and effective administration of justice, while
keeping the social welfare of the population in mind.

###### REDUCING CRIME RATES

Institution building, comprehensive action from the Security and Justice
System, and citizen participation are fundamental to reducing crime rates. The
active participation of citizens, cooperation with authorities, and respect for the
law, are an essential part of strengthening the democratic system and the Rule
of Law.

###### CONTROL OF AIR, SEA, AND LAND SPACES

The State’s control of its territory is imperative to ensure governability and
democracy. In this regard, it is necessary to have adequate technological means
to exercise control, dissuasive power, and to counter the current threats facing
the State.

###### NATIONAL IDENTITY

National identity implies a sense of belonging, identity, ability to recognize
oneself as a member of a community, and being aware of one’s key role, which is
built in everyday life in a formative process from the relationship between social
actors. That is why the formation of the citizen is one of the most important
goals of democracy.

###### CONTROL OF ARMS, AMMUNITION, AND EXPLOSIVES

It is necessary to implement effective controls to counter illegal trafficking in
arms, ammunition, and explosives into the country, to reduce the proliferation
of firearms that endanger people’s lives and safety, since most violent deaths
result from the use of these weapons. This is meant to comply with the United
Nations conventions against Transnational Organized Crime and the InterAmerican Convention against the Manufacturing of and Illicit Trafficking in
Firearms, Ammunition, and other related materials. It is also important to comply
with the Arms and Ammunition Act to ensure the proper use of firearms, to help
improve the security of individuals and society in general.

## CHAPTER V. TRANSFORMATIONAL AXES AND  STRATEGIC GUIDELINES

#### TRANSFORMATIONAL AXES

The transformational process for achieving a “secure and prosperous Guatemala”
demands that resources be prioritized to ensure the protection of life, personal
property, democratic institutions, the Rule of Law, and human rights. Likewise, in
order to complement this national security effort, national identity, sustainable
development, promoting international cooperation in the peaceful settlement of
disputes, and contributing to the maintenance of international peace and security
are also essential.

A transformational axis is an element that defines the change process objective
and is formed in the center that governs decision-making; it establishes strategic
guidance and necessary action based on National Security Policy principles,
which in this case are as follows:

###### SOCIO-HUMAN

The person is the subject and object of this policy, considering that security is
related to human development, with its natural rights, collective welfare, equity,
and sustainability, so that one can free oneself from threats to life and property,
with freedom and integrity. In this context, the State must address the problems
concerning social conflict, as well as the restoration of the social fabric and national identity, based on inclusion and recognition of diversity, by meeting basic
needs. In this regard, success requires the participation of State institutions and
citizens at all levels in the areas of social and situational prevention.

###### POLITICAL-ECONOMIC

The development of this policy requires improving and adjusting the body
of law that governs the security and justice sector in order to complement the
actions necessary to achieve objectives.

Strengthening the State will facilitate the achievement of its goals and objectives,
particularly in the security framework that will bring about the conditions for
increasing economic activity, investment, and competitiveness, which will
facilitate the satisfaction of the people’s basic needs, decrease social inequality,
and will indirectly reduce crime rates.

Due to the above, it will be possible to have the resources necessary for the proper
implementation of this Policy and to increase them by means of specific taxes.
International cooperation resources must be redirected, reconciled, and appro

-----

###### ENVIRONMENT

The progressive destruction of the environment, caused by agricultural border
expansion, inadequate exploitation of renewable and non-renewable natural
resources, as well as inadequate social and productive interactions concerning
the environment, threaten the existence of resources for future generations.

The actions of National Security System institutions and the participation of
communities, the private sector and the local authorities will be directed at
contributing to the protection of natural resources: forests, watersheds and lake
water, rainwater and groundwater sources, biodiversity, marine and coastal
zones, and archaeological and subsurface assets; through the observation, implementation and modernization of environmental regulations, to facilitate the
protection and exploitation of natural resources without causing social unrest
or affecting the health of the people.

The utilization of natural resources focused on proper land management directs
the socioeconomic processes in regard to the use and potential for different
soils and regions of the country, in order to improve the living conditions of the
population and reduce environmental pollution with comprehensive activities
that will address and overcome the consequences of climate change.

###### ENERGY

Despite having natural resources for the production of clean, low cost, electrical
energy that is in harmony with the environment, Guatemala is partially dependent
on the generation of fossil fuels (oil and coal) that makes it vulnerable to price
fluctuations and international supply availability.

To overcome this vulnerability, it is necessary to enhance and protect the infrastructure and natural resources to ensure national energy matrix development,
to strengthen energy independence, and to improve economic activity and quality
of life for the population.

###### GEOSTRATEGIC

Guatemala’s geographical position allows access to the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea, with proximity to the largest market in the world composed of the
countries belonging to the North America Free Trade Agreement and the countries
of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum. This provides an opportunity
to develop a logistics, energy, and tourism infrastructure to strengthen its
economy. Likewise, its geographical position makes it vulnerable to natural
phenomena caused by climate change, hurricanes, floods, fires, and volcanic
eruptions, as well as drug trafficking, human trafficking and trafficking in arms,
ammunition, and explosives.

This makes it necessary to strengthen Guatemala’s participation in various
international security organizations to regionally contribute and confront different


###### TECHNOLOGY

Technology, as an ordered set of instruments, knowledge, procedures, and methods,
must serve the country in a collaborative manner to achieve its national objectives. In the security arena, it is especially relevant for peaceful coexistence,
tranquility, and national stability, as well as for the prevention of emergencies
or disasters, and support for the security and justice system, to prevent and
mitigate these situations with high technology products and systems.

Using modern technology is a necessary condition for human development to
ensure the provision of competitive services and food services. Competitiveness
must be based on technical progress and innovation through strategic alliances
focused on research leading to the development of products that allow us to
achieve national development in the shortest time possible.

###### FOOD

Guatemala is a forested country; however, most of the land is used for growing
agricultural exports, livestock, and subsistence farming. In regard to subsistence
farming, most of the rural population has high levels of poverty and malnutrition.

In this regard, it is essential to coordinate the efforts of public, private, and
international organizations in order to ensure the production and availability
of food. This will allow everyone access to food in the quantity and quality that
is culturally appropriate, emphasizing the most vulnerable members of society;
the elderly, women, and children[20]; in order to maintain a healthy and active life.

Generating community, public, and civic security conditions will improve the
national and international investment to generate employment opportunities in
rural areas, which will increase the productive capacity and purchasing power
of the people to overcome the dietary crisis that causes malnutrition; primarily
in communities affected by persistent droughts and extreme poverty.

###### INTELLIGENCE

Qualitative and professional development of the National Intelligence System is
indispensable to the effectiveness of this Policy and the National Security System.
Making this a reality will allow the State to avail itself of timely, accurate, and
relevant information to use for analysis and transformation into a useful product
for threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. This will help to efficiently and effectively
develop a transformational axis and strengthen the State’s capability to safeguard
individuals, institutions, and sensitive information against hostile agents who
seek to hinder the achievement of national objectives.


-----

#### STRATEGIC GUIDELINES

Development of transformational axes will be accomplished by establishing
strategic guidelines that define standards or criteria to help guide decisions
regarding the guidelines necessary to achieve established objectives. Strategic
guidelines are defined by the following agenda: institutionalization, internal
security, external security, risk management and civil defense, and intelligence.

The five strategic guidelines described below were developed based on rigorous
analytical modeling of the interrelated causes of insecurity in Guatemala. Each
corresponds to a specific segment, which utilizes criteria from institutional
responsibilities. Thus, strategic guidelines should be considered as mutually
complementary, whereby the success of one is added to and completed in the
success of others, and therefore it demands the Government’s comprehensive
efforts to implement them.

###### STRATEGIC GUIDELINE: INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY SYSTEM

Institutional weakness, little territorial presence, high levels of corruption and
impunity, deficient human resource professionalization in the institutions that
make up the Security and Justice System, as well as the limited allocation of
financial resources and the actions of organized crime, create a deficiency in the
performance of the system’s functions, particularly in the ability to protect life,
liberty, justice, and ensuring the peaceful coexistence of the population.

In this regard, the strengthening of the institutions that make up the National
Security System is focused on transforming and generating better public services,
making more effective decisions regarding the allocation of resources, and is in
consonance with proposals made in the socio-human and political-economic
transformational axes.

This will be achieved through the allocation of adequate resources, changes in
legislation, professionalization of human resources, reform of internal decisionmaking processes, and planning, management, and evaluation, which will improve
society’s image of State institutions and the quality of response to crime.

###### Objective: To develop and strengthen the institutions of the  National Security System (NSS).

This is proposed in order to strengthen the institutional capabilities of the NSS
and National Security Council agencies, to achieve effective, efficient, and coordinated operation, and to ensure individual security, freedom, the Rule of Law,
human rights, and democratic institutions.

The following program actions will be undertaken to achieve this objective, in
view of the respective indicators, to ensure the simultaneous and coordinated

###### STRATEGIC GUIDELINE: EXTERNAL SECURITY

External security is defending Guatemala’s independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, peace, and the preservation and strengthening of international
relations. Responsibility for External Security is the responsibility of the President of the Republic through the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and National
Defense.[21].

Its purpose is to identify, prevent and counter the threats and risks that affect Guatemala’s security and have an external origin. Among these threats are
transnational organized crime, primarily manifested by drug trafficking, trafficking of people and illicit arms, money laundering, and terrorism. Such threats
exceed the capabilities of the State because of its inability to control the country, among other factors.

Also, under the multidimensional approach to security, traditional threats remain dormant, so it is appropriate to mention the conflicts that could arise from
the exploitation of natural strategic resources in the border areas for the benefit
of the country’s energy and technology security.

It is essential to improve the country’s external defense to protect Guatemala’s
independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, peace, and international relations with a transformative impact on the geostrategic environment. Efforts to
maintain external security are supported by treaties and international cooperation.

###### Objective: Contribute to the exercise of sovereignty, the defense  of territorial integrity, and the promotion and maintenance of in- ternational peace and security to create an environment in which Guatemala can achieve its national interests.

The following program will be undertaken to achieve this goal, in view of the
respective indicators shown in the following table.

|PROGRAM ACTIONS|INDICATORS|

###### STRATEGIC GUIDELINE: PROACTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT AND CIVIL DEFENSE

The National Coordinator for Disaster Reduction (CONRED) oversees the area
of risk management and civil defense. This refers to events of a natural, social,
and technological order that can affect people, property, and their surroundings.
CONRED seeks to predict and prevent disasters, limit and reduce the damage
from such disasters, and perform appropriate response and recovery actions.

The scope of this strategic guideline aims to comply with the requirements
for environmental, food, and technology safety and security actions, consistent
with and articulated in their respective transformational axes.

###### STRATEGIC GUIDELINE: NATIONAL STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE

National intelligence is the State’s institutional capability under the law to
provide timely, accurate, and relevant information for decision-making, in order
to provide national security by completing the intelligence cycle.

It is an organized and continuous process of observation and analysis of the
security environment, to know and interpret it, and to facilitate in deciding and
acting effectively in the political-strategic context.

The intent of this guideline is to gain greater knowledge that facilitates the
efficient implementation of program activities developed in the socio-human,
political-economic, environmental, energy, strategic environment, technology,
food, and intelligence axes. This will be accomplished through the professionalization of the human resource system, methodologies, technology, and communication and interagency coordination spaces.

###### Objective: To provide the State with a National Intelligence System that can produce an impact on executive level decision-making based on the intelligence gathered.

The following program will be undertaken to achieve this goal, in view of the

## CHAPTER VI. CHANGE MANAGEMENT,  ASSESSMENT PROCESS, AND  SOCIAL COMMUNICATION

#### CHANGE MANAGEMENT

The changes proposed by the National Security Policy will be made through
public administration that focuses its efforts in directing all human, financial,
and technological resources, whether internal or external, towards achieving
security and development results, which incorporates an organized use of policies,
strategies, resources, and processes to improve decision-making, transparency,
and accountability.

This approach is designed to ensure consistency and coherence between the
nation’s strategic objectives and results and the tasks of each of its institutions,
through the systematization and monitoring of security indicators that provide
an integrated view of the results derived from political-strategic and budgetary
decisions, with respect to National Security.

Its success entails professional competencies and techniques, “a change of
attitude, positive thinking and an effort toward national transformation.”[24]

The Professional Career Field for the National Security System will be the
responsibility of the National Security Council through the Advisory and Planning
Commission. The professional career field is mandatory and shall include
education, training, professionalization, punishment, removal, evaluation, and
promotion, in order to ensure that the personnel from the different components
of the National Security System are appropriately qualified, service-minded,
and ethical in the performance of their duties, with respect to the specialized
area of each institution.

The National Institute for Strategic Security Studies (NISSS) provides the
training, professionalization, and specialization for the ideal national security
personnel through the direction and coordination with different State educational institutions in the security field, to promote bachelor, master, and
doctoral degree programs.[25]

24   Constitutional President of the Republic of Guatemala, Inaugural Address, January 14, 2012.


-----

#### EVALUATION PROCESS

The “results-based management” model will be applied to allow for the evaluation
of quantitative and qualitative results, the scope and effect of implementation at
various execution levels, as well as for cost-effectiveness analysis.

The Technical Secretariat for the National Security Council will provide the
corresponding follow-up to this Policy and shall report to the National Security
Council on the progress of the strategic guidelines, objectives, and actions.
Moreover, it will provide a critical analysis of the positive and negative actions
for updating implementation plans and programs.

The General Inspectorate for the National Security System is responsible for
ensuring compliance with the system’s internal controls and shall submit
recurring reports to the National Security Council. It will functionally coordinate its work with the inspectorates and control agencies from the ministries
and institutions that make up the National Security System to ensure the
efficiency and effectiveness of the organization, with respect to the legality and
transparency of their activities in the use of allocated resources.

The Congress and the Judicial Branch shall perform the National Security System’s external democratic controls, through their corresponding organizations
and through a public social review. Also, a system shall be implemented that
integrates data related to organized and common crime and its victims, which
will be published periodically. [26] It should encourage participation to ensure
citizen control over public action and the impact on the design, implementation
and evaluation process of public policies in the national security arena.

This information is important for evaluating the concrete results of program
actions to demonstrate the value that each responsible institution adds to the
security-building process. As a whole, these indicators define what still needs to
be achieved in order to produce the desired security conditions in Guatemala.

Citizen control is, among other mechanisms, an integrated space consisting
of representatives from the organizational levels of Guatemalan society to
perform a social review of the National Security System, among other functions,
irrespective of the external control that other organizations, institutions, or
individuals may exercise.[27]

The Public Safety Observatory will be implemented to facilitate citizen control,
which is an area to address issues related to National Security Policy.

26   National Agreement for the Advancement of Security and Justice, Concession 49 and 50.


#### SOCIAL COMMUNICATION

A communication strategy will be designed to enable all stakeholders, including
the public, to know the content of the Policy, the progress in its implementation,
and the results achieved. This strategy should define the different media that will
be used for dissemination and outreach, with the goal of improving the public’s
perception of security issues.

## GLOSSARY

**Collective Security: the manner of confronting aggression from one State**
against the territorial integrity or inviolability, sovereignty, or political independence of another State.

**Cooperative Security: describes a broad group of international mechanisms,**
and generally refers to the terms under which States cooperate to deter, prevent,
detect, or deal with violence and aggression.

It incorporates three types of mechanisms: a) measures to strengthen trust,
such as information on military doctrine, size, and strength of the armed forces,
or defense spending, and it is reinforced with frequent contacts between those
that dictate defense policies and those that lead the armed forces; b) measures
designed to resolve disputes peacefully: negotiation, mediation, conciliation,
arbitration, judicial settlement of disputes, or filing appeals with multilateral
organizations (UN and OAS), to secure peaceful settlement, and c) the use of
joint forces to stop international aggression. Collective security mechanisms
should be distinguished from military alliances as such; they are formed to
maintain a global balance of power against a common enemy.

**Critical Infrastructure: the facilities, systems, networks, hardware, services,**
and information technology, whose disabling or destruction would have a
negative impact on the population, public health, security, economic activity,
environment, free movement, democratic governance, and effective functioning
of the State.

**External security: the area of external security includes risks and threats to**
the State resulting from external factors. In this regard, the assets to protect are
Guatemala’s independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, peace, and international relations.

**Femicide: violent death of women occurring in the context of unequal power**
relationships between men and women, in the exercise of power and dominance
against women.

**Hemispheric Security: is mutual assistance to face an attack in the exercise**
of the imminent right of legitimate individual or collective defense recognized
by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations. Hemispheric security
provides that an armed attack by any State against an American State shall be
considered an attack against all the American States, and therefore, each of the


-----

**Intelligence Cycle: The set of activities undertaken by the National Intelli-**
gence System institutions which includes: planning, identifying, collecting,
processing, analyzing, producing, distributing, and disseminating information
in a timely manner for decision-making at the highest level of the National
Security System.

**Intelligence System: is the set of institutions, procedures, and rules that**
deal with the threats and risks to national security in a preventive manner, through
the necessary coordination of the functions of strategic, civil, and military
intelligence, as well as each one of them in its own domain.

**Internal security: the field of internal security includes the risks and threats**
from common and organized crime. In this respect, the assets to protect are
mainly related to the life, physical integrity, patrimony, and exercise of the
rights and freedoms recognized by the Constitution of the Republic of Guatemala to the inhabitants of the country.

**National Security Council: permanently established to coordinate within**
the National Security System, define strategies and policies, and advise the
President in making security decisions. It is chaired by the President, who
makes all decisions.

**National Security System: the institutional, instrumental, and functional**
framework available to the State to meet the security challenges it encounters
through interagency coordination at the highest level. It is subject to democratic
controls and it includes the areas of internal and external security, state intelligence, and risk management and civil defense.

**Organized criminal group or criminal organization: an organized criminal**
group or criminal organization is considered to be any structured group of three
or more persons, existing for a certain period of time and acting in concert with
the purpose of committing one or more of the offenses listed in the Organized
Crime Act, in order to obtain, directly or indirectly, a financial gain of any kind
for themselves or for a third party.

**Risks and Threats Agenda: consists of the current list of topics resulting**
from ongoing analysis. It identifies threats, vulnerabilities, and risks to national
security, public welfare, and the development of society and the stability of its
institutions. Its effects should be avoided and controlled by the respective institutions and were not captured in the Development Agenda.

**Risk Management and Civil Defense: the field of risk management and civil**
defense, under the responsibility of the National Coordinator for Disaster Reduction (CONRED), refers to the events of a natural, social, and technological
order that can affect the population or their property and surroundings. CONRED
seeks to predict and prevent disasters, limit and reduce damage from such
isasters, and perform the appropriate response and recovery actions.


**State Intelligence: the State’s ability to articulate information and intelli-**
gence on internal and external threats, risks, and vulnerabilities within
the functions established in this law. It acts under the responsibility of the
President, through the Secretary of State for Strategic Intelligence.

**Strategic natural resource: all scarce natural resources that are vital or**
potentially vital for economic development or to maintain a country’s quality
of life.

**Strategic Security Agenda: is the mechanism by which the State establishes**
thematic relevance in the overall area of security; defines and prioritizes instruments of a preventive or reactive nature to ensure national security.

**Strategic Security Plan: determines the set of actions that should be under-**
taken by National Security System institutions to maintain national security.
It contains the mission, key actions, strategies, and objectives of the National
Security System, based on the National Strategic Security Agenda and the Risk
and Threat Agenda.
