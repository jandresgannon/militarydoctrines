# GUIDELINES OF THE MINISTER OF NATIONAL DEFENCE FOR
 2009-2014

**INTRODUCTION**

1. The Guidelines of the Minister of National Defence (hereinafter referred to as the
_“Guidelines”) is a medium-term (six-year) planning document which is prepared in accordance_
with the Lithuanian National Security Strategy, Lithuanian Military Strategy, National Defence
System Development Programme, NATO Strategic Concept, NATO Comprehensive Political
Guidance, the European Union (hereinafter referred to as the EU) document “Headline Goal
2010”, and collective and international commitments assumed by Lithuania. The Guidelines are
revised as necessary, at least every three years.

2. The purpose of the Guidelines is to establish the main goals and directions of the
development of the National Defence System (hereinafter referred to as the NDS) of Lithuania as a
member state of NATO and the EU, to ensure effective functioning of the NDS and implementation
of the tasks, assigned to the Lithuanian Armed Forces (hereinafter referred to as the LAF). The
Guidelines also define the national level of ambitions, provide for the priorities of the development
of the NDS and set forth the general provisions of the future commitments related to the
membership in NATO and the EU.

3. Taking into account decreasing financing of the NDS due to the economic crisis and
changes in the strategic security environment, and in accordance with the provisions of the
Resolution of the Seimas of the Republic of Lithuania “Regarding the Programme of the
Government of the Republic of Lithuania” (Official Gazette, 2008, No. 146–5870) of 9 December
2008 and the Resolution No. 189 of the Government of the Republic of Lithuania “Regarding the
Approval of the Implementation Measures of the 2008–2012 Programme of the Government of the
Republic of Lithuania” of 25 February 2009 (Official Gazette, 2009, No. 33–1268) on the
development of the NDS, the aim of the present Guidelines is to update the Guidelines of the
Minister of National Defence for 2009–2014 approved by the Order No. V–166 of the Minister of
National Defence of 29 February 2008.

4. The Guidelines provide for the priorities of the NDS operation and planning directions
which in the time of the economic crisis could help to avoid potential negative impact on the
military capabilities of Lithuania, and would create favourable conditions for further
implementation of the NDS objectives after the economic crisis. The Guidelines are drafted in
accordance with the following principles:

4.1. _balance between national needs and international commitments._ Membership in NATO
provides Lithuania with credible collective defence guaranties, however, it does not exempt
Lithuania from responsibility to prepare for national defence individually or in cooperation with the
Allies. In addition to the ehancement of military capabilities, necessary for national defence,
Lithuania has to ensure proportional contribution to the development of NATO collective defence
capabilities and to contribute to international efforts to ensure peace and stability beyond the
Alliance territory;

4.2. _continuity._ It is necessary to continue the fundamental directions of Lithuanian defence
policy and aim at implementing long-term objectives of the NDS development by further pursuing
the defence reform and military transformation;

4.3. _planning under crisis conditions._ Taking into account difficult economic situation of the
state and reduced financing of the NDS, short-term and mid-term development objectives are
formulated so as to match the NDS finances available. With the view of overcoming the economic
crisis and increasing budgetary appropriations allocated to the Ministry of National Defence, the
provisions of the Guidelines are to be revised and updated.


-----

**I. NATIONAL DEFENCE SYSTEM GOALS IN THE TIME OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS**

5. Lithuanian defence reform and the development of the NDS are designated to create
capabilities that would effectively respond to the threats and challenges to Lithuania and the
Alliance. The economic crisis and reduced financing of the NDS may have a negative impact on the
defence reform and the implementation of the objectives of the NDS development, however:

5.1. every effort has to be made to reform the LAF so that by the end of 2014 approximately 10
percent of the land forces could be sustained in international operations and 50 percent of them
would be appropriately organized and trained to be deployed outside Lithuania;

5.2. special attention has to be paid and additional measures have to be taken for the LAF to
prepare and constantly sustain a battalion-size combat unit of high-level readiness, prepared to
rapidly respond to the violations of the sovereignity of the Republic of Lithuania;

in accordance with the procedures established by legislation, the LAF must be able to provide
support to Guidelines of the Minister of National Defence for 2009–2014

5.3. state and municipal institutions.

6. Taking into account the changes in the strategic security environment, the provisions of the
Programme of the Government of the Republic of Lithuania and the financial restrictions of the
NDS, it is necessary to draft, update and supplement the legislation and other documents regulating
the NDS, its activities and development, as follows:

6.1. assess and, if necessary, revise the provisions of the National Security Strategy;

6.2. revise the Lithuanian Military Strategy;

6.3. revise the National Defence System Development Programme;

6.4. draft and approve Lithuanian Military Doctrine;

6.5. draft and approve a long-term defence planning document which would define long-term
defence planning assumptions;

6.6. draft legislation regulating the development of the mobilization system and planning of
reserve in accordance with the requirements of national and collective defence;

6.7. draft legislation and documents regulating the development of specific capabilities (host
nation support, air defence);

6.8. draft concepts that would enable the development of Network Enabled Capability,
integrated Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) system and
modern capabilities of Advanced Individual Combat System.

7. Due to the economic situation in the country, the activities of the NDS shall be directed
towards the maintenance of the already established Lithuanian military capabilities and the
implementation of the assumed international commitments. In order to sustain military capabilities
and fulfil international commitments, in the period of economic crisis the priority shall be given to
the following activities of the NDS (in order of priority):

7.1. prepare for and participate in international operations, paying special attention to the
NATO-led operation in Afganistan;

7.2. prepare for and participate in NATO NRF and the EU Battlegroups stand-by;

7.3. organize combat training for the LAF units, especially for participation in international
operations;

7.4. provide host nation support for NATO‘ air policing mission in the Baltic states;


-----

7.5. exercise search and rescue tasks in the defined area of responsibility;

7.6. carry out surveillance of airspace and territorial sea, and surveillance and control of the
EEZ (exceptional economic zone) and coastal shelf;

7.7. maintain service-worthy and serviceable weaponry, military equipment and infrastructure
of the LAF;

7.8. organize training of the military personnel in the Lithuanian military training institutions.

**II. NATIONAL DEFENCE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AFTER THE ECONOMIC CRISIS**

8. The economic crisis affects and modifies short-term and mid-term development of the NDS
and the terms of its implementation, however, it does not eliminate the necessity to plan long-term
capabilities of Lithuania and to pursue the general objectives of the defence reform and the NDS
development. While directing the NDS activities towards the maintenance of the existing military
capabilities in the short-term period, it is also necessary to prepare to continue the development of
the NDS after the economic crisis, paying the major attention to the following underlying
objectives:

8.1. prepare an infantry battalion (and necessary combat support and combat service support
units) which would be able to carry out combat actions and tasks in Lithuania and participate in
international operations;

8.2. integrate the national airspace surveillance and control system into the NATO Integrated
Air Defence System;

8.3. carry out peacetime tasks within the country.

9. In developing military capabilities more attention must be payed to: the enhancement of the
host nation support and the LAF intelligence and reconnaissance; combat preparation of active
reserve; and anti-air and anti-tank weaponry, as well as the preparation of appropriate personnel.

10. In accordance with the objectives of the defence reform and the process of military
transformation, an infantry brigade for the defence of the country and the implementation of
international commitments must be gradually prepared.

**III. NATIONAL DEFENCE SYSTEM MANAGEMENT REFORM AND MILITARY**
**TRANSFORMATION**

11. The purpose of the NDS management reform is to create an effective management system of
the NDS institutions, that would ensure efficient decision-making and implemention, and rational
use of the NDS financial and human resources. To this end:

11.1. the functions and tasks of the NDS institutions shall be revised and the management shall
be optimized;

11.2. the management processes of the NDS financial, material and human resources shall be
analyzed and, on the basis of the analysis results, a common information system for the
management of these areas shall be installed.

12. The implementation of the NDS management reform during the economic crisis has to
create conditions for a more effective functioning of the NDS and help to prepare for the
continuation of the NDS development after this period.

13. The NDS management reform is closely related to the LAF transformation. In order to attain
the objectives of the management reform and military transformation, it is necessary to ensure that
both processes are consistent and concerted.


-----

14. Under conditions of the economic crisis, the NDS is not capable of ensuring consistent
implementation of all the objectives of military transformation, nevertheless, it is necessary to
continue military transformation by regularly assessing its results and, when required, specifying
the plans of implementation.

15. In the nearest future, the priorities of planning and performance management shall be the
following:

15.1. prepare and approve a detailed plan of capabilities-based planning process and all the
methodical material necessary for its implementation;

15.2. draft and/or improve legislation regulating the system of Planning, programming and
budgeting, so that they reflect the capabilities planned by the NDS;

15.3. carry out performance audit and, on the basis of its results, improve processes in the fields
of property, financial and personnel management;

15.4. create and install the information system of resource management;

15.5. optimize the management of the NDS infrastructure.

16. Transformation in the above mentioned areas should help not only to attain the objectives of
the defence reform but also to create preconditions for a more effective use of the NDS resources.

**IV. PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING**

17. Personnel policy of the NDS must create preconditions for ensuring the fulfilment of
Lithuania’s commitments to NATO and the EU (the development of the armed forces so as to
comply with the requirements of efficiency, command and control laid out in the Lithuanian
Military Strategy) and effective use of available human resources. During the economic crisis the
planning and use of human resources must be rational and effective and correspond with the
financial capacities.

18. The management of the NDS human resources must be reoriented towards strategic human
resource management, i.e. active participation in the management of an institution and contribution
to the achievement of its strategic goals and the adjustment to the shifting requirements of the
environment and structural changes. Human resource planning must be integrated into the general
resource planning system and directed towards capability-planning (creating new capabilities and
retaining the present ones), ensuring rational estimation of quantitive and qualitative needs.

19. In order to ensure the manning of the LAF with the servicemen of professional military
service and volunteer military service (active reserve), it is necessary to:

19.1. reorganize and optimize the system of military conscription administration so that it would
ensure intensive and purposeful search, agitation and selection of prospective candidates to the
professional military service and volunteer military service;

19.2. create the system of search, attraction and selection to the professional military service and
volunteer military service, the goal of which would be to satisfy quantative and qualitative
personnel needs;

19.3. optimize the number of positions for officers, non-commissioned officers, sergeants and
privates in order to establish a larger number of positions for privates in the professional military
service;

19.4. implement the measures increasing the motivation to serve in the professional military
service and reducing personnel turnover. During the economic crisis, the priority must be given to
non-financial motivational measures;


-----

19.5. carry out an analysis and set separate measures to stengthen the motivation to serve in the
National Defence Volunteer Forces.

20. According to the needs of the armed forces based on the professional and volunteer military
service, the system of military education and combat training shall be reformed, focussing on
training and educating servicemen and future leaders able to adapt to changing situations. To this
end, the following is required:

20.1. creation of the system of planning personnel training and education demands and
organizing personnel training which would ensure that the personell is qualitatively and rationally
prepared to perform their functions;

20.2. clearly defined strategic, operational and tactical level functions and responsibilities;

20.3. optimization of the institutions of individual and combat training; assignment of optimal
training capabilities and necessary material resources, retaining the infrastructure and personnel of
the basic military training;

20.4. development of the system of preparation of lower grade servicemen-specialists in the

Training Regiment of the Training and Personnel Command.

21. The education system of the General Jonas Žemaitis Lithuanian Military Academy shall be
reformed so that the prospective officers receive military training and higher education meeting the
requirements of the LAF. In order to ensure qualified and qualitative military training, the personnel
of military training must be comprised of professional military servicemen, who have practical
military experience and knowledge of modern warfare acquired in foreign and Lithuanian education
institutions. Graduates of the General Jonas Žemaitis Lithuanian Military Academy must be
employed in the NDS only in accordance with the established demand and cadets’ rating.

22. Implementing the measures provided in the career conceptions, the planning and
organization of servicemen’s career shall be reformed in order to create opportunities to pursue
career according to the professional potential and abilities and to ensure the establishment of
effective and transparent selection system based on the assessment of servicemen’s activities,
personal features and potentials.

**V. PREPARING CITIZENS FOR NATIONAL DEFENCE**

23. Transition to the armed forces based on the professional and volunteer military service has
created a necessity to provide the citizens of Lithuania with appropriate and attractive opportunities
for voluntary preparation for national defence and to pay more attention to fostering citizens’ will
and abilities to defend their country. To this end:

23.1. strategy of military training for citizens shall be prepared;

23.2. in cooperation with the Lithuanian Riflemen Union and the Ministry of Education and
Science schoolchildren and youth shall be provided with civic and patriotic education on national
defence;

23.3. citizens and associations shall be encouraged to take part in voluntary non-professional
activities related to national defence;

23.4. associations providing public education related to national defence and thus contributing
to the strengthening of the national security shall be encouraged to expand their activities;

24. Considering limited financial capacities of the Ministry of National Defence, the support
shall be provided consistently and purposefully only to those initiatives fostering public spirit and
patriotism and providing military training that directly correspond to the objectives and needs of the
NDS.

**VI. MANAGEMENT OF APPROPRIATIONS ALLOCATED TO THE MINISTRY OF**
**NATIONAL DEFENCE, AND PROCUREMENT**

25. Under conditions of the economic crisis, planning the distribution of the budgetary
approprioations assigned to the NDS, there is no possibility to keep formerly defined proportions of
expense allocations, consistent with the standarts of other NATO countries. The priority of
financing must be given to the maintenance of the underlying capabilities.

26. All the allocations assigned to the NDS must be used as rationally as possible; however, if
required, expense allocations must be firstly reduced in the areas directly unrelated or minimally
contributing to the maintenance of military capabilities, i.e.:

26.1. expenses related to the exploitation and maintenance of prospectless infrastructure,
weaponry and military equipment;

26.2. expenses related to the activities of artistic collectives and military orchestras, publishing
activities and sports events;

26.3. expenses related to military education in foreign institutions of military education;

26.4. expenses on providing support to other state and municipal institutions.

27. In order to economy the financial resources:

27.1. in the nearest future every effort shall be made to ensure further implementation of the
armed forces’ modernization projects the agreements on which have already been signed, while the
launch of new high-value procurements shall be postponed to the period after the economic crisis;

27.2. the peacetime tasks of the LAF shall be assessed, considering the possibility to relinquish
some of them (e.g., the continuous mine-clearing of the territory of Lithuania, the protection of the
airspace over the nuclear power station of Ignalina, the protection of prospectless infrastructure,
etc.);

27.3. it is necessary to search for the ways to reduce the expenses on the maintenance of
infrastructure by disposing the prospectless facilities and by concentrating military units into
integrated territories.

28. Taking into account the planned increase of the NDS financing after the economic crisis, the
priorities of providing the armed forces with the modern equipment shall be given to:

28.1. the combat systems (combat manoeuvring, combat support, individual armament and
protection systems);

28.2. armed forces’ command and control, computers and communications, information
gathering, surveillance, intelligence and reconnaisance equipment (command information systems,
comunications equipment, ISTAR);

28.3. air-lift systems (helicopters).

29. In order to reach more effectiveness, flexibility and transparency in planning and
implementing procurements:

29.1. the services of NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency shall be used more often and on a
more larger scale, including e-commerce possibilities;

29.2. the possibility of purchasing used weaponry and military equipment the operation validity
of which is still in effect from partners or manufacturers shall be considered as an acceptable
alternative;


-----

29.3. every effort shall be made to sign long-term agreements on annual regular procurements
(e.g., outfit, fuel, ammunition, spare parts, etc.) on the basis of which it would be possible to make
orders according to the changing needs and financing;

29.4. in order to reach the compatibility of weaponry and military equipment, purchase
agreements shall provide for the extension of the agreements and for purchasing additional
quantities of equipment;

29.5. assessingof the bids the criterion of economic usefulness shall be applied more widely
than the lowest price criterion;

30. After the economic crisis and the increase of the NDS financing, the proportions of expense
allocations shall be returened to the standards of NATO member states.
