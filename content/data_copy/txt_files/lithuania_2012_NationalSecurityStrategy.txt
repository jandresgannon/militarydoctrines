**NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY**

**I. GENERAL PROVISIONS**

1. The National Security Strategy represents a set of provisions defining the development

of a secure state. The National Security Strategy establishes the vital and primary national

security interests, the key risks, dangers and threats posed to these interests, presents the

priorities, as well as long- and medium-term objectives of the national security system

development, foreign, defence and domestic policies. This Strategy is based on the Constitution

of the Republic of Lithuania, the Law of the Republic of Lithuania on the Basics of National

Security (hereinafter referred to as the “Law on the Basics of National Security”), treaties of the

North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union.

2. The Republic of Lithuania perceives its national security as preservation of national

security interests. National security of the Republic of Lithuania is a constituent part of the

indivisible security policy of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (hereinafter referred to as

“NATO”) and the European Union (hereinafter referred to as the “EU”), is based on the security

guarantees embedded in NATO and EU treaties, the threat analysis, strategic goals and activity

guidelines provided in the strategic security policy documents of NATO and the EU.

3. In shaping and implementing national security policy, the Republic of Lithuania acts in

compliance with the universally recognised international legal norms, principles and

commitments embedded in the documents of the United Nations Organization (hereinafter

referred to as the “UN”), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (hereinafter

referred to as the “OSCE”) and the Council of Europe, and contributes to sustaining international

peace and comprehensive security based on democratic values, law and justice.


-----

**II. BASIC ASSUMPTIONS OF NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY**

4. National security is the basis for the prosperity of the State. Only a secure environment

is capable of ensuring the functioning of a mature democratic constitutional order, sustainable

economic growth, protection of human rights and freedoms, viability of civil society. The

necessary condition of national security is contribution of civic-minded citizens to creation of the

country’s security and welfare, their preparedness to contribute to its defence under critical

circumstances.

5. Security is indivisible, that is, national security is an integral part of regional, European

and global security. The Republic of Lithuania implements national security policy

independently, in co-operation with other states and through international organisations. With a

view to defending its national security interests, the Republic of Lithuania must be prepared to

address developments in the global security environment and contribute to the international

community’s efforts in spreading security and stability.

6. The following key factors are likely to shape the security environment of the Republic

of Lithuania in the long term:

6.1. development of the Euro-Atlantic community and global security processes affecting

the security environment of the Republic of Lithuania through its membership in NATO, the EU,

the UN and other international organisations;

6.2. developments taking place in an environment close to the Euro-Atlantic community,

especially in the Eastern neighbourhood;

6.3. remaining conventional and non-conventional security challenges;

6.4. enhanced possibilities to shape security environment in the course of the

globalisation process by economic ties and advanced technologies and the concurrently

increasing political, economic, social and technological vulnerability of states;

6.5. possible fluctuations and instability in international financial markets, global

economy.

**III. NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS OF THE REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA**

7. Vital interests of national security are the interests which are safeguarded employing

all lawful means and whose violation would pose a serious threat to the existence of the State of

Lithuania and its society. The vital interests of the Republic of Lithuania are:

7.1. sovereignty, territorial integrity, democratic constitutional order;

7.2. civil society, respect for human and citizen’s rights and freedoms and their

protection;


-----

7.3. peace and welfare in the State.

8. The primary interests of national security are the interests a failure to defend which

would eventually result in a violation of the vital interests of the Republic of Lithuania. The

primary interests of the Republic of Lithuania are:

8.1. viability of NATO and the EU, security, democracy and welfare of all states of the

Euro-Atlantic community;

8.2. democracy, freedom, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in the

neighbouring states,

8.3. global and regional security and stability;

8.4. credible national defence capabilities, supported by national defence financing which

meets the needs of defence and commitments to allies;

8.5. economic and energy security;

8.6. security of the infrastructure of the economic sectors of strategic importance to

national security;

8.7. information security;

8.8. cyber security;

8.9. ethnic and cultural identity;

8.10. a region secure from the ecological and public health point of view .

**IV. RISKS, DANGERS AND THREATS TO NATIONAL SECURITY**

9. Favourable internal and external factors are functioning of democratic institutions,

protection of rights and freedoms of citizens, exercise of the civilian control of the Armed

Forces, respect of the international community for the independence of the Republic of

Lithuania, an open, transparent, non-confrontational security policy pursued by the Republic of

Lithuania, membership in NATO, the EU and other international security organisations, friendly

inter-state relations. However, the State may face the challenges of consolidation of the national

budget and sustainability of public finances. Although there is no direct military threat to the

sovereignty and territorial integrity of the State, a dynamic, complex and difficult to predict

security environment poses certain external and internal risks, dangers and threats to the national

security interests of the Republic of Lithuania.

10. The external risks, dangers and threats which must be given particular attention by

the institutions ensuring national security are as follows:

10.1. economic and energy dependence – dominance of economic entities of other states

in the economic sectors of strategic importance for national security (energy, transport, finances


-----

and crediting), isolation of the energy sector from the energy networks and systems of the EU,

dependence of natural gas supply on a single external supplier and the remaining connection of

the electricity system with the post-Soviet space;

10.2. _development of nuclear energy in the region disregarding international nuclear_

_energy safety standards when designing, constructing and operating nuclear energy facilities_

without performing a detailed environmental impact assessment;

10.3. _activities of other states against the Republic of Lithuania – efforts to exert an_

impact on the political system, military capabilities, social and economic life, cultural identity of

the Republic of Lithuania, actions of intelligence services against the Republic of Lithuania and

international organisations a member of which the Republic of Lithuania is;

10.4. information attacks – actions of state and non-state entities in the international and

national information space aimed at spreading biased and misleading information, shaping a

negative public opinion in respect of interests of national security of the Republic of Lithuania;

10.5. _cyber attacks – attacks on electronic communications networks and information_

systems aimed at disturbing the functioning of the infrastructure of economic sectors of strategic

importance for national security and activities of state institutions of importance for national

security, obtaining of classified information, committing other criminal acts and thus impairing

the security of the State and its citizens.

11. Other external risks, dangers and threats capable of affecting national security of the

Republic of Lithuania to a considerable extent:

11.1. traditional manifestations of power politics – the growing military power of some

states of the region, the tendencies of its demonstration, threatening to use it or the cases of its

use;

11.2. _weakening of the Euro-Atlantic community – global or regional processes which_

could weaken ties of the Euro-Atlantic community, NATO’s collective defence commitments,

the EU’s capacities to implement a common policy;

11.3. _non-transparent, undemocratic integration projects in the neighbouring countries_

_not based on the free will of citizens of those states;_

11.4. _long-term impact of the global economic and financial crisis on the economic_

powers of the country, business development potential and implementation of public policy, also

the remaining likelihood of new economic and financial crises;

11.5. global and regional instability – political, economic, social instability, violations of

human rights and fundamental freedoms in neighbouring countries, problems of failed and

failing states, unresolved frozen conflicts likely to have adverse effects on both the neighbouring

states, and wider international community;


-----

11.6. international terrorism may both pose a direct threat to the Republic of Lithuania

(the Republic of Lithuania may become a target for international terrorism, citizens of the

Republic of Lithuania, military personnel and civilians participating in international operations

may become victims of terrorist attacks abroad) and have an indirect impact (the Republic of

Lithuania may be used as a transit country for the movement of persons, funds or arms, and other

support for international terrorism);

11.7. _proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (including their components and_

_production technologies), the increasing number of states possessing or intending to acquire_

weapons of mass destruction, the possibility that such weapons or their production technologies

will be acquired by non-state entities (primarily terrorist groups);

11.8. international organised crime and other cross-border crimes – human trafficking,

smuggling, illicit trade in drugs, arms, dual-use items, money laundering, illegal immigration,

cyber crime and other criminal acts;

11.9. adverse effects of climate change.

12. The internal risks, dangers and threats which must be given particular attention by

institutions ensuring national security are as follows:

12.1. _uneven social and economic development – persisting or increasing disparities in_

the living standards among various social groups, which may promote distrust in state

institutions and the democratic political system, trigger political extremism, crime, social unrest,

etc.;

12.2. _corruption, which undermines legitimate interests of individuals and the State,_

discredits the principle of the rule of law, diminishes the trust of citizens in democratic values,

democratic authorities and reduces the country’s attractiveness for foreign investors;

12.3. high rates of emigration – the decrease of the total number of the population and

particularly the number of working-age residents, loss of tax payers and qualified specialists,

weakening emigrants’ ties with the Homeland, distancing of the emigrants from the political

processes taking place in Lithuania, lack of possibilities to actively participate in the political life

of the country.

13. Other internal risks, dangers and threats capable of affecting the national security of

the Republic of Lithuania to a considerable extent:

13.1. _insufficient defence financing,_ providing no possibilities for the development of

Lithuania’s military capabilities;

13.2. political radicalism and extremism – use of coercion in seeking to attain political or

ideological goals, incitement of social conflicts, ethnic discord and unrest, seeking to gain power


-----

by unlawful means, spread of radical and extremist ideologies, views discriminating certain

groups of society;

13.3. _economic vulnerability – monopolisation of individual economic sectors,_

insufficient diversification of export and investment, loss of international competitiveness,

technology gap, disturbances in the operation of facilities of the economic sectors of strategic

importance for national security, misuse of or failure to use these facilities thus violating

interests of the State, insufficient protection of these facilities;

13.4. _crime and shadow economy – their uncontrollable spread poses a threat to public_

security, has a negative effect on the country’s economic and political life;

13.5. _loss and/or disclosure of classified information – seizure, loss, destruction,_

damaging, collection, purchase, selling, keeping or dissemination of classified information;

13.6. value crisis – disrespect for human rights and freedoms, downgrading of Christian

values, family, liberal democracy and pluralistic society, spreading of anti-humanistic theories,

religious doctrines and ideologies diminishing or denying the value of human life, inciting racial,

national or religious discord, promoting or justifying violence, coercion and genocide;

13.7. _deterioration of the public health condition_ – spreading of dangerous diseases

(including AIDS), alcohol abuse, addiction to toxic substances, drug addiction;

13.8. state-level natural, technical, ecological or social emergencies.

**V. PRIORITIES AND TASKS OF NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY**

**IMPLEMENTATION**

14. The priorities and tasks of implementation of national security policy create

conditions for consistent implementation of the goal of national security policy as established in

the Law on the Basics of National Security, namely, through the concerted efforts of the State

and its citizens, to develop and strengthen democracy, to ensure the safe existence of the Nation

and internal and external security of the State, to deter any potential aggressor and to defend the

independence, territorial integrity and constitutional order of the State of Lithuania.

political, military, economic, social, cultural and other fields, develop co-operation within

international organisations, considering the strategic partnership with the USA to be one of the

most important tools of forming external security environment, and active membership of the

USA in NATO and its military presence in Europe – the key guarantee of security of the

Republic of Lithuania;

15.3.3. devote particular attention to bilateral and multilateral co-operation with the

Baltic States and Nordic countries in the security, political, educational and scientific, cultural,

economic, financial, energy, transport, environmental protection and other fields. The Republic

of Lithuania will seek that relations of these eight states and a more efficient use of resources

contribute to a successful representation of common interests in international organisations and

in other countries. The Republic of Lithuania will also seek a more active co-operation between

the Baltic States and Nordic countries in the field of security and defence, including possible

joint military projects whose implementation would enhance interoperability of the armed Forces

of Lithuania will seek to maintain good economic, commercial and cultural partnership relations


-----

with the Kaliningrad Oblast of the Russian Federation, seek to increasingly involve the

Kaliningrad Oblast in European co-operation and regional integration processes meeting the

national security interests of the Republic of Lithuania;

15.4. active participation in strengthening international security and stability. Acting as

an active and responsible member of the international community and recognising a close link

between peace and security, democracy, sustainable development and human rights, the

Republic of Lithuania will:

15.4.1. support the efforts of the international community in consolidating the principles

and practice of democracy, sustainable development, free market, rule of law, good governance,

transparency and accountability, defend the fundamental human rights and freedoms as well as

the principle of universality of human rights and freedoms and gender equality;

Lithuania with reliable collective defence guarantees, however, it does not exempt from the

responsibility to prepare for national defence individually and in co-operation with the allies.

Therefore, in developing military capabilities the Republic of Lithuania will aim at ensuring the

balance between national needs and international commitments. In order to ensure not only

capability maintenance, but also development of capabilities, the Republic of Lithuania will

consistently increase the share of the gross domestic product (GDP) allocated for defence with a

view to reaching the commitment to NATO to allocate 2 per cent of GDP for defence in the

shortest possible terms. The Republic of Lithuania will:

15.5.1. strengthen the combat capabilities of the Armed Forces (especially Land Force),

and develop the active reserve in order to properly prepare them for the armed defence of the


-----

State individually and in co-operation with the allies and for the participation in international

operations;

_the Republic of Lithuania._ Presidency of international organisations, holding of important

positions in institutions of international organisations enables to timely and effectively contribute

raising initiatives relevant to national interests. With a view to gaining a foothold and expanding

its influence in international organisations, the Republic of Lithuania will strengthen negotiation

and lobbying capacities of national institutions and missions abroad, seek a smooth institutional

co-operation.
