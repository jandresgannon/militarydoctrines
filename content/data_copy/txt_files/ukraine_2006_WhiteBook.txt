###### THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE,
 SUPREME COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF
 OF THE ARMED FORCES
 OF UKRAINE

 ON THE 15[th] ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING
 OF THE ARMED FORCES OF UKRAINE

Fifteen years ago a historically important event occurred in Ukraine – the rebirth of
our national army.

In the course of the past fifteen years, our Armed Forces have passed through the
important and difficult process of institutional establishment. But modern realities
continue raising new challenges to Ukraine’s national security. Our citizens want
to have Armed Forces that guarantee their freedom, national independence and the
respect of their neighbours – goals valued by every nation.

It is vitally important that the level of trust of Ukrainians in their Armed Forces
has been and remains very high. I feel that this trust reflects the Nation’s strong
confidence in the sense of responsibility of Ukraine’s service personnel and their
readiness to do their best under difficult circumstances to ensure the State has a
reliable armed shield against any potential threats.

As President, my position is absolutely clear:

I support the course of fundamental reform of Ukraine’s Armed Forces that is
being pursued by the current leadership of the Ministry of Defence and personally by
Minister of Defence Anatoliy Grytsenko.

I am determined that Ukraine’s legislative and executive authorities should pursue
one primary goal only – to form modern Armed Forces that will meet all necessary
European standards in military training, efficiency, equipment and protection.

I call on all responsible political forces of the country to ensure stable conditions
to reform the Armed Forces and refrain from politicizing their problems. Since the
Armed Forces are one of the most important pillars of the State, the Armed Forces
can not be held hostage to political games.

We have managed to achieve many improvements in the development of the
military over the last two years. As the Supreme Commander-in-Chief I am proud
to point out the substantially increased level of combat readiness that we have
acheived. In autumn 2006 I personally observed the skills of soldiers and officers
of all armed services and branches of the Armed Forces of Ukraine – infantrymen
and paratroopers, drivers of combat vehicles and members of tank crews, pilots and
anti-aircraft gunners at the training ground of “Shyroky Lan” in the Mykolaiv region.
I am committed to continuing efforts to increase combat readiness even further.

The Armed Forces are continuing to develop and reform. In spite of many
difficulties, the Ukrainian soldier has proven his high level of professional
skill. This has been confirmed by active and wide-scale participation in
international peacekeeping missions and in large-scale military exercises such as


-----

“Reaction-2005” and “Clear Skies-2006,” as well as in their close cooperation with a
large circle of international partners.

The Armed Forces have become transparent to society. Ukrainians are aware
of the problems of the military and realise, that we are neither satisfied with the
capabilities of former Soviet equipment nor with its limited service life. Society also
realizes that Ukraine must properly respond to the threats and challenges that we face
together with the European and international communities – who themselves face
these same challenges.

Our mission is to create high-quality, multifunctional, mobile, professionally
trained, well-armed and fully equipped Armed Forces. This goal was given a clearly
defined direction with the adoption of the State Programme of Development of the
Armed Forces of Ukraine for 2006-2011.

We should strive to achieve the best international standards and models. This is
one of the main motives for Ukraine’s integration policy towards the European Union
and NATO. We will not leave the path that leads our Nation to membership in these
organizations. I believe that the Ministry of Defence will remain one of the leaders
of our Euro-Atlantic integration policy.

The achievement of concrete results in this integration process will positively
impact the Armed Forces in all areas of development and reform outlined in the State’s
defence policy: raising the level of professional skills and operational readiness;
implementing the acquisition of new equipment; instilling within the Armed Forces a
higher level of discipline and a culture of respect for human life and dignity.

I would also like to address the need today to heighten the national spirit in the
military sphere. We are reviving the reputation of the Ukrainian soldier, the reknown
of Cossacks, colonels, and other officers whose service was full of nobility and
dignity. The time has come for the Armed Forces of Ukraine to feel the need to
revive its Cossack history, to honour Cossack graves, to preserve historical sites – in
Ukraine and abroad – that are sacred to Ukrainian service personnel. Let us follow
the example of other peoples. The Armed Forces of Ukraine have their own history
and ought to honour it.

And, at last, we must speak about a substantial improvement of the welfare of our
military personnel. I categorically reject the notion that the basic needs of service
personnel only represent a burden for the State Budget. If we do not learn to finance
our own army – we will finance a foreign army. This rule is as old as the world.

I want the Nation, Parliament and Government to understand this truth. The state
must truly provide for its defenders. In the context of the development of the 2007
State Budget I will place a special emphasis on the needs of service personnel. They
should be properly addressed.

On this anniversary of the Armed Forces of Ukraine I wish all Ukrainian military
personnel success, enthusiasm, and confidence in the vitality of their own state. With
profound respect I address the veterans whose experience is of great importance to
Ukraine. I also address words of support to those, who are taking their first steps
in military service. The solidity of these steps will define your further professional
growth and military success.

I also congratulate parents whose sons and daughters serve under the banner of the
Armed Forces of Ukraine. Your children have chosen a difficult, but an honourable
profession. I wish you happiness, goodwill, and perseverance.

_President of Ukraine, Supreme Commander-in-Chief_
_of the Armed Forces of Ukraine_

##### OPENING ADDRESS
 OF THE MINISTER
 OF DEFENCE OF UKRAINE

The Ministry of Defence of Ukraine presents this second annual edition on the
life and activities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine – _The White Book 2006, which_
continues our direct dialogue with the Ukrainian public. The book highlights the
main results, achievements and challenges of the first year of implementing the State
Programme of Development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for 2006-2011, which was
described in detail in The _White Book 2005._

Special emphasis has been placed on significantly revising The Strategic Concept
_of Employment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which has enabled the process of_
military reforms to achieve new qualitative results in 2006.

This document sets out scenarios for the use of the Armed Forces based on
real risks and threats to national security in the military sphere. For each scenario
the strength and composition of required forces as well as the required resource
support has been defined. The Strategic Concept has enabled us to not only review
the balance between the Services that comprise the Armed Forces, as well as their
structure, quantity and combat composition, but also has given us the scope to reduce
mobilization requirements, thus saving billions of hryvnas (UAH) for the Nation.

The document has also helped to define specific missions for the Armed Forces in
every scenario of their possible employment. This has helped to focus combat training,
making it more understandable to military personnel, and thus more effective.

Accomplishing their assigned missions requires that modern Armed Forces have
a high level of training and professionalism, along with the skills and experience of
all the Armed Services acting jointly, as well as multi-functionality, mobility and
interoperability. The Armed Forces of Ukraine have focused their efforts in 2006 on
achieving these qualities.

The manning of the Armed Forces with professional service personnel continues.
As of today, contract service personnel constitute 38 per cent of the total enlisted
strength of the Armed Forces. The level of training, unit cohesion and discipline
exhibited by units with contract servicepersonnel proves that the policy decision
towards professional Armed Forces is the right one.

2006 was the year of the Air Force. Our main efforts and resources were
directed at training and equipment. The conduct of the command and staff exercise


-----

“Clear Skies-2006”, which took place with the participation of the President of
Ukraine – the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces – demonstrated a
satisfactory level of readiness of Air Force units to work jointly with the other Armed
Services to fulfil their operational missions.

Ukraine’s participation in international peacekeeping missions has helped our
Armed Forces obtain unique and extremely necessary experience. During 2006 more
than 1,400 Armed Forces’ personnel passed through the “school” of peacekeeping
operations, gaining crucial operational experience in the ranks of multinational
military formations and honourably representing Ukraine in the international system
of regional and global security.

Significant steps have been taken towards equipping the Armed Forces with
modern weapons and equipment. A new corvette “Ternopyl” was added to the
number of combat vessels of the Naval Force. The State Defence Commission
launched the development of a Ukrainian tactical missile system, which will foster
the modernisation of the missile forces within the Land Force and provide the Naval
Force with missile systems.

We have begun a process of relieving the Armed Forces from the burden of noncore functions and tasks. Commanders of military units have been released from
maintaining housing and barracks facilities. The participation of private enterprises
in the provision of food supply to the Armed Forces is being actively introduced.
The first step has been taken towards releasing the Armed Forces from the mainly
administrative functions of management and sale of surplus materiel and lands.

At the same time not all of the missions planned for 2006 have been carried out in
full. Combat training plans, the re-equipment of the Armed Forces with new systems
of weapons and equipment, the provision of housing facilities for the servicepersonnel
were not fully accomplished. The main obstacle to achieving these plans was the
incomplete and untimely financing of the Armed Forces.

The solution of the chronic problem of financing is a main priority of the
Ministry of Defence. Yet, this problem cannot be solved without the support of the
state and society. We can see a major reserve to straighten out all those problems in
strengthening a democratic civil control, openness of the Armed Forces, and fruitful
cooperation with the representatives of civil society.

There is a Public Board at the Ministry of Defence consisting of representatives
of 85 non-governmental organisations. People’s Deputies of Ukraine are invited
to all the meetings of the Ministry of Defence Board. The Ministry of Defence
website highlights information on the life and activities of the Armed Forces on a
day-to-day basis. The Ministry of Defence does not attempt to conceal either its
problems or its shortcomings. All the above-mentioned measures are aimed at
increasing the awareness of all the citizens of Ukraine – parliamentarians, taxpayers
and service personnel in every military unit – as well as our foreign partners on the
activities of the Armed Forces, the flow of budget money and the nature of support
required by the Armed Forces.

I am confident that the positive changes in the development of the Armed Forces
of Ukraine in 2006 have gained an irreversible character. The joint efforts of the
Ministry of Defence, the entire state as well as society to resolve the problems of
the Armed Forces will serve to maintain the level of defence capability that Ukraine
needs.

_Minister of Defence of Ukraine_

###### CHAPTER 1

#### PROGRESS IN 2006 IN IMPLEMENTING
 UKRAINE’S ARMED FORCES’ 
 DEVELOPMENT PLANS

n 2006 the activities of the Armed Forces were directed towards the accomplishment of the missions
### Idefined by The State Programme of Development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for 2006-2011. The
main emphasis was placed on the development of the Air Force as well as raising the battle readiness of
the Joint Rapid Reaction Forces as the premier component of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
The efforts of the Ministry of Defence and the General Staff of the Armed Forces were mainly focused
on the professionalisation of the Armed Forces, the coordination of the employment of troops between
the services and the relieving of the Ministry of Defence and military formations from non-core tasks and
functions.
Practical steps could be taken in these directions, in particular in the strategic planning and organizing
of troop training, thanks to the approval by the President of Ukraine – Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the
Armed Forces – of The Strategic Concept of Employment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine as well as the
elaboration and approval of a number of supplementary documents. The approval of these documents
along with the successful fulfilment of missions defined by the State Programme of Development of the
Armed Forces of Ukraine for 2006-2011 provided the basis for the main achievements during the year.


STRATEGIC CONCEPT
OF EMPLOYMENT
OF THE ARMED
FORCES


In March 2006 the President of Ukraine – Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the
Armed Forces – approved The Strategic Concept of Employment of the Armed Forces
_of Ukraine (hereinafter The Strategic Concept)._

This document, based on an analysis of the entire spectrum of possible military
threats to Ukraine, defined seven scenarios and, accordingly, seven typical situations
of the employment of the Armed Forces, ranging from large-scale employments
(border blocking in case of a conflict or a defensive operation) to those of a much
lesser scale and intensity (participation in a counter-terrorist operation, disaster relief
operations, etc.).

For each possible situation an optimal set of forces
and means needed to accomplish the mission was
defined. The analysis includes the use of active and
reserve components. On the basis of _The Strategic_
_Concept, the Minister of Defence approved_ _The_
_Strategic Plan of Employment of the Armed Forces_
(hereinafter The Strategic Plan), which correlates the
defined missions with the process of the Armed Forces
development and takes into account economic and
mobilization capabilities of the State. _The Strategic_
_Plan_ estimates quantitative parameters of forces
and means necessary to ensure the military security
of the State under modern conditions, taking into
consideration scales and dynamics of modern threats.

According to _The Strategic Plan,_ the Minister of Defence and the Chief of the
General Staff – Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces – personally approved
_combat formations and unit mission statements,_ which will remain in the combat
structure after 2011 (Diagram 1.1). This was the first time in the history of the Armed
Forces of Ukraine that such planning was carried out for each separate brigade.

chapter 1


**Diagram 1.1. The Strategic Concept of Employment of the Armed**
Forces of Ukraine and documents derived from it


With the above-mentioned unit mission statements,
the commanders of combat formations and units, up
to regimental level, received specific direction both
on combat employment and combat training. As a
result, every commander now knows how to train his
subordinated formations (unit or small unit) and react
in a given situation.

At the same time, the parameters specified in the
unit mission statements are the criteria against which
not only the readiness of a formation is tested, but
also the professional ability of commanders, their
suitability to the command and the perspectives of
their career development. Approval of _The Strategic_
_Plan and unit mission statements enabled changes in_
the approaches to the training of troops, in particular
to the planning and conducting of combat training. If
previously combat training was planned and conducted
according to predictable patterns and fictitious
scenarios lacking any sense of reality, planning is now
based on the possible scenarios of employment of the
Armed Forces according to The Strategic Plan. Combat
training is carried out in authentic conditions and has a
joint nature, because modern operations require rapid
response to combat actions, a fast response to changes
in the situation, joint use of forces and expertise of
different armed services and branches of the Armed
Forces simultaneously.

|THE STRATEGIC CONCEPT OF EMPLOYMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES OF UKRAINE FOR 2006-2011 Approved by the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: • real and potential threats to national security of Ukraine in military and other spheres; • scenarios of the employment of the Armed Forces in accordance with real and potential threats; • ways of employing the Armed Forces in defined scenarios; • order of operational planning and command and control of troops according to the defined scenarios of employment; • all State and Ministry of Defence measures to make the Armed Forces ready for employment.|Col2|
|---|---|

In turn, _The Strategic Plan sets up specific_
requirements for the capabilities of combat formations,
units and small units participating in such operations.

**FORMATIONS’ (UNITS)** It requires them to act purposefully and with effect in

complicated contingencies under conditions of highly

_Approved by the Minister of Defence and the Chief_ dynamic and tense combat actions; to accomplish

missions in the best and quickest way, acting as part of
a joint (possibly multi-national) formation; to be able
to defend, evade enemy strikes and inflict defeat. The
major event of the year, the command staff exercise
“Clear Skies-2006”, was carried out taking into
account all the mentioned considerations. Though it
was conducted in the framework of the Year of the Air
Force, units from all three armed services of the Armed
Forces participated in the event. The exercise scenario
was implemented on land, in the air and in the Black Sea area simultaneously. The
troops accomplished their tasks in conditions close to a real combat situation.

The conducting of such exercises along with the participation of Ukrainian units
in joint actions (exercises, training and peacekeeping operations) with partner states
contributes to increasing the combat readiness of the Armed Forces and defence
capability of the State.

**Thus, approval of** **_The Strategic Concept_** **and The Strategic Plan,** **combat**
**formations and units mission statements has set a qualitatively new standard**
**for troop training, given a real impetus to combat training as a true priority for**
**developing the Armed Forces and created effective incentives for improving the**
**work of commanders at different levels.**

|THE STRATEGIC PLAN OF EMPLOYMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES FOR 2006-2011 Approved by the Minister of Defence of Ukraine: • arrangement of mission tasks by troops according to defined scenarios of employment in peacetime, during emergencies and times of crisis; • forms and types of employment of troop formations and their composition, taking into account their subdivision for functional structures; • military administrative and operational strategic division of the territory of Ukraine; • resource requirements (including mobilization) for employment of the Armed Forces and other military formations in times of crisis; • structure of command and control organization of joint formations of troops; • basis of co-ordination with other ministries’ military formations during the conduct of territorial defence missions and joint activities aimed at defence and guarding of the state border.|Col2|

PROGRESS IN 2006 IN IMPLEMENTING UKRAINE’S ARMED FORCES’ DEVELOPMENT PLANS


chapter 1


IMPLEMENTATION
OF THE STATE
PROGRAMME
OF DEVELOPMENT
OF THE ARMED
FORCES


The accomplishment of the missions for 2006, as defined by The State Programme
_of Development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,_ closely reflected the considerations
and requirements of the above mentioned documents and the experience gained
from international military co-operation and participation of Ukrainian military
units in international peacekeeping operations. The implementation of _The State_
_Programme of Development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was in constant focus of_
the Verkhovna Rada, Government and the National Security and Defence Council of
Ukraine headed by the President of Ukraine.
The main efforts of the Ministry of Defence and the General Staff were aimed at
increasing the professionalism of the Armed Forces, ensuring the joint co-ordination
of troop employment and relieving the Ministry of Defence and military formations
from non-core functions and tasks.

These priorities were achieved in the following ways.

Professionalisation of the Armed Forces

  - **upgrading of troop training quality** was achieved by conducting goaloriented, complex and true-to-life activities (training activities, exercises,
weapons firing, air and naval operations) and reflected in high assessments for
combat readiness in units training according to designated missions stipulated
in the formations’ and units’ mission statements;

                     - **improvement of the Armed Forces functional**
**structure was achieved through the completion of the**
manning of the Joint Rapid Reaction Forces (78% of
their units were estimated ready to execute missions
according to their level of manning) as well as the
creation of a normative basis for forming a capable
Reserve of Forces;

                     - **gradual transition of the Armed forces to a**
**contractual principle of manning** is on-going,
taking into account the results and lessons of an
experiment with 3 brigades and the large amphibious
vessel “Kostyantin Olshanskiy”. Despite significant
difficulties, incentives for attracting people to military
service and having service personnel prolong their
contract were implemented; contract service personnel
manning plans were completed to 94%; and, a contract service in the Reserve
was initiated.

  - **increasing the professional level of individual service personnel** is
being accomplished through implementation of service promotion stimulus
depending on the level of individual training and the level of subordinated
formations combat readiness; improvement of conditions to upgrade the level
of professional training (improving the system of education, professional
and language learning, and initiating the system of upgrading officers’
qualifications);

  - **promotion within the Armed Forces of well-qualified specialists and**
**service personnel with peacekeeping mission experience: in 2006 more than**
90% of 180 service personnel who studied abroad were appointed to command
positions ranging from tactical to operational and strategic levels;

  - **introduction of a new system of personnel management,** the principal
element of which are service personnel “job positions” – service record and
evaluation of results of service activities considering level of individual
training and the level of subordinated unit readiness to carry out designated
tasks;

  - **improvement of discipline and law and order:** the number of offences
carried out during military service has decreased 15% compared to 2005;

chapter 1


PROGRESS IN 2006 IN IMPLEMENTING UKRAINE’S ARMED FORCES’ DEVELOPMENT PLANSPROGRESS IN 2006 IN IMPLEMENTING UKRAINE’S ARMED FORCES’ DEVELOPMENT PLANS

                    - **equipping the Armed Forces with modern military weapons and**
**equipment: it was possible to pick up the pace of equipment renewal of the**
Joint Rapid Reaction Forces through weapons and equipment procurement.
New approaches to repairs and modernization of weapons and equipment are
being widely used.

Providing interagency coordination of use of forces

                    - **improve co-operation and co-ordination of the armed services in the**
**General Staff, in particular by introducing the position of First Deputy Chief**
of General Staff and appointing senior officers and generals from different
armed services of the Armed Forces to positions in the General Staff;

                     - **functional and structural upgrade of the system of operational command**
**and control of troops,** through the creation of a command and control element
for joint formations – the Joint Operational Command;

                    - **interoperability of troops during international exercises and fulfilment**
**of missions in the frames of multi-functional formations and multi-**
**national contingents of peacekeeping forces** has been ensured through the
harmonization and circulation of documents, transition to common technical
standards, co-ordination of procedures of troop activities, exercises and
training of commanding staff and troops, including joint exercises;

               - creation and development of multi-functional formations with participation of
different combined units at the level of Brigade, Corps.

Upgrading of command and control system

                    - **finalizing the division of functions between the Ministry of Defence and**
**the General Staff: implementation of structural changes at the Head Office of**
the Ministry of Defence and the General Staff;

                                       - **optimization of the structure of the Ministry**
**of Defence:** redundant structures are being
eliminated, decision-making procedures simplified,
functions and authorities better defined; and,
tighter supervision over goal-oriented spending of
budgeted funds;

                                       - **the division of command and control functions at**
**the operational-strategic level is being introduced**
**in the General Staff:** the creation of territorial
commands is underway; their functions include
organization of territorial defence, mobilization
training and reserve training;

                       - changes in the framework of a three-level
**operational command and control system (the**
**General Staff – Joint Operational Command – combined services**
**formation):** the Army Corps were put under direct command of the
Commander-in-Chief of the Land Force, thus eliminating one level (operational)
of command within the system of operational command and control of the
Armed Forces; functions and tasks of the General Staff structural units have
been clarified, its main departments both structurally and functionally are being
formed according to the HQ organization standards (“J-Structure”) of NATO
member states; optimization of the Armed Forces structure and strength.

Optimisation of the structure and strength of the Armed Forces of Ukraine

                    - **upgrading of the Armed Forces structure** was carried out, taking into
consideration the forces and means needed to accomplish the missions
outlined in The Strategic Plan of the Armed Forces Employment. One brigade,


-----

PROGRESS IN 2006 IN IMPLEMENTING UKRAINE’S ARMED FORCES’ DEVELOPMENT PLANS


chapter 1


3 regiments, 3 testing grounds, 12 separate battalions were downsized. A more
rational balance of combat units and support and supply units was provided.

  - **planned downsizing of strength:** the Armed Forces strength was reduced
by 24,000 authorized positions, including 15,000 service personnel; with an
end-of-year ratio between senior and junior officers of 1.0:1.13, the Armed
Forces are moving towards the “optimal” ratio of 1.0:1.5). The number of
higher officers has been stabilized (authorized strength – 143 officers);
the number of general positions in the Ministry of Defence has reduced to
7 positions from 17 positions in 2005.

Relieving the Ministry of Defence and military formations
from non-core functions and tasks

In 2006 Ministry of Defence took decisive measures directed towards relieving
military command and control elements, combat formations, commanders and service
personnel from non-core tasks and functions. As a result:

             - the Army Corps was relieved from exercising
**missions of those combat formations due to be**
**disbanded by 2011. This was achieved by allotting**
these missions to Operational Commands that are
not exercising command and control over combat
components of troops after they are removed
from the Army Corps structure. As a result, the
Land Force Command and command and control
elements of the Army Corps are able to concentrate
on maintaining battle readiness and combat training
of military units that remain in combat strength.
After completing disbandment tasks (handing over
property, weapons, equipment to storage bases,
and disposal of surplus materiel) the Operational
Commands will be re-formed into Territorial Directorates responsible for the
organization of territorial defence, reserve training and mobilization measures;

  - **release of troops from functions of accounting and storing of surplus and**
**decommissioned materiel by introducing the Centre for Accounting of the**
**Armed Forces Surplus and Decommissioned Materiel directly subordinated**
to the Department of Disposal of Surplus Armaments and Military Euipment.
Troops now account for and store only materiel officially assigned from the
table of organization and equipment. Stocking, storing and preparing movable
surplus materiel (except small arms and ammunition) for decommissioning is
conducted by the above-mentioned Centre;

  - **release of the Ministry of Defence from non-core functions** through the
creation of a State body – **the State Department of Surplus Materiel and**
**Land – responsible for the sale of real estate, real estate systems, functioning**
though unused surplus weapons and equipment, and decommissioned
materiel;

  - **transfer of certain functions** **of support and supply of troops** to other
structures: to free the commanders from maintaining barracks and housing
funds (short and long-term repairs and procurements of utility equipment)
these functions were transferred **to the Main Quartermaster Directorate**
**of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.** In future it is planned to outsource these
functions – to delegate them on a competitive basis to civilian enterprises or
businesses – and in remote regions to organize state enterprises of the Ministry
of Defence. An experiment is being conducted to invite commercial structures
to compete for the provision of food to service personnel. It is envisaged to
extend this practice to other support and supply functions: guarding of military

installations (with exception for artillery equipment and munitions storage
sites), consumer services, and fulfilment of administrative works);

                    - **release of military command and control elements from a part of**
**administrative and financial functions will facilitate the creation of a**
**single automated system of control over administrative processes** in the
Armed Forces initiated in 2006. Introduction of this system will make it
possible to provide a centralized, open and transparent control of personnel,
material streams, infrastructure, technical maintenance; to decrease circulation
of documents, to downsize the number of personnel in combat formations
employed to exercise supply and support functions; and to lessen risks of
abuses related to misappropriation of surplus property and land.

**The above-mentioned measures will help enable military command and**
**control elements, commanders and service personnel to concentrate on the**
**fulfilment of core tasks – maintaining battle readiness and increasing combat**
**training of the Armed Forces. At the same time, these measures will remove**
**many of the preconditions for illegal activities in the defence sphere.**

Thus, by assuming functions of command and control over the processes of
decommissioning, sale and disposal of materiel, the Ministry of Defence will on the
one hand relieve the Armed Forces command and control elements from the burden
of those functions and on the other hand has significantly limited the preconditions
for profitable abuses and corruption.

The Ministry of Defence will continue to carry out planned measures in this
direction, enabling openness and transparency of Armed Forces activity.


FINANCIAL SUPPORT
FOR THE ARMED
FORCES OF UKRAINE


The accomplishment of tasks and missions stipulated in _The State Programme of_
_Development_ _of_ _the Armed Forces has been aggravated by untimely and insufficient_
financing (Annex 1). The State Budget 2006 envisaged allocation of 7.6 billion
hryvnas for the needs of the Armed Forces. In fact, only 6.4 billion hryvnas or 84.3%
of planned finances was received (compared to 102% in 2005)

As a result, we failed to move from an eroding budget to one of development
**of the Armed Forces, in which less than 50% of the total volume of financing is**
allocated to the maintenance of personnel. In 2006, 67% of the received funds were
spent for the maintenance of personnel. Combat training activity was financed to
50% only of planned volume.


**Measures taken in 2006 in the above mentioned areas encompass practically**
**the whole spectrum of missions stipulated in The State Programme of Development**
**_of the Armed Forces._** **Thanks to its implementation, the Armed Forces have**
**gained a new professional quality, while positive changes in their development**
**have taken on an irreversible character.**

**The combat strength of the Armed Forces includes the Land Force – three**
**Army Corps, including 15 fully equipped combat brigades (mechanized, tank,**
**air mobile, artillery); the Air Force – 208 combat aircraft and necessary quantity**
**of long-range and medium-range air defence missile systems, as well as trained**
**crews, small units and units; the Naval Force – 16 combat vessels as well as a**
**fully equipped brigade of naval aviation and a brigade of coastal defence.**

###### CHAPTER 2


#### THE YEAR OF THE AIR FORCE: 
 BUILDING INTEROPERABILITY
 FOR JOINTNESS

he Air Force is a new service within the Armed Forces, established in 2004-2005 through the merging
### Tof the Air Force and the Air Defence Force. It allowed the Armed Forces of Ukraine to transform to the

tri-service structure common to modern armies.

The Minister of Defence declared 2006 the Year of the Air Force. This takes into account the increasing
role of air power and air defence in modern conflicts, on the one hand, and the critical necessity of
enhancing the level of flight personnel training as well as proper maintenance of the aircraft fleet and air
defence equipment of the Armed Forces, on the other.

The main efforts of the Ministry of Defence and the General Staff were focused on training and
equipping the Air Force. At the beginning of the year the Programme of Development of the Air Force for
2006-2011 was adopted. This Programme has become the main document identifying the goals, areas
and measures for its development.

The ability of the Air Force to perform the tasks assigned to it – in working together with Land and
Naval Forces – was successfully tested during the command staff exercise “Clear Skies-2006”.


PERFORMING THEIR
COMBAT MISSION –
THE AIR FORCE


The major mission of the Air Force is to defend the air space of Ukraine.
In peace-time this is performed by air space control missions over the territory of
Ukraine (603,700 square km), and by preventing air space intrusion along the state
border (totalling almost 7, 000 km, including 5,600 km of land and 1,400 km of
sea).

Every day more that 2,200 service personnel and civilian employees of the Air
Force – employing 400 items of weapons and equipment – are summoned to defence
duties. On average, the radar troops detect and track more than 1,000 targets daily.

Thus in 2006 two illegal crossings of the state border were prevented and
28 violations of rules of the use of Ukrainian air space were prevented. Due to the
strengthening of air space control, the percentage of air space violations decreased by
35% in comparison to the previous year, although the intensity of air traffic increased
by 30%.

In the course of the year the Stand-by Forces were regularly inspected by the
Minister of Defence and Chief of the General Staff – Commander-in-Chief of the
Armed Forces of Ukraine – and assessed as having “accomplished the task”. The
degree of combat readiness of the Stand-by Forces, the level of the professionalism
of their commanders, staff and combat and control officers certify that they are
capable of performing their assigned tasks.

Another mission of the Air Force is airlift of troops, weapons and equipment
during exercises, redeployment of units of the Armed Forces and their participation
in international peacekeeping and humanitarian operations. This task is being
accomplished by cargo aircraft of the Air Force and the state enterprise of the Ministry
of Defence of Ukraine “Ukrainian Air Transportation Company”.

THE YEAR O F T H E A I R F O R C E : B U I L D I N G I N T E R O P E R A B I L I T Y F O R J O I N T N E S S

Today they execute airlift, rotation and logistic support of peacekeeping units
of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in nine countries. The Aviation transport has also
airlifted the peacekeeping personnel and cargoes of partner countries such Canada, the
Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, United Kingdom
and USA, and SEEBRIG multinational brigade (Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy,
Macedonia, Romania, and Turkey).


AIR FORCE Eighty per cent (80%) of total expenditure for the training of Joint Rapid Reaction
TRAINING Forces was allocated to the formations and units of the Air Force (compared to 75%
in 2005). The main aim of the training was to meet three criteria: multi-functionality,
mobility and interoperability of forces.

Similar to other armed services, the training of the command and control elements
of Air Force units was executed in accordance with their specific missions, as defined
in _the Strategic Plan of Employment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine; and, in the_
respective brigade (regiment) mission statement.

Training of the air defence Stand-by Forces was based on realistic scenarios:
preventing air space violations and interdiction of renegade aircraft (those used
with the aim of committing an act of terrorism); supporting aircraft in contingency
situations; and, forcing down hijacked aircraft.

The joint training of the Air Force of Ukraine and the Russian Federation in the
practical control of their air defence Stand-by Forces has become more systematic.
Moreover, interoperability has been achieved with the command and control elements
of the Air Defence of the Russian Federation during the detection, tracking and
neutralization of air targets simulating terrorist attacks.

Training activities have taken on a qualitatively
new character due to their complexity, including
the simultaneous employment of all branches of the
Air Force – aviation, anti-aircraft artillery and radar
troops – in close teamwork with units of other armed
services of the Armed Forces.

Operational and combat training has included the
following activities:

                          - aviation units have performed more than 6,000
tasks in combat scenarios (including more than
1,500 air battles and interceptions, 629 firing at
land-based targets, 530 bombings, 21 launches
of air missiles, 454 tasks in aerial surveillance,
454 airborne landings, 740 airlifts, 575 flight shifts
for a total of 10,553 flying hours);

               - five tactical flying missions in a squadron, 14 in a pair and 5 in a flight
organization have been carried out to perform the assigned combat tasks, and
54 pilots have been trained to perform specific tasks in difficult meteorological
conditions;

                - the number of flight crews being trained to defend the air space of the country
and counter-terrorism air operations has almost doubled from 46 in 2005 to
90 in 2006;

                - the units of anti-aircraft artillery and radar troops carried out 50 manoeuvres
involving redeployment, with each operator tracking 70 and 140 real and
simulated targets, respectively;

                 - with the aim of training the military reserve, two 15-day activities in retraining
professionals (140 individuals); one 10-day training exercise (94 individuals
subject to military duty) and eight one-day testing exercises (370 individuals)
were conducted.

Overall, combat training of the Air Force has been implemented to 80%.
Insufficient funding and the increased number of flight crews trained to defend air
space in peace-time have not allowed the Air Force to fully implement the plan. The
plans of flight and combat training of Air Force units that are part of the Joint Rapid
Reaction Forces were implemented to 83%; the average number of flying hours of
the crews is 68 hours 12 minutes (76% of the Figure foreseen in the annual plan).

In light of the results of 2006, the decision was made to implement a required
system of flight personnel training. The required system clearly divides the types
and areas of training between the Kharkiv Air Force University, the Combat Training
Centre and combat aviation units (Diagram 2.1).

COMMAND AND STAFF
EXERCISE “CLEAR
SKIES-2006”


The training of young flight personnel is organized according to the system
outlined above: in each air brigade 3-4 young pilots are selected for individual
training on the combat aircraft.

As a result of improvements in flight training, the organization of military service
and personnel welfare, the negative trend of losing flying personnel to resignation
has slowed. The number of experienced pilots that resigned from the Armed Forces
for diverse reasons decreased four-fold in comparison to 2005.

The concluding event of the Year of the Air Force was the command and staff exercise
“Clear Skies-2006”. The President of Ukraine – Supreme Commander-in-Chief of
the Armed Forces of Ukraine – took part personally in this exercise.

Both in terms of number and scope of practical tasks performed by participating
units, this exercise was the largest the Air Force has had in several years.

The exercise was held on 6 firing ranges throughout the territory of Ukraine and
on a Russian firing range, “Telemba”, where the firing of the long and medium range
anti-aircraft artillery systems, S-200 and S-300, was executed.

Most tasks of the exercise were executed by units of the Air Force and other
armed services of the Armed Forces either for the first time or after a long break
(Diagram 2.2).

COMMAND AND
CONTROL ELEMENTS
OF THE AIR FORCE –
STRUCTURE AND
STRENGTH


In the course of the exercise a total of 129 sorties were flown and
46 training and 96 tactical bombing runs completed. Final year cadet at Kharkiv
Air Force University participated in the exercise for the first time. They fired the
anti-aircraft artillery system “Osa-AKM”.

**The “Clear Skies-2006” exercise attested to the fact that the level of**
**training within the Armed Forces is noticeably higher than in previous years.**
**The exercise was highly estimated by the President of Ukraine, Supreme**
**Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.**

The structural reorganization of the Air Force had the goal of reducing the total
number of command and control levels and increasing the efficiency of command
and control processes.

The reorganization of command and control elements of the Air Force is underway.
The first step of this organization will be the transition from the existing Air Commands
to the Command and Control (C2) and Warning Centre. This will not only help to
eliminate duplications at the command and control levels, but will also contribute to the
increased centralization of the command and control system, the multi-functionality
of the command and control elements, and effectiveness of response to the change of
air conditions. This year saw the definition of the functions and tasks, organization
and work of the C2 and Warning Centre as well as the mechanism of interaction
with the establishment of the Air Operations Centre and Joint Operational Command.
During the command and staff exercise one of the Air Force Commands has in effect
performed control of “C2 and Warning Centre – formation (unit)” level.

The Automated Command and Control System for aviation and air defence units
is being established. The System is to become a component part of a Joint Automated
Command and Control System for the Armed Forces.

The structure of the Air Force is being improved. Two aviation brigades have
been reorganized into tactical aviation and transport aviation brigades. During 2006,
30 military units have been disbanded; the personnel strength has been reduced by
7,500 persons.

The Armed Forces first **mobile military hospital** with the aviation component,
AN-26 “Vita”, was organized in the Military Medical Centre of the Air Force.
The aircraft is certified to comply with ICAO requirements and can be employed to
transport patients to other countries.

The 7[th] Bomber and Reconnaissance Brigade of the Air Force successfully took
part in the experimental manning on a contractual basis and is now fully manned with
contract personnel. **The brigade command focused on selection and placement**
**of contract personnel, provision of proper housing, and the organization of**
**training, which is considered the best in the Armed Forces.**

WEAPONS
AND EQUIPMENT
OF THE AIR FORCE


During 2006, a large number of outdated weapons and equipment was decommissioned
from the combat strength of the Air Force, which presented an opportunity to direct
the released funds to the modernization of various items of aviation and anti-aircraft
artillery weapons and equipment, radio communication equipment, flight maintenance
equipment and the improvement of force training.

The automated systems of collection, processing and transmission of radio
information have been adopted as a component part of the Automated Command
and Control System for aviation and air defence. The service test of the circular
surveillance radar station has also been completed. Prototypes of high-precision
weapons systems, electronic warfare devices and navigation equipment have been
developed for State testing.

The AN-24 and AN-26 aircraft as well as the anti-aircraft artillery systems,
C-300 and “Buk M1”, have been modernized and their service life extended.

The organizational basis and technological means for modernizing Mig-29,
Su-24, Su-25, Su-27, L-39 have been produced. Given sufficient funding, the Defence
Industrial Complex of Ukraine in cooperation with foreign companies is capable of
fully renewing the aircraft fleet of the Armed Forces.


**In summary, the results of the activities being undertaken by the Air Force**
**in 2006 attest to the level of training of their command and control elements**
**and units and their ability to carry out the mission to defend the air space of**
**Ukraine.**

**At the same time, certain measures in training and logistic support**
**of the Air Force could not be undertaken mainly due to insufficient and delayed**
**funding.**

**In order to achieve modern standards of combat training and functioning**
**of the Armed Forces it is necessary to adhere strictly to the funding determined**
**by the State Programme of Development of the Armed Forces – both in terms of**

###### CHAPTER 3

#### FORCE TRAINING

rmed Forces training in 2006 was directed at supporting the readiness of forces to perform the
### Aspecified missions in the defined situations of employment. It took into consideration the current force
strength, organization and staff structure, level of manning, weapons and equipment, and reserves of
material and technical means.
The level of the Armed Forces combat readiness is an index of the efficiency of military command and
control, and a measure of expediency of implementing the defence budget. It is also the main factor of
improvement of Ukraine’s image in the sphere of international security.
Thus the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine and the General Staff concentrated their main efforts on
setting the aims and content of personnel combat training and on taking practical measures for its
intensification and reaching the final results according to the Strategic Concept of the Employment of the
_Armed Forces._
Main efforts and resources were directed to Joint Rapid Reaction Forces (JRRF) training. Measures
were also taken to maintain the level of combat efficiency of the Main Defence Forces units, performing
of missions by the units, securing and practising joint actions with other formations. The Armed Forces
took advantage of the opportunities provided by multinational exercises to raise the level of their combat
efficiency (Annex 2).


INTRODUCTION
OF NEW
APPROACHES
FOR FORCE TRAINING


In 2006 new basic principles of force training were introduced in terms of organization,
content and the criteria of evaluation of formations’ readiness for performing assigned
tasks.

The organization of force training moved to a 11-month training cycle from the
previous two 5-month periods. Moreover, unit readiness was tested not only at the
completion of the academic year but also throughout the training cycle. This made it
possible to give an objective evaluation of the level of personnel readiness and make
necessary and timely amendments to unit training plans.

The content and character of training were
brought into conformity with the missions defined by
the _Strategic Plan of the Employment of the Armed_
_Forces and unit mission statements. This ensured that_
the training measures became relevant to unit function
and clear to service personnel. This in turn raised the
service personnel’s personal interest in the performance
of missions and contributed to the improvement of
their own professional knowledge and skills. Training
measures, chiefly exercises, were joint in nature and
carried out at sea, on land and in the air. They involved
not only combat formations, but also support units,
such as: hospitals, bases, depots, and arsenals.

The evaluation of formations’ readiness to perform missions was based on three
criteria: multi-functionality, mobility **and** **interoperability.**

Unit commanders were given a much greater role in the planning of training,
choice of subjects and forms of learning, evaluation of unit training and correction
of training plans to bring them into conformity with the missions defined in the unit
mission statement.

TRAINING
COMMAND
AND CONTROL
ELEMENTS
AND TROOPS


At the same time, commanders were made more responsible for the result of unit
training, which became the main measure of a commander’s professionalism and
criterion for promotion.

**These approaches yielded positive results that became apparent at the time**
**of exercises and training.**

During 2006 the prevalent form of training of command and control elements at the
operational-strategic level were command staff exercises, training activities (15) and
operational conferences (14). Training of command and control elements of services
typically took the form of command staff exercises with deployment (22) and on
paper (19) with minimal force involvement.

The most large-scale force training and command and control training activity was
the command staff exercise “Clear Skies – 2006” described in the previous chapter.

As for unit training, tactical exercises with JRRF units prevailed: battalion exercise
(1) and company exercises (15). Six company exercises were conducted with units of
the Main Defence Forces. Brigade exercises were not conducted this year.

**Special exercises of support forces on arsenals,**
bases, depots of the Armed Forces included
combined tactical exercises of fire control, which
were conducted for the first time in the history of the
Armed Forces. They included representatives of the
civil defence forces and local administration. Matters
of fire and explosive safety support were considered
and the readiness to respond to such emergencies
tested.

2006 also saw the first ever large-scale tactical
special exercise with practical deployment of a
military mobile hospital of the Military Medical
Centre of the Air Force. It involved ambulance aircraft
and armoured equipment. During the practical phase
the possibilities of use of the medical evacuation
aircraft, АN-26 “Vita”, medical evacuation helicopters
and automobiles were tested. The training framework
included an international research conference on
“Methodological basis of medical support organization
of the Armed Forces”, in which representatives of the
Armed Forces of Ukraine, NATO Nations and Partners
participated.

The readiness of the mobile hospital to perform
missions in contingency situations was tested by
deploying it at a significant distance (860 km)
from its permanent base and requiring its staff to
provide real medical care to participating civilians
(Figure 3.1).

The exercise demonstrated the capability of the mobile hospital to carry out
a wide spectrum of autonomous medical care tasks. Afterwards the decision
was made to transfer responsibility for the hospital to the Ministry of Defence
Department of Health Protection. This will enable its centralized use in the interests
of all the armed services of the Armed Forces and in international peacekeeping
operations.

RESULTS OF FORCE
TRAINING WITH
LIMITED RESOURCES


The conducting of combat training measures similar in other military formations
and legislative norms for them was initiated. The measures directed towards
responding to acts of terrorism as well as of natural and man-made disasters.

**On the whole, the exercises of 2006 demonstrated the heightened level of Joint**
**Rapid Reaction Forces readiness to perform assigned missions. At the same time**
**they provided insights into the necessity of raising consistency, coordination,**
**direction of training, and the wider employment of airmobile forces and army**
**aviation.**

In spite of the improvements in force training, especially within the JRRF, the
execution of programmes and plans for 2006 was not achieved in full. (Annex 3). The
main reason was insufficient funding. According to the results of the year, funding of
combat training measures was provided at about 54 per cent of the planned amount
(table 3.1). Measures of JFRR training were financed on an exceptional basis from
the pool of the State Budget, which made up 137.8 million UAH. The funding of
force training from the Special Funds comprised 119.5 million UAH.

As a result, planned execution levels of JRRF combat training are lower in
some positions than in the previous year. The training within the services of the
Armed Forces was restricted mostly to individual training for enlisted personnel and
commanding officer training in classrooms.

The main problem facing the Ministry of Defence and the General Staff is the
necessity of reducing costs while maintaining as high as possible a level of combat
training (and performing other missions). Thus in 2006 one of the main tasks for
Ministry of Defence and General Staff was searching for resource compensation of
expenses for force training plans in order to maintain their combat capabilities.

First, the specified missions in the Strategic Plan of the Employment of the Armed
_Forces and the brigade (regiment) mission statements were adopted as a starting_
point. Then the experience of the previous years and the transition to 11-month
training cycle were taken into consideration. As a result the planning of the most
**cost-intensive combat training measures – large-scale tactical live firing exercises**
(table 3.2) – were reviewed. It was decided to significantly reduce the number of
these exercises, thus allowing significant savings of state funds, enabling at the same
time to improve field training of formations and units.

Modern training equipment has been introduced, at the same time decreasing
wear of the equipment in the process of training and at the same time improving
training efficiency. Thus the Land Force acquired three module simulators for the
tank crew T-64B.

However, force support through modern simulators remains very low and lags
behind the level of the armed forces of other states. (Figure 3.2).

Ukraine’s scientific, engineering and production potential – when sufficiently
financed – is capable of producing simulation equipment comparable in performance
to the best foreign models. Thus, simulators have been developed or are in the final
stage of development for the crews of armoured personnel carriers BTR-3U, the fire
and tactical training of BMP-1 and BMP-2 crews, the anti-aircraft missile systems
“Tunguska”, “Strila”, and the МiG-29, L-39, Su-24, Su-25, Su-27 aircraft.

Equipment of forces with simulators would provide a higher level of combat
training and at the same time allow savings in terms of financial and material
resources through reduced wear and tear of equipment in the process of its intensive
use during exercises.

The decision was made to optimize firing range systems of the armed services
of the Armed Forces (83 in number). It is planned to gradually reduce their number
and switch to specialized training centres where closed training cycles of units
(up to company size) will be introduced. The establishment of an International
Centre of Peacekeeping and Security is planned at the Yavoriv range facilities
(Figure 3.3).

###### CHAPTER 4

#### IMPROVED COMMAND AND CONTROL
 SYSTEM, STRUCTURE, 
 STRENGTH, AND EQUIPMENT
 OF THE ARMED FORCES

2006 saw the continued process of implementing the modern model of the Armed Forces of Ukraine as
outlined in the State Programme of Development of the Armed Forces.
This process aims to reform the structure and functions of the Armed Forces command and control
(C2) system, formations, units, organizations and institutions, their composition and equipment so that
they meet the requirements of the assigned missions and NATO standards. It also strives to ensure the
permanent combat readiness of troops and the continuity of their combat training process.
The structural improvements of the Armed Forces include balancing structures, increasing centralization
of command and control and enhancing the combat capabilities of troops. Special attention was paid to
the development of the functional structures of the Armed Forces, primarily to the dedicated units of the
Joint Rapid Reaction Forces (JRRF).


IMPROVING
THE COMMAND
AND CONTROL
SYSTEM
OF THE ARMED
FORCES


In 2006, the delineation of authorities between the Ministry of Defence and the
General Staff was nearly completed, structural changes in the Head Office of the
Ministry of Defence and in the General Staff were implemented and the optimization
of forces operational control system continued.

As a result of the delineation of authorities, the Ministry of Defence is
responsible for the state policy in the defence sphere, implements politico-military
and administrative control of the Armed Forces, determines the principles of their
development and directions of progress. The General Staff performs the strategic
planning of the employment of the Armed Forces and other military formations, and
implements defence planning and executes the operational control over the Armed
Forces.

In parallel with the delineation of Ministry of Defence / General Staff
responsibilities, a review of the structural elements of the Head Office of the
Ministry of Defence was undertaken. This review
revealed a number of drawbacks, such as: ineffective
control system, complicated procedures of coordination
between separate subdivisions, duplication of functions
and excessive intermediate command levels.

The following changes were introduced to overcome
these problems:

                  - the Department of Finance was directly subordinated
to the Minister of Defence to improve control over
the spending of goal-oriented budget funds and to
handle changes in funding of the most important
programmes (reduction of volumes, terms violation,
changes in the price formation process, etc.);

  - the Department of Disposal of Weapons and Equipment and the Department of
Utilization of Surplus Weapons and Equipment have been re-formed into the
Department of Utilization and Disposal of Surplus Weapons and Equipment
in order to simplify the decision-making process and reduce the number of
employees;

  - the Department of Exploitation and Repair of Weapons and Equipment has been
disbanded to end duplication in the repair oversight structures and eliminate
intermediate command levels. The task of overseeing repair activities at state
enterprises subordinate to the Ministry of Defence was transferred to the


-----

chapter 4


IMPROVED COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM, STRUCTURE, STRENGTH, AND EQUIPMENT

Department of Economic and Administrative activity; that of organising repair
activity at national enterprises rests with the Department of Procurement and
Development of Weapons and Equipment; and the Support Forces Command of
the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which includes the elements for the exploitation
organization of weapons and equipment, assumes the responsibility for the
function of exploitation;



- a new state body – the State Department of Surplus Funds and Lands – was
established on the basis of the Department of Surplus Funds and Lands in
order to release the Ministry of Defence from non-core functions, and increase
the efficiency of the Armed Forces materiel control[1].


**Figure 4.1. Losses of personnel**
of the Armed Forces


The revised structure of the Head Office of the Ministry of Defence is shown
in Annex 4, Figure 1.

Within the General Staff the following changes were implemented to enhance
joint coordination, better control of coordination of military activities and improve
the command and control of the Armed Forces peacekeeping activities:

  - the additional position of First Deputy Chief of the General Staff was created.
This innovation enables one of the First Deputies to concentrate on the
coordination of armed services activities of the Armed Forces, and the other
to concentrate on the co-operation of structural elements of the General Staff
for the strategic planning of the employment of Armed Forces and defence
planning;

  - the proportional representation of the different services of the Armed Forces
among the leading officials of the General Staff has been guaranteed in order to
improve joint coordination. According to the rotation of leading officials, the
Air Force and the Naval Force general officers are appointed to the positions
of Deputy Chiefs of the General Staff (previously occupied by Land Force
representatives);

  - the solution of all military personnel service problems is concentrated in the Main
Directorate for Personnel; the Main Directorate for Humanitarian Matters and
Welfare Support has been integrated into the Main Directorate of Personnel;

**CAUSES OF DEATH**


The main mission of the new Directorate in coordination with the Main Directorate
of Military Service of Law and Order and unit commanders at all levels is to ensure
the safety requirements of service personnel, the prevention of job-related injury and,
first and foremost, situations that may cause death. In comparison with 2005, the
personnel death-rate has been decreased by nearly 19% (Figure 4.1), due to measures
taken to increase military service safety. Though the Figure is not high, it represents
the saved lives of people.

The revised structure of the General Staff is shown in Figure 2 of Annex 4.


2006 The optimization of the command and control system of troops has led to many

25 positive innovations. These include the creation of a Joint Operational Command,

21

18 16 separation of territorial defence preparation functions and reserve training, control of

some tasks by specially created bodies as well as the military administrative division

0 1 of the territory of Ukraine.

_First, the Joint Operational Command has been conceived and legally defined._
It will assume control of peacekeeping units at the beginning of 2007 and from 2009
will take over all responsibilities for any joint deployment – national or international –
of the Armed Forces.

The status and the structure of the Joint Operational Command have been
defined (Figure 4.2.). The personnel have been selected to form its organizational
core – the Centre of Current Operations. The communications and information
support systems were partially deployed, the command and control of peacekeeping
contingents is being transferred to the Joint Operational Command.

After consultations with specialists of leading nations’ armies as well as
representatives of NATO’s ACT, the functions and the mechanisms of interaction
between the Joint Operational Command and the Service Commands during the
planning and operational phases have been determined.
In 2007, the formation of the Joint Operational Command will continue. Especially,
the intensified professional training of JOC staff, including language training, is
planned.

The formation of the other two Territorial Directorates is envisaged on the basis
of West and South Operational Commands, which have been vested with operational
control along with Land Force Command from 2006 and the strength of which was
reduced by 260 personnel.

_Third, the definition of a military-administrative division of the territory of_
Ukraine has been produced within the framework of strategic planning, for the
purpose of delegating responsibilities and authorities, both military command and
control elements and state power bodies for the execution of state defence missions
on land, at sea and in the air[2]. (Figure 4.4.)

ORGANIZATION
AND FUNCTIONAL
STRUCTURE
OF THE ARMED
FORCES


The general structure of the Armed Forces consists of the General Staff, three armed
services (Land Force, Air Force and Naval Force) and major units, sub-units, military
higher educational institutions, installations and formations that are not subordinated
to the armed services of the Armed Forces. (Figure 1 of Annex 5)

During 2006, an improved ratio between the armed services of the Armed Forces
was achieved. Their structure, strength and combat composition were brought
into line with the quantity of assigned missions. At the end of 2006, the overall
strength of the Armed Forces was 221,000 personnel, including 165,000 service
personnel (Annex 5, Figure 2).

chapter 4


The ratio between combat units and combat support units was also improved,
the proportion of combat units reaching 56% compared to 40% in 2005 (Annex 5,
Figure 3).
The reduction of structural elements and strength of the Armed Forces was carried
out in accordance with goals defined by the State Programme of Development of the
Armed Forces. Overall, 24,000 positions were reduced, in particular from the Land
Force – 8,500 personnel (one brigade, three regiments, 12 separate battalions), from
the Air Force – 7,500 (nearly 30 units) and from the Naval Force – 2,500 personnel.
The changes in the structures of armed services of the Armed Forces were focussed
on the command and control centralization of combat major units, sub-units and the
enhancing of their efficiency:
_In the Land Force_

               - the Army Corps were removed from the authority of the operational commands
and report directly to Land Force Command;

                      - the composition of air-mobile brigades was reviewed with a view to increasing
their combat power, multi-functionality, manoeuvrability and interoperability with
the appropriate military formations of the Armed Forces of partner countries.
_In the Air Force_

               - the Air Operations Centre was established;

               - the transition from the air commands structures to the control and warning
centres commenced;

               - the other elements of the command and control system, including automated
command and control system, were improved;
_In the Naval Force_

               - the Coast Guard Forces Centre was established;

               - the formation of a Sea Operations Centre commenced on the basis of a Joint
Forces Squadron;

                - the structures of military naval bases, naval aviation brigades and coast guard
brigades were improved;

               - On the basis of staff of the Navy, the primary national contact centre for
support to the participants of the NATO-led “Operation Active Endeavour” in
the Mediterranean Sea was created.
The different services of the Armed Forces are equipped with almost every type
of weapon and equipment (in particular, the Land Force is equipped to 100%).
The structure, strength and combat organization of the armed services of the Armed
Forces are shown in Annex 5, Figure 4-6.
During 2006, the Ministry of Defence and the General Staff continued the
development of functional structures of the Armed Forces. Main efforts were directed
at JRRF combat efficiency. In particular, the formation of their land component
with Army Corps was completed. The basis of this component is formed by multifunctional airmobile and mechanized brigades with light weapons (Figure 4.5.)

**Figure 4.5. Structure and combat strength of the Army Corps**

chapter 4


IMPROVED COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM, STRUCTURE, STRENGTH, AND EQUIPMENT

These brigades will – in addition to defence missions – serve as the foundation of
peacekeeping units and also be involved in anti-terrorist operations and relief to
natural and man-made disasters.

In 2007, the Army Aviation units will be subordinated to one of the airmobile
brigades as a means of improving JRRF manoeuvrability and attack capabilities.


EQUIPPING
THE ARMED FORCES


Equipping the Armed Forces with modern weapons and equipment is a necessary
pre-condition for their combat efficiency. For the moment, funding shortages do not
permit the re-armament of the Armed Forces at the pace necessary to compensate
age-related loss and break-down of vehicles and equipment.

In addressing the issue of equipping the Ministry of Defence and the General Staff
applied complex approaches, which deal with all stages of weapons and equipment
life cycle: development and inventory, procurement, modernization, repair and
overhaul-period renewal, withdrawal and decommission (Annex 6).

The re-armament of the JRRF, starting with particular units, has been defined as
a priority direction. The second priority among the remaining forces are those units
which will remain in the structure of the Armed Forces after 2011.

Generally, in 2006, 14 new types of weapons and equipment were procured for
service; this exceeds by one and a half the indices of 2005. About 30 experimental types
of weapons and equipment reached the stage of state testing within the framework
of development of new types of weapons and equipment in 2006. The new types
of weapons and equipment were developed according to international, European as
well as NATO standards, which ensures their compatibility with the armed forces of
partner countries of Ukraine in the sphere of international security.

The procurement of weapons and equipment was performed in marginal groups
within the limits of budget funds. The rates of re-armament of the JRRF have
been exceeded by 4-5 per cent due to the concentration of resources on priority
directions.

The modernization, repair and overhaul-period renewal of weapons and equipment
already available in units is up to 3-5 times cheaper than procurement of new ones.
14 types of weapons and equipment have been modernized during the year, in addition
to 15 pieces of aviation equipment, 59 armoured vehicles, 250 automobiles repaired
for the Armed Forces, as well as three vessels are maintained for the Naval Force.

The level of readiness of missile and artillery systems has been increased by
11 per cent, and 28 per cent, respectively, due to the systematic decommissioning of
outdated weapons and equipment.

During the year more than 6,900 items of weapons and equipment were disposed
of, including 2,600 items of main types of weapons (aircraft, helicopters, tanks,
combat armoured vehicles, field artillery pieces and anti-aircraft artillery guns, as
well as automobile materiel).

**In general, the parameters of the transformation of combat composition,**
**organizational and functional structures of the Armed Forces and their equipment**
**meet all indices, goals and objectives laid down in the State Programme of**
**Development of the Armed Forces.**

**In the future, their improvements will be implemented by means of strength**
**optimization, advancing manpower quality, acquiring new forms and methods**
**of combat operations, equipping new and modernized types of weapons and**
**equipment and increasing the level of force training.**

 PERSONNEL ASPECTS

rom the personnel policy point of view, transition of the Armed Forces to a professional model entails a
### Fwide spectrum of activities: manning units on a contract basis; the creation of a professional sergeants’
corps, the capacity to provide personnel with education and training; implementation of new principles of
officer career management; maintaining service personnel peacekeeping experience, providing higher
military education, including abroad; implementation of reserve military service.

In 2006 the Armed Forces were able to implement activities in all these spheres – in particular using

the opportunities provided by international military cooperation.


MANNING
THE ARMED FORCES
WITH CONTRACT
SERVICE PERSONNEL


From 2010 the Ukrainian Armed Forces has to be totally manned by professionals
serving on the basis of a contract. In order to examine the problems and risks
which might unexpectedly arise during the full transition of the Armed Forces to a
professional basis, an experiment was conducted in 2005-2006 on staffing a military
unit with contract service personnel. The experimental units were the 30[th] detached
mechanized infantry brigade of the Land Force, the 7[th] bombing-reconnaissance
brigade of the Air Force, the 36[th] detached brigade coastal guard and the large landing
ship “Kostiantyn Olshansky” of the Naval Force[1].

Results and lessons learned from the experiment on manning
of designated military units with contract service personnel.

The experiment was not aimed at “mechanically” replacing the conscripts by the
contract service personnel, but at carrying out a practical examination of the 2010
military unit model for every service of the Armed Forces, thus revealing possible
risks and problems in order to avoid them in the future.

The experiment gave an opportunity to identify the
main challenges relating to the transition to a fully
professional army as well as ways of resolving them.
This is what made the experiment so successful.

_Firstly, the experiment clearly demonstrated_
the advantages of a professional contract army: the
experimental units, in comparison with others, have
a higher level of combat capability and almost twice
as good technical state of armament. At the same
time the level of abuse among service personnel
(“didivshchyna”) was reduced by 90%.

_Secondly, the experiment revealed that the legal_
basis regulating the military services needs serious
revision. Taking into account the lessons learned
from the experiment, the following changes were introduced to the Law of Ukraine
“On Military Duty and Military Service” in the course of 2006[2]:


1 Decree of the President of Ukraine “On activities concerning the Ukrainian Armed Forces units’ transition to staffing with service personnel on a contract
basis”, May, 16, 2005.

              - the minimal term of conscript service was reduced from 12 to 6 months as a
necessary condition for transitioning to contract military service;

               - citizens of service age with a college or polytechnic level education now have
the choice between conscription and voluntary contract service;

              - the maximum age for enrolment to contract service was increased from 30 to
40 years.

_Thirdly,_ the experiment showed that three
of the four defined military units (all except the
36[th] detached brigade of coastal guard) were able to
complete the task of being completely with contract
service personnel.

Moreover, whereas at the beginning of the
experiment the units were mainly manned with
individuals living near the unit’s base. Today 52% of the
service personnel on contract in these units come from
other regions of Ukraine. This was due to measures
to improve conditions of service, in particularly the
provision of service apartments, which could not be
resolved to a full extent, however (see Figure 5.1).
This creates the risk of personnel fluctuation, as the
number of married service personnel on contract grew
significantly (from 20% at the beginning to 50% at the
end of the experiment).

The shortage of service apartments was one of
the main reasons for the inability of the 36[th] detached
coastal guard brigade to be fully manned with contract
service personnel, who represented only 52% of its
personnel by the end of 2006[3].

The fourth main outcome of the experiment is
that it revealed problems which could represent
essential threats to the successful transition of the
Armed Forces to a professional force. In addition to
the shortage of service apartments the issue of low
pay persists.

General activities for providing incentives for military
service on a contract basis

In parallel with the experimental manning of unit 2006 also saw the implementation
of activities for providing citizens with incentives to join the military service on
**a contract basis and minimizing the above-mentioned risks.**

                - from 2006 contract service personnel (privates, sergeants and master sergeants),
who renew their contract were given the possibility of studying at the higher
educational institutions of the Ministry of Defence.

3 The brigade is located in Crimea where many young people are employed in tourism or other seasonal employment. Moreover, the shortage of service
apartments has made it difficult to staff the brigade with inhabitants from other Ukrainian regions.

  - the creation of a service apartment inventory continued. On the basis of this,
five barracks were rebuilt including 311 places.

  - a system of obligatory life insurance for service personnel was regulated[4].

As a result of these efforts there is an **increasing trend, compared with the**
**two last years, in the number of individuals signing a service contract with the**
**Ministry of Defence. It allows a more careful selection of candidates for military**
service: the proportion of individuals without skills or clear vision for their future
has decreased.

By the end of 2006 the number of service personnel

in these ranks.

**a contract basis that made it possible to send whole battalion of a Land Force**
brigade to serve in KFOR in Kosovo in 2006, rather than an “ad hoc” “combined”
unit cobbled together from various units. The advantages of this approach were
immediately evident: quickness in adapting to service conditions, understanding of
subordinates’ needs by commanders, and decreased corruption in selecting candidates
for peacekeeping units.

Enhancing professional level of contract service personnel

In order to provide an appropriate level of professional training 3,245 contract service
personnel, including 618 sergeants, took part in training courses in military training
units (centres) in the last year.

Moreover, a pilot project on teaching English to all
service personnel is being carried out in the designated
military units.

Activities were introduced to create a professional
sergeants corps in the Armed Forces. These included
in particular the implementation of multilevel training
(retraining) of sergeants and master sergeants and new
evaluation criteria including professional training
level, professional, moral and psychological personnel
qualities and suitability to positions.

Sergeants Councils were also established to enhance
the roles of junior commanders and stimulate their
ability to solve problems connected with military unit
activity. They are thus involved in making decisions
on staffing and positioning junior commanders.

**The experimental manning of units and activities aimed at making military**
**service attractive to citizens revealed that the main problem of manning units**
**with qualified personnel remains the low competitiveness of military service**
**within the labour market. First and foremost this derives from the low level of**
**pay and absence of appropriate service conditions, in particular the shortage of**
**service apartments.**

**Thus, there are problems on the path to professionalization of the Armed**
**Forces, the solution of which does not depend on the defence establishment alone.**
**In 2007 the experimental manning of units will be continued in the previously**
**designated units and extended to other ones as well.**


SERVICE
IN THE RESERVES


In implementing the State Programme of Development of the Armed Forces
**a fundamentally new form of military duty** was introduced in 2006 – voluntary
service in the military reserve.

In the course of 2006 a number of legislative acts created the legal basis for
service in the reserve, including:

  - the new edition of the Law of Ukraine “On Military Duty and Military Service”,
dated April 4, 2006 defines main issues concerning military service in the
reserve;

  - the Cabinet of Ministers decree #1426 “On the Structure of Military Personnel
Reserve” from October, 18, 2006, which defined the personnel resources for
military reserve and its assigned tasks. The Decree #1644 “On the Order and
Scale of Pay Provision and Incentives of Subjects to Military Service” from
November, 23, 2006, which defined reservists’ pay (See Table 5.1);

**Table 5.1. Pay for reservists on contract, UAH/year**

**Servicemen categories** **Scale of pay provision**

Higher officers 2,000

Senior officers 1,800

Junior officers 1,600

Warrant officers /senior warrant officers 1,400

Junior sergeants, sergeants, senior sergeants, 1,200
master sergeants

Privates 1,000

  - the draft presidential decree “On Confirming Procedures of Ukrainian Citizens
Serving in the Armed Forces of Ukraine Military Reserves” has been drawn
up. It defines the procedures for serving in the reserve.

Implementation of large-scale service in the reserve began with an experimental
stage beginning in July 2006. It allowed the accumulation of practical experience
in planning, organizing and conducting training and monthly studies. Later there will
be a testing of reservist training programmes to identify the most effective forms and
methods of training.

The Minister of Defence designated a list of military management bodies, units
and formations to participate in the experiment. Advertising of the reserve service and
initial candidate selection on a competitive basis were introduced in these military
units and the military recruitment centres.

SHAPING
THE OFFICER
CORPS


The year 2007 envisages the partial reforming of military training units (centres),
warrant officers’ and technicians’ schools, and military colleges to allow for the
training and retraining of reservists. It is foreseen that the term of annual reservists
training in a military unit will include approximately 35 days (two days monthly and
two annual periods of 5-6 days).

In the context of the experiment it is planned to train 1,200 reservists, including
180 officers, for 11 military units.

**Training reservists is to become an integral part of combat training**
**in military units and will provide additional trained resources for the Armed**
**Forces.**

A number of activities aimed at renewing the officer corps took place in 2006
with a view to enhancing its professional training level, improving personnel
resources and officers’ career management mechanisms, introducing openness
and transparency in the promotion process and developing the personnel
reserve.

These activities have helped create the conditions for strengthening positive
changes in Armed Forces professionalisation and overall military reform.

Professional training system

The professionalism and qualification of the officer corps depend on the existing
military education system as well as a possibility of gaining additional knowledge
(including language skills). The level of officers’ skills
will be enhanced by implementing of rotation basis of
the service.

**Military education is provided in Ukraine’s**
military educational institutions, which include
two academies – the National Defence Academy of
Ukraine and Military-Medical Academy of Ukraine,
one military university, four military institutes and
six military faculties within civilian universities. At
the secondary education level there are throughout
Ukraine two military schools, three faculties and
21 departments of military training, 18 departments of
disaster response and military medicine as well as the
Ivan Bohun Kyiv Military Lyceum.

Efforts to enhance cooperation within the network of military training institutions
and improve the content of the military education system focussed on:

  - establishing a branch training institution of the Land Force – Lviv military
institute integrated into the National Lviv Polytechnic University that in 2006
enrolled its first cadets and students (according to the “four years a student,
one year a cadet” model);

  - bringing military education content into conformity with state standards
**of higher education and the requirements of forces;**

  - better using the nation’s scientific and research achievements in order to
improve the level of training of service personnel. In this respect a unified
**Scientific Training Complex is being established on the basis of the National**

               - bringing the amount of personnel training into conformity with actual troops’
requirements. This meant a **reduction in demand for officer training at**
all levels, especially tactical-level officer training in military educational
institutions, where the number of enrolled cadets (868) was down by 332 from
the 2005 figure.

A system of **enhancing** **personnel** **qualifications** (additional training, and
retraining) was introduced, including:

                     - **establishing in higher military educational institutions an officers course**
**training network, in which officers must participate before their promotion.**
At the same time regulations governing the operational-strategic level of
education were amended, opening it up to deputy brigade commanders/
lieutenant colonel (as opposed to the prior minimum rank of colonel). In this
way, higher level education can now be obtained by younger officers.

The programme of enhancing qualification is based on a key principle: prior to
the beginning of training the future post that the individual will be taking up must
be defined. This will enable him/her to learn in a more focused fashion, prepare
for performing future responsibilities during training and – after training – to more
quickly adapt to the new position:

**• the Multi-National Staff Officers Centre at the National Defence**
**Academy of Ukraine intensified its activities** in order to train officers
soon to be detached to international assignments. The training of Ukrainian
officers for work in multinational staffs is also conducted in military
educational institutions of NATO Member States. In 2006, 294 officers
attended courses of the Centre, while 15 attended courses abroad (including
four officers at the operational-strategic level and 11 at the operationaltactical level);

**• Advanced language training is being consistently implemented. In military**
educational institutions there exist 31 groups of full-time intensive learning
of foreign languages. In the course of the training year 815 officers obtained
training, including 135 from designated military units manned by contract
service personnel. 180 service personnel obtained training abroad (97 attended
language courses, 83 specialized ones).

Career management


chapter 5


The efficiency of the personnel management system was enhanced by a
number of measures, including harmonization of job position and qualification
requirements. Furthermore a system of calculating the strength and collecting
personal data on the officer corps was introduced along with the necessary
information and analytical support. This made it possible to decrease the
number of personnel managers and reduce the influence of subjective factors in
personnel decisions.

The draft “Regulations Concerning the Procedures of Military Service”
defines unified rules for enlisting personnel as well as minimum and maximum
terms for staying in a military rank (Figure 1 of Annex 7).

A review of officer positions has been launched
with a view to creating a unified system. Accordingly,
about 780 (40%) positions were cancelled because
of their duplication or illegal existence. A glossary
of existing positions for officers was created in
accordance with NATO nations’ standards. It allowed
the establishment of a more effective computer data
base system.

An automatically updated database provides
complete information about every officer. In
the space of a few minutes it can provide all the
information needed to make a decision concerning
promotion, retirement, and evaluation of personnel
resources.

Standardized descriptions of service personnel positions now contain details
of the position itself and the qualifications needed for candidates to fill
the position (an example of qualification requirements is described in Figure 1 of
Annex 7).

As a result, commanders and personnel bodies now have the ability: to plan
the distribution of personal resources and accurately estimate the scope, content
and duration of service personnel training as well as to increase the objectivity and
efficiency of personnel decision-making. Moreover, any service personnel wishing
to increase their own qualification for a particular position can systematically
improve their own professional level by working towards the requirements listed
in the position.

The appointment of candidates for vacant positions is based on a fair, transparent
and competitive selection process. For this purpose the mechanism of assessing
service personnel performance (assessment mechanism) has been improved
through:

  - revision and further detailing of the criteria of service personnel performance,
including specific criteria of a given position;

  - new criteria of personnel selection based on the comparison of position
requirements and evaluation of the service personnel’s qualification;

  - enhancement of the mechanism of implementing assessments, including the
consideration of recommendation of officers’ council.

Consequently, whereas in the past the main criteria for assignments to new
positions were formal education and service experience, and promotion depended
on the decision of respective commanders, now promotion is linked to the personal
preparation of service personnel, fulfilment of position requirements and the
assessment of previous performance level and ability to accomplish the assigned
task.

chapter 5


ARMED FOR C E S ’ P R O F E S S I O N A L I S AT I O N : P E R S O N N E L A S P E C T S

Signing a contract for at least five years future service is a precondition for
being assigned to a higher position, to study in Ukraine and abroad, as well as for
participation in peacekeeping operations.

This rule, combined with the implemented procedure of candidate selection, will
help ensure that the best prepared and experienced officers with high moral and
professional qualities will continue their service in the Armed Forces after completing
the studies.

These officers will provide the officer corps with
skilled personnel with promising potential. They will
share their gained knowledge and experience with
younger officers within the military units and thus
contribute to the process of improving the combat
readiness of the Armed Forces.

The creation of a qualified officer corps is also
supported by the fact that – after a service personnel
completes a higher military educational establishment –
the Minister of Defence personally makes any
decision concerning his/her retirement during the next
5 years.

The approaches toward junior officers have also
changed. Special attention is being paid to the first
years of their service, as outlined in the Minister of
Defence’s “Methodical Recommendations Concerning the Adaptation of Junior
Officers to Service Activities in the Armed Forces During the First Three Years”.

These measures not only better regulate the procedures of military service,
but will also contribute to the qualitative and structural improvement of officer
staff.

The main results of improvements to the structure of the officer corps include:

               - the stabilization of the number of senior officer staff (there are currently
143 generals) at the level determined by the State Programme of Development
of the Armed Forces;

              - the achievement of a current ratio of senior to junior officers of 47% and
53%, respectively, which should make the 2011 target goal of 40% and 60%,
respectively, attainable without unnecessary social tension;

               - the completion of the transfer of officers to contract military service.

Personnel rotation

The experience of developed countries in organizing military service clearly attests
to the need to rotate officers for the sake of gaining a wide range of practical
experience: command positions in regular troops, staff positions, scientific and
educational activities, etc. Thus the rotation can be carried out not only vertically,
but also horizontally.

These approaches of officer rotation are now being implemented in the Ukrainian
Armed Forces. For example, in the past an assignment to the position of General
Staff officer or to the position of a mechanized brigade commander received an
officer from the same service and from the same structure. Now every officer, who
meets necessary requirements, can be appointed. Main attention is being paid to the
experience and the assessment of an officer’s activities during service in various
positions.

The application of these new approaches can be seen in the following examples
of rotation:

**These measures will enable the creation of a Cadre Corps in the near future asa**
**well as the more effective use of promising professional personnel. Furthermore,**
**this allows the enhancement in the levels of professional service personnel and**
**their combat readiness in the units in which they serve.**

The staffing of the positions in the central office of the Ministry of Defence by civil
servants in particular (civil servants – 79%, service personnel – 21%) is characterized
by the raising of their qualifications not only for the efficient fulfilment of their
duties, but also for the creation of a personnel reserve for promotion within the state
service.

2006 witnessed the goal-oriented enhancement of the professional development of
civil servants within the central office of the Ministry of Defence through professional
programmes and focused courses and seminars.

The education, training and professional development of civil servants was
provided by the Presidential Academy of Public Administration in Kyiv, its four
regional institutes (in Dnipropetrovsk, Lviv, Odessa, Kharkiv), the Ukrainian

National Defence Academy and other institutions of higher education in Ukraine
(Kyiv National Economical University, Odessa National Academy of Law, Ternopyl
Academy of National Economy, etc).

The education and training of civil servants was facilitated by international
assistance. 2006 saw the launching of the Programme for the Professional Development
of Civilian Personnel under the auspices of the NATO-Ukraine Joint Working Group
for Defence Reform. In the framework of the Programme 19 civil servants attended
training courses abroad, while 32 civil servants completed English language training
organized by the British Council.

**The goal-oriented, systematic professional development of civilian personnel**
**of the Ministry of Defence supports the effective strategic management of the**
**Armed Forces, and creating a more competent and efficient reserve for state**
**service promotion.**


**Personnel policy measures implemented in 2006 in the Armed Forces**
**of Ukraine greatly improved the qualifications of officers, contract service**
**personnel, and specialists. Moreover these measures enabled the retaining in the**
**Services of well-educated and trained personnel and improved the level of force**
**training. The process of making the military service more attractive to young**
**people is continuing. The Armed Forces offer them a real chance to obtain a**
**higher education, study a foreign language, and gain unique experiences through**
**participation in peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance missions.**

**The practice of sending integral units for participation in peacekeeping**
**contingents rather than gathering together individuals from disparate military**
**formations has proved its efficiency and will be continued.**

INTERNATIONAL
COOPERATION

PROGRESSING
RELATIONS
WITH NATO


In 2006 the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence cooperated with defence authorities
from 60 countries as well as with 90 non-governmental organizations and regional
agencies. During the year, some 100 meetings were held by the Minister of Defence,
Chief of General Staff and Service Commanders with their counterparts from other
countries. As a result, six inter-governmental and eight inter-agency agreements with
11 countries were signed (two agreements with USA, Belarus, Korea as well as with Algeria,
Denmark, Latvia, Pakistan, Poland, Turkey, Hungary, and France). The transparent
mechanism of using international technical support was introduced and the Statement
On International Cooperation in The Ministry of Defence and The Ukrainian Armed
Forces was approved. This enabled increased efficiency of relations with partners[1].

Implementation of the Ukraine – EU Action Plan as well as the NATO – Ukraine
Target Plan, were among the main priorities concerning international cooperation
undertaken by the Ministry of Defence and by the General Staff of the Ukrainian
Armed Forces.

The Ministry of Defence of Ukraine is implementing the strategy of cooperation
between NATO and Ukraine, which defined by the Law of Ukraine “On the Basics of
the National Security of Ukraine” and detailed in the NATO – Ukraine Action Plan.
In April 2006 the Defence Section was created within the Mission of Ukraine to
NATO. It is enhancing the capabilities of the Ministry of Defence concerning
implementing the Euro-Atlantic integration State policy[2].

Ukrainian cooperation with NATO is built in the framework of the NATOUkraine Action Plan, Annual Target Plans, which define concrete tasks for the
Ministry of Defence. Furthermore, cooperation has been conducted in the framework
of the “Partnership for Peace programme”, where the Planning and Review Process
is defined, as well as the Individual Partnership Programme between Ukraine and
NATO.

The majority of activities, defined by those plans
and programmes were initiated by Ukraine and lie in
the content of the Ukrainian goals and interests.

By the end of 2006 some 121 activities, defined
by the Annual Target Plan were completed. For those
activities the Ministry of Defence was responsible.
Some activities are directed towards participation in
international peacekeeping operations as well as towards
achieving the appropriate level of interoperability
between Ukrainian units and armed forces of NATO
nations:

                           - joining the NATO anti-terrorist Operation in the
Mediterranean Sea, “Active Endeavour”, (UK,
Spain, Italy, Germany, Russia and USA, Turkey,
and France are already participating). The initial
national Contact Point was established. Preparation
of the naval military ships has been completed. The
President of Ukraine signed a Decree concerning
participation of naval military ships in the
Operation;

                              - launching the process of using Ukrainian air transport
capabilities for NATO operations: in October
2006 the Memorandum between The Government
of Ukraine and the Supreme Commander NATO
Forces in Europe was ratified by the Parliament of
Ukraine.

The successful implementation of the Annual Target
Plans brought Ukraine to possibly joining a Membership
Action Plan (MAP). The main purpose of MAP is of
the achievement by the aspirant country democratic
standards accepted by leading NATO nations (rule of
law, proper governance, social guarantees, etc).

From January to March 2006 the draft of Chapter II
(Defence) of the Membership Action Plan was produced.
It defined the concrete goals and tasks needed to be
accomplished in order to bring Ukrainian Armed Forces
to the proper level of readiness for fully-fledged NATO
membership. The materials from those documents were
considered while creating the draft Annual Target Plan
2007.

The third phase of the **Planning and Review**
**Process (PARP) was completed in 2006.** The
main goal for the Armed Forces of Ukraine
was preparation of defined assets and units for
cooperation with forces from NATO nations in
peacekeeping, search-and-rescue and humanitarian
assistance operations [3]. This goal has been achieved.
More than 20 units from Land Force, Air Force,
and Naval Force are defined for Operational
Capabilities Concept (Figure 6.1).


3 Initiative regarding designation of goals belongs to the individual nations participating in the programme; these goals are approved at the Political Military
Steering Committee and under the name “Partnership Goals” become the practical basis for developing partnership between participating nations and NATO.
In addition to Ukraine, 19 other non-NATO nations participate in PARP, including Austria, Belarus, Russia, Turkmenistan, Finland, Switzerland, Sweden, and
others.

Considering Ukraine’s requests for NATO assistance in the field of reforming the Armed
Forces, the tasks for the development of the Defence and Budget Planning procedures were
added to the Partnership Goals. Currently the procedures are being implemented in the
activities of the Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces concerning the budget process
and the development of the defence and budgetary programmes.

Control of PARP goals implementation is carried out by the executive authorities of Ukraine.
A system of coordination between the central bodies of executive authorities, involved in PARP
related activities is being formed.

Regulations have been issued to define particular PARP activities and the related
responsibilities of the Ministry of Defence, the General Staff and the Armed Services
Commands[4]. New control elements have been established in the Combat Training
Departments of the Services of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to address the tasks of
planning and organizing of participation in and supervision of the Partnership Goals
accomplished by PARP military units. A total of 94 Partnership Goals were accepted by
Ukraine in 2006, including 76 Partnership Goals assigned to the Ministry of Defence[5].

According to the annual review, progress was made in the accomplishment of 52 Goals,
mainly related to the issue of Ukraine’s Armed Forces interoperability with units from
NATO nations.

Based on progress analysis regarding accomplishment of the Partnership Goals, the Ministry
of Defence and the General Staff issued the Review of Interoperability in the Framework of
_the Planning and Review Process which was passed to NATO International Secretariat. The_
document also defines the tasks for 2007.

In order to implement the Individual Partnership Programme between Ukraine
and NATO more than 230 events were conducted, including 48 in the fields of military
education and training; 27 in standardization and 24 in language training. Five military
exercises sponsored by NATO were conducted, with almost 2,500 Ukrainian service
personnel.

In general, some 16 international exercises were conducted with support from NATO,
with the participation of about 7,500 personnel, representing one-third of the total number of
service personnel participating in all military exercises in 2006 (for large-scale exercises see
Figure 6.2).

COOPERATION
WITH THE EUROPEAN
UNION


**Perspective directions of cooperation of Ukraine with the Alliance were discussed at the**
level of the Ministers of Defence, attended by NATO Secretary General (June, Brussels; October,
Sintra, Portugal). Following consultations in Sintra, arrangements have been made to increase
the information campaign to the Ukrainian public concerning the Alliance’s activities.

**Bilateral relations of Ukraine with NATO countries in** 2006 represented 72% of the
total number of events of bilateral cooperation of the Ministry of Defence and the General
Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

In particular, cooperation with the United States, which is important for the Armed Forces
of Ukraine, was dynamically developing. The American side increased the number of places in
its military educational institutions assigned for the Ukrainian service personnel on a no-cost
basis. The agreement about that was reached at a meeting between the Ministers of Defence of
Ukraine and the US at a session of the Council of Ministers of Defence of South-East Europe
in September 2006.

In the framework of technical assistance during 2006 seven contracts were signed, that
allowed receiving multi-functional communication systems for the units included in the list of
Common Fund of Operational Capabilities Concept, the equipment for the Computer Simulation
Centre of the National Defence Academy of Ukraine, an automated computer simulation system
for conducting tactical exercises for the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

**Accomplishing the tasks of the Ukraine – NATO Action Plan 2006, and**
**achieving Partnership Goals in the framework of the Planning and Review**
**Process are important steps in pursuing military policy in the context of**
**Ukraine’s Euro-Atlantic integration.**

Priority directions of cooperation with EU military bodies in the sphere of European
Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) lay within enlarging Ukrainian participation
in EU-led peacekeeping operations, providing air transport capabilities by Ukraine,
and the participation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in educational programmes and military
exercises.

The issue of participation of a Ukrainian Military
Police unit in the Multi-National Military Police Battalion
(MNMPBAT) has been discussed. Currently MNMPBAT
consists of Military Police units from Bulgaria, Poland,
Slovakia, Hungary, and the Czech Republic.

In the framework of the Ukraine – EU Action Plan,
arrangements are being discussed to use Ukrainian air
transport capabilities by Sweden for the requirements
of the Sweden-led Scandinavian Battle Group
(battalion), formed in the EU Rapid Reaction Force
and comprising units from Estonia, Norway, Finland
and Sweden.

In the military technical sphere, the State enterprise
“Ukrainian Aviation Transportation Company” of the Ministry
of Defence and a delegation of the EU Military Headquarters
signed a Letter of Intent to use airlift capabilities (April 2006).

In the format of bilateral cooperation with EU members, an international project of the
Plan of Environmental Control in the “Divichki” military training area has been completed
(with Danish assistance). There is also a book “The Trends of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’
activities directed towards environmental protection” (with financial support from the Swedish
Government).

**Cooperation with EU military structures and the implementation of the Ukraine –**
**EU Action Plan are directed to supporting State policy in the sphere of European**
**integration and involving Ukraine in the issues of European Security and Defence Policy.**
**All these activities are within the framework of Ukrainian interests.**

REGIONAL
COOPERATION


The activities of the Ministry of Defence in the framework of regional structures is
directed to supporting regional security, enhanced mutual trust between states, as
well as enhancing cooperation between them in the military sphere.

In 2006, Ukraine gained fully-fledged membership in the South-Eastern Europe
**Defence Ministerial (SEDM). Agreements have been reached concerning the**
positions to be assigned to Ukrainian officers in the South-East Europe Multinational
Peacekeeping Brigade (SEEBRIG) Headquarters.

From February to August 2006 the Ministry of Defence Company “Ukrainian Air
Transportation Company conducted air transportation for nearly 400 troops and
450 tonnes of cargo for units participating in the NATO-led ISAF mission.

Ukraine has also stated its intention to join other SEDM initiatives, particularly
concerning: weapon production, defence industry, research and technology, military
education, military support of non-proliferation of WMD, the security of state borders and
the fight against terrorism, and installation of a satellite based communication network
between military hospitals of the armed forces of the participating states.

Cooperation with the Black and Caspian Sea countries has become more active within
the framework of “The Organization for Democracy and Economic Development –
**GUAM”.** A joint peacekeeping unit of GUAM is being formed, capable to participate
in peacekeeping UN-led or OSCE-led operations. In October 2006, during a meeting of
deputy chiefs of general staffs of GUAM states, the Provisions of the GUAM Consultative
Group and the Provisions of the GUAM Peacekeeping Unit were agreed. The structure and
tasks of the unit were defined. The completion of its formation is scheduled for 2007.

Relations aimed at maintaining regional security
in the Black Sea area in the framework of the Joint
Black Sea Group of Naval Military Cooperation
(BLACKSEAFOR) (additional to Ukraine: – **Bulgaria,**
**Georgia, Russia, Romania, and** **Turkey). The member**
states have supported the initiative of Turkey to conduct
the combined operation “Black Sea Harmony”, aimed
at strengthening of security in the Black Sea region and
defining unified methods of combating illegal activities
and threat of terrorism at sea. A protocol of the exchange
of information in the framework of this operation
was agreed between the Ministry of Defence of
Ukraine and the General Staff of the Armed Forces
of Turkey.

Cooperation with the **“Vyshegrad Four” (Poland,**
Slovakia, Hungary, and Czech Republic) is progressing. During political consultations of
Ministers of Defence of The Four and Ukraine held in January 2006 common approaches
were elaborated with regard to the assistance of reforming the Ukrainian defence sector and

Representatives of the Ministry of Defence and the General Staff of the Armed Forces
of Ukraine in 2005 and 2006 participated in various seminars and workshops in the same
structures in Poland and the Czech Republic. This has helped the Ukrainian military
personnel to gain the experience of European and Euro-Atlantic integration from these
East European states.

COOPERATION
WITH CIS
COUNTRIES


Cooperation with CIS countries is carried out mainly in a bilateral format and lay within
the military technical field. The Ministry of Defence of Ukraine is participating in the
sessions of the Council of Ministers of Defence of CIS member states as an observer.
Meetings of the Minister of Defence of Ukraine with the heads of defence agencies
from the Russian Federation, Belarus and Azerbaijan took place in the framework of
such sessions[6].

Cooperation with the **Russian Federation is important for Ukraine as well.** Nearly
50 bilateral agreements were adopted between the defence agencies of the two countries.

One of the main events of the year concerning bilateral cooperation was the
first session of a Sub-Committee for the Security Issues of the Ukrainian-Russian
Inter-State Commission. It took place in December during the official visit to
Kyiv of the Vice Prime-Minister (Minister of Defence of Russian Federation),
Ivanov.

A particular result of the session was defining the main
directions of the Sub-Committee, including: enhancing
cooperation between services and branches of the armed
forces, extending of weapons and military equipment
interoperability, as well as cooperation in the areas of
munitions and rocket fuel components disposal.

The Cooperation Plan was signed between the defence
agencies of the two countries for the period to 2007.
The _Inter-state Agreement About Mutual Protection of_
_Intellectual Copyrights that are Used and Obtained in the_
_Process of Bilateral Military Cooperation_ was prepared
and adopted.

At a Joint press-conference following the completion
of the Sub-Committee work, S. Ivanov stated that Russia
is ready to help the Naval Force of the Armed Forces of
Ukraine to join NATO operation “Active Endeavour”. At the same time, Ukraine would
provide language training courses in Sevastopol Naval Force Institute for the Russian
Black Sea Fleet officers assigned to participate in that operation.

More than 40 joint arrangements were accomplished during the year 2006 within
the format of bilateral cooperation. A combat exercise of Anti-Aircraft Missile Troops
of Ukraine is scheduled for 2007, to be held in Ashuluk in the Russian Federation.

Cooperation between the defence agencies of Ukraine and Belarus is conducted on the
basis of 18 bilateral acts. In particular, an Annex to the Protocol was signed on Cooperation
in the Exchange of Unclassified Digital Maps. About 20 arrangements were completed in
2006, including some in joint training of military personnel for participation in peacekeeping
operations as well as in the field of military technical cooperation. The Ukrainian side has
successfully accomplished the contract for the repair and modernization of ten L-39 aircraft
assigned for Belarus with some ground based equipment. Signing of a further contract to
modernize 20 similar aircraft is planned.

More than 30 arrangements are planned for 2007 on the bilateral basis.

Work is progressing in cooperation with Azerbaijan for the creation of an Inter-National
Centre for training of pilots and specialists in anti-terrorist aviation operations. The centre
is located in Azerbaijan (Sitalchay airbase) and is being organized in accordance with an
inter-state agreement “On the training of aviation pilots, engineer and technical staff” of both
countries. The manning issues were discussed as well.

The enlargement of the area of operations of 56[th] Separate Helicopter Group organic to UN
mission in Liberia and to the territory of Sierra-Leone (following UN request) was evidence of
the fact that Ukrainian personnel accomplished their missions at an appropriate level[7].

Given the significance of theArmed Forces of Ukraine’s
participating in peacekeeping activity, in particular
accumulating and sharing of military operational experience,
enhancing combat preparedness and professional expertise
of the units, the Ministry of Defence initiated the developing
and implementating of legislation acts that regulate the
issues of participation of Ukrainian Armed Forces in
international peacekeeping activities. In particular it is a
Cabinet of Ministers Decree “On Some Issues Regarding
Peacekeeping Contingents and Peacekeeping Personnel
Financed from the State Budget” (dated 30 March 2006)
and the “Instruction for Organization of Peacekeeping
Contingents and Personnel Participation in International
Peacekeeping Operations” introduced by the Decree of the
Minister of Defence in May 2006.

**Participation of Ukraine in peacekeeping missions is a significant factor enhancing**
**its image in the World, promoting effective development of the Armed Forces of**
**Ukraine and their combat capabilities, providing military command and control**
**bodies and military personnel with an opportunity to master their practical skills and**
**achieve interoperability with units from other states, to ensure and maintain peace and**
**stability.**

ARMS Ukraine is a participant to all the principal international agreements in the field of
CONTROL arms control. In the framework of implementation of the Treaty on Conventional Armed
**Forces in Europe, planned inspections were conducted in 2006 to military units (inspection**
sites) in Bulgaria, UK, Greece, Germany, Poland, USA. (on the territory of Germany),
Turkey and Hungary[8]. At the same time Armed Forces of Ukraine units were visited by five
foreign inspection groups (from UK, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary and France). The total
number of inspections conducted by Ukraine on the territory of member states from the
beginning of the Treaty reached 382 and the number of inspection visits received by
Ukraine was 573.

Starting from the beginning of October 2006, Ukraine voluntarily reduced the
maximum authorized strength of its Armed Forces personnel on active duty (from
450,000 to 250,000) and the maximum authorized numbers of arms systems, as
follows:

                       - tanks – from 4,080 to 3,200;

                        - artillery systems of a calibre more than 100 mm — from 4,040 to 3,600;

                       - attack helicopters – from 330 to 250.

In the framework of implementation of the Vienna Document 1999, bilateral
inter-governmental agreements with neighbouring states and in accordance with the
Plan of Verification activity, 16 verification events were conducted in the territories of

7 The Law of Ukraine “On approval of the Presidential decision regarding participation of the Ukrainian contingent in the process of support of activities of the

the Treaty (1999) set quantitative ceilings on armaments (by categories) for countries in the zone from the Atlantic to the Urals, as well as mechanisms
for enforcement of these limitations and providing for transparency, including control activities (verification visits and inspections). In the course of an
inspection, verification includes the correctness of reporting on the numbers of weapons and equipment on controlled objects.

visit to the United Kingdom[9].

Representatives from the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine participated in aircraft
and land units demonstration in Belarus, Germany, and Switzerland. Slovakian
representatives held the verification event in Ukrainian territory.

To implement the provisions of the Open Skies Treaty 13 events over Ukrainian
territory and 13 abroad were conducted during 2006. Five observation flights over
the territory of the Treaty member countries: Greece, Italy, Poland, Romania, and
Hungary were performed[10].

According to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty the following was taken out
of service in 2006: one Tu-22M3; two aircraft Tu-134UBL; 12 air cruise missiles
X-22; five air engines, and two complex training systems. In total, in the framework
of the Contract some 52 aircrafts Tu-22; 423 air cruise missiles X-22; 6 aircrafts
Tu-142, 2 aircrafts Tu-134 UBL, 505 air engines, and two complex training systems
were taken out of service.

A Ukrainian delegation with a group of Russian Federation observers participated
in the demonstration of the new strategic long-range air cruise missile, AGM-158B
in USA (airbase Dice, Texas)[11].


**Supporting and implementing international treaties on armament control**
**improved the Ukraine’s image internationally.**

**During 2006 the Ministry of Defence conducted activities directed to**
**achieving the main goal – to increase combat readiness of the Armed Forces.**
**An immense influence on this was the participation of the Armed Forces in**
**international peacekeeping missions.**


9 The Vienna Document (1999) concerns activities directed at enhancing trust and security.
10 The agreement addresses the possibility of conducting observer flights, aimed at verifing the reduction of conventional weapons. The territory covered
extends from Vancouver (Canada) to Vladivostok (Russia).
11 This regards an agreement signed by the USSR and the USA in 1991 about reduction of strategic offensive weapons. Ukraine confirmed its support of the
agreement in 1992.

###### CHAPTER 7

#### SOCIAL GUARANTEES 
 AS A PRECONDITION  FOR PROFESSIONALISATION 
 OF THE ARMED FORCES OF UKRAINE


HOUSING


ne of the necessary preconditions to reform successfully towards professional armed forces is
### Osupport of the military profession competitiveness in the labour market of payments, social benefits

or guarantees, relating to military service.
The legislative basis of Ukraine provides a number of social guarantees for service personnel and
their family members, such as providing accommodation, financial support, medical assistance, clothing
and catering.
However the legislative basis has not been fully implemented. There is a practice of stopping
implementation of some legal acts relating to social benefits of service personnel. Generally in comparison
with other Ukrainian military formations, service personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have less social
protection.
The Ministry of Defence and the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are doing their utmost
to provide social guarantees for service personnel in order to raise the attractiveness of military service.
However that is definitely not enough to solve this problem. To solve it we need the common efforts of
legislature and executive authorities to understand that it is unwise to save money by paying less to
military personnel.

In spite of the level of new house-building, the issue of housing in the Armed Forces
of Ukraine is painful.

There are nearly 65,000 current and former military personnel waiting for
accommodation, which must be provided by the Ministry of Defence – 32,000 of
them are waiting more than 10 years.

**UAH 1,271.8 Million**

Special fund General fund

72.4% (UAH 921.1 Million) 27.6% (UAH 350.7 Million)


This situation is due to three reasons. Firstly,
because of limited financing for the housing
programme of the Ministry of Defence. Secondly
because of financing from the Special Fund. Thirdly,
because of irregular funding from the main budget
that is impossible to utilize funds received at the
year-end.

On the other hand, the Ministry of Defence cannot
use funding such as privileged crediting, housing
certificates, stocks, etc, because it is not permitted
under Regulations[1]. Building projects are also affected
by rising expenses of construction work (10% during
2006).

In 2006 housing construction was provided UAH
1,271.8 Million, 72.4% of which (UAH 921.1 Million)
was from the Special Fund. Less than half of the
planning requirement (UAH 623.6 Million) was
received in total, and UAH 107.4 Million (17.2%) in
December 2006 (Figure 7.1).

Financial shortfall in 2006 made impossible to complete 16 buildings comprising
475 apartments, planned by the Ministry of Defence.

At the same time, due to resource concentration additional receipts from
common housing system, the Ministry of Defence in 2006 succeeded to receive
4,545 apartments, 4,515 were planned (Figure 7.2). In order to provide transparency
of housing delivery some heads of officers’ council were involved to solve such
problems.

For 2007 the arrangement of financing of housing construction has been
changed. The main financial recourses are concentrated in the Ministry of Building,
Architecture and Housing – UAH 368.8 Million from the State Budget General
Fund. The Ministry of Defence expects to receive only UAH 240.4 Million to build
1,370 apartments from the Special Fund.

However, according to the outcome of the Parliamentary hearings “Concerning
the housing support situation and other social protection guarantees for service
personnel” (12 December 2006) the Parliament of Ukraine approved a Decree, that
envisages keeping previous housing financing system to enhance attracting other
financial sources.

The Ministry of Defence is striving to increase the amount of accommodation
through tenders on a competitive basis for investment projects to build on land
released during reforming the Armed Forces of Ukraine. There are some beneficial
projects being considered by the Ministry of Defence with international companies
_Venture Capital Fund (US), corporation_ _Transstroy (Russia), companies_ _Pacific_
_New Technologies Co (Canada) and Midwest_ _New Technologies Incorporated (US)._
Negotiations are on-going with international trust funds concerning the allocation of
grants to build accommodation for service personnel.

**In spite of partial and irregular financing, the adverse economic situation**
**in the real estate market, the Ministry of Defence has been accomplishing its**
**housing provision for the last two years. However considering the number**
**waiting for accommodation, solving the housing problem is moving extremely**

SALARIES
AND PENSIONS


Payment to service personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is monthly and after
release from military service – payment support is either 25% or 50% of monthly
salary for each complete year in service in accordance with the law (except for
conscripts).

The level of payment for pensioners depends on the regular Armed Forces salary.
So regular monthly salary is on one hand the day-by-day support and “the investment
for the future” on the other. This creates two main problems.

_First – an insufficient level of salary, which is the lowest among the State_
military formations as well as disproportion between the different categories of
employee.

For example, the salary of a senior officer (with 20 years’ service) is
UAH 2,087; whereas, an equivalent officer in the State Border Guard, is UAH 2,836.
A military pilot (Captain) of Ukraine Air Force receives UAH 1,338; whereas, a
Border Control Point Commander of State Border Guard receives UAH 1,508 per
month. The pay of service personnel, such as a Chief of Section, Ministry of Defence
is UAH 2,279 per month, while a civilian employee in other structures in the same
position receives UAH 3,023 per month. Position pay-grades are also different,
for example, a Brigade Commander has UAH 200, and a driver of Taxes
Inspectorate – UAH 380.

_Second – is the distorted payment_ structure, which
derives from additional cash payments instead of
raising the rate of payment for positions and rank. So,
65% of monthly pay consists of additional benefits or
awards. At the same time Position Pay has not been
re-considered since 2000, and Rank payment has not
been re-considered since 1999.

Not all additional payments are considered when the
level of pension is being re-considered. Disproportion
between pensions for service personnel who retired
at different times has reached huge amounts by 1[st] of
January 2005.

This problem was solved by changing the Law
of Ukraine relating to pension support for service
personnel, accordingly from 1 January 2005 all
previous pensions were reassessed. From 1st January
2006 disproportions in pensions were almost eliminated. During 2006 there were no
problems with pension support.

Unless the payments system is re-considered at the State level, problems will
exist. The following are the main problems: great disproportion between official
salaries and different kinds of additional payments; different ways of creating
cash security structure for service personnel and pay of employees; and absence
of salary standards of payments for service personnel of different military
formations.

In 2005, to implement the instructions of the President of Ukraine, a joint
working group of Labour and Social Policy Ministry, Ministry of Defence and
representatives of other military formations prepared drafts of legal acts, where
a rise of official salary and rank pay were foreseen as well as termination of
ineffective system of additional pay and elimination of pay discrepancies for
service personnel of security agencies. At the same time those drafts are still
under the discussion.

**Salary of the personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is not sufficient**
**concerning their social role. The level of payment is not able to provide**
**appropriate living conditions for the families of the personnel and is the lowest**

**above mentioned decreases the level of motivation for the service, has a negative**
**impact on the level of combat readiness, and decreases the level of competitiveness**
**in the current labour market.**


MEDICAL The main goal of the development of the medical system is to provide a high quality
SUPPORT of medical service to all entitled personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

There are nearly 1.1 million personnel entitled to medical support from the Armed
Forces of Ukraine. From 7,000 to 8,000 personnel receive medical treatment on a daily
basis, including from 4,000 to 5,000 service personnel. The social characteristics of
patients who were treated during 2006 is presented in Figure 7.3.

The Programme of development of the medical
support system in the Armed Forces of Ukraine for
2006-2011 was created in 2006, directed to create a
centralized military medical institutions network that
is able to provide medical care and support to military
personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine during
peace time and war. Centralization is achieved by
subordination of medical institutions to the Department
of Health Care of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine,
providing a common policy of health care in the Armed
Forces of Ukraine.

Development of the medical support system is ongoing in accordance with each phase of the overall
reform and development of the Armed Forces of
Ukraine.

There are 23 military hospitals within the Ministry
of Defence of Ukraine, one military medical centre of
the Air Force of Ukraine (Vinnytsa), two branches of
the military hospitals, one clinical base of the military
medical academy, four military field hospitals, eight
sanatoriums and one sanatorium section, and seven
polyclinics.

Military sanatoriums will be changed into medical rehabilitation centres in order
to further develop rehabilitation treatment and sanitary activities. For example,
the Sanatorium Treatment Centre of the Air Force of Ukraine (Sudak) will be
transferred to the Medical Rehabilitation and Special Training Centre for Air Force
and Naval Force personnel, where there will not only be medical services, but
specific training for pilots of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and for personnel from
Navy units.

The medical rehabilitation for peacekeepers of Armed Forces programmes for
2004-2008 foresees creation of a Training Medical Service Centre of the Armed
Forces, where medical personnel, who will take part in peacekeeping operations will
be trained in accordance with UN standards.

Such actions will enable improvements to service personnel’s professional health
care system according to the specific character of their actions. Furthermore, it will
improve the skills of the medical personnel of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

The mobile hospitals network system has been created in order to provide medical
and rescue capabilities. The hospitals will be well equipped and will be ready to
provide quick medical treatment for casualties from terrorist acts and from natural

or man-made disasters. Such hospitals can also provide assistance to the civilian
population.

Implementation of the programme of development of the medical support system
of the Armed Forces of Ukraine will deliver a new level of medical service, achieving
readiness to provide operational medical aid, provide treatment for Ukrainian
peacekeeping contingents, and provide great support to the constitutional right of
service personnel’s health.

CLOTHING **Clothing support of the personnel has been provided in accordance with existing**
AND MEALS legislative basis. At the same time, during previous years clothing support was
financed at the level of 25-30% from minimum necessity. Service uniform support
was at the level of 17-22%, field uniform (80%) and summer field uniform
(88%).

Because of insufficient financing, officers, non-commissioned officers and
contract service personnel were provided only with field uniforms. 65% of minimum
needs are provided with the main uniform. Only from 5 to 8% of servicewomen are
provided with daily uniform, and 63 per cent with field uniform.

In addition, in 2000 the provision of the Second Part, Article 9 of Ukrainian
Law “According to social and legal protection for service personnel and members of
their families”, was stopped, which provided cash compensation instead of clothing
support[2]. As a result, state debt for service personnel for uncollected clothing support
is UAH 367.5 Million, including those who have retired – UAH 85.5 Million.

Also there is a delay to food rations provided or the appropriated cash
compensation. This problem has been partly resolved: in July 2006 the Cabinet of
Ministers of Ukraine approved the decision to provide food supplies to officers, noncommissioned officers, contract service personnel, when on duty. Contract service
personnel are allowed to eat during field training, combat exercises and when
accommodated in training centres and camps.

Activities directed to the development of clothing and catering support have been
undertaken in order to create normal conditions for military service. Implemented
and planned legal changes in case of its resource support will allow improvements in
military service conditions as well as the social prestige of military service.

2 The practice of service personnel receiving money instead of clothing maintenance was stopped by the Law of Ukraine “On some measures for increasing
budget efficiency,” dated 17 February 2000.

#### CONCLUSIONS

**2006 was the first year of implementation of the State Programme of Development of the Armed Forces of**
**Ukraine. Furthermore, it was a crucial year for creating the conditions for transformation of the Armed**
**Forces.**

As a result of work this year, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are ready to accomplish their assigned missions
and tasks. The necessary foundation was laid for further qualitative improvement in combat training, equipment
modernisation, and stable provision of the necessary conditions for military service.

Future efforts by the Ministry of Defence and General Staff will concentrate on the following areas: further
planned reform of forces, with special attention to ensuring continued operational capabilities at each stage of the
reform; strengthening of good order and military discipline; improving mechanisms for civil democratic control;
and increasing safety of operations, both for the Armed Forces themselves and for the civilian population and the
environment.

2007 is designated as the year for improving operational logistics and materiel support, as well as a year for
improving safety for forces and fire security of bases and storage facilities.

**The priorities for Ukrainian Armed Forces development for 2007 are the following:**

  - **practical implementation of the principles of Armed Forces’ reform set out in the State Programme for**
Development of the Armed Forces: **multi-functionality, mobility,** and interoperability. Each service
personnel will train to perform various functions according to the scenarios defined by the Strategic
Concept for Employment of the Ukrainian Armed Forces;

  - **increasing the intensity and quality of combat training: ensuring jointness in military exercises; wide**
introduction of lessons learned in international exercises and peacekeeping missions into force training;

   - **increasing mobility of the Joint Rapid Reaction Forces: introduction of more effective ways of interaction**
between airmobile units and Army Aviation units;

   - **transition to the new stage of the Armed Forces’ manning with contracted personnel: concentrating efforts**
on candidates` qualitative selection; creation of professional non-commissioned officers corps and reservists
corps;

   - **improving the command and control system of the Armed Forces: completing the next stage of developing**
the Joint Operational Command and transferring to it the responsibilities for leading joint force groups and
peacekeeping contingents;

   - **ensuring readiness of Armed Forces units to participate in international peacekeeping missions:**
formation of peacekeeping contingents on the base of multi-functional air-mobile brigades; increasing the
participation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in multinational military exercises;

   - **strict adherence to the legality of financial and economic activities, ensuring goal-oriented, effective and efficient**
financial expenditures and the optimal use of all resources, and fighting corruption;

   - **improving the system of medical support:** creating the network of mobile military hospitals using land,
aviation and sea transportation;

  - **relieving the Armed Forces from performing non-core functions and tasks: transfer a part of surplus**
infrastructure to the administration of other state or local authorities; complete transition to providing
meals to units through arrangements with commercial structures.

Depending on the level of fulfilment of the aforementioned priorities, further areas of the State Programme of
the Development of Armed Forces will be implemented or adjusted at the end of 2007.

The Ministry of Defence will vigorously defend its position that the Armed Forces must be financed from
the General Fund of the State Budget. The nation’s defence cannot be dependant upon the result of economic
activities of the defence sector.

The Ministry of Defence trusts it will receive the understanding and support of the President, Parliament,
Government and National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine to ensure this financial support.
