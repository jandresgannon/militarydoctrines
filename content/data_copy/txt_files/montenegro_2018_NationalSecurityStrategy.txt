![4_Image_0.Png](4_Image_0.Png)

It has been 13 years since the referendum in 2006, which was organized in cooperation with the EU, when Montenegro restored its statehood in a peaceful, democratic way, following highest European standards, untypical of the Balkans. 

Today, Montenegro isa sovereign, internationally recognized country, achieving national interests through its policies, strategies and activities, while strengthening the international unison, as well as national and cultural identity in all aspects of social life. 

Montenegro inherited a thousand years old liberal state tradition, while historically, culturally and ethnically belonging to European civilization, firmly rooted in antifascism as the fundamental value of its modern statehood. 

In the meantime, we have achieved one of the strategic goals of our foreign policy. Montenegro has become a full member of the NATO alliance, the most successful global defense and security alliance. 

Extraordinary progress has been made in the EU negotiation process. Weare resolutely pursuing reforms in order to prepare the country to be the next member state of the EU. as conditions arise. Montenegro is ultimately committed to the policy of good neighborly relations, which is why it has been recognized by international partners as an important factor of regional stability. Our country respects traditional friendships, but driven by national and state interests. it is focused on new partnerships through the sharing of common ideas and values. 

The preconditions of all our successes are the building of an internal security system and resilience to external destabilizing influences, the democratization of the society, and the promotion of a policy of peace and stability. 

The new National Security Strategy of Montenegro is based precisely on such premises, as it recognizes challenges our society faced and still faces, the current processes on the global level, as well as our status and commitments arising from the NATO membership. The National Security Strategy stems from the sovereignty, territorial integrity and ir,dependence of Montenegro routed in the rule of law, respect for human and minority rights, environmental protection, democracy and economic prosperity. 

The National Security Strategy endorses Montenegro's readiness to preserve its own statehood tradition, affirm and achieve good neighborly cooperation and contribute to the improvement of regional, European and Euro-Atlantic security. The readiness to further strengthen Montenegro's reputation in international relations as well as to protect and strengthen ties with numerous Montenegrin Diaspora is also outlined. 

Through the identification of threats, challenges and risks, the National Security Strategy calls for the awareness raising to respond to them nationwide, but also in cooperation with other states and international organizations, primarily NA TO allies, whose security is inextricably linked with ours, based on the Washington Treaty. 

As the highest strategic document, the Strategy represents a reference point for the preparation of documents in all other spheres, as well as a foundation for the functioning of public authorities and individuals so to ensure the safety of the society, the state and the citizens. 

In achieving national interests, all available resources and means shall be used, implyirig that all elements of national security must be focused towards coordinated, efficient, reliable and proactive action and responsibility 
President of Montenegro Milo Djukanovic

# Introduction

Strategy of National Security of Montenegro(hereinafter: the Strategy) is the most important strategic document that determines the security policy of Montenegro and defines mechanisms and instruments for the realization and protection of national security interests. The strategy represents the starting point for the development of all other strategic documents and plans in the field of security policy. 

This document represents the revision of the 2008 Strategy and reflects the need to redefine Montenegro's security responses in the light of constant and profound changes in the modern security environment, as well as the fact that Montenegro by joining the NATO on 5 June 2017 achieved one of the two key foreign policy goals and has become an integral part of the collective security system. 

The strategy aims to establish a systemic framework for achieving the security interests of Montenegro and it sets out key guidelines for defining national security policies. 

The preconditions for the development of the Strategy are to identify the principles and basic tendencies of the national security policy, to define national security interests and objectives and determine the course of action of all entities in order to provide adequate responses to the current security challenges, risks and threats. The strategy is proactive. It aims to anticipate challenges, risks and threats in a timely manner and analyse them, define them in advance, create conditions for the unity of actions of all relevant entities, ensure efficient and sustainable use of all resources, the necessary resilience and the ability to recover all elements of the security system. 

The strategy is an expression of commitment and consensus of all elements of the system to ensure that Montenegro's security is treated in a unified and comprehensive manner, and in full synergy of the overall elements of the system. The strategy must be sustainable, long-term and subject to change in order to improve the national security system. 

# 1 Basic Commitments Of National Security Policy

Montenegro's security policy is based on the principle of inviolability of security. The safety of citizens and the state of Montenegro is directly dependent on security in the region, Europe and beyond. It is designed and developed within national boundaries, as well as outside of them. A clear separation line between external and internal security no longer exists. 

Montenegro recognized in a timely manner that the best way to guarantee the long-term and sustainable security, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state is precisely the approach to the collective and cooperative security and defence system that the NA TO membership brings. The membership significantly improved the international position of Montenegro and facilitated the fulfilment of the other key foreign policy goal - accession to the European Union. Therefore. active participation in the collective security system, activities, missions and operations of NATO is a key precondition for the protection of Montenegro from armed threats and other recognized threats to national security. Also, strengthening of the transatlantic cooperation. cooperation with partner countries and joining the European Union will further improve the security climate in the region and strengthen the capacities of Montenegro to respond to current challenges, risks and threats. During the drafting of this Strategy, NATO's key strategic documents were considered in detail and their principles were incorporated to the extent possible.Furthermore, the obligations that Montenegro has as a NATO member. in the process of accession negotiations to join the European Union and the need to align our policy with the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the EU, were taken into account. 

# 2 National Security Interests And 

![11_Image_0.Png](11_Image_0.Png) Objectives Of Montenegro

National security interests of Montenegro derive from the fundamental values defined by the Constitution of Montenegro and reflect the most important needs of citizens and the state.

# 3 Elements Of National Policy Of Security 

![14_Image_0.Png](14_Image_0.Png)

Elements of national security policy consist of national security policy, foreign policy, economic policy, defence policy, internal security policy, policy of protection against natural and man-made disasters, human rights protection policies, social policy and other policies. The national security policy of Montenegro is a balanced set of vis ions. strategies, programs. plans and activities to respond to sources of challenges. risks and threats. as well as to achieve national security goals. 

Montenegro's foreign policy priorities are interlinked and complementary. Montenegro. through the founding and implementation of the basic priorities in relations with foreign countries. after membership in NA TO, strives for membership in the European Union. It rs also committed to developing good neighbourly relations and strengthening regional cooperation, both in terms of security, and in other areas of common interest. In this context it is an active member of regional initiatives, follows global trends and is involved in them in accordance with interests and opportunities, with the establishment and maintaining of good relations with a number of the most developed countries in the world, while respecting fully taken international obligations and principles. Economic policy is directly related to the achievement of the objectives of the security policy and aims at achieving economic stability in the country, creating conditions for domestic and foreign investments and allowing for continuous economic growth and development. Under the conditions of stable economic policy, the probability of emerging challenges. risks and threats is reduced. The defence policy of Montenegro is focused on developing military capacities and capabilities necessary for carrying out dedicated missions and tasks in the country and within the framework of the collective security system. Defence policy provides further development of military capabilities in line with NATO's defence planning process. The internal security policy is based on respecting the constitutional principles. as well as the principles of international law and obligations of Montenegro on the international level. The internal security policy provides protection of the constitutionally established legal order, democracy, human rights and freedoms, public order and peace and other social values. The policy of protection against natural and man-made disasters is aimed at creating conditions for the comprehensive management of natural and other disasters within a single system of crisis management in accordance with NATO policies and principles. This implies prevention activities, timely preparation and adequate response to disasters, as well as the provision of basic living conditions and reconstruction in the affected areas. The policy is focused on strengthening preventive measures. 

systematic measures for timely forecasting, detection. monitoring and warning of disasters, creation of quality organization of protection, rescue and reconstruction forces at all levels. and establishing active international cooperation in this field. Human rights protection policy is based on international standards for the protection of these rights and freedoms, that is, the principles proclaimed in the Constitution of Montenegro. 

Social policy is based on universal and Constitutionally defined values, and it promotes equal social justice rights for all citizens of Montenegro. the cohesion of all ethnic, cultural and other social groups, social inclusion, and it strongly opposes all forms of negative discrimination. Montenegro's social policy faces a growing challenge of globalization that causes labour migration, especially the outflow of specific profiles of highly educated personnel. 

4 SECURITY ENVIRONMENT 

![15_image_0.png](15_image_0.png)

![15_image_1.png](15_image_1.png)

## 4.1. Strategic Context (Global Environment)

Global security environment is characterized by constant and dynamic changes, unpredictability and interaction of various security factors and trends. Security risks, challenges and threats are conventional and asymmetric, hybrid in nature and of a global character. One of the characteristic aspects of the modern security environment is that the security of every state can be directly threatened by instabilities and conflicts that occur outside of its borders, or the borders of the region or the continent in which it is located. The border between internal and external security is becoming increasingly dim. 

which requires radical changes in the approach to security and defence. It is Vital to establish mechanisms and methods for prevention, urgent and effective response and, ultimately, neutralizing the impact of unforeseen challenges, risks and threats, primarily through coordinated engagement of civil and military mechanisms. 

## 4.2. Regional Context (Regional Environment)

The security situation in Montenegro should also be observed within a regional context. Montenegro regionally belongs to both the Balkans and the Mediterranean, and to the sub regional Adriatic basin. It is part of the region that has undergone dramatic changes and a civil war in the previous period. 

Having in mind the historical heritage and positive trends after the renewal of independence, Montenegro has a specific place and a significant role in the stability of the region. In addition, Montenegro shares a strategic approach to the challenges, risks and threats to national security that are defined in NA TO strategic documents. The spectrum of challenges, risks and threats is broad. The region is still burdened with events from the past and unsolved issues that may cause destabilization in certain areas. As a consequence of the reduction of military personnel and equipment in the region, the integration of countrres into NA TO and the EU, and the development of a policy of trust, cooperation and partnership, the risk of direct military threat to Montenegro have significantly decreased today, but cannot be ruled out. Geostrategic changes have influenced the fact that the Western Balkans again became a zone of strong interest by certain international actors whose primary goal is to prevent the further European and Euro-Atlantic paths of certain countries in the region. This triggers concrete actions towards the region, especially of the hybrid character, which is a serious security challenge and can have significant consequences for regional stability and slow down integration processes. 

Given the geographical situation, the security of Montenegro can be adversely affected by crisis in the immediate environment, but also by the crisis in more distant regions such as Eastern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, and the Black Sea and Caspian Sea and Caucasus regions. In these areas, which are destabilized by crises, conflicts, demographic growth and the reduction of strategic resources (water, energy), there is a growing manifestation of transnational threats and the transmission, or the overflow of crises towards the European continent. 

# 5 Security Challenges, Risks And Threats 

![16_Image_0.Png](16_Image_0.Png)

Armed aggression poses a real threat to national security, although the likelihood of the outbreak of conventional armed conflicts is significantly reduced. 

Terrorism and violent extremism, as methods of achieving political and other goals, directly undermine the vital and strategic interests of the state, institutions of the system, critical infrastructure. supply and provision of basic services to the population. The threat of terrorism in Montenegro is present but of low intensity. Nevertheless, terrorism is at the very top of the identified risks and threats to the security of Montenegro. Prevention, fighting and detection of all forms of terrorism is not only a basic task of all state bodies and institutions, but also of the entire community including religious communities, education system, civil sector, media, etc. Hate speech, or advocacy of hatred and intolerance based on ethnicity, race. religion or any other ground, especially when used by religious and/ or politicaleaders, is one of the motivational factors of radicalization, and should be treated with special care. 

Consideration of financial flows, as a prerequisite for carrying out terrorist activities, is one of the priorities in order to define an adequate response to this security threat, especially in the area of possible links between organized criminal and/or political groups and terrorist organizations. The proliferation of conventional weapons and weapons for mass destruction (nuclear, chemical and biological) represents a real threat to international peace and security, as well as to the security of Montenegro. The possibility of a terrorist or criminal group getting into the possession of conventional weapons and weapons for mass destruction gives a new di mens ion to this threat. In line with the recommendations and efforts of the international community directed against organized crime and terrorism. the need for an effective and coordfnated undertaking of activities aimed at combating illegal production. acquisition, possession, trafficking and smuggling of small arms and light weapons and ammunition, as well as all other abuses. requires continuous cooperation of all ministries and other state administration bodies. Cyber Threats - The cyberspace is recognized as the fourth domain of warfare that does not recognize the state borders and enables execution of activities in the virtual space that have implications in the real world. The introduction of new technologies, both in the field of information and communication systems. as well as in the area of industrial control systems and their interconnectedness. contributes to a higher quality of life and business, but also opens up new chapters of some old, conventional but also completely new challenges, risks and threats to national security. Individuals. groups, organizations, government agencies. and military units from the cyberspace perform their illegal and/or offensive activities located in the close vicinity of the target or at the distance of thousands of kilometres. T@ffic infrastructure, telecommunication network, health and social system, media space, financial system, energy and utility systems are just some of the areas whose functioning can be partially or completely endangered by action from cyberspace. In addition to material damage from cyberspace. it is possible to endanger human lives. Cyber threats often manifest themselves along with other threats. This complex area requires the full synergy of all elements of the national security system and the full co-operation of all system owners and service providers. Hybrid threats, through all manifestations and specific mechanisms of soft force, represent a new form of modern warfare. Complex mechanisms of hybrid action, which can include strong propaganda, cyber-attacks, the formation of para-institutions, organizations and the media, and increasingly the interference in electoral processes, imposes the need to build and improve capacities for opposing and strengthening resistance to this security challenge. Given that Montenegro has also been affected by these activities, and that such trends are present in other member states of the Alliance. priority is given to the building of adequate defence mechanisms at all levels of society, in particular in the security and defence sector, in accordance with standards applied within the framework of the collective security system. Organized crime represents a complex and long-term threat to international and national security. It is characterized by flexibility, adaptability, recovery and mobility. The activities of organized crime groups that pose the highest security threat are: smuggling of narcotics, trafficking in human beings (illegal migration), weapons smuggling, smuggling of goods, corruption, laundering and forgery of money, as well as forging documents. Of particular importance for the seriousness of the threat is the possible connection between organized criminal groups and terrorist organizations, as well as the engagement of organized criminal groups in the smuggling of weapons and hazardous materials. Organized crime and the consequences itbrings (destabilization of state institutions, violation of legal order, disturbance of the economic system and corruption) represent a security risk for Montenegro. In a modern security environment, there are a large number of challenges, risks and threats that can pose a **threat to public security.** The threat to public security can be manifested through individual attacks on the lives and property of citizens or massive violations of laws and order that, as a consequence of geopolitical turmoil in the world, can serve as a way to achieve the foreign policy goals of other states. The threat to economic and energy security is a serious security challenge for every country Apart from the fact that economic and financial instability leads to political and social quakes, they are most often a catalyst for all other forms of security threats. **Energy security,** especially in the context of the energy policy of the states of major suppliers, has a major impact on overall international political and security developments. The fact that the energy supply mechanism is used to achieve political goals, or for the destabilization of rival countries and regions, results in the fact that energy security and diversification of sources and suppliers becomes increasingly important. Due to the growing connection between energy security and climate change, further efforts are needed to develop and protect renewable energy sources. It is therefore necessary to recognize the importance of economic and energy security and define measures and activities in accordance with national interests and priorities. The high population growth in the countries of Africa and Asia, mainly with authoritarian regimes and weak state institutions, accompanied by poverty, inequality and war and religious conflicts, has resulted during the last decade in **illegal migration** to the countries of Western Europe as a consequence, which is a serious security challenge. The situation is particularly aggravated by conflicts in the region of the Middle East and North Africa, whose ending is still not visible and has caused the movement of an extremely large number of migrants and refug.ees to Europe. The fact that Montenegro is on the tracks of these movements is a serious humanitarian, but also a security challenge. 

The increasingly complex geopolitical relations in the world that have caused the economic, political and geostrategic interests of global and regional powers to be disrupted also in the Western Balkans and, consequently, in Montenegro, they have affected the intensified **intelligence activity** of certain states and systems In parallel with the classic collection of information from various spheres, carriers of intelligence activities through the parallel application of mechanisms of hybrid action, seek to influence political elites and public opinion, in order to create conditions for establishing and influencing the processes and stability of Montenegro, which represents a long-term security challenge. 

Modern societies are increasingly dependent on complex systems for providing key services that enable the normal functioning of the state, society and citizens. Providing key services directly depends on the functionality of critical infrastructure. **The threat or destruction of critical infrastructure** 
elements can have a direct impact on Montenegro's national security in all its dimensions, especially if it is implemented as part of a hybrid attack involving this, but also other areas of action (propaganda, disinformation, cyber-attacks, and terrorism). In the domain of threatening or destroying elements of critical infrastructure, industrial control systems whose misuse might cause adverse consequences for security have special significance. The globalization of the telecommunication market brings numerous benefits to end users, but relocation of some of the information and communication infrastructure and services outside the territory of Montenegro represents a significant security challenge and a real risk. The economic stability of Montenegro is largely related to tourist activities at sea. Therefore, **the safety** of the sea, submarine and the seabed is of strategic importance for Montenegro. which responsibly approaches the protection and preservation of the coastal area. as well as the Montenegrin sea bed. 

Increased frequency of sea traffic increases the possibility of incidents at sea. Incidents involving tankers or ships carrying chemical, hazardous or noxious substances can have extremely negative effects on the ecosystem of the sea as well as on the economy of the entire region. Natural and man-caused accidents and disasters, besides the great damage they inflict on the natural environment, threaten the safety of Montenegro and its citizens and leave great economic consequences. For Montenegro, a country with limited human and material resources, in which earthquakes and associated destructive manifestations, extreme weather events, floods and regional scale fires, technical and technological accidents, road accident and explosion disasters, major traffic accidents, damage to large electric power plants and hydro technical facilities and chemical and radiation contaminations are recognized as hazards, as well as a wide range of biological hazards, epidemics and/or pandemics, the organization of an adequate protection and rescue system is a challenge. Hazards are inevitable, and their elimination is impossible. so that by observing traditional practices and experience with the application of a number of technical and other measures, it seeks to reduce the economic and social extent of the accident. In that sense, it is necessary to make a shift from the practice of responding to the event towards the practice of prevention Montenegro has not yet developed full capacity to reduce the risk of disasters in all its segments. Lack of natural resources and environmental degradation are a consequence of climate change, large emissions of harmful gases, uncontrolled and imp roper use ot natural resources. Climate change, as one ot the biggest problems of today, results in intense and frequent occurrences of large and disastrous fires, snowdrifts, floods, extreme weather events, earthquakes and other natural disasters that endanger the lives and health of people, adversely affect the environment and pose a threat for the survival of many plant and animal species, as well as cultural heritage. 

# 6 Montenegro And Security Challenges, 

![19_Image_0.Png](19_Image_0.Png) Risks And Threats

Achieving the desired level of security is a precondttion for the welfare of the state, society and every individual. Security ensures progress and prosperity in all fields, guarantees domestic and foreign investments and is a tourism catalyst. It contributes to the quality of life and the international reputation of the state. 

A qualitative and complete analysis of security challenges, risks and threats, economic opportunities of the state and a rational understanding of its capacities determine the modalities of response to each of the challenges, risks and threats. The basic principles for defining the answer are: a) Unity of actions - coordinated and harmonized engagement of all state entities and resources, cooperation of state and civil authorities, institutions and organizations and engagement of the society as a whole; b) Predicting and preventing - timely identification of situations that may pose potential risk to national security; c) Efficient use of all resources is a principle that is based on prioritizing resources and their optimal use; d) Resilience and the ability to recover - enable the ability to flexibly engage human and material resources in order to reduce or mitigate possible negative consequences. Within the concept of civilian readiness, cooperation between state institutions, the civil and private sectors should be enabled, as new security challenges require the response of the whole society. 

## 6.1. Montenegrin'S Responses To Security Challenges, Risks And Threats

The defence against armed aggression is based on the development of military capacities and capabilities that will ensure the implementation of all assigned missions and tasks on a national and international level. Developing national defence capacities and capabilities creates the necessary prerequisites for successfully neutralizing direct or indirect armed threats and reacting in crisis situations, independently or in cooperation with NATO allies. The National Commitment to the Collective Security System. first of all through the NATO Alliance membership and active engagement in multinational missions and operations, contributes to the protection of national interests. The Armed Forces of Montenegro are constantly adapting to the challenges of a modern security environment, and the basic mechanisms in this process are the efficient use of all resources and capacities, the implementation of NA TO standards and the achievement of the required level of interoperability. In the future, the declared compositions of the Armed Forces of Montenegro will be capable of engaging in multinational, conventional and asymmetric. unified military operations, and modern military equipment and weapons will provide maximum protection during the implementation of tasks. Montenegro rejects terrorism as a method and means of achieving any kind of interest The main goal of the fight against terrorism is to neutralize the threat. reduce the vulnerability of society to terrorist attacks, and prevent all activities that lead to the radicalization of individuals or groups. Montenegro's response to terrorism, violent extremism and radicalization will be based on strengthening national capacities to combat these challenges, coordinating the activities of all entities within the state and strengthening international co-operation in this field. 

Montenegro will undertake all available proactive measures and activities to combat terrorism at the national, regional and international levels, including measures to prevent terrorist radicalization, recruitment and financing of terrorism. Montenegro consistently implements all obligations arising from international agreements, treaties and other binding documents related to the prevention of the proliferation of conventional and weapons of mass destruction, as well as in relation to the prevention of illegal trade, possession, and the accumulation of small arms and light weapons. Cyber Security aims to ensure the safe use of information networks and systems through the prevention, detection and provision of adequate responses to cyber-attacks. In order to adequately respond to high-tech crime in Montenegro, it is necessary to undertake more organizational, administrative and technical measures and to improve the exchange of data with the surrounding countries. Strengthening the competencies and capacities of the Special Prosecutor's Office to combat high-tech crime and signing agreements on mutual cooperation between the private and public sectors represent some of the key priorities in the coming period. Montenegrin responses to the fight against organized crime are based on a wide range of preventive measures and procedures, active cooperation with international and regional organizations and legal repressive measures. Montenegro continues to strengthen its national capacity to fight organized crime and actively exchanges information with foreign police, security and intelligence services. Preventing the threat to public safety implies early detection, prevention and prosecution of all types of criminal activities. To that end, it is necessary to provide a joint and coordinated work of judicial and executive authorities, as well as the support of all other subjects of the national security system. Montenegro will continue to protect its borders in accordance with international and national regulations. Defining clear preventive measures and preventive action wil I prevent any serious threat to public order and peace. Maintaining economic and financial stability cor1tributes to sustainable economic development, negative market trends are neutralized. criminal activities are prevented, the international economic presence of Montenegro strengthens and economic and financial resistance is provided. Montenegro has made significant improvements in capacity building for migration management. 

Montenegro has built the institutional, legislative and administrative structure of migration management and is currently on the path to a comprehensive rounding up of an effective operational structure. There is no defined lead agency for migration issues. Nominally, this responsibility belongs to the Ministry of Interior. However, there is an overriding need to work on increasing engagement and involvement of other relevant authorities, as well as on strengthening inter-ministerial co-operation, in order to establish robust coordination structures. Montenegro undertakes all necessary legal measures and activities in the fight against trafficking in human beings, primarily with the aim of protecting the safety of its own citizens, but also in order to prevent criminal groups from using or recruiting migrants for criminal activities. Control of illegal migration prevents the uncontrolled flow of migrants into Montenegro, supervision and control of their migration movements are performed when entering Montenegro, and in case of entry, control over their further movement is exercised. Montenegro is determined to improve the legal framework, institutions and administrative capacities, cooperate with other countries and international organizations, and the ultimate goal is to establish a society with an efficient system and recognizable results in the field of integrated migration management, which will contribute to regional and overall stability in accordance with the rules and EU standards. Strengthening intelligence, counterintelligence and security capabilities is based on the definition and implementation of measures and activities for the prevention, detection and neutralization of intelligence activities of other states, their intelligence services and individuals, with the aim of defending the strategic, political and economic interests of Montenegro. By enhancing the international cooperation of civilian and military services, on a bilateral and multilateral basis, a comprehensive approach in achieving national interests is provided. 

Montenegro will make additional efforts to further develop the national capacities in response to natural and man-made disasters, epidemics and pandemics, taking into account the multiplicative effects that it may have. Establishing full cooperation and coordination between entities at the state and local level is a priority, as well as cooperation with neighbouring countries, especially in border areas. Through its membership in international organizations. Montenegro actively exchanges information about the sources of natural and man-made disasters and the consequences that they can have in the region and beyond, while simultaneously engaging their capacities to provide concrete assistance. 

Montenegro will continue equable development of capacities for responding to natural and manmade disasters, with the establishment of full co-operation and coordination between entities at the state and local level, as well as through the mechanism of cooperation with neighbouring countries, especially in border areas. In order to reduce the risks and potential consequences. the focus is on strengthening disaster risk management capacity and networking of all institutions, relevant sectors and stakeholders to act in the event of disasters. The prevention of new and the reduction of existing risks, through the implementation of comprehensive and integrated measures, reduces and prevents the exposure and vulnerability of the society, but also increases readiness for response and reconstruction. By bilateral and cooperation with international institutions and organizations, Montenegro has gained new quality in the field of protection and rescue and has undertaken the commitment to actively participate in the preparation of the world community for creating conditions for quick response in case of natural and other disasters. 

Safety at sea is realized through coordinated activities and cooperation of all entities that have maritime competencies. optimization, rationalization and integration of available resources and by their efficient use. At the inter-institutional level, cooperation contributes to more efficient protection of marine flora and fauna, cultural assets in offshore, geological and other resources in the territorial sea, and the reduction of crime rates. International cooperation through the collective security system and the ADRION initiative contributes to the preservation of peace, stability and protection of Montenegro's interests in extra-territorial and international waters in accordance with international law of the sea, ratified conventions and international treaties and assumed obligations from the NA TO membership. Protection of critical infrastructure represents the general obligation of all elements of the system. By identification and list of critical infrastructures on land, sea, under the sea, in the air and in the cyberspace, by defining the responsible carriers of protection and coordination of activities at all levels, quality planning, response efficiency and, consequently, resilience of critical infrastructure are ensured. This concept is closely linked to NA TO guidelines for strengthening resilience and civilian readiness, which provide a comprehensive response from society and systems to all kinds of threats. Also, by protecting critical infrastructure through the concept of resilience and civilian readiness (independently, but also in cooperation with NATO and EU allies and partners through the exchange of data. experiences and good practices). energy security is strengthened and unimpeded energy supply is ensured, and by the development of renewable energy sources, adverse effects of climate change are eliminated. One of the priority tasks in this field is the adoption of laws and criteria on critical infrastructure. Particular emphasis should be placed on developing capacities for protection and response to threats and activities from a hybrid arsenal, which can be manifested through a combination of attacks on critical infrastructure, cyber-attacks on information systems and industrial control systems, propaganda and informational campaigns, but also other violent and non-violent activities. This approach, with the continuous exchange of data, practices, knowledge and experience in this area, provides an adequate response at the national, regional and within the Alliance. 

Energy security is closely related to the concepts of resilience, civilian readiness and critical infrastructure protection, which requires continuous development of adequate nationalcapacities. Montenegro's trong commitment to protecting the environment and combating the adverse effects of climate change (which is a political, economic, and security challenge) imposes the need to develop renewable energy sources. Montenegro, as an ecological state, pays special attention to the protection of natural resources and environment. Montenegro's responses to the endangering of natural resources and the environment include reduction of air pollution, especially in certain urban areas, reduction of soil pollution, efficient water management. prevention of uncontrolled felling of forests. solving waste issues and promoting recycling, as well as reducing noise and electromagnetic radiation. 

Montenegro is also proactive in its commitment to peace and stability, coexistence of various communities, inclusion and open door policy through active participation in regional and global security forums and initiatives.

The existence of a strong but flexible national security system capable of adapting and effectively, ad - equately and fully responding to all contemporary security challenges, risks and threats is one of the prerequisites for achieving national security goals and interests and preserving national security. The preservation of national security is achieved through the optimal, integrated and flexible functioning of all elements of the system. The basic principles on which the national security system is based are: leadership and clear political guidelines; the unity of actions of all the entities of the system; efficient and sustainable use of all available resources; constant modernization of system elements: resilience of the system and the ability to recover; cooperation with the civil sector; exchange of information and knowledge; integrity and transparency. 

The management of the national security system is regulated by the Constitution of Montenegro, laws and regulations implementing the national security system. Integrated management of the national security system ensures the coordination and cooperation of various organizations and institutions that perform joint and combined civil. police and military duties at the state or local self-government level in situations of regular, emergency, and state of war and in crisis situations. 

## 7.1. Structure Of The National Security System

The national security system consists of basic and special elements. The main elements of the system are: the Parliament of Montenegro, the President of Montenegro, the Government of Montenegro, the Council for Defence and Security, the Public Prosecutor's Office and courts, the security forces (the Armed Forces of Montenegro and police forces) and the intelligence and security sector. 

Special elements of the national security system are: citizens, local self-government, forces for action in emergency situations, voluntary citizen associations, companies, private security agencies and security services. national hunting organization, radio amateurs and other subjects of importance for security and defence. 

Parliament of Montenegro adopts laws; adopts rntional strategy for security and strategy for defence; declares war and state of emergency; decides on the use of forces in international missions, exercises control over the Armed Forces and security services. It is responsible for securing legal requirements for the functioning of the security and defence sector. Parliamentary control and oversight of the bodies and services of the national security system is carried out by the Committee for Security and Defence. The President of Montenegro presides over the Council for Defence and Security, commands the Armed Forces on the basis of U,e decisions of the Council for Defence and Security and decides on its use, in accordance with the law. The Government of Montenegro runs the national security policy by proposing a strategy for national security, defence strategy and laws in this area; by implementing the strategy of national security; by monitoring the state of national security; by adopting a Decree with the force of law during the state of emergency or state of war, if the Parliament of Montenegro is unable to meet; by determining the organization of work of state administration bodies in case of emergency or state of war; by concluding and taking care of implementation of international treaties from the field of national security and compatibility of national laws with international documents; by providing material and financial resources for the needs of the national security system and the required level of operational and combat capability of the security forces. 

The Council for Defence and Security makes decisions on the command of the Armed Forces of Montenegro; analyses and assesses the security situation in Montenegro and makes decisions for undertaking appropriate measures; proposes to the Parliament the proclamation of war and state of emergency; proposes the use of the Armed Forces in international forces. The Council for Defence and Security of Montenegro consists of: President of Montenegro, President of the Parliament and President of the Government. 

The State Prosecutor's Office, as a single and independent state body, performs the tasks of prosecuting perpetrators of criminal offenses and other offenses that are prosecuted ex officio. Courts judge on the basis of the Constitution, laws and confirmed and published international treaties, for the purpose of special and general prevention, as well as expressing social conviction for the criminal offense and obligations of respecting the law, including the strengthening of ethics and the influence on the development of social responsibility. 

The Armed Forces of Montenegro are a defence force that. independently or with the support of allied forces. defends the independence, sovereignty and state territory of Montenegro and contributes to the collective security system of the NATO Alliance, in accordance with the principles of international law. The contribution to international peace and security and the protection of interests of Montenegro, the Armed Forces carry out both by defence diplomacy and measures for strengthening security and confidence at the regional and global level. The Armed Forces of Montenegro can be engaged with available resources also in supporting civilian institutions and citizens in countering non-military challenges, risks and threats when civil institutions do not have enough capacity to protect national interests and internal security on their own. The Police Administration carries out tasks related to: protection of citizensÂ· safety and the constitutionally established rights and freedoms; protection of property; preventing the commission and detection of criminal offenses and misdemeanours; finding and capturing the perpetrators of criminal offenses and misdemeanours and bringing them before the competent authorities; maintenance of public order and peace; securing public meetings and other gatherings of citizens; securing certain persons and facilities; surveillance and control of safety in traffic; surveillance and securing state border and conducting border control; control of movement and residence of foreigners; maintaining order, protecting individuals and property independently and through various forms of international police cooperation. The intelligence and security sector is part of the national security system of Montenegro. The intelligence and security sector is comprised of the National Security Agency of Montenegro and the authority responsible for providing intelligence, counterintelligence and security matters of importance to the defence, as well as state administration bodies that, within the prescribed competencies, collect, process. analyse, use, exchange. keep and protect intelligence security information. 

The direction and coordination of the work of the bodies constituting the intelligence and security sector is carried out by the **National Security Council,** and **the** operational coordination and harmonization of the activities of the bodies that constitute the intelligence and security sector is performed by the **Bureau** for Operational Coordination. The basics of the intelligence and security sector of Montenegro and the mutual cooperation, direction, coordination and harmonization of the work of the bodies constituting the intelligence and security sector are closely regulated by the Law on the Basis of the Intelligence and Security Sector of Montenegro. 

## 7.2. States Of National Security

Depending on the degree of danger for national security, the security state in Montenegro can be: regular, state of emergency and state of war. Regular state constitutes circumstances in void of significant real threats against the national security enabling the public authority structures and citizens to freely work and perform their regular tasks. 

State of emergency constitutes the situation in which the level of danger for national security has been realistically appraised as exceptionally high and requiring the undertaking of special measures for the security of state. During state of emergency, normal functioning of public structures is seriously and completely endangered State of war constitutes situations when Montenegro is in immediate danger of war, when a war is declared against or when it has been attacked. Establishing the level of danger for each of these states, relevant indicators and measures that need to be undertaken in all of these cases and other relevant details are regulated by the law. 

## 7.3. Crisis Management

Crisis management is one of the key NATO tasks. It represents a coordinated use of elements of diplomatic, information, military and economic power in a complex security environment in order to prevent the crisis, prevent the escalation of a dispute into an armed conflict and overcome hostilities in the event of their appearance. As a full member of NA TO, Montenegro will recognize the state of the crisis, as one of the states of national security, and develop a crisis management system compatible with the NA TO system. In order to establish a unified crisis management system in Montenegro, it is necessary to: 
Adopt a legal framework that will clearly and precisely define the competencies and responsibilities of all elements of the system and their interaction with local self-governments and the civil sector: 
Establish an integrated national early warning and alert system. define clear criteria for assessing sources and potential security challenges. risks and threats, and measures to respond to them and Standardize training and equipment in the crisis management system. 

The establishment of a legislative framework that will clearly define the positions and roles of the elements of the national crisis management system and prescribe the decision-making process as a response to a wide range of crises is the activity is of high priority. This framework will define the place, role and competence of all elements in the national crisis management system, a unified system of management and command will be established, the processes of planning the measures and activities of the response to the crisis will be synchronized and the conditions for their full implementation will be ensured. One of the priority tasks is to define the position and structure of the national Situation Centre for Crisis Management and its accelerated establishment. After establishing the system through crisis management exercises, at the national level and within the NATO crisis response system, the crisis management system, capacities and capabilities of Montenegro to respond to various security challenges, risks and threats will be periodically checked. 

## 7.4. Resources

The effective functioning of the national security system depends directly on the availability of necessary resources, but also on their adequate utilization. The basic resources of the national security system are human and material. 

Human resources are the basis for development qf a national security system. The extent and availability of human resources are conditioned by demographic and other factors. 

New security challenges, risks and threats require new skills and modern training. Development, education and training of personnel are crucial for development of a successful security system in Montenegro. To that end, it is necessary to use all available mechanisms in order to improve national capacities. Material resources include natural, economic, financial, energy, health, information and other potentials of Montenegro and commodity reserves. For the purposes of crisis management, it is necessary to establish commodity reserves and to establish a system of continuity in the provision of key goods and services. The development of mobile tertiary healthcare systems for responding to crisis situations is one of the future priorities. 

Financial resources for the functioning and reform of the security and defence system are provided by the Law on the Budget of Montenegro. Budgetary funds for security and defence related needs are planned and used in a transparent manner, which is compatible with UN standards and criteria, EU and NATO recommendations and within the financial possibilities of the state of Montenegro. Montenegro is committed to using the available resources in a rational manner and integrating it wherever justified and possible, for the purpose of more efficient development and functioning of the national security system. Engaging human and material resources and controlling their use in the national security system is regulated by the law.

The strategy is a document that reflects the security interests of citizens, society and the state in the context of a modern security environment. The initial assumptions in the drafting of the document were the preservation of the highest constitutional values and the creation of conditions for achieving national goals and interests. The document analyses the geostrategic and geopolitical position of Montenegro, defines national goals, interests and security threats, risks and challenges that Montenegro faces and that it can face in the near future. Furthermore, instruments and mechanisms for development, protection and implementation of national interests of Montenegro were identified, independently and in cooperation with allies and partners. 

The Strategy clearly presents to the domestic and international public the strategic security determination of Montenegro, as well as the intentions for further improvement of the national security system and contribution to international peace and security. 

The strategy is the basis for the normative regulation of the national security system and the starting document for the development of all strategies in the field of national security. The strategy is a dynamic document and, as such, is subject to change aimed at improving the national security system. The task of all state authorities is to constantly update and improve the document. 

Implementation of the Strategy will create the conditions for achieving the vision of a democratic, brighter, prosperous and internationally respected state. The key preconditions for the successful implementation of the Strategy are the definition of a legal framework for crisis management, the adoption of laws and bylaws that will define the issue of critical infrastructure as well as amendments to existing legal solutions in order to improve the national security system. 

The Government of Montenegro will report to the Parliament of Montenegro on the implementation of the Strategy.
