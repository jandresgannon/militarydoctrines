##### SECURITY ENVIRONMENT

#### In an environment of evolving security challenges,
###### which include non-traditional and asymmetric threats, India pursues a robust and autonomous defence and security strategy which involves the strengthening of her own capacity to deal with such challenges, while also engaging with and contributing to regional and global efforts to promote peace and stability


1.1 India enjoys a strategic location

with reference to continental Asia and the
Indian Ocean Region. The Indian peninsular
landmass covers an area of 3.3 million square
km and its population of over 1 billion people
encompasses a vast range of ethnic, religious,
cultural and linguistic diversities.

1.2 The over 15,000 km long land borders

which India shares with seven neighbours
(Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar,
China, Bhutan and Nepal) range over terrain
that is as diverse as her people. The Northern
borders are marked by Himalayan peaks at

upto 28,000 feet; the Western border stretches
through deserts, fertile plains and thickly
forested mountains; the North Eastern frontier
comprises high ranges and dense tropical forests.
India is flanked to its East, West and South by
the Bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea and the Indian
Ocean. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands
are located 1300 km away from the nearest
point on our East Coast and are strategically
important in relation to the entrance to the
Malacca Strait. The Lakshadweep and Minicoy
Islands lie about 450 km from the nearest land


point on the West Coast in the Arabian Sea, on

the eastward sea lane of communication from

the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea.

1.3 India’s geographical area, strategic

location, trade links and its EEZ connect its

security environment directly with its extensive

neighbourhood, particularly neighbouring

countries and the regions of Central Asia, South
East Asia, the Gulf and the Indian Ocean. In

an increasingly globalised environment, these

factors involve concomitant security concerns,

responsibilities and challenges.

1.4 While geo-strategic imperatives play

a defining role in our security paradigm,

economic and social imperatives also shape

our security concerns and objectives. The

economy is growing rapidly and is among

the fastest rising in the region and the world.

The trajectory of India’s national development

is based on the core values of democracy,

secularism and peaceful co-existence. A stable

and peaceful regional and global environment

is necessary to achieve the aim of growth and

prosperity for our citizens.


-----

1.5  In an environment of evolving security

challenges, which include non-traditional and

asymmetric threats, India pursues a robust and

autonomous defence and security strategy

which involves the strengthening of her

own capacity to deal with such challenges,

while also engaging with and contributing to

regional and global efforts to promote peace

and stability.

###### THE GLOBAL SECURITY ENVIRONMENT

1.6 Our security environment is deeply

affected by global and regional developments.

A number of trends have a vital bearing on

India’s security.

1.7 While the global economy showed

some revival in the wake of the 2008 global

economic crisis, the danger is clearly far from

over. The international financial crisis is a

major cause of worry for the


full scale inter-state wars is reckoned by
many analysts to have reduced, the security
environment has become complex, with
incidence of low intensity conflicts and
asymmetric threats taking various forms,
including domestic and trans-national

terrorism, narco-terrorism, cyber warfare and
piracy.

1.10 Despite international efforts, the

threat from terrorism remains as potent as
ever. Advances in telecommunications and
improvements in international commercial
logistics have combined to increase the range
and effects of terrorist activities, providing
the physical means to transcend even the
most secure borders and with the potential to
cause serious damage to global political and
economic systems. There is continuing concern
over the immediate neighbourhood remaining
a hub for international terrorist organisations.


global economy.

1.8 The rise of countries

like India, China, Brazil

and South Africa are

developments of global

significance. The trend holds

promise and opportunities,

as well as challenges.

1.9 Global security

continues to be adversely

affected by continuing

conflict and violence in

the world. Even though the

probability of conventional


###### Even though the probability

 by many analysts to have

 environment has become

 complex, with incidence of

 low intensity conflicts and

 asymmetric threats taking

 various forms, including

 domestic and trans-national

 terrorism, narco-terrorism,

 cyber warfare and piracy.


1.11 The threat of

piracy and terrorism to
international trade and

safety of the sea lanes
of communication has

emerged as a major problem.

The spread of piracy to
areas close to our western
seaboard has made this a
cause of greater concern.

1.12 The non
proliferation and nuclear

security efforts continue to

face challenges on account
of clandestine nuclear


-----

programmes in some countries. The danger

of nuclear materials falling into the hands of

non-state actors and terrorists remains a matter

of concern. Although the ratification of the

New START between the US and Russia was

a positive development, progress towards

global nuclear disarmament and the complete

elimination of nuclear weapons is uncertain.

1.13 In view of the multifaceted security

concerns and the global dimensions of

the challenges, India has strengthened its

participation in multilateral institutions and

deepened its strategic partnerships with various

countries.

1.14 The security situation in East Asia

increased security concerns amongst several

nations and underlined the need for initiatives

for building trust and confidence in the region.

The establishment of the ASEAN Defence

Ministers Meeting Plus forum of ten ASEAN and

eight non-ASEAN countries, including India,


is seen as an effort to establish an open and
inclusive security architecture for the region.
India’s policy is to encourage and participate in
cooperative approaches which would enable
all countries in the region to counter traditional
and non-traditional security challenges and to
ensure that the critical sea lanes in the region
are kept open, secure and free for navigation
and trade. India’s involvement in the ADMM
Plus and various other ASEAN fora is a part of
our progressive and multifaceted partnership

with the East Asian region. At the same time,

India is also mindful of the evolving dynamics
of power rivalries in the region and their impact
on the region and on our national interests.

1.15 The salience of Africa in international

security is increasing. A number of unresolved
inter and intra national conflicts in the continent
have global resonance. India has traditional
historic ties with a number of African countries,
which acquire an added strategic dimension in
view of the emerging security challenges. The

-----

threat of piracy emerging from Somalian waters
continues to endanger the safety of the sea lanes
and is a matter of concern for the international
community. The linkages between terrorists
based in Somalia and trans-national organized
crime is also a cause of major concern globally.
The Indian Navy has been actively involved in
combating maritime piracy in the region on
its own and in coordination with the navies of
other countries. India has also been actively
involved in peacekeeping operations in Africa

under the UN mandate and seeks to consolidate

its relations with many countries in the region
with which we have historical linkages.

1.16 The recent political developments in


insurgency in Afghanistan, spread of terrorism

and radicalism in the region and the inadequacy

of responses in some countries. On the positive

side, the democratic process in the region is

being consolidated in most countries and

hurdles in the way of regional cooperation are

being addressed. There are signs of economic

recovery in the region. A secure, stable peaceful

and prosperous neighbourhood is central to

India’s security construct. India continues to

pursue active and collaborative engagements

with her neighbours with a view to promoting

mutual understanding, regional peace and

stability.

1.18 Security concerns vis-à-vis Pakistan

continue to raise apprehensions due to the

undiminished activities of terrorist organisations

from its territory. The continued infiltrations

across the LoC and the existence of terrorist

camps across the India-Pak border demonstrate

the continuing ambivalence of Pakistan in its

attitude and approach to terrorist organisations,

even though such organisations pose a danger

to Pakistan’s own social and political fabric.

India supports dialogue with


West Asia and North Africa and the evolving
dynamics of the internal situation in various
countries are being watched by the international
community. The impact of these developments
on the security situation in the region and on
the security of energy supplies is of global
concern. India has long standing, warm and
wide-ranging relations with all countries in the
region and will continue to engage with them
on the basis of mutuality of
respect and interests.

Pakistan. However, Pakistan

needs to take effective steps

to address India’s concerns

concern to India. The

by a Taliban led insurgency. India remains
committed to supporting the people and
Government of Afghanistan as they build a
stable, peaceful, pluralistic, democratic and
prosperous Afghanistan.

1.20 India’s relations with the China are

of crucial importance. The effort has been to
work on areas of mutual interest which would
enable both countries to pursue common goals
of growth and development. India is conscious
and watchful of the implications of China’s
evolving military profile in the immediate and
extended neighbourhood. India’s policy is to
engage with China on the principles of mutual
trust and respect and sensitivity for each other’s
concerns.

1.21 India and Nepal share a unique

relationship of friendship and cooperation
characterized by open borders and deeprooted people-to-people contacts of kinship
and culture. As a close friend and neighbour,
India stands committed to support the people
and the Government of Nepal in consolidating
the peaceful democratic transition and in its
economic development efforts.

1.22 The traditional good relations between

India and Bangladesh have improved

significantly as both countries have taken
a number of measures to boost bilateral
cooperation. Extended economic engagement,
growing security cooperation between both
countries and the ongoing dialogue to settle

outstanding border issues will contribute

to the improvement of the regional security
scenario.


1.23 India-Myanmar relations are reinforced

by historical, cultural, ethnic and religious
ties. India continues to engage with Myanmar
on various fronts, including trade and
infrastructure and developmental cooperation
and cooperation in security matters is also
being enhanced. The Government of Myanmar
has reciprocated India’s gestures of goodwill
and friendship.

1.24 With the end of the civil war in Sri Lanka,

the security situation in the region as a whole
has improved considerably. India supports Sri
Lanka in finding a lasting political settlement
where all its citizens can live in peace. India
is already contributing substantially to the
rehabilitation of internally displaced persons
and the reconstruction efforts in Northern Sri
Lanka and stands ready to enhance bilateral
cooperation in a range of areas, including
defence and security.

1.25 India’s bilateral relationship with Bhutan

is based on mutual trust and understanding,
shared interests and mutual cooperation. India
has had extensive cooperation with Bhutan in
areas such as power, transport, communications
infrastructure, education, IT, industry, medicine

and agriculture. India remains committed to
assist the Royal Government of Bhutan in its
socio-economic development.

1.26 India and the Maldives have traditionally

enjoyed a warm and friendly relationship.
Regular contacts and exchanges at all levels

have kept the tempo of friendly relations

between both countries. India and Maldives
are cooperating closely in maritime matters,


-----

especially in view of increasing piracy related
incidents.

1.27 India’s maritime interests are evident,

considering our 7600 km long coast line and
an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of over
2.2 million sq km. These are accentuated
on account of our location, astride major
commercial routes and energy lifelines in the
Indian Ocean, namely, the Malacca Straits,
Six and Ten degree channel and the Persian
Gulf. Annually, US $200 billion worth of oil
passes through the Straits of Hormuz and US
$60 billion through the Malacca Strait.

1.28 The Indian Ocean, spread over an

area of 68.56 million square kilometres is,
thus, central to India’s maritime interests and


concerns. India’s economic development is
crucially dependent on the sea because of the
criticality of sea borne trade in an increasingly
inter-linked world, as well as because of the
potential of vast economic resources of the
oceans. By virtue of our geography, we are
therefore interested in the security of shipping
along the sea lanes of communications in the
Indian Ocean Region (IOR). India’s maritime
interest involve the safeguarding of our
coastline and island territories, as also our
interests in our EEZ, as well as in maintaining
open and secure Sea Lines of Communication
(SLOCs).

1.29 The increased incidence of piracy in

the IOR is an issue of serious concern. The
presence of Somali pirates in the waters around

has been an unwelcome
development which

requires heightened vigil.
The Indian Navy, which
has been given the overall
responsibility for maritime
security, is working in

coordination with the Coast
Guard and other Central
and State agencies to deal

with challenges of threats

in some Northeast states and
organized crime in some of
India’s major cities.

1.31 The continuation

of attempts at infiltration
into Jammu and Kashmir by
terrorists from Pakistan and
Pak occupied Kashmir (POK)
is a matter of concern and
is being effectively tackled
by the Security Forces. The
security situation in the
North-Eastern States has


from the sea. The Indian
Navy and Coast Guard have enhanced coastal
surveillance and patrolling and joint exercises
are also being regularly conducted with other
agencies to improve operational coordination.
India is also engaged in enhancing cooperative
interactions and exchanges with various other
countries in the IOR to tackle common security
challenges. The Indian Navy is working in
coordination with the Navies and coalition
forces of various countries in the Gulf of Aden.
India is in favour of strengthening multilateral
cooperation under a UN framework to meet
the complex challenges of maritime security.

###### INTERNAL SECURITY CHALLENGES

1.30 India has been facing multifaceted

internal security challenges which have
included left wing extremism, continued
engagements with Special Forces (SFs) by
subversive elements in Kashmir, insurgencies


improved during the current year. A number
of insurgent groups, including the ULFA,
have shown interest in abjuring violence and
are involved in talks with the Government.
However, given the external linkages of some
of the insurgent groups, it will be necessary
to remain alert and prepared to tackle any
possible increase in insurgent activity in the
region.

1.32 The dynamic regional and global

security environment present a wide spectrum
of challenges to India which must be faced
rapidly and effectively, in order to sustain and

support the growth and rise of the country and
the development of her people. Few countries of
the world face the range of security challenges
that India faces today. Nonetheless, the country
and our defence forces remain fully prepared

to tackle all eventualities.

##### INDIAN ARMY

Creating Barriers in Difficult Terrains


-----

### The Indian Army is committed to the defence of the
###### country from external and internal threats across the entire spectrum of warfare and the Army operations have significantly reduced the terrorist related incidents


###### SECURITY OVERVIEW

3.1 The ever changing global geo-political

dynamics presents the Nation to multiple

security challenges. The Indian Army (IA) is
committed to the defence of the country from
external and internal threats across the entire
spectrum of warfare. Additionally, aid to Civil
Authorities is provided in times of disaster/
natural calamities.

3.2 The Army continues to maintain strict

vigil while constantly reviewing its operational
preparedness/ postures to meet the perceived
security challenges.

###### JAMMU AND KASHMIR

3.3 The security situation in J&K has

stabilized. The Army’s persistent and proactive counter terrorist operations have
continued. This has manifested in a more
secure environment.

3.4 While Army operations have

significantly reduced the terrorist related
incidents and their residual strength, the
terrorist threat remains real as the terrorist
infrastructure across the borders remains


intact. Violent protests and civil unrest stoked
by anti- national elements and separatists,
with  active support from across the borders,
occurred during the June – September period.
Coordinated action by the Security forces, has
stabilised the security situation.

3.5 **Situation Along the Borders: The**

ceasefire on the borders is holding out with a
few aberrations. There have been 57 cases of
ceasefire violations along the borders during
the current year, as compared to 31 cases in
2009. The incidents of ceasefire violations
are being taken up through the established
mechanism of DGsMO talks and local level
flag meetings.

3.6 Strict vigil is being maintained along

the borders and counter infiltration measures
adopted by the Army have been further
strengthened. Infiltration attempts, however,
continue. In this period, 31 infiltration bids
have been foiled and 40 terrorists have been
killed in action.

3.7 **Situation in Hinterland: In 2010, the**

Army has killed 238 terrorists and apprehended
62, while suffering 52 casualties. The terrorist
leadership has successfully been targeted

and a total of 31 terrorist
leaders have been neutralised.
Incidents of terrorists related
violence remains low, due to
the operational ascendancy
achieved by the Army.

(NDFB), Dimasa Halam Doagah

(DHD) and United Peoples

Democratic Solidarity (UPDS)

are continuing. The anti-talk

faction of NDFB emerged as

the most violent group. The

operations against the group


3.8 The security situation in the North

Eastern States has improved due to the
consistent and co-ordinated efforts of Army
and the Government. The proactive Counter
Insurgency (CI) Operations in the region, being
undertaken by Army and other Central and
State Forces, has prompted a large number of
groups to seek peaceful negotiations.

3.9 **Assam: A large number of junior and**

middle level leaders of United Liberation Front
of Assam (ULFA), the largest under ground
(UG) group in the State, have been neutralized
in the ongoing Counter Insurgency (CI)
operations. Over 18 ULFA cadres have been
killed, 13 surrendered and 87 apprehended
by the Security forces since January 2010.
Six senior cadres, including Chairman, Mr.
Arabindo Rajkhowa, who were in jail; have
been released on bail to facilitate peace talks.
Mr. Paresh Baruah, the SS Commander in Chief
of the outfit remains elusive and his loyalists
continue extortion. There is popular support
for peace and pressure is mounting on ULFA
to initiate dialogue with the Government.

3.10 Suspension of Operations (SoO)

Agreements with other UG Groups like the
National Democratic Front of Bodoland


have resulted in death of its 68 cadres in 2010.

The group has declared unilateral ceasefire

with effect from December 30, 2010 for a

period of six months to initiate peace talks with

the Government.

3.11 In South Assam, surrender by cadres of

DHD (J) has ushered in peace. However, the

renaming of NC Hills District as Dima Hasao

has caused resentment amongst non-Dimasas.

The work on infrastructure projects, which was

hampered by ongoing violence has resumed,

although the progress is slow.

3.12 **Nagaland: Violence levels in the State**

have declined and also the Inter Factional

Clashes (IFCs) between the NSCN (IM) and

NSCN (K) have considerably reduced. The

reconciliation process spearheaded by Forum

for Naga Reconciliation (FNR), has gained

momentum as the populace of State longs

for peace. The Army and Assam Rifles (AR)

are keeping the UG groups under check and

ensuring adherence of Ceasefire Ground Rules

(CFGRs).

3.13 **Manipur: In the last few years Manipur**

has emerged as the most volatile State in North

East. However, the insurgency related activities

in 2010 have been on comparatively low ebb.


-----

Operations by the Army and Assam Rifles are

continuing. 70 cadres of various outfits have
been killed and over 668 apprehended by the
security forces since January 2010.

3.14 The Suspension of Operations (SoO)

with Kuki and Zomi UG Groups has ushered
peace in the Kuki and Zomi inhabited areas
and they have been impressed upon to adhere
to the SoO ground rules. The laying down of
arms by KCP (MC) Lalumba faction (first Meitei
UG Group to lay down arms) on August 6,
2010 can be termed as a watershed in Meitei
insurgency. The arrest of Mr. RK Meghen
Chairman UNLF in November 2010, has
inflicted a major setback to the group and can
severely weaken the outfit.

3.15 Year 2010 saw two major closures of

National Highways 39 and 53 by the front
organisations of Naga UG groups, which caused
great inconvenience to the local populace.
All efforts were made to ensure uninterrupted
supply of essentials to the State.  The protests
in the state are being funded by insurgent
groups who are using front organisations to
continuously fuel the agitation.

### The Indian Navy by virtue of its multidimensional
###### capability, strategic positioning and robust presence in the areas of interest has been a catalyst for peace, tranquility and stability in the Indian Ocean Region


4.1 The Indian Navy (IN) by virtue of

its multidimensional capability, strategic

positioning and robust presence in the areas of
interest has been a catalyst for peace, tranquility

and stability in the Indian Ocean Region(IOR).
During the year, the IN has engaged other
maritime nations to support national initiatives
of cooperation and engagement and our
fleets have sailed and exercised successfully
in the South China Sea and the African and
Mediterranean waters. These opportunities have
strengthened bilateral relationships, enhanced
inter-operability and helped in sharing best
practices from other navies. Such overseas
deployments also reassure our overseas Indian
population.  To achieve its mandated tasks,
the Indian Navy is enhancing its capabilities,

cooperation and inter-operability with regional
and extra-regional navies.

4.2 The Indian Navy has always responded

swiftly and efficiently to the various challenges,
be it in safeguarding our frontiers or sea trade.
These include combating piracy and terrorism
at sea, conducting hydrographic surveys in IOR
and in the waters of friendly foreign countries,
coordinating navigational warnings over vast

oceanic and littoral areas and providing Search
and Rescue facilities to those in distress. Our


proactive response and professional handling

of situations has encouraged a number of

countries of the IOR in seeking our assistance

and advice to counter maritime challenges

in their respective Exclusive Economic Zones

(EEZs). We continue to support and augment

the efforts towards capacity building and

surveillance, thereby enhancing overall

maritime capabilities in the Indian Ocean

Region.

4.3 Creation of capability and modernisation

of the force is being pursued with vigour, based

upon the threat perceptions, prevailing external

strategic security environment and emerging

technologies. The Indian Navy remains deeply

committed to the process of indigenisation by

inducting capabilities both from the public

and private sector. A total of 36 ships and

submarines are presently on order in Indian

and overseas yards.

##### INDIAN AIR FORCE

Indian Air Force transforming towards Network Centric Capabilities


-----

### Air power, due to its inherent nature, possesses
###### immense potential for coercive strategy and IAF, today, is well established on the path of becoming a lethal aerospace force, ready to face the dynamic technological global challenges through modernization and able leadership


5.1 The world at large faces enormous

strategic uncertainties; and India is not outside

its influence. Since 1999, IAF has been

involved in various strategic roles ranging

from air maintenance to disaster relief, support

to UN peace keeping efforts and international

co-operation. The IAF has been a very active

component of the nearly 9000 air warriors in

various UN Peace keeping force across the

world. It is also engaged in a number of air

exercises with friendly countries to hone its

strategic capabilities in a global environment.

Military technological growth poses new

challenges and provides unique opportunities

to leverage new and current military capabilities

in pursuit of national interests. Air power, due

to its inherent nature, possesses immense

potential for coercive strategy. IAF today is

well established on the path of becoming

a lethal aerospace force, ready to face the

dynamic technological global challenges

through modernization and able leadership.

Due to its inherent characteristics of mobility

and responsiveness, IAF is amongst the first

elements to respond to any disaster relief and

humanitarian assistance.


###### OPERATIONS 

5.2 **Transforming** **towards** **Network**

**Centric Capabilities: IAF, under the ambit of**
C4ISR (Command, Control, Communication,
Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance and
Reconnaissance), is enhancing its network
centric capabilities, that generate combat power
by networking - sensors, decision makers and
weapon systems - to achieve shared awareness,
increased efficacy of command structure,
higher tempo of operations and greater lethality.
Implementing Operational Data Link is the key
component towards achieving network centric
capabilities. The project envisages networking
of airborne platforms, ground sensors and

Command and Control Centres, to reduce
the sensor-to-shooter time, in a time sensitive
targeting scenario. IAF has also significantly
enhanced its force projection capabilities in
emergent situations, both in Offensive and
Defensive operations with the induction of
three Airborne Warning and Control System
(AWACS) aircraft. The institutionalisation of
IACCS, the mother board of all Network Centric
Operation, has primarily led to automating all

Air Defence (AD) functions of the IAF towards


-----

control over all weapon systems from a
centralized location.

5.3 **IAF Transport and Helicopter Support**

**Operations: Assistance to civil agencies during**
natural calamities and disasters is a vital
function of the transport and helicopter fleet
of Indian Air Force and these roles have been
performed by it commendably over the years.

##### DEFENCE PRODUCTION

Launching of Missile Destroyer Chennai


-----

### Over the years, the Department of Defence
###### Production has established wide ranging production facilities for various defence equipment through the Ordnance Factories and Defence PSUs


7.1 The Department of Defence Production

was set up in November 1962 with the objective
of developing a comprehensive production
infrastructure for the defence of the nation.

Over the years, the Department has established
wide ranging production facilities for various
defence equipment through the Ordnance
Factories and Defence PSUs. The products
manufactured include arms and ammunition,
tanks, armoured vehicles, heavy vehicles,
fighter aircraft and helicopters, warships,
submarines, missiles, ammunition, electronic
equipment, earth moving equipment, special
alloys and special purpose steels.

7.2 The following are the main organizations

under the Department of Defence Production:

¾¾ Ordnance Factory Board (OFB)

¾¾ Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL)

¾¾ Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL)

¾¾ Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers

Limited (GRSE)

¾¾ Goa Shipyard Limited (GSL)

¾¾ Hindustan Shipyard Limited (HSL)

¾¾ Mazagon Dock Limited (MDL)

¾¾ BEML Limited (BEML)

¾¾ Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL)


¾¾ Mishra Dhatu Nigam Limited

(MIDHANI)

¾¾ Directorate General of Quality

Assurance (DGQA)

¾¾ Directorate General of Aeronautical

Quality Assurance (DGAQA)

¾¾ Directorate of Standardisation (DOS)

¾¾ Directorate of Planning & Coordination

(Dte. of P&C)

¾¾ Defence Exhibition Organisation

(DEO)

7.3 Of the above, Hindustan Shipyard

Limited was transferred from the Ministry of

Shipping to the Ministry of Defence during

2009-10 for strengthening the naval defence

capabilities for manufacture of warships and

submarines.

7.4 With the objective of achieving self
reliance in defence production, the Ordnance

Factories and Defence PSUs have been

continuously modernizing and upgrading their

capabilities and widening their product range.

They have also developed a large number

of major products on their own, apart from

developing the capabilities in various fields

through transfer of technology.


-----

7.5 The production and turnover of

Ordnance Factories and Defence PSUs have
been increasing steadily, in response to the
increasing requirements of armed forces as well
as the nation’s security and strategic concerns.
Details of turnover for the last three years are
given below:

**YEAR** **TOTAL SALES** **TOTAL SALES** **GRAND**

**ORDNANCE** **PUBLIC SECTOR** **TOTAL**

**FACTORIES** **UNDERTAKINGS** **(Rs. in Cr.)**

2007-08 6937.81 16740.25 23678.06

2008-09 7229.31 20403.64 27632.95

2009-10 8715.26 25899.64 34614.90

2010-11 11208.00 27407.00 38615.00

(BE)

7.6 For achieving self-reliance in defence

production, it is also essential to develop a wide
production base in the private sector, apart
from developing the public sector industries.
Defence PSUs and Ordnance Factories
have, as a policy, been outsourcing many of
their requirements and have, over the years,
developed a wide vendor base which includes
a large number of medium and small scale
enterprises, apart from large scale industries.

7.7 In May 2001, the Government of

India had decided to allow private sector
participation in defence industry which was
till then reserved for the public sector. Under
the guidelines issued by the Department of
Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), 100%
investment by private sector is allowed in the
sector and foreign direct investment upto 26%
is allowed, subject to licensing.

7.8 Applications for licensing are

considered by a Standing Committee in the


Department of Defence Production and
appropriate recommendations are given to the
DIPP.  DIPP has so far issued 155 Letters of
Intent (LOI) to different Indian companies for
setting up defence industrial units. A number of
joint ventures have also been formed between
Indian and foreign companies.

7.9 In 2006, the Ministry of Defence

had made a major change in the Defence
Procurement Procedure, under which offsets
have been provided for in respect of all
contracts of Rs. 300 Cr.s or more. Specified
goods or services worth 30% of the value
of such contracts, have to be procured by
supplies from Indian industry. Since a large
number of major procurements are on the anvil
in connection with the modernization of the
armed forces, the Indian defence industry will
have several opportunities for participation in
offset contracts.

7.10 The Government has recently brought

out a Defence Production Policy with the
following objectives:
(i) To achieve substantive self reliance
in the design, development and

production of equipment/ weapon
systems/ platforms required for defence
in as early a time frame as possible;

(ii) To create conditions conducive for the
private industry to take an active role in
this endeavour; and

(iii) To enhance the potential of SMEs in
indigenization and to broaden the
defence R&D base of the country.

|YEAR|TOTAL SALES ORDNANCE FACTORIES|TOTAL SALES PUBLIC SECTOR UNDERTAKINGS|GRAND TOTAL (Rs. in Cr.)|
|---|---|---|---|
|2007-08|6937.81|16740.25|23678.06|
|2008-09|7229.31|20403.64|27632.95|

|2010-11|11208.00 (BE)|27407.00|38615.00|


-----

7.11 To achieve the above objectives, it

has been decided that preference will be
given to indigenous design, development and
manufacture. For building a robust defence
industrial base, it has been decided to encourage
larger involvement of the Indian private sector
industry in the design and development of
defence equipment. In order to synergize and
enhance the national capabilities in producing
state-of-the-art Defence equipment; formation
of consortia, joint ventures and public private
partnerships etc. will be encouraged. The
Academia, Research and Development

Institutions as well as Technical and Scientific
Organizations will also be involved in the
process.

**_Deoxy-D-Glucose (2DG) : The safety and_**

efficacy of 2-Deoxyglucose (2-DG) as the

optimal radiosensitizer through cell lines,

animal and human trials has been established.

The glucose anti-metabolite, 2-deoxy-D
glucose (2-DG), is a glycolytic inhibitor that

significantly depletes the energy in cancer

cells, thereby compromising their ability to

repair the damage and resist therapy. This

results in a selective increase in damage

caused by radiation and chemotherapeutic

drugs in tumors, while reducing the same in

normal tissues. It has been found clinically

useful in recurrent neuroblastoma, one of the

most radioresistant tumor with practically no

chances of survival. Phase – III clinical trials

have been successfully completed and DCGI

clearance is awaited for launch in the market.


**_Integrated Life Support System (ILSS) – On_**
**_Board Oxygen Generation System (OBOGS) :_**

It has been designed and developed to
administer required quantities of oxygen at
various altitudes to pilots of fighter aircraft on
long endurance missions thus eliminating the
burden of re-charging the oxygen cylinders.
The system provides 95-96% oxygen to pilots
in case of ejection from the fighter aircraft,
protects the pilots from losing consciousness
due to acceleration forces (G forces) and also
gives a combat edge to the pilot by enhanced
endurance. After technology demonstration,
airworthy units are under fabrication for further
trials for integration in LCA (Tejas).

**_Permafrost : A Permafrost germplasm and_**
vegetable storage facility has been established
in Ladakh to serve as a safety net for food
security in an era of global warming and climate
change. Permafrost Storage would be a national
facility which will preserve germplasm at -4
to -20 degree Celsius temperature inside the
structure with 10-20 per cent moisture. This
seed storage facility would allow the survival
of valuable living seeds for long term which is
an economically viable possibility that allows
germplasm preservation of valuable and
endangered plants.

**_Biodigester : It has been developed for_**
human night soil degradation through

microbial reaction converting it into biogas
in a cylindrical structure of mild steel or
fibre reinforced plastic. The biodigesters are
being used in Army transit camps, Siachen
glaciers, Partapur and other high altitude cold
regions, being further developed for use in


-----

railway coaches, tourist buses and are under
installation in Lakshadweep islands and other
plain areas. Technology has been transferred
to industry. This is an eco-friendly technology
for disposal of human waste at glacier, other
low temperature areas and soil bound cold
regions, etc.

**_Attracticide : An “attracticide” for control_**
of Dengu and Chikungunya vector mosquito
(Aedes Egypti) population has been developed
containing a mosquito egg laying attractant
pheromone and an insect growth regulator to
lure the mosquitoes for enhanced egg laying
and then to kill the mosquitoes by arresting
their development from larvae to adult forms.
The technology has been transferred for
productionisation after successful trials.

**_Combat Free Fall Oxygen System : A system_**
with protective clothing and equipment has
been developed to meet the high altitude
paratrooper’s mission requirements of

providing oxygen on demand during breathing
for 30-40 minutes after bailout and 60 minutes
of supply for pre-breathing on board the aircraft
for 6 personnel. It protects the paratrooper


during free fall from 30,000 ft against adverse

conditions.

8.17 **Right To Information (RTI) Act:** The

RTI Act – 2005 was introduced to promote

transparency and accountability in the working

of public authorities. This enabled the citizens

of India to access information under control

of the authorities. DRDO has been placed in

the second schedule of the RTI Act – 2005

exempting it from the application of the general

provisions of the Act except for the issues

of Human Rights violation and corruption.

Accordingly, DRDO has evolved the following

system to promote the flow of information. The

organization has appointed Public Information

Officers (PIOs) in each of its laboratories/

establishments to deal with the cases of the

RTI. DRDO HQrs also has a PIO and a Chief

Public Information Officer (CPIO). Guidelines

on the RTI Act, as applicable to DRDO, have

been evolved by the Organization which act

as reference document for all the PIOs of

the organization. The Organization has also

launched a RTI specific website namely www.

11.36 **Recent** **Initiatives** **taken** **by** **the**

**Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare:**

(i) Providing computer hardware to all

Rajya Sainik Boards and  Zila Sainik

Boards that were hitherto not provided

with the same, (21 out of 32 RSBs

and 184 out of 361 ZSBs were thus

additionally provided for).

(ii) Initiating a project for Computerized

Grievances Redressal for the Department

through National Informatic Centre

Services Inc. (NICSI).

(iii) Entering into a contract with the

Consultant identified by Consultancy

Development Centre under the Ministry

of Science and Technology to develop

IT- based solutions for the Department.

(iv) The present pattern of sharing

expenditure between the Centre and

the States for running of Rajya Sainik

Boards and Zila Sainik Boards is 50:50.

This was decided upon in 1962 and for

various reasons required a change. The

Ministry of Defence has now decided

to enhance the Central share to 75% in

respect of special category States and

60% for other States.


(v) Signing of an MoU with Doordarshan
to have a multi dimensional programme
produced for Ex-Servicemen to place in
perspective the positive role played by
them in nation building.

(vi) Funds from Armed Forces Flag Day Fund
(AFFDF) are spent on duly considered
and approved welfare schemes for ExServicemen and their families/ wards.
While the provisions enable the corpus
to be increased from various sources,
this has not met with much success
earlier. It has now been decided with
the approval of competent authority
that from the current financial year,
the 3 Services will make a regular total
annual contribution of Rs.10 Cr.s, to
be proportionately shared by them in
accordance with the strength of their
personnel.

(vii) Exemption has been granted on January
4, 2011 to the donations received
towards Armed Forces Flag Day Fund
(AFDF) under Section 80G(5)(iv) of the
Income Tax Act, 1961. This exemption
is valid for the period from assessment

year 2011-12 onwards. This is
expected to boost the corpus of AFFDF,
used for various welfare programmes
for Ex-Servicemen and their families/
dependents.

(viii) An initiative was taken to take joint

action together with the Department

of Financial Services to ensure pension
disbursement to Ex-Servicemen in


-----

respect of the 6th CPC recommendations,
with the help of the print media.

(ix) In order to enable Defence pensioners
to know their correct entitlement as a
result of various Government orders,
the Controller General of Defence
Accounts (CGDA) has developed a
software called ‘Suvigya’. With some


basic inputs, this software facilitates
calculation/ computation of pension.
The Department of Ex-Servicemen
Welfare has, together with CGDA, taken
the initiative of having the software
installed at all RSBs/ ZSBs and training
the concerned officers, in order that the
facility is available at a decentralized
level.

_Appendix-III_

###### SUMMARY OF LATEST COMPTROLLER & AUDITOR GENERAL (C&AG) REPORT
 ON THE WORKING OF MINISTRY OF DEFENCE

**Report No. 12 of 2010-11: Union Government**

**(Defence Services) Army and Ordnance Factories**


###### II Ministry of Defence

**Para 2.1: Defective Import of SMERCH**

**Multi Barrel Rocket Launcher**
**System**

Forty two numbers of ‘SMERCH’ Multi Barrel
Rocket Launcher System were procured between
July 2007 and May 2009 from a Russian Firm at
a total cost of Rs 2633 Cr.. The exploitation of
the weapon conducted in October/November
2008 by a Rocket Regiment revealed critical
defects in its various sub-systems. Besides, the
Buyer Furnished Equipments (BFE) required to
operationalise the SMERCH weapon system
could not yet (November 2009) be procured in
the absence of approval of War Establishment
(WE) of the units. Thus, the SMERCH weapon
system procured at a cost of Rs. 2633 Cr.
proved defects prone and could not be fully
operationalised for one to three years.

**Para 2.2: Procurement of low capability**

**missiles**

The Ministry procured outdated Anti Tank
Guided Missiles (ATGM) of 1970s vintage
valuing Rs. 587.02 Cr. in 2008 from M/s Bharat
Dynamics Ltd. (BDL) by compromising the
Army’s requirement. The Army wanted ATGM


of guided range as 2000 meters to meet the
need of modernization of forces and to avoid
risk of exposure. The ATGM having guided
range of 1850 meters were procured from
BDL, which were not only unable to achieve
desired range but also did not meet the Army’s
objective of acquiring third generation missiles
already available in global market.

**Para 2.3: Non-replacement/ rectification of**

**imported ammunition**

The ammunition ‘A’ was designed to be fired
from T-72 Tanks. Indigenous and imported
ammunition valuing Rs. 273.75 Cr. reported
defective was awaiting repairs for over five to
eight years. Although the imported ammunition
was under warranty and the seller was
contractually bound to either replace or rectify
the defects free of charge, Army HQ did not
make efforts to get it rectified/ replaced from
the supplier. Delay in making the ammunition
fit for use is inexplicable.

###### III Army

**Para 3.1: Non-inclusion** **of** **Pre-Despatch**

**Inspection**

Pre-despatch inspection (PDI) by the Directorate
General of Quality Assurance or ultimate


-----

consignee in the contract for spares valuing
more than Rs. 3 Cr. was made mandatory
by the Army HQ to ensure receipt of correct
spares of prescribed quality. Violating their
own instructions, Army HQ concluded a
contract in May 2007 with a foreign firm for
procurement of spares for L-70 Guns without
incorporating the PDI Clause. Receipt of stores
without PDI had resulted in import of noncompatible spares worth Rs. 4.99 Cr., which
were neither repaired nor replaced by the firm
for two years.

**Para 3.3: Irregular procurement of short life**

**drug**

Simultaneous procurement of a drug, (Injection
Anti Lymphocyto Globulin ALG) centrally by
the DGAFMS and locally by the Commandant
AFMSD Delhi Cantonment resulted in its over
stocking. Consequently, 2121 vials costing Rs.
2.13 Cr. remained unconsumed during shelf
life. Besides, 1078 vials valuing Rs. 1.08 Cr.
were procured locally by the Commandant
AFMSD violating the spirit of delegated
financial powers.

Thus, there was no coordination between
the DGAFMS and the Commandant AFMSD
Delhi Cantonment with regard to purchase of
medicines.

###### IV Works and Military Engineer Services

**Para 4.1: Irregular sanction and construction**

**of accommodation for a Golf Club**

Inspite of highlighting misuse of financial
powers by the General-Officer-Commanding

in-Chief, Western Command for purchase of

golf carts and unauthorised use of Defence

land by a Golf Course without payment of rent

in the earlier Audit Report, Commanders of a

Corps HQ and an Independent Sub Area got

constructed unauthorised new accommodation

for a Golf Club at Ambala Cantonment under the

guise of special repairs to existing buildings.

**Para 4.2: Avoidable extra liability due to**

**delay in revision of administrative**

**sanction**

Delay and lack of diligence both in Engineering

wing in the QMG branch at Army Headquarters

and Ministry of Defence in revision of

administrative approval resulted in avoidable

extra liability of Rs. 2.95 Cr. due to cost

escalation. There was no system in place to

ensure that the Approximate Estimates (AE) was

based on the new standard schedule of rates

(SSR) and to monitor the timely preparation

and approval of the revised AE.

###### V Border Roads Organisation

**Para 5.1: Hasty procurement of segregators**

Director General Border Roads procured six

segregators for Rs. 4.55 Cr. without conducting

economic feasibility study, ensuring availability

of natural aggregates and making available

site after obtaining clearance from Forest

Department and Pollution Control Board which

resulted in wasteful expenditure without any

gainful use.


-----

**Para 5.2: Misappropriation of Government**

**stores**

Non-verification of credentials including

financial status, business ethics, market

standing of contractor before awarding contract

and the absence of co-ordination between

different Project authorities of BRO, resulted

in misappropriation of bitumen worth Rs. 1.67

Cr. intended for transportation to BRO units

under two separate contracts.

###### VI Defence Research and Development Organsiation

**Para 6.1: Injudicious creation of assets**

Defence Research and Development

Organisation (DRDO) incurred an expenditure

of Rs. 8.92 Cr. on establishing a sub station

to draw power from a State Power Supply

Corporation without assessing the Corporations

ability to supply stable and uninterrupted

power for operation of highly sensitive

equipments. After commissioning of power

supply, the imported equipments procured for

R&D activities did not function properly due to

variation in voltage with frequent interruption

in power supply. As a result, DRDO had to

procure DG Sets for Rs. 3.57 Cr. for operation

of equipments. As such the expenditure of

Rs. 8.92 Cr. incurred on establishing a sub

station to support the 66 KV line was rendered

infructuous.

**Departmental View and Present Status :**

DRDO agree with the observation that the

66kVA electrical sub-station at the cost of Rs.


8.92 Cr. was built at Kolar. Due to erratic &
poor quality ‘power supply’ by M/s KPTCL,
power supply from this power station was not
useful. Separate DG sets were purchased to
use as source of power supply to K1 & K3 sites.
As the quality of power received at substation
was poor, not meeting the standards, the
utilization of power was reduced and the 66
kV sub-station was not useful to its full extent.
Presently sub-station is used to supply power
to K2 residential area, street lighting and for all

civilian application. Action Taken Note (ATN)

has been forwarded to Audit on 20 Oct 2010
for vetting.

**Para 6.2: Loss due to damage to imported**

**equipment**

DRDO suffered a loss of Rs. 6.91 Cr. on account
of damage to the imported equipment due to
mishandling by the consolidation agent. The
amount of loss could not be recovered from
the consolidation agent for over two years
and claim has also been raised against the
transporting agency.

**Departmental View and Present Status:**

DRDO partially agree with the facts

included in the paragraphs. The designated
Air Consolidation Agent (ACA) for DRDO
subcontracts the work to outside agencies for
delivery of the consignment to the customer
site. This results in subcontractor handling the
delicate and sensitive consignments without
prior experience to handle such equipments

and without proper tools required for such

consignments. Negotiation for the settlement
of insurance claim has already been carried


-----

out with the ACA and Rs. 2.50 Cr.s has to be
recovered from him. The insurance company
has assessed Rs. 20 lakhs as the salvage value

of the damaged equipment. The receipt of the

settlement amount payment is awaited.  Action

Taken Note (ATN) on the Audit Para is in the

process of approval by competent authority for

submission to Audit.

**Para 6.3: Avoidable expenditure due to poor**

**planning of a work service**

Poor planning of a work service by the

Programme Director and Chief Construction

Engineer, led to an additional expenditure of

Rs. 1.39 Cr. towards payment of compensation

to the contractor.

**Departmental View and Present Status : DRDO**

partially agree with the audit conclusions that

there was poor planning of the work services

by PD, System Test & Integration Rig(STIR) or

CCE(R&D) or their offices and that there was

failure on their part in the shifting of the 66kV

HT line. Ample evidence has been submitted

which proves beyond doubt that immediate

and quick actions were taken to ensure timely

execution of the task by both their offices. This

being a multi-departmental activity, including

the Karnataka State Electricity Board, NAL &

HAL which are not under the control of DRDO.

Added to this, the technical difficulties of the

project due to the soil condition made the

proposal to change from Under Ground (UG)

to Over Head (OH), etc, resulted in the delay

in the execution of the project. It may also be

noted that payment was for cost-escalation of


the raw materials and not for the compensation.
Action Taken Note (ATN) has been forwarded
to Audit on December 9, 2010 for vetting.

**Para 6.4 Loss due to lack of coordination in**

**procurement of a life saving item**

An expenditure of Rs. 93.09 lakh incurred on
procurement of drugs proved infructuous as
the drugs could not be issued to users within
their shelf life. Although the life saving item
was accepted in September 2004 for use in
the Army, it remained undistributed for nearly
five years predominantly due to the lack of
coordination between the developer and the
user.

**Departmental View and Present Status :**

DRDO partially agree with the facts included
in the paragraphs. A sum of Rs. 93.09 lakh
spent on production of drug cartridges of
Atropine Sulphate and PAM Chloride should
not be taken as loss. The issue of drug being
not used due to non availability of shelf life
is not correct since there was some shelf life
available in July 2006 during the issue of drug
to the Army though not the stipulated 75%
and besides the drug was available with DRDE
Gwalior before issue to the Army, for in case
of emergency i.e. nerve agents attack. Also
the replaced drug was not rejected by DGQA
as the same was referred to DGAFMS who
cleared the drug since the observation was of
minor nature. Subsequently Army, DGQA and
DRDO jointly inspected the AJIs in September

2009 and it was passed for use. Action Taken

Note (ATN) has been forwarded to Audit on
October 20, 2010 for vetting.


-----

###### VII Ordnance Factory Organisation

**Para 7.2: Injudicious sanction of Ordnance**

**Factory Korwa Project**

The project for establishment of a new

ordnance factory at Korwa, Amethi at an

estimated investment of Rs. 408.01 Cr. by

October 2010 to meet an operationally

urgent need for acquisition of new generation

carbines was sanctioned without finalization

of new generation carbines to be produced

in the factory. This coupled with selection of

inappropriate site and inadequate monitoring

resulted in slow progress of the project. The

project is likely to be delayed very badly,

thereby delaying the supply of urgently required

carbines to the Army.

**Para 7.10: Suspected fraud in reimbursement**

**of Customs duty to suppliers**

Two private firms got “reimbursement” of

Customs Duty of Rs. 1.19 Cr. from Ordnance

Equipment Factory Kanpur for supply of

machines, by producing documents, suspected

to be forged to claim the re-imbursement.

Audit examination revealed that the one firm

did not pay Customs Duty and another firm

undervalued the cost of machines to pay lower

rate to the Customs and managed to obtain

reimbursement of higher rate of Customs Duty

from the factory.

**Brief on the Performance Audit Report on**

**Supply Chain Management of Rations in**

**Indian Army**


**(C&AG of India’s Report No. 6 of 2010-11)**

The performance Audit was carried out in the

Ministry of Defence, Northern, Eastern, and

Western Commands of the Army which are

operationally active and where the supply

chain mechanism are more complex because

of terrain conditions and dispersal of troops.

The documents were examined at Supplies

and Transport Branch of the Commands and

selected Corps Headquarters, Supply Depots

and ASC Battalions in those Commands. At

the Central level, records were examined at

the Director General, Supplies and Transport,

Army Procurement Organisation and the

Ministry.

###### Dry Rations:

Annual Provisioning is carried out on normative

basis rather than on real data. Lack of reliable

data on actual opening stock balance and

feeding strength created significant risks of

loss and wastage in the supply chain of dry

rations.

Except for Sugar and Jam, in all other items,

there were significant under procurements. In

fact, in most of the cases, the actual quantity

procured was so much at variance with the

provisioned quantity that the whole exercise

of the provisioning was rendered largely

infructuous. While only in the case of Dal and

Tea, the shortage were made up to some extent

through local procurement by the Depots, in

other items the significant shortages were never

made up.


-----

In case of Sugar, there was excess procurement

over and above the provisioned requirement

for two years. During 2006-07, 11944 MT

of Sugar was procured in excess of the

provisioned quantity i.e. an excess of 25% over

the requirement. In case of Tea and Dal, there

was consistent shortfall in procurement in all

the three years. In 2005-06, there was shortfall

of 22,615 MT (48%) in central procurement

of Dal and even after local procurement there

was a shortfall of 33%. Even during 2006-07

and 2007-08 there was a shortfall of 11% and

25% respectively.

###### Food items issued after the expiry of estimated storage life

Estimated storage Life (ESL) of a food item is

the period for which the food item is likely

to remain fit for human consumption, under

normal storage conditions. According to

the DGST technical instructions the Supply

Depots are to ensure that food items are issued

in accordance with their storage life (ESL). In

special circumstances, ESL may be extended to

a maximum of three months.

Audit found that out of the 11,346 samples

of rations sent to the three Central Food

Laboratories for extension of ESL, extension

was granted in respect of 11,330 cases. Thus,

almost in all the cases, extension was granted.

It was noticed that the CFLs (Composite Food

Laboratories) in Mumbai and Delhi adhered to

the DGST instructions, of not extending the life

of rations beyond three month of expiry of the

prescribed ESL. However, CFL, Jammu which


covers the whole of Northern Command and

some parts of Western Command granted

extensions well beyond three months of the

prescribed ESL, in some cases even upto 28

months. It was found that Atta, Sugar, Rice,

Tea, Dal, Edible Oil and raisins were consumed
even six to 28 months after the expiry of their
normal ESL.

###### Fresh Rations:

Serious absence of competition was noticed

in procurement of fresh rations. In three

Commands, among the cases checked in

Audit, 82% of the procurement was based on

less than three quotations. 36% was based on

single quotations.

In all three years, in Delhi only one vendor

viz. Mohd Iqbal & Company purchased the

tender documents for the supply of meat and

chicken and the contract was awarded to

them. Similarly, in Chandimandir, only two

vendors responded for meat and chicken

during tendering in 2005-06. The contract was

awarded to M/s Moneesh & Company. In the

next two years only M/s Moneesh & Company

responded and bagged the contracts with

annual orders value of Rs. 2.34 Cr..

During Audit, it was noticed that in all cases

of fresh rations, the accepted rates were way

below the Average Local Market Rates (ALMR)

determined by the Army authorities. In fact,

the Reasonable Rates determined by the same

authorities were much below the level of

ALMR, which rendered it grossly unrealistic.

Some of low rates: Orange at Rs. 11 per kg in


-----

2007-08; Mausambi Rs. 12 per Kg (In Delhi),

Orange and Mausambi at Rs. 1-2.11per Kg

in Binagudi and Bengdubi; Capsicum at Rs.

5.50 per Kg. Significant difference was noticed

between the contracted rates for Supply

Depot, where supplies were meant for soldiers

and Base Hospital Delhi where supplies were
meant for patients, even though specifications
were same on paper.

Unusual and inexplicable variations in prices
in adjacent locations were also noticed. Broiler
dressed in Amritsar was contracted at Rs. 47
per Kg in 2006-07 but in Ludhiana it was Rs.
62 per Kg. In Kolkata, meat dressed was Rs.
108 per Kg but in Dumdum which is close by,
the price was Rs. 69 in 2007-08.

Audit also found that the quantities received
by the consuming units were different from
what was shown to have been issued to the
units by the Supply Depots. Certain varieties of
vegetables shown to have been issued by the
Supply Depot and received by the consuming
units were not even procured by the Supply
Depots on those particular days.

In the Northern Command alone, Rs. 1.92 Cr.
worth of rations remained untraceable as of
March 31, 2008. Of this, Rs. 1.20 Cr. worth of
rations was issued during 2005-06, the receipt
of which was yet to be traced.

An analysis of the feedback reports received
from the units indicated that in 68% of such
reports the quantity of rations was graded as
satisfactory and below, in 31% the grading
was good and in only one percent the grading
was excellent.


**Brief on the Performance Audit Report on**
**Canteen Stores Department**

**(C&AG of India’s Report No. 14 of 2010-11)**

The Canteen Stores Department (CSD) is
responsible for providing the service personnel
and their families with household goods at rates
cheaper than the market rates. The operations
of CSD are carried out from its Head Office
in Mumbai and 5 Regional Offices. The CSD
through its chain of one Base Depot in Mumbai
and 34 Area Depots services as the wholesaler.
The retail operations through which the stores
reach to the Service personnel and their
families are carried out through the Unit Run
Canteens (URCs), which are under the control
of the local Armed Force authorities.

The rules for setting up of the URCs and their
day-to-day management are laid down by the
Ministry of Defence and Army Headquarters.
CSD transfer money from Consolidated Fund
of India (CFI) to URCs in the form of ‘Soft
Loans’ at the subsidized rate of interest of
4.5% to 6.5% per annum towards setting up
of these URCs and to keep sufficient inventory
and quantitative discount which tantamount to
distribution of stores free of cost to the URCs.

**Transfer** **to** **Non-Public** **Fund** **through**

**Quantitative Discount (QD)**

CSD provides quantitative discount in the form
of free stores to all the URCs. It was noticed
in Audit that the benefit of such QD was not
passed on to the customers and added to

the profits of the URCs. The incentive in the


-----

form of QD, therefore, could not be viewed
as ‘Trade Discount’ as reflected in the CSD
Proforma Accounts. It was in fact, transfer from
Consolidated Fund of India (CFI) to Non-Public
Fund without conforming to the provisions of
GFRs. During the last six years from 200203 to 2007-08 Rs. 883.46 Cr. was transferred

in the form of QD. Such transfer in the form

of ‘Trade Discount’ also affected adversely

the profitability of the CSD and resultantly,

Government revenues.

**Denial of access to the records of URCs**

Despite such assistance through CSD from CFI

and being the interface between the CSD and

the consumers, the URCs continue to remain

outside the purview of the Parliamentary

financial oversight, as they are considered to

be regimental institution. Neither the Budget

documents nor the proforma accounts of CSD

reflect the operations of the URCs. URCs are

also not subject to the accountability regime

for operations funded by the CFI.

Audit was denied access to the records of the

URCs by the Army Headquarters in spite of

repeated request. Even taking up the matter

at the highest level in the Ministry of Defence

could not ensure access of the Audit to the

URCs.

**Amount of Rs. 539 Cr. under Grants-in-Aid**

**transferred to the Non-Public Fund**

Ministry of Defence had been reflecting

approximately 50% of the profit of the CSD in

Demand for Grants as ‘Contribution’ (earlier


these amounts were being reflected as Grants
in-Aid) and disbursing them to the Services and

other bodies as Grants-in-Aid. These grants

were mostly transferred to the Non-Public

Funds maintained by the Services. During

2002-03 to 2008-09, a sum of Rs. 601.88 Cr.

was appropriated in this manner from the CFI.

Out of this, Rs. 63.05 Cr. was distributed to the

various beneficiaries. The balance amount of

Rs. 538.83 Cr. was shared by Services, which

were transferred to the Non-Public Fund.

Such Non-Public Fund, commonly known as

‘Regimental Funds’ are maintained by Armed

Forces authorities.

**Creation of new expenditure head without**

**consulting the C&AG of India**

In 2005-06 Ministry of Defence created a

new object head “Contribution” to disburse

these profits. The new accounting practice

further diluted the financial controls, as under

the General Financial Rules the utilization

certificates could be insisted only for Grants
in-Aid. A significant change like this in the

accounting of the financial transaction was

made without any consultation with the C&AG

of India as was required under the Constitution

of India. This change in the accounting treatment

took away the audit jurisdiction of the C&AG

over utilization of these disbursements by the

recipients. On being pointed out in Audit, the

Board of Control, Canteen Services (BOCCS)

in 2010 replied that the requisite utilization

certificates were obtained before sanction of

the Grants-in-Aid for the next year.


-----

**Incorrect application of pricing policy in**

**several cases**

During audit, several cases of incorrect

application of pricing policies were noticed.

While in some cases CSD made undue profit

at the cost of URCs and in turn of the customer,

there were cases where CSD also incurred
losses. Of particular significance was erratic
implementation of provisions of Value Added
Tax (VAT).

**Excess drawal of liquor**

Evidence in audit indicated that several units
under jurisdiction of five Area Depots were
drawing liquor in excess of that authorized on
the basis of the strength of the unit. CSD and
the Army authorities allowed excess drawal
of concessional liquor worth Rs. 7.82 Cr..
The market value of the excess liquor was Rs.
19.45 Cr..

**Inability of Area Depots to supply all the items**
**indented by the URCs**

It was seen in audit that most of the Area Depots
were not supplying the full range of items to the
URCs under their jurisdiction. The inability of
the Area Depot in issuing the item as demanded
by the URC is termed as “Denial”. In nine Area
Depots, during 2004-05 to 2008-09, denials
ranged from 4.48 per cent to 33.21 per cent.
The denials were particularly severe in Kirkee,
Delhi, Jaipur, Dehradun and Bangalore areas.

###### Defence Services (Air Force & Navy)

**_Summary of Important observations by C&AG_**

**_of India_**


**Report No. 16 of 2010-11 (Air Force and**
**Navy)**

**I** **Inordinate delay in fruition of Kaveri**
**engine**

Nearly two decades after the commencement
of the programme and 13 years after the
original probable date of completion with
an expenditure of Rs. 1892 Cr., Gas Turbine
Research Establishment (GTRE) is yet to fully
develop an aero-engine which meets the
specific needs of the Light Combat Aircraft. The
fate of the Kaveri project is highly uncertain
as GTRE is now considering a proposal of codevelopment and co-production dependent
upon a Joint Venture with a foreign vendor.

**_(Paragraph 5.1)_**

**Departmental View and Present Status : DRDO**
partially agree with the facts included in the
paragraphs. Few elements of Kaveri project
viz. Altitude testing & flying test bed trials were
not taken in to account. It was mainly due to
lack of aero engine development knowledge
& expertise in the country and non willingness
of other countries to share their development
experience. It is a fact that the project has
been delayed by about 12 years, but during
the period 1989 -2010, Kaveri, indeed, made
a considerable progress, attaining technical
maturity and establishing technology base
by completing high altitude testing of Kaveri.
Though the project cost is enhanced to Rs.
2839 Cr. (FE Rs 1730 Cr.), only Rs. 2105 Cr.
was authorized for interim flight trials of Kaveri
(first phase), keeping balance Rs. 734 Cr. for
final version Kaveri engine (which has not been
authorized to be utilized so far). Action Taken


-----

Note (ATN) has been forwarded to Audit on
December 21, 2010 for vetting.

**II** **Undue favour to a foreign vendor in**
**procurement of fleet tankers**

Indian Navy awarded a contract for acquisition
of a fleet tanker to a foreign shipyard even

though the steel to be used by the shipyard in

construction did not meet Indian Navy technical

specifications. Commercial negotiations with

the foreign vendor for procurement of a fleet

tanker, despite being protracted and delayed,

did not address the issue of reasonability of

pricing adequately. Excess provisioning of

spares of Rs. 30.44 Cr. and under-realisation

of offset benefit to Indian industry were also

noticed in the procurement of the tanker worth

Rs. 936 Cr..

**_(Paragraph 2.1)_**

**III** **Import of radars by a PSU against**

**indigenous manufacture order**

Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) was awarded

a contract for supplying 22 surveillance

Radar Element radars at a cost of Rs. 870

Cr.. The contract was signed by the Ministry

under special dispensation of the Defence

Procurement Procedure on the premise

that BEL would be able to manufacture the

radars indigenously as they had absorbed

the technology transferred from the Original

Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). BEL violated

this intent by procuring 60 percent radars in

Completely Knocked Down form from the


OEM at a lower cost. As a result, BEL earned

unwarranted additional returns of Rs. 10 Cr..

Supplying completely knocked down radars

instead of indigenously manufactured ones

also resulted in premature delivery before

finalization of associated works services with

no benefit to the Indian Air Force.

**_(Paragraph 2.2)_**

**IV** **Undue benefit to HAL on account of**
**pricing policy**

Hindustan Aeronautics Limited follows a Fixed
Price Quotation (FPQ) Policy for the pricing of
the supplies and services made to Indian Air
Force. Delay of four years in finalising the base
year to be used for the FPQ Policy resulted in
Indian Air Force incurring extra expenditure
of Rs. 400 Cr.. Further, notwithstanding
Government instructions to the effect that no
budgetary support for wages increase would
be provided separately and that resources for
funding the increased cost on account of wage
revision have to be generated by the company
internally, Indian Air Force reimbursed arrears
on account of wages and gratuity to the extent
of Rs. 315 Cr..

**_(Paragraph 2.4)_**

**V** **Abnormal delay in integration of Recce**
**Pods onboard an aircraft**

The Ministry of Defence procured an aerial
reconnaissance system costing Rs. 640.70 Cr.
from M/s IAI Elta, Israel without fully evaluating
the system as per Defence Procurement
Procedure. Despite spending Rs. 611 Cr. and


-----

delay of over one year, the system is yet to be
proven.

**_(Paragraph 3.1)_**

**VI** **Under utilisation of infrastructure**
**created**

The sanction for a Blade manufacturing facility
at a cost of Rs. 72 Cr. was taken based upon
the consumption levels of the required blades
in 1999-2000 and not on actual force levels
which would prevail at the time when the Blade

Manufacturing Unit would be operational,
between 2007 and 2018. The actual

requirement for these blades was only 50.62
per cent of the original projection in 2009.
Since the facility is likely to be completed only
by September 2010, its utility would be further
limited in view phasing out of the aircraft for
which this facility has been created.

**_(Paragraph 3.3)_**

**VII** **Injudicious expenditure on procur-**
**ement and overhaul of helicopter**
**engines**

Despite knowing the facts that two Kamov 25
helicopters with the Navy were old and in a
poor material state with virtually no product
support, Ministry of Defence concluded
contracts with a foreign firm for their overhaul
at a cost of Rs. 10.38 Cr.. Not only was the
quality of the overhaul poor but expenditure
amounting to Rs. 8.14 Cr. became unfruitful
as flying operations on these two helicopters
were discontinued due to sever defects in their
engines. Related procurement of spare KA 25


engines also became wasteful as the engines

could not be utilised.

**_(Paragraph 4.1)_**

**VIII** **Mid Life Upgrade of Mine Sweeper**

**ships**

The Midlife Update (MLU) of Indian Navy’s

four minesweepers envisaged upgradation

of the Mine Counter Measure capability by

providing them with a state-of-the-art Mine

Counter Measure System Suite (MCMS). The

MLU has been completed in the case of three

ships after a delay of about two years without

the fitment of vital MCM suite and weapon

systems valuing Rs. 170 Cr.. Advantages

accruing from the subsequent installation of

the equipment will be off-set by the limited

residual life of the ships.

**_(Paragraph 4.4)_**

**IX** **Procurement of shipborne Electronic**

**Warfare System**

Despite an on-going indigenous programme

for development of Electronic Warfare

systems, Indian Navy spent Rs. 472 Cr. on

import of seven Electronic Warfare systems,

on the grounds of operational emergency. The

timeline of nine weeks given by the Raksha

Mantri was over-shot considerably and it

took 176 weeks to finalise this contract. The

expenditure, thus, could not meet the urgent

operational requirement.

**_(Paragraph 2.6)_**


-----

**X** **Inordinate delay in development of Air**
**Bases**

The Ministry sanctioned the establishment of
an airbase at Phalodi in 1985 and an Air Force
station in South India in 1984. Even after two
decades both are yet to be commissioned. As
on date, the utility of the air base and station
has not been determined, given the constantly
vacillating position of the Indian Air Force
on their future use. In the case of Phalodi,
the Indian Air Force intends to use the base
for helicopter operations though the base was
envisaged as a strategic forward base airfield.
In the second case, the intended air cover over
sensitive installations remains elusive in the
absence of an active and operational air base.

**_(Paragraph 2.7)_**

**XI** **Injudicious procurement of pumps**

Naval authorities ordered 44 pumps worth
Rs. 4.56 Cr. without adequate user trials.
Subsequent to delivery, the pumps could not be
installed on-board the ships they were meant
for due to fitment problems. Thus these ships,
even six years after many of the pumps being
declared Anticipated Beyond Economical
Repair (ABER), continue to operate with the
old pumps rendering the entire expenditure
infructous.

**_(Paragraph 4.3)_**

**XII** **Unfruitful expenditure on submarine**
**rescue facility**

Owing to poor planning, lack of need

assessment and absence of a conclusive time


bound agreement with US Navy, there was

an inordinate delay in commissioning the

Indian Navy submarine rescue facility. The

expenditure of Rs.3.35 Cr. incurred could

not serve its objective as by now 75 per cent

submarines of Indian Navy have already

completed three fourths of their estimated

operational life.

**_(Paragraph 2.5)_**

**XIII** **Irregular commercial exploitation of**

**Santushti Shopping Complex**

Ministry of Defence and Air Force authorities

violated rules and regulations in managing

the Santushti commercial shopping complex

established on Government land. Irregular

allotment of shops has defeated essentially

welfare role of providing assistance to ex-service

personnel or family members of bereaved

service personnel like war widows, disabled

pensioners etc. Further, the Ministry’s decision

to suspend the eviction process without taking

any action for more than two and a half years

has allowed unauthorised occupants to retain

possession of these shops for more than 13

years. Delay in revision of licence fee and

irregular crediting of revenue to non-public

fund by Indian Air Force authorities in violation

of Ministry’s directives and Government

orders has deprived the Exchequer of revenue

amounting to Rs.9.75 Cr..

**_(Paragraph 2.3)_**


-----

**XIV** **Excess procurement of Electronic**

**Warfare Systems**

Indian Navy did not properly take into account

the phase-out schedule of its Tu-142M aircraft

while placing orders for the AES-210 and Homi

Electronic Warfare (EW) systems leading to the

excess procurement of one AES-210 system and

one Homi System. This resulted in infructuous

expenditure of Rs. 19.19 Cr. on EW systems

for non-existent or already phased out aircraft.

Besides, given the phase out schedule of the

aircraft fleet, two AES-210 systems and three

HOMI systems procured for Tu-142 M aircraft

would be exploited for less than 50 per cent of

their useful life.

**_(Paragraph 4.2)_**

**XV** **Financial irregularities in organising**

**Military World Games 2007**

Approval for funding for the Military World

Games (MWG) 2007, organised by the

Services Sports Control Board, was taken from

a lower competent financial authority for Rs.50

Cr. even though expenditure was estimated to

be Rs.138 Cr. by omitting certain works from

the proposal. The financial arrangements have

resulted in unspent balances lying outside of

Government account, foregoing of revenue

and diversion to non-public funds. Ministry

failed to monitor the expenses incurred on

MWG and the unspent amount has not yet

been credited to Government Account.

**_(Paragraph 2.8)_**


**XVI** **Irregularities in the procurement of**
**Microlight Aircraft**

Indian Air Force did not adhere to the procedures
prescribed for tendering, price negotiation and
release of funds while procuring the Composite
Technology Short Wing Microlight Aircraft.
Instead, actions and decisions were regularised
subsequent to placement of the order.

**_(Paragraph 3.2)_**

**XVII** **Avoidable expenditure on repair of an**
**aero-engine under warranty**

An Indian Air Force Equipment Depot failed to
exercise the contractual terms and conditions
and thus a repair task which was to be
undertaken under warranty   free-of-cost was
taken up as a regular task on payment basis.
This resulted in an avoidable expenditure of
Rs.1.09 Cr..

**_(Paragraph 3.4)_**

**XVIII Foregoing of revenue due to non-**

**revision of licence fee rates for**
**residential accommodation**

Non-adherence of the procedure by Ministry for
revising licence fee rates for accommodation
occupied by service personnel, every three
years, resulted in foregoing of revenue worth
Rs. 13 Cr..

**_(Paragraph 3.5)_**

**XIX** **Injudicious transportation of containers**
**for UN Mission**

Ministry of Defence authorised overseas
transportation of containers in excess of that


-----

prescribed by the United Nations Peacekeeping
Force for the purpose of claiming reimbursement.
As a result, the Indian Government incurred
avoidable extra expenditure to the extent of
Rs. 38.96 lakh.

**_(Paragraph 3.6)_**

**XX** **Loss in procurement of petroleum**
**products**

Indian Navy did not take advantage of ‘prompt
payment’ discount and also could not negotiate

discount on account of high volumes leading

to a loss of Rs. 136.39 Cr..

**_(Paragraph 4.5)_**

**XXI** **Lack of due care in passing claims of**

**vendors**

Naval officials did not exercise required care

in passing claims of vendors or in availing the

benefit of exemption from excise duty. As a

result, Indian Navy incurred an expenditure of

Rs. 1.61 Cr., out of which Rs. 1.40 Cr. could be

recovered at the instance of Audit.

**_(Paragraph 4.7)_**

**XXII** **Delay in fruition of Online Examination**

**System of Navy**

Although Indian Navy decided to migrate to

an online computer-based examination system

in 2004, flaws in the tendering process led to

delay in awarding a contract and commencing

the Indian Navy Online Examination System.

As of June 2010, despite an expenditure of Rs.


97.92 lakh, the Indian Navy will not be able to

conduct all planned examination online even

by 2013.

**_(Paragraph 4.6)_**

**XXIII Recoveries/ savings at the instance of**

**Audit**

An amount of Rs. 3.40 Cr. was recovered/

saved in two cases in respect of Air Force and

Rs. 2.30 Cr. in three cases in respect of Navy

after having been pointed out by Audit.

**_(Paragraph 3.7, 4.7 and 4.8)_**

**Report No. 7 of 2010-11**

**I.** **operation and Maintenance of Mi**
**series Helicopters in IAF**

Helicopters are a key component of defence

capability as they make a unique contribution

to a wide range of operations. India is a vast

country with long borders and possesses some

of the world’s most inhospitable terrain, be it

high mountains in the north, dense jungles in

the north-east, deserts of Rajasthan or the Rann

of Kutch. Many of these areas are not accessible

by road or any other means. It has been the

helicopter fleet of the IAF that has provided

communication, logistics to these remote areas

and played its part in combat role too.

Almost 60 per cent of this fleet comprises of

Mi series helicopters. A performance audit

of Mi series helicopter fleet’s operation and

maintenance was conducted. The review

revealed that, operationally, there are gaps in


-----

the existing force levels since the Indian Air

Force (IAF) is operating with only 74 per cent

of the helicopters against its current operational

requirements. Besides, a large proportion of

the helicopter fleet will reach the end of their

operational life in the near future. Further,

despite availability of funds and a specific

acquisition programme, IAF was unable to

induct even a single helicopter between 2002

and 2007. Although IAF’s own needs were not

being met, 25 helicopters were sent abroad

for participation in UN missions and seven

helicopters were modified for VIP role without

approval of the Government. Efficiency of

fleet operations, as indicated by achievement

of flying tasks, was an area which requires

improvement.

On the repair and maintenance side, audit

noted that there were delays in creating repair

and maintenance facilities for newly acquired

helicopters. At the facilities created, i.e. the

designated Base Repair Depot, a large number

of allotted overhauls tasks could not be

completed due to shortage of spares on account

of delayed and inadequate provisioning.

Consequently, 210 engines had to be sent

abroad for overhaul at a cost of Rs. 68.49 Cr..

Quality of work done by the depot was a matter

of concern as several engines overhauled by it

had to be prematurely withdrawn. The sub
optimal performance by the maintenance

agency, ageing fleet, non-availability of spares

also resulted in reduced serviceability and

lowered flying efforts at unit level. In fact, the

serviceability levels fluctuated between 45 to


75 per cent while shortfalls in achievement of

flying tasks ranged from 47 to 67 per cent for

the period 2003 to 2009 in respect of medium

lift helicopters.  The BRD also utilised 42 per

cent excess man hours in overhaul of aero

engines in comparison to prescribed standard

man hours.

All in all, the Mi fleet is performing its tasks in

a commendable manner despite the ageing of

fleet and numerous challenges in maintaining

serviceability. In light of the deficiencies noted,

certain recommendations have been made by

audit in the report to complement Ministry of

Defence and IAF’s efforts in ensuring that its
helicopter fleet retains its operational edge.

**II.** **Functioning of the Aviation Arm of the**
**Indian Navy**

The Aviation Arm of the Indian Navy was
established in May 1953 with the commissioning
of INS Garuda, a Naval Air Station at Kochi.
History of Naval aviation, spanning over
half a century, has been an illustrious one
and today, the Indian Navy is one of the few
navies in the world which can boast of an
aircraft carrier alongwith a multi-faceted fleet
in terms of platforms and technologies. The
Naval Aviation Arm contributes to combat
capability through carrier-borne strikes against
maritime targets in areas beyond the reach of
conventional land-based Air Force aircraft, air
defence of the fleet, reconnaissance and antisubmarine warfare.

The Aviation Arm holds the key to achieving
the “blue water” aspirations of the Indian Navy.


-----

As such, a Performance Audit was conducted
into the functioning of the Aviation Arm for the
period 2003-08, later updated to December
2009. The review indicated weaknesses in
the planning, asset management, operation,
repair and maintenance activities. There have
been significant delays/ shortcomings in the
preparation and finalisation of the long term
acquisition plans. Ad hoc planning resulted in
the spill-over of a number of schemes originally
envisaged in the X Plan (2002-07) to the XI

Plan. The fleet being operated by the Indian

Navy, at present, is critically short in terms of
numbers and even after potential inductions

during the period 2007-12, the Aviation Arm

is likely to achieve only 26, 33 and 63 per

cent of the force levels required in respect on

long range reconnaissance, combat and anti
submarine warfare aircraft respectively. Indian

Navy’s air combat capabilities have been

drastically reduce owing to availability of only

one carrier, which is almost half a century

old and is to be decommissioned in 2012.

The Wing is also characterised by ageing and

obsolescent assets. Attack capabilities of the

already depleted aircraft fleet on-board the

carrier have been restricted in the absence of

a fully functional radar and limited firing of

practice missiles.

Modernisation and upgradation activities have

not been as successful as envisaged. Induction

of sophisticated equipment to augment

capabilities in electronic warfare and provision

of Beyond-Visual-Range armament have taken

inordinately long periods, first, to be proven

and then to be inducted.


Operationally, availability of aircraft has been
poor on account of inefficient repair and
maintenance as also the need to conserve assets.
Serviceability levels were low in comparison to
the approved Unit Establishment for combat,
ASW and MRSR aircraft and these levels were
achieved only by decreasing the flying tasks to
ensure that the assets are not stretched rather
than increasing efficiency. At any given point
in time a large proportion of the aircraft assets
were under repair, maintenance or storage.
Further, the age of assets itself has implied that
repair and maintenance activities need to be
functioning at a very high level. During 200308, about 80 per cent inspections (repair and
maintenance) were delayed at the NAY/ Base
Support Facility.

Thus, the Naval Aviation Arm is operating under
numerous constraints and the existing fleet is
not geared to effectively meet the increasing
maritime needs of the Navy. This report has
also incorporated certain key recommendations
which the Ministry and Navy may consider for
implementation.

designed and developed by the Company is a
light 5.5 tonne class, multi-role, multi-mission
helicopter, fitted with two Turbomeca TM 333
2B2 engines. A sum of Rs. 1,541 Cr. (Rs. 960
Cr. by the defence customer and Rs. 581 Cr.

by the Company) was spent till September

2009 on the ALH project. Audit observed the


following:

- The design and development of ALH

started in 1984. The collaboration

agreement entered in 1984 was

terminated in 1995 even though certain

systems were yet to be developed,

validated and integrated. As a result,

five prototypes of the basic versions

which were to be certified by 1994

were actually flight tested and certified

in October 2003.

- Despite more than two decades, the

technical requirements finalised in

1979 by Army and Air Force were not

fully achieved resulting in flying of the

74 ALH supplied by the Company to

defence customers with concessions.

- Taking up Limited Series Production

(LSP) of ALH (2001-2003) even while

the prototypes were being flight

tested (1992-2003) and certified, was

premature as large number of design

problems were encountered during the

manufacturing.

- By not freezing the design of ALH and

keeping the development stage open

the Company had to accommodate

the increasing demand of the customer

for latest and additional requirements.

This led to 363 modifications in 34

helicopters (total 74 supplied to Defence

customers).


-----

- The ALH, which was to be successor

to Cheetah/Chetak was found to be

unsuitable for the intended multi-role

requirements due to excess weight and

limited power of the engine. ALH with

‘Shakti’ (higher-powered engine) which

was planned to be certified in December

2006 is yet to be certified even after

a delay of three years resulting in

postponement of delivery schedule of

20 ALH with Shakti engine from 2008
09 to 2009-10.

- Weapon system integration (WSI) version

of ALH has not been developed even

after a lapse of 10 years (1998 to 2009).

In the absence of clear understanding

of the requirements between Navy and

the Company, the amount of Rs. 138

Cr. spent on the project has not resulted

in any tangible benefit to the customer.



- The Company could not penetrate into
the international market in the absence
of international certificate in spite of
showcasing ALH in the air shows.
The Company could not successfully
execute even the order received from
civil market.

- As against the envisaged indigenisation
level of 50 per cent, about 90 per cent
of the value of material used in each
helicopter is procured from foreign
suppliers.

###### Audit Report No. CA 9 of 2009-10

which was in contravention of the terms of the
purchase orders.
