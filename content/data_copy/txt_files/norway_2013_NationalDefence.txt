The principal objective of Norwegian security policy
is to safeguard Norway’s sovereignty, territorial
integrity and political freedom of action. Norway’s
fundamental security interest is to contribute to a
world order under the auspices of the UN with the
emphasis on human rights and the international rule
of law. In addition it is most important to strengthen
and develop further the transatlantic security
community through NATO. Nationally the High
North is Norway’s most important area for strategic
investment.

The Norwegian Armed Forces constitute one of the
most important instruments available to the
Norwegian authorities to underpin the following
overarching security policy objectives:

#### • To prevent war and the emergence of various
kinds of threats to Norwegian and collective
security

#### • To contribute to peace, stability and the further
development of the international rule of law under
the auspices of the UN

#### • To uphold Norwegian sovereignty, rights, interests
and values, and to protect Norwegian freedom
of action in the face of political, military or other
pressure

#### • Together with our Allies, to defend Norway and
NATO against assault or attack

#### • To protect the society against assault and attack
from state and non-state actors


## Norwegian security and defence policy  Security policy objectives


-----

The defence policy objectives constitute the central
link between security policy and defence policy. They
set out what the Norwegian Armed Forces must
contribute in order to ensure the fullest possible
achievement of the overarching security policy
objectives.

The defence policy objectives are the following:

#### • Alone and together with Allies, to secure
Norwegian sovereignty, rights and interests as well
as maintaining Norwegian freedom of action in the
face of military or other pressure

#### • Through participation in multinational peace
operations authorised by UN mandate and
through international defence cooperation, to
contribute to peace, stability, the enforcement of
international law and respect for human rights,
and to prevent the use of force by state and nonstate actors against Norwegian and international
security

#### • To counter all kinds of assaults or attacks in order
to safeguard Norwegian and collective security
and, together with Allies, to contribute to the
collective defence of Norway and other Allies in
accordance with our NATO Treaty obligations

#### • To contribute to safeguarding the security of
Norwegian society, saving lives and limiting the
consequences of accidents, natural disasters,
assaults and attacks by state or non-state actors

### NNorwegian security and defence policy  Defence tasks

The tasks and level of ambition of the Norwegian
Armed Forces reflect in operational terms the
security and defence policy aims. The Norwegian
Armed Forces have a broad spectrum of tasks both in
peace, in times of crisis and in armed conflict or war.
The Norwegian Armed Forces have been given the
following nine tasks in the current Long-Term
Defence Plan (White Paper 73 S 2011-2012,
_“A Defence for our Time”):_


1. Provide a preventive threshold for war based on
NATO membership
2. Defend Norway and its allies against serious
threats, assaults or attacks within the framework
of NATO’s collective defence
3. Avert and manage episodes and security crises
using national resources, including preparation
for allied involvement if necessary
4. Ensure that there is a sound basis for national
decision-making through timely surveillance and
intelligence
5. Uphold Norwegian sovereignty and sovereign
rights
6. Safeguard the exercise of authority in
demarcated areas
7. Participate in international crisis management
including peace support operations
8. Contribute to international cooperation in the
area of defence and security.
9. Contribute to the safeguarding of public safety
and other central social tasks

In principle, the size and capability of the main
elements of Norway’s defence structure are designed
to meet the requirements of tasks 1-7 above. At the
same time, however, the size and equipment of
individual elements shall take into account the
requirement to provide support to the civil
community.


-----

## Norwegian security and defence policy   The Government’s main priorities

In executing the new Long-Term Plan, the
Government will give particular priority to:

#### • Strengthening the Norwegian Armed Forces’ ability
to provide a preventive threshold for war through
the further development of their collective
capabilities, and viewing military capacity in an
overall perspective both nationally and in an Allied
context

#### • Contributing to international operations in order to
ensure international peace and stability, promote
a UN-led world order and contribute to NATO’s
collective capacity for bringing about stability and
preventing war

#### • Developing further the ability of the defence
sector to assist the civil community in crisis
situations smoothly and efficiently by arranging
regular exercises with other sectors and
agencies including the clarification of roles and
responsibilities

#### • Strengthening the work of introducing preventive
protection measures across all sectors of the
community in the areas of security and IT security

#### • Addressing the competency challenges facing the
defence sector through reforms that will develop
further the sector’s ability to attract, recruit
and employ the right personnel with the right
competencies while at the same time ensuring
that all personnel are well looked after.

## Norwegian security and defence policy    International cooperation  UN


The United Nations Organisation (UN) plays a key
role as an anchor point for Norwegian security policy.
The UN Treaty and the provisions of international law
are more important than ever in ensuring the
coordination of action needed to overcome the
majority of the security challenges that face the
global community. The aim is to build a world order
with the UN as a central actor, something which can
contribute towards ensuring a peaceful and more
stable path for global development. This is a world
order which is built on the foundations of
international law and one in which the use of force is
regulated.


This emphasis on international law and human rights
is a clear expression of support for international
solidarity, but it also reflects Norway’s own interest in
having clear international rules for the use of military
force or other means of exerting pressure. Norway is
therefore deeply engaged in ensuring that these
rules are observed internationally and that they are
strictly complied with in our own internal practices.

The UN does not itself have the resources to carry
out all the peace operations required to safeguard
international peace and security. In many cases,
therefore, the UN has granted a mandate for
operations to be carried out by a smaller number of


member states or regional organisations such as
NATO, the EU and the African Union (AU). NATO’s
operations in Afghanistan, Libya and the Balkans, the
AU’s operations in Darfur and Somalia, and the EU’s
operations in Chad and the Democratic Republic of
Congo are all examples of this. Sharing responsibility
in this way allows the regional organisations to
relieve the load on the UN, and strengthen the UN’s
role and credibility. A mandate from the UN gives
such operations the necessary legitimacy and
legality under international law.


-----

France’s full reintegration into NATO’s military
structure in spring 2009 is important both politically
and militarily. Changes in the nature of challenges to
international security that have taken place since
1990 have contributed to the shift in NATO’s focus
towards its capacity to prevent and deal with the
emergence of conflicts outside the NATO area and
with global threats. However, NATO’s fundamental
task is `still related to the collective defence of its
member countries and a mutual guarantee of their
security, since an armed attack on one shall be
considered an attack on them all.


NATO’s new strategic concept from 2010 will
contribute towards maintaining the organisation as a
credible actor into the future. In line with the political
guidelines in this concept, and as a result of the
running down of the operation in Afghanistan, and
the existence of the Norwegian Core Area Initiative,
NATO is in the process of increasing its focus on what
is the prime task of the Alliance, namely Article 5 of
the NATO Treaty, assuring the security of member
states. This means that NATO will improve its ability
to deal with security challenges in its own vicinity
and strengthen its profile in the member states, but
without weakening its ability to carry out operations
in other parts of the world.

### Norwegian security and defence policy   International cooperation

Within the overall framework of the UN, NATO
remains the cornerstone of Norwegian defence and
security policy. NATO is an alliance between 28 North
American and European countries dedicated to
fulfilling the goals of the North Atlantic Treaty signed
on 4 April 1949. Since then NATO has been the
principal foundation of the transatlantic security
system.


-----

### Norwegian security and defence policy   International cooperation   NATO


Among other things these are two initiatives that,
through increased international defence
cooperation, joint procurement of key capabilities
and an increased emphasis on training and
exercising, will give more operational capability for
the money spent and improve interoperability
between allied forces.

In 2012 NATO has been engaged in operations in
Afghanistan (International Security Assistance Force
– ISAF), Kosovo (Kosovo Force – KFOR) and an


anti-piracy operation (Operation Ocean Shield - OOS)
off the coast of East Africa. All these operations are
based either on a mandate from the UN Security
Council or on an invitation from the authorities of the
state concerned. In addition, NATO is running a
surveillance operation in the Mediterranean
(Operation Active Endeavour – OAE) based on Article
5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. The Alliance also
supports the African Union (AU) in assisting with the
operation in Somalia and with building up the
capability for peacekeeping operations in general.


Nevertheless the serious economic crises being faced
in many member countries constitute a major
challenge, not least in the discussions concerning
fairer burden sharing in the Alliance. Substantial cuts
in the defence budgets of member countries will
over time have an impact on NATO’s military
capability. In the so-called Defence Package adopted
at the Chicago Summit in May 2012, much emphasis
is placed on Smart Defence and the Connected
Forces Initiative.

### Norwegian security and defence policy   International cooperation   EU


As a non-member, Norway is one of the countries
contributing most to the EU’s civil and military crisis
management operations and its response forces.
Norway has declared both civil and military
personnel to the EU force register and we are
participating in the EU’s civil operations in Kosovo
and in Afghanistan. As a non-member, Norway also
has a unique collaborative arrangement with the
European Defence Agency (EDA).


Through a special cooperation agreement, Norway is
able to participate in the EDA’s programmes and
projects. Norwegian participation in the areas of
research and technology development is wideranging and Norway also makes a substantial
contribution to the development of military
capabilities. Norway also participates in the agency’s
work in support of increased cooperation, openness
and competition in defence procurement, and the
harmonisation of defence industry terms and
conditions.


The EU has clear ambitions to strengthen its own
security and defence arrangements as set out in its
Common Security and Defence Policy - CSDP. In
addition, the EU is showing an increased will and
ability to develop a defence capability and to carry
out both civil and military crisis management
operations. Norway has, within the constraints of
non-membership, an interest in positioning itself
close to the EU in the area of foreign and security
policy. At the same time, Norway’s formal influence
vis-à-vis the EU is limited to the participatory rights
that we have been granted.

### Norwegian security and defence policy  International cooperation  Nordic cooperation


Nordic Defence Cooperation, NORDEFCO, is
extensive and works very well despite the countries’
differing relationships with the EU and NATO. There is
a high degree of commonality between the security
policy assessments and security interests of the
Nordic countries. Acting together, the Nordic
countries can make a greater contribution to peace
support operations than each country could make
individually.

All the Nordic countries participate in international
operations under the auspices of the EU, NATO and


the UN. In 2008 and 2011 Norway, Sweden and
Finland participated in a Nordic Battlegroup jointly
with Ireland and Estonia. Cooperation in training and
exercising is extensive both at single service and
joint operational level. This is very beneficial in terms
of both operational value and cost-effectiveness.

The Nordic countries have identified a number of
high priority capability areas where their future
needs coincide. Cooperation in the area of studies
and in research and development is already well
established and continues to be actively pursued,


not least between the Nordic defence research
agencies. As a consequence of the Nordic countries’
active participation in international operations, the
countries are working together on how best to care
for the needs of returning veterans. Cooperation in
the area of education and the development of
professional skills is also a growth area with good
contact between the various schools and centres of
excellence.

### Norwegian security and defence policy Total Defence and national civil-military cooperation


accidents have attained increased significance in the
context of national emergency planning. A guiding
principle in working to ensure the security of society
is that the authority, which has day-to-day
responsibility for a particular sector, also has
responsibility for emergency planning and the
implementation of emergency measures in a crisis
situation.

Responsibility for ensuring the security of society
rests with the police and other civil authorities in
situations where the security of the state itself is not
threatened. If the resources of the civil authorities are
not sufficient, the Armed Forces can, if requested,
contribute to the security of society within the
constraints of the resources and skills available. The
Norwegian Armed Forces already contribute
routinely in ways such as assisting the civil
authorities in dealing with floods, forest fires and
serious accidents. Such civil-military cooperation falls
within the overall framework of Total Defence.

Total Defence is intended to ensure that society’s
collective resources, both civil and military, are used
to best effect in crisis management both in
peacetime and in war. When the concept of Total
Defence was first developed in the period following
the Second World War it was primarily envisaged in
terms of civil support for the Armed Forces in time of
crisis or war.


Arrangements and mechanisms have been
established over the years within the field of Total
Defence and these now form the cornerstone on
which Norway’s national security and the safety of its
society is based. The concept has been extended and
modernised in recent years so that greater emphasis
is now placed on mutual support and cooperation
between the Armed Forces and civil society across
the whole spectrum ranging from peacetime
through security crises to war.

The Armed Forces have always provided support to
the civil community but in recent years much more
emphasis has been placed on this aspect as an
integral part of the concept of Total Defence. The
atrocities of 22 July 2011 clearly highlighted the
need for the Armed Forces to be ready to provide
such support and the Government has made civilmilitary cooperation one of its main priorities.

The aim is make the Armed Forces still better
prepared to contribute to maintaining the safety of
society and other central social tasks. The aid
provided by the Armed Forces in peacetime will
normally take the form of supplementary assistance
to the civil authorities where the latter cannot
manage the crisis adequately on their own. Civil aid
to the military in time of crisis or war remains a
fundamental principle of Total Defence.


The principal task of the Norwegian Armed Forces is
to safeguard Norway’s sovereignty and defend the
country against external attack. National security is
an absolutely fundamental security requirement
which, if the state is faced with a serious threat, can
legitimise action involving many or all of the nation’s
resources. At the same time new security challenges,
such as international terrorism and the proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction, have brought the
security of society into sharper focus. In addition, a
range of risk factors, such as the danger from
infectious diseases, natural disasters and major

In important matters involving foreign and security
policy, the Parliament’s agencies are consulted prior
to final decisions being taken. Moreover, Clause 25 in
the Norwegian Constitution states that the armed
forces (“the land and naval forces of the Realm”) “may
not be increased or reduced without the consent of
Parliament.” The Standing Committee on Foreign
Affairs and Defence deals with matters concerning
military defence and civil preparedness.

The Minister of Defence heads the Royal Norwegian
Ministry of Defence and carries the constitutional
and political responsibility for the activities of the
Armed Forces. All matters not decided in Council are
decided by the Minister, or by departmental officials
on the Minister’s behalf.


So-called “military command matters”, i.e. matters
concerning mobilisation and defence plans, are dealt
with outside the Council. The Minister of Defence
presents such matters to the King in the presence of
the Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs
alone. This procedure is adopted only very
occasionally.

In peacetime it is the Ministry of Justice and the
Police that has responsibility for the coordination
of civil emergency planning. All other ministries are
responsible for emergency planning in their own
sectors.



## Defence structure and activities  Division of responsibility in Norway

According to the Norwegian Constitution, the King is
the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. This
authority is exercised by the King in Council of State,
i.e. by the Government. Political control of the Armed
Forces is exercised through cooperation and the
division of power between the Parliament and the
Government. It is the Government which has the
highest executive authority responsible for military
and civil preparedness in peacetime, and for the
command of all aspects of total defence in time of
crisis and war.

The Chief of Defence is the Defence Minister’s top
military adviser and the Chief of Defence’s strategic
functions are integrated with the Ministry. Military
command authority is delegated to military
commanders. The Chief of Defence is the country’s
highest ranking military official.

In addition to being the Defence Minister’s adviser,
the Chief of Defence is also the Government’s
principal adviser on military questions. He also
exercises full command of Norwegian Defence.

In time of war the Chief of Defence continues to be
the Government’s closest military adviser while the
operational command authority over the military
forces, with the exception of the Home Guard, is
assumed to be transferred to NATO’s Integrated
Command Structure. The Norwegian Joint
Headquarters (NJHQ) exercises command of joint
operations and coordinates territorial forces
remaining under national command in time of crisis
and war. The Joint Headquarters is also responsible
for Norwegian forces abroad.

The Department of Personnel and General
**Services is responsible for the defence sector’s work**
on preventive security measures and on personnel
matters including professional skill development.
The department is also responsible for the Ministry’s
internal administration.


The Department of Security Policy is responsible
for the handling of questions of security policy as
well as for the Ministry’s international activities,
contingency planning, total defence matters, crisis
management operations, questions of international
and military law, and external relations in the field of
security policy.

The Department of Finance and Management has
the overall responsibility for the planning and
development of defence activities, the organisation
and structure of the Armed Forces within the
particular long-term planning period. The
department also exercises management and control
of the activities of the Armed Forces.

The Department of Defence Policy and Long-Term
**Planning is responsible for strategic analysis and the**
development of overall defence policy for the longer
term, as well as defence sector planning including
multinational cooperation in the defence field. The
department is also responsible for Armed Forces
investments up to the point at which a decision to
invest is made. It also exercises overall supervision of
research and development in the defence sector,
including the administrative management of the
Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI).


The Ministry of Defence is organised in four
departments with a total staff of a little over 300.
There are both civilian and military posts at all levels
within the Ministry and all departments work both
for the Chief of Defence and for the political
leadership. The leadership of the Armed Forces forms
an integral part of the Ministry.

The principal task of the Royal Norwegian Air Force is
to produce air force units and capabilities and to
make these available for operations both in
peacetime, crisis and war, both in Norway and
abroad, and to ensure that forces are at constant
readiness for aerial surveillance, the exercise of
authority and the upholding of national sovereignty.
The Royal Norwegian Air Force is also responsible for
the operation of Search and Rescue helicopters.

The Inspector General Royal Norwegian Air Force,
supported by the Air Staff, is responsible for force
production and is based at Rygge.

Norway has chosen the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter as it
new combat aircraft and this aircraft will, for the
future, form the core around which the rest of the Air
Force structure will be built. The decision to procure
the F-35 is the most important driver in the
structuring of Norway’s future air defence, not least
with regard to the necessary changes in base and
support structure that will implemented in the
coming years.

## The Norwegian Armed Forces  Personnel Policy


27


An overarching objective of the personnel policy is
to attract and retain able and highly motivated
personnel with the depth and breadth of
competence required to undertake the missions of
the Norwegian Armed Forces. The armed services
must be perceived as an attractive work environment
with good opportunities for personal development.
Priority is put on recruiting, competence building,
career and leadership development, pay, family
aspects and health and safety. The Armed Forces’
personnel policy is to take account of the need for
the right competence at the right time and in the
right place, and to foster a shared culture that is both
inclusive and open to diversity.

The personnel structure of the armed Forces is
undergoing change to include more service
personnel on regular engagements and further
development of the new category of junior officers.
Continuing efforts are being made to provide
horizontal career paths for regular officers and other
ranks paths and to offer greater continuity.

Civilians make up 1/3 of all personnel employed in
the Norwegian Armed Forces and give the
organisation the diversity of professional skills that it
needs. Civilian employees cover mainly functions in
specific professional areas and the administration of
the base and support structure. Civilian personnel
represent a stable workforce and constitute a
valuable resource for the Armed Forces.

## The Norwegian Armed Forces  International operations and veterans


An action plan, “In Service for Norway”, for the care of
personnel before, during and after serving abroad
was put forward by the Government on 2 May 2011,
following up the measures contained in Report No.
34 (2008-2009) to the Norwegian parliament “From
Conscript to Veteran”.

The action plan has been developed on the basis of
broad interdepartmental cooperation between the
Ministries of Children, Equality and Social Inclusion,
Defence, Foreign Affairs, Health and Care Services,
Justice and Public Security and Labour. The action
plan encompasses 126 measures which are to be
implemented over the period 2011-2013.

The objective of the action plan is to improve
society’s recognition of, and provision of care for, the
personnel covered by the action plan. Of the 126
initiatives set out in the plan, over 80 relate directly
to Armed Forces veterans. The plan focuses on
preventive measures, competence building, crosssectoral cooperation, research and development and
measures to reinforce the recognition given to our
veterans. Society’s support for veterans needing
aftercare must be unified, coordinated and, as far as
is possible, seamless.


To provide a common point of contact for all
veterans, the Armed Forces Veteran Administration
(FVA) was established in 2006. In 2011 the project for
the Armed Forces Veteran Service was set up to
manage, coordinate and follow up the Government’s
action plan “In Service for Norway”. This project,
which from 1 August 2013 becomes a permanent
section of the Defence Staff, also provides a door
through which members of the Norwegian Armed
Forces can raise all kinds of veteran-related
questions. The Veteran Service is headed by the
Armed Forces Veteran Inspector who is the Chief of
Defence’s advisor on all questions concerning
veterans.

Veteran and employee organisations play an
important part in the work of improving the care and
facilities available to ex-service personnel and
veterans. The Ministry of Defence and the Armed
Forces Veteran Service will, on application, provide
financial support to veteran organisations and others
whose activities are directed towards veterans.


Participation in international operations is an
important and integral part of Norway’s security and
defence policy, and a steadily increasing number of
armed forces personnel will in future have served
overseas. Since 1947 around 100,000 Norwegian
men and women have taken part in almost 100
international operations. Both the Norwegian
Armed Forces and society at large have a strong
responsibility to take care of the subsequent welfare
of those who are sent out on demanding missions in
countries where war and conflict are rife.

As part of the investment in veterans’ welfare, in 2008
the Norwegian Armed Forces purchased the former
war veterans nursing home at Bæreia near
Kongsvinger. The centre is now known as the Armed
Forces’ Veterans Centre. The Centre has been fully
operational since 1 August 2009 and offers welfare
and recreation facilities to veterans and their families.

Personnel are entitled by law to one year’s follow-up
from the Ministry of Defence on completion of their
service and the compensation arrangements have
been strengthened. A special compensation scheme
has been introduced for the benefit of veterans who
suffer psychological disorders due to post-traumatic
stress as a result of service in international
operations.

## The Norwegian Armed Forces  Culture

The Armed Forces’ Department for Culture and
Tradition (FAKT) is an organisation consisting of the
former Armed Forces Commanderies, the Armed
Forces Museums, the Military Bands of the
Norwegian Armed Forces and the Armed Forces’
Veterans Centre. FAKT includes eight Commanderies,
the Armed Forces’ seven museums and five military
bands. FAKT’s principal objective is to strengthen
cultural activities in the Norwegian Armed Forces
and to provide a platform for dialogue both
internally and between the armed forces and civil
community at large. Cultural activities in the armed
services cover a broad spectrum country-wide.

Military bands make up Norway’s largest single
state-owned cultural institution with 153
professional musicians. The Armed Forces Museums
authority administers a substantial part of Norway’s
military cultural heritage while the Armed Forces
Commanderies constitute an important link between
the armed forces and the civil community. FAKT
administers major cultural institutions which
represent a major resource for the armed forces and
for the community at large, a resource which is
important both for the preservation of our military
traditions and ceremonies, and as one that opens a
window on our cultural heritage to the general
public.

## The Norwegian Armed Forces  National Service

##### National Service


According to the Norwegian Constitution, all fit male
citizens are obliged to serve in the defence of their
country. Liability to military service starts at the age
of 19, and continues until the age of 44. It is the
operational requirements of the Armed Forces that
will determine the number of conscripts undergoing
initial military service. The aim of the Armed Forces is
to ensure that it is the best qualified and most highly
motivated young people who undertake this initial
training.


30


An obligatory interview scheme for young women
has meant that the overall number of young men
and women attending initial interviews is rising to
about 60,000 each year. The introduction of the new
two-part interview scheme is now complete. As a
result of Part 1 the Armed Forces are able to select
about 25,000 to be called in to an interview centre
for Part 2. The aim is to increase the number of young
women undergoing initial military service and basic
officer training to 25 % of the total before 2015. As a
trial project, a small number of conscripts called up
in summer 2013 will be offered 18 months service in
the Army.

Those who are exempted from military service on
conscientious grounds will no longer have to
undergo a period of civilian service.

The Armed Forces will recruit the most suitable
young people for regular service on contract and for
officer training as either specialist or full career
officers. The National Service Administration, on
behalf of the Chief of Defence, has responsibility for
conscript administration covering all service
branches. This includes the arrangement of interview
sessions, the allocation of candidates and call-up for
initial military service. The National Service
Administration is also the holding unit for all service
personnel records and has a coordinating
responsibility for all recruiting for the Norwegian
Armed Forces.

## The Norwegian Armed Forces  Defence Budget


The consolidated defence budget for 2013 follows up
the Soria Moria declaration and continues the
emphasis placed on those areas of defence and
security policy set out in the declaration. Particular
priority is given to the High North, the Government’s
most important strategic area, and to support for
international peace operations and conflict
management, primarily under the auspices of the UN
and NATO, within the framework of a world order led
by the UN. The table below shows the headline
figures for 2013.

## The Norwegian Armed Forces  Materiel and investments


In 2012 the sea systems area will focus on taking
delivery of new materiel.

The programme for the air systems area will be
dominated in 2013 by the upgrading of F-16 combat
aircraft and P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft
together with the updating of the launch platforms
for NASAMS II.

The greater part of the funding for new combat
aircraft will be devoted to initial payments for the
acquisition of four F-35 aircraft for training purposes,
a shared programming laboratory in the United
States, weapons development (JSM and 25mm
aircraft ammunition (Apex)), costs of participation in
the multinational programme and investigation
work.

Programme activity in the area of network-based
defence systems in 2013 will cover a number of
information infrastructure projects.


In the area of logistics systems, the plan for 2013
includes substantial expenditure on the procurement
of a new logistics and support vessel. Activities will
also include the acquisition of materiel needed in
establishing a base in the field. Work will also
continue on upgrading the capability and protection
of armoured NBC reconnaissance vehicles.

In the area of Special Forces and soldier systems,
costs associated with the acquisition of weapons,
clothing and other equipment will account for the
predominant part of expenditure incurred in 2013.
The funding allocation for property, buildings and
installations will in 2013 be devoted to investment
resulting from the restructuring of the Armed Forces
and to the completion of projects associated with
the realisation of the new structure set out in the
Long-Term Plan endorsed by the Norwegian
parliament in 2008. This includes planning of the
helicopter base at Bardufoss with a detachment at
Haakonsvern.
uuu


The Government continues in 2013 to give weight to
the ongoing modernisation of the Norwegian Armed
Forces. Investment activity in 2013 will focus on
investments which support the structure endorsed in
the Long-Term Defence Plan 2013-2016 (White Paper
73 S 2011-2012, “A Defence for our Time”. The total
investment budget amounts to 10,851 million NOK
made up of 8,779 million NOK for investment in
materiel and 2,072 million NOK for investment in
nationally and jointly funded property, buildings,
installations and materiel. The main share of the
investment funding will be devoted to continuing
projects in which deliveries have already
commenced.

In the land systems area it is planned that the major
share of the expenditure will be for a number of
projects for the acquisition of further armoured
vehicle capacity, the largest of which by far being the
upgrading of the Army’s CV90 tracked combat
vehicles. Apart from this, substantial expenditure is
planned for the acquisition of remotely controlled
weapon stations and automatic mortars. Work will
also continue in connection with enhancing the
safety of personnel deployed on operations and the
ability of land forces to operate under a range of
different conditions.

33
## The Norwegian Armed Forces  Materiel and investments


A large part of the spending on property, buildings
and installations in 2013 will be devoted to projects
to maintain the standard of military buildings and
installations to meet the relevant legal requirements
and other regulations. Substantial expenditure is
therefore planned on basic works projects such as
runways, airfield hard standings and other
infrastructure associated with service establishments
and camps. These infrastructure investments are
important to the day-to-day running of the future
activities of the Norwegian Armed Forces.


In order to improve the Border Guard and increase
the efficiency of its operations, two new stations are
being built for the Garrison in Sør-Varanger, each of
which will cover its own section of the NorwegianRussian border. The building of stations in the south
in Svansvik continues and preparations are being
made to start building stations in the north at
Storskog.

Funds are also being spent on living quarters and
other buildings in Indre Troms and Øst-Finnmark.
This is important in the context of recruiting and
retaining well qualified officers and other ranks in the
Norwegian Armed Forces and of providing good
housing conditions for personnel undergoing their
initial military service.

## The Norwegian Armed Forces  International operations

The Norwegian Armed Forces’ contribution to
international operations abroad in 2013 involved, on **SNMCMG1Number: 38**
average, around 700 men and women. Norwegian **NORTHWOODNumber: 2**
participation in ISAF constituted the main
involvement of Norwegian military personnel during **Number: 3**
2012 and it will remain so for 2013. In 2011 the Afghan **Kosovo (1999-)**
government, in collaboration with NATO, started the **Number: 1**
process of transferring responsibility for the security of **Bosnia-Herzegovina (2005-)**
the first provinces from NATO to the Afghan security **Number: 1**
forces.

By the end of 2014 responsibility for security across **Number: 7**
the whole of Afghanistan will have been transferred to
the Afghan authorities and the ISAF operation will **MFO**
have ended. At the request of ISAF, Norway brought **Number: 3**
its military contribution in Faryab to an end as from 1
October 2012. The Norwegian force contribution **Sudan (2005-)UNMIS**
remaining in Afghanistan in 2013 will, while reduced **Number: 19**
in size, continue to meet ISAF’s requirements and will **Kongo (1960/64-)**
be concentrated in Mazae-e Sharif and Kabul.

In addition to its involvement in Afghanistan, Norway
will in 2013 be making less extensive contributions to
UN-led operations in Africa, the Middle East and
Kosovo. We also contribute personnel to the
multinational operation in Sinai (MFO).
