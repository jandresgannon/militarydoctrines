**INTRODUCTION**

The dynamic and controversial character of the contemporary
strategic security environment and the recent years’ trend at reduction
of the resource provisioning of the Armed Forces has led to imbalance
between the planned capabilities and the allocated on their building
and maintenance funding. To the end of establishing an acceptable
balance between the available resources and the development of the
needed for the Armed Forces missions and tasks implementation
capabilities, taking into account the changes in the strategic security
environment and the mid-term new capabilities acquisition and AF
modernization priorities, in 2014 was undertaken a “Review of the
Defence Capabilities and the Capacity of the Armed Forces to
implement the tasks arising from the three missions”.

In the course of the Review, the following areas had been
considered: the dynamic and rapidly changing character of the strategic
security environment as well as the approaching our borders zones of
instability; the political commitment made at the Wales NATO
Summit for a progressive increase of defence spending and
achievement of 2% of GDP; the capabilities necessary to guarantee the
sovereignty, security and independence of the country in the
framework of NATO collective defence; the implementation of our
commitments to NATO and the EU and contribution to national
security at peacetime; national commitments to the implementation of
NATO Readiness Action Plan (RAP).

The Plan for the Development of the Armed Forces 2020 is an
outcome of the undertaken review and has been elaborated in
compliance with the set out in the Programme for the Development of
the Defence Capabilities of the Armed Forces of the Republic of
Bulgaria 2020 development parameters and guidelines for the build-up
of defence capabilities and the Armed Forces until 2020.

**Plan For The Development Of The Armed Forces Of The Republic Of Bulgaria 2020**


**I.** **General Provisions.**

**1.** **Background**

The Plan for the Development of the Armed Forces 2020[1] has
been developed pursuant to Article 62 of the Defence and the Armed
Forces Act of the Republic of Bulgaria and in implementation of
paragraph 9.2 of the Programme for the Development of the Defence
Capabilities of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria 2020
(hereinafter Programme 2020), adopted by Decision of the 43[rd]
National Assembly, promulgated in the State Gazette, issue
93/01.12.2015.

The Plan is adopted by the Council of Ministers pursuant to
Article 22, paragraph 2, item 6 of the Defence and the Armed Forces
Act of the Republic of Bulgaria.

**2.** **Justification**

The Plan will ensure the development of the Armed Forces until
2020 with balanced capabilities along all components for the
implementation of the full spectrum of tasks arising from the
anticipated scenarios and analyses of the development of the military
strategic security environment.

**3.  Objectives of the Plan**

   - To guarantee the implementation of the constitutional
obligations of the Armed Forces and ensure adequate contribution to
allied operations;

   - To develop an integrated system for effective defence
management under permanent civilian control bearing a potential for
agility, planning and effective response;

   - To support and develop available capabilities, build-up and
develop new capabilities and establish environment for the
development of the Armed Forces;

[1] Herein after referred to in the text as “the Plan”

**Plan For The Development Of The Armed Forces Of The Republic Of Bulgaria 2020**



   - To reach balance between needed capabilities and available
resources.
**4.  Scope of the Plan and Milestones of the Development**
**and Reorganization of the Armed Forces**

The Plan covers the main activities in the development of the
Armed Forces for the period 2016 – 2020 whereas the part related to
the build-up of new capabilities, modernization and rearmament goes
beyond 2020.

The development and reorganization of the Armed Forces will
be performed in two phases from 2016 to 31.12.2018 and from 2019 to
31.12.2020.

During the first phase, the main activities in the development of
the Armed Forces will be directed at stabilization of defence, as
follows:

   - Re-subordination of the military units pursuant to Programme
2020 where the timelines will be specified annually through an Order
of the Minister of Defence on organizational and staffing
modifications;

   - Priority filling the gaps in the personnel roster of declared
military units and units subject to certification as contribution to
NATO collective defence under the adopted Capability Targets 2013;

   - Development and launch of the main modernization
investment projects under Programme 2020;

   - Advancement of the processes of utilization of surplus
ammunitions and disposal of unnecessary infrastructure and
demilitarized real estate.

During the second stage, the main activities in the development
of the Armed Forces will be directed at their modernization and
restructuring, as follows:

   - Reorganization of the military units in the Armed Forces;

   - Furthering modernization and building new capabilities;

   - Disposal of redundant capabilities or replacement of obsolete
capabilities after the establishment of new ones;


**Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria** **7**

-----

**Plan For The Development Of The Armed Forces Of The Republic Of Bulgaria 2020**



   - Finalization of the processes of utilization of surplus
ammunitions and disposal of unnecessary infrastructure and
demilitarized real estate;

   - Achievement of the set in Programme 2020 proportion among
the three main lines of spending.

In 2018 we envisage a Review of the implementation of the
Plan. Depending on its implementation, resource provisioning,
implementation of modernization investment projects and the rate of
disposal of surplus real estate, property, armaments, equipment and
ammunitions, the need for reorganization of the military units will be
evaluated in the second phase.

In the event of amendments to the normative basis related to the
Plan, the same will be amended to reflect such amendments.

The downsizing of personnel will be made contingent with the
ongoing modernization, abandonment of redundant capabilities and the
process of disposal of surplus in defence.

The implementation of the outlined efforts during the
development and reorganization of the Armed Forces phases will be
undertaken under the terms and conditions stipulated by a law/act of
the Council of Ministers or by an act of the Minister of Defence.

**5.** **Assumptions**

To reach the optimal balance between needed defence
capabilities and the implementation of the missions and tasks of the
Armed Forces, in the period 2016 – 2018 defence spending will be
retained at a level not lower than that achieved by the 2014 State
Budget Act of the Republic of Bulgaria.

For the period after 2018 until 2024 is envisaged consistent
increase of defence spending depending on the growth in the economic
capacities of the country, in compliance with the decisions made at the
2014 NATO Wales Summit.

To implement the assigned missions and tasks, by the end of
2020 the Armed Forces will maintain a total size of not less than
37 000 and not more than 40 000 service members.

**Plan For The Development Of The Armed Forces Of The Republic Of Bulgaria 2020**


The forces and assets of the Armed Forces involved in the
implementation of tasks under this mission are specified according to
set out plans.

The level of ambition for each mission is based on concrete
allied commitments and the implementation of other national tasks
related to the security of the country.

**9.     Minimum Requirements to Defence Capabilities**
**arising from the tasks of the Armed Forces**

The minimum capability requirements are forces and assets
ensuring the successful implementation of the tasks under each
mission. They are defined on the grounds of ten planning scenarios
illustrating possible situations for the use of the Armed Forces and the
developed concepts and profiles to the planning scenarios.

**II.** **Structure of the Armed Forces**

**1.** **Functional structure of the Armed Forces**

The Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria build a single set
of forces and capabilities needed to ensure national defence and
participation in NATO collective defence system, the EU Common
Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) and other international
agreements, strictly complying with the resource capacities of the
country.

With respect to the missions and tasks, the taken political
commitments and NATO Force Structure (MC-317/1), the Armed
Forces, in the framework of the Single Set of Forces, functionally build
Deployable Forces and In-Place Forces.

   - The Deployable Forces are military units of the Armed Forces
with high mobility, high or lower readiness level, capable of
participating in NATO operations on the territory of the Alliance or
beyond under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty as well as in crisis
response operations.


14

### 14


**Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria**


-----

**Plan For The Development Of The Armed Forces Of The Republic Of Bulgaria 2020**


The Deployable Forces involve units declared for the goals of
collective defence in compliance with the agreed commitments and
responsibilities.

   - The In-Place Forces are units of the Armed Forces with
restricted mobility, high or lower readiness level, capable of
participating in operations on the protection of the territorial integrity
of the country or neighbouring countries within the collective security
and defence system; protection of the air and maritime sovereignty of
the country through integrated systems within NATO common systems
contributing to national security in peacetime and countering potential
asymmetric threats.

The number of In-Place Forces units with high and lower
readiness level is specified in accordance with the requirements of the
planning documents, the development of the security environment, the
tasks related to the defence of the country and the actual capacities for
their resource provisioning.

The Forces include units of the Land Forces, Air Force and
Navy, logistics and communications components directly subordinated
to the Commander of the Joint Forces Command as well as structures
of the Fixed CIS and the Special Forces Brigade. The In-Place Forces
also involve structures directly subordinated to the Minister of
Defence.

**Levels of readiness for the use of the Armed Forces**

The Armed Forces units’ levels of readiness ensure the needed
agility in planning and conducting of operations. The adopted
classification of military units of the Armed Forces is in accordance
with the established NATO system (MC-317/1) and includes 11
categories with a range of readiness from 2 to over 365 days.

The Armed Forces units’ categories from 1 to 9 form the
Graduated Readiness Forces. The 10-11 division units form the Long
Term Build Up Forces.

The Graduated Readiness Forces are divided into High Readiness
Forces and Forces of Lower Readiness.


15

**Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria** **15**


-----

**Plan For The Development Of The Armed Forces Of The Republic Of Bulgaria 2020**


The High Readiness Forces are units of the Armed Forces with
categories from 1 to 8 and should be reported with readiness ranges for
use from 2 to 90 days.

Part of the High Readiness Forces units form the Immediate
Response Forces (IRF). The personnel of IRF needed for the
implementation of national tasks is commissioned by the Minister of
Defence on a proposal from the Chief of Defence.

The Forces of Lower Readiness are units of the Armed Forces
with category 9 and should be reported with readiness ranges for use
up to 180 days.

The number of High Readiness Forces and Forces of Lower
Readiness units of the Defence forces is specified in accordance with
the requirements of the planning documents, the development of the
security environment, the tasks related to the defence of the country
and the actual capacities for their resource provisioning. The transition
of units from one level to another is performed through established
procedures and the endorsed plans for multiplication of the readiness
of the Armed Forces.

Manning, armaments and assets depend on the level of
readiness.

The Long Term Build Up Forces consist of military formations
of the Armed Forces with prolonged establishment and multiplication
and are to be used in the worst case and most remote in time scenario
for large scale Article 5 of the Washington Treaty operations.

**2.  Organizational Structure of the Armed Forces**

The organizational structure of the Armed Forces clearly
illustrates the number of main structures and the profile of the Armed
Forces in general. The Organizational Structure of the Armed Forces
incorporates the Bulgarian Army (Joint Forces Command, Land
Forces, Air Force and Navy, Fixed Communications and Information
System, the Special Forces Brigade)[2] and the structures directly

subordinated to the Minister of Defence which are not subject to the
Administration Act. The Armed Forces personnel includes service
members at the Ministry of Defence and structures directly
subordinated to the Minister of Defence which are subject to the
Administration Act.

**2.1.** **The Joint Forces Command (JFC)**

The Joint Forces Command (JFC) is a functionally integrated
operational level command and control structure and implements the
full spectrum of missions and operations of the Armed Forces of the
Republic of Bulgaria. JFC exercises command and operational control
over its directly subordinated military units and over the forces and
assets of the force services assigned for participation in joint
operations.

The JFC integrates and implements joint training; planning and
execution of joint operations; joint intelligence; joint logistics; joint
communications and information support.

JFC upkeeps and develops the following capabilities:

**Mission Defence: planning and conduct of joint operations with**
its directly subordinated military units and operationally subordinated
units of the service branches for covering of the threatened state
border section, in accordance with the scenarios, enabling the
admission and deployment of allied troops for carrying out an
operation under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. In the event of
invocation of Article 5 of the Washington Treaty and contribution with
national military units from the declared forces for action on the
territory of other NATO member states, the JFC exercises national
control over the Bulgarian military units participating in the allied
operation.

**Mission Support of International Peace and Security:**
training, manning, logistic support, deployment, national control
(administrative management), rotation and withdrawal of the national
contingents participating in missions and operations outside the
territory of the state.


17

**Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria** **17**


-----

**Plan For The Development Of The Armed Forces Of The Republic Of Bulgaria 2020**


**Mission Contribution to National Security in Peacetime:**
command and control of the assigned and operationally subordinated
forces and assets of the services and interaction with local
administration and structures subordinated to other Ministries and
Agencies.

The organizational structure of the JFC by 2020 will incorporate
JFC Command and units for combat service support, logistics and
training.

The warehouses and bases of the Logistics brigade storing
surplus of the Armed Forces armaments, equipment, ammunitions and
other materiel, will be deactivated after disposal of the stored surplus
whereas the personnel quota of the deactivated warehouses and bases
will be redirected at the building and support of logistic support
capabilities in the Logistics brigade, building capabilities for planning
and conducting of joint operations by the JFC and the implementation
of host nation logistics commitments.

**2.2.** **Land Forces**

The Land Forces generate force, train and support Land Forces
units, capable of participation in the state’s defence to guarantee the
state’s security and territorial integrity alone or within joint
operational forces. They maintain state of readiness and participate
with units in international crisis response operations beyond national
borders, aid state and local authorities in preparing, supporting and
protecting the population, national economy and the territory of the
country in the event of natural disasters and crises and address their
consequences. They assist in safeguarding state borders and other
strategic facilities and countering illegal migration.

To the end of implementation of the assigned to the Land Forces
tasks, they maintain and develop capabilities arising from the three
missions of the Armed Forces, as follows:

**Mission Defence:** operational and tactical deployment and
defence of the country alone and within the collective defence system;
participation in collective defence actions outside the territory of the
country; participation in joint operations.


18

### 18


**Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria**


-----

**Plan For The Development Of The Armed Forces Of The Republic Of Bulgaria 2020**


**Mission Support of International Peace and Security:**
participation in international crisis response operations outside the
borders of the country reassuring peace and security; arms control and
nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction; confidence-building
and security promotion measures.

**Mission Contribution to National Security in Peacetime:**
contribute to the defence of critical infrastructure; aid state bodies in
countering terrorist groups and traffic of people, drugs and weapons;
support state and local authorities in other than war disasters and crisis
relief.

The development of Land Forces capabilities is related to the
optimization of their organizational structure. The new challenges in
the strategic security environment, the migration influx, the traffic of
people and the fact that 68% of the relief of the Republic of Bulgaria
consists of mountainous and semi-mountainous terrains, including
terrains along the almost whole southern and western border, justifies
the need of multiplication of the Land Forces capabilities for the
implementation of tasks in adverse field and weather conditions and in
assisting Border Police bodies in securing borders and countering
illegal migration.

The new organizational structure aims at ensuring effective
command, control and combat actions in operations guaranteeing the
security and territorial integrity of the country as well as aligning of
the structure with the requirements for deployable Gradual Readiness
Forces.

By 2020, the organizational structure of the Land Forces will
incorporate Land Forces Command, combat units and combat service
support, logistics and training units.

The development of the capabilities of the Land Forces calls for
the establishment of conditions for the launch of the Land Forces core
investment project “Establishing Battalion Battle Groups within the
Mechanized Brigades”. The implementation of this project will allow
for their rearmament with new infantry combat vehicle and for actions
within the full spectrum of land operations, including such at night
time and in extreme weather conditions. Furthermore, the


19

**Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria** **19**


-----

**Plan For The Development Of The Armed Forces Of The Republic Of Bulgaria 2020**


maneuverability, firepower and mobility of units in operation zones
will be improved.

**2.3.** **Air Force**

The Air Force guarantee the air space sovereignty and security
of the country and together with the other Armed Forces services
defend the state’s territorial integrity, participate in crisis response
international operations outside the territory of the country and
provide support to the population in other than war disasters and
crises.

To implement the assigned by the three missions tasks, the Air
Force maintain and develop the following capabilities:

**Mission Defence capabilities:** control of the airspace; air
interdiction of adversary facilities of operational and strategic
importance, close air support to the Land Forces and the Navy, aerial
reconnaissance, airlift, personnel and cargo airdrops and special
actions.

**Mission Support of International Peace and Security**
**capabilities:** airlift, personnel and cargo airdrops and aeromedical
evacuation in international crisis response operations outside the
territory of the country for peace and security reassurance.

**Mission Contribution to National Security in Peacetime**
**capabilities:** preserve the sovereignty and integrity of airspace (Air
Policing) including through joint actions with forces and assets of
other states ; provide umbrella over strategic facilities of the critical
infrastructure; assess and share aerial situation awareness; aerial
reconnaissance ; airlift of personnel and cargo; transportation of organ
transplant teams; aeromedical evacuation; unexploded ordnance
demolition; support to the population, local and central authorities in
the event of natural disasters, industrial emergencies and
environmental catastrophes; search and rescue operations and aerial
firefighting.

The development of the Air Force capabilities calls for
structural changes directed at improvement of the organizational
effectiveness, optimization of the functional and administrative
interface among the units, advancement of the training of cadets with


20

**Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria**


-----

**Plan For The Development Of The Armed Forces Of The Republic Of Bulgaria 2020**


diverse flight professional lines as well as training of officers, noncommissioned officers and privates of all branches of the Air Force
(aviation, anti-aircraft missile troops, radio-technical troops,
communications, information and navigation systems and logistics).

Of vital importance to the development of the Air Force is the
establishment of background for the implementation of key
modernization projects: acquisition of a new type multirole combat
aircraft and supply of integrated logistic support and new three
dimensions (3D) radars.

During the process of acquisition of a new type multirole
fighter, the performance of combat duty will continue to be carried out
with part of the active MiG-29 crews while at the same time the other
part will be training on the new fighter which aims at avoiding the
“vacuum” in Air Force capabilities. The acquisition of the new main
multirole fighter will practically replace the three types of presently
used aircraft – MiG-21, MiG-29 and SU-25 which will lead to
downsizing of the Air Force personnel and will reduce the funds
needed for the support of the whole combat aviation of the country
while the operational capabilities will be considerably enhanced. This
will also solve the problem with the frequency spectrum; operational
and informational interoperability with NATO and EU member states
Armed Forces will be achieved and capability shortfall will be
overcome.

The organizational structure of the Air Force by 2020 will
incorporate Air Force Command, air bases, anti-aircraft missile base
and bases for combat service support, logistics and training taking into
consideration the disposal of surplus armaments, equipment and the
downsizing of personnel after the implementation of the Air Force key
investment projects.

**2.4.** **Navy**

The Navy protects the interests of the Republic of Bulgaria in its
maritime space, guarantees the state’s maritime sovereignty and trains
formations for participation in international peace and security
reassurance operations, aids the population in the event of disasters,
emergencies and catastrophes. To implement the assigned by the three


21

**Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria** **21**


-----

**Plan For The Development Of The Armed Forces Of The Republic Of Bulgaria 2020**


missions tasks, the Navy maintains and develops the following
capabilities:

**Mission Defence capabilities:** deployment and integration in
NATO and EU units within designated timelines; combat actions
against air, overwater and underwater adversary; attack coast-based
targets; conduct mine warfare; employ special forces; conduct
electronic warfare; escort commercial and military vessels; control sea
navigation; undertake combat search and rescue operations, if
necessary with deck-based naval aviation; provide situational
awareness and perform resilient, permanent, secured operational
control of forces in “stand-alone” and joint operations.

**Mission Support of International Peace and Security:**
participation in joint multinational counter-terrorism operations,
prevention of illicit trafficking of people, goods and weapons by sea,
participation in embargo, humanitarian, evacuation and rescue efforts.

**Mission Contribution to National Security at peacetime:**
interaction with other agencies, government, non-government and
international organizations; control of sea navigation; aid the
population in the event of disasters and emergencies; protection of
important strategic facilities and maritime critical infrastructure;
maritime search and rescue operations, humanitarian and evacuation
operations, contribution to countering organized crime and drugs,
people and arms trafficking.

The development of the maritime capabilities requires the
building of a peacetime structure of the Navy that is as close in
character as possible to the combat one following the principle “the
ships of one division/detachment to be of the same branch of the Navy
forces”.

By 2020 the Navy structure will incorporate Navy Command, a
fleet of battle and support ships, two naval bases, coastal anti-ship
missile and artillery division and combat service and logistic support
units.

To develop maritime capabilities, it is necessary to provide
background for launching the major investment projects:
modernization of Class E-71 frigates and acquisition of
multifunctional modular offshore vessel. The implementation of the


22

### 22


**Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria**


-----

**Plan For The Development Of The Armed Forces Of The Republic Of Bulgaria 2020**


projects will enhance the capabilities for fighting overwater,
underwater and air adversary, controlling marine navigation and
countering maritime asymmetric threats.

Along with the development of warships, it is necessary to
acquire a modern command and control system, improve anti-mine
warfare capabilities and special operations efforts and acquire tugboats
and minelayers for the Navy.

**2.5.** **Fixed Communications and Information System**

The Fixed Communications and Information System (FCIS) is
designated to ensure secure communications and information support
for the command and control system in the implementation of the full
spectrum of missions and tasks of the Armed Forces of the Republic of
Bulgaria.

The FCIS is the main provider of communication and
information services for the Armed Forces Services and the Joint
Forces Command and develops capabilities for communications and
information support and security of information according to the
implementation of tasks arising from the missions of the Armed
Forces.

The need for building a cyber defence capability of the
command and control system requires organizational and staffing
changes of the FCIS establishing a cyber defence structure.

**2.6.** **Special Forces Brigade**

The Special Forces Brigade incorporates specially established,
organized, trained and equipped units employing methods and
techniques different from those of the conventional forces. The Special
Forces Brigade is tasked with the conduct of special operations in the
implementation of specific strategic and clearly defined operational
goals. The Special Forces Brigade supports capabilities adding to the
available capabilities of the Armed Forces through an effective tool of
response to asymmetric and hybrid threats, contributing to the
multiplication of the common military capabilities to guarantee

national security and defence and achieve full participation in NATO
and EU collective defence system.

**2.7.** **Structures directly subordinated to the Minister of**

**Defence**

   - **Military Information Service**

The Military Information Service ensures the early detection and
warning of security risks and threats to the Republic of Bulgaria and
provides strategic intelligence information to the state and military
leadership, the Bulgarian contingents abroad, NATO, the EU and
partner services.

The Military Information Service supports, builds and develops
capabilities in the Information Support area related to collecting and
submitting to the state and military leadership of timely and reliable
information contributing to political and managerial decision-making
in the area of security and defence of the country in compliance with
the implementation of the tasks arising from the missions of the
Armed Forces.

An important accent in the activity of the Military Information
Service is the elaboration of analytical overviews on global and
regional issues and of intelligence expertise in the processes of
defence and operational planning.

In the period until 202, the organizational build-up and
functioning of the Military Information Service will be performed
pursuant to the adopted Military Intelligence Act and the due to be
developed and adopted Rules of organization and operation of the
Military Information Service and other by-law acts.

The aim of the reorganization and modernization of the Military
Information Service will be the development of existing and
acquisition of new capabilities for strategic intelligence; reconnaissance data processing and analysis; fast and flexible redirection of
intelligence and analytical resources in the event of crises; effective
interaction with NATO and EU intelligence structures, the intelligence
bodies of NATO and EU member states and partner services;

   - **Military – Geographic Service**
The Military-Geographic Service (MGS) maintains and supports
capabilities aimed at providing geographic information/products
(maps, diagrams, terrain analysis, digital information on the locality
etc.) for the armed forces, state agencies and organizations.
The current structure and staff of the MGS does not allow for
the development of capabilities aimed at maintaining the geodesic and
cartographic fund; for introduction into operation of the system
providing public access to spatial data of the Ministry of Defence and
maintaining the system’s life cycle; for production, maintenance,
provision and protection of the integrity of digital geographic data. We
need highly qualified specialists able to fulfill tasks in the sphere of
geodesy, cartography, photometry and poligraphy.
In this line of thought, we plan to conduct organizational-staff
changes in the MGS, and on the basis of existing units we plan to
establish a new structure tasked to preserve the existing and develop
new capabilities related to maintaining geodesic and cartographic fund
and providing public access to the spatial data of the MoD (MGS)

The organizational structure of the military-educational system
will be preserved, and we will develop mechanisms aimed at assessing
the educational capabilities and projects with respect to their
implementation as well as provision of opportunities to acquire
complex aviation education.

**III.    Management, command and control**
**1.** **Management**
The management of the armed forces comprises a series of
activities and is a responsibility of the political and military-political
leadership of the country; it is expressed in their ability, right and
obligation to: establish, maintain and improve the legal base for the
development and operation of the armed forces; defining the defence
resources (human, material and financial resources); decision making
as to when, where and how the armed forces will be employed.
**2.** **Command and control**
The command and control system allows the Commanders/
Chiefs and their staffs to fulfill the tasks, resulting from the armed
forces’ missions.
The levels of command and control are a unity of management
units which hold identical places in the hierarchical makeup of the
management structure.
Three levels of command and control of the armed forces are
identified: strategic, operational and tactical.


28

### 28


**Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria**


-----

**Plan For The Development Of The Armed Forces Of The Republic Of Bulgaria 2020**


**The Strategic Level** of command and control includes the
President of the Republic, the Minister of Defence, and the Chief of
Defence supported by the Defence Staff, general and specialized
administration of the Ministry of Defence.
The Strategic level is responsible for the execution of the armed
forces’ tasks resulting from the missions assigned to them.
**The Operational level** of command and control includes the
Commander of the Joint Forces Command, the Commanders/Chiefs of
the Land Forces, Air Force and Navy supported by their staffs.
The operational level of command and control is responsible for
planning and conducting operations on the territory of the country and
outside its borders in definite spatial, time and resource frameworks
aimed at achieving the strategic goals. This level achieves the
connection between the tactical and the strategic level.
The Commander of the Joint Forces Command commands the
military units directly subordinated to him as well as the operational
command and control of the added military units of the armed forces
Services in conducting joint operations.
The Commander/Commanders of the Land Forces, Air Force
and Navy conduct command and control of the military units
subordinated to them. In conducting single-service operations, the
Commander/Commanders of the Services command and control the
tactical units subordinated to them. In case of joint operations, they
form staff elements of the Land Forces, Air Force and Navy
components tasked to control of the forces and means participating in
the joint operation.
The Commander of the Joint Forces Command and the
Commanders/Chiefs of the Land Forces, Air Force and Navy are
directly subordinated to the Chief of Defence.
**The Tactical Level** of command and control includes the
commanders (chiefs) supported by their staffs which conduct the
tactical command and control of the military units subordinated to
them, including:
    - Units of the Joint Forces Command;
    - Units of the Services;
    - Units the Special Forces Brigade;
    - Units of fixed CIS;
    - Units of the structures directly subordinated to the
Minister of Defence.


29

**Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria** **29**


-----

**Plan For The Development Of The Armed Forces Of The Republic Of Bulgaria 2020**


The tactical level of command and control of the armed forces
is responsible for conducting combat, combat support and combat
service support activities by units with the goal to fulfill the tasks
assigned to them.
The commanders of the fixed CIS and the Special Forces
Brigade are directly subordinated to the Chief of Defence.

**3.** **Command structure and Chain of command of the**
**armed forces**

_The command structure of the armed forces is a unity of_
structural elements forming a hierarchy. It defines division of rights in
the process of the command and control system’s operation, and is
expressed in the formal and informal connections and relations
between the command and control levels and units in their unity and
subordination.
The command structure of the armed forces includes the
Ministry of Defence, the Joint Forces Command, the Commands of the
Land Forces, Air Force and Navy, military units directly subordinated
to the Chief of Defence, and structures directly subordinated to the
Minister of Defence.
_The Chain of command of the armed forces is a component part_
of the command and control system which illustrates consistency and
order of subordination from the most senior to the most junior
commander/chief through which command and control is executed by
observing the principles of organizational subordination, integration,
undivided authority and hierarchy of the commanders’ and chiefs’
rights.

**IV.   Size of the armed forces and distribution of the**
**personnel under force structures**

The armed forces will maintain total size of not less 37 000 and
not more than 40 000. As a result of the profound reforms in the
defence system and personnel downsizing conducted during the years,
as of 2015 the size of the armed forces has reached a critical level
under which it will be impossible to fulfil some of the core tasks.
The non-fulfillment of the investment plans for modernization and the
slow rate of releasing of excess properties, assets, armaments,


30

### 30


**Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria**


-----

**Plan For The Development Of The Armed Forces Of The Republic Of Bulgaria 2020**


equipment and ammunitions do not allow further personnel
downsizing without losing major defence capabilities.
Through modernization and acquisition of new platforms of
armament and equipment, as well as in cases of releasing of excess
defence articles (material resources, infrastructure etc.), the size of the
armed forces will be decreased phase by phase from the upper
threshold to reach a level of not less than 37 000 personnel. Thus, the
expenses for the personnel’s subsistence will be decreased, and
through establishing new legal mechanisms, we will ensure that the
decreased expenses for the personnel will be reinvested in defence for
modernization and combat training.
The rapidly changing security environment and armed forces’
personnel downsizing as well as the limited financial defence
resources necessitated to upgrade and develop the vision for the
voluntary reserve of the military units. With a view to improving the
voluntary reserve’s operation, we envision making an analysis of the
vacant positions, and if necessary, to redistribute them among the
military units. We envision establishing individual voluntary reserve
structural units in the lists of positions of the military units with size
of detachments, platoons and companies, which will be responsible
for activities related to assisting and providing for the execution of the
tasks assigned to the military units. On the other hand, it becomes
necessary to increase the mobilization capabilities of the armed forces,
and in this line of thought, we envision for the voluntary reserve to be
treated as the core of forming the wartime units. The size of the
voluntary reserve of the armed forces of the Republic of Bulgaria by
2020 will be up to 3 000 reservists.
As of 31 December 2018, the correlation of the peacetime
personnel, without the voluntary reserve, under categories of
servicemen and civilian employees will be as follows:

####  servicemen/civilian employees – 78 percent/22 percent;
  categories of servicemen - officers/officer candidates/noncommissioned officers/soldiers – **23** percent/2 percent/28
percent/47 percent;


31

**Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria** **31**


-----

**Plan For The Development Of The Armed Forces Of The Republic Of Bulgaria 2020**



####  officers having ranks - Colonel/Lieutenant
Colonel/Major/junior officer ranks – **7 percent/13 percent/20**
percent/60 percent[3].
The relative share of the Bulgarian army’s size is as follows:

####  Joint Forces Command – 10,7 % of the Bulgarian army’s
personnel;

####  Land Forces – 46,2 % of the Bulgarian army’s personnel;
  Air Force – 23,1 % of the Bulgarian army’s personnel;
  Navy – 12,2 % of the Bulgarian army’s personnel;
  Structures directly subordinated to the Chief of Defence –       
**7,8 % of the Bulgarian army’s personnel.**
The rights and obligations of the citizens and of the leadership
bodies of the armed forces’ reserve, the public relations related to the
armed forces’ reserve, the service in the reserve, and the military
roster of Bulgarian citizens are arranged by the Law on reserve of the
armed forces of the Republic of Bulgaria.
As for wartime, the armed forces will be supplemented with
military units and structures in accordance with a decision made by
the National Assembly on defining the military units and structures for
supplementing the armed forces in wartime, and for defining the size
of the Reserve dated 25.10.2013 (Promulgated in State Gazette, Issue
96 dated 05.11.2013). The wartime units are manned with mandatory
reservists and mandatory reserve equipment in accordance with the
Law on reserve of the armed forces of the Republic of Bulgaria.

3 In the officers’ correlations with regard to ranks, the servicemen
of Military Information Service, Service Military Police, Defence
Academies and military schools of higher education are nor included.

**VI.   Logistic support**

The armed forces’ logistics will develop as a complex activity
aimed at building the physical component of the armed forces on the
basis of the scientific achievements and technologies with the goal to
ensure the provision of the troops and forces with the necessary means
and service activities for preparing and conducting operations and
peacetime activities. Logistics will be the component connecting the
capabilities of the national economy with the needs of the armed
forces.
The logistic support of the armed forces will be conducted
through optimal combination of the national economy’s resource
potential with the armed forces’ needs. We will use more actively the
capabilities of NATO Agencies and the opportunities related to


34

### 34


**Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria**


-----

**Plan For The Development Of The Armed Forces Of The Republic Of Bulgaria 2020**


participation in the Alliance’s and EU programs, projects and
initiatives as well as cooperation with Allies in bilateral or multilateral
format.
The limited financial defence resources and the joint nature of
the future operations direct the efforts towards building focused
logistics in the armed forces with a capability of providing the military
units with the required armament, equipment and material resources at
the precise point on the precise time with the exact quantity required
for the execution of the tasks assigned to them.
As a priority, we will develop logistic capabilities related to:

       - maintaining the required stocks of material resources,
their distribution and deliveries;

       - support and repairs of the core armament and
equipment;

       - movement and transportation;

       - support of the military infrastructure;

       - increasing mobility of the declared formations and
provision of timely and effective logistic support in as the operation
progresses;

       - providing military assistance in supporting the Republic
of Bulgaria as a host nation to allied forces and organizations;

     - modernizing the existing medical structures, optimizing
the interaction between them and the management of system for
military-medical support of the armed forces.

In accordance with the established management, command and
control levels of the armed forces, we build the logistic system at three
levels: strategic, operational and tactical.

The basic management body of the logistic support at strategic
level is Directorate Logistics to the Defence Staff. The directorate is a
body responsible for the preparation of military-expert assessments in
the sphere of logistics. The directorate assists the Minister of Defence
in formulating the policy on logistic support of the armed forces in the
framework of the processes of preliminary planning and crisis response
planning at strategic level.

The logistic support management in the Bulgarian army at
operational level is conducted by Logistics departments in the Joint
Forces Command and the Commands of the Services. The Logistics


35

**Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria** **35**


-----

**Plan For The Development Of The Armed Forces Of The Republic Of Bulgaria 2020**


departments in the Joint Forces Command, the Land Forces, Air Force
and Navy support the activities of the Commander of the Joint Forces
Command and the Commanders/Chiefs of the Services  in planning,
organization and management of all activities related to logistic
support of the military units subordinated to them.

At tactical level, directly subordinated to the Commander of the
Joint Forces Command and to the Commanders/Chiefs of the Land
Forces, Air Force and Navy, logistic units are built which have
capabilities ensuring the execution of the functions and tasks assigned
to them. In the military units of the Joint Forces Command and the
Services, executive logistic bodies and units are built in line with the
specificity of the functions and tasks fulfilled by these units.

The diagram of the armed forces’ logistic system is included as
an appendix to the Plan.

The changes in the security environment and the Alliance’s
increased requirements towards the Republic of Bulgaria with respect
to provision of Host Nation Support (HNS) for the Allied troops and
forces necessitate the establishment of new structural units at strategic
and operational levels tasked to coordinate the timely and high-quality
execution of the activities on providing military assistance as a
component part of the HNS, and at tactical level it is required to
maintain and build executive structures, having capabilities which
support these activities.

After restructuring the stocks and releasing (through disposal or
utilization) of the excess material resources, we will make changes at
tactical level. They will influence most profoundly Logistics Brigade,
which will be reorganized in the period 2016-2020 as a result of
releasing of excess capabilities and disbanding a part of the bases
subordinated to it. The deadlines for disbanding the military units are
in agreement with the actual execution of the activities on their
releasing of the excess material resources.

The logistic system management will be conducted by using
automated information system for exchanging logistic information and
logistic provision planning. In order to execute the activities related to
development, putting into practice and operation of the information
system “Logistics of the Bulgarian Army” in the Joint Forces

### 36


**Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria**


-----

**Plan For The Development Of The Armed Forces Of The Republic Of Bulgaria 2020**


Command, we are building a staff unit, directly subordinated to the
Commander of the Joint Forces Command, which is intended to
execute the functions and tasks of an Office to the system.

We will continue to maintain and develop the required medical
capabilities and structures in order to achieve the expected level of
medical support for the armed forces.

In order to implement effective medical support for the armed
forces, we have built a unified system, which includes medical support
planning bodies in the staffs at the three levels of the command and
control system of the armed forces and the Military Medical Academy
(MMA). The forces and means assigned to medical support are formed
on a mixed principle – of the MMA personnel and in the armed forces’
units.

The basic efforts for optimizing the medical support until 2020
are directed towards establishing new diagnostic, medical treatment
and evacuation capabilities both on the territory of the country and
during operations outside its borders.

**VII.   Communication Information Support**

The communication information system of the armed forces
provides for maintaining effective and reliable operation of the
command and control system through timely delivery of the required
information at the precise point in the whole spectrum of the armed
forces’ missions and tasks. It is composed of CIS control points; CIS
control bodies, and communication-information networks.

In order to provide for the planned resources assigned to
communication-information support, a series of structures function at
strategic, operational and tactical levels.

At strategic level, the CIS structure is responsible for planning
and provision of the resources for communication-information support
of the armed forces’ command and control system. This structure
defines the policies on building and development of CIS, provision of
services, protection of information, training and preparation of
personnel for the needs of CIS.


37

**Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria** **37**


-----

**Plan For The Development Of The Armed Forces Of The Republic Of Bulgaria 2020**


At strategic level, we will continue to maintain in a state of
readiness and develop CIS at fixed control points of the Supreme
Command. Operational centers of the integrated communication
information system tasked to conduct control over the country, will be
deployed at these points and will be kept in a state of readiness to
provide protected connectivity and ensure working conditions for the
operational groups of the state’s wartime command and control bodies.

The basic forces and means are concentrated in the Fixed CIS
which is subordinated to the Chief of Defence and provides
communication-information support for the command and control
system at strategic level as well as connectivity of the control points at
operational and tactical levels in the areas of combat employment.

The CIS structure at operational level plans and controls the
communication-information system in a joint operation’s preparation
and progress.

At operational level, the basic forces and means are concentrated
in the mobile CIS which is subordinated to the Commander of the Joint
Forces Command and fulfills tasks in its interest.

At tactical level, the basic forces and means are concentrated in
the CIS units which are subordinated the Commanders of Services, and
fulfill tasks in their interest.

The CIS bodies of the structures directly subordinated to the
Minister of Defence plan and build CIS for fulfillment of the basic
tasks, and if necessary, use resources of the Fixed CIS.

**VIII.   Education, science and training**

The military-educational system is built as a centralized
subsystem of the system for personnel preparation of the armed forces
of all categories of servicemen for the strategic, operational, and
tactical units, and it has at its disposal the required infrastructure,
buildings, academic staff, educational-material facilities and training
range facilities.

The elements of the military educational system are directly
subordinated to the Minister of Defence and include:

The efforts will be directed towards regulating the process and
methods of providing for and acquiring military training by Bulgarian
citizens on a voluntary principle. The training will be conducted by
following unified programs in the “Unified training center for initial
military training”.

In order to improve the system for selecting candidates for
military service as well as for service in the voluntary reserve, we
envision introducing a requirement for all Bulgarian citizens, willing to
participate in competitions, to have completed initial military training.

The preparation for acquiring special military training will be
conducted under the leadership of the Commanders of Services. The
persons appointed with a contract for military service or service in the
voluntary reserve have to complete special military training, and the
persons, willing to pass this special training on a voluntary principle,
will complete it at the request of the Central Office of Military
Districts.

We envision that in the period until 2020 we will undertake
activities on establishing a more effective approach and provision of
stimuli for the persons willing to receive military training on a
voluntary principle.

**IX.   Deployment and Infrastructure**

The organizational structures of the armed forces are deployed
in troops areas, in which elements of the defence infrastructure
(buildings, warehouses, workshops, garages as well as military
airports, naval ports, training ranges, educational centers, firing ranges
etc.) are located; the above elements service the everyday activities
and the combat training of the military units. Totally, the elements of
the core infrastructure include total unfolded built-up area (UBA) of
approximately 3 155 000 square meters.

In the progress of restructuring, by the end of 2020, the troops
areas will be decreased, which will lead to reducing the area of the
core infrastructure elements by approximately 50 550 square meters,
and to economy of financial means for repairs and maintenance.

The units subordinated to the **Joint Forces Command** are
dislocated in 42 troops areas.


41

**Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria** **41**

**Plan For The Development Of The Armed Forces Of The Republic Of Bulgaria 2020**


**The Land Forces** are deployed in 17 garrisons in which 70
troops areas and 7 garrison canteens are dislocated.

The available infrastructure of the Air Force is deployed in 77
troops areas and parts thereof, of which 31 are basic ones, while in the
remaining areas facilities supporting the troops’ activities are
dislocated (inner and outer markers, communication nods, electrical
sub-stations, pumping stations).

The infrastructure facilities of the **Navy are deployed in 42**
troops areas: 21 of them are barracks, 6 are warehouses, 2 are naval
ports, 1 is an airport, and 12 are of another type.

The Special Forces Brigade is deployed in 5 troops areas.

The defence infrastructure of the other structures (Service
Military Police, Military Information Service, the elements of the
educational system and the training centers) will not undergo
significant changes with respect to deployment and the unfolded
built-up area,

**X. Maintaining the existing and development of new**
**defence capabilities.**

In order to maintain modern and combat-efficient armed forces
and to implement the policy in the sphere of defence and security in
compliance with the process of NATO defence planning and the
process of building EU defence capabilities, we will maintain and
develop effective and efficient capability-based defence planning

We will continue to develop the Connected Training Initiative
and we will proceed with the implementation of a project with NATO
common funding on connecting the joint facilities at Novo Selo
training range with the training ranges Hohenfels and Graffenwoeher,
Germany, and Bydgoszcz, (Poland).
We will continue to develop  a unified training plan on using
the Joint facilities on the territory of the Republic of Bulgaria including
training with the participation of NATO member countries and partner
countries, and transition from bilateral to multilateral exercises,
preparations and trainings.
We will continue our participation in the NATO Connected

the group of countries with Germany as Framework Nation, and to the
command in Szczecin, Poland, as basic for Eastern Europe.
**Strategic** **deployment** – requires strategic deployment
capabilities in a zone designated for joint operations. We will continue
our country’s membership in the NATO strategic airlift capability
program C-17 and in the Multinational Sealift Coordination Center
through which we will meet the requirements for strategic deployment
capabilities in a zone designated for joint operations.
**Combat effectiveness –** requires capabilities for effective
combat impact (direct or indirect) on the enemy by application of
physical or cognitive effects through a combination of joint maneuver
and fire power, and when appropriate, through other operational
methods, measures and mechanisms of imposing our will upon the
adversary.
In order to meet the requirements in this sphere, the major
contribution will be the acquisition of a new armored fighting vehicle
furnished with appropriate equipment, the training of and equipment
for three battalion battle groups in the mechanized brigades; the
acquisition of new fighter aircraft and integrated support provided for
it; acquisition of a module patrol ship and modernization of navy ship
platforms by equipping these with anti-ship complex, air defence
system and torpedo armament, 3D radar, a remote controlled drone and
combat information system.

conducting activities aimed at maintaining the fighting efficiency of
the troops and forces, including movement and transportation,
engineering support, medical support, delivery management, support
and servicing of armament, combat equipment and material means.
We will continue our participation in the NATO Multinational
Integrated Logistic Unit.
**Command,** **Control** **and** **Communications** – require
capabilities ensuring effective command, control as well as control
over the troops and forces for the execution of the tasks assigned to
them.
We will build the capabilities in the sphere of communicationinformation systems (CIS), navigation and cyber defence systems. A
priority will be the development of the Center for surveillance,

defence”, parallel to the development of the automated information
system as well as adaptation of the field control systems within the
framework of NATO Federated Mission Networking (FMN).
We will continue to develop the Joint facilities infrastructure,
including through financing by NATO common funds. A priority will
be the building, development and improvement of the road
infrastructure, maneuver training ranges, live fire, and training of
mechanized, tank and artillery units;  a permanent warehouse for
ammunition storage (for Novo Selo training range), airstrips, service
facilities and facilities for aviation equipment repairs (for the airports
Bezmer and Graf Ignatievo).

**Protection and mobility – require capabilities for protection of**
personnel, facilities, equipment, installations, and activities under
threat of all nature and in all situations with the goal to ensure freedom
of operation and contribution to the operation’s success.
Through the execution of Capability Targets 2013 in the sphere
of surface-based air defence, cyber defence, means for anti-mine
warfare, we will meet the requirements for protection of the personnel,
facilities, equipment and activities against threats of any nature. The
substitution of the surface-based air defence means will be
implemented through NATO and EU multinational projects at a pace
dependent on the available means.
**Information provision –** requires capabilities for information
support and provision of timely, expedient and accurate reconnaissance
information.
We envision achieving an increase in the capabilities in this
sphere through modernization of the surveillance systems by acquiring
4-6 3D radars.
We will continue our country’s participation in the NATO
Alliance Ground Surveillance Initiative. Building capabilities for joint
reconnaissance, system surveillance, and active reconnaissance will
contribute to meeting the requirements in their entirety.
In long-term perspective,  it will be necessary to acquire key
capabilities for modern operations: aerial reconnaissance and
surveillance; building and maintenance of common operational picture;
communication-information support; mobile logistics; operations in
urban environment, night operations and operations under extreme
climatic conditions; critical infrastructure protection.

**Plan For The Development Of The Armed Forces Of The Republic Of Bulgaria 2020**


**XI.   Resource provision**

According to the “Program for the development of defence
capabilities of the Bulgarian armed forces 2020” adopted by the
National Assembly, the basic source for financing the armed forces’
defence capabilities is the state budget and, respectively, the Budget of
the Ministry of Defence (MoD).

The financial provision of the activities in the Plan for the
development of the armed forces of the Republic of Bulgaria 2020 is
in line with the two stages in the implementation of the Plan.

**First stage**
The financial macro-frame on the execution of the first stage of
the armed forces’ building and development is in accordance with the
Law on the state budget of the Republic of Bulgaria and the updated
medium-term budget forecast for the period 2016-2018 (Decision of
the Council of Ministers № 847/ dated 30.10.2015).
The financial means allocated to the Ministry of Defence during
the First Stage are as follows:

**- 2016.**
The budget of the MoD for 2016 (including the means from the
central budget and the transfer allocated to the state funded military
schools of higher education) amounts to 1 187 173 thousand Levs
which constitutes 1.35 % of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The
budget allows for appointing servicemen in order to reach the
personnel roster as of 01.07.2015 – as a priority in the declared
military units and launching investment projects which require
considerable financial resources.

**- 2017.**
The defined ceiling on expenses for the MoD (including the
means from the central budget and the transfer allocated to the state
funded military schools of higher education) amounts to 1 172 548
thousand Levs which constitutes 1.28 % of GDP. In order to reach
1.35% of GDP, it is necessary to increase the ceiling on expenses for
the MoD by 55 000 thousand Levs which will allow for appointing
500 servicemen to vacant positions, and will reflect the planned
increase in the minimum pay, acceleration of the processes related to
utilization of excess ammunitions and provision of a level of training
for the declared units in accordance with NATO standards.


46

### 46


**Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria**


-----

**Plan For The Development Of The Armed Forces Of The Republic Of Bulgaria 2020**


We continue the execution of investment projects for the
acquisition of new fighter aircraft, multifunctional module patrol ship
and wheeled armored fighting vehicles.

**- 2018.**
The defined ceiling of expenses for the MoD (including the
means from the central budget and the transfer allocated to the state
funded military schools of higher education) amounts to 1 214 323
thousand Levs which constitutes 1.28 % of GDP. In order to reach
1.35% of GDP, it is necessary to increase the ceiling on expenses for
the MoD by 64 000 thousand Levs which will allow for appointing
800 servicemen to vacant positions in order to decrease the
insufficient level of manning; to continue the processes related to
utilization of excess ammunitions and preserve the level of training of
the declared units in accordance with NATO standards.
We will continue the implementation of the investment projects
for acquisition of new fighter aircraft, multifunctional module patrol
ship and wheeled armored fighting vehicles.

**Second Stage**

The budget of the MoD is envisaged to rise to 1.5% of the
GDP in the period 2019-2020, which is the value used in the planning
assumptions. In line with the decisions made at the 2014 NATO
Summit in Wales, the MoD budget is expected to gradually reach 2%
of the GDP by 2024. Such financial resources will for the scheduled
filling of vacancies until the planned number of personnel of the
designated structures, as laid down in the endorsed establishment plan,
is reached (incl. the standing reserve).

Towards the end of the second stage, the objective to which
we should aspire is attaining a ratio of personnel costs to ongoing
subsistence to capital expenditure of 60:20:20, which corresponds to
the average for EU countries.

The share of the capital expenditure is set at 20% of the total
budgetary expenditure and allows for the implementation of
investment projects launched during the first stage, as well as for the
launching of further priority investment projects included in the
Project Portfolio. This will result in reducing the armed forces’
dependency on non-NATO and non-EU countries.

During the period 2019-2020, the estimated financial resources
will provide for the functioning of the armed forces and the execution
of the missions and tasks assigned to them, and will create
opportunities to pursue income policy, conduct training, take the
modernization process further, and acquire new armaments and
equipment.
