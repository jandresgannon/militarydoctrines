##### National security and contribution to global security *

he program for defence and national security will continue to embody the
standards and principles of the North Atlantic Alliance. Among its core values,
national security constitutes the foundation for a democratic development and

# Ta genuine economic growth of the country.

The reform of the armed forces, in line with NATO standards, will aim to increase
the level of professionalism, depoliticization, dignity and integrity, by transforming
it into an active force in the country’s service and a dignified force for the standards
of the Alliance’s member countries.

Key steps for meeting these objectives will commence with the institutional
commitment to the preparation of the National Strategy Document. Not reviewed
since 2004, this important document will be drafted in accordance with the new
security environment, and based on the “New Strategic Concept” of Alliance, 2010.
After the approval in Parliament, the government will prepare a new document Military
Strategy to realize the conformity of the national level ambitions, with financial
resources in the field of defence, provided already in the Strategic Defence Review
document.

Government will enable a deep reform in the Armed Forces in doctrinal, conceptual
and structural terms, in order to enhance professionalism, to depoliticize the structures
and to strengthen the fight against corruption.

A solid platform will be prepared to increase cooperation with NATO member and
partner countries, in order to provide their greater support in meeting the required
standards and the implementation of our contribution to collective defence and
peacekeeping missions led by the Alliance.

Government will draft a Medium-term and Long term Development plan of the Armed
Forces for the period 2013-2020. The aim of the formulation and implementation of
long-term development plan will be:

-  Establishing a new organizational structure of the Armed Forces, by gradually
reducing the current personnel number;

-  Excerpt from the Government Program 2013-2017, “Alliance of European Albania”, on Defence,
Tirana 2013.


-----

-  Review the entire system of education and training of the Armed Forces, in
order to prepare professional soldiers, NCOs, and staff officer corps of the
Armed Forces, in accordance with the new needs of the force structure.

Attainment of the operational readiness group of the Mechanized Infantry Battalion
and Special Operations Land Forces Group will be of priority, thereby fulfilling its
obligations to NATO’s military capabilities, required for collective defence and
peacekeeping operations.

We will review the legal framework that regulates the activity of the Armed Forces.
At the core of this review will be the improvement of the status of Military, restoration
of the trampled dignity and increase of their confidence in the state.

Review of the legal framework for improving the financial treatment of active military
is a necessity for keeping and attracting quality human resources in the Armed Forces
for the future, but also for decent treatment of the retired and reserve military.

##### Incarnation of Strategic Partnership with USA in NATO front *

Edi Rama

Prime Minister of Albania


n this environment, where more than elsewhere, strict application of the rule is a
fundamental part of the work and discipline is the first condition for the realization
of its major objective, the protection of life of citizens and our common Fatherland,

# II had no desire at all to break the rule, even the basic one, the protocol procedures.

But in my first visit in the Ministry of Defence and the General Staff of the as Prime
Minister, above all I want to honour the work, efforts and sacrifices of our soldiers
and along with that, undoubtedly and inseparably, the work and the high sense of
responsibility of everyone in the chain of command of the Armed Forces who has
done his best for Albania in NATO.

Armed Forces are an indispensable bridge that inextricably links our country with
NATO. Through this bridge, Albania has joined its future destiny, today’s weapons
and blood of the youngest generation with the alliance of countries that make up
their daily lives on the priceless values of peace, freedom and democracy.

I feel obliged to highlight from this square that freedom, peace and security that
Albania enjoys today, as a NATO country, are neither given once and forever nor are
they natural benefits like the sun, water or air. Nowadays they stand on the basis of
the road for every NATO country, thanks to a dignified service from the military
people, who with their dedication and discipline serve to peace and freedom, not
only at home, but also in the battle fronts far from their country.

The Albanian people owe gratitude to each of you. On the other hand, the Albanian
government owes to each of you its full attention and support, on behalf of Albania
and of every Albanian.

Selection of the New Chief of Staff, who I have the honour to greet today in front of
you, is carried out with a special care, in order to give you the most comprehensive

*Speech delivered at the Training and Doctrine Command, on the occasion of the presentation of the
new Chief of General Staff of the Armed Forces, Major General J. Bazo.

_Incarnation of Strategic Partnership with USA in NATO front_

support, and through his figure guarantee you a leadership of high professionalism
and integrity.

I believe that General Jeronim Bazo, with his good values, completed education,
long experience and salient dedication that characterizes his career, without any doubt,
will accomplish this new task in the best way. He will be a crucial collaborator in the
further transformation of the Armed Forces and an infallible interpreter of the major
role of these forces in the joint front of NATO battle for a better and more secure
world.

Our government gives special prominence to the strategic partnership with the United
States. Incarnation of this partnership in NATO front, from the trenches of Iraq and
Afghanistan, to the attempt to disarm without war the murderous regime in Syria is
not only inalienable obligation, but also a source of pride for us Albanians. Therefore,
we will never and for whatever reason forget that through this partnership and above
all, thanks to the United States, as a friend and the biggest ally of Albanians, Albanians
are better off today than ever before, wherever they live in our region. But, at the
same time, our government pays special attention to efficiently and rapidly advancing
of the overall reform in the Armed Forces, which, in compliance with the
recommendations of Strategic Review of Defence, will include the organizational
restructuring, education system, education and training of the Armed Forces,
enhancement of efficiency and operational capacities in dealing with civil
emergencies; qualitative accomplishment of our obligations in the framework of
collective defence embodied in the objectives of capacity building.

Having a clear view of the inherent problems and being aware of current difficulties
the country is undergoing, the Government will make every effort to create the
necessary conditions for the AF to successfully perform this profound process of
reforms. Through a wide and deep program, we will review some of the key strategic
documents of the country and the Armed Forces, and will modernize the legal basis
of the Armed Forces. The purpose of this process, of this ongoing comprehensive
reform will be raising the Armed Forces at the level of expectations of the Albanian
people and NATO alliance.

Albania not only needs a thoroughly modern force, but it can and will have such a
force. Manifestations of corruption at the highest level of leadership or other
shortcomings identified to date belong to the past.

We will try hard to meet the high obligations we have toward allies, we will make
efforts to raise the social usefulness of AF at a higher level.

The government will create the possibilities for the Armed Forces to rise at a higher
level of professionalism and readiness so that they take over possible a broader range
of obligations for the benefit of the citizens of this country, as in the cases of
emergencies or disasters, as well other necessary services for the public good.

While speaking about the future work and obligations in the following years, I cannot
forget to greet the Armed Forces for what they have achieved so far, in co-operation
with previous governments. Making use of the opportunity I would like to underline
not only the ISAF operation in Afghanistan, led by NATO, but also the operations

led by KFOR in Kosovo or ALTEA operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, led by
EU.

Our country is firmly entering the path of a comprehensive renovation, which certainly
is not easy, but we will carry every kind of weight, we will face every kind of difficulty
and we will rely on each friend and partner given that it can be achieved. Fortunately,
we are not alone. We are a member of a family of values  and large capacities, the
Euro-Atlantic family. Our being part of this family, facilitates the carrying of this
great burden of the necessary change that we should and will bring together.

There is no doubt that the Armed Forces will be one of the bastions of success for the
versatile modernization of Albania, which thanks to these forces, will continuously
be a process of active participation in every effort of the Euro-Atlantic family for a
better and more secure world.

Your profession is the profession of honour. If for many other groups of occupations,
honour is a high and required virtue, for the military it is part of the job description.
If certain crafts have honour as something required, for the military honour is the
profession itself. It is that criterion and force that motivates the military to serve with
sacrifices that know no limits and who often surprise everyone else by going beyond
limits.

To establish and maintain an army relying on honour, at least two conditions should
be met. First, the military itself should place the code of honour in its flag. It should
make every effort to recruit those citizens of this country who consider honour as
something sacred and further, it must ensure the conditions that honour remains the
highest norm that regulates the military life in the Armed Forces. Second, the society
itself should always appraise as higher as possible its army by highly respecting the
members of the Armed Forces.

Albania’s government will make all its efforts to treat Armed Forces with the deserved
honour. Our army will definitely have the deserved uniforms, a decent financial
treatment, the necessary equipment and systems to successfully fulfil its high mission
in a constant way. We will make every effort that the fair and equal treatment of the
military people, equal opportunities for education and training, equal opportunities
for a fair career based on merit, become a tangible reality for every member of the
Armed Forces.

Appointment of the new Chief of Staff based on these values and principles, is the
first signal that we are giving to all members of the Armed Forces for the unwavering
will that the hierarchy in the Armed Forces should be constituted on merit and only
on merit of each member of these forces.

The Armed Forces of our country do not represent only military organization that
consists of the active military of this country. A very big army, even bigger, of military
people in reserve and veterans, naturally identify themselves with the Armed Forces.
This honourable community of patriots and professionals deserves much more
attention and esteem from state and society, not only for what they have given to this
country, but also for the sake of what they can and should contribute for the country
in the future.


-----

_Incarnation of Strategic Partnership with USA in NATO front_

Their professionalism, patriotism and readiness represent a tremendous potential,
which can and must put at the service of our country and society. We are determined
to do the utmost to achieve this.

The government will take all the necessary steps to institutionalize and create the
necessary legal and organizational mechanisms that will enable a greater contribution
of the retired military and veterans for the benefit of the country’s Armed Forces.

Let’s work together to create a new synergy for the Armed Forces, defence and security
of the country, as well as our contribution to regional security and beyond, being
convinced that success is in the hands of each of us. As of today, and here, more than
in any other place everyone should feel and convey the limitless devotion to Albania.

_Mimi Kodheli, Minister of Defence_


##### National Security Policy for the Review of the
 Strategic Defence *


Mimi Kodheli

Minister of Defence

**anusz Bugajski:** How would you summarize the Albania’s national security

policy? In other words, very basically, what are the threats, the challenges, the
forced postures and capabilities?

# J

**Minister Kodheli: Albania became a NATO member in April 2009 and this event**
marks our history the same as it marks our future. This event constitutes a fundamental
shift from an individual defence and security strategy to a collective strategy. We
used to have a big army in the area of communism, large properties, a great number
compared to number of inhabitants, and a huge amount of surplus ammunitions.
This affects the way the Albanian army would like to be transformed and is going to
be transformed, by respecting and meeting the NATO obligations, NATO strategy
and by fulfilling our national security strategy, the security of our country, protection
policy of our civilians, our heritage, and of course, the way we are supporting the
Balkans countries to be part of NATO. As you know, only Croatia is a member at this
moment, and of course we support Kosovo in having another way of transforming
through the same path of becoming a NATO and EU member, and altogether have a
safe, secure and democratic region, and why not a global one.

We are a NATO member today and we have lot of obligations to fulfil. We have
already combat troops in Afghanistan as part of the ISAF program and we are going
to support the Afghan security forces to defend their weak democracy and their citizens
in the nearest future. We have been earlier just supporters to the combat brigades or
battalions, now we are in the first front line and later on, we, as Albanian troops, will
support the Afghan security forces. These are very good steps, through a more efficient,
well-prepared and professional army, as the Albanian army would like to be in the
nearest future. We have some special troops, we have done modernizations and we
are trying to depoliticize the army, but this process is not something we can do just

_National Security Policy for the Review of the Strategic Defence_

like this. The Ministry of Defence under the Rama Government is going to work on
different directions to make things function better, and to assure that the Albanian
citizens can be protected more than before, that they can and be supported and in this
case, the democracy and the rule of law can function better, and the future of their
children can be a better one. Ministry of Defence and the Albanian Government
policies are part of this context. We have to lead this process.

**Janusz Bugajski:** I wanted to go on to the bigger NATO question including post
Afghanistan in a few minutes but let me ask you specifically about the Strategic
Defence Review that was concluded last year. The next plan is of course the plan of
implementation by the Defence Ministry. What is the plan, and I suppose very
important is how it would be affected by the defence budget. The financial situation
as you know in your government case is not very healthy. How would this affect the
implementation of the Defence Strategy?

**Minister Kodheli: The SDR was approved in Parliament this year. This is a very**
strategic paper and based on it we are going to build our national defence strategy.
But of course, we need some money to implement it, and this is not the best of the
periods financially speaking. On the contrary! I am an economist and finance by
background, so I know what I am talking about more than other people do. Yes! We
have found one of the worst scenarios Albania has ever been in the last two decades.

The worst one was in the year 1997 during the pyramid schemes, and the other one I
think is this one. I have seen the data, and at the end of the year we are going to have
less and less revenue, from 25.3 % of the GDP, to 23.8, and this is a big amount of
money. This means that we will have cuts all around and this will affect the Ministry
of Defence, but not for that we are going to fulfil the NATO obligations and the
important thing is to have good ratios when we are preparing budget, personnel
obligations in salaries and payments, implementations of maintenance and operations,
and other expenditures, and for sure we will help the Albanian army and the Ministry
of Defence to fulfil and to fully respect the Strategic Defence Review which is a very
important aspect not only of military politics, but of foreign policy as well. We will
try hard to cut expenditures which we don’t need in order to use in an efficient way
the money we have. The last but not least, on the contrary, it is the most important, to
fight corruption.

**Janusz Bugajski: I was going to ask you about this.**

**Minister Kodheli: We are fully involved in this budgeting period. Thanks God I do**
have some very good colleagues who are very good experts on that, and me myself,
which is not necessary a ministers’ duty, but I am going to check it myself, because
of all these reasons, which I was trying to explain. This is very important, because
we need to meet some obligations, and one of them is that our troops has to be
modernized, has to be supported and modernized, and should be supported with
modern equipment, and I am talking about troops who in general are prepared to go
to Afghanistan, but who are going to other peacekeeping missions as well.

**Janusz Bugajski: They have to be improved into interoperable troops.**

**Minister Kodheli: Of course. So we need to be in the same level, to have the same**

12

_Mimi Kodheli, Minister of Defence_

preparation, equipment and all the stuff that they need. There is some expenditure
that we have to do, but we can do it to the best of our ways. We are here to do that,
because people gave us their vote to do it in a better way and this is one of the things
that we are going to show to them. With less money we can make it.

**Janusz Bugajski:** Europe and America face the same problem. Less budget more
streamlining, more efficient defence ministries and military network. Albania is not
alone in this struggle I suppose. Let me ask you specifically, when you were in
opposition, the Socialists criticized the then Defence Minister on questions of
corruption on military property transfers and so on. There was one specific question
which was the Central Army House which was given to the Democratic Party after
the elections. What’s going to happen with such questions as this one I mentioned?

**Minister Kodheli: Well, as I mentioned, before, the army owned many properties**
before, and some were in very nice places, or in delicate strategic parts of Albania
and also in the centre of Tirana. We had a very big discussion when we were in
opposition, not only how these properties were treated, but on all the corruption
process, when they were given as gifts or they were sold out, or when they were put
in auction. So it is going to be a big discussion, and we are going to check one by one
all the cases certainly by auditing and inspecting them, and at the end of the story, I
am sure that transparency can happen nowadays. We will show people, we will show
citizens that their properties, since they are common properties, are used by the right
persons or by the wrong persons, are sold in the right way or in the wrong way, they
if they are donated or are they sold, if they are considered as common properties or
as properties of the government which is a big difference, if the properties are ours
or they belong to the government. They always have to be ours.

So you have to be really transparent when you move the ownership from one side to
the other side, and in this specific case. In principle, I am not against the fact that a
common property will go from Ministry of Defence to another public organization
which is the case of a party. The problem is procedures. The problem is transparency.
So this is the most important thing. If there are no procedures, if there is no
transparency, if there is no law enforcing these procedures, if everything is against
law, illegal, we do have a big problem. And we had big discussion, even before I
went to the office, it was focused on this. Why did they have to have such big walls
between themselves and the public, between themselves and the media, between
themselves and the people who are interested to know that these properties are not
sold out as pieces of cakes, or that they are not sold for very personal interest but are
sold for common interest, which in the end of the day is where we have to focus on,
the common interest.

**Janusz Bugajski:** Allow me to ask you a related question on corruption which is
politicization. Would you say that the Albanian army is wholly depoliticized according
to NATO standards?

**Minister Kodheli: Not at all. On the contrary.**

**Janusz Bugajski: Could you explain?**

**Minister Kodheli: Look, we would need more than an hour to elaborate, but I will**

13


-----

_National Security Policy for the Review of the Strategic Defence_

try to be brief. In the Armed Forces (AF) and Ministry of Defence there was lot of
pressure regarding the fact that “if you don’t vote for Democratic Party (DP), you
are not like us”. It can’t be like this. We will stop this once and for all. Army is army.
It exists to defend the integrity of Albania, to defend democracy of Albania, to defend
the property of the citizens, to defend everything; this is for the best of our future. So
it is not there to show if they have voted SP or DP or other parties.

There is a lot of corruption not only when we discuss about properties or when we
discuss on tenders or auctions or any economic activity that the Ministry of Defence
has inside of it, but also when we talk careers which is another topic that we are
going to face I am still facing even nowadays. Just to say one, my predecessor, put
some more stars in the shoulders of some generals or colonels of the Albanian Army
in the month of May, one month before the elections, and by law the process had to
finish in September.

**Janusz Bugajski: In the previous September.**

**Minister Kodheli: No, in this September. So they just hurried up to put some more**
stars in somebody’s career, just to have some more votes because I can’t find any
other reason. And this is not the only thing that I am facing with. There are too many
things. There is a big “but” in this case. Lucky us to have within the Albanian Army
and in the Ministry of Defence even professionals and good people who respect the
law, the constitution and of all the procedures. So in this case there are still some
well-prepared civil servants or military people that maintain as they have to, the
Albanian Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defence.

In this case I hope it will not be easy but there is lot of work to be done. Something
that I have to mention is the fact that corruption has affected the Intelligence Service
as well, and very negatively. There are confidential relations between the intelligence
service within the NATO members and if someone outside learns that there is lot of
corruption over there, then there might be a very dangerous and big problem. Thus
the agency that is dealing with the Intelligence Services within the Ministry of Defence
is to be reorganized and restructured according to the NATO standards and fighting
corruption will become a much better and affective service.

**Janusz Bugajski: You have a lot on your plate during over the next term in office.**
Let me turn now to the NATO question. You mentioned already Albania’s role in
Afghanistan and the plans after making the withdrawal.

**Minister Kodheli: Yes in 2014.**

**Janusz Bugajski: Exactly in the next year. Could you sort of give us an overview of**
what’s Albania’s contribution to the Alliance, including Afghanistan but also in other
missions and in other combat theatres.

**Minister Kodheli:** We are a modest army, but during these years we served with
5.000 troops all around the world. It is a big number compared with the number of
the army we have, compared with the number of citizens!

**Janusz Bugajski:** Even some older NATO members contribute proportionally the
same as you.

_Mimi Kodheli, Minister of Defence_

**Minister Kodheli: There is more than that. Our troops are among the best troops**
that have been in the front over there. So this is now good news for us. But not the
only one, we have been in peacekeeping mission as well and combating in the first
line of front and of course we have lot of thing to do, otherwise try to improve our
strategy within the NATO strategy. Something that is very important and I would
like to stress is that role of Albania in general, politically speaking and role of Albanian
Army in Balkans is a very important role. We are trying to support countries which
would like to be part of NATO in the future, such as Montenegro, Macedonia or
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and of course to support the new path that Brussels opened
with the agreement between Serbia and Kosovo, which undoubtedly will open new
perspectives for the region in general, and a new perspective for all of us. Because
we know our target and our target are EU and Euro-Atlantic structures.

All of us have to work together and Albania is a big help and a big support of all the
countries which are not yet in NATO, but all the countries have to be a big support
for Albania in the walking in the EU path. The region now is safer, and we have to
take advantage of this situation, something that would help us a lot, all of us. This is
very important because we have e very constructive role as Albanians in the region.
This is a very important role. It is going to be a much bigger support within NATO,
so I think that strategically speaking, this is very important for all of us, and of
course we have to meet all the NATO obligations that we do have as a NATO member.
But of course in the say way we have to force the function of democracy within our
country and which will help us having a safer country, more foreign investors coming
to Albania, more prosperity and having better economic results, which in this period
of financial crises is really one of the biggest issues we are facing.

**Janusz Bugajski:** Right. You mentioned Albania’s neighbourhood, and let’s stick
now to the next NATO Summit in London in 2014, which should be an enlarging
summit. There are many conferences, many debates over this question Do you believe
that any country has been qualified for the next country if there was to be a next
round in the next Summit?

**Minister Kodheli: Well, look at my country. My country is a wonderful example of**
how a small country can be a NATO member. The agenda of the summit hasn’t been
published yet, but there are lots of opportunities that other countries can be part of
NATO. I think that in the London Summit we are going to discuss the successes that
the NATO members have achieved already, the position of the NATO members in
Afghanistan, because a mission is going to end.

**Janusz Bugajski: The mission is going to end.**

**Minister Kodheli: Yes. Another one is going to start. I think that this is going to be**
one of the discussions and of course why not enlargement! NATO has the “opened
door policy”, all of us, but of course other nations have to face with the strong
requirements of NATO as well. These strong requirements need to be fully fulfilled,
otherwise I see enlargement as a question that is going to be postponed.

**Janusz Bugajski: But enlargement has been a big impetus of NATO in the past 20**
years, particularly for the Central European and the Balkan states. In terms of

15

_National Security Policy for the Review of the Strategic Defence_

qualifying for NATO, would you say that Montenegro and Macedonia and the others
are qualified to enter? Do they now have the level that Albania had when it was
invited?

**Minister Kodheli: Good question. I don’t know if my answer is going to be a good**
one, but what I know for sure is the fact that, yes, maybe they have fulfilled most of
the NATO requirements, but there are some political questions that are involved in
this process. Macedonia has the problem of the name. Montenegro has some other
political problems which are involved in their NATO path. After solving them, I am
pretty sure that they are going to be part of NATO. That’s for sure. So it’s not only a
question of the technical issues to be resolved, but political ones as well. That’s why
Balkans is now living in a very safe environment but not in the environment we
would like to have. Without solving some problems between us, I don’t think that
this will be an easy task to be reached.

**Janusz Bugajski: Right. You know that there is a big debate both, in Washington**
and in Europe about the future of NATO. What is the purpose of the Alliance after
the most troops come home after completing the Afghan mission, the question of
how successful and how out of the area should NATO be, should it focus more on its
core mission or in other words mutual defence? What is your viewpoint? What is the
future of NATO?

**Minister Kodheli: Well, the threats to democracy have changed their face. Now we**
can still discuss the missile defence or chemical weapons of mass destruction, cyber
security, energy security, terrorism and all this kinds of threats which change
dimensions, their nature, the ways they are threatening our democracies, the weak
and the strong ones. I think that NATO has to be prepared for these new changes,
these new threats. Hence, NATO will be still there working and focusing on these
issues, as far as these threats are going to exist. NATO members and NATO itself as
an organization has to be prepared and prepare civilians and military troops for a
good defence. This is very important for all of us.

**Janusz Bugajski: Going back to the enlargement question, I think this is linked with**
what you are saying. The initial mission of the transatlantic strategic relationship
after the Cold War was to make Europe whole, free and in peace. Europe is not yet
whole, free and in peace, there are parts of the puzzle not only in the Balkans but also
in the Eastern Europe which haven’t been included either in NATO or in the European
Union. How do you see this? I mean is Albania the Albanian Government is committed
to include all the European states once they qualify, including Ukraine, Georgia and
other countries.

**Minister Kodheli: Why not? I think it’s good. We will play our small and intensive**
part, in trying to have more nations and states included in this big organization which
is build up since the beginning as you said, since the creation of the Atlantic Treaty
in the distant 1949, as an organization to keep peace, security and prosperity for
democratic countries. This is very important; to Europe this is particularly important.
I think that many of the countries are well-prepared to make steps in the right direction.
Of course there are some political issues that we have to face on this path, and one of
them of course is the former Soviet Union countries which have their own scenarios

and their own environment in that part of the world. I would be happy to have more
and more countries within the NATO, countries having the capacities. This might be
an easy way to combat threats whenever they will emerge. This is good. I think this
is good.

**Janusz Bugajski: Do you think NATO should intervene?**

**Minister Kodheli: I think that the first step was a good one. So moving chemical**
mass destruction weapons from the places where they are so that nobody has a chance
to use them, it’s a good step. It’s the first step, a weak one but it’s a very good one.
Then we’ll see.

**Janusz Bugajski: Well there is a whole question if NATO or a part of NATO within**
the Alliance should be involved in civil wars, in active democracy promotion which
is called in some parts of the world. What is the Albania’s position?

**Minister Kodheli: If we are fighting for democracy, we have to do it. They way you**
do it might be different in different places and different times, but fighting for
democracy its worth. Because democracy means lot of things: it means security for
the future, means good economy and prosperity for all of us. I am for democracy.
The way we are going to find one country’s democracy or one country’s safeness, it
depends. So in this case, as I mentioned, it would be a good thing to destroy all kind
of chemical weapons, Secondly, we are going to sit and discuss, and maybe find
another solution without having a military intervention. This most probably is going
to be a good way of doing things. We will see. It depends on the reaction of the Assad
Government and not only. Other international factors influence as well.

**Janusz Bugajski: Part of the picture in these countries I would say is now black and**
white, good guys against bad guys; it is not that all of the Assad opponents are model
democrats even new democrats. Some of them let us say are authoritarian Islamists,
even fascists within the rebel movement. So the question is that innocent people
have been murdered. How does NATO intervene or how diplomatically or in other
ways, how to rule democrats and prevent civilian slaughters. This is the key issue.

**Minister Kodheli: Well, the situation over there is a little bit a complicated one. The**
problem is that if the democracy is not functional in a country, and if somebody who
is leading the country is acting like a dictator, then somebody has to show him that
he has to act differently. This is the point. Of course there are different ways of
showing it. There are different ways how you can deal with it and can commit, and
make agreements with this regime. The best way is to talk to them, and let them
understand, that maybe it’s time for Syria to have some free elections, to have some
more space for pluralism and of course now it’s time to stop killing their own people,
by using violence against its population and not only. It is time to stop and to show
that Syria can make it with the help of NATO of course, and with the help of UN and
all the international factors.

**Janusz Bugajski: The most important thing is certainly not to be tied with only the**
chemical weapons, because many more civilians are killed in the conventional
weapons. I think we shouldn’t submit over a long a period of time presumably the
chemical weapons ask for. I personally believe that Russia is protecting this regime

17

_National Security Policy for the Review of the Strategic Defence_

and will continue to do so. This is just a tactic to maintain Assad in power. In terms
of the Albania’s policy presumably you look at the case to case if there are futures
conflicts are there any other conflict where NATO should intervene?

**Minister Kodheli: Yes of course, but in any case this is part of the political situation,**
which might change because of many international events. The Magreb country
revolutions have affected our foreign politics and of course the decisions that we
make under the NATO decisions. This is a lesson learned for us. It is a big lesson.
Things can change dramatically just like this. Thus we need to be prepared. This is
very important since Albania is part of the Mediterranean area. We need to have a
careful action in all kinds of fields, in the political field in foreign affairs discussions
in political and military issues. Certainly by joining the NATO decisions and offers
help in all kinds of actions NATO is going to deal with.

Being a small country, we are a very good catalyst of what’s happening all around.
Albania, due to its geographical and strategic position is just in the border of East
and West. We always have been like this. This is good for us because it makes us feel
citizens of the world, part of Europe but not only. We have been part of many empires
in the history; Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman, the Soviet and Chinese, and now we are
part of the western democracies. Even we have a fragile democracy within our country,
we have to look forward and fight for having a more functional democracy because
this is very important, very fundamental.

**Janusz Bugajski: Security starts at home. Let me ask you. As you said, I fully agree**
with you, things can change very rapidly, deteriorate very rapidly. Does that apply to
the neighbourhood here? Do you see still any danger in the Balkans region among your
neighbours? In other words, can some domestic dispute lead to international crises?

**Minister Kodheli: No, I don’t see it. On the contrary! Not by chance, NATO and EU**
ask for pre-assessment before becoming NATO and EU candidates. They have fixed
some requirements and one of them is Balkans integration and good neighbourly
relations among Balkans countries. This is very important. We have to learn the
lesson. I think Balkans have already learned the lesson, because many of our countries
within the Balkans came out from a bloody war, and this happened less than 15 years
ago, a period which all of us remember very well. In order to look forward, we have
to do it together, because we are going to walk the same path, and if we are doing
altogether, it is much easier for all of us, to reach our goals. So no, I think the Balkans
is a safe region.

**Janusz Bugajski: In terms of the Balkans environment, what is your view on this B-6**
proposal by Montenegro? In other words, what are the possibilities and limits of regional
cooperation? I know some of the neighbouring countries have said “We do not want to
create a new Yugoslavia.” “We want to be part of Europe, part of NATO. What is your
view of this? If it materializes, can it embrace for example sharing of some security
assets can it involve some of the common defence questions in the region?

**Minister Kodheli: I don’t think that a new Yugoslavia is going to be created. Not at**
all. We would like to be under the same umbrella, the EU umbrella, and maybe of
course for sure if we are talking about Balkans, the NATO umbrella as well. This

18

_Mimi Kodheli, Minister of Defence_

means that these organizations would be a big help for us and we have also to fulfil
some obligations. In order to meet these obligations, certainly we can have regional
agreements, string regional relationships, naturally we have to and we can do it. But
this is always going to be according to my opinion under those two big umbrellas
which are really big enough to embrace us and to take us in one direction and this
direction is democracy and free market. So these are the two main topics, democracy
and free market. Local or not, Balkan or not, regional or not, we have intense relations
among us and we are going to have them in the future. It is normal to have such
relations which are economic, but not only,

**Janusz Bugajski: But not in new international structures.**

**Minister Kodheli: Not in new international structures. Not at all.**

**Janusz Bugajski:** One thing I forgot to ask you before when we talked about
enlargement. I presume Albania supports Kosovo’s membership in NATO as soon as
the country qualifies.

**Minister Kodheli: Yes. We are going to support them. It’s normal to be like this.**
They have done tremendous steps forward in this direction. I am really happy for
them. They are working hardly to meet the requirements and I really hope that they
become members as soon as they can.

**Janusz Bugajski: How long do you think may this process take?**

**Minister Kodheli:** A little bit, but it is okay. I think that they are doing the right
things and this is much more important than how long will take. We are there. But we
are not the only ones to support them, in their way. Not at all! There are many other
countries in the region and not only. Certainly our main strategic partner which is US
is doing its best to support Kosovo as they have done in Albania’s case for sure.

**Janusz Bugajski: I presume that you would support Serbia’s membership in NATO.**

**Minister Kodheli: Yes of course. It has to be like this. Although Serbia is a partner**
of NATO, it does not take part in NATO led missions, but I am sure that for their part
they will do their best, to walk toward the NATO membership which for them is very
important issue and of course NATO membership process as well. I think these issues
are for Serbia as important as they are for all the Balkans countries.

**Janusz Bugajski: I have another question regarding the neighbours. We will conclude**
in a couple of minutes. One of the neighbours a question is about the role of Turkey.
Albania has a strategic partnership with Turkey. Visit of the Foreign Minister of
Turkey here in Tirana. What is your view in relation to the Albanian-Turkish
relationships? How important is how strategic?

**Minister Kodheli: They are both, important and strategic. Yes, first of all, because**
Turkey is a NATO member. Secondly, we do have a long history in common. We
have millions of Albanians living in Turkey. Yes, Turkey is going to be a strategic
partner, not only military speaking, politically speaking but also economically
speaking as well. They have been a big support for us in the Ministry of Defence and
Albanian Armed Forces is supported by Turks with trainings, with health assistance,

19

_National Security Policy for the Review of the Strategic Defence_

with equipment and this is going to continue because we have a very good relationship
with them.

**Janusz Bugajski: Let’s go a little bit further the field. With this new energy plan,**
the TAP natural gas pipeline, crossing from Azerbaijan through Anatolia through
Greece and to Albania to Europe Does it bring you closer to Caucasus countries
particularly to Azerbaijan. Do you see that relationship developing in a positive way?

**Minister Kodheli:** I see it in a positive way because if something is worth
economically speaking, it’s always positive. So yes, people can be linked even by a
pipe, not only because they have common cultural things, or they don’t have to be
only neighbours. This is the new technology and this is the new area that we are
living which is good. I think for the Albanian economy this will be one of the most
important happenings. So we will be all glad to begin with this pipe network and in
this case Well I don’t know who I have to thank you maybe God that our regions is so
rich with gas and all other resources which can help us have e good economic
performance and not only. So it is good to have this new friendship if I may call it
like this, with the Caucus countries. The more markets you deal with the better is.

**Janusz Bugajski: There is more diversity.**

**Minister Kodheli:** There is more diversity, your economic portfolio has, and the
better is. So, this is good for Albania as it is for the other countries where the pipe
has to pass through.

**Janusz Bugajski: And it is good for Azerbaijan. It is good for strategic reasons.**

**Minister Kodheli: Yes of course! Lucky them to have such kinds of resources with**
gas and not only. And lucky us to have such a nice geographic position like Albania.
And lucky others to have such other nice resources! That’s why the diversity makes
the world nicer and more beautiful. This must help all of us not in becoming enemies
but in becoming in why not friends.

**Janusz Bugajski: The very last question Minister Kodheli. How much intensive is**
the defence cooperation between Albania and United States? Do you see areas which
can be enhanced, improved, or developed further, what are the plans of the socialist
administration?

**Minister Kodheli: I am pretty sure that Rama Government is going to support the**
idea of having the United States as the biggest and most important strategic partner.
USA has helped us a lot in building up strategic defence papers in trying to modernize
and restructure the army, in training people, military as well as civilians, in supporting
us in Afghanistan missions, in supporting us with equipments of all kinds, in
supporting us in the demilitarization process, a support provided through the American
Embassy in Tirana. I would like to thank particularly Ambassador Arvizu on that and
the Office which is supporting the Ministry of Defence and me in particular “Cubic
Team.”

We signed a couple of weeks ago a very important agreement with the New Jersey
Academic School Our people are going to have very important training over there
and be prepared as leaders when they come back, be prepared as good military I

really would like to appreciate all that is done through the American taxpayers money
and I would like to assure the Albanian taxpayers that their money is going to be
spent in the right way, in an efficient way, not in a abusive way, and in this case
transparency is going to be improved. They will have the chance to know much
better what the Ministry of Defence is doing, why the Albanian army exists, and why
is spending 1.3% of GDP, their money in such a field. Being transparent means lot of
things for democracy and this what we are going to do.

**Janusz Bugajski:** Ok, Minister Kodheli. Thank you very much for your insights.
Thank you for joining me in the studio. I am sure we will have you back at some
point. Please have some rest you are going to have a very full portfolio.

**Minister Kodheli: I will try. Thank You.**

Major General Jeronim Bazo

Chief of General Staff of AAF

feel honoured and privileged to take the high position of the Chief of General

Staff of the Albanian Armed Forces. I accepted this task with humility, hope and
determination. By this appointment, I also take the responsibility to lead, plan

# Iand prepare the Armed Forces in carrying out their noble mission in the service of

the Fatherland and the Constitution, for order and good discipline in the Armed
Forces of my country through the best of our capacities and within the limits of
available resources. I strongly believe, but I also request the full support of the
government, MoD, and all members of the Armed Forces at a time when the wide
range of challenges we are facing are associated with training, equipping and
modernization of our forces according to NATO standards. The country entrusts his
sons and daughters to the Armed Forces, while we owe them guidance, training and
the best support possible.

Our common goal is to achieve the highest possible level of individual preparation and
practical skills by the entire Armed Forces. I am confident that our people, especially
those serving under the uniform of the Armed Forces, have the whole gifts and practical
and individual skills to cope with future challenges. Our capacity to participate in
operations of coalition level, and participation in the planning and development of
military duties or in support of peace, needs a deep analysis and examination, but also
for the preparation of integrated modernization plans. As Chief of the General Staff,
my main objective will be the inspiration of every member of the Armed Forces with a
clear purpose and a burning desire to do the utmost to reach a higher level.

As military, our primary task is to support the needs and requirements of our country
in regard to peace and security. Albanian taxpayers pay for the Armed Forces and my
intention is to spend this money in the most appropriate way. Thus, as the Chief of

-  Speech by Chief of the General Staff, delivered during the visit of Prime Minister of Albania, Mr. Edi
Rama, on the occasion of the presentation of the new Chief of General Staff of the Armed Forces.

the General Staff, I will take advantage of every opportunity to combine professional
training of forces with specific projects, in order to expiate and justify this confidence
taxpayers have in AF. We will do this with honesty, transparency and always in
compliance with the laws and regulations of our country.

Since 2009, Albania sits as a member with full rights at the Alliance’s table, while
since October this year, AF finalized the process of full integration into this entity.
These achievements are the result of several years of work from all members of the
Armed Forces and especially the military leadership over the years, and I take this
opportunity to thank them for their contribution and service.

NATO membership requires that we improve our capacities and capabilities to
effectively participate in coalition operations. As partners, we must not do less than
that. Armed forces have a significant amount of surplus materials, which are not
used any more. This is an unbearable burden for our human resources and
infrastructure. We will work together to eliminate the excessive materials in a
transparent and legal way. We will also need to modernize our forces; however this
will be achieved as part of a long-term coherent plan, which takes into account the
costs of lifecycle management, requirements for training, maintenance and repair
capabilities, and many other management related factors. Our planning will be
comprehensive, coordinated and with priorities that will focus on enhancing the
capabilities of the Armed Forces. We will also re-evaluate the way all members of
the Armed Forces are treated from the moment they enter the Armed Forces until
they retire in an honoured way. Political decision, made by Parliament some years
ago, to abolish compulsory military service, radically changed the management
requirements of the Armed Forces. We will continue to manage human resources in
a coherent and permanent way, preparing policies and methods that improve the
skills of each member of the Armed Forces.

We will permanently be a vital organization that constantly improves. We will prepare
detailed plans for a comprehensive preparation and training of the military, which
intend to improve both the quality and real training during all time. I remain confident
that with the support of our government and by continuing to work efficiently, our
armed forces will reinforce and maintain a high reputation of professionalism in the
eyes of our people and the Alliance. In this regard I would like to paraphrase the
outstanding leader Churchill who stressed: “Success is not final, failure is not fatal,
it is the human courage that makes the difference.”

I appreciate your confidence in my appointment as Chief of the General Staff of the
Armed Forces. I’ll take on this responsibility very seriously and I swear in front of
you and all members of the Armed Forces that I will put all my strength to meet the
requirements of this important post with integrity. Finally, I would say that I belong
to that kind of military who strongly believes in the maxim that is taught to young
cadets from the fall to serve in the Armed Forces. More or less it’s like this:
“Leadership is built upon trust and trust is built upon honour!”

##### SECTION ONE

**SECURITY ANALYSIS AND ASSESMENTS**

This is a permanent section of the Military Review, addressing a wide range of
topics on security and defence.

Military leadership is approached from the globalization perspective. So far, the
research is mainly characterized by focusing on tactical and technical level, while
strategic insights are scarce. No frequently, a research is focused on military
leadership to date. This fact makes us understand how little was the attention
given to the most important military topic, such as leadership. Based on his long
experience in various management positions in the Armed Forces, Brigadier
General, PhD. Sandër Lleshi gives some insights on military leadership trying
to give an answer to the question, what is the specific share of the human role in
the success of a military structure. Basically this is the central question that his
paper seeks to approach.

In today’s democratic society, one of the inherent features of a leader and the
constructive leadership is the responsibility, understood as responsibility towards
the followers for honest leadership, in order to protect their interests and the
fulfilment of the major goals of the community and society.

_The mix and method regarding how hard and soft security policies are_
_implemented in times of crisis and conflict, are still contentious issues. There is_
_a substantive amount of discussion among scholars and experts on how to make_
_the best use of these policies. The common denominator in such discussions_
_seems to be that the elements of soft security are of a rather preventive nature_
_and best employed to reinstitute stability and introduce normalcy in afflicted_
_areas-emphasises Brigadier General Bardhyl Hoxha in his paper._

According to the researcher’s opinion of PhD. Jaup Zenuni, it seems as if public
diplomacy is not connected with the Armed Forces. Such an approach is not
_only outdated but also counterproductive because in the context of the battle “to_
_win hearts and minds”, which constitutes one of the pillars of “soft power”, the_
_AF today conduct an asymmetric war which requires the contribution of public_
_diplomacy in their activity._

_Language is not only a major defining characteristic of the political identity of_
_individuals, groups or states, but also the most natural element of political_
_behaviour. The use and spread of languages constitutes a reliable indicator of_
_geopolitical processes._

In this section, do not remain out of the focus, researchers coming from the
regional countries, such as Colonel PhD. Metohija Dojcinovski, from Macedonia,
participant at the Senior Course on Security and Defence Studies.

Prime Minister’s Security Advisor

**Short commentary.** _The idea for a thorough research on military leadership has_
_motivated the author of this paper for a long time. The abundance of world literature_
_and the almost complete absence of Albanian literature on this field represent an_
_abnormality that deserves attention._

_There is almost no Albanian systematized research in the field of military leadership._
_Even the efforts made in the recent decades to encourage the reliable research in_
_this field have not changed the situation. The recent scientific work has been focused_
_on other topics, leaving the military leadership out of the focus of the scholars._

_Out of 110 doctoral dissertations, conducted at the Defence Academy since the_
_beginning of 1982 until 2010, or 18-20% of them belong to military history, 18-20 %_
_have focused on operations and 15-17 % cover issues of tactical character. Other_
_dissertations, smaller in number, cover other narrow fields, mainly those related to_
_arms and services of the Armed Forces._

_Military leadership in the age of globalization_

The research is mainly characterized by focusing on tactical and technical level,
while strategic insights are scarce. No dissertation is focused on military leadership
to date. Suffice this fact to understand how little was the attention given to perhaps
the most important military topic, i.e. leadership.

The lack of scientific approaches in the field of military leadership and the drastic
global changes that are typical for nowadays development, often impairing many
theories and doctrines of the field, were the impetus that encouraged this paper.

My long experience in various management positions in the Armed Forces has often
led to the question, what is the specific share of the human role in the success of a
military structure. Basically this is _the central question that this paper seeks to_
approach.

Oscillation between extremes in all areas has been accompanied by major and deep
flaws in many aspects. Deep flaws, similar to those that suffered by metals during
they are tempered and immediately go from very high temperatures to very low ones
and vice versa. NATO integration and progressive alignment with the EU is a new
phase. Extinction of oscillations during this course, approach with the centre of
geographic, political, economic, military, cultural and spiritual gravity seems to be
the new trend of development of the country and our military. Globalization seems
to be the indispensable lubricant that will facilitate this progress.

**The military leadership in the context of globalization**

_“Every era has its defining terms. Nowadays, one of these terms is “globalization”,_
_which contains the widespread belief that we live in a world without borders. Sovereign_
_states seem unable to control international flows of goods and services (less people)_
_and in many countries the state itself is falling apart.”[ 1]_

Apart from enthusiastic or fatalistic comments globalization, does not represent a
new and unknown phenomenon worldwide. The new phenomenon is the “human
perception” about the speed of change the nowadays world is facing. The future
again will continue to bring other surprises, due to the human inability to predict.
Change will follow its exponential course of growth, while humankind will follow
its linear trend in forecasting the future, finding themselves among inevitable and
unpredictable suddenness.

As a trend, globalization progressively increases the role of individuals, multiplying
their knowledge and strengths, while it weakens and alters many of the characteristics
of other traditional actors, including the state. The growth and expansion of freedom
space and economic and cultural prosperity, constant combination of economic and
political interests parallelly reduces the possibilities of interstate conflicts as well.

Globalization affects war and conflicts with the same force as it affects other social,
economic, political or cultural phenomena. The general conclusion is that globalization
is not only reducing the number of military conflicts, but also is profoundly changing
the way they evolve. Even in the field of military conflicts we can clearly notice the

1 Ethan B. Kapstein, Governing the Global Economy: International Finance and the State
(Cambridge,MA: Harvard University Press, 1994), p. 1.

26

_Brigadier General PhD. Sandër Lleshi_

propensity of their decreasing in size and diminishing of the role large structures and
heavy systems. At the same time we observe the tendency of a growing role of
individuals and small structures. The space created by the “withdrawal” of large
structures and heavy systems is occupied by network in its broadest sense. The network
is constantly becoming a global platform, which provides information, multiplies
the power, optimizes cost etc. Network is somehow replacing what is disappearing.

Globalization compels states to consider conflict as a new problem rather than a
solution to the problems that arise in interstate relations. Overlapping of the other
actors with global role like international concerns, international or supranational
organizations, which often pursue other goals than those followed by states, makes
global actors to often play inhibitory role for potential conflicts generated for
traditional state reasons.

Even in those extreme cases when traditional military conflict and war cannot be
avoided, anyhow, what is avoided is the way of their evolution. There is a general
assumption that wars and military conflicts today tend to be limited in many aspects.
They are limited in space, in time, forces and equipment. The general tendency is to
operate with fewer forces and means, the attempt to reach in a short time limit the
strategic objectives, maximum reduction of side effects etc. The only element that
tends to increase is the speed of operation, which relies on the ever-growing
information and ever improving technology.

Increased speed based on more and more information and technology is the response
toward development. “A new information revolution is occurring .... It will radically
_change the meaning of information both for enterprises and individuals. This is not_
_a revolution of technology, machinery, techniques or speed. It is a revolution of_
_CONCEPTS.”[2]_

It seems that in the battlefield speed will be the criterion that will make the difference
between those who win and those who lose. No big fish, but fast fish seems to have
more chances to win. This shift in importance from the weight and measure to speed
seems to open an extraordinary perspective to those who still do not own a problematic
measure. At the same time, it presents a serious challenge to those who own so much
measure and weight that it becomes a problem.

As a trend, globalization presents a tremendous opportunity for those countries and
the armies, which aim to link their success not with the measure, but with energy, a
thing that is always a function of speed, the speed to develop, to adapt, to make
decisions and to operate.

In the field of international relations the conclusion is that globalization, in its present
form has challenged many of the fundamental pillars of the system. Some of the
most important taboos of the system as territory, sovereignty, borders, language, and
population have been disturbed a lot in their traditional “sanctity”.

Globalization has affected influenced, created precedents and has necessitated the

_Military leadership in the age of globalization_

important rethinking and development in regards to international system as a whole
and the role of national states and their sovereignty in particular. Even though we
still cannot define the future of the international system regarding its past we can
assume that it has lost its sanctity acquired 1648.

Despite the anti-state enthusiasm vibrant in the era of globalization, the need for it

[state] remains to indisputable. What should be discussed is the need for a new profile
of the modern state. The new profile of the state requires a fundamental revision, a
review that must affect its entire classical image. The present and the future do not
call for less state, but the need for a different state. State as the exclusive manufacturer
of the public good will continue to be charged with the burden of meeting the public
need. Meanwhile the public domain expands, the need for the public good increases,
its insurance becomes increasingly more complex and difficult. The public good
cannot be provided by relying on old instruments and procedures. In this sense, the
traditional state faces challenge of radical change.

One of the key notions that require a deep rethinking is the national territory, its
meaning and significance. The meaning for national territory needs to be “digitized”.
This means that the concept should be expanded to include a lot more than just
ground or water surface of the country. It should include the virtual space of the
digital world. As part of the “national territory” should be considered even those
areas which, although geographically do not belong to it, but in functional terms
contribute to national interests.

_“Only the Third World countries think that the territory is still important. We, the_
_others, have understood that life exists exclusively on the World Wide Web and on_
_CNN. States must submit their “fetishes of the land” and find a new role.”[ 3]_

It is likely that globalism may influence even the concept of **state borders. The**
classical meaning of national borders risks to transform into a useless historical relic,
and sometimes harmful, if its adaptation to the radically changed conditions is not
achieved.

Kenichi Ohmae states in his book The Borderless World: Power and Strategy in the
_Interlinked Economy that the political map, borders among states is clear as they_
_have always have been. But in the competition map, which shows the flow of financial_
_and industrial activity, the borders have considerably vanished._

Even the national territory and its borders should be conceived as another wider and
more complicated category than simply the geographic area of the physical territory
or the length of the border line. _Thurow_ concludes that _sentimental ties with any_
_particular geographical part are not part of the new system.[4]_

Globalization has imposed fundamental changes in the way it should be conceptualized
and protects national interest in its complete spectrum. Expansion of the notion on
borders, territory and role of the state, brings as a result a new meaning to national

interest itself. National interest in the era of globalization has become much more
complex and interdependent to extra national factors. In a way, the range of national
interests is considerably narrowed; while a significant part of the national interests
are “internationalized”. This means that interests of individuals, groups and people
of different nations and countries are becoming increasingly globally interdependent
to the extent that traditional meaning of national interest itself has radically changed.

The changes that have occurred and the tendency of those expected to change, calls
for a “revision of territory and borders”. With the review, we should understand a
review of the meaning of these categories. Certainly that should not imply devaluation,
but their re-evaluation.

It seems that the reduction of the role and the extensive re-conceptualization of the
meaning of borders are accompanied by the parallel trend of increasing the role of
diversified services networks, which facilitate communication and exchange of
information, knowledge, goods and various services.

New and very important entities are simultaneously emerging on the world stage as
multinational concerns and other stakeholders, along with national states and other
bodies associated with them. It seems that the trend is a shift of balances from states
to other actors, mainly to global players.

International scene has undergone significant changes as well. The birth of new states
is an effect of globalization. It represents a product of the freedom of peoples to
choose new ways of managing their fates and interests. Along with the increase of
the number of independent states, it has happened also the increase of the number of
partly free and free countries and the decrease of the number of countries without
freedom. This is regarded as another major effect that globalization has brought on a
global level. It can be generally concluded that globalization and freedom constitute
a symbiosis; they are two phenomena mutually supporting each other.

The change that has occurred in the whole world, the economy, society, culture,
system of international relations has changed the same as the concept of security
defence, fighting for peace etc. The dynamics of change has affected many things
while it is true that it cannot affect some of the basic principles. Unlike the Cold War,
the globalization system has one overarching feature-and that is integration. The
symbol of this system is a single word-Web, World Wide Web.[5]

“The Cold War was a drama of states confronting states, balancing states, and aligning
_with states. And, as a system, the cold war was balanced at the centre by two super_
_states, two superpowers: the United States and the Soviet Union. The globalization_
_system, by contrast, is built around three balances, which overlap and affect one_
_another. The first is the traditional balance of power between nation-states…. The_
_second important power balance in the globalization system is between nation-states_
_and global markets…. The third balance that you have to pay attention to…. is the_
_balance between individuals and nation-states…. globalization can be an incredible_
_force-multiplier for individuals. Individuals can increasingly act on the world stage_

_Supermarkets, but also what I call “super-empowered individuals”. Some of these_
_super-empowered individuals are quite angry, some of them quite wonderful-but all_
_of them are now able to act much more directly and much more powerfully on the_
_world stage.”[ 6]_

Globalization is a phenomenon that acts against the centralizing tendencies. Through
the expansion of the scale of freedom and democracy, globalization inspires and
nourishes the spirit of individualism and personal independence. In the same measure,
globalization also increases the level of individual knowledge, level of professional
competence by involving even the hierarchical structures, by increasing at the same
time the ambition of the people for decision-making.

_The first generation of modern war was dominated by massed manpower and_
_culminated in the Napoleonic Wars. The second generation, which was quickly_
_adopted by the world’s major powers, was dominated by firepower and ended in_
_World War I. In relatively short order, during World War II the Germans introduced_
_third-generation warfare, characterized by manoeuvre. That type of combat is still_
_largely the focus of U.S. forces. Fourth-generation wars, or 4GW, have now evolved,_
_taking advantage of the political, social, economic and technical changes since World_
_War II. In short, 4GW has evolved along with society to make use of the opportunities_
_it provides.[ 7]_

Technical and technological progress increases significantly the opportunities of
superior to control and intervene in domains of subordinate units, bringing in this
way another captivating effect for more centralization. Simultaneously, this progress
greatly increases the volume of information (in real facts and data) available to
superiors. Unfortunately, the tide of data only enhances the illusion of superiors for
more information. In fact, this tide of data and facts presents a serious pitfall rather
than a chance for supervisors who believe that people can already do everything, or
anything.

_The effect of the information-age technology has been not only to increase the tempo_
_of the operations but also to provide images of operations that begin to condition the_
_strategic plans and define time limits of operations.[8]_

During the period of big changes after the fall of the Iron Curtain, different states
have realized differently transformation to the new era. A complex series of factors
have influenced states to deviate from their natural role, bringing often quite severe
consequences for their societies and often also for all humankind. Sometimes the
problem has been the excesses of the state, or the state’s attempt to play the role of
others; by getting out of area of responsibility. Thus, for example, the communist
state’s efforts to take over almost all resulted in a real disaster. Equally problematic

is the lack of state. Excessive contraction of state and forming a vacuum in the area
of its natural responsibility also led to catastrophic consequences. Albania’s experience
has shown the consequences of each of the phenomena in question. Even Albania
the same way as other countries, has experienced dramatically and with serious
consequences the “excess” the same as the “contraction” of the state.

When an alysing Albanian in the above cited book, Friedman writes: “Albania of the
_1990’s is the poorest country I have ever encountered and among the Cleptocracies_
_of the free trade. Albania was one of the most isolated countries for over fifty years,_
_having adopted a Maoist pro Chinese attitude during the Cold War. After he fall of_
_the Berlin Wall, the communist regime in Albania fell down in 1991. Lastly, Albanian_
_thought that they could have everything the other already had: hardware of the free_
_trade. Unfortunately, this was all they got. Albania became full of hardware, but_
_with no software and with no operation system.[9] The above example is used as an_
_illustration to present to the world a typical case of globalism area.”[10]_

“Implementation of leadership through mission requires a somewhat authentic
recreation of the army. Recreation may seem a difficult, tedious, costly, tedious and
perhaps unnecessary undertaking, and so on. But recreation is the only option.
Albanian Armed Forces cannot continue to strain towards true modernization, as the
modern army of Albania’s new century, by attempting in vain to repair an edifice
based on old and uncertain foundations. The modern army of the new Albania should
be based on a new philosophy, not the Marxist one, in a new strategy, not the isolation,
in a new doctrine, not the bunkerization; in a new education, not in indoctrination, in
a new spirit, not the distrust, in a new organization, not the centralization, in a new
mission of freedom, not that of slavery”.

_The role of “Soft Security” in the traditional security framework_


##### The role of “Soft Security” in the traditional security framework

Brigadier General MSc. Bardhyl Hoxha

TRADOCC Commander

**Short commentary. International environment of the early twenty-first century is**
_characterized by uncertainty, instability, rapid changes of situations, less employment_
_of old rules and their substitution with new ones, which require enhancement of the_
_decision-makers’ assessment skills in order to timely and effectively respond to such_
_situations. Analysts argue that today’s world is more chaotic and future developments_
_are more unpredictable than in any other period of history_

_Security can be defined in general terms as security or freedom from fear and danger._
_Studies have focused traditionally mainly on the security threats, use and control of_
_military forces. However, since the end of the Cold War, the concept of security has_
_expanded, including state security, societal and human security[1]._

_The mix and method regarding how hard and soft security policies are implemented_
_in times of crisis and conflict are still contentious issues. There is a substantive_
_amount of discussion among scholars and experts on how to make the best use of_
_these policies. The common denominator in such discussions seems to be that the_
_elements of soft security are of a rather preventive nature and best employed to_
_reinstitute stability and introduce normalcy in afflicted areas._

_It is argued today that through enhancing cooperation and dialogue, as well as_
_extending financial assistance and development programs, the aim now is to neutralize_
_the potential violent nature of soft threats and prevent them from becoming “hard_
_threats” in the long run._

1 **_State Security is related primarily to the traditional security of the country: the defence of sovereignty,_**

_on planning and suggests as well the possible strategies of regulation and mitigation._
_The ultimate goal is to create a sustainable system in the region/state, so that external_
_assistance is not required and all forms of “soft” and “hard” threats become_
_irrelevant._

**_Soft Security: A conceptual framework_**
**_Soft Security vs. Hard Security_**

Security is defined in terms of perceived threats and risks. Particularly in today’s
complex environment, it is surely a multifaceted and evasive issue.

In essence, security deals with preventing or containing threats. There are two
categories that can be used to define threats: (a) _Hard threats and (b) Soft threats._
Terrorism and weapons of mass destruction are generally accepted as hard threats,
whereas extreme poverty, disparity among and within societies, and the spread of
infectious diseases or climate change and environmental degradation fall under the
category of soft threats.[ 2] This list is by no means exhaustive. One can add, for example,
inter-ethnic conflicts, illegal migration and trafficking in human beings to the list of
soft threats. Cyber threats, which can inflict enormous damage to the economic and
social infrastructure of countries, are also considered as soft threats.

In reality, there are no clear-cut dividing lines between hard and soft threats. They
are inter-linked and require a comprehensive and inter-disciplinary approach.[3 ]In fact,
a soft threat can easily turn into a hard one. Making profit from illegal migration in
order to finance their illicit activities is a good example of how terrorist organizations
transform a soft threat into a hard one.
**Role of** _“Soft Security” in the traditional security framework_

A substantial difference between hard and soft security policies is that states
traditionally resort to conventional methods such as deploying military forces to
provide hard security. In soft security policies, however, the use of conventional
military force is neither automatic nor preferable. However, the availability and use
of soft security policy options is a function of the situation. For instance, if there is
room for interacting with the local/central authority, non-military means, including
social and financial assistance can be utilized with a view to prevent a spiral of
instability. Such methods vary depending on the political and social fabric of the
region/state, as well as its level of economic and financial development.

In _hard security issues, although there is an increased role for civilians,[4] they are_
mostly complementary, whereas in soft security missions, civilians pioneer the effort.

_The role of “Soft Security” in the traditional security framework_

implementing soft security policies are indispensable. The value of civilian expertise,
particularly in the fields of public information and other non-military activities in
general is of indispensable nature. It is the civilians that maintain daily contact with
the local people and play a primary role in the implementation of soft security policies.
As to inter-agency cooperation, civilian components of security policies are both
developed and implemented with the expertise of the relevant government institutions
and agencies. Therefore, apart from the need for well-trained personnel and
infrastructure, a constant and effective consultation mechanism must be in place.

The role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) is crucial, yet this role depends
crucially on their area of interest and capabilities. The end-goal is to create a
sustainable system in the targeted region/state, such that outside assistance is no
longer required and all forms of threats, soft and hard, have been rendered
insignificant. Some concrete examples of soft security missions are NATO’s operation
in Afghanistan and EU police operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia.
The KFOR (Kosovo Force) and SFOR (Stabilisation Force in Bosnia-Herzegovina)
operations, as well as the US-led Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan,
however, are hard security missions of a military nature.

Within this framework, international organizations have reviewed their structures and
procedures vis-à-vis conflicts. The United Nations, having the primary responsibility
for the maintenance of international peace and security as enshrined in its Charter, has
begun to focus mostly on conflict prevention strategies. As elements of soft security
policies, building national capacities and supporting the role of civil societies with the
help of specialized UN Agencies, have been the priority areas of action for the UN.
The guiding principle therein has been its commitment to the principles of the political
independence, sovereign equality and territorial integrity of all States.[ 5]

The UN was also active in multidimensional peacekeeping operations, in which the
responsibilities of civilians increased significantly. Among these responsibilities are
the following:

-  Enabling former adversaries to implement complex peace agreements by
liaising with a range of political and civil actors,

-  Coordinating the delivery of humanitarian assistance,

-  Assisting with the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of former
combatants,

-  Supervising and conducting elections,

-  Strengthening the rule of law, including assistance with judicial reform and
training of civilian police,

-  Promoting respect for human rights and investigating alleged violations,

-  Assisting with post-conflict recovery and rehabilitation, and

-  Setting up a transnational administration of a territory as it moves towards
independence.

-  These tasks also serve as guiding principles for other international organizations
conducting soft security missions as well as their civilian components.

NATO, on the other hand, which was conventionally characterized as a static,12
hard security and defence organization, has undertaken an ambitious transformation
agenda. It has also included soft security policies in its portfolio. NATO’s role in
Afghanistan is a case in point. The Alliance took over the International Security
Assistance Force (ISAF) on 11 August 2003. This is NATO’s first mission beyond
the Euro-Atlantic area. With the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1510,
ISAF’s mandate was extended beyond Kabul. NATO is in Afghanistan in order to
help bring peace and stability throughout the country. To this end, NATO developed
the “Provincial Reconstruction Teams” (PRT) concept, a practical tool of interaction
between the Allied countries and the Afghan people in theatre.

The European Union, for its part, also has a comprehensive and inclusive soft security
policy, based on the understanding that no region is immune to the effects of conflicts.[6]
The EU Security Strategy Document 14 is illuminating in this respect. The EU soft
security policies are based on the assumption that “conflicts destroy social and normal
infrastructure; encourage criminality; deter investments and make normal economic
life impossible.” The EU also finds that key threats are both hard and soft in nature:
Terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, regional conflicts, failing
states and organized crime.

The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) is the largest
regional security organization in the Eurasian-Atlantic space, with 55 participating
States, covering an area from Vancouver to Vladivostok. The concept of “cooperative
security,” which is based upon the understanding that common security in the context
of globalization can only be achieved through increased cooperation between
participating states, is yet another notion developed within the fold of the OSCE
long ago.
**Culture as a “Soft Security” component**

One of the sayings about culture, among many related to it, is that culture is related
to “the ways in which human beings overcome their original barbarism... to become
fully humane”.[7] Imagine what happened in the Cold War. Each military bloc, namely
due to a residue of barbarism in the 20th century, spent hundreds of billions of dollars
to be ready to extinguish each other. This was the perception of risk and threat.

Surprisingly, in 1990s, the Cold War ended without any military battle taking place.
In fact, the battle took place, but it did not occur in regions of defence, or with an
offensive deployment. It was held in another field: in the economic race, competition

of development, the race of opposing perceptions. Understanding this second way is
the competition of minds compared to the competition of guns, competition to look
ahead toward culture instead of being left behind in the mindsets of barbarism.

All of this victory, the biggest victory in the history of the world, was as such, not
only because it faded away the tension of thousands of nuclear warheads, but it
moved away firstly the tension of militarized minds that held anxious humankind
for nearly five decades.

Twenty years after the end of the Cold War, still tell us more about this rainbow leap
between war to destroy every culture and the culture of avoiding every war. Imagine
the Balkans, whose culture has been historically only of conflicts, today, after twenty
years, we have diametrically another Balkans. Its peoples are also other people.
“Rooted for centuries in this region of Europe, the existence of any of them cannot
be conditioned by the other. In the case of complexities, willingly or unwillingly, we
are forced to agree. Does it seem a bleak vision? I think what we experienced a few
years ago there was not less scary. To return to a more hopeful vision, it must be said
that a balance has been established historically in the Balkans however. Today, the
European Union in terms of a tutor accepted by everyone, this balance multiply
secured.”[8]

In international relations, culture has a different vision, a vision which assigns priority
to cooperation and communication channels and not the iron curtain that had taken
place between nations and people. In such cases, considered as crucial, such as defence
and security, instead of the culture of keeping the opponent targeted, it was established
culture of friendly meetings, joint consultations of finding ways to overcome security
challenges together. In this sense, culture is transformed into force, representing a
core dimension of power that shapes the concept of the supremacy of what is meant
by the concept of “security”.

Culture is another way of solving out differences. The differences are always natural,
not only between people, but more especially between countries in a region like the
Balkans, where the differences were so profound, that very Europeans have lost
patience, and why not, even confidence in the Balkans. There is an objective reason
why these differences exist: Balkans has been the biggest point of clash between
civilizations, religions, cultures and civilizations, among the most powerful clashes
of humanity. Due to these cultures, issues of post-Cold War Balkan began to be
solved by methods that were used nearly a century ago, with those of the Balkan
wars. But, finally, the culture of modern civilization and the values of the smoothing
over differences gained advantage over the severing the differences used in the
nationalist garb.
**Education as a “Soft Security” component**

To relate the term “education” with the term “security” seems somewhat strange,
extraneous and irrelevant. But we should not forget that the concept of “education”

has to do not only simply with the formal schooling cycle or completion of a course
or certification of student with a diploma, or getting some technical knowledge and
skills to practice a profession. Education is an life-long background investment.
Education cultivates more technical skills, illuminates the mind, opens horizons of
thought and critical judgement, increases the logic of reason, cultivates personality
values, love and friendship, and cultivates recognition of people, cultures, their
languages and civilizations. Thus, the educated person breaks the vicious circle of
hatred, according to which “I don’t love you because I don’t know you, and not
_knowing you, I do not love you” to be replaced with a modern vision under whose_
fellowship “I know you and therefore I love you, by knowing, I will love you even
_more.”_

Education in itself, with its goals, constitutes an investment in security in the sense
that it prepares people with broad thought capabilities, multiple choice solutions,
and great richness of feelings. These values are those that precisely, do not promote
confrontation, but peace and freedom. On the other hand, these values are a ready
instrument of the mind in the psyche of cultivated people that, in case of danger, to
weigh alternatives and not to fall prey to the instruments of force, myopia and fatalistic
solutions. It is no accident that the most powerful international initiatives to support
peace were undertaken firstly, by nations that have good indicators of higher education.

The modern world, especially after the end of the Cold War, has created numerous
opportunities and has implemented practices intense exchange of educating young
people and women in different countries. Such a reality is perhaps unique to the
Albanian youngsters, a large percentage of them, is not just those immigrants but
schooled in Europe or in U.S. This is a real revolution, because it creates powerful
exchanges currents, networks and friendships which are based on the security of
each country. All these young people are the best ambassadors, soldiers who better
to convey safety, namely through the soft power of education.

**Transformation of culture and education-the most important investment in “Soft**
**_Security”_**

Before the 90s, Albania, although spent ten times more funds compared to today,
although there were more soldiers and weaponry, again there was a war situation in
the region and Albanians lived thinking of only one choice: war. Albania is now a
NATO member. Not only Albania, but each country after the accession, normally
needs about a decade to become fully integrated. Why? Precisely because the formal
act of acceptance is not at the same time the act that shows how much integrated is a
country in terms of standards and especially the culture of the cooperation in planning
and operations.

Since September 1996, until February 2013, Albania has committed about 6.000
military troops to military operations led by NATO, EU and UN. Albania is also
included, and even has a broad activity in regional security initiatives such as “Adriatic
_3”, which has become “Adriatic 5”. Under this initiative, the Albanian side has started_
“The Senior Security and Defence Course” in Tirana, to strengthen cooperation
between countries of the region through joint education and training of staff senior
civil and military from the region, on issues of security and defence policies. The

course shall provide the opportunity for participants to promote in their places of
work. Referring curricula in this course are those of “George C. Marshall European
_Centre for Security Studies”, “NATO College” in Rome, “The Baltic Defence College”,_
“USA War College” etc, therefore, an elite training culture.

Similarly, as part of the initiative Southeastern European Defence _Ministerial (SEDM)_
which was established in Tirana since 1996, actually express cultural trends
cooperation and regional integration, including the _Multinational Peace Force of_
_South Eastern Europe (MPFSEE) or the South-Eastern Europe Brigade (SEEBRIG)_
and a number of other projects. SEDM joins region countries in a variety of activities
embodied in joint projects and commitments in the field of arms control, border
security, fight against terrorism, militarization, military technology sharing, joint
exercises, operations for the prevention of natural disasters, to undertake peacekeeping
missions outside the region, bringing a spirit of loyalty and mutual respect. Member
states see each other in the light of friendship and partnership, away of the lack of
confidence and opposing spirit. On the other hand, except for the purpose of
strengthening the ties of cooperation and interaction between the SEDM countries,
this process has played a major role in bringing non-member countries of the EuroAtlantic structures to these structures, thus making culture of cooperation a regional
culture.

Albania has established a bilateral cooperation in the field of defence and military
with all NATO member and partner countries. Collaboration consists of fields of
education, training and military qualifications. Albania has sent for 20 years to these
countries a relatively large number of military to obtain educational qualifications.
The successful collaboration is developed through joint exercises, joint commitments
in operations within NATO, exchange of experiences and expertise in different fields,
courtesy visits, etc. All these developments have had a significant resultant: Albania
has already developed a culture different from what we inherited from the past: the
culture of initiative and responsibility for culture of working together according to
NATO standards and education in conformity to these standards.

Certainly, as we mentioned above, we still cannot assess ourselves that we are fully
integrated. But let us remember that integration is a process, not a date. All members
of the Alliance have passed through this process, in different time lines. It is important
for us to have this culture: a culture that processes never end. Even the oldest members
of NATO today require new conceptions such as that of “Smart Defence”. Therefore
still there is much to be done to develop further on this culture.

Culture and education come into play in that part of the arsenal of security of a
country that not only guarantee security, but the philosophy of security. Transition in
different historical stages of human development and at different stages of changing
international relations, starting from World War II, the Cold War and finally the
Fourth Generation War, have revealed the changes in perception of threats and risks
as well as elements that affect participants in this process .

Cultural differences, as mentioned above, reflect in a tangible way the deviation from
a reflection into another. The past and current conflict resolution and building of relations
(until the end of the Cold War) is replaced with regional and global multilateralism. It

38


-----

_Brigadier General MSc. Bardhyl Hoxha_

has remained just in the annals of history study. The current culture does not reflect
points of divisions but the meeting points in the direction of strengthening to a higher
degree of the security. So, in essence, we change the way of thinking and acting, or a
different culture of communication and coherence in cooperation.

The first starting point to reflect a different culture in the approach to security is
undoubtedly, education. It provides visibility in solving differences, not in the
traditional way, but in otherwise receiving display of behaviour and manner of
judgement, replacing conflict with different ways of thinking, characteristic of the
higher level of education.

Albania and the Armed Forces are continuing to pursue the fulfilling of the criteria
toward full NATO forces are supporting military operations in the framework of the
UN, NATO, EU and regional initiatives such as “Adriatic 5”. Besides these areas of
cooperation, our Armed Forces are involved in various education and training
programs, as member and candidate countries of these organizations.

In this way, interaction of culture and education becomes possible, transforming
them from individual into partners, from regional to global. Completion of the
initiatives of organizations where our country is part, such as “Smart Defence”, seek
by the participating countries, “surrender” a part of individual sovereignty and this
means that the current culture of cooperation has changed in content and the concept,
as a result of growth to a higher degree of culture and education by collaboration.

**Cooperation in “Smart Defence” framework**

In general terms, one can define security as security or freedom from fear and danger.
Traditionally, studies have focused mainly on the security threat, use and control of
military forces. However, since the end of the Cold War, the concept of security has
expanded to include some of the new challenges of the sovereignty of states and
corporate integrity. Today’s security threats involving organized crime, ethnic and
ideological conflicts, corruption, insecure borders, illegal immigration, climate
change, cyber attacks, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and of course
terrorism. A feature of the next decades will be the increase in the power of non-state
actors as a result of globalization, which can empower individual fanatics, giving
access to the tools and showed more devastating as the events of 11 September 2001.

Climate change will be accompanied by a wide range of unpleasant developments
which no nation-state has only the power to contain. These are the threats that will
shape the future security environment of the next decades. But the future security
environment will naturally face economic and financial crisis, as a result of which,
all the countries of the alliance will face budgetary constraints that cannot be
understood without financial constraints and in defence budgets. Naturally the
question arises how to develop alliances in order to bring its members a maximum
security and a maximum impact on the shaping of this new environment? This requires
new solutions, to provide more capacity at a lower cost. This is the reason from
which derived the concept of “Smart Defence”, which originates in the _European_
_Policy Centre in Brussels, on 30 September 2011._

_The role of “Soft Security” in the traditional security framework_

The NATO Secretary General, when explaining the concept of “Smart Defence”
notes: “I know that in the period of financial constraints one cannot spend more but
cannot spend even less. The answer is to spend better and spend money to achieve
the best. Let us help countries preserve their capacity and provide new capacities.
This means that we need to better define priorities, specialize in certain capacities
and seek multinational solutions. This is what I call “Smart Defence.”[ 9]

##### Are we facing the clash of civilizations?

Colonel Dilaver Hoxha

Deputy Commander of the Land Forces

**Short commentary. The question, are we facing clash of civilizations, cannot be**
_answered without going through the history. During most of human existence, civilizations_
_were irregular or nonexistent. With the beginning of the modern era, about A.D._
_1500, global politics assumed two dimensions: the nation states of the West (Europe_
_and the US), and others, which interacted, competed, and fought wars with each_
_other. At the same time, Western nations also expanded, conquered, colonized, and_
_decisively influenced every other civilization. During the Cold War global politics_
_became bipolar with a world was divided into three parts._

_In the post-Cold War world, the most important distinctions among people are not_
_ideological, political, or economic, but cultural. 20 years after the publication of_
_‘Clash of Civilizations’ by Samuel Huntington, all of the individual arguments about_
_the specifics are differently. He declared a new phase to world politics, which consists_
_to the fundamental source of conflict in this new world, will not be primarily_
_ideological, politic or primarily economic but cultural. This book has become a_
_classic work of international relations and one of the most influential books ever_
_written about foreign affairs._

_The current situation, accounts also the real divergences in economic growth,_
_democratization and religion. The present Islam v/s West narrative, the climb of a_
_monolithic China, isolation of Japan, rise of trade blocs, current economical crisis,_
_water and other natural resources shortages will follow with Clash of Civilization._
_As a conclusion, the essential reason that we are facing the Clash of civilization is_
_the differences in views between cultural groups._

**What is civilization?**

he word “civilization” comes from the Latin word civitas which literally means
city-state. It has been found for the first time in a French book (L’Ami des
_hommes,1756) by Victor de Riqueti. It has been defined as “An advanced state_

# Tof human society, in which a high level of culture, science, industry and government

has been reached”.

41

_Are we facing the clash of civilizations?_

The civilization has changed from primitive existence into a complex world. Each
new civilization established itself by building on the legacy of its predecessor and
raising itself to new stature. It has been started from Mesopotamia and Egypt,
continued in 5[th] century BC by classical Greece which brought its democracy, art,
philosophy and science. In additional Athens, later Rome, spread civilization
throughout the Mediterranean Sea, that changed the face of Europe forever. This
classical legacy built the foundations of the modern Western civilization, initially
fostered in Europe and later carried further by America.

There are too many definitions of civilizations such are: a type of culture and society
developed by a particular nation in a particular period; a human society that has
highly developed resources and a complex cultural, political, and legal organization
in social development; or a stage of human social development that is considered
most advanced.

As a result of those mention above the most appropriate meaning of civilianization is
written in the international dictionary: “An advanced state of intellectual, cultural,
and material development in human society, marked by progress in the arts and
sciences, the extensive use of record-keeping, including writing, and the appearance
of complex political and social institutions”.
**The main characteristics of civilizations**

To describe the characteristics of civilization, first we need to make a distinction
between directionality and progress. Directionality is change over time, the forward
movement of history, without judging the value of that change. Progress, on the
other hand, is directionality toward improvement, or movement in a desirable
direction. Another approach to value-free historical descriptions of civilianization is
to think through the process by which some human groups moved from agricultural
villages and towns into cities and states. By clarifying this process we can arrive at a
more nearly neutral think that reflects the complexity of this process.

One of the most famous theorists of
civilization in the Western world was a
professor of prehistoric archaeology, V.
Gordon Childe (1892-1957). He listed
for what constitutes a civilization still
influences our thinking: from large
urban centres; monumental

architecture; system for recording
information; development of exact and
practical sciences; interdependence of
classes to state religion/ideology.
Based on this list, some other professors
and students used different terms to
describe other forms of human
communities, which show that
civilization represented progress. I
highlighted the most important characteristics of civilizations, as follows: cultural

42

system (religion, learning and written language, art, architecture); central government
(class structure with satisfied social one); science with advanced technology and
transportation; a high degree of occupational specialization; the growth of region/
.nation and stable food supply.

It seems clear that any given civilization need have maybe all of those explained
above as a core of common characteristics of civilization. It helps to think through
the process of how town turned into cities and civilizations. Civilizations may consist
of a large population e.g. China (“A civilization pretending to be a state” - Lucian
Pyle), many countries e.g. Latin America or a single country with a (relatively) small
population e.g. Japanese. In historical research, 21 civilizations have been identified,
however not all of them exist till this day. Twenty years ago, the political scientist
Samuel Huntington declared a new phase to world politics. The fundamental source
of conflict in this new world, he wrote, will not be primarily ideological or primarily
economic, the Cold War was over and the Soviet Union was finished.

On Huntington’s map of the world’s civilizations shows the major groups of existing
civilizations, among them in which there exist respective core states and can be
grouped into six poles:

While there is no such core state in a Islamic civilization, not to mention South
America and the sub-Sahara Africa which do not yet possess the conditions necessary
for being major civilizations with implications that they do have a potential to become
distinct civilizations of their own.
**From latest to next model of civilization conflicts**

For a century and a half, the conflicts of the Western world were largely among
princes-emperors, absolute monarchs and constitutional monarchs. In the process
they created nation states, and beginning with the French Revolution the principal
lines of conflict were between nations rather than princes. In 1793, as R. R. Palmer
put it, “The wars of kings were over; the wars of peoples had begun”. The nineteenthcentury pattern lasted until the end of World War I. Then, as a result of the Russian
Revolution and the reaction against it, the conflict of nations gave up to the conflict
of ideologies, first among Communism, Fascism-Nazism and liberal democracy, and
then between commu­nism and liberal democracy. Communism demonstrates clearly:

_Are we facing the clash of civilizations?_

this workers’ paradise was a totalitarian state that created its own imperialist policy
all around the globe and was involved in several major wars from 1917 upon to
1991.

During the Cold War, this latter conflict became embodied in the struggle between
the two superpowers, nei­ther of which was a nation. Conflict between civilizations
will be the latest phase in the evolution of conflict in the modern world.

Talking on ‘90[th] the Clash of civilizations truly became political world. The 19[th]
century has been considered as a clash of nations, the 20[th] century as a clash of
ideologies and 21[st] century predicted as a clash civilization with a fundamental
religions concept, based upon religions. Currently, the balance of power among
civilizations is changing: the West is going to have a virtual influence; Asian
civilizations are growing their economic, military, and political strength; Islam is
exploding demographically with destabilizing consequences; and other civilizations
generally are reaffirming the value of their own cultures.
**Are we facing the clash of civilizations?**

The work of Samuel P. Huntington is a key source for my exploration of the civilization
exclusivity topic question. His piece “The Clash of Civilizations?” analyzes
contemporary and projected conflicts, suggesting that the clash of civilizations will
create the fodder for all conflict to follow. He proposes that prior warfare and conflict
transition from the work of monarchies, to the stuff of nation states, to the result of
ideological differences. Huntington concludes his article with a prediction that
civilization divisions and misunderstandings will fuel all debates to come.

According to Huntington theory, the civilization will clash because of five main
reasons: real and basic _differences among civilizations; the world is becoming a_
_smaller place; the growth of civilization-consciousness is enhanced by the dual role_
_of the West; cultural characteristics and differences are less mutable and hence less_
easily compromised and resolved than political and eco­nomic ones, finally, economic
_regionalism is increasing._
**Two decades after Huntington’s “clash of civilization”**

We are now 20 years after Huntington issued his thoughts about clash of civilizations.
I tried to draw together the most important kinds of critics, concentrated in three
different powerful prisms which history confirmed:

-  Inter civilization conflicts, which means not between civilizations but within

civilizations conflicts, like: the real ethnic conflicts (1990); the conflict
remains between nations/centuries and between secularism and Islam/Sunnis
and Shiai’ts.

-  Super civilizations, which consist in spreading globalizations; increasing

Universal Norms of Human Rights.

-  Multiple of ideas, focused not in or under different civilizations, but as a

fact that civilization is a mental construct, just a matter what you think: your
identity is.

What does the history tells us through last twenty years about five main civilizations:

44


-----

_Colonel Dilaver Hoxha_

**Islamic civilization. Overall, the realities of today confirm intra conflicts are l**
ongoing.

Referring to the latest attacks, like 9/11 tragedy, Afghanistan and Iraqi wars, US
invention focused on its effort and democracy promotion, further confirmed the
clash of civilization even US forced to promote an ideology of liberal democracy.

-  Today Iraq (US is out now), Intra civilization conflict is continuing there

between the Sunnis and the Shias sect, which is religions basis conflicts.

-  Arab spring, which rapidly becoming an Islam Atom. Islam Brotherhood

takes power in Egypt. What is going on there have been reflected in Syria,
which is just not only conflict between liberal democracy and secularism,
but it is also a conflict between the Sunnis/Shias and it has the similarities
with conflict in Iraq.

-  Apparently, it will happen in the future when Iran gets nuclear weapons, this

is going to sharpen the conflict between West and Islam.

**Confucian/ Chinese civilization. During 1990-2000, the Olympics gave a chance**
to develop China. It was modernizing, globalizing, and liberalizing. It was sharp
offensive and responsible as a stake holder in the global economy design by US in
yearly decades. It largely confirms the Fukuyama thoughts, which Beijing consensus,
to replace Washington consensus, which was so dominant 1990, focused on economic
development dominant with increasing popular prosperity under moral hierarchal
authority. The situation in China shows that South China people think differently
with north China; people in Hon Kong think different than people in Beijing. There
is a different mentality, which ones making Chinese policy, ones Chinese ideology,
once making shaping Chinese future updates the 21[st] century. Looking of the future,
shows the clash between Chinese and Islamic civilization, the continuation of West
and Islamic civilization.

Chinese population thinks and talks about 100 years of Affiliation (1842-1949).
Today they are talking about for next 100 years of whole redemption, preparing for
next Affiliation 2049-Redemption of China to be proclamation (the celebration of
the full world power-as Chin dynasty during 18 century). A Chinese view is that: 18
century is Chinese century, 19 century as an England century, 20 century American
century and 21[st] the full redemption of proclamation as a Chinese century (2049).
The Chinese civilization is going to shrink based on “one child policy” projected to
be revised.

**Western** **civilization. What has happened to at third of civilization/west itself? In**
1990[th], under leadership of US where peripheral conflicts, which there are still
ongoing. Western remains western and America will remain America. Based on an
American Ideology as Washington Consensus, the question will be what are these
values? Huntington believed that the core values of 21[st] century had been as core
principles through 21[st] century called as the American creed with 6 principals: Liberty
under low; equality of opportunity for all; limited Government, institutionalized
with three other principals: constitutionalism, liberal democracy and market economy.

Going back in 1950, West versus to East in this age of ideology there was a great

_Are we facing the clash of civilizations?_

deal of many ideas which seem to be national state of affairs and they will retain
next 50 years. In 1990 sustained too many concepts: Multiculturalism, Post
Modernism, Post America, Post west. The western civilization is virtually in America
and in Europe. No one talked about Western civilization in America and Europe
today, but others are talking about west, the rest talked about “One time powerful
are still arrogant oppressive” that is a term west means most the time used. Instead
East and Europe do not talk about West, but talk globalization and human rights.

Too many in America believe in globalization and universal human rights. People
are identifying each other as US, but as one state of US (Pennsylvania, etc). People
in America are not equipped by moral between civilizations, which is a cultural
reality. The economic crisis began in 2010, which is better in America than Europe.
It happens in Europe, but America is incapable to help Europe, what it did before to
take leadership like 1945. What is infecting in daily life of people in west and in
Europe and America, a concept of western civilization is not operational. The reality
of today does not feet nicely like in 1990. We can certainly see inter civilization
conflicts much greater any time since 1930 (class conflict) and since 1910 (ethnic
conflict of emigration) the conflict of congress) which is more divided than any
time since 1850 (the politic conflict over slavery).

The people still believe to spread the west culture, however, Huntington perspective
(2004, who are we?) has been changed the challenge to America identity. He talked
how the American lead had become to define the globalism, how the American
population extremely of individualism. He would be confirmed with the reality
today, by developments Islamic and Chinese civilizations, expressing individualism.
The best alternative is to believe in principals as Huntington believed in deeply in
principals to practice and promote them (6 principles). As a long there are people
that practice and promote based on principals there will be a clash of civilization

**Hindu Civilization. It is growing relatively normal. There was a Hindu nationalist**
party came to power, which present Hindu state. They were very western and
presented Hinduism (Indian Ocean and South/South East Asia) but this party has
been corrupted and it left the government and the congress party replace it. The real
Hindu civilization stands up with the distinctively Hindu characteristics and Hindu
foreign policy which is different than traditional Chinese and west policies. There
is a Hindu strategic policy and it is advantage for US. America can split Islam
between Sunny and _Shias, which can certainly split the civilizations and Chinese_
and Islamic both can make in conflict and the both are in conflict with Indian.
Americans can support the rising Hindu civilizations that can help contains Islamic
civilization to the West and Chinese civilization to the East.

**Eastern Orthodox Civilization in Russia. We can believe in the civilization of**
dynamic, which one of them is orthodox. Russian civilization, Eastern orthodox are
different. Russians are truly believers, which have enemies around. They see all
sides a clash of civilization. Regarding any clash of civilization, Russia would push
to west (Baltic’s), East (solidify the Russian Far East), and South (not just beyond
Georgia and Armenia but Azerbaijan, Iran and beyond). The Russian population
has had the greatest planet of any society in peace time recording in History. They

46

_Colonel Dilaver Hoxha_

simply do not have demographic strength/graphics to sustain a clash of civilization.

As a conclusion, Huntington stretched very well, number of important things between
now and then including the future: the continuing bloody borders between Islam
and West; Iraq and US invasion; armed conflicts military/ incidents; or what is going
happen between US navy and China Navy which will be a catastrophic for the future.
Significant Conflicts with Islam’s, the next strange conflict will be in the middle
Este will be between Sunnis and Shia’s

With all great intellections and theorist, he never wrote systemically about economics,
which are extremely important. Today we are facing the Financial Crisis, which
happened as an economic crisis before, and this one. This one has far more effect
which different with yearly crisis. In the earlier crisis are testified the economy:
Agriculture (1890), Economy (1930 and 1970) and Finance which started in 2010.
Financial crises and is different one.

Based on eight sorts of civilization (African, Eastern Orthodox, Hindu, Islamic,
Japanese, Latin American, Confucian/Sinic & Western) rather than the bipolar power
structure of the last half of the 20[th] Century, now it is multi polar and multi civilisation.
The statistics show that, the West is and will remain the most powerful civilization
for next 25 years.
**The main reasons that we are facing the clash of civilizations**

It’s always a clash of civilizations in, since we have many differences in culture,
religions, economy, natural recourses, mentality, etc. Let point out some of them:
**From basic differences to highest one**

Humans are the same, but civilizations in their basics values differ. Civilizations are
fundamentally unique from one to another. Today we are facing increasing trade,
travel, immigration and cultural exchanges. Also foreigners are competing for jobs,
social services, and cultural superiority. Europe observers a rise in anti-immigrant
and anti-Muslim feeling. In one side, the civilization gives the world democracy: the
concept of rights, scientists, perspective in art, modern science, and technology. On
the other side, the civilization which gives to the world chaos. It is supporting by
different groups of extremists that use or exactly abuse with people which mostly are
poor and uneducated. Usually it comes from the mentality, the level of life styling or
education which makes the confrontation.

The difference is also between country’s cultures and believers. We know that people
get a privilege to meet each other from over the world. All are similar with the same
dreams and they wish to live with dignity and freedom. However they are living in
many different levels of reality (reach & poor education or not). The differences to
be avoided are colour, belief, music, language, etc.

Usually is a human tendency to look for others in times of difficulty. The prosperity,
not adversity is the real test of how we define community. The prosperity, not adversity,
is the real test of how we define community. E.g. South Africa, Central America,
Afghanistan testifies to this tendency. In additional ‘West’ rises to the peak of its power
and shows a confronting all non-western civilizations through economics and warfare.

47


-----

_Are we facing the clash of civilizations?_

Another examples of differences is considering the world in two parts, first one is
how to increase one’s sphere of influence, and second si Thinking is how to increase
surviving. Till we learn that more may not be better, or development does not mean
destruction of the planet, rather than you using money, money uses us.

**Differences in economy. China has become the USA’s biggest trade partner; Western**
investments in Arab countries are significant. Huntington had foreseen an unclear
continuation of the post-WW2. Alliance between the Westerns, produced global trade,
however we are facing financial and banking crises today. Some nations are paying
the economic cost of not participating in a global economy.

If wars are an extension of politics, and politics an extension of economics-it is
economics that will fuel international agendas & alliances of the future.
**Proliferation of technology, social-media and**
**other trends that challenge civilization prescriptions**

Ideas and technology have always spread attractively which shows that the modern
communications technology allows change cultures. It supports sharing of information
and ideas, which go through national and civilization boundaries. In the same time
globalization gives a huge impact that makes borders porous & trade allow culture to
spread up. All these seem to bring the civilizations together and reschedule differences.

Today media is informing us for everything and it is one of object that needs to be
looked into. Instead of being separated, media is linked with the political sides and
also instead of integrating them, we are splitting them. All generates a lot of fear
from both sides.

Other events that challenges clash are: the constant infighting in Africa, regional
leadership struggle (Egypt vs. Turkey), China’s no-conflict policy, growth of
substantial, enfranchised diasporas communities in the West, collaboration to protect
overseas investments. In additional, fault lines have also exploded into conflict
between Hindus and Muslims, Chinese and Buddhist Tibetans, Japan and the European
and American West, and in the “new Cold War” between China and the United States.
Although not all of these clashes will be characterized by violence, the conflicts
occurring along Islamic fault lines appear most threatening.
**How we can avoid the clash of civilizations?**

_“In order to create a happy century, a peaceful century we must promote the concept_
_of dialogue.” has said Dalai Lama._

What can we do to reaching the concept of this dialogue?

-  A need to act together, see each other eyes to eyes and arrange meeting with
a good discussion. Instead of debate needs to have a dialogue furthermore it
is a need bringing together intellectuals, and the sustained discussions of
critical issues

-  Those events should be a subject of finding which tasks we are facing from
East & West, time and place to solve problems and finding a good solution
for relationship of religion and the state.

48


-----

_Colonel Dilaver Hoxha_

-  The goal is instead of clash of civilizations to reach a global civil society. It
takes time with hard work to be done to reach a shared understanding of
civil society and the human rights.

-  Making real progress toward the global civil society by giving suggestions
from both sides understanding each other to be more consistent when it comes
to advocate democracy and human rights.

-  The most important to be maintain is providing and promoting the modern
education for the new generation.

-  No needs required for underestimating or overestimating of influence in our
societies, but looking for building and contributing to the democracy and
civil society together.

-  The world should have a new civilization which connects with its other
members.

All will have an effect to make this great change in our world: “Replacing the clash
of civilizations with a global civil society leading by universal human principles and
using tolerance.

Finally, it is simple to understand this picture. When we shake hands, first, we can
think in the same direction, understand and respect each other to protect our life;
second, we should overcome all clashes, whatever they are, to avoid destruction of
our planet and third, only together, we can produce peace and stability and make our
life enjoyable.

_Influence of the Cold War on the realism_


##### Influence of the Cold War on the realism

Colonel PhD Metodija Dojcinovski

Senior Course on Security and Defence Studies, 5[th], 2013

**Short commentary. The end of the Cold War** _represents the beginning of the period_
_of modern research of security issues and theories of modern warfare. End of the_
_Cold War, led to an emphasis of a large number of military-security and political_
_issues related to the survival of the state and the region, establishing a regime change_
_in political arrangements, regional cooperation, the Euro Atlantic integration and_
_many other. Studies of this period coincided with some very important events in geo-_
_strategic map of the world, especially in south-east Europe, with emphasis as most_
_important: decomposition Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, the wars in Africa, the crisis_
_in the Balkans and the Middle East, terrorist attack the U.S., beginning of the global_
_war against terrorism, the Arab Spring and other._

_In such circumstances, the current security theories point to characteristics of national_
_security crises in period of its existence. On the basis of that, to compile time analysis_
_for the period before the war, during and after performances periods wars, which_
_shall be established strategy of the modern world. One of the contemporary security_
_theories is a theory of realism. It is believed that realism in the relations between_
_strategy, security studies, international relations and political science. At the end of_
_the paper, will be definite the impact on the development of modern realism and_
_determination of society, confirming or rejecting the possibility of external influence_
_and the effects of the interior effects to the national interests and security, in general._

**The realism as a contemporary security theory**

decided to not work for the majority, but for us privileged minority, and many other
practical theories have influenced the development of democratic processes, in
particular, scientific and technological development, in search of safety between
political entities, such as the theory of realism[1].

Realism as a theory, teaching and ideology, has become a necessity, which reflect the
will of the peoples, the nations desire, determination of national interests of states,
and the world meant “balance of power”, as well as many other wars in human
history. The impact of “global realism” in the Cold War refutes radical developments,
establishing new modern security theories and new security schools, for which
weakened the influence of the theory of realism. The discipline of international
relations, leading to progressive thinking, because it was realism prefix “irealistichen”.
Access points to the new rules regarding the theory of strength, standing on the side
of power, representing the interests of power[2]. In such circumstances, academic
relationships are redefined, because if there is no crisis, no academic discipline[3].
Sub-discipline of security studies dominated realists, was created during the Cold
War.

It is impossible to write about the theory of realism, not to touch a security study that
emerged from the Cold War. Modern security theory, that left as the only proven, in
practice was the theory of realism, which represents the theory and ideology.
Discussions concerning the strengths and weaknesses of the theory of realism play a
key role in international academic circles. Authors that are more contemporary
elaborate theory of realism in connection with international relations in the past fifty
years[4]. At the same time, security processes and theories of realism are also important
for studies that are studied this problem, emphasizing the important role of security
studies. Any interested in safety factor should be given to or familiar with realism,
because of his influence, but because of his contact with direct involvement in the
practice. Realism in practice is treated as a family of ideas, because of similarities
and the distinctive expression. Key positions of realism focused on governmental
structure and its diversity in practice, separating the two sides’ authors as defensive
realists and offensive realists. Defensive realism emphasizes the ability level of
security in the anarchy, while offensive realism is represented by the use of maximum
force. Between these two types of realism, there is a line-oriented material realist.

During the Cold War, realism was greatly criticized. But realism has never left the
scene, neither turned in another direction. Good realists do not allow them self to
become a target of unnecessary, illegal and unpopular war. Realism requires careful
use of military power in accordance with the political orientation of the state.

_Influence of the Cold War on the realism_

Therefore, realism does not permit generalization complex tradition and connection
with the three important elements: existing, doing and knowing. For realists, the first
references object characteristics and the existence of the states existence, as an actor
in international politics and was the biggest champion of the people, the citizens.
One of the important aspects of realisms knowledge, as the dominant method of
positivism (understanding as a empirical qualification). Practice knowledge is created
by the theory, such as the politic is created from ethics. This contributes to the
development of ideas concerning the security of countries, types of threats, the
participation of people and another. The third aspect achieves the objective, at the
moment of creating a compatible environment for defining the necessary policies.

**_Realism. The emergence of true realism is the period when the world decided to_**
redefine under existing international rules, norms and regulations on the one hand
and development, power and influence of the state on the other. The period of influence
and creating contemporary realism, are 50s of last century, when its representatives
Herman Kan, Bernard Broody, Henri Kissinger, Albert Volesteler, Tomas Shelling,
and other experts, state leaders and representatives of security schools are agreed
that the basis of the theory and politics of realism, lies in the lack of a guiding force
and maintaining the “balance of power”. The period, in which states retained their
positions and created a traditional approach to reality, researchers allow this matter
to be called “traditionalists”. Modern realism, exist over 50 years ago, when after
the Cold War, not to allow the world to lead one country, or one superpower.

By recognizing the effects of growth conditions, opportunities, development processes
and “the politics of globalization”, the main goal of the theory of realism and countries
in the real world has become a “national interest”. This approach led to a redefinition
of many security and political issues, especially after the Cold War. The real view of
world order and the interests of the world are upset with their thinking that the end of
the Cold War has weakened the influence of realism. The theory of realism is a
reflection of the time, so this conclusion could be based on the results slowed and
inefficient respond to threats around the world, where the results after the Cold War:
persecution of about 5,000,000 people every year; about 600,000 die from various
reason; each year, depleting 10-11,000,000 people; around 25,000,000 people mass
displacement worldwide. The number of cases is increasing and it is difficult to
determine, and the dark figure of crime is on the rise. World faces new face of
terrorism, “suicide attacks”[5].

The basis of the theory of realism in safety studies as part of the science of international
relations, which was mostly interested in maintaining security between actors and
people, traditional domestic political concerns, health and rights of people, the global
political agenda and developments in other countries, disasters and massacres.
Alternative views are pointing to the fact that the subject of research of realism
should go beyond the scope of threats[6]. Many of the realists, the idea of  national

interest seeing in foreign policy, which as reality, continues after the Second World
War to the present. Every government act according to the interests of their people.
His influence realism reduces with the theories, ideas, understanding, that, the national
interest declines if signed agreements with countries and governments who oppress
their own people. As a supporter of this theory and author of the concept, Morgenthau
in 1982 was behind the fact that the main goal of a state should be the integrity of the
state, “its political institutions and culture”.

However, this concept does not coincide with the European policy for “pooling of
sovereignty”[7]. However, this concept today defended many governments in the world
using the term “national interest”[8]. Realism in the post-Cold War has different
approaches and perspectives. Each approach to modern views on the reality of the
world and its definition provides various assumptions and explanations about the
consequences and assumptions. Thus, realism is transformed into pursuing types
and periods: classical realism, neoclassical “realism of rise and fall” and “neo-realism”
(offensive structural and defensive structural)[9]. Each one is different and distinctive,
but most pessimistic realists see international relations, although they are part of
their research and interest.

**_Classical Realism. Classical realism in 20th century dates from a time when in 1939_**
marked the first works. Classical realism is characterized by answering the thenliberalism on issues of international politics and widely widespread liberalism in the
period between the two world wars. The essence of classical realism is fighting
states to increase their capabilities and power. On the other hand, classical realism
explores conflicts about human weaknesses. For classical realists, politics is
characterized as the devil, for evil actions that people do in implementing the policy.

**_Neorealism. The theory of Kenneth Waltz in 1979_** [10], replaced the theory of
Morgenthau as an obstacle to the implementation of realism. Theory of International
Politics argues that systems are composed of structure and related units interact.
This results in the phrase “what states want” and “what states have”.

**_Defensive structural realism. Defensive structural realism originates from neo-_**
realism, after the Cold War, but apart from him. This type of realism argues that
states all their own way provide protection in international frames, but the biggest
threats come from other countries.

**_Offensive structural realism. This theory arguing that states can still take advantage_**
of their potential for participation in the international politics and used his position

sense pretsatvuvashe a political system. Realism was expanding at the expense of pessimism, with
either very quickly understood that the world may not exist leading countries to increase their power
and protecting the most powerful among themselves.
7 As an example, Morgenthau and Kissinger openly debated for U.S. participation in the war in Vietnam,
“whether it is in the national interest of the country”.
8 Foreign Minister Downer of Australia, in 2002 said, “The government is confident that the national
interest of Australia has increased the ambitious and reasonable manner ... If you did not raise yourself,
nobody will increase”.

and power, against another state[11]. Such approach draws five assumptions pertaining
to the following: the international system is anarchic; great powers inherently possess
offensive military capability that can harm one another, states can never be identically
directed toward another; survival is the primary goal of large powers and great powers
are rational actors in the world. From these assumptions it can be concluded that the
great powers fear each other because they devote greater attention to safety and
build better strategy for their survival.

**_Realism of rise and fall. This species occurs in the theory of time, the, “balance of_**
power” in 1950[12]. The interest of theory is facing the problem of money-power in
international relations, in which the dominant role played politics of hegemony as a
basis for peace. In this way, only the dominant states are in a position to shape the
rules and policies of the international community, with the addition of other appetites
will be satisfied and their own. When the state becomes indifferent, various factors
affecting the threat of war. In the absence of preventive actions and efforts, the threat
of war can be more certain. The “rise and fall” of realism, depicts human reality and
history or a significant part of it. This theory suggests the need for programs to
promote events in different ways and at different times. And this type of realistic
points of internal developments in the states, which can be positive and negative
(industrialization, social issues, economic system, military, technological and
economic innovation, and more. Programs rise and fall causing many transition
theories and research models beginnings and the possibility of wars[13].

**_Neoclassical realism. Neoclassical realism is based on developing solutions and_**
analysis relating to foreign policy and implemented for internal use. Implement
segments for monitoring of foreign policy. The reason for the need of such a theory
is ambiguous picture to the States comes from within. The outer scene is hard to see
threats and opportunities, because the agenda to meet strategic purposes is infinite.

Previous chapter suggests on tradition of realism as showcases for his outstanding
adaptation of important events. Along with realism, its place we find theorists,
politicians, researchers and all other factors expert and political scene. The
development of realism is implemented through several areas, the most important
being: 1. Object of interest of the realism are predictions and threats, which means
different realistic theories worked out different things. For example, structural realism
suggests a joint action with respect to threats, while defensive structural realism
suggests peaceful means of distracting the existence of a threat and refrain from use
of offensive assets. 2. The capacity to change the realism opens the possibility of
some criticism. Realists squabbled over the newly created theories for application
anomalies obtained from empirical results. Consequently, theories of realism became

vague, coherent and specific. 3. Despite internal divisions among realists, this theory
continues to be a central contributor to the building of national policy and development
of safety and security studies. Realism as a theory emerges as the winner in the
security environment, especially after the Cold War had significant explanations and
understanding the causes of conflict and war.
**Does weakening the impact of realism have a lasting effect?**

Twentieth century was the period in which the state came to the fore because of the
relationship between people and countries, which appear in the twenty-first century,
went into history. States today have lost the care for people and are focused on other
routes. But we must not forget that security as a term has a complex meaning. In
Latin, the word security is written as “sine cura”, which means “without care”. The
total release from care is impractical and undesirable, because life without worry is
imagined and eliminates any scientific progress. As such, the theory in real life (safety)
in international studies and global politics, focusing on the biggest fears, cares and
threats to people. If there is no danger, no security, institutions will not exist, the
theory will not have, will not the practice, will not science. Not only realism but also
other pyramids cleared the possibility of war. In the new global order after the Cold
War, realism turned to survey the security issues sidelined myriad world powers
began to throw them on the table. National interests of states are looking at the
actions of the threats to the state. The theory of realism accepts narrowing the focus
of interest, especially after the Cold War. Representatives of this theory claim that
just war threats prevailed during the Cold War. But realism is the only theory that
fights for the concept of national interests and national security[14]. The U.S. government
has dominated since the use of the prefix “national” government rhetoric always
persuaded people to stand behind the government[15]. Reason for a nuclear threat during
the Cold War, has contributed to awaken the national interest, to unite people and
make security shield.

Realism constantly sticks to the term security, access and the state is key to securing
the lives of citizens[16]. The term security has huge significance in actual political
work, as threats to the state and people. Real is the need for security at a global level,
recognized before the end of the Cold War. Defining the issue of security, but there
are theoretical and realistic significance. Realistic way of defining security suggests
that military issues are security and as such should be given priority by governments
in terms of some “low-politics” issues[17]. Security known to be due to differences in

14 Walter Lipman 1943: Preliminary creator of the term “Cold War”, said, “A country is safe when not
sacrifice legitimate interests to avoid war and is willing to hold through the war”.
15 Hans Morgentau: American Academy (father of realism) in the 50s, said: “The situation of the state
is high, its power and sovereignty are joining the biggest concerns in external affairs”.
16 Meksvini 1999: claims that security will become an adjective. He believes that military power and the
application of national interest can be positive and negative factors of safety. The concept of national
interest came to the fore because of the freezing of international relations in the period 1945-1990.
17 World Health Organization: in 2002 published research on the causes of deaths in the world in which
the order is as follows: 91% diseases, accidents 4.1%, 2.1% traffic accidents, suicides 1.5%, 0.9%
killing, collective violence, 0.4% and 0.5% natural disasters.

subjective estimates with actual threats. In international relations, traditional real
opinion leads to the claim that the greatest value is state sovereignty (domestic and
foreign policy). It is clear that the priority is given to public safety. In democratic
countries is the most important individual security. Questions of life and death on a
global level are treated as priority because it does not fit into national policy.

The search for profit, enrich ones, depletes others. Realism is the basis for state
interests, and ensuring the security and military issues. Realist paradigm will continue
to dominate the global level, and will extend across all areas of society, especially
the non-military issues and interests of the individual. The last two decades of the
20th century, are essential for mankind in order to comply with the world of theory
of the current situation. However, the impact of modern warfare, leave traces on
theories about the causes of conflicts and the negative development of the international
community. In the modern world, there are three main groups of causes globally
enabling warfare, including:

1. During the “Cold War” (anti-colonial reasons, ideological confrontation, socialist
revolution, territorial and national distinction).

2. The period of the Cold War to the present (continuity of unsolved problemscauses, conflict in post-socialism republics, war against the dictatorial and totalitarian
systems, international military interventions under the UN).

3. Conflicts in the near future (continuity of unsolved problems - causes, conflict
with future superpowers and establishing a new world order, fight for vital living
space and natural resources, civilization conflicts, opposition to various civilizations).
**Conclusion**

The theory of realism and its impact on humanity will never fade, but that over the
time, will continually transform to another form, which will allow the foundation to
last. The concept of realism after the Cold War, its weakening becomes the new
approach, which provides a new beginning, a new design, contemporary
transformation. The previous “national interests” realism transform into new
evolutionary approaches that are identified as military security, security societies,
political security, economic security, and others. After the Cold War, the realism, use
security studies as a tool for monitoring and opposition to the new, with appropriate
safety concept. Thus, the focus of interest rather than traditional threats are now
asymmetric threats and risks and fourth-generation warfare, rather than military might
arise economic and diplomatic aspects, rather than individual security apply collective
security, or “Smart Defence” concept. The realism in a future will presents
contemporary direction, strategy, foundation for further development and
modernization of national capacities, particularly the implementation of the national
interests of countries at local and global level, as well.

##### Leadership and its social responsibility

**Short commentary. Not only for the outstanding history personalities, but even**
_nowadays in everyday life we can hear people singing praises to individuals or_
_certain groups of people from different fields of activity. For instance, we hear people_
_say for a group of young skilful students, “they will be the leaders of the future”; for_
_a number of soldiers tested in difficult missions that “they are the future leaders of_
_the Armed Forces” etc. You can hear people express in the same way for other fields_
_of life like politics, economy, science, art etc._

_The question arises: are there any fundamental elements present in leadership in all_
_historical periods, regardless of the fact that their appearance in each stage bears_
_the modifications of the time? That is, can you just explain the phenomenon of_
_leadership within Weber’s dichotomy – leader-disciple, or leadership is a social_
_phenomenon, whose content is the resultant of the action of many variables like_
_social and historical forces, which a real leader takes into account, as the product of_
_historical era he belongs to, including the so-called process of socialization?_

ociological studies indicate that in the composition of the leadership
phenomenon should we should distinguish: a) the leadership and management
process, b) the individual as leader or manager, and c) the function or role of

# Smanagement, its products. As rightly pointed out, leadership is a delicate combination

of process management techniques, with specific gifts, outstanding peculiarities of
the leader’s personality, as well as the general social requirements for the fulfilment
of this function.[1] From this perspective we understand that the concept of leadership
can and should be distinguished from our own subjective judgments, we can
understand what leadership is and who it is in a given moment, even though the
phenomenon of leadership is better studied in close connection with the execution
of tasks and function by certain people in a certain time.

This paper intends to study the phenomenon of leadership despite the different areas
of activity where it leads, by focusing on social type of leader, on one of the most
essential features that it should embody to meet the expectations that current Albanian
society has for its role and achievements and its social responsibility as well.

**On social determining elements of leadership**

The phenomenon of leadership has attracted the attention of researchers and there
are numerous sociological, political, psychological and managerial studies in this
field. Suffice to say that the deeper explanation of leadership issue does not seem
difficult due to lack of research and studies in this field, but rather the general lack of
approval on what are the inherent fundamental elements that each leader should
bear; what are his essential leadership functions. However, sociological studies on
leadership in various fields of human activity distinguish some social elements that
are found at all leaders during all times in modern history, in their relations with
other groups of people. In the context of relations of the leader with the people that
follow him, leaders are classified in this way: first, leaders who push people for
action; secondly, come those who are defined as exponents among people. Through
their influence and sympathy they enjoy among people they personify experiences,
desires, ambitions and their goals for a certain period of time; thirdly, there are the
so-called representatives of the masses, elected by them in a legal way as
representatives of a certain social group and; finally, there are leaders who ‘build’
the masses themselves, the so-called constructive leaders who group, organize, inspire
and lead their followers to achieve certain social objectives.[2]

The fourth type of leader best meets the features that the current Albanian leadership
should embody in various fields of social, political, scientific, business activity, and
in management of processes of civil society organizations and military ones. This
type of leader is presented as a social product, aware that he is not an entity based on
the self, or appointed to that role by himself, but rather it is a denial of his ego. For
such kind of leader the idea of a centralized autocratic authority is alien.

Nowadays for our democratic societies, the emergence of a leader who builds his
personality not only in the political field, but also in other areas, through techniques
of oppression and coercion, through imposing his illegitimate thought and will, creates
shocking effects. Such assessments like “charismatic leader” or “leader of the nation”
that have circulated in recent decades-typical for traditional societies of a distant
past-are primitive and authoritarian reminiscences, inconsistent with the spirit of the
ongoing process of rationalization in the modern capitalist society, the essence of
which was widely discussed in the early 20’s of last century by the German sociologist
Max Weber. While he considered typical the types of rational legitimacy for the
modern capitalist society, he considered the kinds of traditional and charismatic
legitimacy as something related to backward and traditional societies, whose
vindication is achieved by blind obedience to the old customs and traditions, or to
the alleged extraordinary qualities and almost mystical of an autocratic leader. Given

_Leadership and its social responsibility_

Weber’s concept of rationalization as a global process of development of life in all
its sectors in the political field rationalization outlines the substantial difference
between autocracy and democracy, because the first relies on the assumption of the
divine or mystical will embodied in a ruler, and the second, relies on the expression
of the popular will of the nation. Regarding formal rationalization, autocracy and
democracy are respectively distinguished by the fact that the first assumption is based
on the presence of the leader’s charisma, while the second in legality, i.e. the
legitimacy of democratic procedures of elections, both in the political field and other
areas of social activity.[3]

Charismatic leader of the undemocratic past was typical in a social environment that
did not impose him any sense of responsibility to his followers or to the society in
general. That kind of leader mainly did not address the rationality of the crowd that
followed him, but their blind instincts and passions generally dazzled by the effect
of his charisma. In today’s democratic society one of the inherent features of a leader’s
and constructive leadership is the responsibility, understood as responsibility toward
the followers for honest leadership in order to protect their interests and the fulfill
the major goals of the community and society, at the same time as a liability to the
tasks of the time and its claims that go beyond the interests of particular communities.

The 22 years experience of pluralism in our country shows numerous cases of positive
achievements that have been accomplished thanks to the role of the Albanian
leadership, regardless of any political party. We are all aware that Albania of 2013
differs from Albania of 1990. However, the repeated failures of the Albanian leadership
to implement the required reforms for the country’s integration into the European
Union, the third rejection by the European institutions responsible for giving Albania
the candidate status for EU member during 2012,[4] shed light on the lack of a very
important aspect in the activity of the Albanian leadership and on its internal
constitution-in terms of responsibility. All surveys and sociological studies in the
last two decades have shown that the vast majority of the Albanian population,
regardless of political orientation and political affiliation, has claimed the country’s
membership in the EU and Euro-Atlantic structures. From this perspective, it should
be highlighted that the responsibility of the Albanian leadership to achieve this major
objective as soon as possible by carrying out the required reforms had to be much
greater. Apparently we seem to be in a paradoxical situation-should the horses pull
the cart, or the cart should push the horses ahead.

Low level of responsibility in leadership to the extent really perceived by the common
Albanian deserves to be examined more completely. Actually this low level of
responsibility should be regarded as a deficit of rational leadership in the Albanian

society? For the true and constructive leader is accountable not only to the narrow
political group of his close devotees, who do not resemble the followers of autocratic
charismatic leader, overwhelmed by the fever of blind passions, by hatred for the
political opponents, and the greed of direct gain through methods of corruption,
nepotism and clientelism. When it comes to constructive and rational leader, leadership
should not be confused with the practice of construction and utilization of clientelism.
Constructive political leader is accountable not only to the followers of his narrow
circle but he must be accountable to the country for the achievement and nonachievement of the objectives that his country has at the time he is a leader. In this
sense political leader should not estimate as his followers only separate factions
within the mass of the people, but within the certain time limits of the mandate attained
democratically; he should lead the whole masses of the country; render account to
them; he must express and protect their fundamental interests, aspirations and
expectations.

Today’s constructive leader of the democratic society is not immune from the possible
infections by the manifestation of what the French political scientist Alexis de
Tocqueville called the “tyranny of the majority” which is manifested through efforts
made by certain leaders or political forces “to artificially increase the natural strength
of the majority”.[5]Nowadays, as illustrated by the political experience of many countries
in our region, clientelism and nepotism in the political and administrative leadership
are two instruments to increase the power of artificial political majorities out of
contested elections. The concern expressed in the Progress Report of European
Commission October 2012 on Albania is a testimony of this. This report highlights
the occurrences of a partial implementation of the laws and decisions of the Council
of Ministers on the organizational structure of public administration institutions,
refusal by central government of the requirements of Public Administration
Department, numerous cases of employment in these institutions of party militants
on temporary work contracts, in violation of the laws and professional criteria for
employment, or the phenomenon of political-party split of local authorities association,
alongside with a lack of transparency and consultation practice of local authorities
with civil society and other relevant groups of interest (stakeholders) etc.[6]

Accountability of leadership to its followers is an important aspect of his moral
integrity in the implementation of its steering function. Research shows that this
feature is present in all social, political, economic organizations etc. Scholars argue
that constructive and responsible leadership contributes to building and increase of
social capital;[7] that in business field his contribution serves the common good not
only to the so-called “ shareholder “ (as we call those who own a share of the property

in a business company), but also to the so-called stakeholders (people who do not
actually own a share of the capital of that company, but are interested in its success).
If figuratively the followers of the closest circle and clientelist of the authoritarian
leader would be called “shareholder” of its business policy, his autocratic view
prevents it to see and protect the interests of other strata and groups of interest
throughout society, that we would be called groups “stakeholders” in the framework
of the achievement of the strategic objectives of national policy.

Given the treatment of leadership as a social phenomenon, business management
theoreticians in terms of the current global crisis of capitalism, are focused on a
better understanding of the ways, means and methods of social impact on the increase
of leadership responsibility in a global pluralist society, which is called the “the
society of interested groups for its welfare and success”, or otherwise, - “global
stakeholder society”. This kind of society appeals to all interested parties for a
proactive commitment to its progress, requires from the leaders to educate
comprehensive engagement and dialogue, urges them to facilitate the development
of the legitimate debate and assist in achieving a balance between different interests
in the process of making sound decisions in morale terms.[8]

Hence, it is understandable that social events of every kind, as well as their leaders
, face with the challenge of creating a network of sustainable and complex
relationships, and by acting within them attract in the creative activity of interested
groups, namely stakeholder, in a dialogue that creates resonance, trust and ultimately,
collaborative social capital. Based on this conception, if we go back to the repeated
failure Albanian leadership to quickly integrate the country into the European Union,
we understand that the symmetry of the refusal to take into account the interests of
the other party, when the necessary responsibility to make mutual concessions on
behalf of national interests, is the most visible expression of deficit the deficit of
leadership in the political elite of the Albanian society nowadays. This situation has
created the impression in large segment of our society that the repeated symmetry of
refusal can be repeated even if we rotate political power, thus strengthening sentiments
of sceptics at home and in Europe, whether the current Albanian political class wants
to integrate the country into the European Union or not.

Certainly, even in an advanced democratic society, when it comes to leadership we
mean the totality of the relationships between the leader and his followers at different
levels of social organization. But in cases when the leader organizes his followers,
he must take into account the interests, engagements and expectations even of other
socially organized groups that in a more or less democratic society are not considered
hostile groups that should be suppressed and destroyed. A leader with democratic
formation first of all awakens in the group he leads the desire to express their opinion
and attitude and does not exert force or does not try to manipulate to suppress the
individual tendencies of his followers. His word is varies and stimulates the expression
of various impulsive and instinct elements in the original nature of his followers, for
the benefit of their mobilization in order to achieve important social objectives of
the community he leads.

Property of community life and unity of his action in this way can go through
strengthening the impulsive tendencies for a change at each individual. Under this
kind of leadership, the followers being encouraged in their impulses towards building
a community life, as an expression of participation in the construction of the group,
is likely to enjoy the pleasure and stimulation of several other trends, the impact on
competitive groups in the way of self-affirmation of ideals and interests of the
community. In short, mutual harassment of impulsive tendencies of individuals within
the group, even those between competing groups, takes the right track and gains the
awareness for change. In such a case they say that group members are allowed to
“learn by doing”, and therefore their sound judgment learns from mistakes, which a
social visionary and responsible leader highlights, explains and then guides his
followers to avoid them in the future.

Secondly, such a leader organizes the emotions and will of his followers about the
plan or program of the movement he leads, and not about his narrow and selfish
wishes or interests. He is convinced that loyalty to the cause is worth more than just
loyalty to his person. The natural result of this kind of leadership is that group members
experience the richness of group feeling and the consciousness of belonging to the
group due to their identification with the program that the leader unfolds, where
each member of the community that he leads has given a certain type of contribution
and not just with his personality traits. Self-estimation and self-respect are controlled
and disciplined by group-estimation and group-respect and, in this way, it comes to
the highest level of self-respect, be that individual or collective. If this is carried out
by all the leaders of organizations of different competing groups in a democratic
society, then it results in the addition of cooperative social capital, which is a
prerequisite for achieving political, economic, cultural and other common strategic
objectives from all the competing groups in a democratic society.

The deficit of leadership in the current Albanian society has led to a lack of cooperation
and constructive dialogue among all competitive political and social forces. This
deficit is no longer secret or unknown. Evidences of this leadership deficit are reflected
in the entire progress report of European Commission on Albania in the period 20062012: “Periods of political deadlock in the spring summer 2006 hampered parliament’s
efforts to agree on important reforms issues, especially those that require broad
political consensus”[9]; “the culture of dialogue between the main political parties
deteriorated before the election; ...in general, political dialogue, a key European
Partnership priority, should be reestablished on track”[10]; “...despite constitutional
provisions, there is enough evidence about the lack of parliamentary supervision
over the executive (government) and the parliament does not function as an
independent institution ... parliamentary work for the adoption of laws and surveillance
functions bears the evident stamp of difficult political dialogue and often not
constructive. Since June 2009, parliamentary work is overshadowed and undermined
by political stalemate”[11]; “violent incidents of 21 January 2011 that led to the murder

of four protesters, further added to the climate of distrust not only between political
forces, but also between state institutions...; All this situation diverted the attention
from the so much wanted political reforms for integration into the European Union”[12].
**Modern leader, expertise and leadership structure**

Any type of organization, whether economic, political, scientific, administrative,
etc., has its own structure. At the top of each structure, even in the composing units,
normally there are certain people. But that does not mean that the person designated
at top of these structures should have the qualities required from a leader nowadays.
John Gardner is right when he states: “leadership should never be confused with
status, power, position, rank or title. Even in large corporations and government
agencies the person of the highest position may be the bureaucrat number one.”[13]

The question is: Does the leader emerge spontaneously and as an isolated person and
takes the lead of a given or emerging organization or the leader is moulded, tempered
and formed as a social phenomenon? There are two approaches regarding the answer
to this question: determinism and non-determinism. If by non-determinism, the
emergence of a leader is totally spontaneous, according to determinism, at a given
moment of social development, when before a company or an organization there are
major challenges to face, when that company or organization has succeeded and
failed several times fighting to overcome the obstacles that lie ahead, when gradually
the conditions and means are created for surmounting them, that Is the time when the
leaders emerge to guide their followers in a given society or organization to achieve
success and meet their strategic objectives.

But they do not emerge completely in a given moment; they are groomed and grown
gradually. This growth means not just collecting experience and leadership skills,
but also expertise in various fields of activity. The leader of the large size organizations
should first be distinguished and become known in public, in smaller organizations.
It is exactly these small organizations that mould the future leaders of large
organizations. Leadership in these professional, economic, military organizations,
etc. is more associated with the expertise in key areas of action of those organizations.
Anyway, expertise is one side of the coin; certainly it should be supplemented with
some other inherent qualities of a leader. In the Armed Forces, for example, alongside
with expertise leadership requires, loyalty to the profession, vision, integrity and
respect for colleagues and subordinates, strong character and, ability to make decisions
under stress and difficult conditions; the same can be said for organizations like
those of lawyers where scrupulous honesty, tranquillity and balance in decisionmaking, cooperation with colleagues and other people are crucial. Lawyers know
that to be leaders in their profession, they need to be professionally good lawyers,
capable, honest and independent in thoughts and decision-making.

The appropriate expertise makes of a professional organization leader to identify
and set in motion the best energies and skills of his subordinates. This is one of the
important responsibilities of a leader. He should rely on this knowledge to build

priorities of effective usage of these energies, especially at a time when their resources
are limited. Leadership is manifested as an ability to provide leadership and example
of “what to do”, while the administration or management skills more appear as skill
to show “how to do it.” The combination of expertise, vision and management skills
are vital for nowadays leadership, not only in small, partial and professional, but
also in the context of political parties and in the society. If such a thing does not
happen, if this combination does not function, then there are deficits in leadership,
as noted by social political developments in Albania and in our region.

Leadership in social and political life is not an isolated individualistic phenomenon.
As rightly emphasized by Brian J. Cook, though theoretically leadership is something
exercised only by individuals, it should not be allowed that individualist orientation
or a single actor completely dominate all our explanatory vision on this phenomenon.
For the construction of a particular social regime “is ultimately a collective process
…Large institutions and formal organizations exercise their direct impact on the
character of the regime. They constitute the largest part of the social substance of
that regime itself.”[14]

The leader or manager of a democratic society does not embody the organization in
various areas of social activities, does not give his “face” to each member of
organization, but tries to institutionalize it by encouraging his followers to express
themselves within it. He paves the way for the groundbreaking and creative spirit at
each ordinary member to give their contribution to community life, in order that they
see how their ideas are included in the life of the organization. Generally, the most
appropriate form of management is the creation of governing bodies - as an executive
committee or a board of directors, of an assembly of a steering committee etc., as
examples of this type of organization, comprised of individuals who represent the
elementary or functional interests of different parts of a larger social group. In this
way can be represented locality of origin, occupations, religious beliefs, gender, etc.,
giving the opportunity to all the different elements of the larger inclusive group to
give their respective contribution in its favour.

Nowadays leader or manager adjusts the old organizational structures or machine
with the new needs, and tries to avoid the creation of new structures in response to
the birth of every new need. This technique of organization is of great value because
it allows exploiting in the most comprehensive way the social values and motivating
driving forces, inherent in existing forms and teamwork skills. Modern leader or
manager does not seek here and there to invent new organizational projects that will
fit his feelings, tastes and pleasures of, or designed to create jobs for friends and
build around him a supportive clientele. He adapts forms and organizational structures
of existing agencies to cope with the new problems. Much of that impatience and
haste to create new structures seems to emanate from the reaction of those who seek
escape from the need to deal with reality and honest commitment to deal with the
fundamental issues. This is the hidden motive that often constitutes the base for the
organizational activity of the so-called leaders. Running after new structures, the

_Leadership and its social responsibility_

demagogic and noisy rhetoric about their usefulness and effectiveness mainly aims
at attracting the attention from the most basic needs that often require drastic solutions
and might have unpleasant consequences, if not catastrophic consequences for friends.
Thus, energies for real progress of the organization or community are diverted and
they are towards superficial and actions and reforms.

However, as the researchers point out, “Leadership is one of those qualities that are
better seen than heard. Those who lead do not talk much, and those who speak more,
lead less. As Shakespeare wrote, “A ship without goods makes the most noise.”
Albanians are fed up with politicians’ statements that their country is becoming a
“regional superpower” in this or that sector of economy, that the contract of X party
with the electorate is over fulfilled several times, while in reality Albania remains
the poorest country the region, the last country in the integration processes into the
European Union, one of the most obnoxious countries to join European family by
those who answer the survey questions of Euro Barometer.

Recent examples from our country and the region indicate that often, in different
fields of activity, emerge and have emerged leaders who rush to invent new
organizational structures to avoid the reorganization of their inner life, their habits
of thought and their customary sentimental experiences, by replacing them with the
external organization of new structures. Such persons who are presume that they are
“leaders” simply from the fact that they are firmly attached to the seat of government
and party leadership structures have become the most conservative and restrictive
force for the progress of their political entity and for the whole society. If this analysis
is correct, such individuals manage to deceive themselves and to convey this
misleading idea onto their followers. Even when their followers react, they suppress
the opposing voices by anti-democratic methods.

“There is a reason for everything”, King Solomon preached, there is a time you
should lead, there is also a time when you should follow somebody else. This applies
not only for the leader of an organization, but also for a business leader, for a party
leader, for a cabinet leader, etc. When success is achieved, power and glory are both
for him and for the entire organization. “There is also a time when the often ignored
expression “I do not know” should be said.”[15]

Handling of the content of leadership as a social phenomenon is inseparable from
the principle of promoting education for faithful and intelligent followers for positions
that generally execute that function. For this reason, modern leadership should use
such a technique that is based on the policy of education and training of subordinates
and followers. Basic principles of organizational activity of nowadays leader should
include the realization of self-expression of his followers, the organization of the
emotions group members about the plan or cause in a given case, in the interest of
development of a sense of loyalty, the institutionalization of the organization rather
than its personification; the use of smart methods of education for the creation of
human capacities like conferences, workshops and other forms of education in group.

Activities organized in groups can easily bring about the expansion and growth of
the group. Therefore, many organizations become ineffective. In any case, we have
to do with significant increase of the role of parts within these groups or large
structures. The effective management of the large group cannot rely on personal
contact of the leader with every member. The modern and skillful leader deems it
necessary, in various stages of group development activities, to delegate management
powers to his subordinates. It is indispensable that the leader must rely on the opinions
of experts and his subordinates accountable to him. The most valuable principle here
is to respect the opinion of a specialist, who in turn should not be trusted or over
estimated beyond his field of expertise. Beyond the perimeter of his special
professional knowledge, his opinion is rarely more reliable than that of any other
uninformed person, because it is unorganized. The great need in nowadays democratic
countries of our region is the development of leadership in all spheres of life - and
not a leadership concentrated on a few people, but a distributed and spontaneous
leadership among the broad masses of our people.

Scientific literature on the phenomenon of leadership distinguishes between formal
and informal leadership. Formal leadership is related with the leading activity of
people vested with power, i.e. with official authority, while informal leadership
implies the accumulated power and the convincing-inspiring skills of different
individuals within social communities.[16] Recognition and identification of these
individuals is not simply a matter of their personal career, but a social need for the
cultivation of the visionary leadership. Social development needs in periods of
great historical turning points, as our region has experienced in the last two to
three decades, encourage the emergence of leaders who guide the masses to their
fulfilment. These are visionary leaders, who if do not exist, should be created by
forces that support democratic development in societies in transition.
Recommendations for the creation and education of such capable visionary leaders
who in turn will mobilize and guide masses to participate in the democratic process,
by promoting the required inspiration for change, are especially valuable to societies
as those in Western Balkans, which has experienced and still experiences periods
of visionary leadership crisis.

The pressure and constant assistance of the international community such as the EU
and the U.S. towards the heads of states and societies of this region have served and
serve this purpose, i.e. the building and cultivation of visionary leaders. Nowadays
most countries should engage in the activities that require efforts to build and cultivate
such leaders. This is necessary to overcome situations created in many fields like
economy, politics etc. by the global crisis of capitalism. This is more imperative in
terms of competition between democratic societies and various forms of hybrid and
undemocratic regimes. The latter convey messages that contain the potential risk of
the distortion of democracy, due to the lack of will and authority that true visionary
leaders should demonstrate. This is at the same time a manifestation of their lack of
accountability. Therefore, as different scholars note, the recommendation to strengthen

_Leadership and its social responsibility_

and cultivate social and political visionary leadership is currently very important.[17]

**Some conclusions**

_Firstly, in our changing democratic societies, the need to cultivate visionary and_
responsible social leadership is present in all fields of life. These needs become
more urgent in terms of capitalism’s crisis, which seems to be long and impedes the
process of democratic changes that are taking place in our societies in the region and
beyond.

_Secondly, our societies are going through the preliminary stages of cultivation of_
strategic leadership, in the stage of leader formation in all areas of social, economic,
political, administrative, business, and science life etc. in order to ensure the
indomitability of democratic process and accelerate the pace of democratic change
in the country’s integration into the European family, the European Union, after the
accession to NATO. This means that it is necessary to increase the social capital in
leadership, to institutionalize the process of rotation in leadership in organizations
and structures that affect the destiny of people in the country. Therefore, the overcome
of the deficit in leadership makes it necessary to build mechanisms that guarantee
free circulation without tension, i.e. the democratic circulation of elites in power, by
guaranteeing the stability of the political and social system and promoting the
cultivation of independent professional elites in all areas of economic, administrative,
scientific, military life etc.

_Thirdly, the development of civilization, the infinite increase of the volume of_
knowledge and expertise, and the democratization of the education process, require
new vision from constructive and rational leadership in a political and social
viewpoint, because political institutions are institutions of a particular type. They
are instruments of system construction, and its component parts at the same time.
They are the main tool, through which a social community can achieve common
goals. Because of their composition, structure and their functioning, of goals they
have and laws they adopt on behalf of the society (in the context of representing
institutions), they have a lasting impact on the character of the society and state, on
the way they will evolve in the future.

_Fourthly, in the balance of power between the visionary leader and masses that follow_
him in a democratic society, there are frequently changes of positions, which again
bring us to the question “should the horses pull the cart, or the cart should push the
horses ahead? Nowadays, when it comes to the fourth wave of global democratization;
a visionary leadership is required, which implies leadership that clearly defines the
role of each of the above two factors in the development of society. Overestimating
the role of leader and putting into question the role of masses that follow him, which
constitute the reservoir of preparing new leaders, can be regarded as a failure of the
definition of leadership mission and manifestation of its absence.

_Public Communication, an important element of the AF activity_


##### Public Communication as an important element of the
 Armed Forces activity

PhD. Jaup Zenuni

Lecturer at the Academy of the Albanian Armed Forces

**Short commentary. In the information age and the rapid technological development,**
_the armed forces as part of NATO structures are facing new challenges that arise_
_from the rapid global developments, NATO New Strategic Concept, from requirements_
_for implementation into practice of the ‘smart defence’ and the peculiarities of our_
_country. In the framework of the Alliance’s New Strategic Concept and its strategic_
_communication, public diplomacy as part of it has undergone significant changes._
_In the opinion of some people it seems as if public diplomacy is not connected with_
_the Armed Forces (AF), because there are other institutions and actors responsible_
_to deal with this important element of international communication. Such an approach_
_is not only outdated but also counterproductive because in the context of the battle_
_to ‘win hearts and minds’, which constitutes one of the pillars of ‘soft power’, the AF_
_today conduct an asymmetric war which requires the contributions of public_
_diplomacy in their activity. In this context, the AF should not be considered a simple_
_mechanism of ‘strong power’ but also as a valuable contributor to our national_
_public diplomacy._

**Keywords: NATO, AF, strategic communication, public diplomacy, ‘soft power’.**

**Introduction**

he end of the Cold War increased expectations for the existence of a permanent
peace in the entire world, but the revival of terrorism with its peak on September
11[th] and the conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan,

# TChad, and recently in Middle East show that the achievement of a lasting peace

across the globe is difficult. They also showed that the end of the Cold War was
accompanied by a change in the nature of threats from symmetric threats to asymmetric
ones.

In her paper “Public Diplomacy: Remedy for NATO’s Image Problem” E. Akçada”
(2012:106) notes that:

“…as a result of a paradigm shift, the merely military issues which were the
_responsibility of AF have been replaced by new security threats that are centred_

70


-----

_PhD. Jaup Zenuni_

_upon the individual and society. One of the main characteristic features of the new_
_security threats is their being international in nature. In other words, these threats_
_neither appear just because of the actions of a certain state nor pose a threat for a_
_single state. Thus, in the world where “insecurity gets globalized”, security issues_
_have gained a significant importance.”[1]_

In a world that changes very quickly and which is built by the revolution in information
and communication, the most effective means to create a positive image, to update
the existing image, to provide prestige and credibility or to convey messages to the
public in other countries is public diplomacy. Hence, the considering public diplomacy
with the appropriate attention in AF as well as the construction of an effective activity
in this direction by partnering with institutions and other stakeholders would be a
salient aspect of the efforts to further integration into NATO structures.

As a NATO member it is necessary for the Albanian Armed Forces (AAF) to know
well the Alliance’s policy of Strategic Communications which in particular highlights
the requirements for an effective public diplomacy. ACO Directive (ad) 95-2, ACO
Strategic Communications presented in April 2012 define strategic communication
of the Alliance as follows:

“…the coordinated and appropriate use of NATO communications activities and
_capabilities-Public Diplomacy, Public Affairs (PA), Military Public Affairs,_
_Information Operations (Info Ops) and Psychological Operations (PSYOPS), as_
_appropriate-in support of Alliance policies, operations and activities, and in order_
_to advance NATO’s aims”.[2]_

This definition indicates that Public Diplomacy ranks as one of the key components
of the Strategic Communication therefore the AF of every member country should
assess this component not only politically, but also from the practical and operational
standpoint. For the AAF which has no heritage in this area, this is not only a novelty
but also a necessity. On the other hand, as part of the Alliance we are an active
participant in peacekeeping operations, joint exercises, training activities or NATO
staffs, we need to give special attention to issues of Strategic Communications in
general and those of Public Diplomacy in particular, in the strategic documents of
the AAF, in the education system and in priority units.
**Strategic approach to Public Diplomacy**

Bruce Gregory, in his paper “Public Diplomacy and Strategic Communication:

Cultures, Firewalls, and Imported Norms” delivered at the Conference organized by
the American Association of Political Science on “International Communication and
Conflict”, besides other points highlight that:

“Strategy is a term that answers the question “how.”7 Interests and values describe
_the goals of strategy and answer the question “why.” A strategy is a plan for action_

_Public Communication, an important element of the AF activity_

_that sets priorities and uses resources to achieve goals. Strategic logic in any endeavour_
_involves determination of specific ends and choices among instruments needed to_
_achieve them. Public diplomacy is one of the important instruments among a variety_
_of persuasive, cooperative, and coercive instruments available to strategists.”[3]_

But what is Public Diplomacy and why it is an effective instrument in the fight to
win ‘hearts and minds’? The term Public Diplomacy was used for the first time by
the former U.S. diplomat Edmund Gullion in 1965, who at the time was the dean of
the Fletcher School of Diplomacy, Tuft University. According to Gullion Public
Diplomacy “…deals with the influence of public attitudes on the formation and
_execution of foreign policies. It encompasses dimensions of international relations_
_beyond traditional diplomacy”.[4] Public diplomacy at its core is negotiation. If, before_
the Cold War it was a means in East-West conflict as opposed to heavy machinery of
communist propaganda against Western values, modern public diplomacy has changed
the ways of conducting negotiations. Today it serves a dual purpose: it is used as a
negotiating tool and as an instrument for the development of unconventional war,
i.e. part of ‘soft power’.

Referring to the following scheme, built by Allied Command Transformation (2012),
Public diplomacy is a political level tool along with Public Affairs. The first communicating
with foreign audiences and the second communicating with audiences inside the country.
According to the Allied Command Operations Directive on Public Affairs (2008) “Public

_support for NATO’s missions and tasks follows from public understanding of how the_
_Alliance makes a difference to international peace and security”[5]_

A diagram depicting the relationship between various components of NATO’s
strategic communications efforts.[6]

As it can easily be noted, both political and military instruments, are part of the
same scheme that constitutes the essence of the content of NATO Strategic
Communication. These elements are complementary and interact with each other in
compliance with Alliance’s strategy. The fact that public diplomacy as an instrument
is included in the political level does not imply that it will be used by NATO political
leaders or leaders of member states only. Every member of the Armed Forces, first
of all should understand the essence of NATO policy for strategic communication,
intentions and practical ways to use these communication instruments.

This necessity arises first and foremost from the Alliance’s major interests which
should address the audiences with a unified message. It also arises from our narrow
national interests and yet from the interests of the AF. According to Akçada”
(2012:108):

_“In a globalized world, public opinion matters more than ever. Yet, because of_
_communication and information revolutions, publics have become more distrustful_
_of the governments and the international organizations. That is why the ability to_
_influence public opinions (in other words, public diplomacy), has become one of the_
_most crucial elements of foreign policy. This feature of public diplomacy can be_
_found in Huns Tuch’ definition: “…a government’s process of communicating with_
_foreign publics in an attempt to bring about understanding for its nation’s ideas and_
_ideals, its institutions and culture, as well as its national goals and current policies.”[7]_

Unlike traditional diplomacy which conducts this kind of communication through
elites engaged in diplomatic service and top state leaders, public diplomacy
accomplishes it through experts of various fields such as officers, engineers, artists,
actors, sportsmen, retired diplomats etc., who are engaged in public diplomacy through
missions, projects, business exchanges, training, cultural, artistic and sports activities;
through non-governmental organizations; through various printed or audio-visual
media.

From this perspective the question arises: What kind of contribution can the AF give
in the field of public diplomacy?
**Public Diplomacy as a novelty and necessity for the AAF**

The request for inclusion of the Armed Forces in the activities of public diplomacy
is a novelty in terms of our country because it is a more or less fresh ground and for

_Public Communication, an important element of the AF activity_

historical reasons we inherited lack of experience in this area. Activities such as the
various campaigns about the necessity of NATO membership in the press, especially
in the military press and in audio-visual media, joint training activities and exercises
with bilateral or multilateral context, the intense political activity of state leaders
and key institutions to convince the public at home and abroad on the determination
of the Albania to be part of the Alliance, various publications on the role and
importance of NATO and other activities, in character, have been contributions to
public diplomacy.

However, we have reached a new stage. From April 2009, Albania is a full NATO
member. This change in status has a great significance for the AAF. Politically, we
are part of an alliance which as stated by the former U.S. Secretary of State Madeline
Albright is “…an Alliance of democracies which is the basis of the Alliance itself,
_which obviously means that our publics need to understand what this is all about in_
_the 21st century.”[8] From this point of view NATO’s public diplomacy rests on two_
pillars: first, on the work to convince and clarify the public of its member countries
on the role and importance of the Alliance for peace and security not only for the
member states and; for a stable democratic order in the Euro-Atlantic space; secondly,
working with foreign audiences to display NATO’s values and contributions to peace
and security. The second pillar is closely related to the first one because without trust
and the blessing of the public within the borders of the Alliance public diplomacy
outside this space may not be successful.

In the battle to win ‘minds and hearts’ and as part of the Alliance AAF can increase
its contributions in public diplomacy. To do this it is important:

First, to understand NATO’s policy about public diplomacy. Reconsidering the
importance of working with its image NATO has started to conduct a more effective
public diplomacy based on new Strategic Communication that derives from the new
Strategic Concept. Alliance has now a certain institution that deals with the policy
and management of public diplomacy. All this activity is based on a particular strategy
which in turn is built on six principles set out very clearly by Stefanie Babst, Deputy
/Assistant Secretary General for Public Diplomacy (2009:4-7) in her remarks at
“NATO PfP Symposium”.

**Public diplomacy is about listening. According to Babst “... Listening is important**
for two reasons: _firstly, collecting and analyzing the opinions of your respective_
target groups or segments of the public is a MUST. Unfortunately, not many
governments and organizations systematically invest in surveying public trends. If at
all, they often prefer to rely on snapshots offering little in-depth knowledge of the
sort that could help them understand their target groups and shape their public
diplomacy approach accordingly; secondly, however, the listening must be genuine.
It must be a serious effort to understand the motives and beliefs of your interlocutors.[9]

**Public diplomacy must be connected to policy. This is a crucial issue because**
there is no substitute for a sound policy. There is no successful public diplomacy
without a balanced and transparent policy. Babst stresses that: “What counts is not
_what you say, but what you do. That is why public diplomacy cannot and should not_
_attempt to portray a serious crisis or war in rosy colours. You can never communicate_
_a problem away. You may try, but experience tells us that most attempts are bound to_
_fail.”[10] Examples of failure in Iraq and Afghanistan show that haste in politics and_
declaring victory prematurely brought damage which required investments of energy,
large forces and resources later. Referring to these examples Babst asks: “What does
_this tell us about an effective public diplomacy effort? In the first place, it tells us_
_how imperative it is to be clear about your political goal. Often it is better for a_
_government to admit that it is still trying to find the best solution, and that making_
_progress takes time. Secondly, it tells us that communication efforts-no matter how_
_skillfully designed-are likely to fail if you insist on portraying something as a success_
_story if it is not-as in the case of Afghanistan.”[11]_

**Public diplomacy must be credible to be effective. Babst elaborates this principle**
stating that: “ What applies to dealings with the media should apply to all public
_partners: if you try to manipulate or lie, you will immediately lose credibility._
_Unfortunately, there are numerous examples of how much damage a dishonest public_
_diplomacy effort can do to a government or even an entire country. In times of crisis_
_or war it may seem particularly tempting to turn the truth upside down or at least_
_twist it as much as possible. But despite the overflow of information in today’s round-_
_the-clock media environment, the public’s memory still works and deception and lies_
_are not easily forgiven.”[12] Nowadays you cannot keep things unrevealed due to_
communication technologies and open societies globally. You are permanently under
the eyes and scope of social media and civil society has become a very important
player in molding public opinion and attitudes.

**Public Diplomacy is not always about you. This principle relates to the role of key**
leaders, the mentality and the sense that they should have to contribute to public
diplomacy. According to Babst: “Sometimes the most effective public diplomacy will
_be conducted under the media spotlights, but at other times, policy issues are better_
_communicated by third parties, such as think tanks and academics, than through_
_official statements. Facilitating and supporting discussions among political networks_
_or groups of foreign policy professionals can be an excellent public diplomacy strategy_
_if the aim is to introduce and bring to the public attention a specific policy issue.”[13]_
The core of this principle is that nowadays a better cooperation with experts of
different fields and the construction of an environment where responsibilities are
shared for the mutual interest, remains as one of the cornerstones for the success of
public diplomacy. From this point of view, there is an indispensable need for AF to
get rid of some of traditional mentalities that military issues, even at political level
are a domain simply belonging to military people.

_Public Communication, an important element of the AF activity_

**Public Diplomacy needs to respond to the challenges of the 2.0 web world. To be**
effective public diplomacy must use the entire arsenal of communication tools ranging
from face-to-face communication to participation in online social networks. This is
a challenge imposed by the information society and global trend.

**Public diplomacy requires proper planning, training and resources. This principle**
requires a new mentality. This is because, according to Babst, “... _for a long time_
_public diplomacy was not seen as a core business, and public diplomacy experts had_
_to sit at the end of the production line, far from the centre where policy is made and_
_implemented. That needs to change._ _Public diplomacy must become an integral part_
_of national policy planning and, ultimately, decision-making. Understanding public_
_diplomacy as a serious political instrument also means providing the necessary_
_financial resources. As designing and executing a public diplomacy campaign does_
_not come for free, governments need to mobilize the necessary funds to get public_
_diplomacy rolling.”[14]_

These principles and all the strategy and policy of NATO’s Strategic Communication
should be well understood by all levels of the chain of command in the Armed Forces.
This is necessary in order to achieve what experts call the ‘unification of the message
within the Alliance’. In this context all commands of forces and units have their own
responsibilities, in particular the Academy of the Armed Forces, especially the
Department of Strategy. In different courses, ranging from Senior Course for Security
and Defence and to the basic course, according to the course level, topics which
clarify the concept of strategic communication and public diplomacy might be part
of training programs. The High Course for Security and Defense might have as part
of its program a module entitled “Strategic Communication” which includes public
diplomacy, public affairs, military public affairs, information operations,
psychological operations and cyber war. Nowadays AAF has sufficient human and
material resources to organize conferences, seminars and debates on public diplomacy
by inviting experts from institutions outside the armed forces. OMLT courses or
other pre-deployment courses need to include some basic knowledge on general
strategic communication and public diplomacy in particular. These courses should
cover some more practical guidelines on how to increase our forces contribution to
missions in the framework of the Alliance.

Second, our Armed Forces have established a good reputation while participating in
NATO peacekeeping operations. Ministry of Defence and the General Staff have
reflected the activity of our forces in their web pages to make it known to the public.
Articles and stories in the press, and not only, have written about the contribution of
our armed forces in missions abroad. However, there is still much room for a better
reflection of this image. As a contribution in the context of public diplomacy in the
Armed Forces could be publications in magazines of NATO member countries or
articles written by officers of various ranks, reports from deployments places our
forces in missions, military portraits who stand for professionalism and high integrity
in missions. Our military attachés can play the role of a catalyst and coordinator for
this purpose. Nowadays there are several well-educated and visionary military people

in our armed forces who have a good command of NATO languages  so they should
participate in discussions and various blogs organized by the major social networks
on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube and Flicker. AAF also has the right capacities
to be active in NATO’s television NATOChannel.tv, in NATO official website and
the new interactive Web platform WE-NATO. By addressing this issue in her article
“Redesigning the NATO Public Diplomacy, Stephanie Babst (2008:5) writes:

“Delivering NATO’s messages about its policies and operations via web-based videos
_and other audio-visual and new media tools will be key to reaching out to younger_
_demographic groups. It would be equally important to communicate with the under-_
_40 generation via web 2.0. technologies, for example through blogs and chat rooms._
_In order to do so effectively, NATO must come rapidly up to speed in understanding_
_the communications technologies of the 21st century – and then decide how best to_
_turn the new tools to its advantage.”[15]_

Concerting the preparatory work of our troops for missions or joint exercises, in
terms of public diplomacy, with those of other allied countries is also of great
importance. This requires that prior to deploying our troops the commands must be
familiar with public diplomacy priorities, i.e. in ISAF mission in order that public
diplomacy topics planned for these troops should be harmonized with the specific
conditions of Afghanistan and ISAF priorities. Every soldier and officer who goes
on a mission in a given country is seen by the population of that country, first as a
representative of the Alliance, and secondly, as a representative of our country. In
this regard through his attitudes, behaviours and communication he creates the
reputation for the Alliance and the country. This is one of the reasons that participation
in missions abroad should be considered as a great responsibility.

There are a number of Albanian officers that nowadays work at various NATO staffs
or are being trained in different training centres abroad. Along with their role in the
military headquarters, they are points of contact with the public of the countries
where they work or are being trained. Thus, they can and must contribute through
publications, participation in discussions in social networks or on various NATO
blogs. Their contribution would be welcome in the area of installation of cooperation
between our forces commands with the commands of allied forces in the field of
public diplomacy.

Finally, increasing the effectiveness of public diplomacy in the AF raises the need
for better cooperation with many other actors such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, Ministry of Education, State Police, NonGovernmental Organizations, NATO country embassies accredited in our country,
with various printed and audio-visual media, especially national ones, and why not
with prestigious media such as CNN, BBC, Reuters, CBS, etc.. as well as with all the
experts of different areas of life that can make contributions to enhance the
effectiveness of public diplomacy of the Armed Forces.

_Public Communication, an important element of the AF activity_

**Conclusions**

In the context of the work to apply New NATO Strategic Concept in the daily activity,
an important aspect in the activity of the Armed Forces is to know well Alliance’s
policies for Strategic Communication in general and public diplomacy in particular.
The conditions of our country, which had no legacy in the field of public diplomacy,
such a thing is not only a novice but also a necessity arising from the dynamics of
further integration into NATO. Although in terms of the global crisis financial
constraints do not allow giving the required priority to public diplomacy in the activity
of AF, there are possibilities to give new pace to it by using the existing resources.

It is the right time to include the AF in public diplomacy activities. This is not a
subjective desire. It should become an important component in the entire chain of
command of the AF.

Above all we should create the belief that within the frame of the asymmetrical war
at the beginning of the 21st century, in the battle to ‘win minds and hearts’; public
diplomacy is one of the most effective instruments.

Hence, first it is necessary to intensify activities that would clarify NATO requirements
for effective public diplomacy. This requires that all commands and force staffs,
especially the Armed Forces Academy create the necessary environment for public
diplomacy activities and review the curricula to include Strategic Communication
and Public Diplomacy in different training modules. Another requirement is the
reflection of NATO standards for Strategic Communications in the strategy documents
of the Armed Forces; organization of activities like conferences, seminars, debates
and discussions about public diplomacy; a better co-ordination of work with all other
relevant stakeholders that are interested in an effective public diplomacy. This would
help us as a NATO member while addressing foreign audiences be in the same
‘wavelength’ with the Alliance’s messages.

Second, the human resources within the AF should be better guided for the benefit of
public diplomacy by contributing to the reputation of the AF and the country in
general by publications in printed or audio-visual media abroad, especially in NATO
member countries -s; by their personal example as professionals and people of
integrity; by active participation in social networks used by NATO and; by being
more present in the official Web site of NATO and its TV channel.

Finally, public diplomacy should be considered as a weapon to win the battle without
taking lives but winning the hearts of people. Today, in the era of the information
society, this weapon can be used effectively if we know its secrets and importance.

_AAF Challenges - Full integration in NATO_


##### AAF Challenges - Full integration in the NATO’s
 security system and collective defence


LtC.(R) MSc. Kanan Himaj

Researcher at National Centre

for Security and Defence

**Short commentary.** _The globalization of security threats has transformed the nature_
_and scope of NATO’s operations and missions involved in combat, peace preservation,_
_education and training, logistical support and humanitarian operations, etc._

_The country’s integration in the Euro-Atlantic zone is not only a national priority,_
_but more than that, a great opportunity for development and prosperity, security and_
_peace. The process of Albania’s accession to NATO has produced a change of the_
_entire political environment, constitutional, administrative and infrastructure of the_
_country. Participation in larger organizations has contributed, among others, to_
_create the image of our country as a stabilizing factor in the region and a security_
_source. Integration into other structures and coalitions within the regional and global_
_efforts to intensify economic and social development is the right way for our country_
_to achieve prosperity and sustainable security within the wider international security_
_system. Already, the coexistence of prosperity aspirations, integration and security_
_are mandatory, because we cannot talk about progress and social welfare without_
_individual and collective security[1]._

_All countries and nations remain subjects of international law, but, considering the_
_complexity of the world around us, it is difficult for each country to provide adequate_
_answers to all the problems that they face today. This is why there are associated_
_problems in the long term, in order to solve common issues. This is why safety and_
_security are a well-defined area._

1 Collective security can be understood as a security arrangement, regional or global, in which each
country agrees that the security system is one concern of everyone and therefore committed to a collective
response to threats to peace and touch. Collective security is more ambitious than the security systems
or collective defence alliance, which seeks to include the entirety of a region or country within the
global and handle a wide range of potential threats. While collective security is an idea with a long
history, its implementation in practice has proved problematic.

**The Relationship between national and collective defence**

e live in an era with a future hard to predict. People, nations, states,
international organizations cannot be untouched by several armed conflicts,
whether not such, if they have a low intensity or they are frozen.

# W

National defence is one of the most important state functions. This results from the
dynamics of defence, as a complex social phenomenon, with its determinations to
manage it. National defence functions are represented by political, military, economic
measures adopted by a state, in order to protect its independence, sovereignty and
territorial integrity. Endangering these aspirations shows the inability of the state;
which suffers from a lack of promotion of national interests.

The Armed Forces are at the core of our national security. They make a unique and
vital contribution; above all, they provide the use of force when the country needs
protecting vital national interests.

Even today, in the era of globalization, our national defence will continue to have
two essential aspects: Individual defense against aggressions from other political
states; inclusion in coalitions with other states (especially Western countries and
NATO) to achieve the proposed objectives, i.e. collective defence.

As above, the sizes of national defence are not sectarian and unchanging. On the
contrary, they become more flexible, transparent and convincing due to increased
complexity and hostility of the security environment in the region and beyond.

This happens when the national dimension of internationalization imposes its defence,
collective movement, in formats expressed by the formula of alliances, coalitions,
partnerships, etc.

Our visions for national defence, as opposed to the collective are: national defence is
considered and evaluated as an inalienable attribute of the State; national Defence is
considered as a support, generation of collective defence, as the meaning and reason
of common or collective defence, which are related to ensuring the inviolability of
borders, security and defence, with joint participation; collective defense is
complementary to national defence, as we face a risk assumed or required, imposed,
given the emergence of global risks and threats; collective defence[2] is a product of
globalization, as globalization of risks, threats and vulnerabilities require globalization
to protect the state and the international community against them.

Current legislation for national and collective defence in accordance with the
framework of protecting the dimensions and implications that arise in the common
way of our allies. The Albanian Constitution defines the role of the Armed Forces,
providing the legal framework for national and collective defence, Article 12 states:

1. The organization of national defence Armed Forces ensure the independence
of the country and protect its territorial integrity and constitutional order.

2 Collective defence is an agreement, usually formatizohet by a treaty and an organization among
participating states commit support in defence of a member state, if it is attacked by another country
outside the organization. NATO is known organization and collective defence.

81


-----

_AAF Challenges - Full integration in NATO_

2. Armed Forces maintain neutrality in political matters and subject to civilian
control.

3. No foreign military force cannot be established, or pass on Albanian territory,
and no military forces could be sent out, except by a law adopted by a majority
of all members of Parliament.

The organization of national defense is an attribute of state and cannot be considered outside the collective defence. As a member of NATO, we have obligations to
allies and those who impose this obligation towards us.

In all major documents is understandable that reading them in the general context
shows that collective defence does not replace national defence will not reduce the
requirements, duties and responsibilities of the state, otherwise they grow and expand
to a larger dimension international, surpassing national.

The UN Charter supports and encourages the right of individual or collective selfdefence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations. The
experience of major international treaties on defence provisions imposed as a form of
collective defence complex, very different, adapted to the concrete historical realities.
Summarizing, its essence can be defined as “...a formalized agreement, usually by a
treaty and an organization among participating states commit support in defence of a
member state, if it is attacked by another country outside the organization”.

There is a correlation between national defence and collective defence, as they condition
each-other. The purpose and objective of national defence can be achieved efficiently
within the collective defence. National defence can be a part of collective defence,
when all its objectives can be found in collective defence, as when we talk about the
moments before launching an aggression, to design the main forces of the Alliance
(coalition) in conflict zones, to start the war. This is why national defence within an
alliance (coalition) is designed and integrated plan based on the principles established
in the normative documents, agreed by the countries participating in the coalition.

Now our experience as a member of NATO has shown complete willingness to
overcome the challenges of defense and the commitment of our state structures,
particularly the Armed Forces of capacity building for collective defence. The fiveyear-old period as NATO members has shown progress and problems in reforming
the defence planning issues in the planning of NATO. At the core of the defense
objectives has been the set of force objectives, not only as an obligation of the Armed
Forces, but also the request of other departments and agencies of the state with special
focus on stabilization operations-post-conflict reconstruction.

The already known path traversed by our country as an ally in the most important
organization for regional and global security which has issued records obligations and
requirements in terms of defense and evaluation system integrated within NATO.

An important requirement of the document of Strategic Defence Review is the
implementation of the Operational Capabilities Concept of NATO. Its application
enables increased capabilities of the Armed Forces and structures related to the
ongoing development of operational capacity, based on standards and best practices

provided by the member countries of the coalition, especially in the wide spectrum
of NATO’s experience.

Also, the Operational Requirements has made it possible to ascertain the elements
of reform procedures for protecting key areas of education, personnel, logistics,
training, assessments, etc. Their application has increased our experience in terms
of information and analysis. So the result is close to reality enabling the unification
of procedures for capacity development in all types of structures.

At the current stage is examined carefully the building of a functional and efficient
organizational structure. The application of the defence review is the transformation
of organizational structures with a view to adapting and adopting structures depending
on the continuous evolution of the strategic concept of NATO and in accordance
with the changing security environment.

As a benefit of implementing a functional organizational structure can be considered
eliminating unnecessary units, to improve the chain of Command and Control, etc.
Its application is necessity stems from the need to apply high standards oriented,
comparable to the best standards applied by NATO countries.
**The missions of Armed Forces in collective defence**

Collective protection is a coordinated response to a common security problem from
two or more locations. The essence of collective defence policy: a commitment from
various nations to assist each other if attacked.

The basic principles of safety and security of our country and the credibility of the
system is involved in the collective defence of NATO. They are based on a strong
relationship and cooperation with partner countries. Membership in NATO and EU
membership ambition of bringing the advantages of collective defence and security,
on the other hand require the implementation of commitments and contributions to
our country.

Growing ambitions of global and regional actors have a fundamental impact on the
balance of the security environment of our country. The Strategic Concept of NATO
from November 2010 defines its role in an environment where the main threats to the
Euro-Atlantic have originated beyond its borders and are not simply of a military nature.
Emphasis is placed in a special way in building the skills that can look at the whole area
of crisis prevention and conflict in achieving stability in post - contradictory situations.

In the dimension of the collective defence of our country there are some important
areas that require more development to the role and mission of actors operating on
security and defence of the country, such as: Active involvement in the collective
defence of NATO based on a strong transatlantic link which is vital to the defence of
the country. Albania supports measures defined in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty
and the development of skills Alliance; our understanding of the concept of NATO’s
operation depends on a sufficient contribution as one of its members. Therefore, in
accordance with Article 3 of the Treaty of Washington, develops its capacity to
ensure the defense of its territory, including the system of collective defence of
NATO. Solidarity between allies and reliability in respect of commitments is crucial
to the ability of NATO to meet its commitments

_AAF Challenges - Full integration in NATO_

Our country participates, on a permanent basis low, Integrated Air Defence NATO
system (NATINADS), which is one of the fundamental pillars of air defence. It
contributes to the collective defence of NATO through its inclusion in the system, in
particular through tactical and operational strength. This enterprise has shown that
the FA have taken an active role in promoting the value of the Alliance, as part of
joint and multinational operations more difficult as Afghanistan, led by NATO,
America or other coalitions such as the war in Iraq. This value is increased as politicalmilitary decision-making, which has continuously depth analysis of real skills over
the years, have come to the conclusion that the Albanian army can participate at the
same time ensuring the protection of the national territory and fulfillment of
commitments to NATO, EU, regional organizations and other coalitions.

We have created the conditions for participation in NATO, EU and UN missions, to
address the full range of crises-before, during and after conflicts. In the process of
implementation of the commitments, it maintains a comprehensive approach to crisis
management operations. One such example is the involvement of the international
community in Afghanistan.

In crisis management activities of international organizations, the Republic Albania
contributes to the training and development of defence and security forces in crisis
areas, in particular by providing military and civilian experts to help local authorities
and assist in reforming the security sector defense. Currently, AAF participate in
NATO’s ISAF mission in Afghanistan as Herat in some regions (the Italian contingent),
Kabul (the Turkish contingent), Kandahar (on special missions with the U.S.
contingent, etc.). Armed Forces participation in peacekeeping missions and combat
mission stems from Constitutional and Legal Basis Armed Forces set for each
contribution to peacekeeping or combat missions.

Within NATO, the Republic of Albania supports building partnerships with relevant
countries and other international organizations, as well as adheres to the term opendoor policy, the policy of membership for all European democratic states in meeting
NATO standards.

We actively support the fight against all forms of terrorism, including the negotiation
and implementation of treaties of anti-terrorist, to help support the fight against terrorism,
sharing intelligence information and the development of response capabilities by
expanding consultations with partners in NATO and partner countries. Since Albania’s
formal membership in NATO has begun to implement the integration plan, which means
deep reform of the security sector with the aim of protecting the full interoperability
with NATO. Part of this plan is the objective force packages, which were taken over by
the AAF as operational capabilities available to NATO for current and future missions.
Their essence is “the battalion group” which represents a “Task Force”. At its core is a
battalion of light infantry, motorized, backed by smaller units (company or platoon
level) for reconnaissance, fire support, air cover, military police service etc.

The fact that Albania is a NATO member offers not only guarantee the security and
stability of the state, but also new responsibilities arising from it. Protecting the
country benefits from a support Euro-Atlantic and reaches the level that defines
collective defence.

So our country’s participation effectively in NATO and EU missions abroad,
performing the functions and attributes of national defence significantly expand the
global space crisis and conflict management skills and capabilities shows collective
defence . To participate in crisis management and conflict, to fight terrorism obviously
means taking part in the prevention of war, conflict check to ensure regional and
global stability. All these indicators show that safety and environmental protection,
economic development and social progress, increased prosperity and consolidate
democracy efficiency factors for national defence. Under these circumstances, there is
no other national defence and collective commitment out international responsibilities.

Given the new Strategic Concept of the Alliance, dominated by efforts to find effective
solutions to eradicate threats to the Euro-Atlantic community and other states are
compulsory liability and with broad international field. Our country has long
understood this right and responsibility, by moving towards the concept of joint
work with a clear and clever enabled the throne stand right coalition of progressive
and largest alliance in the world, NATO ‘s[3].

One of the most important missions of defence, as each national army, is represented
by a confrontation of armed aggression. This has always been the fundamental mission
of the Armed Forces. This means that when it comes to national defence, Albania
will have the full support of the Alliance. This perspective has implications: the
benefits of national defence of collective defence and the prospect of joining the
national and collective defence is a strong feature persuasive and compelling as any
military action against Albania is considered as an attack against the Alliance.

Of course, such a reality discourages potential aggressors, but also terrorist
organizations, targeting all countries that are members of the North- Atlantic Alliance
and the European Union are members. As a real issue, it is connected with missions
that can be performed: rejection of an armed aggression on the national territory. In
that aggression becomes surprise, the defence of the country operates on its own, in
order to stop the attack preserver and then take part in group allied to reject and
destroy the opponent; the second method refers to the participation of Albania, in a
territory of a member state of NATO or the EU, to face an armed aggression against
the State, group of States or EU alliance.

In both situations, modes of action, intervention procedures, rules of engagement are
established strictly within the Alliance and CSDP and permanently updated[4].

**3 NATO Strategic Concept.** In order to guarantee the security of the territory and population of the
NATO countries, the Alliance will continue to meet the high efficient audits show its basic tasks,
always in accordance with international law. Collective defence of NATO members will always assist
each other against attack, in accordance with Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. This commitment
remains immutable and binding.
**4 Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), formerly known as the European Security and Defence**
Policy (ESDP), is a major element of the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European
Union (EU) and is the responsibility of the EU policy the covering defence and military aspects, and
civilian crisis management. ESDP was the successor of the European Security and Defence Identity
under NATO, but differs in that it comes under the jurisdiction of the European Union itself, including
countries that are not members of NATO . Formally, Common Security and Defence Policy is the

Also, strategic planning and the whole system of military training are in line with
NATO standards and is rigorously collective needs and national defence. Another
set of missions are those related to collective defence and refer to the fulfilment of
the commitments associated with NATO, EU, regional organizations and other
international coalitions or created. These missions emanating from an objective
necessity and are the most effective way to build, manage and stabilize the security
environment, able to prevent war and armed conflict and to keep under control
situations of crisis and tension. Therefore, collective defence, and strictly in key
documents are located in NATO and the EU, as the centre of gravity of collective
security and common security. This process included strategies aimed at coping with
difficult situations that generate crises and conflicts.

This is why our army takes part in the whole spectrum of missions within NATO, EU
and OKB: participation in collective defence within NATO and/or EU area and for
each member of the Alliance, under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, as this is the
traditional meaning of the concept.

Participation in defence against terrorism, as they imply that counter-terrorism
measures, protection of civil and military systems, states, infrastructures, institutions
and persons against any terrorist attack and action to combat terrorist networks and
to eliminate the causes generating processes;

As new risks and security threats, national and international, which have been the
most visible missions are built in accordance with the process of transformation of
the Alliance Policy and European Security and Defence.

This is why our military has created the capacity to respond as NATO force: capacity
to act as a force for: non-military actions to help in emergencies and evacuations;

Ability to act as a force faces initial situation, until the arrival of the main forces of

According to the commitments in the Strategic Defence Review Document[5], Albania

Also, to participate in responding to non-Article 5 Crisis (NA5CRO), on the basis of
the concept of “a single grouping of forces” to NATO / EU / UN / or possible coalitions,
beyond national borders and allied to three companies simultaneously in operation.
Within our country’s ambition to cope with civil emergencies (EC), is the support of
an emergency at the Reinforced Battalion (Battalion Task Force), or two simultaneous
emergencies at Reinforced Company (Company Task Force).

With a wide range and with a proper international cooperation, AF participate and
continue to participate in coalition operations inside the stabilization of disturbed
areas and tense, in order to fight terrorism and to fulfil missions specific reestablishment and consolidation of peace.

Our experience in multinational operations has shown a large range of missions can
accomplish. Efforts on the battlefield forces, disarmament, weapons collection,
ammunition and explosives, participation in security operations for the defense and
freedom of movement of political decision makers, international authorities, protecting
people against insurgent attacks, providing defense and support economic policy
objectives in conflict states, all these are some of the activities that we can perform
alone or as part of coalitions .

Even the coalition forces and Albania offers its services, responsibilities. If we
increasingly deal with a very wide range of missions that are close to the national
defence and increased reliability to the collective NATO, UN, EU and other coalitions
to fulfil their role to ensure stability and European security and defence in the EuroAtlantic area location in our country .

**In conclusion, national defence and collective defence-as real and major conceptual**
record two historical epochs, referring achievement and consolidation of states in
terms of globalization, states are interdependent - are complementary and fully
justified in fulfilling their obligations towards each other. Therefore, the spectrum of
missions must meet to become larger, more modern and constantly adapt to political
decisions on the right, on time by the state. Result of this process is the transformation
of the military in order to ensure the reliability of national defence, the fulfilment of
commitments under collective defence and participation in international missions,
in accordance with the priorities and policy requirements related to the defense of
Albania.

The level of ambition of Albania in NATO is the balance between obligations and
non-military contributions within the Alliance military, political goals and ambitions
for our country presence and capacity available, to realize these ambitions. It is
particularly important to ensure the maintenance of the balance between declarations
policies for determining the level of national scope available to the Alliance forces
and support them with the necessary financial resources for the human being as an
efficient solution to the equation with two unknown liabilities and benefits.

Besides other things, it developed an elite military and civilian defence professionals,
who are able to participate, compete, represent and negotiate with all counterparts of
other countries and organizations allied NATO. This requires increasing the reliability
of state bodies to ensure not only the preservation of this group of intellectuals but

##### Discretion and Deontology of National Intelligence Agencies

LtC MSc. Sokrat Paskali

Chief of Intelligence Training Centre of AIM

_“When the government activities are studied, we must use idealistic manner”_

_Max Weber_

**Short commentary.** _Based on my academic knowledge and experience in intelligence_
_agencies, I have been attracted from the idea that if we can remove all things that_
_our class and niftiness would see as unnecessary, related to most fundamental,_
_important and current then what would remain for the states intelligence as it is_
_itself? According to my point of view it is intelligence discretion and deontology in_
_relation discretion versus deontology even though they can be considered and used_
_in a bipolar form. On the other hand states’ intelligence discretion has its exclusivity_
_and no one has it, while its deontology is the need of public interests and no other_
_interest._

_The intention of this paper which is a part of a longer one is to create a new module_
_of Advanced Course of Intelligence Officer. The main theses are written with the_
_intention of having new referential dimensions in this field and considering as a new_
_source that complete an old vacuum for this item._

**States’ Discretion and Deontology**

tates’ reason” was born from community relationships and it is accepted as
necessity of human relations even though frequently it has been subject of
discussions and contests in the direct applications; especially in human rights

# Sdomain but, and for its efficiencies and effectively in problem solving. Sometimes in

an exaggerated way these words are used as “saint” words. Now “states’ reason” is
wanted to be considered as “reasonable state”, which knows its capabilities and
“scruples” to do the things that should be done for the public interest; and knows its
limits in efficiency and affectivity context. “States’ scruples” are related with states’
discretion, using as good as possible of foreign and home functions. “States’ limits”
are related with the necessity to be efficient and effective as more as possible.

89


-----

_Discretion and Deontology of National Intelligence Agencies_

Discretion of states’ activity is legitimating of government, but not only the perimeter
and deepness of allowed things, but even the borders and walls that should serve as
an obstacle not to enter where it is forbidden, which is another thing, which the state
has the necessary clarity not to aspirate.

Deontology of states’ activity is the quality of public application through problem
solving for which individuals pay the taxes and request “fair” services. The necessity
for the state includes the basis of its deontology. It is the necessity to be served and
to realize problem solving without attack to privacy and those things which people
do not want to be part of public environment. This is the deontology of states’ activity.

States’ significance is not anymore the states’ reason of Cardinal Richelieu, but
reasonable state that knows very well and applies its scruples and limits in the right
way. States’ significance is necessity for a qualitative and “fair” public administration
of home and foreign government functions for the individuals that are administered
altogether and discretion is the way of applying this administration remaining in the
public sphere. The request is not to pass to the other domain, human rights, which
are a wide and complicated to be understood and then to keep in mind in practice.

Significance of intelligences’ discretion and deontology is included in the word
“statecraft”, when the craft of states job have to summarize and accomplish two
things: first thing is the government necessity for public administration and the second
thing is quantity and quality of application of foreign and home functions.
**States’ intelligence discretion and deontology**

Intelligence Agencies are states’ organizations and institutions as others are. The
point of view for transformation from “states’ reason” to “reasonable state” is valid
for them too. To be reasonable the focus, spectrum and deepness of “problem solving”
application need to be clear.

What is the intelligence agency discretion? It is its exclusivities, activities and issues
which belong only to it and no other government institutions. The exclusivities are
subject matter of intelligence production for the threats which are posed to the states’
security. For instance problem solving of espionage and CI is domain of subject
matter agency. In this way counterterrorism problems even though the first (espionage
and CI) is a symmetric problem, where states’ intelligence agencies are adversaries,
meanwhile the second (terrorism) is an asymmetric problem where the threats do not
come only from specific states but even from organizations, groups and individuals.
The important difference is the fact that espionage exclusivity (foreign intelligence
and CI) is absolute, while in the case of terrorism (counterterrorism) the exclusivity
exist but it is relative, because the terrorism is a threat where participate even law
enforcement institutions. The most important thing is work dissemination, where
should be identified the meaning of discretion: the work of intelligence agency, the
work of law enforcement institutions and collaborating work. But there is another
domain, human rights domain which should be defended by the governments’
interference.

Today intelligence agencies face with two immediate risks:

a. Overlap with law enforcement institutions

90


-----

_LtC MSc. Sokrat Paskali_

b. Exit from their discretion and being there where do not have exclusive
competencies.

Overlap comes from needs of random administration. Daily problems bring in
evidence “break of rules”, which cannot be avoided in real life dynamics from usage
of systems, processes, cycles of raw information in intelligence collection. If they
are administered as intelligence problems then we will be faced with overlap because
two different institutions of the state work on the same problem that belongs to only
one of them. We have overlapping even when two intelligence agencies take each
other’s exclusivities. For example, according to personal jurisdiction the Defence
Intelligence Agency have in administration threats posed to military personnel and
civilians that are related to defence and in the case when civilian agencies take this
exclusivity we face with overlapping.

If an intelligence agency deals with not exclusive problems then it will be out of its
competencies, because problems of intelligence agencies are “desk” problems where
in an explicit way are counted as procedural treatment. These issues are related to
“statement to define”, “procedure to follow” and “good practice to accomplish”. All
these can be named as “standards of performance”. Standards of performance are
related to subject matter of intelligence production. They are as legacy problems of
intelligence agencies as competence professional problems related to education and
training of intelligence officers.

The intelligence officer concept stands for the intelligence staff member responsible
for the direction, collection, processing and dissemination of the intelligence process.
Standards of performance are decided by intelligence officers “seignior”, who are
leaders of professional structures in the responsibility and interest areas and in the
function directions for the intelligence production.

Setting of standards of performance is related to intelligence officer seignior’s
education and training who has experience and knowledge. The most important
moment for them is their conceptual work in researches and problem solving.
Education and training of intelligence officers in our country is still a supplementary
problem and not a fundamental or basic. Every intelligence seignior should have
professional ideas and believes that should be clear, consistent and to be used for
public interest.

Having seignior people in the intelligence agencies who “know how” is an necessity
that is solved with a modern education and training system, even through a fair
human resources policy based on decision-making commissions and important
managers. The most important thing that prohibits creation and promotion of seignior
levels is lack of traditions, culture problems, and weak sense of selection and negative
factors of the current situation. It is an immediate necessity the work for creation of
an intelligence seignior literature and foundation of faithful instances which are able
to admit, appraise and stimulate them. I suggest restarting a set of intelligence officer
advanced course and some intelligence field researches with a double scope:

a. Fair identification of an intelligence seignior group from the current human
resources.

91


-----

_Discretion and Deontology of National Intelligence Agencies_

b. Foundation of a special intelligence literature from the intelligence seigniors’
abilities.

These intentions and projects that we own and are written in strategies and programs
need to be supported with human capacities and financial support. We already have
capacities but the support is a cultural problem that should be over passed.

When Jurgen Habermas talks for the modern realities he underlines an interesting
division of existence in two worlds: “World of System” and “World of Life”. World
of system is the world which functions from institutional states buildings based on
rules and norms. World of life is the world that functions in real life through, above
and below the rules and norms, where every individual has a specific way with
different situations.

States’ intelligence deontology is all the activity to complete the public interest based
on mentality, traditions, positive regulation and functioning of real life and system
world. In our country except modest traditions of system world our “positive” reality
(constitution, codes, laws, procedures, instances, powers etc) are standards and
analogy taken from other countries mostly from western countries. But they have
roots, stems, branches and leaves in their cultures and this is the biggest problem for
us. It has been always in this way. As cultural “meme” their application for a long
time brings development of the country but in overall the development will be
gradually.

In my point of view states’ intelligence deontology is related with each of the stages
of classic cycle of intelligence production:

(i) The way how is directed the states’ intelligence.
(ii) The way how is collected the information.
(iii) The way how is processed the information and intelligence including and

operational aspect of home and foreign activities.

(iv) The way how intelligence is disseminated to decision-makers with all foreign

and home complications.

(v) The way how feedback and priority intelligence requirements are written

and administered.

**Who are the intelligence seigniors?**

My opinion is the intelligence seignior is obligated to have some distinct features
related to two “V” and one “W”: Virtue-Values-Will. These are needed to harvest the
experience fruits in statecraft and high level of cognitive process as it is written in
Bloom’ taxonomy.

Virtue is the most important element for the seignior intelligence officer because it is
the main gate that guarantees the quality of public service. Being fair and loyal to
public interest is fundamental.
Values that make the difference are: problem solving and researching.
Will is another important aspect in the distinct features of intelligence seignior. The
will to become “gray eminence” and to “sublimate in silence”.

92


-----

_LtC MSc. Sokrat Paskali_

Knowing and stimulating intelligence seigniors in the state agencies and in the other
functions included in this domain is the only way and the best way to build and
function a qualitative statecraft in our country. I agree with an opinion of researchers
that states’ elite in our country suffer from two features which are:

1. Their superficial character.

2. Their instable character.

I think that superficial character comes from the reason of being isolated in a globalised
world related to values. Meanwhile instable character comes from identity dilemma
which determines the elite way of thinking.

Two main parameters which should dominate the seigniors mind are:

-universality
-consistency

I suggest this way to do things that improve this situation:

-  Current seigniors should write their ideas and believes for the context
phenomena and intelligence problem solving in the branches where they are
working. These will be an intelligence seignior literature and foundation of
faithful instances which are able to admit, appraise and stimulate them

-  Foundation of a small structure with 4-5 members as professional staff of
States’ Intelligence Community inside government structures.

**Conclusion**

The most important suggestion in my paper is necessity for the States’ Intelligence
Community as a new institute and instance that would help the modernization of the
intelligence agencies in our country. For this we can do:

1. Preparation of a law “For the States’ Intelligence Community”, where will

be addressed the duties and responsibilities of this instance and ways of
collaboration between intelligence agencies.

2. Functioning of a set of seignior level in every agency and staff of States’

Intelligence Community need to know about “Virtue-Values-Will”-status for
them now and in the future.

3. The above mentioned seigniors thought about intelligence standards of

performance should be important and with access in decision-making for the
intelligence community problems.

4. Intelligence structures should have a distinct hierarchy with five actors in its

activity: (i) Political leaders (customers, requesters and intelligence users)
(ii) Intelligence managers (Director, Vice Director), (iii) Seigniors (Chief of
territorial/ functional structures), (iv) Experts and (v) Specialists. It is
important to rewrite the job descriptions for everyone.

5. To be organized a set of Advanced Intelligence Course in cooperation with

Academic level of the country and with NATO strategic partners.

6. States’ Intelligence Community Staff should invest and help the similar

structures in different agencies and may organize cooperation with them.

_Discretion and Deontology of National Intelligence Agencies_

7. In our country we have two agencies: SHISH and AIM which have different

salaries for the same functions. This is not fair! And the last but not least, in
intelligence literature is a quote: “If you don’t have money you can bay
mediocrity.”

##### Language, a vital factor of national geopolitics


Granit Zela, PhD Programme, 2011-2014

Silvana Markgjonaj, “Master of Sciences”Programme, 2011-2013

Armed Forces Academy

**Short commentary.** _Language is one of the fundamental components of the people’s_
_identity and ethnicities. It is one of their distinctive characteristics and henceforth it_
_may be the main feature of establishing their identity. When it comes to language, we_
_are considering a geopolitical dimension of internal states. Language can also be_
_an external dimension of geopolitics, being a factor of power and influence on nations,_
_by transforming likewise into a factor of hegemony._

_A nation that loses its language loses not only the soul but also its distinction as_
_people. But what is the way leading from ethnicity to the nation and the nation state?_
_It is a long way that passes through a common language for the population living_
_within the state borders. Thus, language is also a means of building national projects._

**Language as a national power instrument**

hen they asked Chancellor Otto von Bismarck about the most significant
event in history, he answered enigmatically: “North America speaks
English”. The message conveyed by the greatest mind of the European

# Wdiplomacy was crystal clear: language is power. Bismarck’s judgment which belongs

to the 1898, unveiled its accuracy only a few years later, with the entry of the United
States in the First World War alongside Britain and against Germany and the AustroHungary, an empire united by a common German language.

The power of the language originates in the myth of the “Babel Tower”, which makes
us comprehend that having a single language implies and constitutes an extraordinary
power. According to the myth, 5 generations had passed since the Great Flood, when
they said: “Let us raise a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make
_us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth”. God came_
down to see what they did and confused their languages, and God “there confounded
_the languages of all the Earth”, leaving people in a chaos of communication._

in their hegemonic role. Greek and Latin are thanks to Greece and Rome, the world’s

major languages of their antique existence. In the VII century, Arabs sought to impose
by their religion and language their hegemony over the world. They managed to do
this in the entire Middle East, North Africa and in the southern European peninsula.
In the sixteenth century, the time of the great extra European discoveries, the hegemony
seemed to be divided between Portuguese and Spanish. Seventeenth century is the
century of Russian and French[1]. English begins its ascent starting from the eighteenth
century. It is the hegemonic language of the twentieth century[2].

The German geopolitical scholar Carl Haushofer related the German domain with
the scope of extension of the German language. When these great changes occur in
the map of states, often the language coherences are privileged to the detriment of
any other criterion. The case of Magyar population is a typical example how it
constituted the basis of the Hungarian nationalism. After the Treaty of Trianon (1918),
the Magyar state was stripped of all provinces where the majority language was not
the Magyar language[3]. Some multi-ethnic states were faced with the problem of
linguistic dispersion. This is the case of Papuasia-New Guinea, divided between
Melanesian world and the Papu world and there are in the oriental island more than
400 distinct spoken languages[4].

Language is an internal identity factor and an instrument of the power abroad.
Linguistic unity is often necessary for a state to set the internal stability and project
itself in the world. But despite its importance, language is not the only geopolitical
factor. In the former Yugoslavia, Serbian-Croatian language, 90 years ago, seemed
to give unity to the Federal State. This unity was merely a facade; deep identity
tensions linked to ethnic and religious differences stirred the country and provoked
the outburst of country turbulences. Geopolitics is an interdisciplinary science which
must reject monism: its reflections should summarize the data and the determining
factors. Collection of factors is not enough: one should know as well how to put
them together in an innovative way, by establishing a link to any situation which is
an object of study.
**“Geopolitics of languages” in the international arena**

There are many ways of studying the interrelated issue of the relationship between
languages and policies. Geopolitics is just one of them. If geopolitics deals with the
study of political processes in a spatial context, the political role of language is an
important element of geopolitics and geopolitics itself is an instrument through which
we study the interrelated issue of the relationship between language and policies, not

only in political institutions, but also in political behaviour between states and within
the state itself. The issue of language or language acquisition policy has a significant
impact on the process of forming the state geopolitical structures, but also in
establishing the basic foundations of international relations of the state.

Language is not only a major defining characteristic of the political identity of
individuals, groups or states, but also the most natural element of political behaviour.
Choice of a language for use in a wider communication, the choice of which language
is studied, bilingualism or the decision not to learn other languages comprise the
best examples of our political behaviour. The study of these aspects can tell us much
about internal and international policies while it is also an indicator in the analysis
of political institutions.

The spread of languages is not based only in the number of its speakers, but also in
the economic, technological and political strength which lies behind the decision to
use a language. Therefore, the expansion of the territory where the language is spoken,
decrease or increase of rivalries among languages is mostly a product of geopolitical
processes and changes. Study of the bilateral relationship among language, politics
and territory helps us in understanding the development of global, regional and local
development.
**Language geopolitics at the global level: English and French**

Supranational languages are languages that are not related to a political nation. Such
languages are spoken in more than a political nation. Speakers of these languages
can be further divided into three groups: speakers of the language as mother tongue,
speakers of the language as a second language and language speakers as a foreign
language. This typology is widely used by sociolinguists, but this division is possible
to use also in geopolitical categories[5].

It is possible to include in the first category states in which are spoken mostly
supranational languages, or the language is spoken as their mother tongue by an essential
part of the citizens of the state. The second category includes countries where the
language is not widely spoken as a supranational language by the citizens as their
mother tongue, but it is used as a lingua franca and it has an official status in these
countries. There are countries in which supranational languages constitute a second
language. The third category includes states where the supranational language has no
official status, but the state education policy encourages the spread of this language as
a language of wider communication, especially at the international level. In this category
it is possible to include countries where there is an education policy to promote the
spread of a concrete supranational language as a language of wider international
communication, but most of the population of a country uses the supranational language
as a foreign language and more often, as the first foreign language.

In the category of supranational global languages can be included a language that is
not only widely spoken as a native language, but is also widely spoken, especially as

5 Kachru, B. (1986): The Alchemy of English. Oxford: Pergamon.

_Language, a vital factor of national geopolitics_

a second language and as a foreign language in various macro-regions of the world.
Only two languages can be included in this category, English and French.

**The international status of language in geopolitical terms**

The reasons why a language takes the status of international language is not related
to only the number of people who speak it, but much more it is related to those who
are “its speakers”. Latin became an international language through the Roman Empire
and it did not come because the Romans were more numerous than the peoples they
conquered. They were simply more powerful. Later, when the Roman military power
declined, Latin language remained for a millennium as the international language of
education, thanks to a different kind of power, that of Roman Catholicism.

However, a language does not become an international language because of its
structural qualities, or because of the size of its vocabulary, or because it was the
means of creating a great literature in the past, or because it was associated with a
great culture or religion. Obviously, such factors might motivate someone to learn a
language, but cannot possibly provide the cause for the global spread of a language.
Indeed, such factors cannot even guarantee the survival of a language as a living one
and in use, and we have the case of Latin, as a language that is studied today simply
as a classical language by a small number of researchers[6].

There is a very close connection between dominance of a language and economic,
technological cultural power and that this relation becomes increasingly clear if we
refer to the history of the English language. Without possession of a strong government
and a force of any kind, no language can make progress as a means of international
communication. Language does not exist in a kind of mystical space, separate and
independent from the people who speak it. Language exists only in the brains, mouths,
ears, hands and eyes of its users. When they are successful in the international arena,
their language also succeed, when they fail, their language also fails.
**English as the first global language**

English is definitely in the category of global supranational languages. Current status
that English language enjoys in the world today is largely the result of two factors:
the expansion of British colonial power, which peaked towards the end of the
nineteenth century and the emergence of the United States as the leading economic
power of the twentieth century. The last factor is exactly the one to explain the
global position of English today.

According to another approach, status of English as a global language is explained
referring to two aspects: it geographic-historical and socio-cultural aspect as well.
Geo-historical perspective shows how English reached a primary position in the
world and he explains why the socio-cultural aspect explains why such domination
remains as such. This was a language spread which followed the colonial expansions
of the nineteenth century in Africa and the South Pacific and received a significant
increase when this language was adopted as the official language or semi-official

language in the mid-twentieth century by many countries that became new newly
independent states. English is already represented on every continent, as well as in
the islands of the three major oceans.

In 1960s, the ascendancy of this language was increasing, but since that time one
could not describe it as a truly international language. Since then, two events have
ensured its international status. The first was the movement towards political
independence of some countries, in which English emerged as a language with special
status. In most of these countries, the role of English was so great that no other
language could compete with it. The second event was the electronic revolution, and
in this case, English was in the right place (the U.S.) at the right time (the 70’s of last
century).

The socio-cultural aspect explains how people across the world, in many areas of
life, are dependent on English for their economic and social wellbeing. The
development of computers, in the twentieth century, has been almost entirely an
American business. The first computer operating systems were in English, and as
one can see the instructions in MSDOS systems, but also to the later operating systems
who replaced DOS, which are affected by the influence of English, although there
alternatives in other languages. It is precisely this hegemony and distribution that
makes English labelled as “global language” in reality. It is also known that English
has a dominant position in the Internet, while about 80 percent of information stored
electronically is in English, and in doing, English is the first “Lingua franca’’ of the
Internet. This language has penetrated deeply into the areas of international politics,
business, security, communications, entertainment, media and education. The ease
of having a lingua franca available to human relations and global needs is estimated
by millions of people.

**Geopolitical scenarios of English language**
**The “English prevails” scenario**

“English prevails” is a term that presents the world with a simple scenario which
suggests the spread of this language in the entire world and it embodies the likelihood
constant spread or the prevalence of English also in the future. A language achieves
a truly global status when it plays a special role that is recognized in every country.
Such a role is more apparent in countries where a large number of people speak the
language as their mother tongue. In the case of English, the countries include U.S,
Canada, UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, some countries in
the Caribbean and several other territories of the world. No other language is spoken
as “native language” by such a great a number of people scattered in so many
territories/countries around the globe (Only Spanish leads in this sense since it is
spoken in 20 countries mainly in Latin America). The use as native language only in
a country, however large population numbers is, fails to give to it the global language
status. In order to achieve such a status, a language should be used by other countries
around the world who decide to give it a special place and role within their
communities, even though the number they may have, consists of few speakers who
use this language as their mother tongue

_Language, a vital factor of national geopolitics_

English achieved this status through two main ways: first, it managed to become the
official language of several countries being used as a communication tool in
institutions such as government, courts, media and the educational system. In order
to enter in such lines it is extremely important that the language is possessed as early
as possible in the life of the individual. Such language is often described as a “second
language”, since it is considered as complementing the native language or the first
language of the individual. English today enjoys a special status in over seventy
countries, such as Ghana, Nigeria, India, Singapore, etc. Secondly, a language can
become a priority as part of the educational program in foreign language learning in
a place, even though this language has no official status in the respective country,
thus becoming the language which children are more likely to learn when they enter
school. English is now the language most widely taught as a foreign language, in
over 100 countries, such as China, Russia, Germany, Spain, Egypt and Brazil and in
most of these countries emerges as the main foreign language encountered in schools,
thus displacing another language. In 1996, for example, English moved or replaced
French as a foreign language in primary schools in Algeria (a former French colony).
Here we can mention the case of Albania, where very soon Russian was replaced by
English but also in French as a foreign language taught in state schools, while in
accordance with a Governmental decision, English is introduced as part of the Matura
state exams in higher schools.

Due to the development of this multirole language as “first”, “second” and “foreign”
language, this language is used today by a much larger number of people around the
world, compared to any other language used before. English has already reached the
stage of a global language. About a quarter of the world population is fluent speakers
or competent speakers of English and the figure at the beginning of the new millennium
was steadily increasing, which means about 1.5 billion of the world population.

**Scenario of the fall of English as a global language**

The history of the languages used as the “lingua franca” has shown us repeatedly
that we must be careful when we make predictions about the future of a language. If
in middle Ages, anyone would dare to predict the decline of the Latin language as the
language of education, people will not take those people seriously. Similarly, in the
eighteenth century, if someone would have suggested that a language other than
French would be used in the future as the language of politics and high society, no
one would have taken this seriously.

The “time: factor is conceived differently in politics and differently in linguistics. A
week for politics can be an even longer period, while a century in linguistics is
considered as a short period. However, there are scenarios considering the decline of
a language from the global language status. In the submission and analysis of scenarios
that could affect the decline of English as the “lingua franca” can be defined some
options. A change in the balance of power political, economic, technological or
cultural, can affect the establishment of the status of other languages that English
enjoys today. If the dominance of a language is a matter of political influence, and
especially economic influence, then just after a revolution in the balance of power in
the globe, there may have consequences for the choice of the global language.

_Granit Zela, Silvana Markgjonaj_

Despite the remarkable growth in the number of users of English, at least two-thirds
of the world’s population still does not use it. In some parts of the world (in most
states of the former Soviet Union, for example), English still has a limited presence.
In some other countries, there are increasing financial resources to keep the role of
other languages (such as French, in some African countries).
**The “translation machine scenario” as a global communication method**

Another scenario is much more reliable is the emergence of another alternative method
of communication which can eliminate the need for global languages. Here we can
mention the translating automatic “translation machine”. If progress in this area
continues to be as fast as in the past decade, there is a possibility that, within a
generation or two, this method will become a routine for people to communicate
with each other directly, using their first languages.

Anyway, given the speed with which it was developed the scenario of the emergence
of English, it is impossible to make predictions about the emergence of another
language so worldwide. Within more than a generation, we have moved from a
situation where the existence of a world language appeared as a theoretical possibility,
into a situation where it is a visible reality.

Given that the U.S. has become the most dominant element in almost all areas of
activity, the future of English depends to some extent on the future of this country.
The greatest power that has fuelled the growth and strengthening of this language
during the twentieth century has come from United States of America.
**French as a supranational global language: Francophone**

French has also the geopolitical ambition to be a global supranational language. As a
native language, it is certainly widely spoken in France, while as minority language
it is spoken in Canada, Belgium and Switzerland. French is the official language in
Luxembourg, in many African countries, of which the largest number of speakers of
French as a second language is in Ivory Coast, the Democratic Republic of Congo,
Cameroon, Senegal and Congo (Brazzaville). In the group of countries that recognize
French as a language of international communication, the largest numbers of French
speakers are in Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and Lebanon. Francophone space is a
cultural, political and economic weight that lies on five continents. It encompasses
53 member states and governments and 10 observers, representing more than 10 %
of the world population-less than 1 % of the world population is French. Member
States belong to five continents and meet every two years at the Francophone summit.

Francophone space that extends to five continents is constantly expanding. And this
space is also an important macro-economic reality. 90 %, of this economic wealth of
this area is concentrated in four countries-France, Canada, Switzerland and Belgium,
but macro-economic dimension of the Francophone is already a reality: 10 % of the
world population, 12 % of world production and 17 % of international commercial
exchanges.

The francophone project, since it extends in five continents, sometimes runs counter
to the dynamics of regionalization and the formation of integrated continental blocks.

_Language, a vital factor of national geopolitics_

In a geographical viewpoint, it is ascertained that many countries in central Europe,
Eastern Asia and aspire to integrate into Francophone. In France, the Francophone
project protected by partisans of a France that is a world power and balance. This is
a Francophone that is based on the pillars of this worldwide France. Francophone
offers a flourishing geopolitical, economic and cultural potential[7]. And when France
doubts about herself, when European project is undergoing a profound identity crisis,
when many people are wondering about the meaning of mondialism, it is time that
the French elites do not smile anymore when it comes to talk about Francophone[8].
Some states recognize internal language borders. It is the case of Commonwealth
member states or the Francophone in the African continent (Cameroon and Mauritius).
The internal geopolitical analysis of states is related to the fact of drawing the lines
of division in determining the identity and defining the internal linguistic boundaries.
**Geopolitics of languages at the regional and sub-regional level: the Case**
**of the European Union**

The complicated problem of the roles of the national European languages within the
EU is perhaps the biggest obstacle to further economic and political integration.
First of all, it is necessary to keep in mind the special position of national languages
in the political cultures of the Europeans. Historians are wondering about the
nineteenth century as an era of nationalism, but it is true that the majority of European
nation-states are a product of the twentieth century and this process has probably not
finished yet as suggested by some national movements in certain parts of Europe.

Despite the circumstances, the position of supranational languages in the European
integration process is even more complicated because of poor language policies in
the EU. Results vary widely in different countries and are much better in countries
with “small” national languages, but statistics show that only half of the population
of the EU is able to communicate in a language other than the mother tongue. The
best position is that of English, with 40 % of non-native speakers in the EU, followed
by French with 20%, German with 10 % and Spanish with 6 %.

In order to understand the position of English in the EU, it is necessary to note that
this is a language which began to dominate in the EU administration, only after
enlargement in 1995[9]. The second factor limiting the role of the position of English
is “special” role of French, since the beginning of the integration process, until at
least 1995, as the first EU language and the preservation of the special position
mainly due to the EU “capitals” (Brussels, Strasbourg, Luxembourg) which are in a
francophone area. An eastern expansion can improve the position of English, but
will also strengthen the position of the German language, which is now the language
most widely spoken as a native language after the unification of Germany and Austria’s
entry into the EU.

Linguistic diversity is an important element of the cultural wealth of European culture,
but in geopolitical view, it is one of the most important factors towards the creation

of a single economic market, with a trans-national work toward the establishment of
a European political identity. In comparison to other macro-regional groups, we can
say that the EU, without admission of “a language policy of a single official language”,
is by having a smaller chance of creating a unified geopolitical unit, a chance that is
to smaller than let us say The Arab League .

Central Europe is probably the most debated traditionally sub-region in the geopolitical
perspective. In a geopolitical discourse on this region, there are different theories.
One of them is a theory according to which Central Europe serves as a “bridge”
between Central and Eastern Europe, a concept of “Mitteleuropa”. Another idea is
that Central Europe is like a “periphery” of the West[ 10 ]. All these concepts work with
the important role of a lingua franca which helps in communication between the
peoples of the sub-region. Germany is the country that has traditionally played this
role. This has not changed with the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire or the
establishment of the “Iron Curtain”.

France was not successful in her bid to replace Germany in the 1920s and 1930s, and
the same thing happened with the Russian language during the Cold War era. Only
after the fall of communism in this sub-region, doors were opened for massive use of
English. It is too early to predict that English will completely replace the traditional
role of German language. For the moment it seems that this is likely to happen more
in some places of this area as Slovenia, Czech Republic, and Poland than in countries
such as Hungary and Slovakia. Even with this scenario, it is possible to expect that
Germany will remain in a strong position in all these countries, especially in border
areas with Germany and Austria.

In general, it is possible to say that at in a sub-regional level there are more linguistic
international organizations or organizations with a main communication language
than there are in a macro-regional level. In the geopolitical perspective, it means that
in global politics, an international sub-regional cooperation can be more frequent,
more concrete and more effective than at the macro-regional level. Europe is a good
example in this case.

It is hard to predict that English will be accepted fully in all areas of the EU as the
only main language of communication. This will be the main problem for the EU,
the inability to fully function as a fully integrated geopolitical unit in economic,
cultural and political terms. But some EU countries are already recognizing the role
of English, especially in countries with “smaller” national languages. As a result of
different approaches to the role of English, a kind of gap between these countries
and other countries maybe created, especially regarding those countries having the
ambitions that their national languages play a wider role in linguistic communication
with the EU.

We have a very different situation if Europe is considered in a sub-regional perspective.
At this level, these sub-regions are clearly unified by a language. Not only British

_Language, a vital factor of national geopolitics_

Isles, a francophone Europe and German speaking countries, but in this category are
included such regions but also Spain can be included as a regional state (Portugal, in
areas where people have difficulty understanding the Spanish) Italy is another example
of a regional state and Benelux Dutch speaking areas. In other parts of Europe (Nordic
countries, Central Europe, the Balkans) sub-regional cooperation can be transformed
to create a geopolitically unified integration with the acceptance of a common lingua
franca.

The very close economic, cultural and political sub-regional integration is possible
among countries that mutually understand each other’s languages. This happens in
the case of the three Scandinavian countries, Finland and Estonia, the Czech Republic
and Slovakia, Romania, Moldova, Bulgaria and Macedonia, but also, perhaps in
cooperation between the countries of former Yugoslavia (Serbia, Montenegro, BosniaHerzegovina and Croatia). Consequently, it can be foreseen that the EU, in geopolitical
terms, is likely to be a complex of mutual cooperation (but competitive) of subregions within the EU, more than a unified player on the global stage.

If in the sub-regional level of international policies, supranational languages play a
limited role, only in special occasions, multi-linguistics clusters at the level of the
nation-state the role of supranational languages has traditionally been always
important and continues to be so.
**Languages at national level: Albanian language**
**Geographical extension of the Albanian language**

The Albanian language is spoken by over six million people in the south-western
Balkans, primarily in the Republic of Albania and in the neighbouring countries which
once formed part of the Yugoslav federation (Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and
Serbia). In Albania itself, the language is spoken by the entire population of 3,087,159
inhabitants (census of April 2001), including some bilingual ethnic minorities.

In Kosovo, where there are as yet no reliable population statistics, Albanian is spoken
by almost the entire population of about two million individuals, including some
bilingual minorities: Bosnians, Turks, Croats and Roma. Ethnic Serbs in Kosovo
(now about five percent of the population) have traditionally refused to learn or speak
Albanian, but attitudes may change once traditional hostilities and ethnic tensions
subside.

The Republic of Macedonia is estimated to have at least half a million Albanian
speakers, equalling about twenty-five percent of the total population of the republic,
although there are no reliable statistics. The Albanian population is to be found in
and around Skopje (Alb. Shkup), where it constitutes a substantial minority, Kumanova
and, in particular, in western Macedonia from Tetova, Gostivar and Dibra down to
Struga, where it forms the majority.

A minority of about 50,000 Albanian speakers is also to be found in Montenegro,
mostly along the Albanian border (Ulqin-Ulcinj, Tuz and Gucia/Gusinje). There are
also at least 70,000 to 100,000 Albanian speakers scattered throughout southern
Serbia, primarily in the Presheva Valley near the borders of Macedonia and Kosovo.

To the south of Albania, in Greece, there are traditional settlements of Çamëria dialect
speakers, in particular around Parga and Igoumenitsa in Epirus. Despite border
changes and deportations to Albania, the Albanian population here may be as high as
100,000, although they are highly assimilated. In central Greece, the Albanian
language, known in Albanian as Arbërisht and in Greek as Arvanitika, languishes in
about 320 villages, primarily those of Boeotia (especially around Levadhia), southern
Euboea, Attica, Corinth and northern Andros. These speakers are the descendants of
large-scale Albanian emigration to Greece during the late middle Ages. No official
statistics exist as to their numbers. This exceptionally archaic form of Albanian is
dying out rapidly[ 11].

In southern Italy, there is a small but well-established Albanian-speaking minority,
the so-called _Arbëresh, or Italo­Albanians. These are the descendants of refugees_
who fled Albania after the death of Scanderbeg in 1468. As a linguistic group, the
Arbëresh now consist of about 90,000 speakers, most of who live in the mountain
villages of Cosenza in Calabria and in the vicinity of Palermo in Sicily. The Arbëresh
speak an archaic dialect of Albanian, which differs substantially from the Albanian
now spoken in the Balkans, to the extent that communication is difficult if Arbëresh
speakers are not familiar with standard literary Albanian.

Traditional Albanian settlements can be encountered sporadically elsewhere in the
Balkans: in Arbanasi, a suburb of Zadar on the Dalmatian coast of Croatia; in some
villages in the Sandjak in Serbia and in the Bulgarian-Greek-Turkish border region,
notably in the Bulgarian village of Mandrica. A few Albanian speakers are also to be
found in the Ukraine, notably in villages in the regions of Melitopol and Odessa.

Little remains of the once extensive colonies of Albanians scattered throughout the
Ottoman Empire. The Albanian minority in Egypt has now dissipated, though Albanian
communities still exist in large numbers in Turkey (Istanbul, Bursa and elsewhere)
and to an extent in Syria, notably in Damascus.

Since the late 1980s in Kosovo and since the opening of Albania in 1990-1991, there
has been a substantial emigration of Albanian speakers from their traditional areas
of settlement to other countries, in particular to Greece and Italy. There are also large
numbers of Albanian emigrants to be found in Western Europe (esp. Germany,
Switzerland, Scandinavia and London) and in North America (New York, Boston,
Detroit, Toronto)[12].
**Ban of writing Albanian language, an instrument of Albanian identity**
**dissolution**

The French geopolitical scholar Jacquel Ancel notes that in nineteenth-century Europe,
language played a determining role in the building of new nations. This was the case
of Albania, located in the area of the common influence of Latin, Greek and Turkish,
and which based its uniqueness in an original Albanian language[13].

_Language, a vital factor of national geopolitics_

“A nation lives with his language,” says a Hungarian proverb. Among all the major
languages of the Balkan Peninsula, Albanian language is the only language, whose
writing was banned for five hundred years. I do not know any other country in the
European continent, says Ismail Kadare, whose language has undergone such a horror.
Why? How was this considered afterwards, why it wasn’t changed over the centuries,
and how did this language survive till the end of the Ottoman Empire, will the last
moments of the dying empire? Albanians were allowed many things: they were
allowed to have churches, properties, high ranks in the army of the administration,
even imperial post of the vizier (Prime minister), which they had several times, but
they were never allowed to have only one right: writing the Albanian language. This
was a real ban, dramatic and irreversible. I do not believe that you can find in the
world history of education, such times when the teachers and kids, when caught
secretly writing or teaching a language, they were immediately massacred without
mercy and without remorse.

Exactly at that time, the impetus of self-protection mechanism in action put again
into use an older mechanism: oral literature. Up in the mountains, there where it
remained a budding light, ancient machines were shaken again. This mechanism had
always been there, but somehow it had been outside attention, especially since the
time that the Albanians had learned to write, and to publish books in Latin, as all
Europeans know. (One of them, the priest from Shkodra Marin Barleti, was already
translated into all European languages). The mechanism had been there, except now,
in the days of the apocalypse, it was obvious that the country needed it most[14]. Kadare
goes back again to this unique action in the Ottoman Empire: the ban of writing the
Albanian language, recalling the symbolism of the survival of the Albanian language
which during this time period was not really alive, but without which one cannot
imagine European civilization[15].
**“Linguistic hierarchy” geopolitics facing the Albanian language nowadays**

Mastery of a foreign language has always been a priority for individuals and this is
no exception also for the Albanian society. Contacts with the invaders, military service,
seasonal employment in neighbouring countries and migrations have been some of
the factors responsible for the bilingual reality Albanian- foreign language.
Monolingualism has always been a characteristic of the closed societies. When it
comes to bilingualism, one should distinguish between individual bilingualism and
collective bilingualism. While collective bilingualism is characteristic of ethniclinguistic minorities or border areas, individual bilingualism depends largely on the
state’s language policies. Even in our country, the individual bilingualism has been
fostered by the state, by introducing compulsory subjects in the school of foreign
languages. Of course, the type of foreign language in the bilingual individual has
changed. In the first half of the last century, Italian language was in the first place, in
the second half, until the beginning of the 1970’s the first place belonged to Russian
language, and afterwards Russian began to be marginalized from English and French.
After 1990, this paradigm has changed significantly.

The results of the survey of young people in Albania show that some languages have
lost significantly their position, as it occurs in the cases of Russian and French,
while other languages like English, Italian and Greek have become more favourite.
Thus, according to the Euro Barometer (1995), in 1000 young people surveyed, 29
% of them spoke Italian, English was spoken by 22 %, 7 % and 6 % spoke Greek and
French. In the study “Post-Communist Albanian Youth”, conducted by the Centre
for Sociological Studies “EUREKA”, 2600 young people were surveyed, and 47 %
of them preferred English, 34.6 % Italian, 10.3 % German, 5.3 % French and 1.5 %
Greek. A little bit different data came out of another survey conducted in those years
with 697 young people regarding foreign languages they understood and spoke, out
of which the first place was held by Italian 40.3 %, then English 38.5 %, French
10%, Greek and German 3.6% 1%.

In terms of European wide integration, foreign language learning is gaining a new
dimension. This is the reason why this issue occupies an important place in many
conventions and documents of EU, EC, OSCE and the many organizations for
protection of human rights. “White Paper on Education and Education” (1995) of
the European Union, in its Chapter IV “Possession of three foreign languages” notes
“Possession of several languages of the European Union has become a prerequisite
for EU citizens in order to benefit from the personal and employment opportunities
that were opened in the single borderless market. This mastery of language should
result in the ability to adapt to working and living in different cultures. Languages
are also the key to get to know the others. Mastering of languages helps the formation
of a sense of being European, with all its diversity and cultural richness and
understanding between citizens of Europe.

In accordance with the resolution dated 31.03.1995 of the EU Council of Ministers
of Education, it is becoming a necessity for everyone, regardless of the ways adopted
for education, to gain and retain the ability to communicate in at least two EU
languages besides their mother tongue... In order to achieve mastery of three EU
languages, it is desirable that the teaching of foreign languages since the elementary
school. This education is necessary to be done on regular basis in the elementary
education, and with the learning of a EU second foreign language in high school. It
may not seem impossible that high school students study some subjects in the second
foreign language. When ending school education everyone should speak fluently
two EU foreign languages”.

This document, which must be implemented by Albania as a candidate to join the
European Union, makes clear what are the foreign languages to be learned and what
are the policies to be followed for their learning during undergraduate education. It
leaves no room for improvisation or preferences of individuals. On the basis of this
document we should also build our state language policies regarding foreign languages
to be taught in school and the number of these languages.

Among international languages, undoubtedly priority should be given to English,
which should be the first foreign language (L1). The teaching of English should start
in elementary school. Other international languages should be the second languages
(L2), while languages of neighbours such as Italian, Greek or German languages

107

_Language, a vital factor of national geopolitics_

must be L3, languages which are in the border areas with these countries could be
L2, which means they could change places with L2 international languages, but in
no case can be L1. This position will also stop the tendency of any country for a
higher status of their language, even in special areas. Such long-term policies built
on the basis of EU legislation and in consultation with the experts, are to be built
also for the university and postgraduate education. They would also give assistance
our Ministry of Education legal support in their implementation in practice[16].
**Conclusions**

In conclusion, we can emphasize that the use and spread of languages constitutes a
reliable indicator of geopolitical processes. This use can be explored in different
kinds of tongues, in a language geopolitical perspective. Scattered languages, regional
languages, languages of national or supranational languages, show and reflect the
geopolitical dynamics of global politics. But the most visible role is played by
supranational languages, especially in political processes at the sub-regional
integration, macro-regional or international policies.

A unique role is played by global languages, English and to a lesser extent, French.
These languages, the same as other supra-national languages, are helping to deepen
cultural; economic and political integration and development among countries
populated by speakers of the same language, but can also function as a “cementing”
factor of the integration processes in the regions where these languages are not widely
spoken as a mother tongue. English is playing this role in macro-regional level, i.e.
in the Indian subcontinent or Southeast Asia, at the sub-regional level in South Africa
or in the Nordic countries. French plays a similar role, e.g. in Western Equatorial
Africa. Both languages can even be a component of the identity of several larger
monolingual sub-regional groupings, since it is obvious the role of English in the
Gulf or in the case of French in the Maghreb.

Globalization in economic, cultural and political terms does not mean only a deepening
trend towards linguistic uniformity. Due to demographic trends and due to the
regionalism processes in global politics, the geopolitical role of other supra-national
global languages is increasingly growing. This is especially true with respect to the
role of such languages as Mandarin language, Indian, Spanish or Arabic. Globalization
is also associated more with bilingualism than with the monolingualism, which was,
in geopolitical perspective, a product of the creation of the nation-state system and
the product of nationalism and imperialism. Decentralization of political power within
a nation-state, as a by-product of the process of supranational integration of global
politics, fostering of the regional bilingualism, due to the use and knowledge of a
local language as well as a supranational language is very significant in regions of
the world to the political identity of citizens as much as the use and knowledge of the
“national” language in itself.

Governments that wish to play their part in influencing the future of the world language
must consider the policy decisions and allocation of resources for language planning.

Now, more than ever in the language history, they need to adopt long-term platform
and plan to advance their interests and to promote the development of their language
or the use of other languages in their community. If this linguistic chance is not used
properly, there may not be another chance anymore.

Language, being the main tool of cultural expression, is also one of its basic
dimensions. The role of languages grows even more in the context of European
integration. In terms of an open society, language is facing the same risks and problems
as well as the culture it carries. This because the responsible state levels are not
aware of the imperative necessity of developing such policies and legislation that
would protect the Albanian language from the pressure of foreign languages within
and outside their ethnic territories and in the Diaspora, where the Albanian language
is in contact with different languages. This approach would ensure that the intact
status of the first language within state borders and would help the Albanian
government to ensure an acceptable status of Albanian in areas where it is in contact
with other languages. Not only efforts are not being made to draft an appropriate
language policy for an open society, but it is now recognized well also the European
and international legislation on issues of minority native languages, although it is
almost entirely translated in our language and published by the Council of Europe .

PhD Ahmet Leka, trying to give answers to the following questions: Why a
study for the development of the strategic doctrinal thought of AF in the
post war period, mostly during Cold War period is important? How the
strategic concepts for the defence and the security environment in the global
and regional context have evolved? What was the impact of political and
ideological rapport of that era in the development of military strategy? Why
do we study the organization, modernization and development of military
theory of that period and what is its value nowadays? How is the future
reflected in the present, in terms of security for small countries like our
country?

The paper of PhD Eduart Bala focuses on the relationships and cooperation
between Al Qaeda, other international terrorist organizations, Islamic NGOs,
and Islamic legal businesses in Albania, and how the Albania government
has responded to this activity. It provides a brief overview of Albania setting
at the beginning of the post communist period, followed by a description of
the various Islamic NGOs, emerging in this period and their involvement in
support of terrorist activities in the country, and concludes with a discussion
of how the Albanian government has reacted to this threat, based on the case
study.

Col (R) Thimi Hudhra emphasizes that the fulfilment of the strategic goal of
membership in the Alliance, is not the end of our efforts. This does not
mean that the integration process is closed. In this context, the key question
is how to become one of the respected members of the Alliance, with both
the benefits and the obligations stemming from the membership.

##### Albanian Military Strategic Thought and the organization of
 the Armed Forces of the Republic of Albania 1945-1991

**Short commentary. This paper addresses and provides comprehensive knowledge**
_about the track followed by our Armed Forces after World War II, for their_
_development and evolution until 90-ies. During this period the development of military_
_strategy and the Armed Forces has been an entire process of evolution and_
_improvement, of quantitative and qualitative changes through permanent efforts and_
_by facing many difficulties and obstacles of the time._

_Questions that arise are: Why a study for the development of the strategic doctrinal_
_thought of AF in the post war period, mostly during Cold War period? How has the_
_strategic concept for the defence evolved? How has the security environment in the_
_global and regional context evolved? What was the impact of political and ideological_
_rapport of that era in the development of military strategy? Why do we study the_
_organization, modernization and development of military theory of that period and_
_what is its value nowadays? How is the future reflected in the present in terms of_
_security for small countries like our country? Such questions were and still are part_
_of the research work of different scholars, policymakers and military theoreticians._
_In this paper I try to give some answers to these questions._

_The answers to these questions were not so simple, for it is a past period full of_
_values in regard to historical prospect, but from the point of view of research related_
_to military thought, it is valid for the present and for the future._

_This paper analyzes the impact of military strategic thoughts in different periods_
_and based on it highlights the need for conceptual, doctrinal and structural_
_improvements in order to reflect and attain the best values in military field. There_
_are some tendencies in military theory, there is also a history of development,_
_consequently there is a practical terrain to judge about that period of establishment,_
_organization and modernization of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Albania_
_(AFRA) during the whole period of post war until the establishment of democracy in_
_1990. The purpose of the paper can be clearly stated by the saying “There is no_
_ready-made solution for human kind despite understanding the past”._

_The Albanian Military Strategic Thought, 1945-1991_

**Albania has a rich military tradition**

Information on the history of the wars of the Albanian people from antiquity until
nowadays comes from foreign authors, and particularly from the Roman and Greek
scholars, especially from Herodotus, Polybius, Livy, Pliny, Strabo, Barleti etc. In the
following lines the paper will present some highlights of developments in the field
of strategic thinking and concepts of the Albanian armed forces, from antiquity until
today, creating the so-called “Albanian military tradition”. Illyrian armies were some
of the most remarkable armies of that time, and their military organization represents
the most characteristic features of the Illyrian state.” Agron, king of the Illyrians and
son of Peurat, commanded a navy and infantry much larger than previous kings of
Illyria.” Illyrian military tradition was enriched further in the VII century and later in
the state of Arber where the army consisted of feudal lords and along with this there
existed the institution of “people into military service”, which consisted of free
peasants. If we come much later in the period of Skanderbeg, we notice the peak of
the history of wars in the period of country conquest by the Ottoman Empire.
Skanderbeg organized the permanent army of peacetime and temporary army for
wartime. The regular and permanent army which had to be ready any time, gained
prominence.[1]

League of Prizren in the period 1878-1881 is a culmination of the history of Albania,
therefore, it is considered as such for its Armed Forces. League created a volunteer
army, based on the principle “one man for each family.” In this period, the
Mohammedans and Christians were closely related and were all soldiers. Each tribe
had its fortified place, each fighter had his rifle on the shoulder...”.[2] Another period
of military developments is the time of the Declaration of Independence. At that
time, only 6 days after the proclamation of independence the National Army was
established. Its main constituent structures were: active forces, reserve forces,
volunteer forces, gendarmerie with 12,000 people.[3] In October 1913, by a Decision
of the Conference of Ambassadors in London, a group of Dutch military people
(Dutch officers Deweer and Thomson, as well as 15 other officers) helped to
restructure, prepare and establish the Albanian gendarmerie.

During the monarchy, the Armed Forces carried out internal changes that were
positively estimated for the time, as in terms of military thought, and in organization.
The army remained divided into infantry, navy, and air force but the most important
was infantry. Despite the continous projects and the laws of 1929, 1930, 1931, 1934
and 1937 Army organization remained at the size of the group.[4] During this period
the growth of the military budget was considerable, as well. With the occupation of
Albania by fascist Italy on 7 April 1939, the state together with the Armed Forces
became non-existent. In such circumstances, new armed forces emerged belonging

to different political groups of the time and they faced the invaders. The greatest
force, with a stable organizational scheme and very willing, with disciplined offensive
formations, with a progressive numerical increase and with a General Staff, was the
Antifascist Volunteer National Liberation Army. This Army succeeded to have 24
army brigades, 8 divisions and 3 armycorps, approximately with 45.000 fighters and
is considered the most successful army after 1912. The main basic formation was
brigade, while the division was a formation of operational level, able to perform the
operations separately.[ 5] In November 1944 together with the territorial forces this
army had 70.000 people. This figure consisted of 7 % of the Albanian population of
that period.

**Manifestations of the development of the military thought**
**and organization of Armed Forces in the period 1945-1960**

After the liberation of the country attention was concentrated on those components
that constitute not only the establishment and the qualitative organization of the
Armed Forces but also the continuous and qualitative development of strategical
and doctrinal concepts. According to the strategical concept of the time, defense of
the just liberated country, the organization and preparation e AF, and the development
of theoritical thought on military strategy, should respond to the real conditions and
circumstances of the progress of the country.

At the same time, the political leadership of the country, fearing not only “the foreign
enemies”, but also the “home reaction”, followed the course of arming both the AF
and the whole “soldier people”, relying on and executing Lenin’s teachings, who
stressed that: “As long as there are oppressed and exploited people in the world we
should require not the disarmament of the people, but the general armament of them.
Only this will fully ensure the freedom. Only this will repress reaction.”[6]

Following these steps, the main directions of development of the AF were:
establishment and constant perfection of organizational forms; creation and constant
perfection of kinds of forces and services and the best harmonized rapports among
them; equipment with modern technique and armament responding to the cohesive
requirements of a feasable war and the progress of science and technology; high
level of preparation of commands, staffs and leading personnel; education and training
of the entire manpower with the love for their country and people; the use of rational,
efficient and original forms for the highest level of activation of reserve forces and
their role at the same level with active forces, etc.

The Albanian Army of the post war was mainly composed of infantry forces inherited
from the National Liberation Army. Its contingents were mostly those of the war
time, who in general lacked military culture, professional and management skills
and especially the required theoritical and military level, as a necessity for a modern
and contemporary army.

_The Albanian Military Strategic Thought, 1945-1991_

Apart from other things, to transform this army that just had left war, into a modern
army, it was necessary to fulfill some essential criteria in altered conditions. Different
military scholars have made efforts to “find” and highlight the values of an “original”
_military art, and like their civilian colleagues, have greatly respected historical logic_
_of “traditional Albanian resistance for survival”.[7]_ Thus, in the new conditions of the
country, in case of a feasable confrontation, our army had to confront adversaries
and modern armies that relied on advanced concepts, tactics and strategies of battling.
“The zeal reaches its peak in the moment an adventure starts; it is a habit of mankind
to have even the tiniest hope for what they desire and easily avoid what they do not
like.”[8]

**Development of the Albanian military strategic concept 1961-1975**

This phase can be considered as the phase of develpment, improvement and perfection
of the establishment of AF and their military strategy. Psychology of Cold War,
elaborated for the first time by the well known American publicist Walter Lipman[9] was
based on the so-called theory of “ filed of zero sum”. According to this theory,
“Advantage of one pole of power meant disadvantage for other pole. Thus, both poles,
Soviet Union and USA started an unprecedented race of armament with each other,
with the final objective, weakening of the adversary and winning over it by no means.

Political divergences between Tirana and Moscow, attested in the Conference of 81
communist parties in 1960 in Moscow, brought about the first big crack between our
country and Soviet Union, consequently with Warsaw Treaty.

In this period, the party-state ideologists began to elaborate a new ideological, political
and military strategy, which covered all party and state levels, to adapt to the new
situation created, which just like all other components of life in the country strongly
influenced the Albanian Armed Forces. Armed Forces began to think about a new
concept of Defence of the territorial integrity of the country with those resources
that they possessed at that time. So we can say that here is the origin of the subsequent
strategic platform for the army.

After breaking off with the Warsaw Pact, the military-political situation changed
significantly and abruptly. The party-state at that time was trying to create a new
system of dogmas and principles, which would also serve as the “tracks” which our
country would follow in the future. As Albania remained without allies and was
under the threat of two powerful military blocks, solution was sought from within
the country, without denying the overwhelming desire of senior party leaders for
new alliances. And the solution was found very quickly: the principle of total reliance
_on our forces and internal resources._

The military experts also reacted immediately to create and develop new strategic
concepts, which would be the basis for the country’s defence directive from any
possible aggression from land, sea or air. The foundation of the theoretical thought
at that time was the development of the general concepts and tactics which would be
used in the battlefield, to be successful over every adversary no matter how much
prepared they were. Given the superiority of the enemy in forces and equipment and
the increase of devastating and demolishing power of their weapons in the battlefield;
the Albanian tactical thought sought for more efficient ways to minimize the losses
by ensuring the greatest possible protection of the personnel, equipment, weapons
and material stocks.

As important development of the concepts of this period, we can mention the
reassessment of the general tactics concept “tactical success led to operational and
_strategic success” or “The sum of tactical successes led to operational success,”_
_“the tactic for protection against air and sea desana”,_ _protection of the territory_
“inch by inch” _starting_ _from the state border”, etc._

After 60s reserves were assigned close to the units. Ready units were set up, units were
brought near combat duties, the security belt was created which until 1981 depended
from the Corps and later it would serve the First Echelon of the Infantry Brigade.

Distribution of active military in more than 1500 garrisons and 2800 supply points
formed the so-called popular way of organization from army barracks and near the
people. All this was part of the Albanian authenticity, where _problems of military_
_and defence were an integral part of every citizen. A special prominence at that time_
was given to the maintenance of the reserve at any cost, a principle that was
implemented in three levels: tactical, operational and strategic.

During the second stage of the organization of AF in 1960, which coincides with the
construction of the Armed Forces, second echelons were used as reserves. In tactical
units and garrisons the combined arms reserve was 25-33%. While within the AF the
combined arms reserve constituted 16%. There were also reserves for the kinds of
weapons and services. It was a characteristic that since the first period and steadily
the reserve kept increasing. In Ground Artillery, the reserve of the General Command,
which in the first period was 28 %, at the end of the second period amounted to 33%;
and in communication, chemistry and engineering it was even greater. While the
Navy and Air Force, as the Reserve of General Command increased greatly during
the second phase of construction of the AF. With the growth and expansion of the
Armed Forces during the third period of their construction (‘60 - ‘75), there was a
quite noticeable increase in reserves.

_The Albanian Military Strategic Thought, 1945-1991_

What were some of the essential differences between the Albanian military tactical
art and military art of war of the armies surrounding our country in some of the
typical indicators?

_First. Drastic changes in strategy and tactics. Albania was almost the only country in_
the world that had widely and practically included the strategy and tactics of partisan
warfare in its military art.

_Second. There were essential changes in the organization of the Armed Forces. The_
Albanian Army, like some other countries such as Israel, Switzerland, etc.,
experimented and materialized the theory of “people-soldier”.

_Third. Military ideologists in the early 60s and later after 1970 designed and required_
the implementation of the theory of fortification or to be more precise the tunnelling
theory.

After breaking off with the Soviet Union and our separation from the Warsaw Treaty,
the problem was how to ensure the defence of the country in the newly created
situation?

In such a situation there were also thoughts in regard to the country’s defence strategy,
which was raised for discussion. There were thoughts about the procession of the
military art, the structure of the army, for defence views and concepts, for armament
issues etc. At this time, around the year 1966, a “top secret” working paper drafted
by a group of senior officers of the Ministry of Defence, was titled by the communist
leadership of the time as the “skidding theory” and as an “anti-national theory”. In
order to put under control the concepts of superior military leaders that were against
the dictator, he came up with the Theses of the Council of Defence, which according
to Major General Ernest Jakova were “...A conglomerate of foreign military
_regulations, mixed with some concepts of our cadres ..., These theses were introduced_
_as their creative work, as an evolution for the army, in order to tell the Army that it_
_is us at the head and your senior officers are nothing if compared to political_
_leadership” The years ‘61-‘70 were the years of the theoretical processing and_
practical affirmation of the Albanian military thought materialized in the training
process, as well as in numerous regulations related to combat. During that time the
_attention was focused on:_

_First: The new political and ideological balances and our inexistence in Warsaw_
Treaty brought a new attitude and assessment by the political and state leadership of
the time regarding security and defence environment of the country and challenges
of the future. Albanian political and military leadership really assessed as possible
the turning of our territory into an arena of combat operations between the two blocks.
In such conditions they thought of the entire people engagement in the probable war
according to the slogan “Every citizen a soldier and every soldier a citizen”. The
rapid developments and independence of the Albanian Army, after the separation
from the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Treaty, forced the country’s military leadership
to be more responsible for their mission of country’s defence. With their sense of
duty to the country, military cadres did their best for the organization and preparation
of the “soldier people”.

_Col. PhD. Ahmet Leka_

_Second: Based on the concept “Defend the country inch by inch, from the edge of_
the border”, whole people were armed according to a clear protective platform to
fulfil the constitutional mission. With the intention to face a probable aggression, at
the core of the Albanian Army, was the “reserve army” “organized on the basis of
territory, under the concept “soldier people”. Units and garrisons appeared at military
basis and were ready for their duty at the regions where they lived near their protection
belts. Military training was conducted in the so-called “Free Schools”. Years ‘60-‘75
marked the time of expansion and construction of the Armed Forces, according to
the concept “all people soldier” and “finding the self”, formation of the original
independent tactical doctrinal concepts which were materialized with the emergence
of Thesis of the Council Defence. The processed Albanian doctrinal thought,
escalating from small tactics to operational and strategic concepts took shape and it
opened the way to the institutionalized scientific military thought.

_Third. Thesis of the Council of Defence as mindset and generalization of both Albanian_
and world experience adapted to the conditions and possibilities of our country started
to be tested immediately into practice in exercises with small tactical formations in
designated training areas and then in large scale exercises at corps level and beyond.
Training, experimental and generalizing progress, created a favourable terrain to
process the doctrinal concept for the strategy and tactics of the Armed Forces in all
structures, types of forces, services, ranging from soldier (volunteer) to the largest
tactical unit. About 212 tactical regulations, various texts and instructions were
processed, approved and put into use in the years ‘70-‘75.

_Fourth._ Building and perfection of AF was conceived and implemented in such a
way to involve people nationwide. The culmination was the sending of weapons
closer to the contingents, according to the principle of mobilization based on territory.
This system provided a tactical level rise across large contingents of reserves, or all
soldier people, as a guarantee to protect the country from the state border, leaving no
empty spaces for the potential enemy. During this time, recognizing the advantages
of our enemies, in coalition or separately, in technique, weaponry, and the demolishing
firing power, political and military command of the country focused its attention on
the fortification of the theatre of military operations including the battlefield.

_Fifth. At this stage of the development of the military, theoretical and practical thought_
of Albania, the way how offensive and defensive combat was assessed should be
underlined. As the main kind of combat was considered the offensive one, while the
defensive combat was considered as one of the main kinds of combat. It should be
stressed that the withdrawing combat was treated in various ways. This kind of combat
was very much conditioned in relevant regulations and was conducted only by special
order. It is not treated as a special type of combat, but simply as “a form of tactical
manoeuvre” only temporary and within the defence tactic framework. Military
theorists of the time considered tactical combat in its complexity, not only in terms
of military organization, the technical equipment and weaponry used in different
kinds of tactics, but also the types of combat. Defence combat, offensive combat,
withdrawing combat, combat while marching, chasing combat, combat in special
conditions, combat in dwelled areas, in forests, conducting offensive actions while
marching etc. and the fight against air and sea desana and other peculiarities of the

117


-----

_The Albanian Military Strategic Thought, 1945-1991_

Albanian tactics were widely treated in the combat regulations.

_Finally: We can say that the Albanian military thought held in mind and carefully_
considered the partisan war tactic, i.e. the mastery of fighting with partisan ways and
methods behind the rear lines of the enemy as part of the entire tactics.
**Development of new concepts and strategies in the years 1976-1991**

Deterioration and break of relations with
China, forced the leadership of that time
to multiply measures and attempts to fully
respond to the rapport of the international
political relations of our country with
other powers, as well as the country’s
defence needs.

The new situation laid as a basic task the
necessity of a strong and sure defence in
the main operational and operationalstrategic directions, particularly in the
northern, north-eastern and coastal areas. Alongside with the existing effective units
and detachments, machine gun units were set up in the visible areas of air desana and
they were mainly composed of regular forces.

In general, fortification gained an unprecedented prominence. Strategic concept of
fortification was conceived as an idea to fortify the regions of military tasks, initially
the first echelons and further deep in the country, and around 1980 started the
fortification of the whole country which meant fortification even of the areas between
the location of the unit that in a combat situation could be occupied by the reserve
units of the General Command according to the operational and strategic directions.

There has been a lot of noise and speculation about the number of bunkers; hence it
is necessary to remind that there were guiding norms. Thus, at the beginning the aim
was to ensure a firing centre (bunker) for the squad (for its machine gun) and later
the plan passed on garrison system with 2,3 and 5 such firing centres. On these basis
the directive was that an infantry battalion should have 140-170 firing centres, while
a machine gun battalion around 250. The cost of a firing centre was supposed to be
250 000 to 300 000 Albanian lek (old currency), so the expenditure for the construction
of all bunkers was 225 billion lek (old currency). One of the protagonists of
fortification like Alfred Moisiu in his book of recollections on his military life states
that: “In Albania, from 1945 to 1985 there were built 250-300 thousand bunkers of
_all types”, but the recent research shows that their approximate number is 176_
thousand[10].

_Budget: According to the “Annual Statistical Book of Albania”, published in 1991_
by the Department of Statistics at the Ministry of Economy and exactly the income
and expenditure of the state budget, in the chapter “Finance, Banking, Insurance”,
we learn that for defence the country spent 9.6 % of the state budget in 1975, in 1980

10 Major General Prof.PhD Kostaq Karoli Gazeta “Shekulli”, date 17.10.2013.

_Col. PhD. Ahmet Leka_

this figure was 11.8 % of the budget, in 1985 it was 11.4 % and in 1990 it was 8.1 %
of the state budget. So, military expenditures for the period 1975 onwards, made up
10-11 % of the state budget. This was a heavy burden for the Albanian economy,
which was either progressing very slowly, or not progressing at all.

What were some of the most typical features of the development of military strategic
concept, of the doctrinal and organizational thought AF for that period?

Organization of the whole the people to defend the country. This organization ensured
a broad participation of the masses in defence issues, training and their all round
military preparation, rapid mobilization and simultaneous protection of all possible
directions from enemy attack.

_Independence._ Units and garrisons were organized in such a way that with their
manpower and means they could carry out tasks by being autonomous during combat
operations. This organization did not exclude mutual cooperation and coordination
between the military actions of our forces.

_Providing high level of manoeuvre. Successful accomplishment of the combat task_
forces by organic forces and equipments is closely related to the need to have a high
level of manoeuvre in the battlefield, in order to cope with situations that arise.
Subunits and units should not necessarily connect their mobility with a road. Very
important for the increase of the level of manoeuvre was animal or shoulder
transportation.

_Creation of reserves. To cope with the circumstances that could be created in times_
of war, division command in defence operation usually held in the second echelon or
reserve one third to two fifths of infantry and tank units that depended on it; while in
assault the operational structuring was made at least in two echelons. The command
of the infantry brigade in defence combat kept in its second echelon or reserve 1/3 up
to 1/2 of infantry units. Great importance was given for wartime reserves of the
General Command.

_The Albanian Military Strategic Thought, 1945-1991_

_Providing all kinds of forces, weapons and services, in right proportion with each other._
War in general, requires different types of armed forces, weapons and services. The
success of every kind of operation is achieved through mutual interaction among them.

_Mobilization, rapid and organized opening of the Armed Forces. Mobilization and_
opening system in the regions of combat tasks ensured the reporting, arming,
equipping, getting the military task and going to defence positions in a quick and
organized way. For this purpose all military structures carried out call to arm tests
along with reserve structures, in order to get the positions in time.

Under the Cold War psychosis and in accordance with the political concept of the time
and self-isolation, the Albanian army increased immensely. So until the early 90s,
only the army, surpassing even the ratio applied by the Warsaw Treaty, had 61.000
military people in uniform or over 2 % of the population, 360.000 reservists and over
200.000 territorial volunteers, without mentioning the mobilization of the armed youth
of high schools and universities. While in accordance with the main principles of the
protection of the country “inch by inch”, the army left its barracks and located in
nearly 2.200 armouries across the country. Starting from 1975 the army had the most
extensive capabilities of the Albanian military history up to that time.

**Conclusions**

-  Historical logic of “traditional Albanian resistance to survive” has defined
and influenced to a large extent on the development of the “original” Albanian
military art.

-  Development of defence strategy of Republic of Albania is always related
with the security environment in the region and beyond.

-  As a small country Albania should always rely on alliances, be they regional
or European programs and initiatives or beyond.

-  Elaboration of the Albanian strategic concept and military thought has been
conducted at any time in full agreement with a certain political and ideological
pillar. Opposing ideas often have brought about bad consequences to their
bearers (1974) and this shows that politics has always influenced the military
field.

-  Viewing the moral, physical and conceptual aspects the Albanian Army was
coherent and able to fight.

-  Until ’66, the Albanian strategy and military thought was entirely based on
viewpoints, concepts and principles of Russian military art. The focus at
this time was on the issues of organization, structuring and modernization of
the Albanian Army.

-  Defence strategic concept and doctrinal thought started to be shaped after
’70-ies (the establishment of the Institute of Military Studies), as “authentic”
Albanian, enabling the compilation of the Popular Military Art (PMA) in
1975 and later in 1985.

-  The principle of “independence”, i.e. “the principle of self-reliance” led to
economic collapse, stopping the development of weapons technology and
technique and consequently weakening the country’s defence strategy.

-  The approval of the new Strategic Concept (NATO Summit in Rome,
November 1991), was a decisive step for a new institutionalized cooperation
in defence and security issues for the Republic of Albania.

-  After the Cold War, the nature of the Armed Forces and their use for political
purposes changed radically. The prospect of major conventional war between
industrially developed countries had already become meaningless. Military
structures, organization and development of doctrinal concepts of the Armed
Forces, the definition of their long-term development, modernization and
transformation strategies, were conducted in full compliance with the
requirements of the time.

_Financing of Terrorism-Case study, Albania_


##### Financing of Terrorism-Case study, Albania

Col. PhD. Eduart Bala

Deputy Director of Defence Intelligence Agency

**Short commentary.** _In Albania, radical and militant Islamic groups have proliferated_
_since the fall of communism. The case presented here is an example of how the_
_ideology of radical Islam is spread in various places by Islamic non-governmental_
_organizations (NGOs) and how weak states have become fertile recruiting grounds_
_and safe havens for Islamic militants. Using the case study Albania, this paper_
_describes the relationships and cooperation between Al Qaeda, other international_
_terrorist organizations, Islamic NGOs, and Islamic legal businesses in Albania, and_
_how the Albania government has responded to this activity. First, it provides brief_
_overview of Albania setting at the begging of the post communist period, followed by_
_a description of the various Islamic NGOs emerging in this period and their_
_involvement in support of terrorist activities in the country, and concludes with a_
_discussion of how the Albanian government has reacted to this threat._

**Overview**

fter the fall of communism in the early 1990s, Albania has gone through
political, economic, legal and social changes. The country was in poor
economic condition, had a high rate of unemployment, weak rule of law, and

# Awas exploited by Islamic NGOs related to terrorist organizations. Those NGO’s gained

the cover of legitimacy by claiming their mission was one of charity and spreading
Islam. In fact, their aim was to promote Islamic radicalism and to use Albania as a
safe haven for their operations.

There were several facilitating factors which made Albania a welcoming place for
these Islamic NGOs and affiliated terrorist groups that allowed them to make use of
the relevant conditions and location to build a wide logistic base for financing and
supporting their activities. Among these factors are: Albania’s geography, its mix of
religions, its poor economic conditions, and the weakness of its legal system and
government agencies.

First, the location of Albania in the Balkan region of Eastern Europe allows an easy
flow to Western European countries. This has been exploited by organized crime
groups for human trafficking and smuggling drugs, weapons, etc. For example, the

distance between the Albanian city of Valona and the Italian city of Bari is 35 miles
which can be covered within an hour using the speedy boat.[1]

Second, the majority of the population of Albania is Muslim. Much of the Albanian
Islamic community welcomed the Islamic NGOs, which allowed them to gradually
influence the faith of this community and push it towards extremism and radicalism.
This turn to a more radical version of Islam is part of a broader movement of Islamic
revivalism in Albania.

Islam in Albania dates from the time of the arrival of the Ottomans during the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.[2] At the independence of the country in November
1912, Albania was 50% Sunni Muslim, 20% Bektashi Muslims (Shiia), 20% Roman
Catholic, and 10% Orthodox Christian. During the period 1924-1933, King Zog I
established Albania as a secular kingdom and forced Muslims congregations to end
their relations with Istanbul after 1921. The Sunni elected the mufti with his residence
in Tirana, together with the High Council of Shariah. Meanwhile, the Shiia (Bektashi)
community was banned in Turkey in 1925, moved its world centre to Tirana, and
was officially recognized as a separate community upon a decree issued in 1925.[3]

After the liberation from the nazi-facsist occupation that lasted from 1939-1944,
Albania was ruled as a totalitarian communist regime for more than 46 years by
Enver Hoxha,[4] a xenophobic Communist leader who turned the country into the
most isolated place in Europe.[5] The distaste for religion was strongly promoted by
the Communist ideology, which saw religion as a conservative custom and an obstacle
to the socialist “Cultural Revolution.” The communists’ final blow against religion
came in 1967 with the banning of any religious practices and literature; for about 25
years the Albania was the only declared atheist country in the world.[6]

The rebirth of religion in Albania was not affiliated only with the Islam but with all
religions, including Roman Catholic and Orthodox Catholic groups. Religious
tolerance was a precondition for being a democratic society and for joining European
society.[7] Freedom of religion was one of the main issues in the transition period for
the ex-communist countries of East Europe and especially for Albania. Therefore,
the ban on religious practices came to an end, resulting in a gradual revival of religious
practice, together with the restoration and rebuilding of religious institutions.

The third factor making Albania especially attractive to Islamic NGOs and terrorist
groups was the poor economic condition that many Albanian families were

experiencing, particularly in rural areas. Unlike the other religious groups that flocked
to Albania during this period, the Islamic charities and businesses claimed their intent
was to foster the economy of Albania. [8]

Fourth, the gaps in and lack of legal infrastructure in post communist Albania also
made the country particularly attractive to Islamic charity foundations. The new
democratic system which came into power after the communist regime was legally
and politically weak and had many other problems, such as widespread corruption,
porous borders, and a reluctance to rigorously scrutinize foreign investment and
foreign companies, especially Islamic NGOs operating within Albania.[9] Additionally,
Albanian officials and agencies lacked the experience and skills, which made it
difficult for the intelligence and law enforcement agencies to monitor the activity of
these Islamic charity NGOs and extremist groups and individuals coming into the
country and working in and for these charity foundations.
**Islamic humanitarian organizations and charities**

Within this operational context, many radical Islamic organizations and affiliated
NGOs moved into Albania to use it as a safe haven, recruiting ground, and logistical
base. As we have seen elsewhere, one of the sources of terrorism financing is through
charities, where the inadvertent or intentional diversion of funds finances terror instead
of benevolent activities. The Islamic charities collect millions of dollars every year.
The majority of this funding is used for benevolent causes, such as building mosques
and Islamic centres, educating and helping the poor, and selecting and sponsoring
young Albanians and sending them to study in Islamic countries. Some of the funds,
unfortunately, are diverted to terrorists, either by design or through the exploitation
of otherwise legitimate organizations.

In the case of supporting and financing terrorist activities, terrorist organizations
such as al-Qaeada, Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ), Algerian Islamic Salvation Front
(FIS) and Islamic Armed Islamic Group (GIA), used the cover of NGOs and charities
to raise and distribute funds.

These extremist organizations managed to infiltrate their people into the organizations
and manipulated their activities by: (1) controlling the funds and using them for their
terrorist activities; (2) using the advantages provided by the legitimate status of these
organizations; (3) using the cover of Islam to polarize and radicalize young Albanians
and to bring them into the political extremist movements against the Albanian
government and its institutions; (4) conducting an effective propaganda and
recruitment role through their offices, schools, cultural centres, newspapers,
magazines, and videotapes to disseminate their Wahhabi and Salafi extremist ideology;
(5) using Albania as a bridge to promote their terrorist activities and operations abroad,
especially in other Balkan countries (Bosnia and Kosovo), Afghanistan, Iraq, and
Europe.[10] The following is a description of some of the Islamic NGOs that have been

working in Albania and how they have been used for terrorist purposes. Much of the
information is based on the author’s professional experience dealing with these
organizations.

The International Humanitarian Islamic Organization (IIRO) is the first Islamic NGO
that was established in Albania in the beginning of 1990 when the new democratic
government allowed freedom of religion. This foundation is a Wahhabi organization
and is sponsored and supported by Saudi Arabia.[11] This NGO had supported AlQaeda and their terrorist activities around the globe.[12] The IIRO has been the main
umbrella for the other Islamic NGOs that later came to Albania and during the first
period of its activity played an important role in helping the mujahedeen in Bosnia
with money and logistics.[13] It also supported al-Qaeda and other terrorist organization
such as the GIA and FIS.[14] Muhammad al Zawahiri, the brother of Bin Laden’s deputy,
Ayman al-Zawahiri, was employed by the Albanian office of IIRO where he assisted
al-Qaeda’s efforts in the Balkans.[15] During the Kosovo crisis (1999-2000), this
organization played an active role in supporting Kosovo refugees in Albania and
Kosovo.[16] However, the main aim was to establish the Wahhabi theology in Kosovo’s
Muslim community and later to create the possibility for mujahedeen and terrorist
activities.[17]

The Al Haramain Association,[18] an Islamic charity, based in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia,
was established in Albania in 1992. From the beginning, the Al Haramain Association
was active in building the Wahhabi mosques around the country,[19] opening the Islamic
cultural centres, supporting orphans and poor families by helping the children attend
Wahhabi theological schools in Saudi Arabia. It has been one of the most active
Islamic NGO in Albania in indoctrinating the young Albanian imams with Salafi
ideology and has provided them with financial help. Also this charity has provided
financial and logistic support for the mujahedeen in Bosnia (mujahedeen battalion
in Zenica) and Chechnya.[20] From 1993 until 1998, the Al Haramain Albanian branch
had been penetrated by Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) members associated with alQaeda. The mission of the EIJ cell in Albania was to create many sub-cells by
recruiting young Albanians, training them in forging documents, and preparing them

in terrorist activities and acts of violence in Kosovo to further to destabilize the
internal situation in Albania by fomenting conflict among the different religious
groups in the country.[21] The head of EIJ’s Albanian cell, Ahmed Ibrahim al-Nagar,
a.k.a Mohamed Ragab Foudah, worked as head of the office, while Mohamed Hasan
Mahmoud Hassan, a.k.a Abu Omar, used to be the director of the foundation. After
they were arrested and deported to Egypt, the Al Haramain headquarters decided to
continue to support the branch but they assigned young Muslim Albanian extremists
to lead it. From 1999 until 2005 (when this NGO in Albania was declared closed by
the Albania government), it was led by young Wahhabi and Salafi former students
who were trained in Saudi Arabia.[22]

The Revival of Islamic Heritage Society (RIHS) is an Islamic NGO which is sponsored
by the Muslim Brotherhood Organization in Kuwait and opened an office in Tirana
in 1992. Just as with Al Haramain, from1993 until the end of 1998 the Revival of
Islamic Heritage Foundation was penetrated by EIJ and al-Qaeda. Specifically, it
was taken over by several operatives, including Ahmed Ismail Othman Saleh, a.k.a.
Abu Anas, who lived in Albania with a false Sudanese passport under the name of
Mohammed Khaled Ahmed Moussa, and who used to work as the representative of
this NGO in the urban areas where he was devoted to recruiting the young Albanian
students to Wahhabi and Salafi ideology. He was arrested in an attempt to escape
from Albania and during the arrest the police found a blueprint of the U.S. embassy
in Albania made by him.[23] Also involved was Mosbah Ali Hassannein Azab, a.k.a.
Saif or Abdel Rahman, a Yemeni national who lived with a false passport under the
name of Fahd Ali Saleh. He was the head of the NGO for North Albania. When the
police forces tried to arrest him, he escaped to Montenegro and from there moved to
Milan with the help of the organised crime groups involved in human smuggling
and were subsequently arrested.[24] The final operative from EIJ/AQ to penetrate this
NGO was Hossam Ezzat Hossam Nour El Din, a.k.a. Alaa, who used an Egyptian
passport under the name Salah Mohammed Omar el Sayed. He was killed during a
confrontation with police forces.[25] The other EIJ members were arrested and deported
to their countries of origin in 1998. In 2005, the Revival of Islamic Heritage NGO
was closed by the Albanian government. The young Albanian Islamic extremists
that had been recruited and trained by it reopened it, but this time under a different
name, “Call for Wisdom.” This young Albanian Salafi group was financed illegally
by the RIHS headquarter in Kuwait, until the police shut it down.[26]

The Muwafaq Foundation (or Blessed Relief Foundation) was established in Albania
in 1993 as an Islamic charity. This NGO was sponsored by Yassin Abdullah al-Qadi
who is on a list of 39 individuals and groups accused by the United States Treasury

Department of financing Osama bin Laden and his organization, al-Qaeda.[27] This
foundation was very active during the Bosnia war by supporting the mujahidin and
Kosovo refugees in Albania.[28] In 1994 the Albanian office of the Muwafaq Foundation
was visited by Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, one of Osama bin Laden’s brother-inlaws with deep roots in al-Qaeda as a financier.[29] Al-Qadi closed the Muwafaq
Foundation in 1998 following reports of its ties to terrorism.[30] He changed the
destination of the investments from charities to businesses. He opened several business
including a sugar importing business, a medical enterprise, and a construction
business, as well as a number of commercial companies called “Medicare”, “Loxhall”,
“Karavan”, “Alintid Beton”, “Albanian Snacks”, “Loks Holl”, “Cavallo”, “Waleed
for general Trade”, “Emane” and “Kambel.”[31] The Albanian government then closed
the activities of these companies and froze the investments. They were closed not
only because they were connected with him and al-Qaeda, but also because they
were fictitious companies with limited commercial activity.[32]

The Project of Benefaction of the Gulf Foundation was established in Albania in
1997. This is a Kuwaiti NGO financed and sponsored by Kuwaiti Brotherhood
extremists. The founder and director of the foundation was Dr. Abdul Latif Saleh.
Saleh was born a Palestinian and has Jordanian citizenship. He was the first director
of Al Haramain and the first Arab to take Albanian citizenship. Saleh is closely
associated with a number of NGOs in Albania with links to the Egyptian Islamic
Jihad. In 2000, Albanian authorities expelled Dr Abdyl Latif Saleh from Albania on
suspicion of membership in a “radical Islamic Jihad group”,[33] and for closely
associating with Osama bin Laden, who provided Saleh with $600,000 to encourage
the establishment of extremist groups in Albania.[34]

The World Assembly of Muslim Youth (WAMY) has its centre in Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia and is financed by the Saudi King. “WAMY was co-founded by Kamal
Helwabi, a former senior member of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood and by Osama
bin Laden’s nephew Abdullah bin Laden (who served as WAMY’s President through
2002 and is now its Treasurer).”[35] This foundation is active worldwide and the WAMY
branch in Albania was registered as a legal organization on November 1, 1993 with
the aim to construct mosques and provide humanitarian aid. This charity was active

in bringing to Albania the Wahhabi and Salafi ideology and in recruiting and sending
the Albanian students to Saudi Arabia for study in madrassas or other schools where
they learn only Wahhabi and Salafi theology. After the raid by police forces in1999
and the deportation of the suspected terrorist elements from Albania, the WAMY
sponsors in Saudi Arabia continued and still continue to support the new Albanian
leaders of the WAMY Albanian branch with money and propaganda material.

The Islamic Relief Foundation was registered as a legal organization in Albania
court on December 12, 1991. Like the other Islamic charities, it engages in
humanitarian activities like providing aid for poor people and orphans, building
mosques, and spreading religious propaganda. In reality, however, its activity was
used as a base for Islamic extremists and especially for the members of the Algerian
Front of Islamic Salvation (FIS) and its armed branch, the GIA, to hide from Algerian
forces. For instance, Qamar-el-din Kharban, a former officer in the Algerian army
and a senior Arab mujahidin commander in Afghanistan, was a cofounder and a key
leader in FIS. He stayed for a year in Albania and afterwards went to Bosnia, while
other member of the FIS, like Adnan I. Habib and Grinat Belhout, also Algerian
nationalists, came to Albania at the beginning of 1993 and were deported in 1999
after special operations from law enforcement.[36]

Taibah International was an Islamic organization headquartered in and sponsored by
Saudi Arabia. The Albania office was established in 1993. Its espoused mission was
to support poor Albanian families and orphans, and to build schools. However, Taibah
International was penetrated by extremist Islamic members of the Egyptian
Brotherhood. They opened one school in Tirana, called Drita (or “The Light”), which
was in reality a class for boys under fifteen where they learned Islam, especially
Wahhabism and Salafi theology. The other school was in North Albania and was
called “Abu Hanife Insitute.” Students of this “institute” were under the leadership
of the Egyptian extremists and instigated violent conflicts with the members of other
religions (Christians and Shiia Muslims), not only in the areas where they studied,
but after their graduation in the places where they went to live and promote Islam.
After 2005 when the police forces shut down this organization,[37] this foundation
changed its name to the Albanian name “Jeta” translated in English as “The Life.”
The new managers of this Islamic NGO were young Albanian extremists students of
the Taibah schools and were supported by the same headquarters. As a result of this
connection to the original Taibah International NGO, the government also closed
down this new organization.[38]

Al Waqf al Islamia was established in 1992 in Albania. Sponsored by Saudi Arabia,
the headquarters is in the Netherlands. It has been penetrated by extremist elements
of the EIJ and al-Qaeda. Al Waqf has built madrassas in the Albanian cities of Berati
and Gjirokaster and its aim was to recruit young people into the ideology of extremist

Islam. This foundation has closed its activity in Albania, but still exists in Kosovo.[39]

The Qatari Charitable Society was based in Doha and it was financed and supported
by the Emirs of Qatar. The office in Albania was established in 1993. Its activities
have been fairly limited, but it has sponsored and supported the mujahedin in Bosnia
during the Bosnia war.[40]

The Joint Saudi Committee for Kosovo was established in 1999 in Albania with the
main aim to build a terrorist network in Kosovo during the Kosovo War. It was
sponsored by the Saudis, Osama bin Laden, and al-Qaeda affiliates. This NGO took
the leading role among all the Saudi NGOs in Kosovo (IIRO, Al-Haramain, WAMY,
Al Waqf al Islamia). The director, Wael Hamza Julaidan, and secretary, Abdal Sadek
Kathum, were also representatives of the Rabita Trust Company in Albania. In 2000
both of them were declared “persona non grata” because they had Saudi Arabia
diplomatic passports and were deported from Albania, and the NGO was closed.[41]

Global Relief Foundation (a.k.a Fondation Secours Mondial) is headquartered in
Brussels, Belgium and had an office in Albania. Its officers and directors have
connections to, and have provided support for and assistance to, Osama bin Laden,
the al-Qaeda network and the Taliban.[42] The bank accounts belonging to the Lebanese
national Nabil Abdul Salam Sayadi, a member of this organization, were frozen by
the Albanian government upon an order issued on 10 March 2005.[43]

The Islamic World Committee is sponsored by Muslim Brotherhood extremists in
Kuwait and it was established in Albania in 1993. The foundation was penetrated by
extremist elements of Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. The foundation has been used
as an umbrella for the extremists Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood members who left
the Egypt and were looking to enter clandestinely in Europe.[44]

The Kuwait Joint Relief Committee for Charity, (KJRC) has its headquarters in Kuwait
and in it are included some humanitarian associations such as the International Islamic
Charitable Organization and House of Zekat. In Albania this foundation has been
active since 1993. The funds for this foundation come from assistance from Kuwait
and from selling books and magazines that promote the Wahhabi and Salafi theology.
Within this organization is the institute called El Hagri in Elbasan, Albania, where
young Albanian students learn the extremist Wahhabi and Salafi theology. During
the Kosovo war the foundation opened a branch in Kosovo. Overall, this foundation

is reducing its activity in Albania and is going to transfer its main focus to Kosovo.[45]

There were also several small Islamic NGO which were not very active and did not
openly support terrorists but they have played a significant role in spreading the
Wahhabi and Salafi theology among the young Albanians, helping them with money
to attend Wahhabi and Salafi schools and courses in countries as Sudan, Pakistan,
Saudi Arabia and Libya.

**Counterterrorism policies of the Albanian Government**

Originally, Albania lacked a counterterrorism strategy or even the organizational
structures for countering terrorism. Over time, however, the Albanian government
has responded to this threat in various ways and with varying degrees of success.
One task critical to any success is to identify the role of the Islamic NGOs in supporting
and financing the terrorist activities of al-Qaeda and other groups.[46] Since the late
1990s, Albania has taken many steps to identify these NGOs and curtail their activities.

In 1998 the new Albanian political leadership that came into power after the 1997
crisis, clearly understood the perils of the passive policy against terrorism. The new
policy that the government started was also encouraged by international actors, and
in particular, U.S. intelligence services, which in cooperation with the Albanian secret
services, and police, marked the change in the official counter-terrorism policy. As a
result of this cooperation during 1998 and 1999, a number of suspected international
terrorists were arrested and extradited from Albania, and a number of NGOs came
under the scrutiny of the law.

Moreover, in the aftermath of September 11, 2001 some international media outlets
and neighbouring governments portrayed Albania as a haven of terrorism and made
allegations of links between ethnic Albanian insurgents and Islamic terrorism.
However, the Albanian government worked to demonstrate its commitment to fighting
terrorism. In close cooperation with different westerns partners, including the U.S.,
U.K., France, Italy, and Germany, a number of raids were launched against Islamic
NGOs that used to be the bases for the terrorists. A number of their principal officers
were deported and, in the meantime, the government revoked visa privileges to the
Arab nationals suspected of terrorist or extremist activities. Criminal processes against
terrorist finances were also initiated.

The identification of the existence of money laundering, a large informal sector, a
cash economy, coupled with a fragile financial system in Albania, which led NGO-s
and the terrorist elements to bring many in cash or electronic wire transfers pushed
the Albanian government to take some radical measurement to bring it under control.
So, the government suggested amendments to the existing legal framework related
to terrorism and terrorist financing and came up with a new law in 2004 to upgrade
the national infrastructure on the fight against terrorism, titled “The Law on Prevention
of Money Laundering and Financing of International Terrorism.” [47] The law is the

necessary legal basis for the fight economic informality (informal cash-based
transactions), money laundering and the financing of terrorism, in accordance with
the directive and other international standards in this field New entities were
established, like Directorate General Prevention of Money Laundering which is the
Financial Intelligence Unit, governmental interagency cooperation became more
flexible, and additional training was provided on the job to the newly hired and
existing personnel.[48]

In the framework of the implementation of the U.N. Security Council resolutions,
the government of Albania took up action to freeze/sequester the assets and bank
accounts belonging to individuals enlisted in the “Consolidated List”, like the Saudi
national Yassin al-Qadi,[49] Palestinian-Jordanian Abdul Latif Saleh,[50] and Belgian
nationals Nabil Abdul Salam Sayadi and Patricia Rosa Vinck (both of Global Relief
Foundation). Foreign Islamic NGOs were shut down; assets and bank accounts
belonging to the following groups were frozen: Al-Haramein, Global Relief
Foundation, Taibah International, and Revival of Islamic Heritage Society. The
Albanian Government has frozen around $20 million in total.[51] The Albanian
government is doing its best to ensure that its actions targeting international terrorism
and terrorist financing are consistent with international laws and with the norms of
liberal democracy.
**Conclusion**

The experience of al-Qaeda and other international terrorist organizations associated
with it show how non-state actors and global networks can support and finance terrorist
activities. In the Albanian case, NGOs used the country to build their operations, to
raise money to support mujahedin, to recruit new Albanian radicals, to gain legal
cover for their operations, and to serve as a springboard for their operations in Europe.
Some terrorists have already infiltrated other parts of Europe from bases in Albania
through the traffic of illegal immigrants by speedboats across the Adriatic Sea to
Italy.

Also, this case shows how NGOs adapt their operations as circumstances dictate.
They changed their leadership from Arab citizens to the young Albanian students
recruited by them after the Arab leaders were arrested and/or deported; they changed
the name of the NGOs from Arabic to Albanian; and in the case of al-Qadi, we saw
how he closed the NGO and transferred the money to different shadow businesses.
Also, a large number of the personnel of these NGOs got married with Albanian girls

to become citizens, or used fake identities to make them hard to be reached or
identified.

The experience gained from this case highlights the need to not only freeze and seize
the terrorist-linked assets, but also to detect and follow them as the best way to stop
and disrupt their criminal actions in Albania and beyond as part of a global effort
against terrorism.

##### “A Defence Planning System for Albania under the NATO
 Collective Defence”

Colonel (R) Thimi Hudhra

Deputy Director, National Centre for Security and Defence, MoD

**Short commentary.** _The Defence Planning System under the NATO Collective_
_Defence is one of the major current subjects under discussions in the agenda of the_
_national defence and security institutions of the country, closely connected with the_
_great historic event of four years ago, in April, 2009: Albania’s membership in the_
_North Atlantic Alliance._

_The fulfilment of the strategic goal of membership in the Alliance is not the end of_
_our efforts. This does not mean that the integration process is closed. In this context,_
_the key question of my motivation in this topic is how to become respected members_
_of the Alliance, with both the benefits and the obligations stemming from the_
_membership. This quality transformation of the country defence concept will be_
_associated with complex reforms in the security and defence._


he object of this paper is to analyze what has changed since the day of our
country’s membership in the NATO summit of Strasbourg-Kehl, and to identify
what needs to be further changed ahead until full integration into the Alliance.

# TIn other words, what has changed from Albania’s “de jure” membership and what is

expected to be changed until full “de facto” integration?

In my view, there is a significant difference between the definition of membership
and that of integration. In addition to things in common, these two notions cannot be
fully identified with each other. While “de jure” membership relates to the accession
date of our country in the Alliance, the “de facto” integration is a longer process
associated with a sustainable progress in the political, economic, financial and military
areas of the allied country, in order for it to normally exercise both benefits and
contributions of collective security and defence, which are not necessarily achieved
in the accession day.

My purpose has less to do with the progress achieved during the pre-accession period
and more with the challenges ahead. It has to do with the development of a strategic

_“A Defence Planning System under the NATO Collective Defence”_

planning system to ensure the security and defence of the Republic of Albania, now
as a member of the Euro-Atlantic Alliance and part of the collective defence.

Through the “lessons learned” approach of our country and other countries in this
period, I tried to give answers to questions in the agenda of reforms of state security
institutions, and particularly the Ministry of Defence and General Staff, such as:
What are the changes required by the membership in the Alliance? Beyond the “de
jure” membership, which are some of further “de facto” integration challenges? What
are the benefits and obligations in the defence planning area? What should be the
Level of Ambition of our country in NATO? What authority should be delegated to
collective defence planning, and what contribution should be produced for collective
defence? How much military forces are now enough for our country to accomplish
the constitutional mission as a NATO ally? Can we get rid of the development of the
armed forces as sometimes claimed by some sceptical and nihilistic views? If not,
what are some of the main characteristics of the future force compared with the
traditional one? How could they differ in size and quality from the current armed
forces? What recommendations can be given in support of the capability priorities
developed by the NATO Strategic Concept? What is the current system of national
defence planning and how can it be further harmonized with the collective defence
system? What are those elements that can measure such a thing? What civilian
capabilities are needed to be together alongside the military ones? What are the
mechanisms and structures to be used for the harmonization of our national defence
planning system with that of the Alliance? Why should we be active in this process?
The above questions are only some of the total bunch of questions ahead.

In my opinion, Albania is lucky to be a NATO member, at a time when the Alliance
itself is going through a period of transformation. Its Strategic Concept 2010 and
Lisbon Critical Capability Package, together with the “Smart Defence” package of
projects of Chicago Summit in 2012, have given transformation messages for all
allied countries for the ten coming years. With this in mind, the transformation of the
Alliance is and will be conducted by each allied country through the long-term
planning or the NATO Defence Planning Process (NDPP). Albania cannot be excluded
from this process.

I believe that this qualitative change in the defence policy of our country cannot be
easily completed; it requires knowledge, expertise, and professional engagement.
Alliance is a giant mechanism of collective security and defence, with a history of
over 60 years, with known and unknown paths and labyrinths, with unclassified and
classified information, and under continuous transformation. Collective defence
mechanisms are complex, very complicated and moving often with difficulties. In
this sense, the transition from superficial understanding to deep knowledge of the
Alliance’s collective defence remains a fundamental issue for us. It is time now to
develop our policies, articulate our positions, and formulate our approaches on various
issues of the collective defence agenda.

Also, this paper has resulted in the conclusion that, in order to build a national strategic
defence planning system in harmony with the Alliance, we need to develop a strategic
planning community of experts, which requires a period of at least 5 years. The

_Col R Thimi Hudhra_

Integration Conference Report, Albania-NATO 2011 stated that “...Albania’s National
_Defence Planning System should be aligned with NATO Collective Defence Planning_
_Process (NDPP). Decision-makers lack the knowledge of NDPP, and there are few_
_national experts in the NDPP area. The modification of the defence planning process_
_of RA should be taken into consideration... as well as training of experts in this_
_field”._

Four year later, we have the Final Integration Conference, where the new Albanian
Minister of Defence stated again that, and I quote: “the priority areas for the Ministry
_of Defence in the short term ahead are: first, the harmonization of the national_
_defence planning process with NATO collective defence planning process; second,_
_increase of interoperability with allied forces; third, maintaining of acceptable levels_
_of defence budgets to meet national and international obligations; and fourth,_
_contribution to regional security and stability”[1]._

To support this goal, the author has taught about 48 classes each year since 2010,
with the Senior Officer Courses of the Academy of Defence, which have shown both
positive interest of the attendees and contributed to the gradual development of this
strategic defence planning “pool of experts”.

The current defence planning system of our country under the collective defence
system is still under development. With findings and recommendations, I consider
myself part of its development, both the strength and weaknesses. However, this
system is undergoing significant improvements to reflect the new reality of collective
defence. One of the central conclusions is the fact that, in order to enjoy all the
benefits of collective defence planning system, Albania should continue to harmonize
timelines, processes, methodologies, documentation, disciplines, capacities, systems
and main end-products of the Alliance collective defence. This still remains a major
challenge for the post-accession period in the Alliance, which is being successfully
managed, but also associated with many difficulties since 2010, assisted by NATO
Strategic Commands, through Annual Integration Conferences.

Through facts, arguments, analysis and perspective views, I have drawn the conclusion
that the period 2013-2020 will continue to be a period of reforms and transformation
of Albania and AAF to meet NATO and EU standards. It will be a hard process, but
not unknown. Since 1999, eight new NATO member countries have followed this
process, so together the original values and characteristics which should show, we
should also benefit from the lessons learned and best practices of NATO member
countries in the past 20 years. The current practice of the period from membership to
integration of new member states after 1999 has extended and continues to extend
from 5 to 10 years from the date of their accession, which means that our country
will continue this process at least until 2015. Also, five more years will be required
for the consolidation of our country as an ally country, by 2020[2]. This period also
coincides with the national efforts to join the EU. This makes the study even more

interesting, especially for the obligations of the Ministry of Defence; to meet
simultaneously the criteria of the equation of full NATO integration and EU membership.

Although this subject is of primary interest for specialists and leaders at strategic level,
I have tried to make it simple for the military experts of military operational and tactical
level, as well as for civilian specialists in the area of civil protection planning.

I have specifically addressed the Defence Planning theory during the Cold War and
especially after the Cold War. Through introduction of a comparative study method,
I have identified the differences between the Defence Planning, the Force Planning
and Operational Planning. Further, I have described main classic/traditional and
modern methods of Defence Planning. Key focus is given to the Capability Based
Planning method (CBP) as the most modern planning method of the 21[st] century. I
have then reviewed the methodology and process of Long Term Defence Planning.
Although this chapter is characterized more by theory, it is illustrated with many
practical examples of Defence Planning in the twentieth century, and this century.
My purpose is that, after a detailed explanation of the theoretical foundations of the
Strategic Defence Planning, this chapter will normally bring the reader to the next
chapters, dealing with the collective defence planning, and the defence planning in
the Republic of Albania as part of collective defence. I think this approach makes the
paper more understandable and logical in its reading.

I have addressed the NATO collective defence planning, analyzed key Disciplines of
Defence Planning together with their related Authorities. Further, I have provided a
synthesis of the Defence Planning Capability Survey (NATO-DPCS), and described
the concept of Level of Ambition of the Alliance. Also, the chapter is further focused
on NATO types of missions, Collective Defence Planning scenarios, Essential
Operational Capabilities (EOC), NATO Task List document (NTL), and Capability
Codes and Statements. I have also explained the Types, Categories and Readiness
Levels of the Alliance Forces, as well as the methodology of transition from the
Defence Planning to Operations Planning in NATO. All this information, together
with an analysis, synthesis, statistics and arguments given in this chapter directly
serve the strategic level planners to understand the role of national defence planning
in collective defence, along with benefits and contributions to it.

In this research study, I address the current Defence Planning system in RoA, the
changes it has experienced after NATO membership and the efforts being made to
further harmonize the collective defence system of the Alliance. Based on the
conclusions of first and second Chapters, the Chapter three has inside plenty of research,
analysis and recommendations for the actualization of our defence planning system. I
have also address the key Defence Planning documents of the RoA, as an ally country
and the potential disciplines of Defence Planning in RA, provides an original option of
the Level of Ambition of RA; formulates a set of Planning Scenarios/Situations of RA
as an allied country; recommends a Capability Based Planning in the RA; gives an
option of the necessary capabilities of the Future Force 2020; develops a concept of
specialized “niche” capabilities in the RA; formulates a conceptual framework of a
“Volunteer Reserve” force in AAF; and generates ideas for the institutionalization of a
periodic process of Strategic Defence Review (SDR) in RA.

_Col R Thimi Hudhra_

**-** In my research I have been focused on the issue of the process of Strategic

Defence Review (SDR) and its relations with Defence Planning. I have treated
the approach, goals, methods and national-wide engagement in SDR; analysis
of the experience of current national SDR progress 2013, as well as the articulation
of a ‘Smart Defence’ concept as a new approach to national and regional defence
planning.

**-  I have listed more than 30 findings and recommendations, which are coming as a**

logical result of the analysis, lessons learned, facts, arguments, and personal
experience. Findings and recommendations are associated with an implementation
action plan to develop a defence planning system as an allied country. I
recommend these findings are of great interest for the defence planning experts
and management staffs. Also, they can also serve the students of the Academy of
Defence, research centres, and other interested researchers.

**The Key Findings and Recommendations**

The research paper has identified 25 findings which give answers to the key questions
for the development of a national defence planning system for Albania harmonized
with the NATO Collective Defence Planning System (NDPP). The findings are shortly
described as follows:

1. **Harmonize our national defence planning system with that of NATO**

**collective defence. This includes harmonization of methodology, content,**
timelines, responsible authorities, and products of the 5 steps of collective defence
planning process of the Alliance (NDPP) with our defence planning system.
This finding can be implemented in accordance with the assessments and
recommendations given, based on a National Defence Planning directive. This
document, which shows _‘who does what’ in defence planning system, can be_
approved by the Minister of Defence every four years.

2. **Adopt a Capability Based Planning System in Albania (CBP). In the context**

of CBP, I support the development of a national professional military force based
not simply on the numbers, but first of all, on the quality of capabilities it develops.
Therefore, among the ten traditional systems of defence planning, I recommend
the Capability Based Planning Based method (CBP) as the most appropriate
method for our country, as a method that naturally integrates all positive aspects
of 10 defence planning methods, and better guarantees the harmonization with
the collective defence planning of the Alliance. In distinction from the traditional
term “force”, the term “capability” integrates 8 essential elements of DOTMLPFI
system: doctrine, organization, training, equipment, leadership, personnel,
infrastructure and interoperability.

3. **Develop a AAF Priority Plan to meet the goals of ‘Capability Targets of**

**Blue Book - 2013’. Capability development will be the key reform of the Armed**
Forces until 2020 and beyond. I recommend our country and AAF should plan
and implement with priority the 44 capability targets of the package of ‘Capability
_Targets of the Blue Book- 2013’, regarding our country’s obligations with the_
Alliance. To accomplish these targets, we should relate to the term “capability”,

137

_“A Defence Planning System under the NATO Collective Defence”_

i.e. meet their eight constituent elements. The Capability Based Planning (CBP)
relies on the comprehensive approach of “a single set of forces” concept. It is
linked both with national and international led operations by NATO/EU/UN or
ad-hoc coalitions.

4. **Adopt a Set of 12 planning disciplines in our national defence planning**

**system, as recommended. For this purpose, my research has designated relevant**
institutions/ departments responsible for each of the 12 planning disciplines and
the respective Boards established in their support. These boards can be activated
through a separate directive of the MOD, in accordance with the decision of the
Council of Ministers on the boards.

5. **Approve a Package/ Set of Planning Scenarios in AAF. I have recommended**

a Package/ Set of 5 strategic scenarios themes with 23 operational scenarios,
which can be reduced to 12-15 representative scenarios. For each scenario, it is
decided the role the national security institutions will play; considering options
such as the leading role, the supporting role, the coordinating role, or the
informative role. Planning scenarios are considered as a basic link between force
planning and operational planning.

6. **Review the AAF operational planning system at the strategic, operational**

**and tactical level. It is natural and logical that the adoption of the new set of**
planning scenarios as an allied country at the strategic level should be used for
the actualization of full spectrum operational plans down to tactical level units.
My recommendation is to establish cooperation with the Alliance for the
development, in due time, of all strategic plans for the collective defence of the
Republic of Albania, under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, as well as our
contribution to the Alliance to Article 5 ‘out of area’ operations. In my
understanding, the operational planning approach could be also followed by
other institutions of national security, especially related to planning scenarios
where they play a leading or supportive role.

7. **Establish a continuous and constructive dialogue between policy makers**

**and strategic military planners in the interest of national defence planning.**
Special role in finalizing the fundamental issues of defence planning must played
by MOD Defence Policy Council, Security Policy Committee of the Council of
Ministers and the National Security Council of the President of the Republic. I
also recommend the inclusion in the process of representatives of other interest
groups, stakeholders and civil society, to make this process transparent with
regard to spending of taxpayers’ money.

8. **Build a community of highly skilled civilian and military experts of all**

**disciplines of defence planning at MOD, Force level, and national**
representatives at NATO headquarters and force structure. My recommendation
is that this community should be managed, develop their career, and possibly
move within their planning discipline. Highly skilled and experienced early retired
officers and civilians can be successfully used in these positions.

9. **Formulate the Level of Ambition (LoA) of RA, which means the number of**

138


-----

_Col R Thimi Hudhra_

**simultaneous participation in national and international operations.** This

LoA should be stated in a political directive at the highest level, i.e., the Strategic
Defence Review document in process. The level of ambition of the country should
be more realistic and consistent with the economic and financial possibilities of
the country, with the capability targets of Article 5 and Non-Article 5 operations,
as well as with the AAF commitment to national civil emergencies. I
recommended a rational Level of Ambition and specific conditions applicable
in our country, which can be taken into consideration by the relevant authorities.

10. Reach the MoD target to support a defence budget of 1,5-2% of GDP by

**allocating up to 20% for AAF modernization. These figures are minimal to**
conduct qualitative reforms in the development of midterm capabilities for the
full spectrum of mission at home and abroad. These budget levels are based on
the Ministerial Directive of the Alliance, on the development of modern military
capabilities, deployable, sustainable and interoperable with allied standards.
Priorities of the defence budget will be focused on motivation of personnel,
modernization, individual and unit training, as well as contribution to national
and international operations.

11. Formulate a new National Security Strategy, Military Strategy and Long Term

**Development Plan (PAZH) as an allied country. These documents should be**
based on principles of collective defence, the Alliance Strategic Concept, as well
as the EU’s ESDP. In my mind, we have to complete as soon as possible these
strategic documents in accordance with the recently updated strategic documents
and policy of the Alliance, such as NATO Strategic Concept 2010. Also, my
recommendation is to follow the approach of equivalence of all national security
and defence documents with the respective collective defence documents. In this
context, in order to avoid the production of excessive traditional security and defence
documents, I recommend a realistic approach for the integration of some of strategic
documents, such as the national security strategy/policy and defence policy/military
strategy etc. Also, I recommend that PAZH is normally approved at the highest
possible political decision, in order to survive to rotations of political powers.

12. Institutionalize a periodic process of the Strategic Defence Review (SDR)

**in support of defence planning. In my judgment, only through a periodic analytic**
SDR process we can conduct qualitative reforms in the Armed Forces. For many
reasons, many ‘reforms’ in the last 20 years have been conducted simply on the
empirical basis and not based on such analytical processes. My recommendation
is that SDR should be conducted every 4-6 years including other security
institutions, interest groups and civil society. The SDR is following an assessment
of the necessary capabilities for the defence of the RA as a member of NATO,
especially in the context of the Alliance’s Strategic Concept and NATO Defence
Planning Process (NDPP) of 2009.

13. Update the teaching curricula of senior officers’ courses of AAF Academy

**and other schools with the theory and practice of defence planning. This**
research emphasises that all educational institutions and units of AAF Academy
and other schools should update their training curricula, education programs

139


-----

_“A Defence Planning System under the NATO Collective Defence”_

with Article 5/ Non-Article 5 operations with the Alliance, as well as national
civil emergency and asymmetric operations. It has also concluded that all AAF
staff unit training should be oriented to new tactical tasks based on the new
Planning Scenarios Package as an ally country. Also, the fundamental issues of
defence planning should be subject to strategic and operational research studies
of MoD research centres.

14. Continue the ratification and implementation of STANAGs in AAF

**according to the annual and long-term standardization plan in AAF. These**
Standardization Plans are based on the AAF operations under collective defence,
starting with the ‘capstone’ doctrines and then the main doctrines of operations
within and outside Article 5. Also, build the AAF doctrinal hierarchy, taking
into account that the doctrinal basis for operations outside Article 5 or Article 5,
will be the Alliance doctrinal basis. Main efforts on doctrinal development should
be focused on Armed Forces operations in national civil emergency and national
independent operations, according to Sets of Planning Scenarios recommended.

15. Develop the Mission Essential Tasks List for the three levels of AAF tasks:

**strategic, operational and tactical (ST, OT, TT), based on the experience of**
the NATO Task List’s (NTL) and Capability Codes and Statements of 2010. List
the three types of missions of AAF based on their constitutional mission and
types of NATO mission.

16. Establish a Readiness Unit System in AAF, based on the readiness category

**system expressed in the Alliance Force Standards (AFS - HRF / FLR / LTBF)**
for land forces, air force, navy, and unit staffs and other special units. This
readiness unit system should be also based on the types of units we have declared
and committed in the Capability Target Package CT-2013, Capability Codes and
Statements, and the relevant Alliance Forces Standards (AFS-1 and AFS-9) and
units for national typical missions. We should keep in consideration that the
units declared for international operations should be deployable and sustainable
(ie, have the capacity of strategic deployment and logistic support, etc.), beyond
the area of responsibility, within 10% to 50% of the total of AAF.

17. Adopt the Alliance TEEP system (ACT) for training, education, exercises

**and evaluation process in AAF units (individual and collective). My study**
supports the application of the 75-2,3,7 Directive for individual and collective
training and education. For this purpose, I recommend the introduction and
implementation of unit evaluation system CREVAL, TACEVAL, MAREVAL
for land, air and maritime units, according to their mission essential task lists.

18. Consider a ‘comprehensive approach’ concept at national level. In addition

**to military capabilities, we should also take into consideration the civilian**
**capabilities required by the CT-2013 package for stabilization and**
**reconstruction purposes. Civilian contributions can be identified by the**
capability target package. NATO collective defence is not simply an issue of
military capabilities; it is also an issue of civilian capabilities.

19. Develop a revision of the legal, organizational and doctrinal framework,

140


-----

_Col R Thimi Hudhra_

**and all state capabilities required for civil emergencies. This review should**

be conducted according to the SDR best practice, and aimed at further
improvement of coordination of inter-institutional efforts and a better
management of the entire national capabilities in the future, based on the findings
of the ‘lessons learned’ system.

20. Consider the development of a specialized role “niche” capability concept

**in AAF, according to the recommendations in this study. Participation in**
national and international operations will become more flexible in the future; in
addition to the traditional units we can make available non-traditional specialized
‘niche’ modules with high level ranking need in the NATO system.

21. Build a national concept for the development of a voluntary reserve

**component in the future AAF structure. This paper recommends the**
establishment of a experienced working group in the above matters to prepare a
set of conceptual, legal, organizational, motivational, training, financial for a
volunteer reserve component in AAF. Volunteer reserve component can focus
on civil emergencies and peace support operations of AAF, according to the
needs of commanders of forces / units. To do that, the Personnel and Recruiting
Centre can have an additional reserve component sector.

22. Develop a national document named “Assessment of Security Environment”

by a joint working group of all intelligence agencies, equivalent with the allied
document MC-161 “Intelligence Estimate”. This document can serve the Strategic
Defence Review and other documents of national security.

23. Adopt an integrated approach of ‘Smart Defence’ in the Defence Planning

**of RA, based on the Lisbon Strategic Concept. Capability development under**
the ‘smart’ concept will consider national, bilateral, multilateral and regional
options. This approach is in accordance and cooperation initiatives with countries
in the region, in particular with Kosovo, as well as other regional forms, with
the aim to develop ‘more capabilities with fewer resources’.

24. Introduce a C2 system based on the allied concept of “force user” and “force

**provider”, created with the modules / packages of capability targets. Priority**
of the defence reforms of small countries, our country included, will be focused
on the development of modular forces. Force modules based on the concept of
the modular force should be the basis for the Task Force concept. The
development of such a force is a relatively new culture and concept in AAF
versus the traditional force concept. Capability Based Planning (CBP) in our
case will be primarily focused on the employment of battalion/ company task
forces and sometimes even platoon level task force. These task force units, tailored
to the specific mission, will be the basis of future missions of AAF. Priority in
future scenarios will be given to training in the ‘task force’ format, either at
battalion or company/platoon level.

25. Develop a more rational and practical structure for the Future Force 2020

**based on the findings of the Strategic Defence Review. My paper outlines the**
recommendation that AAF priority should be on future force capabilities. Based

141


-----

_“A Defence Planning System under the NATO Collective Defence”_

on the capabilities generated by the Set of 13 SDR Scenarios our strategic planners
should identify surpluses and shortfalls of AAF capabilities, parallel structures,
and duplication of capabilities between the services of the Armed Forces, as
well as between different state institutions, in land, air and sea. My
recommendation is to avoid, if possible, the traditional structure of commands
of land, maritime, and air forces, and adopt a Joint Operational Command in the
General Staff, as a “force user” for the directly subordinate battalion level units
serving as “force providers”. With a target of 8500 force strength we cannot act
with the concepts of traditional forces. The concept of “force user” and ‘force
provider’ treated by the author may serve as “food for thoughts” on this issue.
There is also more place for a more integrated Ministry of Defence with General
Staff, in concept, management and organization structure.

As a conclusion, I think that, besides the cognitive, comparative and analytical
values of this doctorate thesis, it also promotes applicative values to be  applied in
the mid and long term. So, besides the retrospective analysis, this research study
provides a development platform with over 25 findings, recommendations offering
specific solutions for high civilian and military authorities regarding to issues of
national defence planning in the coming years.

I believe that my study can also serve strategic planners of Kosovo Security Force to
begin designing the Future Force of the Republic of Kosovo as an independent state.
They are welcome to learn from the progress we have made and the lessons we have
learned in the area of strategic defence planning.

Last but not least, I want you to know that I have used a broad literature of over 250
best authors in the area of national and international strategic planning, with some
9000 pages altogether. In addition to this broad literature, I think I have integrated
here my modest creativity based on knowledge, expertise and personal experience
of more than 20 years in this field.

**HISTORICAL STUDIES**

Among the contributions in field of military history is the paper of PhD. Bernard
Zotaj, who draws some important conclusions on the impact of Lezha
Convention on the political and military Albanian life at that historical period.
Creation of the Albanian state under the leadership of Skanderbeg was a great
historical victory of the Albanian people and the outcome of that legal process
for the creation of independent state formations in the Middle Ages. Unification
of Albanian people in a single state under the leadership of Skanderbeg helped
in forging political unity of the people in the struggle against the ottoman
invaders as well as consolidation of Albanian nationality, on the basis of
language, territory and psycho-cultural unity.

In Albanian Stradiots and their historical contribution, presented by Fotaq
Andrea, researcher, translator and former Ambassador of Republic of Albania
to European Parliament, the author states that the Stradiot phenomenon or the
Albanian estradotia, viewed in the historical context, the same as the Albanua
phenomenon, is not a coincidence. Above all, it must be considered as part of
the certain historical of economic and social conditions, as well as closely
related to the nature and character of the Albanians, the tribal organization, its
legal rights and attributes that explain the essence of these phenomena
themselves.

The researcher emphasizes that the period of the peak of Albanian estradiots,
before, after and during Scanderbeg time, crowned in a way with the prominent
Albanuaja, the Albanian coat of arms of the middle Ages, held even by the
King of France, is a valuable contribution of the Albanian people in European
history. This was made possible by a resistance for a quarter of a century against
the Ottoman Empire and with the bloodshed by the Albanian stradiots for two
centuries and “the flourishing of the European Renaissance, reformation,
exploration of the western world, where later would be housed hundreds of
thousands of his (Scanderbeg) offsprings.”

##### Lezha Convention, a major event in the national history of Albania

**Short commentary.** _The great Ottoman-Albanian War under Scanderbeg sped the_
_development of a legal and very important process, like that of the unification of the_
_country in a single and concentrated state. Overcoming the feudal fragmentation_
_and creating concentrated state formations is a phenomenon that occurred in the_
_period of developed feudalism. At this time the central government, based on the_
_support of cities, broke the feudal particularism and opened the way to greater_
_political formations where social forces interested in further development and_
_progress of the country could move. Not only Albania, but all the Adriatic- Balkan_
_area of XV century had reached such an internal development that could objectively_
_lead to the liquidation of feudal disunity and the formation of concentrated states._


n Albania, this objective process was hampered for a long time by foreign invaders,

but the great war of the Albanian people under the leadership of Skanderbeg
created new opportunities for resolving of this historical task, even though not

# Icompletely, which was prepared by the whole previous development in the country.

“…After the uprising against Timar regime, the main problem for the nation was to
unite political, military and economic forces in a single joint anti ottoman front.
Common people who suffered from burden of Ottoman oppression and exploitation
were primarily interested in this unification. Even the Albanian feudal lords were
already convinced due to their experience that staying detached from each other,
they could not stop the invasion of the country by the Ottoman armies and loss of
their feudal holdings”[1].

In order to solve the historic task of unification of the Albanian people and the
feudal class in a single anti ottoman front, Skanderbeg organized a national
convention. This convention has gone down in history as the “Lezha Convention”.
To this end, prior to the convention, a series of consultations with the Albanian

_Lezha Convention, a major event in the national history of Albania_

feudal lords and other leaders of the country were held to prepare the convention and
remove the obstacles from the road of unification[2].

Convention took place on March 2, 1444 in Lezha which at that time was under
Venetian rule. The organization of the Convention in Lezha intended to avoid any
misunderstanding among participants regarding the respect of feudal honours. On
the other hand it provided support or at least neutrality of Venice towards the great
Ottoman-Albanian war. That was the reason why the Republic of Venice and Ragusa
were invited to participate in the proceedings of the Convention.

Lezha convention was organized on the basis of the earliest Albanian tradition, to
address important problems in joint assemblies.

Lezha convention, convened and organized by Skanderbeg, marked the further
development of this tradition, because it was a nationally organized assembly.
Representatives from the most powerful feudal families participated in the convention.
Feudal rulers of principalities were present in the convention, accompanied by their
sons or their grandsons. Less important feudal rulers and other leaders, who
represented the free peasantry of Albanian Alps, took part in the convention

In his work “History of Skanderbeg”,[3] the contemporary and historian of Skanderbeg,
the Albanian humanist Marin Barleti, introduces the names of the Albanian rulers
who took part in the proceedings of the Convention. Among them was the initiator
and organizer of the Convention, Gjergj Kastrioti Scanderbeg, as the representative
of Kastrioti principality, Gjergj Araniti, Andrea Topia with his two sons, Komini and
Muzaka with his grandson Tanush Topia, Gjergj Stres Balsha, Teodor Korona Muzaka
with other members from Muzakaj family, Pal and Nikollë Dukagjini, Lek Zaharia,
Pjetër Spani with his four sons, together with some less influential feudal lords near
his principality etc. Participants in the Convention came from the Albanian-speaking
territories. The only exception was Stefan Cernojevic, the ruler of Zeta (Montenegro),
whose possessions, inhabited mostly by Albanians, were near Shkodra Lake. He also
had family ties with Skanderbeg, because he was married to one Scanderbeg’s sisters.

The representative of Venice also participated the Convention with the status of the
observer. Republic of Raguza refused to take part in order not to complicate its
relationships with the Sultan of Ottoman Empire.

After numerous discussions Lezha Convention, made important decisions, this defined
the political nature of this event. Despite differences dictated by the narrow interests,
the feudal lords of the gathered in the Convention expressed their will to unite in the
war against the Ottoman occupation.

The idea of joining all political, military and economic forces in a common front was
materialized in several decisions it made. The most important among them was
decision for the creation of an Albanian feudal covenant, which was named “League
of Albanian princes” (League of Lezha). As the organizer and leader of the liberating

uprising against the regime of Timars, and because of the important position that
Kastrioti principality had, Skanderbeg was unanimously elected its chairman.

Barleti gives very rich information on Lezha Convention and its decisions. He says
that Skanderbeg “first of all decided that it was necessary to create an alliance and
establish a sort of permanent covenant with the neighbouring princes and rulers...”[4].
In the following pages, after describing the proceedings of this convention, he states
that all of them (the feudal lords) “ ... after passing almost voluntarily the power,
people of their principalities, the armies, and after trusted him the supreme leadership
of all the people and the care for the war, they elected him as their only chairman and
captain”[ 5].

Although the chairman and Commander-in-Chief, Skanderbeg was at that time a
“first among equals”. However, the assignment of a single political and military
leader had a great importance and was a step forward in overcoming feudal disunity[6].

The data that Barleti brings are confirmed and completed by the memories of the
Albanian boyar Gjon Muzaka, one of the members of Muzakaj family, a contemporary
of Skanderbeg. He writes: “…then these rulers of Albania convened in an assembly
in Lezha. Someone went himself, someone sent viceroys. So the aforementioned
Skanderbeg became the overlord of Albania, and each sent people and money
according to the quantity he had to. Progeny of some of those rulers fought under his
command as well to learn the craft of the war that would help them defend their
principalities. Being so much hardened at war and very brave, he (Scanderbeg) was
elected as Commander-in-Chief and everybody had to obey him”[ 7].

Participation in the League guaranteed to every feudal lord the right of protection
from invaders and the obligation to contribute to the creation of the army and the
common funds. Two important decisions of Lezha Convention are associated with
these liabilities: the decision to create an army of “League of Albanian princes” as
well as provision of funds for the war expenses of with joint efforts.

Lezha Convention decided to create an Albanian army, which will be recruited by
Scanderbeg in Kastrioti principality and from other feudal lords in their possessions.
Each member of the League voluntarily determined the number of soldiers he would
contribute for the establishment of the common army. Scanderbeg was elected
Commander-in-Chief of the League army, while the commanders of the units were
to be appointed by boyards themselves.

In order to meet the expenses of the war, Lezha Convention decided to establish a
special fund in cash, which would be provided partly by the contribution of the
Albanian feudal lords and partly from the incomes of Shën Kolli salt-works in the

north of Durres, which belonged to Kastriots[8]. Financial means, and the army would
be administered by Skanderbeg, who, among other boyards, gave the major
contribution for the cause of liberating war in soldiers and money. Skanderbeg was
charged by the Lezha Convention with many leading and commanding tasks. Thus,
he had the main responsibility in conducting the war.

Strategically “League of Albanian princes “was the most powerful political-military
alliance (covenant) between the Albanian boyards with each other to protect their
feudal holdings with joint forces. In their possessions, Albanian boyards participating
in the Convention were independent rulers and possess any absolute power holders.

Regardless of his leading and commanding role of Scanderbeg in the “League of
Albanian princes”, his leading position in the first years of League’s existence was
not that of a monarch, but that of a military leader. His leadership consisted only in
the organization of country’s defence, without affecting the privileges of particular
feudal lords and their power within their holdings. In comparison with other members
of the League Scanderbeg enjoyed the right to convene the Albanian princes whenever
he deemed it right for the country’s defence. League’s members had the right to
leave it whenever they thought it necessary. Scanderbeg as the chairman of the League
and the league itself had no right to prevent him or take measures against him.

In League feudal boyards maintained the right to enter into international relations
independently. In later years, a good part of the Albanian princes concluded
international treaties with Italian states, regardless of Skanderbeg and League. Gjergj
Araniti concluded a special treaty with Alfonso of Naples (1451), and another with
Venice. Other boyards behaved in the same way.

Common war against the Ottoman Empire and Venice imposed the need that in the
decisions about the issues of international relations it was the “League of Albanian
princes “the representing authority, not any particular boyard. During the war with
Venice in 1448, after the death of Lek Zaharia, Skanderbeg requested Danja city on
behalf of the League. Victory was achieved by the joint efforts of the Albanian feudal
lords. Whereas the Peace Treaty (October 4, 1448) was completed by “League of
Albanian princes” as a party, represented by Scanderbeg and Nikollë Dukagjini and
Republic of Venice. In the history of the League of Lezha this is the first case when
it appears as a single authority in face of two dangerous enemies, the Ottoman Empire
and Venice. The League fought and won to defend the country and its territorial
integrity, and acted with full political personality in international relations.

Lezha Convention and decisions made by it, had historical significance for the fate
of the great war of Albania against Ottoman Empire in the XV century.

League of Lezha and its Commander-in-Chief, Skanderbeg, enjoyed unlimited support
from the people. In these circumstances the war took the typical features of a popular
war. It was exactly this factor that enabled our country to face the attacks of the
Ottoman army, the most powerful of that time, though with relatively limited human
and economic resources. Victories of wars and battles that took place for twenty-five

years against the hordes of Ottoman army, relied on the freedom-loving spirit of the
people, on his moral and combat qualities, on the experience of centuries of wars, as
well as on the commanding and ingenious military skills of the Chief Commander
Gjergj Kastrioti-Scanderbeg[9].

Politically, Lezha Convention was the only body at national level within which the
unity of the Albanian people and the Albanian feudal class in the war against the
Ottoman occupation was carried out. With the feudal basis and decisions made Lezha
Convention objectively expresses the interests of the Albanian people who, more
than anyone else required protection against severe consequences caused by Ottoman
occupation.

Strategically Lezha Convention was a constitutional body, which proceeded with the
creation of such bodies of general importance like “League of Albanian princes”,
unique command of the army under the leadership of Skanderbeg and common funds
to afford war expenses. Creation of joint bodies was of great importance. It marked
the first step towards strengthening the central government and going beyond the
tight framework of feudal fragmentation.

In the Great War between Albania and the Ottoman Empire took place the process of
state formation. This state included a good part of the Albanian territory. “League of
Albanian princes” and bodies that emerged from Lezha Convention underwent
significant changes, which led to the change of their political and military nature.

With the creation of the League of Lezha first and very important step on the road to
unification was made.  In the early years of the war, it gave a good support to
Skanderbeg in facing the Ottoman conquest and the hostile policy of Venice[10]. Over
the years other forces that weakened its unity started to act within the League. League
of Lezha, was created as a political and military alliance of Albanian boyards in the
common fight against Ottoman occupation. It stood on the basis of feudal
fragmentation that implied respect for sovereignty and privileges of particular boyards.

Based on these privileges, the Albanian feudal lords kept troops that acted under
their orders out of the frame of the army. They often did not meet the obligations
imposed by Lezha Convention to help with soldiers and money. There were times
that they left the League, like the case of Pjetër Spani and Lek Dushmani in 1447
during the conflict with Venice and later the Dukagjins did the same[11].

The wavering attitude of the Albanian feudal lords was encouraged and used by the
Ottomans and the Venetians. By dividing the Albanian boyards they aimed at achieving
their interests. In a decision of Venice Senate, dated October 10, 1448, which provided
guidance for its province in Albania, it is underlined “If you do not come to terms
with Skanderbeg, meet Pal and Nikollë Dukagjini and promise them money, villages,
etc… and thus separating them from Scanderbeg and join them with us ... for we are

informed that Skanderbeg without Dukagjins is not capable of doing anything ...”[12].

The Great War between Ottomans and Albania was a total war. It sought the unification
of all forces by strengthening the central government. Higher interests of the country’s
defence dictated the necessity of overcoming feudal fragmentation and the creation
of the Albanian state. In realization of this historical process Skanderbeg had a broad
support by the people, who were interested in the successful conduct and crowning
of the war; he relied on the permanent that he had at his disposal as the Commanderin-Chief.

The Albanian Army, created for the country’s defence needs, both in Kastrioti
possessions and possessions of other boyards, was a powerful and effective tool
against feudal particularism. Pursuant of his policy, Skanderbeg relied especially on
small feudal lords, who served as army commanders and political officials in his
state. They found at the central government not only an effective defence from the
Ottoman scourge, but also from the permanent threat of the most powerful feudal
lords[13].

To further connect the ruling class with the liberation struggle of the Albanian people,
on behalf of the central government, Skanderbeg, pursued a policy of distributing
ownership for the benefit of boyards that were serving to him or reducing tributes
they had to pay for the state. He defined the rule that they had to participate personally
in the war together with a certain number of soldiers. For instance, he gave such
possessions and lands to Vrana Konti, Hamza Kastrioti, Moisi Golemi and other
boyards.

M. Barleti notes this political act of Skanderbeg and reflects it on the pages of his
work. He writes: “We should not be surprised about the immediate raise and about
almost incredible speed of ours concerning the levy of soldiers, because Skanderbeg,
either due to his desire ... or as bravery reward, had released a great amount of taxes
for his nobles, especially properties, on the condition that when the war needed it
they would be obligated by his order to contribute with troops, everyone according
to his capacity and be engaged themselves for everything that had to be done”[ 14]. An
important factor in strengthening the power and authority was Skanderbeg’s prestige
among the people and his boyard allies. Skanderbeg used this to increase the authority
of the central bodies and the command of the army. Another supporting element was
the multiple marriage links among the most powerful feudal lords with Kastriots
which had started since the time of Gjon Kastrioti and continued during the time of
Skanderbeg in order to ensure a tighter unification of the Albanian feudal class.

For the sake of the interests of the defence of the country, Skanderbeg, as the
representative of the central government, began to violate the sovereignty of particular
feudal lords within their principalities, making them there not independent lords,
but obedient government officials that depended directly on him in their castles and

violated the boundaries of their possessions during combat operations. The need to
fill the army with young warriors forced him to mobilize recruits on his own initiative
even in other feudal holdings, etc.[15].

These actions were not only a violation of sovereignty of ally boyards, but also an
exercise of the attributes of power in the territories that did not belong to Kastrioti
principality. In this way, the power of particular feudal lords gradually began be
shunned and weakened, as the central government, represented by Skanderbeg became
stronger. Their possessions began to merge with the principality of Kastrioti.

Reflecting this process of historical importance for the fate of the great war of Albania
against Ottomans the boyard Gjon Muzaka writes in his memoirs that Skanderbeg
“after becoming the chief commander of the Albanian feudal lords... decided to
seize the whole country ... He imprisoned the nobles Gjon and Gojko Balsha...and
put under his control their ‘state’ that was between Kruja and Lezha; he got the
‘state’ of Moisi Komnei in Dibra…and after the death of my father took Tomorrishta,
i.e. _Myzeqeja e Vogël and he did so with other boyards…but they could not do_
anything because he had the warriors with him and the Ottomans were present at
every moment…”[16].

Gjon Muzaka openly expresses that these were violent measures and hopes of
Skanderbeg increased after Pope Piu II declared a crusade against the Ottomans and
promised him the crown of Albania.

Testimony of the boyard Gjon Muzaka, who was disappointed by this policy of
Skanderbeg, is confirmed and supplemented diplomatically by M. Barleti, who states
that “he (Skanderbeg) had included in his kingdom the two Dibras with their will”.[17]
In addition to that, M. Barleti testifies that Skanderbeg “put under his control and
expanded the boundaries of his kingdom more than his father, Gjon”[18], that part of
his principality became even “Mokra which he had never experienced Kastrioti’s
rule”[ 19].

The strengthening of power and the creation of state was a process that did not occur
immediately. It started before the year 1450 and continued rapidly over the years
1450-1460. Of particular significance in this respect was the great victory achieved
by the Albanian people under the leadership of Skanderbeg during the first siege of
Kruja (1450), which further increased the authority of Skanderbeg, both domestically
and abroad. During this difficult test a part of the ally boyards left the League of
Lezha which once again showed the necessity of overcoming feudal fragmentation
as a serious threat to the fate of the liberation war. After the first siege of Kruja, as a
result of coercion measures that Skanderbeg took, not just less important feudal
lords, but also the great ones, as Muzakajt,Topiajt, Balshajt gradually lost their

position as independent feudal lords and their principalities were joined with that of
Skanderbeg.

Despite the efforts of Skanderbeg, two of the most powerful feudal possessions of the
country, that of Dukagjin in the north and that of Gjergj Araniti in the south, for a long
time did not join the Albanian state, but remained as separate feudal principalities.

Aranits considered Skanderbeg only as an ally, without subduing to his will. However,
with the death of Gjergj Araniti (Skanderbeg’s father-in-law), he managed to unite this
powerful principality with the state. In 1463 Skanderbeg concluded a ceasefire agreement
with the Ottoman Empire. Among the obligations that the Albanian party took as part
of this agreement is was to send one of Gjergj Araniti’s sons in Sultan’s army whenever
the need arose. Unable to oppose her groom, Gjergj Araniti’s widow, on September 3,
1463 went to the Venetian Senate and urged them to influence over the Skanderbeg not
to send her son to Sultan’s army. The Venetian Senate replied that such a thing would
not happen, because “although his majesty Mr. Skanderbeg made peace with the
Ottomans, however, we could hope that he would take up arms against Sultan.”[ 20]. This
fact shows that in that period Skanderbeg had extended his power over Araniti’s
principality as he imposed liabilities on its rulers without their prior consent.

Dukagjins in the north maintained their position as independent lords. Urged by
Venice for a long time they kept a hostile policy towards Skanderbeg and his policy
sometimes by cooperating with Ottomans to the detriment of the issue of liberation.
In 1463 Lekë Dukagjini addressed a series of requests and proposals to the Republic
of Venice. Among other things, he stated that “I should not be under Skanderbeg, but
I am very glad to be under every rector or proveditor of that Milady and always stay
under its orders. I also require that if Skanderbeg declares war on me, or I declare
war on him, her majesty Milady help me.” And Venice responded, “We are pleased
to fulfil his request, i.e. that he should not be under his majesty, Skanderbeg, but
under our provisory or rector of those regions”[21]. As result of Skanderbeg’s coercive
policy a part of the Albanian feudal lords left the League of Lezha and began searching
support at foreign powers, such as Venice or Naples or openly betrayed Skanderbeg,
like Hamza Kastrioti, Moisi Golemo, Gjergj Stres Balsha or any other. Relying on
popular support and the army available, Skanderbeg took energetic violent measures
against feudal treason and imprisoned the offenders, without even sparing his close
relatives, like Hamza Kastrioti, Gjergj Stres Balsha or any other. Measures taken by
Skanderbeg on behalf of the power, in the name of utter defeat of the feudal treason,
directly served to the unity and strengthening of the country’s defence capability and
further unification of the Albanian lands in a single state.

With the leave of some of the Albanian boyards from the League of Lezha it lost the
previous character and importance as a political and military alliance of the Albanian
feudal lords to protect their holdings with joint forces.

Governing bodies of the army and finance that functioned within the framework of
the League of Lezha, were merged with those of Kastrioti principality, gaining the

20 Burime të zgjedhura për Historinë e Shqipërisë, Ibid. p 337.

importance of the central state organs. State administration bodies of particular
boyards, continued to exercise their functions, but now subordinated to the central
government. Vassal feudal lords, who lost their position as separate rulers, became
the central government officials and depended directly from Skanderbeg.

The old feudal principalities lost their character as separate state formations as they
extended and equalized with the Albanian state[22]. Their former boundaries no longer
existed; instead the Albanian state extended from the Adriatic coast to Prizren and
from Devol and Seman River in the south, including the holdings of Aranits in Central
Albania up to Dibër and Pollog.

Skanderbeg’s state could not include within its borders all Albanian-speaking
territories. Outside these borders remained areas occupied by the Ottomans and
cities conquered by Venice and the principality of Dukagjin in the North. From
territorial point of view the state unification of Albania was not fully achieved.
However, the state of Skanderbeg was concentrated because of its internal
organization. From vassal way of governing, which was an outdated form, typical
for the period of feudal fragmentation Skanderbeg organized country governance by
officials, who acted on behalf of the government.

The Albanian state, founded and led for a quarter of a century by Skanderbeg (14431468), continued to exist even after the death of National Hero, until 1478, when
Kruja its capital and main stronghold of the country’s defence. Throughout this
decade, although with incomplete territories gradually cut off by Ottoman invaders,
it continued to carry out its main functions in the unequal struggle between the small
Albania and the Ottoman Empire. At the announcement of Sultan Mehmet II dedicated
to the collapse of Kruja (1478), after the description of invaders’ atrocities against
its defenders, we find the defined goals for the destruction of the political and military
organization created during that historical era. “Calls from their crushed breasts
reached up to the ceiling of Saturan. A total of about five thousand infidels, who
were each a devil oil and lightning launchers, were cut by a sword so sharp and the
striking arrow ... thereafter will begin the destruction of churches, the construction
of medresses, prohibition of bells and ruin of laws”[23].

Creation of the Albanian state under the leadership of Skanderbeg was a great historical
victory of the Albanian people and the outcome of that legal process for the creation of
independent state formations in the Middle Ages. Unification of Albanian people in a
single state under the leadership of Skanderbeg helped in forging political unity of the
people in the struggle against the ottoman invaders as well as consolidation of Albanian
nationality, on the basis of language, territory and psycho-cultural unity[24].

##### Albanian Stradiots and their historical contribution


Fotaq Andrea

Researcher, Translator, Former Ambassador of RoA

to European Parliament, Strasbourg, France

**_Short commentary. The same as for Albanua, the historic Albanian coat of arms,_**
_Albanian historiography* has been, we would say, somewhat limited on the subject of_
_Albanian Stradiots. However, it must be admitted that the topic was recently elaborated_
_by numerous Albanian researchers, among others by Father Zef Valentine, Irakli_
_Koçollari, Aristidh Kola, Moikom Zeqo, Ferid Hudhri, etc. In this study, despite referring_
_to the authors already mentioned above, we will focus primarily on foreign authors,_
_especially on French authors, to give a somewhat more complete picture of Albanian_
_Stradiots, although the topic is broad and goes beyond the limits of this study ._


ince the outset, it must be said that the Stradiot phenomenon or the Albanian
estradotia, viewed in the historical context, the same as the Albanua
phenomenon, is not a coincidence. It must be considered above all as part of

# Sthe certain historical of economic and social conditions, as well as closely related to

the nature and character of the Albanians, the tribal organization, its legal rights and
attributes that explain the essence of these phenomena themselves. Let us look on
the following issues:

_Firstly, the phenomenon emerged in the early eleventh century as a result of foreign_
threat, when Albanians faced attacks of Normans, Serbs, Bulgarians, Venetians,
Catalans, etc. Albanians were forced to descend in mass to the South in the territories
of the continental Greece and islands. In these conditions, the Byzantine Empire
which was growing weaker, took measures to strengthen its military machine, by
setting up new settlements or military colonies that were called “Stratopia”. Residents
of these colonies, or military settlements in Greece (Stratopias were formed entirely
by people coming from Arbëria (later called “Albanian) territories, selected with
clear goals and criteria for combat skills, being called by the Greek term “Stratiots”[1]

_Albanian Stradiots and their historical contribution_

It is precisely the creation of stratopies with Albanian stradiots which not only explains
the measures taken by the Byzantine Empire for its strengthening, but peacefully the
settlement of Albanian tribes among indigenous Greek populations[2], thus appearing
as a “driving factor for qualitative progress and and development” of Greece itself,
as it will happen in other subsequent historical analogue cases. Residents of Stratopis
not only filled the ranks of war units, but also gained the privilege of possessing the
land ownership, a privilege that in fact, was enjoyed by a common population, which
was forced to work in the lands of the local feudals.

The contemporary scholar Edvin Jacques, quoting the Byzantine historian _Kantek,_
notes that in the period 1202-1204, Byzantine quarrels between nobles and Latin
lords, after the Fourth Crusade, had deserted the Greek village. “Arvanitas or the
Albanian newcomers, he says, were placed in the deserted lands, cut forests and
opened new lands. Thanks to the work of these experienced farmers, lands were
ploughed and planted with different cereals. These Albanians came not as conquerors,
but as refugees, who would be living and working in Greece’s progress and would
give their lives for independence from Turkey”.[3]

_Regarding the Albanian origin of Stratopis, the researcher Koçollari cites a letter of_
_the last Byzantine Emperor M.Paleologu in the XII century, addressed to his brother_
Theodore, prince of Morea, in which is considered as one of the greatest successes,
the settlement of Arvanites (Albanians) in the principality of of Morea: “...With this
army (Albanians)-states the Emperor Paleologos-which has never before suffered
losses, but on the contrary is considered as a highly skilled and successful army, has
not spent anything, but are already making excellent impressions everywhere ... If
you come with this army to Peloponnesus (Prince Theodore writes to him), the army
is not small, but big enough and powerful, versatile and very capable, and we did
everything that was necessary on our part”[4]. In this period dates a document of 1295,
the sevastocrate of Phanar (Thessaly), sent to his subordinates, in which it is mentioned
the settling of the Albanians in Greek lands on the basis of laws end empire orders.
“... I will not allow, coming here Albanians besides those located in land heritages
about castles (the lantern), or those that have been deployed on the basis of guides
and imperial orders...”[5].

Referring to the well-known orientalist N. Sathas, Father Zef Valentine on his part,
notes that in the early eleventh century, emerged as Stradiots, four members of the

2. George Guillet would emphasise in this regard: “However, out of all the people of Greece, only
Epirotes,called today Albanoi, and maniots, the miserable remnant of lakedemonas, could hinder the
progress of the Turks. Albanoi were defeated in 1466 when the famous Skanderbeg died, their undefeated
prince. And then spread that became the subjects of his troops, a good part pulled between maniots,
who were received with joy and gave their shelters in the craggy mountains. As far as religion is
concerned, they still preserve the religion of the other Greeks. They have among them many callogers,”
cited according to the book “Athènes ancienne et nouvelle”, Paris, 1657, p. 32-33.

prominent Basta military Dynasty, among which continued to be born other famous
military.

Another evidence of this period on the emergence of Stradiots is brought also by the
Frenchman _Andre-Grasset Saint Sauveur Jr. when speaking about albanoive_
incursions in the states of Naples in 1258-1309. Philip, Charles’ brother, marched to
stop them. “Albanoi took advantage of the occasion when Charles was busy in Sicily,
to make frequent incursions into the provinces of his country. Philip, Prince of
Tarentes, brother of the king of Naples, marches to halt their progress ... progressed
against albanoi who were commanded by someone called Spatafori. He attacked
them by surprise, disbanded them and penetrated deeply in the territories of Greece”.
He continues: “As Rober, under whose rule Corfu people were happy, would die ...,
but at that time, Bajazit, sovereign of the Turks, had just expelled and plagued the
father of Depan, the leader of Albanoi, who took refuge in Corfu, where they were
welcomed and stayed until Bajazit himself fell dead in combats with Timurleng”[6].

Meanwhile, we note that the Albanian knights were in service of Venice in XII-XIII
centuries, having special missions to maintain order in the Venetian dominions. This
is proved by some Venetian documents, and a decree of the Senate that seeks “to
encourage as much as possible to the island inhabitants the weapons’ sale in order to
maintain order in the island. Governors of Parga, Butrint (Buthrotus) and Bastia
were ordered to form a corps of soldiers drawn from the island (Corfu) and put in the
service of the republic. They avoided the mercenary troops from Albania, because
they had interest as their only goal”.[7] An interesting proof is found also in an order
issued by the King of Cyprus in Nicosia for maintaining the Kaputi fords in 1468, in
which it written that the Venetians, since the time of Luzinjans, a troop of Albanian
Stradiots were kept with the special mission of protecting and preserving the
seashores.[8]

The Count Arthur de Gobineau, who spoke frequently and with sympathy for the
Albanians and their ancient ethnicity, would point out: “All the armies know and use
(stradiots). In the twelfth century, the Germans, the French, the Spanish, the Pope,
Fiorentins and Duke of Milan have been in their service. The Venetian Signor recruited
stradiots in the thirteenth century and the British of the Seven Islands have them still
in service today. Although _Bayard, highly evaluates Captain Merkurio and his_

8. M.L.de Mas Latrie, “Histoire de l’île de Chypres,” Paris 1855, p. 238, 464-465. In the note we read:
“Albanoj were over a thousand in number, and traveled by horse the entire coast, in groups of two, and
so did the surveillance. If they discovered anything (pirate ship arrivals), they would burn alarm fires.
They used to talk in the island for a “Societas ad stradiotum”, a building society or militia in the
stradiot manner. Venetians had all their possessions in the east, and especially in More, Albanians with
horses, armed with shields, spears and swords would receive a payment from the republic to protect
the country. These knights would name themselves as stradiots, the name by which the Knights were
named in Albania. They were organized in companies and often became part of them also the citizens
of the country where they would stay.

_Albanian Stradiots and their historical contribution_

Albanians, even he did not agree in any case with their severity and the redemption
methods used by them, the light cavalry companies were soon filled with such people
and some of these war masters were settled in France, where they lived like honest
people. But most of them, after long campaigns, returned to their homes, in Epirus,
Thessaly, Macedonia, More...”[9]

_Secondly, the full blooming stage of Albanian estradiots is the period before, during_
and after the blooming of the Arber Albanian state under the leadership of Gjergj
Kastrioti (George Castriot), in the period 1400-1600. Thus, for over two centuries
Albanian stradiots were at their peak of existence, emerging as flag-bearers and
activists leading the European light cavalry, the first theoretical “manifesto” which
would be created by later by an Albanian General, Gjergj Basta.

Birth and development of the Albanian estradiots was conducted, as noted by Father
Valentine, on the basis of legal features of the tribe in the Albanian community,
which marked it with “a perfect individuality”, with the right to have a degree of
certain autonomy and its armed forces, as well as the right for the village to make
alliances, wars and establish pacts with others, the right to make foreign policy and
finally, the right to have their leader.

Father Valentine’s analysis of the legal features of the tribe in the Albanian community,
their qualities and rights of their military nature on one hand and on their movement
in the North-South axis (Albania-Greece), on the other hand, supports the conclusion
of the Researcher Koçollari that military settlements in Greece (stratopias), as
highlighted above, were “completely formed by people coming from the region
Arbëria”. Furthermore, the researcher Koçollari insists that these settlements “were
called upon this day in their own “village” language.[10] Inhabitants of stratopias not
only filled the ranks of war units, but also earned the privilege of taking possession
of land, a privilege in fact, not enjoyed by the common population, which was forced
to labour in local feudal lands.

On the basis of these phenomena and characteristics, as well as on the basis of the
data presented by Father Valentine, inhabitants of populated areas, we understand
the collective displacement of the large Albanian stradiot families, who have followed
geographically the moving north-south axis, and very rarely the South-North axis.
Then, starting from the South of Albania, this movement has continued until Greece,
and one can note the large historical displacements of Albanian tribes, which followed
the direction of Italy, whether in South (Sicily, Calabria, Naples), either in North
(mainly in the Venetian area and in Lombardia).

Based on the toponomy of populated areas, but also on the as well as on the names of the
Stradiot inhabitants (while the name Gjin, is typical), Father Valentine notes that often
the last name “Stradiot” is used either in the Gheg or the Tosk areas, always based on the
moving axis of the Albanian tribes moving from North to South, to South-Greece, Italy
and North Greece-Italy. Understandably, then, from Italy, Albanian Stradiots would travel
towards Spain, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Austria and beyond.

Toponyms of the same tribal surname are used in the North (the regions of Mat and
Lura), as well as in the Middle Albania, as in the case of the surname Buziki or
Buzhuqi. The surname Dara is found in the region of Rrjoll, as well as in Italy and
Greece (Arkadi); the surname Dorëza (coupled with the name “Gjin”), is found in
the regions of Peza, Peqin, Korce, Çermenika, Tepelena, as well as in Italy, Greece
(Arkadi, Cephalonia). The most typical surname in those regions is the Albanian
surname Jonima, which was very widespread in North-South toponomy (in the regions
of Rrjoll Gruemira, Grizhja, Dajç, Lura, Kurbin, Durres, Elbasan, Dukat, historically
found also in Naples, Italy. The same can be said about the surname “Kelmendi” so
widespread among Albanian stradiots, cited as well by foreign authors, and found in
Albania, as well as in Greece (More) or in Italy (Piana degli Albanesi of Sicily).

On the other hand, in the work of Father Valentine, we also note that generally in
XVII-XVIII centuries, an Albanian village, be it large or small, of averagely 100
residents, and 21-23 armed men in uniforms. I think that this figure must have been
even greater during the peak of the Albanian estradiots one or two centuries ago,
given their military mobilization under “village” way, under their leader or master.
Hence, averagely an estradiot family having 12-14 members should have had 3-4
armed men, which meant that the person who was the head of the family, followed
by two, three or four men, must have necessarily been stradiots, or people who exercise
“the craft” of war.

_Thirdly, the Albanian military element transformed into Stradiot military, in this_
flourishing period of Albanian estradiots, were forced to emigrate en masse to the
west, especially when facing Ottoman conquest, after a quarter century of active and
lonely resistance, while the Albanian Janissaries, forced by law, would operate with
as much vehemence in the East performing great services to sultans[11]. Evidence for
this massive forced migration are numerous and painful including Albanian and
foreign authors, ranging from Pope Paul II who describes the plight of refugees in
1466: “No man is able to see without shedding tears, these tormented refugees passing
through the ports of Italy Ureta, naked, displaced from their homes, while lie along
the sea and raise hands to the sky and cry in a language that nobody understands.”[12]

The scholar Dh.S. Shuteriqi describes two serious exodus episodes suffered by the “
tormented people from Shkodra” as he would name them, guerrillas of the Albanian
heroic resistance: in the years 1479 and 1501, and the latter just after the TurkishVenetian peace that began on April 25, St. Mark’s day as it was ironically for the
Albanians. The exodus of 1479, he writes: “... people were overwhelmingly common
people, anonymous homeland defence, together with women, children and the elderly,
had escaped from the target of the Ottoman and hunger, which had forced them to eat

11 The researcher Mihail Dimitri Strudza, giving a full definition on stradiots, notes that there are
“organized military units from the republic of Venice and Naples kings in order to fight the Turks, and
vice versa, unit placed by the Ottoman Empire for protection against Christian Balkans powers,
consisting of different elements and different ethnic origin. Albania supplied most of these fighters
with people who were given names and region different from names and religion they had had before”
(Grandes familles de Grèce, d’ Albanie et de Constantinople, Paris, 1999, p. 83.)

whatever they found, as Marin Barleti tells us. According to Beçikemi, the population
of Shkodra suffered the exodus which to their knowledge consisted of the social
categories: the nobles, the owners (middle class once serving as Roman knights) and
the middle class”.[13]

As quoted above, the French historian _Fernand Braudel described how Albanian_
fighters fled in the sixteenth century, followed by women, children and their priests.
“Regents of Algiers and Tunis did not accept them, says Braudel, and then neither
the Moldovan nor Bojard countries. Then they flocked to the service of the Sublime
Gate ... Neither wondering what camp to defend, “Where is the Sword, there is the
religion.” “We are with those who keep us alive.”

The researcher Edwin Jacques notes that during nearly a century (1448-1535) only
in southern Italy are known eight influxes of Albanians, namely:

-  1443, Alfonso V of Naples hired to fight Albanian troops under the command
of Dhimiter Rera (who founded the 13 Albanian villages near Katanzaro in
Sicily);

-  1462, in the Italian lands given to Scanderbeg, settled some of the veterans
tired of numerous battles;

-  In 1467, two Catholics from Shkodra due to the fear of advance of Turks
took with themselves the picture of the Good Lady (Lady of Shkodra) and
crossed over the Adriatic in Genacano near Rome. Her image became very
famous in popular Arbëresh religion;

-  1468-1479, after the death of Skanderbeg and fall of Kruja and Shkodra, the
painful exile following afterwards, Pope Pius II describes their arrival in
Italy. It is mentioned at this time the settlement of the Albania family in
Rome who would win fame and fortune in the art world. Albanians settled in
Calabria and Sicily, where they founded their towns

-  In 1487, after the suppression of the uprising, Gjergj Kastriot (George
Castriot) and his followers were not sheltered neither in Palermo nor in Naples
due to fear that the Turks would get angry and declare war. Pope intervened
to shelter refugees in Calabria and Sicily. Since these newcomers from
southern Albania were Orthodox, they were mistakenly thought to be Greeks
and their the province was called “Piana dei Greci”. The error was corrected
later, in the time of Mussolini, by being called “Piana degli Albanesi”

-  1502, the wave of refugees was increased after the Turkish invasion across
Albania. The more Turks conquered lands in the Greek territory, particularly
after 1535, the greater got the number of arvanit people who escaped across
the Adriatic;

-  Migration ended in 1774. Many of the refugees embraced the Greek rituals
more than Roman rites. They had two bishops, one in Calabria and one in

Sicily in Piana degli Albanesi. To ease their transition to the Latin rite, on
1576, Pope Gregory XIII established the Greek College in Rome.

_Fourthly, the Albanian estradiot phenomenon is an expression of the qualities and_
traits of Albanian nature itself, which comply with the spirit and energy of his
determined character, with its military capability and organizational qualities, as
Prof. Çabej witnesses: “Military skills is inborn of this race, and it has put the seal of
the Albanian soldier.” “Est enim (hec) Albania regio satis lata et magna, habens
_homines belliscosos ualde, sunt enim optimi sagitarii et lancearii”, says the_
Anonymous descriptio Europae Orienalis in 1308. The nature of the soldier is a
common trait of character, a constant attribute of this nation”[14]

Voltaire, mentioning Albanoi soldiers, would synthesize perfectly, historically
speaking, the Albanian combatant character: “...used to fighting among the rocks,
since they are those ancient Epirus who have made †a name for being god fighters
the same as their ancestors”.[15]

Among the physic-moral- military traits of the Albanian, that would directly affect
the image of Albanoi estradiot, in his fame and European contribution paid with the
price of blood, we highlight among others, their bravery, honesty in alliances, zeal
and loyalty to serve, the prediction of danger and of complex situations, especially
in the field of war, the extraordinary wisdom of the mind, the courage deriving from
a of life full of risks, having a strong initiative spirit at the proper time and place.
And to complete this portrait, Professor Çabej would continue with other features of
Albanians, noting that “his soul is mature, reserved, especially with the strangers,
but this reservation does not preclude the opened nature, the inborn skilfulness of
the resident of the mountains, and the individualist mark which in special cases
turns into wild stubborn attitude.” But above all, he cites unbridled pride, honesty as
“friend of the truth”.[16]

Among other features that complement the portrait of Albanian, are also the desire
for migration and the desire and longing for the left land, the insistence in life and
the power of the personality. Faced with the wild daily occupation of the country,
Barleti doesn’t forget to mention the Great War spirit of the Albanian, by ploughing
the field with one hand and holding a sword in the other hand. A special and beautiful
assessment for the Albanian is given in Glossary of conversation and reading, 1833,
when it’s written about Albanians: “Their value is their proverbial ... their value
makes them to earnestly be welcomed by the Turks,[17] who have started due to this
reason, to call them Arnaut. We note here that arnaodh in the Gallic language means
brave, courageous, deriving from naodh, which means “value”[18].

Albania and the Balkans, large numbers of people changed religion in the nineteenth century, by
becoming the Muslims.

_Albanian Stradiots and their historical contribution_

Very significant in this regard were the words of another distinguished French historian
_J.C.L. Sismonde de Sismondi, who, for the period 1454-1470, notes: “Albanians,_
Illyrians, were quite different from Greeks, refused to be harassed or taken up quietly
to work, but were energetic and courageous. (Venetian) Republic would have found
to them its best soldiers, the best sailors, if it had wanted to deal with full equality in
its armies and fleets.”[19] Researcher Edouard Laboulaye would say: “War (for them)
is the only tool that provides wealth and honour...Europe itself has been in her service
more than once; Mirdita has been serving the Naples and Austria, there was in France
at the time of Henry IV “[20] The monk Jean Claude Faveyrial, who wrote the first
“History of Albania”, talking about the qualities of the Albanians, says that under
Louis XIII, French missionaries who visited Albania “were seized by admiration to
this race which showed strong spirit, high stature, sharp features, decorated
weapons”.[21]

_Fifthly, the Albanian estradiote phenomenon is an expression of the ancient Albanian_
military which was perfected during the period of Scanderbeg, is a valuable
contribution to the martial European arts by introducing for the first time, tactics and
strategies of Albanian light cavalry, synthesized in two works of the general
commissioner of cavalry, Albanian Gjergj Basta, “On the governance of light cavalry”
(1612) and “The duties of the Joint Chiefs of Staff” (1606).

The Greek prominent orientalist N. Sathas, with more courage and fair, would exactly
point out that “their martial art was the foundation of the subsequent European strategy,
however odd it seems“[22] The contemporary scholar Nicholas C.J.Pappas sees
estradiots, “in the most part originating from Albania, as pioneers of light cavalry
tactics in modern European armies”[23] Aristidh Kola, mentioned among the great
stradiots, Merkur Buan and Manol Blesh, who like Marco Boçari centuries later,
studied the battles of Skanderbeg, and books for the Hero of Arbëria and of Epirus,
were generally among the most common among Albanian estradiots[24]. And it was
exactly the elite of his army, the Skenderbeyan guard, what possessed perfectly the
strategy and tactics of surprising war; she had known only victory for a quarter
century facing countless imperial Ottoman armies, which would become later
Albanian estradiot army spread across European West.

R.P. Daniel, of the Association of Jesus, in his History of the French Militia (1721),
gives this definition for stradiots: “In the light cavalry aspect they were e Militia ...
In France this Milita was called the Albanian light cavalry”[25], quotes chronicler De
_Brantôme, which states that King Louis XII appointed to Sir De Fontrailles the rank_

and position of the General Colonel of the albanoj under his service (2.000 troops
commanded by the Albanian Captain Merkur Bua) and that “they are the ones who
brought us the Light Cavalry, which by that time was not valued in France.” On the
other hand, Nobel De Langey says that they could be used in combat also as infantry
troops.

When explaining the term “lightly armed”, Father Daniel highlight the ancient origins
of the concept itself through the figure of Alexander the Great, armed just with a
spear and shield atop his horse (Chronicon Comariense an ad. 1.298).[26] But besides
the son of the Albanian woman Olimbia, the same thing can be said for Pirro of
Epirus, who introduced for the first time the light cavalry in the Roman empire, for
Scanderbeg and his Guard, part of which the hero himself gave as a gift to kingdom
of Naples, which indicates that Albanian light cavalry of all the times has been
excellent over centuries and it was therefore logical foundation of European
modernised light cavalry, one of the most valuable contributions of ancient Albanian
nation to European and world history.

_In conclusion, we can say that the period of the peak of Albanian estradiots, before,_
after and during Scanderbeg time, crowned in a way with the prominent Albanuaja,
the Albanian coat of arms of the middle Ages, held even by the King of France, is a
valuable contribution of the Albanian people in European history. This was made
possible by a resistance for a quarter of a century against the Ottoman Empire and
with the bloodshed by the Albanian stradiots for two centuries and “the flourishing
of the European Renaissance, reformation, exploration of the western world, where
would be housed later hundreds of thousands of his (Scanderbeg) offspring.[27]

We would like to conclude with the words of the great Albanian scholar Eqerem
Çabej: “The same as in ancient times, as well as in later periods, this strong
mountaineer nation sheds his blood for creation of new Balkan nations, not only by
ethnic mixture, but also in a political sense, as Balkan warrior caste, with gun in
hand” and further on, as the warrior caste spread throughout Europe with the
outstanding Albanian estradiots.

##### SHORT GUIDANCE
 FOR ‘MILITARY REVIEW’ RESEARCH PAPERS

**Dear contributors to the Military Review!**

“Military Review” is a research review focused on security and defense aspects. It is
the magazine of the AAF military elite and prominent civilian analysts, through their
research papers. The papers are not based only on information, but primarily, they
provide recommendations and solutions to the most important security and defense
issues, at the strategic and operational level. That means that the priority of the
Military Review are the applied values of the research papers.

With this purpose, we invite talented students of high military studies of Albanian
Defense Academy, instructors, lecturers, researchers, analysts, commanders, chiefs
and trainers of all institutions and units of the Albanian Armed Forces, and beyond,
independent analysts, civilian or military security and defense, to engage and organize
their community, creating highly valuable and respected research works.

In order to facilitate the efforts of the researchers, the Editorial Board of the Military
Review provides the following guidance and technical data on the structure of the
articles for the author (authors) of the Military Review, which should be respected
by all contributors.

**Structure of the Article**

**Title. Title of the article**

**The author, co-author(s): Name of the article’s author or co-author(s).**

**Short commentary: The short commentary is a summary of the article. It precedes**
the full article. It is a brief of about half a page or some 400-600 words of the main
findings of the article (such as, fundamental issues in the article, intentions of the
author’s view, conclusions or recommendations, etc.).

**Length: The main part of the article (including introduction and conclusions) written**
in Albanian/English should be 6-8 computer pages with a maximum of 15000-25000
characters, including “footnotes” and additional information.

**Format: Page must be A4: Type of script: “Times New Roman” size of font 11.**
Indent (new paragraph) is determined by a blank line. Presentation of the text is to be

simple and to a minimum of styles and formatting options. Paragraphs should not be
numbered; text should be a structure of 3 levels maximum. Highlighted bold text or
colored letters should be avoided. Writing steep and quotes should be used only for
quotations and literature sources used.

Graphs, tables and other images should be in-group formatted to avoid their
disintegration. They should be clear and closer to the text explaining them. All images
should be reflected in the way that readability is not affected by reducing the size
and black and white printers. If an image is taken from another source, it is essential
that the respective source is quoted.

Articles should be sent in printing format and electronically to the editorial board of
Military Review. For those items that do not meet the above requirements and language
format, the editorial staff decides to return to the authors for improvement, or to
exclude them from the submission process.

**Documentation: All contributors of the Military Review should respect all rights**
reserved policy and provide references and “footnote” throughout the article and
finally to identify all the literature used for the article. “Footnotes” should respect
the national and international rules correctly to include: surname, name (referring to
copyright), title of reference material, the name of the entity editor, publication place,
publication year, number of pages where it relates ISBN number, website where the
item is published. (E.g. SMITH, James Carl, Nowak, George. Security in the 21[st]
_Century: History unknown. 2[nd] edition. New York, London: Oxford University Press,_
_2006. 235 p. ISBN 0071448209, http://www. iir.cz / display.asp? LNG=uk & ida=)._

**Biography: Along with the article, the author should also send an electronic photo,**
and a short biography (CV) of about 100 words including: name, surname, military
and research degree, job position, education, research efforts, phone number and email.

**Style: Writing must present a simple structure, using titles and subtitles. It is important**
that the authors use, at the end of the article, conclusions and recommendations on
the key issues.

The article should not contain classified material and must apply the rules of classified
information. The article should not contain political positions or views on the issues
concerned. It must respect the research orientation of this review.
