## Foreword

The Military Strategy of Romania is a document, developed for the first time in the Romanian military practice, by which the Ministry of National Defense sets forth the strategic purpose of achieving the fundamental objective established by the President in the National Security Strategy and the provisions of the Defense White Book of the Government. The Armed Forces are and will be a fundamental institution for ensuring national security. This responsibility becomes all the more complex by keeping simultaneously an adequate combat potential and carrying out the restructuring processes considered so necessary. Romania's national security cannot be isolated from that of the rest of Europe. Romania will continue to be a provider of regional stability in a security en-viron-ment characterized by many uncertainties, as well as by predictable risks and those that can be total surprises. Within acceptable limits of risk, the military are capable of protecting and guaranteeing Romania's National Security. In order to implement this strategy, the Armed Forces will undergo a process of modernization aimed at manpower restructuring and providing it with modern combat equipment. The aim of this process is to establish Project Force 2005, which is to be more compact, efficient, effective, flexible and compatible with NATO standards. Such a force, when completely operational, will be capable of defending the interests of the Romanian state in the best possible way. The Armed Forces will develop international partnership and cooperative relations and will benefit from the experience gained in these activities. Our purpose is to enhance regional confidence, aiming at our integration. We are committed to contributing to this process, while being aware of the advantages of collective defense and security. The national military strategy acknowledges that the Romanian Armed Forces are and will be capable of repelling and if necessary, of defeating a possible military aggression, within the limits of our capabilities. The Romanian Armed Forces are prepared to promote the national interests, in compliance with the political decisions of the national command authorities, while not being perceived as a source of concern by other states.

## Introduction

The Military Strategy of Romania is the basic document of the Armed Forces, describing the fundamental objectives and options for carrying out, by military means and actions, the defense policy of the Romanian state. It stipulates the place and role of the Romanian Armed Forces within the efforts for achieving the objectives included in the National Security Strategy and in the Defense White Book of the Government on national security and defense. The Military Strategy represents the basic document, which serves as a guide to the activity of the Romanian Armed Forces in the first years of the next century. The primary task of our Armed Forces is to guarantee the strict observance of human rights for all Romanian citizens in a sovereign, independent, unitary and indivisible state, actively engaged into the process of European and Euro-Atlantic integration, by a political regime based on constitutional democracy, while keeping a strict political civilian control over the Armed Forces. To accomplish this mission, the military body is and will be subject exclusively to the Romanian people's will. Under such circumstances, the Romanian Armed Forces must be prepared to prevent, deter, and if necessary, defeat any aggressor that threatens and endangers the security of the Romanian state, simultaneously with providing the capability to participate in conflict prevention, crisis management and collective defense at regional level. The Military Strategy of Romania was developed upon the following basis: Romania has no stated enemies; it enjoys peaceful relations with its neighbors and the probability of an emerging major military short- and medium-term threat to our security, is minimal. The strategy is clearly an active - defensive one. The essence of the strategy includes four strategic concepts. The first concept - **CREDIBLE DEFENSIVE CAPABILITY,** implying a permanent capability to respond efficiently and properly to the current and predictable risks posed by the security environment. Based on a realistic assessment of risks, we must permanently maintain quantitatively sufficient and credible forces, trained according to modern standards. The second concept - **RESTRUCTURING AND MODERNIZATION** - consists first of all in the setting up of adequate structures, smaller, more compact and flexible, with the ability to quickly deploy and properly resourced to sustain the military effort, and second, the quality improvement of equipment, both by upgrading part of the available equipment, and by purchasing new one. This means both the supply with modern equipment and achievement of Project Force - 2005, a process which will include in a first stage (2000 - 2003) the reshaping of our Armed Forces and the establishment of the new force structure, the training of leaders, the formation of the professional personnel, the modernization and standardization of training. During this stage, only those acquisition programs, which have had specific funds allocated to them will be permitted to proceed, while the other acquisitions will be rescheduled. In the second stage (2004 - 2007) the emphasis will be placed on the modernization and acquisition of combat, support and protection equipment, specific to the battlefield of the 21st century. The third concept - **ENHANCED AND MORE OPERATIONAL PARTNERSHIP** - is based on specific, bilateral and multilateral partnerships and on developing some others supporting the strengthening of national security. The fourth concept - GRADUAL INTEGRATION - consists in accelerating the process of acceding to European and Euro-Atlantic military structures, based on the gradual interoperability of our Armed Forces with the armed forces of the Member States, which will allow Romania to take the desired and deserved position in the international community. An environment of collective security is the best means to protect our interests in the 21st century. 

## Security Environment

The threat of a major military conflict in Europe has significantly decreased. After the collapse of the communist regimes, Romania faces a transition period that presents both opportunities and challenges. Simultaneously with the progress of integration and cooperation, processes disturbing security, such as breaking up, putting aside or isolating international actors, take place. Lacking dialogue, conflicts tend to acquire an international character, entailing the use of military force and endangering the security of states, with serious consequences at regional and global levels. There is a commitment from all states participating in building European Security to increase cooperation, to strengthen stability and reduce the possibility of an armed conflict. The security environment presents the short-term opportunity to prepare for the integration into the North-Atlantic Alliance. Romania has clearly proved to be committed towards this aim. To put into practice this willingness of integration was and continues to constantly be one of our strategic objectives. Romania must revaluate this opportunity. Romania doesn't consider any state to be her possible enemy. At present there is a regional instability that may cause an increase of medium- and long -term risks. The spirit of openness, partnership and co-operation in Europe, contributes to strengthening the trend towards stability. The Romanian Armed Forces take an active part in developing co-operation with the military of other states in order to sustain enhanced confidence and stability. The current security environment provides an opportunity to reshape our armed forces within acceptable limits of risk. In an inconsistent, complex, dynamic and uncertain security environment, the current economical-financial conditions of Romania and of other states in the region, are a potential source of instability. They could delay the positive effects of regional evolution and could stress the negative tendencies. In this context, our Armed Forces must be prepared to properly meet the challenges of the 21st century, which can be particularly noticed within the area of Romania military strategic interest. This area varies with the evolution of security environment and national interests, and it is determined both by the existence of active or potential sources of generating major crises, whose settlement demands the use of Armed Forces, and the presence of opportunities to be attracted for promoting the national military objectives. Romania lies at the crossroads of four strategic evolutions within the following areas: 
- Central Europe - a future pole of regional prosperity; - South-Eastern Europe - a provider of instability; 

- Community of Independent States - currently undergoing an identity crisis and the Black Sea - 
an area of strategic importance for NATO Southern Flank, as well as a transit route for energetic resources from Central Asia.

## National Military Objectives

In order to achieve this fundamental objective, Romania's Military Strategy defines the following national military objectives:
- conflict prevention and crisis management which could directly affect the military security of Romania; 
- support of public authorities in civilian emergencies and by humanitarian actions; - prevent, deter and defeat any possible armed aggression against Romania; - enhance its contribution to regional stability by participating in conflict prevention, crisis management and collective defense, as well as in humanitarian actions; 
- gradual integration into NATO military structures. 

In order to promote and defend Romania's interests and to achieve the national security objectives, by the adequate use of military assets, we have to prevent, deter and defeat any possible aggression, individually or in cooperation with partners and future allies. At the same time, it is imperative to intensify the efforts to join NATO, to benefit from and take part in a collective defense. To be credible, the Armed Forces must become interoperable with NATO Armed Forces and have smaller, mobile, efficient and modern structures. By continuing current strategic, multilateral and bilateral partnerships and by developing some others, we will create favorable conditions to strengthen security in the region and will facilitate the modernization of the Armed Forces. Our Armed Forces will thus become a provider of regional stability and a contributor to peace and security in Europe. 

## Strategic Concepts

- Gradual and Flexible Response - Restructuring and Modernization - The Enhanced and More Operational Partnership - The Gradual Integration - Arms Control The strategic concepts are the main guidelines for the use of the Armed Forces in the implementation of our Military Strategy. They also define the way our Armed Forces will be organized, equipped and trained. These concepts are: credible defensive capability, restructuring and modernization, enhanced operational partnership and gradual integration. Credible defensive capability. The Romanian Armed Forces must maintain a permanent capability to effectively and adequately respond to risks generated by the security environment. A *gradual and flexible response*, including a combination of simultaneous or sequential actions, using surveillance and early warning forces, as well as crisis operations forces, main and reserve forces, provides an adequate response to threats. It includes four stages: Early Warning: specialized peacetime forces, deployed in the neighborhood of the border areas and in the depth of the national territory, provide surveillance and early warning capability. Their purpose is to participate in preventing strategic surprise, to discover and monitor any indication related to the emergence and development of crisis and conflict situations or the danger of breaking out an armed aggression against Romania. Rapid Reaction. It is achieved by promptly starting the specific procedures envisaged by the agreements on confidence - building measures, arms control, regional cooperation, consultations within Partnership for Peace and mechanisms included in the UN Charter. If the threats increase, emphasizing the imminent danger of hostile actions, the deployment of forces should be carried out immediately and adequately. The military will have available immediate zone engagement forces and rapid reaction forces, capable of promptly responding to any type of military aggression. Their action will be based on a special responsiveness and it will be timely, selective, dynamic and flexible. Depending on the scope of threat, part of the main forces may be called to support the actions conducted by the Rapid Reaction Force. In well-defined situations, in accordance with the objectives of foreign policy and the international commitments of our state, the Romanian Armed Forces should be capable to prepare, deploy and support the participation of forces in peace support operations, aiming at solving crisis situations affecting the Romanian national interests or those of the international community. In case of a large-scale military aggression against Romania or against a partner state or a group of states, which the Romanian state committed herself to support, the Romanian Armed Forces should be capable of participating in joined and combined operations in compliance with the collective defense principles and with the provisions of the new NATO Strategic Concept. They should also be able to carry out the commitments undertaken to international organizations, in case of participating in peace support operations, according to NATO and/or UN Standard Operating Procedures. Under such circumstances, the Romanian Armed Forces should have available operational forces able to be deployed anywhere inside the national territory and within Romania's area of strategic interest, as well as forces capable of conducting territory defense operations and of providing the national support for the projection and deployment of partner (allied) forces. General Armed Defense. In extreme situations, the generalized armed defense will be adopted. The National Defense System and the country's every human and material resources will be mobilized to repel the enemy force. Under the general armed defense, the Armed Forces should be able to defeat the armed aggression taking place on the national territory at strategic and operational levels. The enemy will be engaged in depth in order to reduce its offensive combat potential. Operations outside our national territory will be conducted to prevent continued aggression and to deprive the aggressor of the possibility of resuming immediately the offensive action.

## Restructuring And Modernization

The main guideline in this field is, on one hand, the setting up of new structures of management, combat, combat support and logistic support, which are organizationally modern, mobile, flexible and having a high deployment and protection capability and sustainability, an increased firepower and are able to carry out multiple missions, while on the other hand, the procurement of adequate equipment for the military. We should reconsider the role of the information component as compared to the energetic one in case of an armed conflict. The purpose of modernization consists in providing an efficient, smaller in size, active, strong force, adequate to the new security environment and also able to conduct a timely response. The modernization is based on four major elements:

## - **Restructuring The Force**

http://english.mapn.ro/milstrategy/concepts.php (2 of 6)4/21/2005 11:32:56 AM
The future military force of Romania is defined as Project Force - 2005. This force will consist of *112,000 military personnel and 28,000 civilians*. Commands, combat forces, combat support and logistic forces will be reorganized. The number of professional military personnel will increase from 47% to 71%. Commands and forces will be composed of carefully designed structures, which are compact, highly effective, efficient, flexible, compatible with NATO standards and interoperable with the Alliance armed forces. The operational units will be maintained at a high level of readiness. The territorial and reserve forces will be manned, trained and kept at a level of readiness adequate to the needs of providing territorial defense, national support and mobilization. In our security environment, the quality of forces, their ability, the decisive character of response and their adaptability are much more important than their size.

## - **Management Of The Personnel To Be Discharged, And Of The Excessive Equipment** Holdings And Infrastructure

The composition of the Project Force - 2005 will be precisely established. This imposes the identification and definition of each and every assignment according to rank, specialty and necessary equipment. The personnel, equipment and infrastructure placed outside these structures will be managed in accordance with laws and the personnel and procurement policies. Starting with 2000, this personnel will have an active reserve status. This will provide, on one hand, the ability to make it react to an unforeseen deterioration of the security environment and, on the other hand, will provide the personnel with the time required for its integration into the civil society. By reshaping the military body, excessive infrastructure will result and according to the situation, legal action undertaken in order to render it profitable, will be presented to national authorities.

## - **The Professionalization Of Force**

The main element of the military generating strength and will is the man himself. The native fighter skills of the Romanian people are a guarantee for the short-term professionalization of the Armed Forces. The present conscription system based on the compulsory military service as well as on the alternative military service, is an expensive way of manning. First priority surveillance, early warning and crisis response units must include professional soldiers who are willing to devote part of their life to military service. Conscription will be used to man our main defense forces. Starting with 2000, the number of conscripts to be called up will meet the requirements of manning Project Force - 2005.

## - **Equipment Procurement**

Our procurement program must be reasonable and selective throughout the next five years. The stress will be laid on maintaining the main current procurement programs which are a prerequisite for modernizing the equipment starting with 2004. Only the procurement required to maintain adequate equipment for the forces and to perform the transition to Project Force - 2005 will be made. All other materiel modernization programs will be re-scheduled until 2005. The re-scheduling will not affect the C4I (command, control, communications, computers and information) development program at all echelons, which is already a fully funded program.

## The Enhanced And More Operational Partnership

The system of partnership is currently the best way to prepare the Romanian Armed Forces for integration into a collective security environment. We will actively develop our military relations with NATO member states, using mainly the opportunities offered by the Partnership for Peace, the Strategic Partnership with USA and by the special Partnerships developed with United Kingdom, Germany, France and Italy. Besides, we shall enhance bilateral cooperation with candidate countries for NATO membership and with the other states capable of supporting our efforts to join the North Atlantic Alliance. Within bilateral and multilateral cooperation, our Armed Forces will participate in Combined Joint Task Force exercises and multinational peace support operations. First, we shall contribute with units nominated for peacekeeping, support and service support and with officers, who are experts in civil-military relations. Through these partnerships developed by our Armed Forces, we are able to continue improving our crisis management system. Within the subregional cooperation, we will take an active part in:
- the Multinational Peace Force - South-Eastern Europe (MPF-SEE) together with Albania, Bulgaria, FYROM, Greece, Italy and Turkey;
- the Central-European Cooperation Initiative (CENCOOP), together with Austria, Switzerland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Hungary;
- the Multinational Stand-by High Readiness Brigade (SHIRBRIG); the Black Sea Naval Cooperation Group (BLACKSEAFOR) - to include Bulgaria, Georgia, Russian Federation, Turkey and Ukraine.

## The Gradual Integration

For the purpose of achieving national security objectives, Romania must get integrated into Euro- Atlantic and European institutions and enhance its role in other security structures. NATO integration is the first priority and it is the best option for Romania to advance towards a collective security environment. o NATO Integration. The Washington Summit gave a new dimension to NATO enlargement by promoting the concept of Membership Action Plan. The Romanian Armed Forces are firmly committed to executing the military requirements of their national program. In this respect, the main courses of action of our Armed Forces are the following:
- the achievement of the objectives established in the annual national programs for integration; - the full engagement in the Operational Partnership for Peace; - the approach to security issues and the process of defense planning according to the new NATO strategic concept;
- the gradual increasing of our participation in joint structures and actions, mainly in strategic and operational planning, command, control, communications and information systems, airspace defense management, training and infrastructure systems, as well as in coordinating movements;
- provide actual capabilities for collective defense and for the implementation of other measures taken by the Alliance;
- the achievement of standardization and interoperability.

Within the framework of NATO partnership cooperation, Romania supports the development of the European Security and Defense Identity (ESDI). This constitutes an important element of the Romanian integration policy, representing a tool in approaching and dealing with the future regional challenges. We intend to support and participate in planned crisis management exercises, response operations included, in Peace Support Operations (PSOs), search and rescue and humanitarian assistance operations. o OSCE and United Nations. We will continue to participate in peace support operations. Our participation in this type of operations will prove that Romania is fully committed to building up the new regional and European security architecture. Our participation will be based upon the impact on our national interests. Especially in OSCE, we will strongly support preventive diplomacy, conflict prevention and post conflict rehabilitation initiatives of the European states. Commitments will be turned to facts by the participation of the Romanian Armed Forces in the military cooperation initiatives for the establishment of multinational military forces, designated especially to conduct peace-keeping and humanitarian missions, under UN or OSCE mandate.

## Arms Control

Arms control plays an important part in our integration strategy. Romania is party to several international arms control treaties, which have contributed significantly to lowering the tensions in Europe and to limiting the spread of conventional arms and weapons of mass-destruction. The priorities in this stage aim at strengthening and developing measures in order to enhance confidence and transparency in Central and Eastern Europe, and also the efficiency of bilateral and regional agreements, as well as to contribute to solving tensions and conflicts in the vicinity of Romania (former - Yugoslav area, the European part of the former-Soviet area). A basic task is the implementation of the Adapted CFE Treaty, representing one of the fundamental elements of the new European security architecture. We also support and contribute to other arms control initiatives, while aiming at strengthening the national verification capabilities. 

## Strategic Principles

The major task of the Romanian Armed Forces is to promote and protect the vital national interests, to defend and guarantee the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and unity of the Romanian state, the constitutional democracy and the principles of the rule of law. The Armed Forces are also called upon to maintain Romania's freedom of action in the relations developed with other states, to provide Romania's active participation in crisis management and to support local authorities in civil emergencies (natural disasters, industrial accidents and other contingencies). According to current fundamental political-military options of the Romanian state and to national traditions, Romania's Military Strategy is based on the principle of non-aggression and it has a prevailing defensive and active character, this in keeping with the foreign policy objectives of the Romanian state. Consequently, Romania will employ the elements of military power especially within its area of strategic interest, in order to support, defend and promote national interests as directed by the national command authority. The Armed Forces are subordinated and will respond to the civilian democratic leadership of the state. The legal framework of the Constitution establishes the democratic civilian control of the Armed Forces by the political leadership of the state - the Parliament, the President, the Supreme Council of National Defense, the Government - and the strategic decision-making procedures. Employing the military in the defense of our country is a political decision adopted by the leadership of Romania. The defense policy and the budgetary process are transparent and conducted according to Parliament's decisions. Until the integration into the North-Atlantic Alliance, the Military Strategy is based on the principle of credible defensive capabilities, achieved mainly by national effort. The military security gap will be covered by the participation to Partnership for Peace with the North Atlantic Alliance, strategic and special partnerships, bilateral agreements, as well as by other security arrangements with different states. The Strategy directs the military towards a force having enhanced capabilities, able to undertake maneuver and decisive action. Such a force serves Romania's interests best because it facilitates our active participation in international security structures and adapts quickly in order to prevent regional crises from turning into conflicts. At the same time, it forms the best foundation for the defense of our state by own forces or in a multinational structure, in the event we are attacked. Developments in the strategic concepts of warfare, the increasing complexity of the modern battlefield and the technological progress require Armed Forces capable of conducting military operations within a joint doctrine at strategic and operational levels. Under certain circumstances, especially when participating in multinational operations, this principle may be applied at the level of tactical echelons as well. In order to accomplish these tasks, the Alliance principles are still considered essential, as regards: allied solidarity, strategic unity, the equitable sharing of roles, risks and responsibilities, collective defense effort, multinational financing, support of developing ESDI and credible deterrence. 

## Strategic Missions

The strategic missions of the Armed Forces are based upon the defense policy objectives and its priorities, the strategic principles, the decisions taken by the authorized bodies and also upon the development of the internal and international security environment. According to the security environment, missions are grouped as follows: 
- peacetime missions; - missions in crisis situations; - at war.

In peacetime, the Armed Forces must provide a credible defensive capability based upon organization, procurement, training and cooperation.

## The **Main Strategic Missions** Are:

- establishment of forces to achieve a response at a planned level according to the objectives set out and the allotted resources;
- prevention of conflicts or participation in conflict prevention and aggression; - preparation of the population, economy and territory for defense and national support to multinational operations;
- achievement of the military component of the Membership Action Plan with a view to achieving interoperability and standardization objectives, as well as partnership and integration objectives;
- cooperation for training within the framework of Partnership for Peace and according to bi-and multinational agreements concluded with other states;
- participation in peace support and humanitarian missions; - support of public authorities in a civilian emergency, natural and other types of disasters.

Relating to the character of the crisis (internal or international) directly affecting Romania, the Armed Forces may participate, according to legal provisions and in cooperation with other legal state institutions, in the following actions: provide logistical support to the Ministry of Interior and local public authorities; prevent destabilizing actions; defeat terrorist and other illegally armed elements; control access to certain objectives of strategic importance; prevent proliferation of conventional arms and weapons of mass destruction; intervention for the protection of citizens and basic infrastructure; monitoring and warning strategically in depth by our specialized forces; achieve strategic security at the borders and of vital importance objectives; stop arms and ammunition traffic; confine and clear effects of disasters. The armed forces will be engaged in these types of actions according to government and local plans (regional, departmental); it will have a gradual and flexible character and will be carried out only after making the population aware of the dangers and the necessity of using the armed forces. The military will only use the forces committed for such actions, being adequately equipped. The military will provide support in case of natural disasters, at the request of central and local authorities. To this effect the armed forces will establish the required bodies, which will co-operate with the civil protection forces and the local public administration. In certain cases, based on the decision made by the national command authorities, the military may also participate in this type of operations outside the national borders, their aim being to confine and alleviate the effects of disasters. The participation in regional crisis management and response missions (which may be conducted also in peacetime) will be carried out only after the national command authorities approve these actions and the adequate funds are allocated to them. The military involvement will be stopped in a flexible and gradual manner, in order to prevent the crisis breaking out again. The military forces will cease their operation, as soon as the responsible civil authorities are able to maintain control. In multinational operations, Romania will transfer the command authority of its units to the multinational force commander, in compliance with the common agreed procedures, approved by Romania's Parliament. At war, the missions assigned to the armed forces are established in keeping with the declared political objective and after the strategic situation was estimated. The national command authorities establish the political objective. To achieve it we may face enemies, starting from those using simple technologies in a new way, and up to those using high tech and a large quantity of information. This range of potential conflicts is a challenge, requiring a force capable of mounting a rapid response. This means a force having a higher organization, doctrine and training, with modern combat equipment and an effective action potential. At war, the armed forces, by their organization and conduct of decisive response actions, should repel the enemy military actions and create favourable conditions for making or enforcing peace according to the interests of the Romanian state and strictly in accordance with the situation established by the national command authorities for ceasing military operations. The violent conflicts will be in the information and high tech fields or the war will be conducted in all fields, rather than between armed forces possessing large quantities of equipment and personnel. The share of quantitative and energetic factors will continually diminish in favour of the qualitative and information ones. The success of the Romanian Armed Forces in a future military conflict will depend on:
- *avoidance of being taken by surprise, especially in the information field;* - *capability of conducting an efficient response;* - *active cooperation with partner (allied) forces;* - *timely activation of reserve forces;* - *a professional way of conducting joint operations;* - *active defense;* - *complete protection of their own forces.* 

## Command And Control Of The National Defense System Forces

The (political-military) command of the armed forces is the responsibility of the National Command Authorities (the Parliament, the President of Romania, the Supreme Council of National Defense, the Government, the Ministry of National Defense and public administration authorities having responsibilities in the national defense field). The President of Romania is the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and also the Head of the Supreme Council of National Defense - an institution responsible for organizing and coordinating the activities of national defense. Based on the decisions made by the national command authorities, at strategic level, the General Staff is responsible of the operational and military command of the Armed Forces and of the operations carried out by it. TheSupreme Council of National Defense conducts the unitary coordination of these types of activities and actions. The National Military Command Center is in charge with the current operational command of military actions in peacetime and in crisis situations (The Operational Center for Crisis Situations). In special situations, the General Headquarters is established by decision of the Supreme Council of National Defense , for the conduct of major military operations. The Joint Task Force Headquarters, the Air Force and Naval Force Operational Commands and the territorial operational commands conduct the military actions at operational level. For the conduct of special military actions with a highly independent character or/and carried out in areas with distinct features, joint operational headquarters at division level have been set up. The Joint Task Force Headquarters and tactical commands should be capable of carrying out operations anywhere on the national territory as well as in Romania's area of strategic interest, as part of combined joint forces. The conduct of the process of organization, procurement and training of forces, of the process of logistical and administrative support of troops and also the current operational conduct of territorial military operations are performed by the armed services staffs, which in peacetime will have in their subordination all combat, combat support and logistical structures. In crisis situations or in operations carried out outside the borders of our country, the armed services will provide the Joint Task Force Headquarters or the tactical operational commands with the forces necessary to fulfil the missions assigned by the General Staff. The territorial commands are responsible for the protection of the Romanian territory, provide the training of the main and reserve forces and turning from peace time to war by gradually raising the combat readiness and directly by mobilization. The conduct of joint operations requires the improvement of the capabilities necessary for the continuous collection, processing and use of information. The conduct of forces requires the presence of C4I system at all echelons. These systems should provide, under the circumstances of special dynamic military actions and of fluidity of disposition lines, command possibilities in the whole area of responsibility of operational commands, as well as the command and control in real time of the available forces and assets. At peace, in crisis situations and at war, the command of the Ministry of National Defense is conducted by the Minister who is its representative with the other ministries and governmental bodies, as well as with other public administration authorities and similar bodies of other states. The Chief of the General Staff, the highest military authority, is the main military adviser to the President, the Supreme Council of National Defense and the Minister of National Defense, being responsible for the military command of the Armed Forces. To carry out these responsibilities, the Chief of the General Staff is advised by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In emergency situations, in case of a threat against the national security or the constitutional democracy, the Ministry of National Defense organizes and conducts activities for logistic support to the Ministry of Interior, if requested. In case of a forthcoming disaster, the General Staff organizes and conducts - according to plans of cooperation/intervention and to steps established by the Governmental Commission for Disaster Relief - the participation of armed forces with forces and assets in confining and alleviating the effects of natural disasters and accidents. In siege situations, the Ministry of National Defense is the main responsible body for coordinating the implementation of steps taken in the decision declaring this status. The General Staff through the National Military Command Center (Operational Center for Crisis Situations) exercises the practical conduct of military actions. At the territorial level, in each county (and in the capital city), following a decision made by the National Defense Supreme Council, a military commander will be appointed. The responsibilities of the military commander are established in peacetime by the General Staff and are approved in a decision made by the National Defense Supreme Council. The organizational structure of headquarters in peacetime and at war, and the standard operating procedures (SOPs) of establishing the concepts, plans and documents for implementing them will be similar to NATO SOPs. This process aims at improving the military command and control at all levels and at establishing the conditions for achieving interoperability with similar NATO and WEU structures. 

## Risk Factors

The risk of a major military conflict remains low. However, there are regional and local, non-military and military risks difficult to be foreseen, which could evolve into threats. They are categorized into regional, asymmetric, transnational risks and unpredictable hazards. Regional risks include:
- strategic imbalance in military capability within Romania's area of strategic interest; - military conflicts and tensions which could extend; - standing economical-social shortcomings directly affecting military capability and depreciating the authority of national leadership institutions of our state; 
- the possibility of disrupting financial, information, energy, communications and telecommunications of the states systems, and the political-military rivalries between them. 

Asymmetric risks include strategies or deliberately undertaken actions against the Romanian state, using methods different from classical combat, aiming at attacking vulnerable fields of civil society which may directly or indirectly affect the armed forces as well; they are as follows:
- expansion of terrorist networks and activities; - uncontrolled proliferation and dissemination of nuclear technology and materials, weapons of mass destruction, proliferation of armaments and other lethal, unconventional means, information warfare; 
- Romania's isolation within the global community based on information, because it does not have specific infrastructure. Such risks include the breaking off of critical information flow, the presentation of a distorted image of the Romanian democratic society and observance of international treaties and agreements, the limitation of access to strategic resources, degradation of environment and the presence of high level risk objectives in the very proximity of the national boundaries. 

Transnational risks, by definition, are not confined by national boundaries. Groups that promote separatism or extremism, may generate some of these new threats. Others can originate from ethnic disputes, religious rivalries and violation of human rights. Organized crime, smugling of illegal drugs, arms and strategic materials bring about new risks. Recent events demonstrate the negative consequences of a massive flow of refugees. Unpredictable hazards are the risks resting in the unknown field of uncertainty and they are based on objective and subjective elements. The existing good international relations could change or worsen. The region is also prone to natural disasters: floods, drought and earthquakes. It is extremely important to assess the consequences of risks to national security, in the field of defense. If these risks are not identified, defined or countered in due time, they may have consequences occurring isolated or most certainly cumulated: mention should be made of the following: 
- Romania's loss of credibility, as a country firmly committed to European and Euro-Atlantic integration; rendering the leadership and executive political, economical-financial and military systems disorganized at national level or in certain operational areas, implying the partial or total exclusion of the country from the regional and world flow of information; 
- the failure of the reform process, the decrease of standard of life under the bearable limits and the diminishing of the biological potential of human resources; 
- lowering of the population's state of mind and confidence in the decision-makers; domestic unrest with a direct effect on Romania's democratic stability; 
- decrease of the armed forces' combat readiness and compromising of the military's credibility as a force to prevent, deter and annihilate possible aggressions; 
- the limitation in time and space of the armed forces' responsiveness in crisis and in war time; - prejudice of national independence and sovereignty with direct effects on the maintenance of the unity and territorial integrity of the Romanian state.

To mitigate the effects of risks, firm and timely measures are required to be taken. Their postponement will only increase risks and raise the cost of future actions. In order to properly respond to the entire spectrum of risks we must have in due time the required forces with a high level of readiness. According to their structure, equipment and training, the Romanian Armed Forces are not prepared to counter the economic-social risks and they have limited capabilities to counter the asymmetric and transnational risks. Based on the decision of the national command authority, the Armed Forces will cooperate with the other elements of the national defense system, specialized in fighting against these risks. 

## National Military Objectives

In order to achieve this fundamental objective, Romania's Military Strategy defines the following national military objectives:
- conflict prevention and crisis management which could directly affect the military security of Romania; 
- support of public authorities in civilian emergencies and by humanitarian actions; - prevent, deter and defeat any possible armed aggression against Romania; - enhance its contribution to regional stability by participating in conflict prevention, crisis management and collective defense, as well as in humanitarian actions; 
- gradual integration into NATO military structures. 

In order to promote and defend Romania's interests and to achieve the national security objectives, by the adequate use of military assets, we have to prevent, deter and defeat any possible aggression, individually or in cooperation with partners and future allies. At the same time, it is imperative to intensify the efforts to join NATO, to benefit from and take part in a collective defense. To be credible, the Armed Forces must become interoperable with NATO Armed Forces and have smaller, mobile, efficient and modern structures. By continuing current strategic, multilateral and bilateral partnerships and by developing some others, we will create favorable conditions to strengthen security in the region and will facilitate the modernization of the Armed Forces. Our Armed Forces will thus become a provider of regional stability and a contributor to peace and security in Europe. 

## Structural Organization Of Project Force - 2005

The military capabilities should meet the requirements of achieving the whole range of strategic missions, including those organized in peacetime and at war. In order to face the challenges against our national security in the next decade, the Romanian Armed Forces should use both their peacetime active forces and those to be augmented and mobilized. The Romanian Armed Forces functionally include operational, territorial and reserve forces. The Operational Forces include Army mechanized, tank, artillery, mountain troops, air mobile, Air Force, air defense, and Navy formations and units, fully manned and adequately equipped and trained. In crisis and at war, they should be able to be subordinated to operational commands, aimed at setting up groups of forces necessary for conducting military actions both inside our national territory and abroad within multinational forces. The Territorial and Reserve Forces will include formations and units from each Service. They are meant for conducting territorial defense, training and mobilization, as well as for supporting local authorities in civil emergencies. In crisis situations they may take part in active structures subordinated to the Joint Task Force Headquarters, for accomplishing the missions assigned to them. At war, after their augmenting / mobilization and an intensive combat training, the territorial forces may conduct actions, according to the situation, being either subordinated to the Joint Task Force Headquarters or to the Territorial Commands. As far as action is concerned, the armed forces include: Surveillance and Early Warning Forces, Crisis Situations Response Forces, Main Forces and Reserve Forces. The operational category, in which each of these structures is included, determines the priorities of the respective unit in distributing resources, personnel, equipment and training. It is highly required to achieve a balance in the armed forces, between the first priority units having a high readiness, and the forces having a reduced and variable readiness, representing most of the forces necessary for war. The Surveillance and Early Warning Forces include specialized structures, directly subordinated both to the General Staff, other central bodies of the Ministry of National Defense, and to other armed services. They include reconnaissance and electronic warfare units and subunits, intelligence structures, as well as those used for C4I systems, and small, modular and mobile combat units. They are responsible for the identification of forthcoming military conflicts and crises, the management of the factors conducting to the increase of threats against the national security, as well as for preventing surprise. These forces are, generally, in permanent combat readiness. The Crisis Situations Response Forces are responsible for the participation in crisis management, as well as for conducting the first response in case of an armed conflict. They participate in the efforts of achieving our military strategic objectives in peacetime and they are the main deterrent element. These forces will be deployed as to provide operational capability in the main directions and zones of the areas of operation. The forces acting in crisis situations include:
- Immediate Reaction Forces; - Rapid Reaction Force; - commands, formations and units nominated in the Individual Partnership Program.

The Rapid Reaction Force will include formations and units of all armed services, capable to act both independently and jointly. According to the decisions made by the National Command Authorities, a part of the reaction forces will be used within multinational structures in order to prevent conflicts, manage crises, and in other international missions conducted under the aegis of UN and OSCE. The participant forces will have an adequate size, acting and deployment capabilities, as well as logistic support. The Main Forces include peacetime formations and units, most of them manned only partially. Though the basic personnel will include standing personnel, a significant percentage will be covered by conscripts. These forces will become operational at war only after being manned with human and material resources and after an adequate period of intensive combat training. In certain crisis situations, if the threat is escalated in a very short time, the active elements in their structure may be included in the group of forces meant for crisis management. The Reserve Forces include formations and units established at mobilization. They have Commands, Training Centers and other units provided with structures and centers strictly necessary for working in peacetime. These centers establish, at mobilization, combat, combat service and logistics formations and units. The Main Forces and Reserve Forces achieve the combat capability after their manning / establishment and intensive training. Structurally, the Romanian Armed Forces consist of:
- **Land Forces** - **Air Forces and** - **Naval Forces.**
For conducting special missions, both at the central and at each armed service level, **Special Forces** are established. These forces are the ones that initiate, develop and manage special operations in the area under the control of the aggressor. The **Land Forces** are the basic component of the armed forces and are responsible for conducting the whole range of land and air mobile military actions in any area and in any direction independently or jointly with the other armed services, including defensive and offensive operations and actions in order to seize or annihilate the enemy who penetrated the national territory acting both within the national and multinational military structures. The operational structures will include 8 combat brigades, 4 combat support and 2 logistic brigades. Part of the units included in the operational structure should be able to conduct actions outside the national territory, within multinational groups of forces. The mobilization and reserve structures will include **10 combat, 5 combat support and 2 logistic brigades.** The **Air Force**s are meant to defend state sovereignty within our national airspace, independently or in cooperation with the other armed services, as well as within groups of multinational forces, in order to gain and maintain control over the air space and to support from the air the land or maritime forces engaged in military actions. They will be mainly included in the category of surveillance or reaction forces. The active forces will have an operational command, **2 air division commands, 4 air bases and 2** air defense brigades. Their reserve forces will include 2 air bases and 2 - 3 airfields. The Naval Forces are meant to conduct military actions independently or in cooperation with other armed services, or within a multinational group of forces, in the maritime, river or land space of national interest, in order to: defend our own maritime and river communications; provide access to sea for Romania; secure our state legal rights within the exclusive economic area; hit enemy naval communications; deny the landing of maritime troops; defend Dobrudja; execute peacekeeping and humanitarian missions. The structures will be included especially in the category of surveillance or rapid reaction forces and will be structured into an operational command, a **Maritime Fleet, a River Flotilla and other** forces. The Maritime Fleet provides the protection and defense of the seacoast, of the territorial waters, as well as the protection of goods and interests of the Romanian state within the maritime space having a regime of exclusive economic area (or similar). The operational forces of the **Maritime Fleet** should be able to provide an active presence in the international waters of the Black Sea for the protection of the interests of the Romanian state or international laws independently or in cooperation with the allied/partner forces. The naval units of the Maritime Fleet should be able to take part in combined peace support operations, within multinational groups of forces in the area of strategic interest for Romania, as well as to provide a limited presence in other areas in keeping with the commitments undertaken in the Partnership for Peace (integration into the North - Atlantic Alliance).

The **River Flotilla** provides the guard and defense of the Danube Delta, of the maritime and inner Danube, as well as the protection of the Romanian state interests within the border waters. 

## Concept Of Training And Operations Of The Armed Forces

The training of the armed forces includes two main components: the education and professional development of the service men in the military education system and the combat training of the military structures. The education system of officers and NCOs is so conceived as to provide a high management, technical and special training, and is supplemented with the system of training professional sergeants and privates, and with the system of evaluating civilians. Special emphasis will be laid on sending as many as possible officers to attend foreign colleges, schools and training establishments (including foreign languages). The NATO/PfP Regional Training Center hosted by Romania will teach the personnel NATO procedures, both at tactical and joint levels. The place and role of the NCOs in the professional structure of the armed forces will be reshaped. NCOs shall be commanders of military structures at the basis of military hierarchy (crew, squad, platoon), instructors, staff, technical and administrative specialists. The combat training of the armed forces has as a general aim to reach at an increased capability to enable commands and troops to perform military actions independently, jointly, in cooperation with the other armed services of the national defense system, as well as within coalitions and alliances. The combat training of the component elements will have certain specific features, according to their place within the armed forces structure. The combat training of the Surveillance and Early Warning Forces will be carried out simultaneously with the basic missions assigned to them, according to the service and branch to which they belong. Crisis Situations Response Forces will be trained in the same way. During the preparation phase for their participation in multinational operations, they will attend a specific training for each mission. The military structures which are fully manned and are included in the Main Forces will be trained to carry out combat missions simultaneously with the Rapid Reaction Forces or after a short period of time, determined by the duration of manning up to the war requirements and after a period of intensive combat training. The military structures having reduced personnel will train only the standing personnel, while carrying out activities specific to increase the combat readiness by mobilization. The Reserve Forces carry out command training, simultaneously with the activities meant for implementing mobilization plans. For the reservists included in their own plans, the military structures which are mobilized organize training call-ups or concentrations. The main characteristic of the training process of our armed forces will be the standardization of the basic training at a maximum possible level for each armed service. A special attention will be given to specific matters, staff procedures and the use of combat equipment while emphasizing the use of C4I system in carrying out missions. A prioritary task in the training will be the professionalization of personnel according to national and NATO standards. The military personnel will be trained in order to maintain the skills required in the use of combat equipment for accomplishing their missions. Gradually the number of live fire exercises executed in the firing ranges will be increased, as well as the time allocated for driving vehicles, flying, maritime and river navigation. The training will be oriented for the increase of the operational readiness of the troops. The surveillance and early warning units should identify and react adequately to the first signs of a deterioration of domestic or foreign situation. The Rapid Reaction Forces will improve their capabilities in order to be able to move fast by all available means from the garrisons where they are stationed. They will develop and train their capability of conducting operations in a coherent, joint and quick way. The armed forces will observe the established operational standards. The surveillance and early warning forces, as well as the forces acting in crisis situation will be staffed at least 90% (for the air force the ratio will be 2 : 1 crew/ aircraft). The allocation of combat equipment to the units will be not less than 90% of their requirements. The standard for operational combat capability will be 80%. In order to provide the training requirements, not less than 80% of the necessary resources will be allotted. As the necessary resources will be achieved, the operational standards will be raised as high as possible, starting with the Immediate and Rapid Reaction Forces, which are prioritary. The **Concept of Engagement of the Romanian Armed Forces in crisis and war situations** is based on the principles, strategic concepts, missions and capabilities of the armed forces and, in perspective, of the Project Force - 2005. It includes the ways and succession of using our forces in order to accomplish the objective(s) established by the national command authorities. The gradual transition from peace to war should be done in advance, in a sufficient time for activating resources, rendering structures effective and rendering forces operational, related to the evolution of threats and the existence of dangers. In crisis situations, according to the mission assigned, the armed forces will engage only those forces that are necessary to solve the crisis, while keeping their own freedom of action in order to react against an escalation. The participation of the Romanian Armed Forces in peacekeeping operations will be carried out according to the provisions of the joint military doctrine and strategy, as well as to the provisions of the agreed common operational strategy (doctrine). At war, the concept of engagement of the armed forces will aim at fixing and repelling the enemy by using our rapid reaction forces, while hitting deep the enemy's vital objectives (in order to reduce enemy's offensive capability). The technological gap implies the use of unconventional combat techniques, which represents the asymmetrical response strike conducted in the areas conquered by aggression. Thus, conditions will be created for the decisive engagement of our main forces and, in cooperation with the other elements of the National Defense System, for achieving a favorable final result, according with the situation envisaged by the national command authorities for concluding operations. When participating in military operations within multinational groups the engaged troops of Romania's Armed Forces will be organized and conducted in compliance with the rules of engagement and with the agreed common operational plans, under the command of the military authorities established upon agreement. The national command will exert its authority on personnel, jurisdiction and discipline as well as its responsibilities concerning equipment, logistical support, medical and spiritual (religious) assistance. The interconnection between the Armed Forces and civil environment (both governmental and nongovernmental) where the actions are carried out, is important for the success of operations. Civilmilitary cooperation is interdependent: the military assets are more and more required to help civil authorities; the civil support for military operations is also important to logistics, communications, medical aid and public relations.

## Logistics

Logistics should adapt its capabilities to the aims and objectives included in the military strategy, by establishing its priorities necessary to provide an adequate, dynamic and timely support of the forces. The logistic system should provide freedom of action both in peacetime and crisis situation or war time. It should be flexible and mobile to support the participation of our forces in new types of commitments / multinational peace support missions. To this end, we shall modernize our logistic system, having in view the following objectives:
- to become integrated, with a modular structure, interoperable with the logistic system of modern armed forces of NATO member states, in order to provide an initial autonomy of units, in accordance with their place in the operational structure (in the Surveillance and Early Warning Forces, in the Crisis Situations Response Forces, in the Main Forces or the Reserve Forces); 
- to provide a high degree of efficiency, flexibility and a capability of modular adaptability in support of forces, according to the various tasks assigned to them; 
- to achieve a centralized planning and a decentralized execution conception in order to provide the logistic support required for conducting operations planned; 
- to be carried out within the national territory and in the area of strategic interest; - to develop logistic computing system comparable to that of NATO; - to eliminate parallel and overlapping tasks in logistics between the armed services, commands and central directorates; 
- to give up the preventive planned principle on repair of combat equipment of the Armed Forces and to apply the maintenance system according to necessities and based on diagnosis; 
- to involve civilian commercial agencies in fulfilling tasks of the logistic components. 

The adaptation of the logistic system to the new force structure and its modernization will provide the necessary material and assistance conditions for achieving the military strategic objectives. 

## Resources Of Armed Defense

This includes the personnel, financial, technological, scientific, material and other means, which will be allocated by state to prepare the armed defense of our country. They determine quantitatively and qualitatively the composition of forces and their supply with the necessary combat equipment. A special emphasis should be laid on the improvement of living, working and entertainment conditions of the military. The human factor should become the main force generator of national defense and it should be placed in the center of the military system efforts. The new Romanian system of planning, programming and budgeting is compatible with similar systems of NATO member states. The integrated approach of resources management will be in accordance with the missions of the armed forces and it will take into account the structural changes, as well as their influence on the military capabilities. The personnel strength of the Romanian Armed Forces will include 112,000 military personnel and 28,000 civilians. The implementation of the requirements for the restructuring of armed forces and their supply with equipment, imposes a real increase of funds from about 710 mil $, starting with the year 2000, to 1,190 mil $ in 2007 to which the foreign debts for procurement expenses and the money necessary for education and health, should be added. This is the best option for Romania and, at the same time, a realistic element of stability for the planning process. Under these circumstances, the strategy of resources allocation will aim at two fundamental simultaneous aspects. First, the funds will be allocated to the programs, which provide the achievement of Project Force - 2005 and are cost effective, by eliminating rapidly the means and programs, which are no longer necessary. Second, priority will be given to the balancing of our budget for the allocation of resources. In the year 2000, our budget will allocate 57% for personnel, 33% for operation and maintenance, 28% for the procurement of combat equipment, and 13% for administration. We estimate that in the year 2006 we shall meet the Alliance standards (40% for personnel, 35 - 40% for procurement, 25 - 20% for operation and maintenance). The resources allocation will be closely related to the budget envisaged for the multi-annual planning process. This process includes two phases. The first phase (2000 - 2003) will focus on orientating resources towards the restructuring of operational forces at the minimum requirements for a credible and interoperable defense. The second phase (2004 - 2007) will focus especially on the modernization of combat equipment. The phases of this process are interrelated, and their deadlines may be changed according to the allocation of additional funds.

## Conclusion

The Romanian Armed Forces operate based on the decisions made by the National Command Authorities, for the defense and promotion of national security interests of our country, which are stipulated in the state official documents. The human and material resources of Romania and the importance of its geographic position mean that our national interests can best be met by contributing to regional security. Militarily, an agile force, able to carry out adequate actions, is best fitted to this end. Such a force may make its contribution to the security operations under the aegis of UN, OSCE or other international organizations, due to the fact that its units are deployable, mobile and capable to be integrated rapidly in multinational structures. This force contributes to regional security, while representing the basis of partnership activities with our neighbors and with other states in the region and also being a real model for the training of professional military. It can act rapidly and efficiently both in conflict prevention and crisis management before the crisis turns into conflict, and to repel an aggression (if it occurs) and gain victory. Though the establishment and development of **Project Force - 2005** is expensive, the present day security environment allows us, nevertheless, to attain this objective, while maintaining an adequate level of response capability. The establishment of the new force structure, the modernization, professionalization, standardization of training and temporary rationalization of certain procurements are the best options under the constraints imposed by transition. Logistics should adapt its capabilities to the aims and objectives included in this strategy, by an adequate support to force sustainment. Our infrastructure should have the capability of supporting both our own military system, and that of our partners and future allies. The resources of the armed defense, including personnel, financial, technological, scientific, material and other means, allocated by the state, determine quantitatively and qualitatively the composition of forces and their supply with combat equipment necessary for the defense of our country. The Romanian Armed Forces will further be able to deter and, if necessary, to defeat a possible armed aggression against our country. They are ready to defend our nation's interests when ordered by the political leadership and according to the Constitution. Our armed forces are not meant to become a source of concern to other states. The Romanian Armed Forces represent and will continue to represent one of the fundamental institutions of our state and national security.
