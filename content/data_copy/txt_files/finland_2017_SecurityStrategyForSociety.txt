Summary

The Security Strategy for Society 2017 is a government resolution that harmonises
the set of national principles regarding preparedness and guides the preparedness
actions taken by the administrative branches.

In the first section of the Strategy, a cooperation model for comprehensive security
is presented. The model provides the basis for preparedness and taking necessary
actions in the event of different disruptions. The second section of the Strategy
provides the preparedness guidelines for the administrative branches.

The Security Strategy for Society was drawn up through broad-based cooperation,
taking into account the viewpoints of all actors. Since comprehensive security
is built in cooperation it involves the authorities, the business life, NGOs and
communities, and citizens.

Each administrative branch is responsible for implementing the Strategy within
its competence. The Security Committee monitors the Strategy’s implementation
and coordinates cooperation measures together with the ministries’ Heads of
Preparedness.

#### 1. Introduction

_The Security Strategy for Society lays out the general principles governing_
_preparedness in Finnish society. The preparedness is based on the principle_
_of comprehensive security in which the vital functions of society are jointly_
_safeguarded by the authorities, business operators, organisations and_
_citizens._


The Security Strategy for Society lays out the general principles governing preparedness in Finnish
society. The preparedness is based on the principle of comprehensive security in which the vital
functions of society are jointly safeguarded by the
authorities, business operators, organisations and
citizens.

The general preparedness principles are now updated for the fourth time as part of the Security
Strategy for Society (YTS 2017). The first cross-administrative strategy (Strategy for Securing the
Functions Vital to Society) was presented in 2003.
The strategy was in the form of a Government resolution and it described the preparedness threat
scenarios, strategic tasks of the ministries and the
principles for leadership in a crisis. The next update
of the strategy took place in 2006 and on this occasion, attention was on the management of incidents, and an extensive matrix to support emergency preparedness planning was presented. In
2010, the strategy was renamed as the Security
Strategy for Society. The change was in keeping
with general trends in society in which security
work had expanded to cover new areas, services
and functions. In accordance with these developments, organisations were now included as actors
in the preparedness system.


As in its predecessors, the general principles of
joint preparedness are at the core of the strategy.
As the operating environment is constantly changing, it has been necessary to update some of the
fundamental principles laid out in the document.
At the same time, some of the principles have remained largely unchanged despite rapid changes in
the security environment and technology. During
an extensive drafting process, it was determined
that a practical description of comprehensive security, the Finnish model of joint preparedness,
should be the main purpose of the new strategy.
Finland has a unique operating model that has also
attracted international interest. However, at national level, too, there should be greater awareness of comprehensive security because familiarity
with the preparedness principles will not only ensure better preparedness but it will also strengthen
the sense of security among the public.

Compared with the earlier definitions, comprehensive security has evolved into a cooperation model
in which actors share and analyse security information, prepare joint plans, as well as train and work
together. The cooperation model covers all relevant
actors, from citizens to the authorities. The cooperation is based on statutory tasks, cooperation agreements and the Security Strategy for Society.


-----

In previous strategies, the focus was on action at
Government level. In this strategy, the attention
is on the usability of the preparedness principles
at all operational levels of society and for this reason, the headings and contents of the seven vital
functions of society have been updated. The vital
functions describe the broad scope and cross-sectoral nature of the areas of preparedness. The role
of psychological resilience, one of the vital functions, has been underlined as a fundamental factor
underpinning the security of society. The strategy
describes how the general principles of preparedness and management should be applied at Government, regional and municipal level.

The strategic tasks allocated to the administrative
branches of individual ministries are described in
Part 2. The strategic tasks also form the basis for
the contingency and preparedness planning at regional and municipal level as well as in organisations.


Rapid changes and unpredictability are characteristic for Finland’s new foreign and security policy environment. The changes taking place in the operating environment also have a multitude of impacts
on internal developments in Finland. As a result,
new uncertainties affecting internal security have
arisen. According to international comparisons,
Finland is one of the most highly developed countries in the world in the digitalisation of public administration, public services and the markets. The
threats facing society are dynamic, of transboundary nature and constantly changing. Identifying the
threats and assessing their impacts have proven to
be difficult. In order to ensure that the contingency and preparedness planning is up to date, the national risk assessment will be revised in 2018 and it
will be extended to serve the risk analysis of the Security Strategy for Society to the extent necessary.
The dynamic nature of the threats requires new
operating approaches and broad-based cooperation between security actors, which are both described in this strategy.

#### 2. Concept for comprehensive security

_Comprehensive security is the Finnish cooperation-based preparedness model,_
_in which the vital functions of society are jointly managed by the authorities,_
_business operators, organisations and citizens._


**2.1. Steering of comprehensive**
**security**

The division of preparedness responsibilities and
tasks in society are based on legislation. The general principles of comprehensive security are set
out in this Government resolution. The Security
Committee monitors developments in order to ensure that the strategy is up to date and the document is revised by Government decision as necessary. The aim is that the general principles laid out
in the strategy would remain valid across government terms.

The practical implementation of comprehensive
security takes place on the basis of cross-administrative strategies, strategies for individual administrative branches, implementation programmes and
other documents. These include the Internal Security Strategy, the Finnish Cyber Security Strategy
and their implementation programmes.

The Government reports discussing security issues are intended as steering documents, and implementing the priorities and objectives laid out
in them strengthens Finland’s security and the
well-being of its citizens in an international environment where changes are rapid and difficult to
anticipate. Descriptions of the operating environ

ments play a central role from the perspective of
allocating resources to preparedness and security.

**2.2. Security actors**

The fact that the comprehensive security model
applied in Finland covers all levels and actors of society is its strength. Together with central government, the authorities, business operators, regions
and municipalities, such actors as universities, research institutions, organisations, other bodies and
individuals form a network of comprehensive security in which the sharing of information, setting of
joint objectives and commitments to cooperation
can take place in a flexible manner. In this model,
all actors taking part in coordinated security work
or security activities closely supporting it are security actors. Individual citizens also play an important role in independent preparedness and in enhancing the resilience of Finnish society.

Public administration, the authorities, universities
and research institutions play a central role in the
drafting of preparedness legislation, steering and
development as well as in the implementation of
the preparedness measures. Business operators
are playing an increasingly important role in the
preparedness process. In particular, companies will
continue to play a key role in the process of ensuring the functioning of the economy and the infra

-----

structure. At the same time, companies are assuming an increasingly prominent role in such areas as
social welfare and health care services. As business
operators are becoming more central players in society, it is becoming increasingly important to ensure that companies are able to continue their operations in times of crisis.

Organisations play a central role in the preparedness for accidents and disruptions. Organisations
provide services, coordinate the participation of
volunteers in the activities supporting authorities,
and maintain special expertise in such areas as contingency operations. Organisations also channel, direct and coordinate the help offered by non-members in a broad range of different tasks. Religious
communities play an important role in comprehensive security tasks.

In addition to organisations, active citizens also
make a significant contribution to the resilience of
society. Individuals are becoming increasingly important security actors through their own choices
and work, and as members of their families and
local communities. The knowledge and skills possessed by individuals as well as their security-oriented attitude form the basis for a resilient society.
The willingness to take part and help also manifests
itself as social media networks and independent
peer groups. These are part of a civil society and
in their most effective form, they contribute to the
strengthening of society’s resilience.


Coordination of voluntary activities means the encouragement of cooperation between the authorities, administrative branches and organisations. In
practice, it means joint agreements, training and
exercises, contingency and preparedness planning,
and the consideration of organisations’ role in the
preparedness process. Administrative branches,
the authorities and key organisations agree on the
cooperation arrangements required for performing
strategic tasks in such areas as prevention of risks,
training, preparedness, communications, operations during accidents and disruptions, as well as
in the recovery process. The flexible nature of the
organisational activities and the fact that they can
also be extended to cover the tasks falling outside
the responsibility of the authorities are used in the
preparedness process.

In preparedness at municipal level, consideration
is given to outsourced services and cooperation
with business operators and organisations. Organisations, contractual bodies and the voluntary sector play an important role as providers of security functions and services, supporting society-wide
preparedness in a broad-based manner. Administrative branches and the authorities consider the
resources and preparedness of the organisations at
national, regional and local level. The role and tasks
of the organisations are agreed on in advance. At
the same time, the organisations are expected to
know their role and tasks within the framework of
comprehensive security and to have made the necessary arrangements to ensure the continuity of
their operations.


-----

**2.3. Preparedness**

Preparedness means activities ensuring that all
tasks can continue with minimum interruptions
and that the required exceptional measures can
be performed during disruptions occurring in normal conditions and during emergencies. Preparedness measures include contingency planning, continuity management, advance preparations, training
and preparedness exercises. Preparedness is based
on the preparedness obligation laid down in the
Emergency Powers Act (1552/2011), the Rescue Act
(379/2011) and other special legislation. The aim
of preparedness is to prevent accidents and disruptions, to prepare for the measures required during a
threat of an accident or disruption or during an accident or disruption and plan the recovery process.
Preparedness planning and cooperation are the task
of the responsible and competent authorities.

The aim of preparedness at national level is to
safeguard society’s vital functions in accordance
with the principle of the rule of law. By preparing
for disruptions occurring in normal conditions and
emergencies, actors in Finnish society can ensure
their operational capability and that they are able
to perform their tasks (both ordinary and exceptional) in all situations.


In addition to the preparedness obligation of public administration, independent preparedness of
business operators, other bodies and households
is an important part of Finland’s resilience. Independent preparedness means preparedness of individuals, housing communities and households
for situations where daily life is disrupted. Promoting citizens’ preparedness requires systematic dissemination of information and appropriate training offerings. Organisations play a key role in the
development of and support for independent preparedness. Such independent preparedness covers incidents affecting daily life, serious disruptions
and crises. Organisations also support the authorities by recruiting personnel and by training committed volunteers under the guidance of the responsible authorities.

Public administration actors and other bodies draft
their preparedness plans within the framework of
comprehensive security. In a digitalised and networked society, it is essential to identify all relevant
security actors and understand the interconnected
nature of activities taking place in society. Preparedness and security obligations must be extended to
cover the entire service production chain and information through agreements and regulation. Functions and actors vital to society are defined in this

strategy. There should be cooperation forums of security actors (such as preparedness forums) at national
level and in each region, municipality and community
so that successful coordination and implementation
of the general preparedness process can be ensured.
The cooperation forums would specify the functions
for their own areas of responsibility, functions relevant to their own activities and joint activities that are
vital to the functioning of society.

When the cooperation forums are organised, appropriate consideration should be given to the cooperation models and good practices already used
at regional and local level so that overlaps can be
avoided and uniform quality ensured. The cooperation structures should be built so that opportunities for extensive and open participation are offered in all areas.

In accordance with the general preparedness process, the cooperation forums would assess the
risks pertaining to the joint activities, as well as the
likelihood and impacts of the risks. Special consideration should be given to the risks in the interfaces between actors and sectors as well as the
opportunities for cooperation. The cooperation forums should also assess available resources as well
as plan and implement communications regarding preparedness. All this would form the basis for
the preparedness plan that would also include the
lines of authority, continuity management, use of
resources, crisis communications plan, and the recovery from the crisis in different scenarios. The
workability of the preparedness plans and the competence of the security actors would be ensured by
training and joint exercises.

In the preparedness work, the focus would be on
proaction instead of reaction. Preparedness planning can only be successfully carried out if tacit signals can be detected and foresight methods, research findings, innovative experimental culture
as well as data and geographic information analyses are used. Monitoring of change trends in the


operating environment and the review of scenarios as part of exercises make the parties better prepared for unexpected situations. The second important part in the development of preparedness is
the use of feedback, audits, accident investigations
and other expert assessments. It must be possible
to assess the quality and effectiveness of the preparedness in a reliable manner. This means that the
assessment process must also be part of the preparedness planning.

Preparedness and security competence forms the basis for the understanding of comprehensive security
phenomena, development of operations and the use
of technologies, and requires that the competence
needs are defined. High-quality research at national
level is essential for developing competence. Moreover, it must be ensured that adequate technological
and industrial expertise and production capacity are
already available during normal conditions.

Preparedness work and security information must
be as widely available as possible so that all parties (the authorities, business operators, organisations, other bodies and citizens) can be involved in
the process and be committed to joint preparedness in accordance with the principle of comprehensive security. When information is shared, it
must be remembered, however, that for reasons of
security, not all information can be widely disseminated. The aim of the cooperation is to create sufficient trust between the actors, which also allows
any conflicts of interest to be resolved without endangering joint objectives.

Compliance with national and EU legislation as well as
the international obligations binding on Finland must
be ensured. This is essential for ensuring national preparedness and Finland’s operating prerequisites as
well as for ensuring cooperation in the EU and in other international forums. At the same time, it must also
be remembered that the authorities are ultimately
responsible for preparedness arrangements and coordination of preparedness at national level.


-----

**2.4. Leadership and coordination of**
**preparedness**

All actors must ensure adequate level of preparedness as part of their daily operations. During disruptions occurring in normal conditions and in
emergencies, only minimum changes are made to
the lines of authority, organisation and the division of responsibilities. During disruptions, the operations are led by responsible and competent authorities or other security actors that are obliged to
do so by law. They perform the work in accordance
with their own duties and competence.

The Government directs, supervises and coordinates the safeguarding of functions vital to society.
Each competent ministry does the same in its own
administrative branch. The task of the permanent
secretary is to ensure the overall security and preparedness of their ministry and its administrative
branch. In order to facilitate preparedness and to
instigate activities, each competent authority employs its statutory powers, which are already quite
exhaustive in normal conditions. The Security Com

mittee assists the Government in comprehensive
security preparedness and in its coordination. The
Security Committee monitors the implementation
of the Security Strategy for Society, developments
in the security environment and the level of preparedness in individual administrative branches.

Regional administration, municipalities and business communities and organisations manage preparedness planning in cooperation with other authorities, business operators and organisations.
Each responsible party coordinates its work with
commercial service providers and organisations
supporting the activities. In this process, consideration must be given to cooperation agreements,
competence development, training, exercises, contingency and preparedness planning as well as the
role of business operators and organisations.

Regional State Administrative Agencies (AVI Centres) are responsible for coordinating the preparedness of the actors in their regions, arranging
training and preparedness exercises, and supporting preparedness planning in municipalities. The

Regional preparedness after the
introduction of the social welfare, health
care and regional government reform

Under the social welfare, health care and regional government reform, the Ministry of the Interior
will assume responsibility for the coordination of
regional joint preparedness at national level. The
ministry will be responsible for organising the cooperation framework for drafting preparedness arrangements, which also involves other ministries
and actors as well as the Security Committee. This
will ensure that the regional preparedness arrangements will provide an effective framework for preparedness at national level. The national permit
and supervisory authority will also have a role in
the supervision of preparedness. The authorities,
business operators and organisations maintain and
develop cooperation and situation awareness at regional and local level so that the vital functions of
society can be safeguarded.

The regions to be established as part of the reform
will be responsible for the coordination of the preparedness of the authorities, municipalities, business operators and organisations in their areas and
they will also cooperate with each other and central government actors. Regions will be responsible
for maintaining the cooperation forums required
in the coordination work in collaboration with regional actors, for organising cross-administrative
assessment of regionally important risks and for
the cross-administrative monitoring and evaluation
of the changes in the operating environment that
have security impacts. Regions will also be responsible for organising contingency and preparedness
exercises in cooperation with regional actors. Regional joint preparedness tasks will be carried out
in extensive cooperation with regional actors. Regional actors will be able to make extensive use of
the network-based cooperation as they make preparedness arrangements and as cooperation structures are developed.


regional preparedness committees coming under
the agencies are responsible for coordinating the
preparedness work. Centres for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment (ELY Centres)
are responsible for preparedness, and leadership in
a crisis pertaining to their own tasks.

The manner in which the municipalities are expected to act in crisis situations is based on statutory
contingency planning. Each of the sectors responsible for municipal services prepares their own plans
for crisis situations. The chief executive and the local executive are jointly responsible for preparedness work in municipalities.

Most of the daily disruptions are dealt with by the
authorities and service providers. If a disruption
develops into an incident, cooperation bodies must
produce an assessment of the situation so that the
responsible parties can be provided with adequate
support. If necessary, national and international capabilities are used in the process.

Management models drafted in advance and tested in exercises are essential for ensuring effective
action in incidents. Only minimum changes should
be made to the lines of authority applied to preparedness and incidents, to the preparedness organisation and the division of responsibilities, irrespective of the situation. Cooperation between the
authorities, business operators, organisations and
other bodies as well as citizens is coordinated in advance within the framework of the preparedness
cooperation structures. This ensures smooth cooperation during incidents and emergencies.


-----

Regions will be responsible for the preparedness
tasks that they are required to perform under
the law. Sectors in the region administration and
region-owned companies will draw up the necessary risk analyses and threat assessments as
well as the preparedness plans for them. They
will also introduce other continuity management
measures, as required by law. Regions must ensure that uniform consideration is given to the
preparedness obligations of outsourced services
and contractual service production and that the
actual preparedness of the service providers is
incorporated into the regional preparedness exercises. The aim is to ensure highly coordinated
preparedness planning and other preparedness
arrangements in a multisectoral region group
so that it, too, would be steered as a single entity. Regions will be responsible for the practical organisation of the preparedness and security tasks, for providing the resources required for
the services, and for more extensive cooperation
with other regions.


Cooperation between municipalities and regions
will be essential for the preparedness arrangements and the management of incidents. From
the perspective of individuals, organisations and
other bodies, municipalities are key players in the
preparedness for incidents and emergencies. Municipalities are responsible for providing a broad
range of different services, such as education. This
means that municipalities make a particularly important contribution to resilience in society in the
field of expertise, skills and education, by promoting well-being and health as well as by organising
youth work. Municipalities help to strengthen the
resilience of social structures through local business and industrial policy as well as through land
use and building planning. In many parts of Finland,
district heating and water supply, which are both of
vital importance, are managed by municipalities or
municipal companies. The chief executive, working
under the local executive and cooperating with the
municipal management team, is in charge of preparedness in municipalities. However, at practical
level, the responsibility for preparedness and relevant action is shared by a large number of different actors and for this reason, smooth cooperation
in the field of preparedness is also essential in municipalities.

#### 3. Vital functions 

_Vital functions are essential for the functioning of society and they must be_
_maintained in all situations._


Vital functions of society cover the statutory tasks
of a large number of actors in a cross-sectoral manner and they also include areas where the responsibility is shared by several parties.


These vital functions are fundamental to preparedness planning at all operational levels. The practical tasks and responsibilities based on a risk assessment are planned so that they can be safeguarded.
At Government level, administrative branches have
been assigned strategic tasks for safeguarding vital functions and these tasks and the ministries responsible for them are described in Part 2.

**3.1. Leadership**

_Ensuring leadership is vital as it_
_provides the basis for safeguarding_
_all other functions. Functioning_
_leadership must be ensured in all_
_situations and at all operational_
_levels. Effective dealing with incidents_
_requires close cooperation between the_
_parties responsible for leadership, for_
_providing the situation picture and for_
_communications._

Leadership is an integral part of contingency and
preparedness arrangements. Threats against vital
functions can only be successfully dealt with if all
security actors involved jointly support well-functioning leadership. Sharing the information provided by warning and foresight systems at an early stage helps to prevent incidents and to mitigate
their harmful impacts.

Effective leadership requires:

-  clear lines of authority, explicit assignment
of responsibilities and competent authorities
with decision-making capability,

-  a situation picture (situation awareness,
assessment of future developments),

-  crisis communications,

-  sharing of information and technical solutions
supporting this,

-  continuity management and

-  cooperation.

In accordance with the concept for comprehensive security, successful management of the incidents threatening vital functions of society is based
on extensive cooperation between the authorities,
local government, administrative branches, ministries and business operators as well as on supporting other security actors. The competent authority
is in charge of the operations, initiates the measures to manage the incident, is responsible for
communications, and provides information on the
situation in accordance with agreed practices. Oth

er authorities as well as central and local government agencies take part in the work and provide
mutual administrative support to the extent required. It is essential to have clear lines of authority. The lines of authority may change during the incident, and in such situations it is essential that the
actors keep each other, the state leadership and
other high level officials at regional and local level
up to date with the developments. The operations
are supported by local, regional and national cooperation forums, which meet as necessary to support the management of the incident, to form a situation picture and to assess the course of events.

Contingency planning, training and exercises at
national, regional and local level, cross-administrative cooperation, and correctly timed reaction
to situations provide the basis for successful management of incidents. Sharing the information
provided by warning and foresight systems at an
early stage helps to prevent incidents and to mitigate their harmful impacts. Management of incidents must be in accordance with the legislation
in effect at the time. The organisational structures
and operating models established for normal conditions should be used in the work.

The ability to react flexibly and at the right time is
essential for the management of multifaceted and
rapidly evolving incidents. Coordination of the
work and communications must be safeguarded
through cooperation between the authorities and
other security actors. At Government level, the
competent ministry or the Prime Minister’s Office
convenes an extraordinary meeting of the heads
of preparedness, as necessary.

If necessary, the Government Situation Centre is
provided with additional resources so that a coordinated situation picture can be produced. A
meeting of heads of preparedness and other designated officials may also be convened to coordinate and prepare cooperation for the meeting of
permanent secretaries.


-----

At state leadership level, the competent ministry
is in charge of the activities and, if necessary, coordinates the cooperation between ministries. The
Prime Minister is in charge of the government activities, represents Finland in the European Council, and is responsible for the coordination of the
preparation and consideration of matters within the Government’s purview. The Prime Minister
also chairs the meetings of the government plenary sessions and cabinet committees and is in charge
of cabinet negotiations. The role of the Prime Minister as the official in charge of the Government is
highlighted during incidents and in preparedness
work, in which coordination and action based on
correctly timed information are essential. Many of
the crises also have foreign policy implications and
in such situations, Finland’s foreign policy is jointly
managed by the President of the Republic and the
Government.

**Local and regional level**


Communications are part of an organisation’s strategic activities and its management. The principles
applied to communications in normal conditions
also apply to external and internal communications during incidents and emergencies. Monitoring and analysis of the public opinion and citizens’
attitudes also assume an important role during incidents and emergencies and their purpose is to
support the authorities and other security actors in
leadership and communications.

Modelled on how the state leadership acts in such
situations, the general principles applied to the
management of incidents are also observed at regional and local level. In regions and municipalities,
the priority is on what is required at local level. The
lines of authority and the principles governing the
compilation and sharing of the situation picture
will be of central importance in the management of
municipalities and the regions to be established as
part of the social welfare, health care and regional
government reform.

**3.2. International and EU activities**

_International activities cover all levels_
_and sectors in the Finnish society._
_Providing a basis for international_
_cooperation and participation in crisis_
_prevention are an integral part of the_
_safeguarding of other vital functions_
_of society. Security cooperation at EU_
_level is an integral part of security_
_planning in administrative branches._

Finland is part of a networked world where security
effects cross national boundaries. Central government, public administration, business operators,
organisations and citizens take part in international activities within their own frames of reference.
Ministries and public administration actors take
part in decision-making in the EU, maintain and
develop contacts with foreign countries and other
international actors, and ensure Finland’s operating prerequisites in international cooperation arrangements. The functioning of Finland’s national
EU coordination system is safeguarded by enabling
effective and correctly timed participation in EU
decision-making. Each ministry is responsible for
EU and international matters in its area of responsibility. The Government EU Affairs Department in
the Prime Minister’s Office coordinates the drafting and processing of the matters decided in the
European Union. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs
assists other ministries in the coordination of international matters. Finland’s capacity to receive foreign assistance and support and to provide other
countries with assistance and support will also be
improved.


Finnish citizens and foreigners permanently residing in Finland are assisted during incidents occurring in foreign countries. The prerequisites for
foreign trade are safeguarded in all circumstances. Finland will actively participate in civilian and
military crisis management. Finland will also take
part in international rescue and humanitarian assistance activities where cooperation between
public administration and non-governmental organisations is essential. Humanitarian assistance
is channelled to people in the most vulnerable position and Finland will also promote adherence to
humanitarian values and compliance with international agreements and other international obligations. Global threats, such as uncontrolled migration, pandemics, terrorism and international crime
can be prevented in many ways. The main instruments in this work are the promotion of sustainable development, human rights and democracy,
slowing down of climate change and preparing for
its impacts, diplomacy, peace mediation, international crisis management, arms control, strengthening health and food security as well as support
for and development of the rules-based international order.

In their own preparedness, regions and municipalities will consider international activities in such areas as cross-border cooperation with neighbouring
regions and support for international cooperation
between the authorities. There will be extensive
cooperation with international organisations and
this also helps to consolidate and strengthen national preparedness.


-----

**3.3. Defence capability**

_Finland will safeguard its independence_
_and territorial integrity by maintaining_
_a defence capability tailored to its_
_security environment. The primary_
_objective of the development and_
_maintenance of Finland’s defence_
_capability is to establish deterrence_
_against the use of military force_
_against Finland and the threat of using_
_military force. If necessary, Finland will_
_repeal the military threats against it by_
_means of military force._

Finland’s defence capability comprises the military
capabilities of its defence system, preparedness
level of Finnish society, cooperation between national authorities and international defence cooperation. The ability to receive and provide military
assistance is part of Finland’s defence capability.

Changes in our security environment put the focus
on society’s resilience in which the citizens’ will to
defend their country is of key importance. Finland’s
defence capability is based on the strong will of its
citizens to defend their country.

In addition to traditional military threats, Finland
is preparing to meet more multifaceted threats,
which combine military and non-military means.
The preparedness to respond to military and
non-military threats will be developed as part of
the concept for comprehensive security in a joint
effort by the authorities, business operators, organisations and citizens. Finland’s defence adminis

tration is responsible for preventing and repealing
military threats and it supports society and the authorities in accordance with the concept for comprehensive security. Military national defence is
systematically supported with the resources available in society without endangering the continuity
of other vital functions.

Finland’s defence capability will be maintained and
developed on a long-term basis. Maintaining and
developing the defence capability also requires
close cooperation between different actors in Finnish society. Rapid deployment of the capabilities
and resources of the authorities and partners will
be safeguarded through partnership and security
agreements, letters of intent, and joint exercises.
Organisations will be provided with a more extensive role in the maintenance of the defence capability.

In normal conditions, the use of the defence capability helps to ensure the monitoring and safeguarding of Finland’s territorial integrity. The Finnish Defence Forces provide mutual administrative
support for maintaining public order and security and for safeguarding other functions of society,
and take part in rescue operations. The Finnish Defence Forces also assist in the efforts to prevent
and disrupt terrorist offences.

The use of the defence capability helps to repeal violations of territorial integrity and military attacks
during emergencies. Finland is prepared to meet all
military threats, ranging from military pressure to
large-scale attacks. The ability to respond quickly
to an attack is crucial.


-----

**3.4. Internal security**

_By maintaining internal security Finland_
_can prevent and counter criminal_
_activities against it and its population,_
_and prevent accidents, environmental_
_damage and other similar incidents_
_and threats. It also allows Finland to_
_successfully manage the consequences_
_of the above activities, threats and_
_incidents. The work is supported by_
_close cooperation between other_
_national and international authorities,_
_European Union and actors at all_
_administrative levels._

The legal protection of the population and the
rights guaranteed in the Constitution of Finland will
be safeguarded in all situations by ensuring independent judiciary and adherence to the principle
of the rule of law. This will strengthen the sense
of security and trust in the authorities. The prerequisites for holding general elections will be safeguarded in all security situations.

Maintaining public order and security helps to protect Finland’s key infrastructure. It also helps to
prevent and counter terrorism, organised crime
and other serious crime, and serious incidents. An
effective pre-trial investigation system and crime
prevention helps to counter crime and maintain social stability. Independent investigation of serious
accidents and other incidents is an effective instrument in preventing recurrence of similar events.

Maintenance of border security helps to prevent violations of the provisions on the crossing of the national border and external border and the threats to
public order and security arising from cross-border
passenger traffic. This also helps to prevent transboundary crime and to guarantee the safety and


smooth flow of cross-border traffic. Surveillance
and safeguarding of Finland’s territorial integrity and
maintenance of the national defence capability are
also part of the maintenance of border security.

Safety of supply chains and goods is ensured with
proactive identification of critical actors and their
supply chains, risk management of commercial
traffic, and preparedness of the actors involved.
Surveillance of supply chains and the safety of
goods help to detect illegal actors and prevent illegal transport of goods by different modes of transport at external and internal borders of the EU.

In the maritime search and rescue area of responsibility, the most appropriate assistance is allocated
for locating and rescuing people in danger without
delay. Cooperation between the authorities, preparedness planning and the involvement of organisations and other bodies will guarantee high performance maritime search and rescue operations
in individual rescue assignments, major accidents
and compound accidents.

Rescue services are responsible for the measures
required in accidents involving human lives, property and the environment and for preventing such
accidents. The emergency medical services provided as part of social welfare and health care will ensure urgent aid for everybody in all parts of Finland
in all circumstances. The responsibility extends
from everyday accidents to major disasters and to
emergency preparedness. Organisations, contractual bodies and the voluntary sector play an important role in rescue operations, in tasks supporting the authorities and in supporting independent
preparedness. Rescue services are prepared to provide and receive assistance in major accidents and
crises in cooperation with other national authorities, the EU civil protection mechanism and other
international rescue service systems.


-----

**3.5. Economy, infrastructure and**
**security of supply**

_Ensuring the functioning of the_
_economy, infrastructure and security of_
_supply helps to safeguard the funding_
_and other resources for vital functions._
_The domestic and international_
_infrastructure, organisations,_
_structures and processes essential for_
_vital functions are safeguarded._

Stability of the financial system and the continuity of the financial market services essential for
the functioning of society are safeguarded in all
circumstances through effective control and regulation and by maintaining crisis management
preparedness. A national operating model and national backup systems exist so that the continuity
of the financial market services essential for the
functioning and security of society can be guaranteed during incidents and emergencies.

Sustainability of general government finances and
the economic and human resources required for
the functioning of public administration are guaranteed. The fundraising capacity of central government and its ability to meet its payment obligations
are guaranteed in normal conditions, incidents and
emergencies. Continuity of operational, financial
planning and budget processes is ensured. Economic resources are reallocated, as necessary, and
the availability and adequacy of the public administration human resources and the facilities equipped
with the necessary infrastructure are guaranteed in
all situations.

Central government actors promote the implementation and supervision of data security and data
protection legislation and, by providing advice and
guidelines, strengthen the awareness of data security threats in companies, other bodies and citizens
and encourage them to prepare for the impacts
of the threats. Information and communications


The purpose of civil defence is to protect the population in accidents and other dangerous situations occurring in normal conditions without loss
of human life. During armed conflicts, preparations
will be made to protect the population in civil defence shelters, in premises yielding maximum protection or through evacuations. The measures will
be based on risk assessments and will depend on
the types of threat. Preparing for military threats
will also be the main purpose for constructing civil
defence shelters in the future. Ministries and other authorities will prepare for civil defence tasks in
their areas of responsibility.

The emergency response centres support rescue
services, the police, social welfare and health care
sector, the Finnish Border Guard and the other assisting actors (including organisations) in urgent
emergency tasks.

By keeping immigration under control, Finland can
ensure regulated immigration, make the appropriate decisions and maintain the capacity to prevent
illegal immigration. Proper management of a major influx of immigrants also means that Finland has
the capability to receive the immigrants and provide them with the necessary basic security.

The authorities and business operators will make
joint preparations for biological, chemical and radiological threats in accordance with international health regulations. This preparedness is supported by organisations and citizens. National steering,
structures and processes pertaining to the identification of biological threat, preparations for and
reactions to them will be established on the basis
of an external assessment. Countering of environmental damage includes the nationwide organisation and development of oil and chemical spill response. Environmental administration authorities
in the national permit and supervisory authority
and in research institutions will provide mutual administrative support in natural and environmental
accidents.


-----

systems, digital services and data essential for vital functions are secured in the facilities available
to public administration actors and other bodies.
A smoothly functioning model for managing information and cyber incidents incorporates the obligations laid down in the European Union network
and information security provisions. For a more
detailed description, see Finland’s Cyber Security
Strategy and its regularly updated implementation
programme.

The transport operations necessary for vital functions of society and livelihood of the population are
safeguarded in all situations. Transport infrastructure and the key logistic chains as well as the maintenance, repairs and reserve parts supply of the
critical transport equipment as well as the power
supply are ensured.

Sufficient and safe nourishment for the population is safeguarded by means of food supply. The
supply of production inputs and skilled workforce
required in the primary production, processing of
foodstuffs, logistics, households, mass catering and
water services is ensured. Ensuring the supply of
daily consumer goods is also essential for the functional capacity of the population. At the same time,
measures are also taken to improve independent
preparedness for serious disruptions in the supply
of daily consumer goods among the population.

The operational network of water supply is comprehensively safeguarded and this also includes
the discharge points of treated wastewater taken
from springs. Water supply of large population centres, society’s vital functions and food production
is ensured. An environmental monitoring system is
maintained and effective waste management ensured. Supply of housing and adequate construction capacity is ensured during emergencies. Flood
risks are also managed and dam safety supervised.


Functioning of the infrastructure is guaranteed by
ensuring the availability of sufficient labour workforce and by maintaining security of supply. The
measures required for maintaining security of supply are dimensioned so that the livelihood of the
population, vital functions of society, food supply,
social welfare and health care services, availability of pharmaceuticals and vaccines as well as the
material basis for national defence are not endangered. Proper functioning of the European single
market is essential for Finland’s security of supply.

Domestic solutions and international cooperation
will ensure continuous supply of energy. Finland
will ensure that it has a domestic electricity generation capacity providing it with a broad-based, reasonably priced and adequate power supply. Supply
of energy for the facilities used by public administration actors and other bodies is safeguarded.

Competence essential for business operators and
public organisations and their capacity to produce
innovations is also safeguarded in emergencies.
The national economy, infrastructure and security
of supply are built on technologies; this means that
critical technological capabilities are a key concern.


-----

**3.6. Functional capacity of the**
**population and services**

_Functional capacity of the population_
_and its well-being are safeguarded_
_by maintaining the key basic services._
_They help to ensure independent living_
_in all situations._

Adequate social security as well as social welfare and
health care services are essential for a smoothly functioning society, and these will be safeguarded during
incidents and emergencies affecting Finnish society.
The need for urgent services is highlighted in incidents because in a crisis there are nearly always people in need of medical and other assistance as well as
social welfare services. Municipalities and regions will
be responsible for ensuring that people receive the
urgent services essential for their functional capacity and well-being in all situations, irrespective of their
place of residence and the time of the day. The preparedness obligation of social welfare and health care
actors applies to all service providers. In incidents affecting Finnish society, the population will be guaranteed essential and urgent social welfare and health
care services. Emergency medical services offered as
part of social welfare and health care are provided in
all circumstances at regional and national level.

Continuation of the most important educational
and training services (from early childhood education to higher education) is ensured. Society also
has the capacity to provide children and young
people with security and services in accordance
with the child’s best interests, to offer adult educational services during incidents and emergencies and to deal with the threats and crises affecting education and training services. Guaranteeing
of the key educational and training services and research will guarantee the continuation of the educational and research system. It is essential to preserve citizens’ trust in effective social welfare and
health care services as well as the continuation of
educational and training services at different levels during crises and as part of crisis preparedness.


**3.7. Psychological resilience**

_Psychological resilience means the_
_ability of individuals, communities,_
_society and the nation to withstand_
_the pressures arising from crisis_
_situations and to recover from_
_their impacts. Good psychological_
_resilience facilitates the recovery_
_process. Psychological resilience_
_is expressed in the citizens’ will to_
_defend their country’s independence_
_as well as in the determination_
_to maintain the livelihood and_
_security of the population in all_
_situations. Creating and maintaining_
_psychological resilience is a long-_
_standing and cross-cutting effort_
_involving different administrative_
_branches._

The basis for psychological resilience is created in
normal conditions. The strength of the nation’s
psychological resilience strongly depends on how
society manages to safeguard vital functions and
perform the strategic tasks associated with them.
There may be deliberate efforts to weaken the operating capability of the democratic institutions,
position of the state leadership and the credibility
of decision-makers during a crisis.

Citizens’ trust in the authorities is essential for
maintaining psychological resilience. Trust in society and trust between citizens are central to ensuring resilience. Trust is built during normal conditions. The authorities must observe the same
fundamental principles and values in normal conditions, during incidents and in emergencies so
that they can retain the trust of the citizens. This
is essentially dependent on how effectively the
authorities, organisations and other bodies disseminate information during incidents and emergencies.


-----

Psychological resilience is maintained by ensuring
basic educational and cultural services and longterm official communications. Educational and cultural services help to improve citizens’ knowledge
and their ability to act and work in a changing society. They also create a basis for psychological resilience. Education and training, the activities provided by organisations as well as civic activities, such
as sports, cultural and youth work, also encourage
participation and strengthen community spirit. Educational, cultural and civic activities as well as the
activities of religious communities provide people
with opportunities for social and community participation and for civic engagement and a chance to
build networks. The media plays an important role
in the formation and sustaining of the nation’s psychological resilience. Encouraging critical media literacy and digital basic skills and promoting reliable
journalism and media atmosphere strengthen civic participation, help citizens to safely navigate in a
multifaceted media environment and help to combat disinformation.

Social divisions can be prevented when citizens are
happy with their lives, feel healthy and have a good
functional capacity. Prevention of social exclusion
as well as prevention of the widening of social gaps
help to ensure fairness in society, strengthen psy

chological resilience, and contribute to social stability. Organisations and such actors as religious
communities provide citizens with a social framework that helps to build trust, encourages people
to engage in civic activism and prevents social exclusion. This supports individuals’ ability to cope
with incidents and emergencies.

For sustaining the psychological resilience, it is important for people to control stress factors and
maintain the patterns of everyday life during incidents and crises. They help to maintain the sense
of security and trust in the future and provide citizens with resources to cope with all situations. Individuals can assume responsibility for strengthening their own security and the security of their local
communities. Organisations play an important role
in the promotion of the safety culture and in the
activation of citizens in the improvement of their
own security and the security of their local communities. Psychological resilience can be strengthened through training and reliable communications
which also civil society actors and organisations can
support and promote in their own networks in accordance with their roles. Organisations also produce information on citizens’ security needs and
relay this information to society’s decision-makers.

#### 4. Risk assessment as a basis  for preparedness

_Preparedness is always based on risk assessments. The risk assessments_
_must be comprehensive and include all threat scenarios. Threat scenarios_
_are specified on the basis of changes in threat assessments, which require_
_continuous and regular assessment and updating of risks._


The Security Strategy for Society 2017 uses the national risk assessment produced in 2015 and the
threat models described in the Security Strategy
for Society 2010 as a basis for its preparedness risk
analysis. The national risk assessment of 2015 was
based on the European Union legislation on the
civil protection mechanism. It was drawn up in a
cross-administrative project managed by the Ministry of the Interior and steered by the Security
Committee.

The risk assessment on comprehensive security
is updated about every three years. The risks assessment is based on the national risk assessment
process. The next update of the risk assessment
will take place in 2018. In that update, the document will also be expanded to cover the threat
models laid out in the Security Strategy for Society. The aim is that the national risk assessment
should form the basis for preparedness planning
at all levels of action.

Threats may be appear on their own, simultaneously or as continuums. Changes and threats
may be unexpected, rapid and their duration
may vary. All this must be taken into account in
the risk assessment. Some of the threats may
arise as deliberate action by a specific actor,
while others may be unintentional. The reasons,


origins, specific targets, objectives, scope and
repercussions of the threats are difficult to predict. Furthermore, it is not always possible to reliably assess the likelihood of the realisation of
the threats, at least not in the long term. Not all
potential instruments of influence can be identified in advance.

With changing threat dynamics, there will be more
emphasis on broad-based cooperation in the risk
analysis and priority will be given to situation-specific solutions. The focus will be on the readiness
to adapt to unexpected changes and to prepare
for different types of hybrid influencing and cyber
threats affecting society and to strengthen the capacity to deal with those threats.

All parties responsible for preparedness in society and management of incidents must actively
and continuously analyse and monitor changes
in the operating environment and maintain anticipatory capabilities. Situation awareness of all
parties involved in the preparedness can be improved through joint situation monitoring and
assessment. Networked and cross-administrative cooperation based on the concept for comprehensive security is important at national and
international level.


-----

The security environment and changes in it are
discussed in the security reports produced by
the Government and in the assessments produced by individual actors and administrative
branches. For example, change trends in internal security are described in the Internal Secu

rity Strategy. Preparedness cooperation bodies
must make effective use of the risk analyses and
analyses of the operating environment relevant
to their areas of responsibility. The participants
must supplement the analyses with their own assessments.


|SSfS 2010|NATIONAL RISK ASSESSMENT 2015|

#### 5. Implementation and monitoring of the strategy and developing preparedness

_The general preparedness principles laid out in the Security Strategy for_
_Society support all actors in society in their preparedness planning, in the_
_implementation of their plans and in their practical security work._


Continuous monitoring of preparedness taking
place in accordance with the concept for comprehensive security comprises preparedness planning,
implementation programmes and the tasks based
on them as well as their monitoring at each operational level.

At Government level, each ministry is responsible
for the monitoring and development of its own
preparedness. The purpose of the Security Committee is to support preparedness at Government
level and it produces a joint situation picture of
contingency and preparedness measures. The Security Committee reports on the security situation
in society to the state leadership each year. The
same operating principle can also be applied at regional and local level.

Preparedness will be developed by more extensive and in-depth application of the preparedness
process, which is based on the comprehensive security cooperation model presented in the strategy. Participation of all security actors in preparedness planning, building of the situation picture and
awareness, as well as training are key areas in the
process. In addition to the participation of business operators and organisations, ensuring the preparedness of ordinary citizens and the use of this
preparedness must be made an integral part of the
preparedness of the security actors.


To ensure a successful preparedness process, it is
essential that it is integrated into other areas of operational and resource planning, incorporates the
anticipatory perspective and makes active use of
research information. This means that, at its best,
preparedness can prevent undesirable events and
produce highly cost-effective benefits.


-----

**General principles of comprehensive security**

|Democracy and the rule of law|Comprehensive security is based on the inviolability of human dignity, principles of representative democracy, separation of powers, lawfulness of the use of public powers and other principles of the rule of law. The rights of the individuals must be safeguarded in all situations and the authorities must be provided with adequate powers.|
|---|---|
|Lines of authority are based on the model of competent authority|Lines of authority are based on statutory tasks and the responsibilities of competent authorities. Other security actors support the competent authorities.|
|All actors must be involved - comprehensive use of society’s resources|Vital functions are secured by efficient and comprehensive use of society’s resourc- es. This requires cooperation between the public sector, business operators, organ- isations and other bodies as well as citizens and coordination of activities in all situ- ations. Adequate resources for preparedness must be ensured. Cost-effectiveness is promoted by developing and coordinating procedures and systems used in nor- mal conditions so that they can also be applied during incidents.|
|Preparedness is supported by comprehensive security cooperation forums|Competent authorities can rely on the support of the broad-based cooperation fo- rums promoting contingency and preparedness planning. At practical level, these include the meetings of heads of preparedness and permanent secretaries (at Government level), Security Committee (in support of the Government), and the National Emergency Supply Agency (as the agency maintaining and developing Finland’s security of supply). Competent authorities are also supported by the pre- paredness committees of individual ministries and administrative branches, region- al preparedness committees, and management teams for municipal preparedness planning.|
|Foresight, flexibility and recovery|With comprehensive preparedness arrangements, risks can be more effectively an- ticipated and resources used in a flexible manner. The aim in the planning of the recovery process is to ensure better resilience and higher level of preparedness.|
|EU-level and international dimension of preparedness|Vital functions of society and the threats against them are part of a global operat- ing environment. Each vital function of society has an EU-level and international dimension when preparedness arrangements are developed for them. The process of forming the situation picture underlines the need for strengthening cooperation at EU and international level. Obligations laid down in the EU law and internation- al agreements that are binding on Finland are considered in the preparedness ar- rangements.|
|Monitoring and development of preparedness|Preparedness is systematically monitored and it is developed with such instru- ments as audits and training. Use of research information, findings of security-re- lated investigations and the use of the recommendations issued in them support the development of preparedness.|
|Dissemination of security information|The information on preparedness work and security must be as accessible as possible. However, for reasons of security, not all information can be widely disseminated.|

##### Leadership

### 1. Safeguarding the operating prerequisites of the state leadership

**Ministry in charge: Prime Minister’s Office**

**Task and objective**

Government decision-making is safeguarded by agreeing on the times and places of the government plenary sessions, presidential sessions, meetings of the cabinet committees and the unofficial meetings of
the government and by ensuring adequate communications between the meetings. The aim is to ensure
that decisions can be made quickly and in a flexible manner. Information on exceptional arrangements is
provided at correct times in accordance with agreed operating models.

**Operating model**

Cooperation between the Government, Parliament and the President of the Republic is carried out as required by law and in accordance with agreed cooperation practices. The suitability of the required premises as well as the appropriate functioning and development of technical systems and support organisations is ensured. The Prime Minister’s Office is responsible for the compilation of the Government’s joint
situation picture and the overall coordination of the management of incidents, the Government’s joint incident and emergency preparedness as well as the overall coordination between the declaration that an
emergency exists and the issuing of the implementation decree referred to in the Emergency Powers Act.

The Prime Minister’s Office is responsible for assisting the Prime Minister in the overall management
of the Government, coordinating the work of the Government and Parliament, coordinating the drafting and processing of the matters decided in the European Union, and the most important horizontal and institutional issues that are of major importance in the development of the European Union.

In the management of incidents, the emphasis is on cooperation between the parties in charge of the
situation, coordination, maintenance of the situation picture and communications. The capacity of other security actors to support leadership is also used, especially in the maintenance of the situation
picture and crisis communications. The Government’s ability to react to rapidly evolving and multifaceted incidents is developed through joint training and exercises arranged on a regular basis.


-----

### 2. Maintaining the situation picture of the state leadership

**Ministry in charge: Prime Minister’s Office**

**Task and objective**

Maintaining the situation picture of the state leadership is the strategic responsibility of the Prime Minister’s Office. The Government Situation Centre produces a proactive and real-time situation picture that
the state leadership can use in its decision-making. The purpose of the compilation of the situation picture is to ensure that an up-to-date and analysed picture of the security situation is available to the state
leadership in all circumstances.

**Operating model**

The task of the Government Situation Centre is to compile and analyse information on the security situation as well as on incidents and threats that endanger vital functions of society, to support the President
of the Republic and the Government in their decision-making. The situation picture is produced and kept
up-to-date throughout the incident. Notwithstanding secrecy provisions, for compiling the necessary situation picture, the Government Situation Centre has the right to obtain the information on security incidents that are deemed essential by the competent authority. The Government Situation Centre makes
the coordinated situation picture available to the President of the Republic, the Government and other
authorities. The analysed strategic-level situation picture based on continuous monitoring provides the
framework for decision-making and crisis management.

The operating models for the situation pictures of ministries and competent authorities and the IT solutions as well as analysis functions are harmonised so that information can be relayed quickly and in a secure manner. Cooperation to acquire information and to compile the situation picture will be intensified
and practised, giving consideration to necessary communications. National arrangements are partially
based on cooperation with the EU and other international actors.

### 3. Functioning of communications

**Ministries in charge:**
**Prime Minister’s Office and all other ministries**

**Task and objective**

Communications are part of the management process. Reliable, effective and correctly timed internal and
external communications are an essential part of the management of incidents and emergencies. Information is trusted if it is accurate, easy to understand, adequate and provided by competent authorities.

The Government is supported by communicative means in its work and decision-making. This includes
management of communications, coordination of communications between the authorities, providing
the citizens, the media and key stakeholders with reliable and up-to-date information as well as every
ministry’s responsibility for communications in its administrative branch. Resilience of citizens is strengthened and maintained through means of communications. Preparations for and responses to information
operations are based on close cooperation between the authorities and key stakeholders.

Planning and anticipation are essential to good communications. Planning is based on effectiveness and
the needs of the planner’s own organisation and the recipients. Warning people of known dangers and
rescuing them are the primary tasks of communications during incidents. In situations involving imminent
danger, the purpose of communications is to provide instructions. After the incident, communications are
needed for providing information about the repairs and reconstruction and to motivate actors to take part
in them. Providing more details of the causes and consequences of the crisis help citizens to understand
the situation, contribute to the recovery and help to make society better prepared for incidents.

**Operating model**

An adequate number of personnel is allocated and trained for crisis communications in central government. Priority in the development of communications is on strategic communications, services, tools and
communications channels. Attention is also on the development of research activities supporting crisis
management and communications. At the same time, communications preparedness of companies, other bodies and organisations supporting public administration in incidents and emergencies will be further
improved through training and exercises. The ability of different actors to identify information operations,
analyse them and respond to them quickly plays a central role in this process.

### 4. Finland’s role in the European Union; ensuring that EU matters can
**be properly drafted and considered at national level and securing**
**solidarity and mutual assistance**

**Ministries in charge:**
**Prime Minister’s Office and all other ministries**

**Task and objective**

Functioning of Finland’s national system of EU coordination is safeguarded so that it allows Finland to take
part in EU decision-making at the right time and in an effective manner. The Prime Minister is in charge
of the Government activities, is responsible for coordinating the drafting and processing of the matters
decided in the European Union in the Government as well as represents Finland in the European Council.
Each ministry is responsible for EU matters in its own area of responsibility. The Government EU Affairs
Department in the Prime Minister’s Office coordinates the drafting and processing of the matters decided
in the European Union. Parliament also has a key role in the national drafting of EU matters.

The solidarity and mutual defence provisions of the EU are binding on Finland. Finland can provide and
receive assistance, including military assistance, in accordance with the goals and principles laid down
in the United Nations Charter and other rules of international law. Under the Solidarity Clause of the
Treaty of Lisbon (Article 222 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union), the Union and
its Member States shall act jointly in a spirit of solidarity if a Member State is the object of a terrorist
attack or the victim of a natural or man-made disaster. Furthermore, under Article 42(7) of the Treaty on European Union, if a Member State is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other
Member States shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power.
Cooperation with ministries and other key actors, such as the Red Cross, plays a central role in international assistance and in the reception of the assistance.

**Operating model**

There have been changes in the international security environment. EU membership is of key importance
to Finland, both in terms of internal and external security. EU Member States have become increasingly
interdependent in both internal and external security matters. Multisectoral incidents and crises are becoming more common. Finland is committed to strengthening EU cooperation in internal and external security and in defence so that the Union and its citizens can be protected. The links between the internal
and external security of the Union must be strengthened. From Finland’s perspective, it is essential to continue the development of EU in the manner that guarantees its unity.


-----

Finland is working for closer cooperation in the EU so that incidents and crises can be anticipated, prevented and managed more effectively. Member States can rely on a number of arrangements for incidents and crises that are based on cooperation and solidarity, including the measures based on the
solidarity and mutual defence clauses. Coordination and practices at EU level must be further developed. It is essential to apply different tools effectively and avoid overlaps. When necessary, Finland must
be able to make quick decisions, and for this reason, it must maintain national preparedness to take
part in all areas of EU cooperation during incidents and crises. Finland supports the measures taken as
part of the integrated political crisis response of the EU (IPCR) so that the EU can support its Member
States in crisis management in an effective manner. The Government Situation Centre acts as the Finnish contact point for situations in which the IPCR and the EU’s civil protection mechanism are applied.

### 5. Developing contacts and cooperation with foreign countries and key
**international actors**

**Ministries in charge:**
**Ministry for Foreign Affairs and all other ministries**
**in their own areas of responsibility**

**Task and objective**

Finland will maintain and develop international contacts and cooperation with foreign countries and key
international actors, using its own network of missions. By continuously updating the international situation picture and by engaging in bilateral and multilateral cooperation, Finland will support security and
stability internationally and in its neighbouring regions as well as its own security and stability.

**Operating model**

The Ministry for Foreign Affairs in general and other ministries in their own areas of responsibility take
part in international activities and cooperation. In order to implement this, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs
maintains and develops an effective and appropriately dimensioned network of diplomatic and consular missions in relevant locations, providing expertise in several areas. In addition to maintaining contacts
with the authorities in their host countries and international organisations, the missions work in close
cooperation with a number of partners, especially the European External Action Service, other EU Member States and the missions of other important countries in Finland’s reference group. Business operators
and organisations on the one hand and the authorities on the other collect and relay information to each
other. International organisations, especially the World Health Organization (WHO), relay information on
health threats to their member countries. Under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), which
are binding on the member countries of the WHO, the WHO may direct its member states in health emergencies so that the population can be protected and any unnecessary disruptions to transport and trade
can be prevented.

### 6. International crisis management, humanitarian assistance and
**international rescue operations**

**Ministries in charge:**
**Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defence,**
**Ministry of the Interior, Prime Minister’s Office,**
**Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, Ministry of Justice**

**Task and objective**

Finland takes part in international civilian and military crisis management operations in accordance with
the principles of comprehensive crisis management. The aim of the international crisis management operations is to prevent, resolve and contain crises in the regions of their origin. The aim is also to prevent
large-scale migration and the spread of terrorism. In addition to having foreign and security policy objectives, military crisis management also helps the Finnish Defence Forces to develop its own performance
and capabilities. In its own crisis management operations, Finland promotes more extensive participation
of women in the building of peace and security. Finland provides humanitarian aid and takes part in international assistance and rescue operations. Humanitarian aid functions as a channel for providing urgent
aid to victims of crises and catastrophes, with focus on vulnerable groups. The provision and reception of
humanitarian assistance and the targeting of the aid takes place on the basis of the aid needs and in accordance with humanitarian principles.

**Operating model**

The comprehensive approach to crisis management is promoted through cooperation between administrative branches (Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defence and Ministry of the Interior). The Ministry for Foreign Affairs is in charge of the strategic-level coordination group established to facilitate this
cooperation. In crisis management, humanitarian aid and rescue operations, there is cooperation with
the Crisis Management Centre Finland, administrative branch of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health,
international organisations and civil society. Among the organisations, the Red Cross and especially its disaster response units, material preparedness and human resources provide the authorities with support
in crises occurring in Finland. When receiving and giving aid, the units act independently, in keeping with
the principles of the movement. Smooth cooperation between administrative branches and other actors
will ensure that military and civilian crisis management, development cooperation and humanitarian aid
are coordinated to achieve optimal synergies and lasting effects.

Finland will actively contribute to international humanitarian assistance and international rescue work. In
humanitarian aid and international rescue operations, the authorities work in close cooperation with different parts of the UN system, the European Union civil protection mechanism, independent aid organisations and other countries. Support and assistance provided by Finland for other countries and international organisations is relayed through appropriate international channels. Using these same channels,
Finland itself may request international assistance for rescue operations.


-----

### 7. Providing Finnish citizens and foreigners permanently residing in
**Finland with protection and assistance outside Finland**

**Ministry in charge:** **Ministry for Foreign Affairs**

**Task and objective**

Finland maintains the capacity to protect and assist Finnish communities, Finnish citizens and the foreigners referred to in the Consular Services Act when they need protection and assistance outside Finland’s
borders.

**Operating model**

Finland maintains adequate consular services and capacity and an effective on-call and alert system. Finland’s diplomatic and consular missions must have up-to-date contingency and evacuation plans and
smoothly functioning contacts with the authorities in their host countries as well as with the missions
of Nordic countries, EU Member States and the EU. The Prime Minister’s Office, Ministry of the Interior,
Ministry of Social Affairs and Health and the sectoral authorities operating under these ministries are the
most important central government partners in this area. Contacts are also maintained with business operators and organisations, such as the Red Cross, when those in need of assistance are provided with aid.
Contacts with governments of other countries are also maintained, as necessary. Appropriate data communications solutions safeguard the capacity of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to receive information and
to provide travellers with information.

The consular protection directive of the EU, which will enter into force by May 2018, will clarify the responsibilities of EU Member States in the provision of consular services for citizens of other Member
States.

### 8. Ensuring a smooth flow of goods and services between Finland and
**other countries**

**Ministries in charge:**
**Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Economic Affairs and**
**Employment, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry,**
**Ministry of Transport and Communications, Ministry of Finance**

**Task and objective**

The exports and imports essential for the livelihood of the population and industrial operations are safeguarded in all circumstances. Finland safeguards the prerequisites for foreign trade and access to strategic
products in compliance with the EU trade policy regulation.

**Operating model**

When the security situation so requires, the authorities will conduct discussions with officials in other EU
Member States and the European Commission on such national measures that would have an impact on
other aspects of the single European market or foreign trade.

In exceptional situations (such as disruptions to EU trade policy), the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Ministry of Transport and
Communications, Ministry of Finance and the Finnish Customs will act as the responsible authorities.
These parties will cooperate closely in order to ensure that Finland’s objectives concerning trade policy,
safeguarding of foreign trade and the uniformity of the decisions on the European single market are met.
The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health will make the appropriate arrangements for granting insurance
guarantees in emergencies.


-----

##### Defence capability

### 9. Finland’s military defence

**Ministry in charge: Ministry of Defence**

**Task and objective**

The use of military force against Finland and the threat of it will be prevented. A military attack against Finland will be repelled, if necessary. Finland will make preparations to receive military assistance.

**Operating model**

Finland will maintain a defence capability proportioned to its operating environment and a capability to
repel military threats, which is based on high-performance weapons systems and a large reserve. The
prime purpose of the immediate response force equipped with effective and up-to-date systems and consisting of troops from all services is to prevent the situation from escalating into the use of military force
against Finland. If the situation so requires, the focal point of defence will be established and an attack
against Finland repelled. In a prolonged or escalating crisis, additional troops will be established, if necessary.

The Finnish Border Guard will take part in the defence of Finland. If the situation so requires, troops of
the Finnish Border Guard will be incorporated into the Defence Forces. The Finnish Border Guard will carry out its defence planning and preparations in close cooperation with the Defence Forces. Partnerships,
co-operation between the authorities and society’s support for military defence are organised on a contractual basis and through cooperation arrangements and exercises agreed in advance.

Every effort is made to ensure that citizens’ will to defend Finland remains high. The National Defence
Training Association of Finland (on the basis of the Act on Voluntary National Defence 556/2007) serves
as part of the reserve training system, as a strategic partner of the Finnish Defence Forces, as a partner
in the training for local defence and mutual administrative support, and a partner in the recruitment of
volunteers.


-----

##### Internal security

### 10. [Ensuring legal protection]

**Task and objective**


**Ministry in charge: Ministry of Justice**


The system of legal protection must function properly in all circumstances. This means that the provisions
on citizens’ rights and obligations must be laid down in the law and the powers of the authorities must
have a legal basis. Sentencing and settling of disputes are the responsibility of an independent judiciary.
The enforcement of criminal sanctions is the responsibility of the criminal sanctions authorities. The principles of the rule of law are observed in all circumstances and basic and human rights are safeguarded.

**Operating model**

The powers and resources of the law enforcement and judicial authorities are maintained at the level required by the changing operating environment and the tasks. Laws and operating models have been established for quick processing of cases in courts and the readiness to use these instruments is maintained
and, if necessary, raised through training and exercises. As part of this readiness, the prosecution service
can provide on-duty services and act more quickly in urgent cases.

The data security and functioning of the critical information systems of the justice administration required
for law enforcement and courts must be ensured in all circumstances. This will be promoted by improving
the data systems and operations of courts and other bodies of the justice administration. The safety of
the court premises must be further improved. This will be a particular consideration in the development
of the district court network and in other premises projects. Courts must also be provided with the necessary human resources and the competence of the judges must be ensured in exceptional situations and
as information systems and technology are changing. The availability, adequacy and quality of the interpretation and translation services required by courts must be ensured in cooperation with the authorities
responsible for the training.

Internal risks in prisons are considered when the purpose of the institutions is determined. In the legislation on the conditions and treatment of prisoners, consideration is given to international agreements
and the obligations based on them. In the new strategic thinking, contingency planning in prisons and the
associated preparedness for emergencies are based on the principle of on-site protection during threats
of war and armed attack. In civilian crisis situations, the instructions issued by the rescue authorities are
observed. A unit-specific preparedness plan will be drawn up for each prison.


-----

### 11. [Holding elections and safeguarding the prerequisites of democracy]

**Ministry in charge: Ministry of Justice**

**Task and objective**

The prerequisites for holding general elections in accordance with the law are safeguarded in all security situations. At the same time, the preparedness for holding early general elections is maintained at all
times. The organisation for holding the elections and the required data systems are maintained and election material is provided in accordance with relevant requirements. These include special functionality,
timing and security requirements.

Every effort is made to safeguard the operating prerequisites of political parties and the payment of party
subsidies in crisis situations. Organisations can create society-internal pull factors during crises and in this
manner strengthen security and support the authorities. A dialogue between the authorities and organisations is maintained and every effort is made to safeguard the operating prerequisites of organisations
in crisis situations.

**Operating model**

In addition to the Ministry of Justice and the Legal Register Centre, these preparedness requirements also
apply to electoral district committees, municipal election authorities, the Population Register Centre and
local register offices. The Ministry of Justice and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs cooperate in the arrangements under which Finns residing abroad can take part in the elections. The Ministry of Justice maintains
preparedness in the field of funding, communications and data systems concerning the elections. Preparations for holding early general elections are part of the training and exercises.

Citizens’ opportunities to take part in civic activities will be safeguarded by providing everybody access to
up-to-date information, which enhances chances for civic engagement. In addition to the elections, the
Ministry of Justice will also work to safeguard electronic democracy services, to ensure that citizens and
municipal residents can submit initiatives, and that consultation processes can be carried out as part of
statute drafting. The Ministry will maintain communications preparedness as part of democracy services.


-----

### 12. [Maintaining public order and security ]

**Ministry in charge: Ministry of the Interior**

**Task and objective**

The police are responsible for maintaining public order and security, and by providing mutual administrative support, the police also assist other authorities in the performance of their tasks. Maintaining public
order and security protects the basic infrastructure of society, prevents terrorism, organized crime and
other serious crime as well as serious disorderly conduct. An effective pre-trial investigation and crime
prevention system helps to combat crime and maintain social stability. The investigation of serious accidents, offence-based acts and other irregular events is an effective instrument in the efforts to prevent
such incidents from reoccurring and acts as a deterrence.

**Operating model**

The capability of the police to immediately intervene in threats and offences will be improved. This helps
to prevent serious disturbances affecting society and to combat offences endangering citizens’ basic
rights, foundations of society and the economy. The powers, training, tools and equipment of the law enforcement authorities are maintained at the level required by the operating environment and the tasks.
Other security authorities, especially the Finnish Border Guard, Finnish Customs and the Finnish Defence
Forces, support the police in this task. The cooperation in crime prevention also involves a number of other actors.

Cooperation between the law enforcement authorities, especially the police, Finnish Customs and the
Finnish Border Guard, in the combating of crime will be intensified. The statutory basis and structures of
the reserve police system will be developed so that the reserve police could also better support the security authorities during incidents occurring in normal conditions. In order to combat terrorism, a situation
picture of the terrorist activities threatening Finland, potential targets and the high-risk individuals staying in Finland or threatening Finland will be established. Capabilities of the police counter-terrorism units,
technical capabilities and the legislative basis will be maintained at the level required by the situation picture. The special capabilities and equipment of the Finnish Border Guard and the Finnish Defence Forces
will be used and developed in cooperation with the police.


-----

### 13. [Ensuring border security]

**Task and objective**


**Ministry in charge: Ministry of the Interior**


The Finnish Border Guard is responsible for maintaining Finland’s border security. Maintenance of border security helps to prevent the violation of the provisions on the crossing of the national border and
the threats against public order and security arising from cross-border passenger traffic, to combat transboundary crime and to ensure the safety and smooth flow of cross-border traffic. It also helps to ensure
Finland’s territorial integrity. Maintenance of border security strengthens Finland’s security and provides
an effective tool for combating the security threats facing Finland and other European countries. Resilience and the capability to deal with rapidly evolving security situations remains high.

**Operating model**

Security threats are jointly combated by the authorities under the coordination of the Finnish Border
Guard. The operating model is based on the four-tier access control model under the European concept
of integrated border management. Illegal immigration is combated by means of liaisons and international
cooperation and the process starts in the countries of origin and transit. Measures enhancing stability on
Finnish borders are developed in cooperation with Russia and other key countries. As part of the border
controls based on a risk analysis, Finland will develop the capability to identify and influence new security
threats using the latest technology in the process. Safety of cross-border traffic will be ensured with smart
border control technology and adequate infrastructure. Surveillance on Finland’s eastern border will be
strengthened and the additional border security obligations laid out by the EU will be implemented. Measures will be taken to combat the serious crime connected with illegal immigration and large-scale illegal
immigration will be kept under control through cooperation between the authorities and with preparedness arrangements. The capacity to transfer resources, reinstate internal border controls, and to respond
to serious border security incidents and other security threats will be maintained at high level. The capacity to receive European assistance, especially Frontex border security operations, will be improved. The
capacity, powers and performance of the Finnish Border Guard is used in the surveillance and safeguarding of Finland’s territorial integrity. The key authorities in the process are the Finnish Border Guard, the
police and Finnish Customs, in cooperation with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Transport and Communications, Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, Finnish
Immigration Service, Finnish Transport Agency, Finnish Transport Safety Agency, regions and the Finnish
Red Cross.


-----

### 14. [Ensuring the safety of supply chains and safety of goods]

**Ministry in charge: Ministry of Finance**

**Task and objective**

The primary aim in the work to ensure the safety of the supply chain is to reduce the likelihood of security threats and the likelihood of them becoming reality. In practice this means extensive measures, such
as security checks in air traffic. In addition to carrying out security controls, the key authorities must also
prepare for security incidents and situations involving security threats.

The Finnish Customs may grant Finnish companies the status of authorised economic operators (AEO) under the global corporate security programme managed by national customs authorities. The purpose of
the AEO programme is to enhance the security and reliability of cross-border transport operations and
supply chains.

Maintenance of the safety of goods covers all types of goods carried with different modes of transport,
goods transported in foreign trade, and items carried by passengers. It also includes the identification
of security threats, preparedness arrangements and reactions in such areas as the surveillance of CBRNE agents. In these situations, work is carried out to prepare for chemical (C), biological (B), radiological
(R), nuclear (N) and explosives-related threats (E) and to develop capabilities to respond to these threats.

**Operating model**

Safety of the supply chains is based on anticipatory risk management in commercial traffic and identification of reliable operators. Risk management allows the identification of illegal operators by sector and
mode of transport as well as the identification of any security deviations in the supply chain.

The work to maintain the safety of goods in the Finnish foreign trade is coordinated by the Finnish Customs on the basis of cooperation between a large number of different authorities. Even though the focus
is on preventive measures as well as physical and risk-based surveillance, it is also important to prepare
for situations involving security threats. This work is carried out in cooperation with other authorities.
The key authorities in this cooperation are the Finnish Border Guard, the police, Finnish Transport Safety
Agency, the Finnish Defence Forces and the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority, in cooperation with
the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Transport and Communications, Ministry of Social Affairs and Health as well as the regions.


-----

### 15. [Civil defence]

**Task and objective**


**Ministry in charge:  Ministry of the Interior**


The aim is to protect the lives and health of the Finnish population in all security situations. The overall
aim in civil defence is to protect the population in accidents and other dangerous situations occurring in
normal conditions so that there is no loss of human life.

**Operating model**

During armed conflicts, preparations will be made to protect the population in civil defence shelters, in
premises yielding maximum protection or through evacuations in accordance with risk assessments and
threat situations.

Finland is facing a potential military threat. For this reason, the civilian sector must have contingency
plans and make advance preparations for a situation where this threat is realised. The building of civil defence shelters will continue and the main purpose is to prepare for military threats. Ministries and other
authorities will prepare for the civil defence tasks laid down in the Geneva Conventions in their areas of
responsibility. Civil defence methods will be developed and their organisation will be considered in all preparedness planning. For example, evacuation plans will be kept up to date. Operating models used by the
authorities and the division of labour between them will be developed by holding preparedness exercises.
Organisations will play an important role in independent preparedness, such as the training of the security officials of housing companies and other bodies and in communications. The division of responsibilities
between different actors, such as the authorities, organisations, citizens and business operators, must be
clear and communicated to all actors.

The activities are based on networked and coordinated cooperation. Each authority is responsible for
these activities within its own competence. All authorities responsible for these tasks take part in the cooperation between the authorities and the cooperation is coordinated by the Ministry of the Interior. Ministries, central government agencies, organisations and business operators are key actors in this work. Cooperation between public administration and business operators in security of supply will be developed
within the framework of the emergency supply organisation.


-----

### 16. [Ensuring the maritime search and rescue capability ]

**Ministry in charge:  Ministry of the Interior**

**Task and objective**

The capability of Finland’s maritime search rescue services to deal with its tasks, ranging from minor maritime search and rescue assignments to major accidents and compound accidents, will be ensured. The
aim is to allocate urgent and appropriate assistance for the search and rescue of people in danger in Finland’s maritime search and rescue area of responsibility, provide the rescued people with the necessary
first aid and manage the radio communications and dissemination of information required in dangerous
situations. Every effort is made to anticipate accidents, to prevent accidents from escalating and to minimise the damage arising from them.

**Operating model**

Appropriate capability will be ensured through active cooperation between the authorities, which is coordinated by the Finnish Border Guard, and by using voluntary organisations. Unified national operating
models based on the operating models laid out in the mass rescue operation plan (MoMeVa) and the operating plans and models supplementing it will be created through preparedness planning. Finland will
conduct exercises with the neighbouring countries on an active basis and works to develop cooperation
with them. In maritime search and rescue operations taking place outside the archipelago, Finland will
also make effective use of foreign maritime search and rescue units.

The actors taking part in maritime search and rescue operations and their tasks are laid down in the Maritime Search and Rescue Act (1145/2001). Under the act, the Finnish Border Guard is the authority in
charge of maritime search and rescue operations. Other key actors include other rescue authorities, social welfare and health care authorities and voluntary maritime search and rescue organisations (Finnish
Lifeboat Institution and the Åland Lifeboat Society). Such actors as the Finnish Transport Agency, Finnish
Transport Safety Agency, the police, Finnish Customs, Finnish Defence Forces, environmental authorities,
Finnish Meteorological Institute and the Finnish Red Cross are also involved in maritime search and rescue
work. State-owned companies operating in sea areas and Air Navigation Services, which provides flight
route and air navigation services, also take part in maritime search and rescue work.


-----

### 17. [Emergency response centres]

**Ministries in charge:**
**Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Social Affairs and Health**

**Task and objective**

The task of the Emergency Response Centre Administration is to provide emergency response services.

As part of their work, emergency response centres support the rescue services, the police, social welfare
and health care, Finnish Border Guard and other actors assisting them. This includes the measures pertaining to the relaying of notifications and assignment of tasks, communications centre tasks, initiating
public warning measures in sudden danger and other tasks pertaining to the support of the authorities.

The Emergency Response Centre Administration provides high-quality emergency response services by
operating in a networked manner and by using modern technology. The aim is to develop cooperation
between emergency response centres, command and situation centres operated by the authorities and
field centres as well as the services provided by them so that the emergency response centres and the
authorities taking part in the emergency response centre operations can act on a joint basis. This helps
to strengthen the resilience of the entire assistance chain and to secure the continuity of the authorities’
work during incidents.

**Operating model**

The work of the emergency response centres is steered and supervised by the Ministry of the Interior. The
Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health are jointly responsible for the operational steering of the Emergency Response Centre Administration.

The Emergency Response Centre Administration operates as a national agency, with the whole of Mainland Finland as its area of responsibility. The Emergency Response Centre Administration has six operating
points, which can replace each other if necessary.


-----

### 18. [Maintaining rescue services]

**Ministry in charge:  Ministry of the Interior**

**Task and objective**

Rescue services are responsible for the measures required in accidents affecting human lives, property and
the environment and for preventing such accidents. The responsibility ranges from everyday incidents to
major disasters and to emergency preparedness. Rescue authorities manage the supervisory duties coming under their area of responsibility and they are also responsible for promoting accident prevention work.

On a statutory basis, rescue services are also responsible for such tasks as first response, oil spill response
and a range of supervisory tasks in the field of chemical safety. They also provide assistance in maritime
search and rescue operations. Many regional rescue departments also provide emergency medical services.

The structures and resources of the rescue services system have been planned and built on the basis of
risks occurring during normal conditions and the threat assessments drawn up for emergencies. Rescue
services are prepared to give and receive assistance in accidents and disasters at the request of the EU,
other international organisations or other states. The aim is to make more extensive use of the resources
of the rescue services in society and in support of other authorities, nationally and internationally.

In their capacity as internal security actors, rescue services contribute to the preparedness of society for
incidents and catastrophes in all circumstances (including emergencies).

**Operating model**

Rescue services help to improve the security of society and prevent accidents through education, training and advice. At the same time, they perform their rescue service tasks and maintain their operational
capability, contribute to the improvement and maintenance of civilian preparedness and work to contain
the consequences of accidents. Rescue services strengthen the ability of individuals and communities to
reduce accidents, and they work to encourage individuals and communities to show initiative and act in
a responsible manner.

Rescue services are directed, steered and supervised by the Ministry of the Interior. Rescue services are
regionally organised so that rescue departments manage the responsibilities of the rescue services in
their regions. The services provided by rescue services are provided as processes crossing organisational boundaries and in cooperation with other actors. Resources of the third sector and business operators are used in rescue services. Organisations, contractual bodies and the voluntary sector provide and
support rescue services and rescue preparedness. Fire brigades, Finnish Lifeboat Institution, Finnish Red
Cross, Finnish Air Rescue Society, rescue dog organisations, and the Voluntary Rescue Service Vapepa are
the key actors in this work.

The work of the rescue services in emergencies is based on the arrangements made for normal conditions, and additional resources are provided in accordance with plans drawn up in advance. Staff are
trained in advance for duties to be performed in emergencies.


-----

### 19. [Immigration control ]

**Task and objective**


**Ministries in charge:**
**Ministry of the Interior, Ministry for Foreign Affairs,**
**Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment**


Immigration controls allow Finland to regulate the flow of immigrants, make the appropriate decisions
pertaining to immigration and maintain the capacity to prevent illegal immigration. In order to keep immigration at targeted levels, it is important to ensure an adequate number of permit processing personnel
in the immigrant administration and to ensure more effective cooperation between immigration authorities. The overall reception costs must correspond to the number of asylum seekers and the shortening of
the processing times. The placement of applicants granted asylum in municipalities and the removal from
Finland of those issued with a negative decision must also be speeded up. Removing of persons staying illegally in Finland from the country is an essential tool in the prevention and combating of illegal immigration. The removals should be on the basis of voluntary return.

Integration of immigrants is important from the perspective of security. Inadequate integration of immigrants has a negative impact on such areas as internal security. Good relations between different population groups, interaction, positive attitudes and the sense of security and inclusion help to promote
bidirectional integration in communities and society at large. There should be particular attention on individuals in danger of social exclusion so that they could be included in the system of integration support.

The level of the immigrant control tasks must be such that the official immigration measures (including
the surveillance of foreigners), the prerequisites for decisions on the applications submitted on the basis
of the Aliens Act, and the applicants’ legal protection are not endangered. Finland must continue to be
able to promote the immigration of such individuals that it needs in order to ensure its competitiveness
and to safeguard the functioning of the welfare society. It is important to ensure the smoothness of the
immigration permit process in a situation where Finland is competing for the special experts that it needs.

**Operating model**

In addition to the administrative branch of the Ministry of the Interior, decision-making and activities concerning immigration also involve the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Justice,
Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment, Ministry of Social Affairs and Health and the Ministry of
Education and Culture. Regional and local administration as well as organisations have their own roles in
immigrant control. Successful control of migration requires international cooperation. As it is specifically a
question of movement of people between countries, successful control of immigration requires close contacts with actors in the neighbouring regions, as well as the immigrants’ countries of origin and countries
of transit. Good operational partnerships are particularly important when individuals are removed from
the country and in other similar situations.


-----

### 20. [ Management of large-scale immigration ]

**Ministries in charge:**
**Ministry of the Interior and**
**Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment**

**Task and objective**

A situation with large-scale immigration may arise and escalate as a result of a sudden mass exodus into
Finland from another country. In such situations, the number of immigrants may exceed 20,000 and it will
not be possible to register the newcomers using the normal procedure. As a result, one or more reception
centres must be established for the purpose. The aim is to ensure that the accommodation of the immigrants and other reception services, such as food supply as well as social welfare and health care services,
can be provided immediately after the entry into Finland. The speed of the asylum decision-making process and the prerequisites for expanding the reception system must be safeguarded.

**Operating model**

The Finnish Immigration Service is steered by the Ministry of the Interior, which ensures that the agency
has the required resources for performing its core tasks, including preparedness for exceptional immigration situations. The Ministry of the Interior also steers the ELY Centres in the preparedness for large-scale
immigration. In addition to the ELY Centres, a broad range of different authorities, such as the police, Finnish Border Guard, Finnish Defence Forces, Regional State Administrative Agencies, social welfare, health
care and rescue authorities, Social Insurance Institution of Finland and organisations take part in the
preparation and implementation of extensive immigrant preparedness plans and in the compilation of a
situation picture within the framework of regional cooperation groups.

The Finnish Immigration Service has an agreement with the Finnish Red Cross on support services concerning the reception of asylum seekers and on the maintenance of a continuous reception preparedness
based on special expertise. Under the agreement, preparations will also be taken for large-scale immigration in support of the national reception system. The Finnish Immigration Service and the police also have
joint arrangements under which reception centres can be established.

The national coordination of the preparation for large-scale immigration will become the responsibility of
the Finnish Immigration Service on 1 January 2020. Under the new arrangements, the agency will operate
in cooperation with region-level actors. Regions would become obliged to draw up preparedness plans for
large-scale immigration as cross-administrative cooperation with other actors.

### 21. [Environmental emergency response ]

**Ministries in charge:**
**Ministry of the Environment, Ministry of Transport and**
**Communications, Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment,**
**Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Defence**

**Task and objective**

Every effort will be made to respond effectively to oil spills occurring on land and in water areas, prevent damage
arising from the discharges of other hazardous substances and environmental accidents caused by vessels and to
contain the damage arising from them. Environmental emergency response capability is maintained at high level.
In order to successfully carry out this task, the actors involved cooperate with other authorities in the development of vessel safety regulations, and monitoring, control and steering systems for maritime traffic.

**Operating model**

Measures will be taken to respond to oil spills on land and to prevent discharges or other dangerous substances through effective risk management during the transport chain and in the production facilities. Permit requirements are imposed on the operators and compliance with them is verified on a regular basis.
Storage keepers and ports must purchase equipment for preventing and containing the damage and draw
up emergency response plans. Companies must test the functioning of the plans, both independently and
in cooperation with the rescue authorities. Cooperation between the authorities and companies will be expanded and developed to ensure better response to accidents involving hazardous substances.

An effective vessel traffic control system reduces the oil and chemical spills arising from vessels. Capabilities to detect accidents, to quickly contain their impacts and repair the damage arising from them will be
developed. The Finnish Environment Institute SYKE will maintain 24/7 duty readiness for different types of
environmental accidents. In open sea, the environmental emergency response is based on multi-purpose
vessels. The respond capacity will be improved through purchases that help Finnish actors to combat environmental damage in darkness and in shallow waters more effectively. The Finnish Border Guard will have
a stronger role in the operational command of the work to combat environmental damage in sea areas. In
cooperation with the neighbouring countries, Finland will develop joint practices for accident situations and
assess the adequacy of the oil recovery equipment in the region. Cooperating with the European Maritime
Safety Agency (EMSA), Finland will maintain a service network of chemicals experts and a satellite image
service for detecting oil spills.

The Government is in the process of drafting a proposal under which the command, steering and supervision of the response to oil and chemical spills from vessels would be transferred to the Ministry of the Interior
from the start of 2019. The Ministry of the Environment would still have tasks that are connected with environmental damage legislation, restoration, remediation and steering of waste management in exceptional situations. Under the Government proposal, the Finnish Border Guard would be responsible for response to oil
and chemical spills from vessels occurring in Finnish territorial waters and the Finnish economic zone and for
coordination of the response preparedness. Regional rescue departments are responsible for oil and chemical


-----

spill response in their areas of responsibility. As part of the regional government reform, it will be ensured that
the obligation of the regional rescue departments to respond to oil spills will remain in place and that their
response preparedness will remain high. The Finnish Transport Safety Agency and the Finnish Defence Forces
(Navy) also take part in the combating of oil and chemical spills from vessels. The Finnish Safety and Chemicals Agency (TUKES), which comes under the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment, issues permits for
large-scale chemicals and explosives establishments and supervises their operations. The Finnish Customs is
responsible for chemicals control in foreign trade of goods. The overall steering of the prevention of environmental damage that may occur during transport is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Municipalities are responsible for the post-spill clean-up. The third sector has an operating model
for oil spill response, in which the organisations take part in the on-shore response and support the work by
recruiting personnel and by training committed volunteers under the guidance of the responsible authorities.

### 22. [Preparedness for biological threats]

**Ministries in charge:**
**Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, Ministry of Agriculture and**
**Forestry, Ministry of Defence, Ministry for Foreign Affairs,**
**Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of the Environment**

**Task and objective**

A biological threat means a situation where a microbe or a biological material causes a large number of people
to become ill and the outbreak cannot be managed with measures or resources normally available to health
care. A biological threat may also arise because microbes or toxins (poisons produced by living organisms) are
spread deliberately with criminal intent (bioharassment, bioterrorism or biological warfare).

Many of the known and new microbes causing serious epidemics and pandemics originate from wild animals from which they are transmitted to humans and production animals. For this reason, cooperation between human, environmental and animal health sectors in the preparedness and response to the threats is
important. As pandemics burden the entire health care system, the support of other health safety authorities is also needed so that the security of supply can be guaranteed. In the preparedness and response to
deliberate spreading, the police and the Finnish Customs (Ministry of Finance), the Ministry for Foreign Affairs (export control of dual-use products or non-proliferation), and defence authorities (arms exports and
preparedness for the use of biological weapons) also play an important role.

There are a number of international agreements and commitments guiding the preparedness for biological
threats. For example, under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), biological, chemical, radiological and unknown threats that may be hazardous to human or animal life must be identified and combated.
If there is a danger that the health threat may spread outside a country’s borders, other countries must be
notified within 24 hours. Under the Biological Weapons Convention, concluded under the auspices of the
United Nations, the State Parties may only use microbes and other biological substances (such as toxins)
for peaceful purposes. Under the UN Security Council Resolution 1540, states must prevent the spread of


-----

weapons of mass destruction and means of delivery to non-state criminal parties such as terrorists. Finland
has also been actively involved in the promotion of global health security by hosting the GHSA programme
in 2015 and by developing WHO mechanisms to support the IHR 2005.

For example, influenza pandemics have occurred at intervals of between 10 and 40 years. There are only
limited means of containing the spread of influenza. Development of a vaccine only starts with the outbreak of a pandemic caused by a new virus, which means that at least during the first six months, the outbreak must be contained using other measures. High hygienic standards, personal protective equipment
and instructions agreed in advance help to limit the spread of the illness. Currently used antiviral drugs can
shorten the duration of the illness and reduce the number of complications, which must be treated with antibiotics. This means that emergency and obligatory stockpiling plays a key role in the preparedness for pandemics, both in the public and private sectors.

A pandemic is a threat to the vital functions of society because a large number of persons will contract the
illness and many of them will die. In addition to the health care system, such areas as command systems,
Finnish Defence Forces, internal security, energy supply, transport and food supply may also be affected. For
this reason, sufficient preparedness measures must be taken in all administrative branches and at all administrative levels. Preparations for such incidents as influenza pandemics are described in the national preparedness plan 2012 of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health. There are also separate national instructions on material preparedness in health care (antiviral drugs, personal protective equipment, etc.).

**Operating model and actors**

Biological threats do not stop at geographic borders and preparations for them require international cooperation with such organisations as the WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).
Overall coordination of the combating of biological threats is the responsibility of the Ministry of Social Affairs
and Health and the ministry is supported in this work by the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL).
THL plays a key role in such areas as the monitoring of microbe infections and the clinical diagnostics of rare
and dangerous microbes and in its coordination. Other authorities as well as business operators, organisations
and citizens play a central role in the combating of the threats and in the reduction of the risks.

The Biothreat Unit, which is jointly maintained by the Finnish Defence Forces and the National Institute for
Health and Welfare, serves as the national expert organisation in bioprotection medicine and the control of
biological threats. It supports the combating of biological threats arising from the deliberate spreading of
micro-organisms and enhances nationwide awareness and preparedness cooperation in the sector. The Biothreat Unit is engaged in active cooperation at national and international level with other parties supporting
health security, such as the Finnish Food Safety Authority, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the police, universities and the Finnish Biosafety Network. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Finnish Food Safety
Authority operating under the ministry’s auspices are responsible for the combating of diseases transmitted through animals and foodstuffs. The Finnish Environment Institute provides mutual administrative support, as necessary. The Finnish Zoonosis Centre, jointly operated by the ministries, the Finnish Food Safety
Authority and the National Institute for Health and Welfare, is also responsible for the coordination of the
combating of biological threats. Based on an international evaluation, Finland will establish national steering arrangements, structures and processes allowing Finland to make preparations for biological threats, to
identify them and to react to them.

### 23. [ Preventing radiation hazards and preparing for them]

**Ministries in charge:**
**Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Social Affairs and Health,**
**Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Ministry of the Environment,**
**Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment**

**Task and objective**

An extensive radiation hazard impacting society at large will arise as a result of an accident in a nuclear
power plant in Finland or in the neighbouring region or a nuclear weapons explosion in Finland or in the
neighbouring region. Deliberate spreading of radioactive substances or nuclear material among the population will create a local radiation hazard that will have a strong impact on the functioning of society.

During the early stages of the radiation hazard, correctly timed decisions and protective measures must
be taken so that the safety of the population can be ensured and society’s functions can be maintained.
Managing the radiation hazard and the recovery from it may take decades. For the whole duration of the
hazard, there is a need for a joint situation picture, decisions based on it and consistent and easy-to-understand communications that help to minimise disruptions to society and business operations. By taking
correct decisions and measures, the parties involved are also able to control and minimise the radioactive
waste resulting from the decontamination measures.

**Operating model**

The main aim of the authorities is to prevent radiation hazards. The Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority, the Finnish Meteorological Institute, Finnish Customs, Finnish Food Safety Authority, National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health, Finnish Defence Forces and the transport authorities are the key
actors in this situation. The Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority supervises the operations of the users of nuclear energy and radiation and their preparedness to deal with different types of incidents. The
Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority also maintains a national radiation monitoring network that operates on a continuous basis. The main purpose of the radiation controls carried out in cooperation with
the Finnish Customs at border crossing points is to prevent the illegal imports of radioactive substances
and contaminated products.

International cooperation is key to the prevention of radiation hazards and preparations for them. Finland has ratified the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident, and the Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency of the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA). It has also bilateral agreements on communications in situations that may result in a radiation hazard with other Nordic countries, Russia, Ukraine and Germany. Finland is also a party to the information exchange system of the European Commission. This helps to ensure access to information in
radiation hazards that arise outside Finnish national borders but that may have an impact on Finland or
its residents.


-----

In radiation hazards, the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority will act as the expert agency and provide
recommendations and instructions so that safety can be ensured. Seeking shelter indoors is the primary
means of reducing radiation exposure and the decision on this is made by the official in charge of the rescue operations. If there is a high concentration of radioactive iodine in the air, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health will issue a decision under which, in addition to seeking shelter indoors, the population
should also take iodine pills. The authorities under the auspices of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will issue decisions on how to minimise the exposure through contaminated food. The Ministry of the
Environment guides the actors in its administrative branch on how to provide expert assistance on environmental protection and nature conservation during radiation hazards. The Ministry of Social Affairs and
Health follows the situation assessments produced by the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority and the
recommendations issued by the agency on the protective measures required for reducing the negative
impacts of radiation. If necessary, the ministry also provides other authorities (National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health, and Regional State Administrative Agencies) with instructions. The National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health guides the operations of the municipal health protection
authorities, while at the same time, Regional State Administrative Agencies coordinate the instructions in
the regions coming under them. During a radiation hazard, the National Supervisory Authority for Welfare
and Health issues regulations and guidelines on the safety of drinking water, indoor premises and living
environment on the basis of the recommendations issued by the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority.
At the end of the initial stage, which may last for days or even weeks, the responsibility for the protective
measures is transferred to the environmental health authorities, which work under the auspices of the
Ministry of Social Affairs and Health. In that situation, the National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and
Health may issue regulations and instructions on measures on the decontamination of indoor premises
and the living environment, restricting their use, safety of drinking water, and, if necessary, on restricting
its use. The instructions and regulations issued at this stage, which are based on the recommendations
of the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority, are intended to individual citizens, companies and the authorities. Municipal health protection authorities are responsible for ensuring at local level that the living environment (such as public buildings) does not cause any health hazards and that drinking water is
safe to use. Under the Health Protection Act, the National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health
may also issue municipalities with instructions and regulations on the organisation of waste management.

The measures taken during the recovery stage are based on the recommendations and advice issued by
the authorities and experts as well as on the local situation and social conditions. The competence of the
National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health in radiation hazards is based on section 52 of the
Health Protection Act. It has been proposed to transfer the competence to the Ministry of Social Affairs
and Health, as the tasks and resources of National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health under
the Health Protection Act will be transferred to the national permit and supervisory authority to be established as part of the regional government reform.

From the initial stages to the long-term recovery, successful cooperation between a large number of different authorities, business operators and civil society is important so that the measures are accepted by
the public and society at large, the exposure to radiation can be limited in an effective manner and the
negative impacts on society arising from the situation can be minimised.

### 24. [Preparation for chemical threats]

**Ministries in charge:**
**Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, Ministry of the Interior,**
**Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment,**
**Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Ministry of the Environment,**
**Ministry of Defence**

**Task and objective**

Observation and monitoring systems are maintained so that the hazardous situations arising from chemicals can be detected and managed. These systems are connected with the national expert steering systems for a chemical threat and the monitoring, warning and management systems of the WHO and the
EU, which support the national systems. Cooperation carried out within the framework of the International Health Regulations and with the Health Security Committee of the European Commission steer and
support the management of chemical risks. The equipment, technical systems, expertise and human resources required for the detection and management of chemical threat factors are maintained in accordance with the changes in the operating environment and threat scenarios.

Preparations for unexpected chemical emissions arising without warning and the potential health threats
resulting from them as well as the assessments of the threats are based on the responsibilities and expertise of individual authorities and experts. As the responsibilities are decentralised, cooperation between the authorities and experts is essential. For this reason, there is emphasis on cooperation networks
the aim of which is to ensure the flow of information and increase cooperation between administrative
branches and experts.

**Operating model and actors**

At local level, local rescue authorities, Finnish Border Guard, the police and the environmental protection and health protection authorities are the authorities with immediate responsibility for action in sudden chemical hazards. Environmental protection authorities are in charge of the operations in situations
where chemicals have polluted or are suspected to have polluted the soil and the groundwater. Health
protection authorities are in charge of the operations in situations where hazardous chemicals have entered the water supply network, soil or groundwater, causing a health hazard to the population. In situations where an offence is suspected, the responsibility for managing the situation lies with the police,
while in sudden chemicals emissions, the rescue authorities are in charge of the rescue operations. Food
safety authorities are in charge of the situations where hazardous chemicals found in foodstuffs may endanger public health.

Finland’s chemicals safety legislation is largely based on EU legislation. Enforcement of the provisions
and supervision of compliance is divided between ministries and the authorities coming under them. The
Finnish Safety and Chemicals Agency (Tukes), Finnish Food Safety Authority, National Supervisory Author

-----

ity for Welfare and Health, Finnish Transport Safety Agency, Finnish Customs, the police, Finnish Border
Guard, Finnish Defence Forces, rescue authorities, Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority and occupational safety and health authorities are all key actors in chemicals safety in their own areas of responsibility. The authorities are also supported by expert and research agencies such as the National Institute
for Health and Welfare, Finnish Institute of Occupational Health (FIOH), the Finnish Environment Institute
and the National Resources Institute Finland. Expertise in sudden health hazards arising from chemicals
is also provided by the Poison Information Centre, which comes under the Ministry of Social Affairs and
Health.

Local level authorities have been issued with guidelines that also contain instructions on how to prepare
for situations involving chemical threats. There are also guidelines for specific chemicals for use in chemicals emissions. The Centre of Excellence for Serious Chemical Threats is a cooperation network operating
in the administrative branch of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, which supports the authorities in
the preparation for complex chemical threats and their management. The Finnish Institute of Occupational Health and the National Institute for Health and Welfare maintain a 24/7 expert service for assessing
and managing chemical threats, which is intended for local level authorities. The aim of the CBRNE cooperation forum, which operates in the administrative branch of the Ministry of the Interior and whose work
is coordinated by the National Police Board, is to develop cooperation between the authorities in the efforts to prevent criminal CBRNE activities. In the preparation for chemical threats, it is essential to develop
and maintain an up-to-date situation picture and make it available to all parties responsible for the situation, especially in sudden and extensive chemical incidents. Furthermore, adequate expert and laboratory
resources must be safeguarded so that situations involving chemical threats can also be successfully dealt
with in the future. In June 2017, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment launched a regulatory
project in which the aim is to improve the preparedness of the chemicals and explosives industry for the
threat of terrorism and criminal activities.

##### Economy, infrastructure


### 25. [Acquiring economic resources and focusing them ]
**and safeguarding human resources**

**Ministry in charge: Ministry of Finance**

**Task and objective**

The availability of the economic resources required to ensure the functioning of the public sector will be
ensured. This includes debt servicing, cash management, payments, taxation (including Finnish Customs),
reallocation of economic resources, operating and financial planning and budget processes.

The availability of human resources in public administration will be ensured in all security situations.

**Operating model**

The preparedness of central government financial services, such as debt servicing and government transactions, as well as the systems critical to them are primarily developed in accordance with the requirements of cyber security. Procedures for guaranteeing tax payments and collection are also developed. It
may also be necessary to introduce drastically simplified tax collection methods during emergencies. The
task will be jointly implemented by all ministries, State Treasury, Finnish Government Shared Services
Centres for Finance and HR, Finnish Tax Administration and the Finnish Customs.

The human resources in public administration required for safeguarding the vital functions of society will,
if necessary, be ensured by applying the powers laid down in the Emergency Powers Act (1552/2011) or
using other emergency legislation. Emergency arrangements might include changes to regular working
hours and annual holidays, and the transfer of central government employees from one administrative
branch to another to perform tasks that require additional resources. The Ministry of Finance will cooperate with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment in issues concerning the regulations on personnel in contractual employment relationships.


-----

### 26. [Ensuring the functioning of the financial system ]

**Ministry in charge: Ministry of Finance**

**Task and objective**

The aim is to safeguard the stability of the financial markets and the continuation of the financial market
services essential to the functioning of society in all circumstances. Stable and uninterrupted operations
of the financial markets are critical to the functioning of society. Disruptions affecting financial markets
may endanger the availability of funding essential for the functioning of private and public organisations
and the funding required by private individuals. If out of control, crises affecting financial markets may develop into crises threatening the Finnish economy and cause companies and central government to lose
their creditworthiness. This might lead to serious disruptions to the functioning of society. Disruptions
affecting the financial market infrastructure and a situation where critical systems are blocked might endanger the continuation of the functions vital to society. Functioning of the economy and the infrastructure, ensuring minimum income to the population and the performing of the security tasks require access
to asset information and the permanence of the information as well as the ability to make, transmit and
receive payments.

**Operating model**

Financial markets are international and their functioning is based on the services and systems owned,
maintained and operated by financial sector companies. Central government guarantees their stability
through central banking operations, regulation and supervision as well as by providing a broad range of
different economic safety nets. Under the Finnish legislation, the companies providing important financial market services must have preparedness arrangements and this obligation also covers emergencies.
Most of the measures strengthening the stability and resilience of the markets as well as the security of
the services are based on regulatory reforms taken at global level and incorporated into the European
Union legislation.

Definition and implementation of the monetary policy are at the sole discretion of the EU. The Bank of
Finland takes part in the work of the European System of Central Banks and is one of the institutions implementing the joint monetary policy of the euro area laid out by the Governing Council of the European
Central Bank. Regulation of the financial markets is based on international cooperation. Finland is part of
the EU banking union in which the competence for supervising the solvency of the credit institutions and
the management of economic crises has been transferred to the single supervisory mechanism and the
single resolution mechanism of the EU. The Financial Supervisory Authority and the Financial Stability Authority are the Finnish institutions operation as part of these arrangements.

The focus in the measures taken by individual Member States is on preparing for threats to the financial
markets that do not involve economic disruptions. The authorities in the Member States also have prime
responsibility for operational measures during disruptions in cooperation with the companies providing


-----

financial market services. Disruptions affecting the infrastructure critical to the financial markets, which
may also occur locally, cannot be rectified by orders issued by the authorities or by applying emergency
powers. If necessary, the authorities must have access to sufficient, well-prepared and tested operating
models and backup systems. Safeguarding the vital functions of society in all circumstances and security
situations requires that the availability of critical financial market services is also ensured if the access to
the international services is prevented.

Financial market services are entirely dependent on the functioning of data communications links and
ICT systems as well as the systems supplying them with power. Safeguarding the continuation of the operations and the management of the disruptions requires close cooperation with ICT and cyber security
actors. The key authorities in this area are the Financial Supervisory Authority, the Bank of Finland, the
Financial Stability Authority, the European Central Bank and the EU Single Resolution Board. They cooperate with the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, Ministry of Transport and Communications, Finnish
Communications Regulatory Authority, the National Emergency Supply Agency/emergency supply organisation, National Land Survey of Finland as well as the companies producing financial market, data communications and ICT services.

### 27. [Safeguarding public administration ICT infrastructure ]
**and digital services**

**Ministries in charge:**
**Ministry of Finance, Prime Minister’s Office**

**Task and objective**

The Ministry of Finance is responsible for ensuring the steering of the data administration, ICT steering,
data and cyber security steering of the functions vital to society, and the shared public administration digital services and information required for the vital functions. At the targeted level, the public administration digital services and information essential for vital functions of society and the infrastructure required
by them are reliable and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information are secured. The
critical digital services and data of the state leadership and the security authorities are adequately secured and the services have been designed to function in all security situations so that the usability of the
data and the situation picture as well as the decision-making capacity can be guaranteed.

**Operating model**

ICT functions are used and digital services produced at national and international level. National and international cooperation is required to ensure their data and cyber security. The digital services produced
by public administration that are required for vital functions of society are based on agreements between
public administration and business operators. Development and production of the services have been extensively centralised over the past few years. Improving the capabilities of the actors producing shared
services is thus critical to the functioning of society.


-----

The Ministry of Finance is responsible for the overall steering of the data administration of the public administration authorities. This covers the steering of the overall architecture and compatibility of the public administration ICT infrastructure and digital services as well as the drafting of the general principles
for information security. Public administration ICT infrastructure and digital services are essential for providing the vital functions of society. Their security and continuity must be ensured so that they are available in all security situations. In order to ensure this, the Ministry of Finance has issued minimum security requirements for ICT infrastructure, digital services and data processing in public administration. Each
competent authority is responsible for their security and preparedness arrangements in its administrative
branch. The security and preparedness arrangements for the digital services and information used by the
state leadership and ministries is the responsibility of the Prime Minister’s Office. The responsibility of the
competent authority covers the tasks that it has assigned to others or that are carried out on its behalf.

The shared public administration ICT infrastructure and digital services comprise the joint central government data and communications technology services, the Government Security Network and its services,
as well as the shared public administration support services for electronic services. Their information and
communications technology preparedness, capability and security are steered by the Ministry of Finance.
If necessary, state leadership prioritises the use of the public administration ICT infrastructure and the
digital services permitted by it as well as the management of disruptions, especially during disruptions
occurring in normal conditions and during emergencies. The key authorities in this process are the Government ICT Centre Valtori, the Population Register Centre, in cooperation with the Prime Minister’s Office, Ministry of Transport and Communications, National Emergency Supply Agency/emergency supply
organisation, companies providing ICT services and the State Security Networks Group (including Suomen
Turvallisuusverkot Oy STUVE).


-----

### 28. [Ensuring availability of and access to electronic communications ]
**services**

**Ministry in charge: Ministry of Transport and Communications**

**Task and objective**

Access to high-quality, market-oriented, safe and reliable electronic communications services is ensured
during incidents and emergencies.

The availability of and access to the critical electronic communications services during incidents and emergencies is ensured on the basis of risk assessment, advance preparations and preparedness arrangements.
The following are considered critical communications services: emergency calls and mass communications
as well as services produced with communications services (such as payment transfer, electric networks,
transport control systems and social welfare and health care systems). Communications services are fault
tolerant and the functions for returning to the normal situation can be initiated immediately. Information
on incidents is provided without delay. Continuity of the functioning of the state leadership, internal and external security as well as the other critical electronic communications services is also ensured in the emergencies referred to in the Emergency Powers Act.

**Operating model**

The quality requirements for the functioning of the communications services are laid down in the Information Security Code. Telecommunications companies must ensure that they can continue their operations
with minimum interruptions during incidents occurring in normal conditions and in the emergencies referred to in the Emergency Powers Act.

In the safeguarding of the service levels of communications services and the preparedness arrangements concerning them, the focus is on cross-administrative cooperation, sharing of information and situation picture as
well as the coordination of preparedness in different administrative branches. Actors in administrative branches
promote the implementation and supervision of the data security and data protection provisions as well as the
guidance and advice provided for them. The Emergency Powers Act provides for additional powers and exceptional arrangements and the authorities have made preparations based on cross-administrative cooperation to
introduce them in emergencies. The preparedness of the authorities is maintained by conducting regular exercises. The purpose of the activities is also to make companies using communications services more aware of data
security issues and to promote exchange of information on data security threats.

International data security cooperation is important to Finland’s national data security work. International
cooperation, sharing of information and exercises make Finnish actors more aware of data security threats
and help them to prepare for the effects of the threats.

In addition to the administrative branch of the Ministry of Transport and Communications, the work also involves the Energy Authority, Department for Rescue Services of the Ministry of the Interior, the Emergency
Response Centre Administration, the emergency supply organisation, Ministry of Defence and the Finnish
Defence Forces. Business operators and the third sector also take part in the preparedness cooperation in
accordance with their roles.


-----

### 29. [Safeguarding the continuation of insurance business ]

**Ministry in charge: Ministry of Social Affairs and Health**

**Task and objective**

Insurance policies are part of companies’ risk management arrangements. Availability of insurance protection is a prerequisite for business operations and thus also for uninterrupted functioning of society. Insurance companies can only make investments and pay compensations if data communications and the
payment transaction services operated by the banks function properly. For example, compared with many
other Finnish operators, employment pension insurance companies have substantial investment assets,
which can only be managed if information systems function properly. Prolonged disruptions to data communications or payment systems have an immediate impact on the payment of insurance contributions
and compensations. If they persist, the disruptions have an impact on investments and thus also on the
solvency of the insurance companies.

Insurance operators manage the payments of a number of important income-related benefits and for this
reason ensuring the functioning of insurance operations is also important for ensuring the income security of the population. Earnings-related pensions are the main source of income for a large proportion of
the Finnish population. This means that employment pension security and accident insurance are an important part of the statutory social insurance. Citizens’ income security can only be ensured if particular
attention is paid to the functioning of the payment traffic and information systems during disruptions because the payment of social insurance benefits depends on these systems. Alternative arrangements must
be in place so that the data required for the payments can be supplied to the banks during disruptions
affecting data communications. Alternative payment methods should also be jointly reviewed by the authorities and the private sector.

The dialogue between society and the actors involved should be encouraged and the information on preparedness in the insurance sector should be made more easily accessible. ICT service companies operating in Finland and the actors operating in the sectors critical to the security of supply should have an extensive discussion on which services should be ensured during emergencies and on the prioritisation of
the services.

**Operating model**

The functioning of the payment traffic and data communications as well as the energy supply are critical
to the preparedness of the insurance sector. Functioning of the insurance operations can only be ensured
if there is close cooperation between the authorities and other actors. The Ministry of Social Affairs and
Health is responsible for ensuring the functioning of the insurance operations insofar as this concerns the
preparation of insurance legislation and the overall steering of the safeguarding of insurance operations.
Ensuring the functioning of the insurance operations is primarily the responsibility of the insurance companies and other insurance institutions. The Financial Supervisory Authority supervises compliance with
the preparedness requirements in insurance institutions.

### 30. [Securing the fuel supply]

**Ministries in charge: Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment,**
**Ministry of Transport and Communications, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry**

**Task and objective**

The purpose of the fuel supply is to maintain the availability of fuels and this is achieved by using a broad
range of different fuels and acquisition sources in energy production, by promoting the production and use of
domestic fuels as well as by emergency and obligatory stockpiling. Encouraging the use of renewable energy
sources, especially biofuels, increases the security of supply.

**Operating model**

Security of fuel supply is based on the obligatory stockpiling of imported fuels by companies. Moreover, for
disruptions of delivery and in order to meet international contractual obligations, the National Emergency Supply Agency maintains stockpiles of imported fuels so that Finland has, on average, reserves of imported fuels
for five months’ normal consumption. When determining the amounts to be stockpiled, oil products as an alternative to natural gas are only considered in the context of the energy supply of urban areas. The stockpiles
can only be effectively used if smoothly functioning delivery and transport logistics arrangements are in place.

District heating operators make preparations for power failures that may occur during serious incidents and emergencies and make arrangements for sufficient fuel reserves at their production plants. In order to ensure that peat
can be used in combined heat and power generation and to ensure that it is also available in adverse weather conditions, Finland should have peat stocks for about six months at the start of the peat production season. The growing
role of wood-based energy will be considered when preparations are made for the maintenance of the infrastructure, for ensuring adequate harvesting and transport equipment and for the availability of the workforce.

The safeguarding of the fuel supply is the responsibility of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment.
The administrative branch of the Ministry of Transport and Communications is responsible for the distribution
of transport fuels as part of the smooth functioning of transport systems as well as the movement of goods
and people. The authorities will ensure continuous availability of fuels for critical operators and the practical
measures for guaranteeing fuel supply will be planned in the companies operating in the sector. The National Emergency Supply Agency is responsible for the emergency stockpiling for the central government. Fuel
supply preparedness is steered by the Department of Energy Supply of the National Emergency Supply Agency and the practical implementation is the responsibility of the oil pool. Cooperating with the land and water
transport pools, the oil pool also maintains preparedness arrangements for the transport of oil products. The
pools work to strengthen the preparedness level of the companies operating in the sector. Company-specific
preparedness planning covers almost the entire oil and gas sector. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment is responsible for the directing of the overall rationing of liquid fuels and the rationing of heating oil.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications is responsible for ensuring uninterrupted transport operations,
while the safeguarding of the food supply is the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Under the Emergency Powers Act, the responsibility for the rationing of the oil products can be assigned to the oil
products distribution centre, which operates under the auspices of the Finnish Petroleum and Biofuels Association. The centre would guide and monitor the delivery of oil products, monitor the sales and stockpiling of
fuel oil, and assist oil companies in the implementation of the rationing so that the deliveries of oil products to
companies’ customers can be guaranteed. Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, which steers the Finnish Forest
Centre and Metsähallitus, is responsible for ensuring the supply of wood.

### 31. [Securing power supply]

**Task and objective**


**Ministry in charge:**
**Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment**


The ensuring of the power supply guarantees sufficient electricity and heat production as well as adequate transmission and distribution capacity. It also ensures that these systems function properly and
have adequate recovery capacity in both normal conditions and emergencies. Reliable power supply is a
basic requirement for the proper functioning of other vital areas of society. Serious disruptions in electricity or heat supply have an impact on all functions in society and may endanger critical functions and the
well-being of the population.

**Operating model**

Finland’s electricity transmission and distribution network is vulnerable because the production and use
of energy are decentralised over wide areas, electricity is transmitted over long distances in networks that
are physically unprotected and exposed to snow and storms. There is a strong mutual dependency between electricity distribution and communications networks.

Network companies enhance the reliability of their customers’ electricity supply by underground cabling
their medium voltage networks, by expanding network automation and by building more circular connections. Control systems of the electricity networks are highly automated and they may be targeted by
major cyber threats. Threats of overload are dealt with by circulating short power supply interruptions
between regions. Extensive disruptions in power supply may require the use of the powers provided for
in the Emergency Powers Act. In emergencies, there may be restrictions to the consumption of electricity or it may only be made available to uses essential for the security of supply. Rationing of electricity is
based on quotas.

The safeguarding of the power supply is the responsibility of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment. Security of the power supply is based on arrangements in effect during normal periods, which can
also be extensively applied during crises.

The preparedness measures taken by the public sector are of supplementary nature. The practical measures ensuring power supply are the responsibility of the companies in the sector. The functioning of the
power transmission system and the balance between peak demand and capacity are the responsibility of
Fingrid Oyj, the company managing Finland’s power transmission grid. Fingrid Oyj has extensive powers
to balance consumption and production already before Finland is in the emergency defined in the Emergency Powers Act. The preparedness of the electricity and heat generation and distribution companies
is steered by the Department of Energy Supply of the National Emergency Supply Agency and the power
and district heat pool coming under it. The functioning of the electricity markets and the operations of
the power transmission grid as part of them as well as the preparedness arrangements are supervised by
the Energy Authority.

### 32. [Ensuring weather, maritime and circumstance services]

**Ministry in charge:**
**Ministry of Transport and Communications**

**Task and objective**

The availability of the weather, maritime and circumstance services required for the safety and functioning of society will be ensured during incidents and emergencies.

The main purpose of the uninterrupted provision of weather, maritime and circumstance services is to
support the authorities, parties responsible for maintaining the critical infrastructure and other business
operators as they anticipate and prepare for disruptions, compile incident and situation pictures and manage incidents.

**Operating model**

The Finnish Meteorological Institute produces and develops weather, maritime and circumstance services
and in this work, it considers the needs of the citizens and the actors requiring the services. The Finnish
Meteorological Institute has statutory obligations concerning the production of weather, maritime and
circumstance information. The capacity of the Finnish Meteorological Institute to provide the services is
ensured through planning, advance preparations and preparedness. If necessary, the provision of the services can be continued with backup arrangements.

International cooperation is a prerequisite for the provision of weather, maritime and circumstance services in Finland. For this reason, the Finnish Meteorological Institute is an active participant in the international cooperation and exchange of information in its sector.

In addition to the actors in the administrative branch of the Ministry of Transport and Communications,
the cooperation also involves the Government Situation Centre, Finnish Defence Forces, Department for
Rescue Services of the Ministry of the Interior, regional rescue departments, Finnish Border Guard, Finnish Environment Institute and the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority.

### 33. [Ensuring the availability and usability of transport services]

**Ministry in charge:**
**Ministry of Transport and Communications**

**Task and objective**

The availability of high-quality, market-oriented, safe and reliable transport services is ensured during incidents and emergencies.

The availability of the transport services essential for the functioning of society is ensured during incidents and emergencies through risk assessments, advance preparations and preparedness arrangements.
These services include the transport services critical to the livelihood of the population, functioning of
the industries, commuting, transport of social welfare and health care clients, home to school transport
and the transport services provided by central and local government. Information on disruptions affecting
transport services is provided without delay.

**Operating model**

The preparedness obligation has been incorporated into the core legislation and it applies to rail transport operators, the operator of the underground railway in the Helsinki region as well as certain aviation
operators (including airlines and airport operators). Actors that do not have any statutory preparedness
obligations must ensure the continuity of their operations by other means. The core legislation and the
Emergency Powers Act supplement each other.

A cross-administrative approach is also applied in the division of labour between central government,
regional government and local government. The authorities use existing operating models and forums,
such as the emergency supply organisation, in the compilation of situation pictures for transport services,
sharing of information, exercises and in their other activities guaranteeing the level and availability of the
services.

Transport services are global, which means that in its preparedness, Finland must take into account the
European Union single market and the wider international operating environment.

In addition to the administrative branch of the Ministry of Transport and Communications, the Ministry
of Economic Affairs and Employment and the National Emergency Supply Agency coming within the ministry’s purview are responsible for the strengthening of the operating prerequisites and preparedness of
companies providing and using transport services. Fuel supply for transport operations critical to the functioning of society will be guaranteed. Business operators and the third sector also take part in the preparedness cooperation in accordance with their roles.

### 34. [Ensuring the security and operational reliability of transport and ]
**communications network**

**Ministry in charge:**
**Ministry of Transport and Communications**

**Task and objective**

The security and operational reliability of the transport and communications networks essential for uninterrupted functioning of society are ensured during incidents and emergencies.

The security and functioning of the transport and communications networks are ensured during incidents
and emergencies in accordance with the service level requirements set for them by central and local government. Critical transport and communications networks comprise the domestic and foreign data communications links, mobile communications networks and the key transport hubs, such as ports, terminals
and airports as well as critical transport routes. The threats and incidents affecting the security and functioning of the networks are identified and preparations for them are made on the basis of planning and
advance preparations based on risk assessment. The reactions to any disruptions are on a flexible basis,
backup systems are used and the aim is to restore the normal operations of the networks without any
undue delay. During emergencies, the security and availability of the networks will remain at a level that
will meet the basic requirements of society, business operators, the authorities and citizens in the area of
mobility and communications.

**Operating model**

There are provisions in the legislation on the operational quality requirements and preparedness obligations for transport and communications networks. Knowledge intensive nature of society and interdependence of the systems is mainly reflected in the higher interdependency of transport, data communications
and energy systems, making cross-administrative cooperation necessary. This interdependency will grow
as there is a move to digital transport services and autonomous vehicles.

During emergencies, the authorities responsible for the transport and communications networks will cooperate with other authorities on a cross-administrative basis and make preparations for the introduction
of the additional powers and emergency arrangements laid down in the Emergency Powers Act.

Finland will actively participate in the development of the security regulation for transport and communications networks in the European Union and in other international forums.

In addition to the administrative branch of the Ministry of Transport and Communications, the Ministry
of Economic Affairs and Employment and the Energy Authority and the National Emergency Supply Agency, two agencies coming within the ministry’s purview, encourage the voluntary preparedness of a broad
range of different actors. The Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior ensure the integrity of
the physical infrastructure of the transport and communications networks as necessary. Finavia Corporation is responsible for the safety and operational reliability of the key Finnish airports. Business operators
and the third sector also take part in the preparedness cooperation in accordance with their roles.

### 35. [Ensuring the continuity of the transports essential for Finland’s ]
**security of supply and foreign trade**

**Ministries in charge:**
**Ministry of Transport and Communications, Ministry of Defence,**
**Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment**

**Task and objective**

The functioning and safety of the transport logistics system and the domestic and foreign trade transport
operations critical to the functioning of society and security of supply (including the required support services) is ensured during incidents and emergencies.

The land, air and maritime transport links of Finland’s foreign trade, land border crossings, terminals,
ports, airports and country-internal transport operations critical to the livelihood of the population, working life and industries are ensured during incidents and emergencies. The continuous existence of the
merchant fleet of Finnish shipping companies is ensured. The State of Finland is able to provide guarantees if commercial insurance is no longer available.

**Operating model**

Critical companies and service providers ensure the continuity of their operations through legislative
means, on a contractual basis or by other binding arrangements. Cooperating on a cross-administrative
basis, the authorities make preparations to introduce the additional powers and emergency arrangements laid down in the Emergency Powers Act. The additional powers may involve the securing of the
power supply for transport operations critical to the functioning of society and security of supply, arrangements concerning the maintenance, servicing and reserve parts supply of the transport stock, and the allocation of vehicles and mobile machinery.

Finland will play an active role in the issues concerning the security of supply and transport logistics in the
European Union, in its Nato cooperation and in other international forums. Finland’s transport logistics
system will also support the objectives of Finland’s international defence cooperation, such as the partnership cooperation between Finland and Nato and the host nation support concept.

In addition to the administrative branch of the Ministry of Transport and Communications, the Ministry
of Economic Affairs and Employment and the National Emergency Supply Agency, which comes within
the ministry’s purview, also strengthen the operating prerequisites of the companies providing and using
transport and logistics services. The Ministry of the Interior is responsible for organising the rescue services required for maintaining the operational reliability of the transport system. As part of the Finnish
Defence Forces, the Finnish Navy is responsible for the operations ensuring the protection of maritime
transport. The Finnish Customs enforces the necessary regulation of foreign trade and plays its part in the
efforts to ensure an uninterrupted transport chain. Business operators and the third sector also take part
in the preparedness cooperation in accordance with their roles.


-----

### 36. [Ensuring the functioning of the social welfare and health care ]
**information systems and the availability of critical supplies**

**Ministries in charge:**
**Ministry of Social Affairs and Health,**
**Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment**

**Task and objective**

The availability of pharmaceuticals and vaccines is ensured through obligatory stockpiling. The preparedness arrangements are supplemented with other types of decentralised emergency stockpiling of crisis-specific products that are needed in small amounts. The availability of materials and reserve parts for medical
equipment and supplies is also ensured. The cooperation between national and international health care
preparedness experts and authorities and the National Emergency Supply Agency is ensured. The aim is
to achieve uniform minimum level of material preparedness nationwide. In order to guarantee access to
pharmaceuticals, vaccines and medical equipment and supplies, bilateral and multilateral security of supply agreements between countries are developed. Finland is actively promoting the security of health care
supply dimension in the EU. Regional joint purchasing procedures for pharmaceuticals and medical equipment and supplies are developed.

Obligatory and emergency stockpiles of pharmaceuticals as well as emergency stockpiles of medical equipment and supplies are maintained in order to ensure the continuity of operations. Pharmaceuticals and
protective material are purchased for widespread epidemics of contagious diseases. The supply of vaccines
is ensured through agreements and the availability of the equipment used in their dosing is secured by
maintaining emergency stockpiles.

Digitalised functions and services are becoming more common in social welfare and health care. Their operational reliability must also be ensured during incidents and emergencies using backup arrangements based on
risk assessments. The required client and patient information must be available in all situations, which means
that the documents must be kept in Finland. Proper functioning of the register of social welfare and health
care professionals and the national social welfare and health care data resources are an important part of ensuring the operational reliability of social welfare and health care during crises. Transfer of diagnostic and other client and patient data, digital services and the cyber security of networked social welfare and health care
equipment must be ensured. As more and more social welfare and health services are provided as home care,
the threats to the sector are also spreading outside hospitals and health centres, which must be taken into account in the contingency and preparedness plans of the service providers.

**Operating model**

The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health develops guidelines and training for social welfare and health care
preparedness. Cooperation in contingency planning and preparedness between Nordic countries will be increased. The responsibility for the updating of the social welfare and health care preparedness plans lies with
the units providing the services. The preparedness is supported through obligatory stockpiling and emergency
stockpiles maintained by the state. Obligatory and emergency stockpiles will be decentralised. In the purchases of medical equipment and supplies, reliance on a single supplier should be avoided. The stockpiled items
will be scored in accordance with the importance, strategic role, crisis sensitivity and crisis specificity of each
item. Preparedness for cyber incidents will be strengthened at all levels of public administration.

### 37. [Detection and monitoring of changes taking place in the environment, ]
**adapting to the changes and combating the threats arising from them**

**Ministries in charge:**
**Ministry of the Environment,**
**Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry**

**Task and objective**

Finland will maintain preparedness to detect, monitor and anticipate changes in the environment as well as
society’s preparedness to adapt to them and combat the threats arising from the changes. As part of this
work, Finland contributes to the drafting and implementation of international environmental agreements.

At national level, environmental threats may cause significant property and environmental damage as
well as negatively affect the prerequisites for business activities. Effective monitoring systems allow detrimental changes in the environment to be detected and anticipated so that their impacts can be contained
and the damage caused by them can be repaired as quickly as possible.

The state of the environment is continuously monitored and the relevant data registers updated. The
monitoring capacity also provides a basis for detecting and managing environmental accidents. Impacts
of environmental accidents on the environment can be quickly modelled using the monitoring information. Finland will continue to participate in international cooperation aimed at slowing down the climate
change. International cooperation aimed at improving the state of the Baltic Sea and at bringing the other
detrimental environmental changes taking place under control will also continue.

**Operating model**

The task of the Ministry of the Interior is to steer and develop the overall monitoring of the environment
and to steer overall preparedness for environmental changes in cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.

Central government authorities monitor the state of the environment in the areas coming under them. It
is important to ensure in the regional government reform that the monitoring of waters, air, soil and biota
is organised and performed on a regional basis. Municipalities are responsible for monitoring the state of
the environment in their areas. It is important to ensure in the regional government reform that the tasks
now performed by the ELY Centres will also be managed after the reorganisation.

The Finnish Environment Institute and the Natural Resources Institute Finland monitor and assess the
state of the environment and environmental pollution, study changes taking place in the environment
and their causes and develop ways to prevent detrimental changes in the environment. The two agencies
produce information on the slowing down of the climate change and adjustment to the phenomenon in
cooperation with the Finnish Meteorological Institute. The Finnish Environment Institute and the Natural
Resources Institute Finland maintain systems for monitoring the environment and for producing information on it. The two agencies take part in international cooperation in their capacity as experts. The Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority is responsible for monitoring the levels of radiation in the environment.


-----

### 38. [Ensuring waste management]

**Ministry in charge: Ministry of the Environment**

**Task and objective**

The aim is to ensure the operational reliability of the waste management, keep interruptions to a minimum during incidents and to promote and maintain preparedness in the sector. Furthermore, in cooperation with the emergency supply organisation, every effort is made to maintain the capability to meet
the deficit in fuels and raw materials resulting from a closure of the borders caused by external factors by
channelling waste flows to these purposes.

The aim is to ensure that the collection, transport and treatment of the unexpected and exceptional
amounts of waste arising from oil spills, nuclear accidents, animal disease epidemics, floods and other
similar unforeseen and unusual events can be organised in a controlled and systematic manner. An adequate level of preparedness is ensured by selecting waste sites in advance as part of the land use planning
process and by maintaining the capacity to provide alternative waste collection, transport and treatment
capacity through preparedness and other arrangements. The authorities and companies cooperate on an
efficient and anticipatory basis. In order to meet energy and raw material needs, a large proportion of the
recycling and recovery capacity can be directed to heating and electricity generation, transport fuel supply and the production of fertilisers.

**Operating model**

The Ministry of the Environment is responsible for the overall steering, monitoring and development
of waste management. The Ministry of the Environment supports the participation of its administrative
branch in the work of the emergency supply organisation. The aim of the waste sector emergency supply committee is to ensure the security of supply in the waste sector during disruptions of varying severity occurring in normal conditions. The Ministry of the Environment, National Emergency Supply Agency,
Finnish Environment Institute, Finnish Food Safety Authority, ELY Centres as well as municipal and private
waste management companies are represented in the committee.

ELY Centres steer and promote the carrying out of waste management tasks in the areas coming under
them and, in cooperation with the municipal environmental protection authorities, supervise compliance with the Waste Act and the provisions and regulations issued under it. Regional State Administrative
Agencies and the municipal environmental protection authorities act as the competent environmental
permit authorities. The National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health is responsible for steering
the prevention of the health hazards arising from waste in its area of responsibility. Municipalities are responsible for the organisation of the management of municipal waste and land use planning in their areas. Organisation of waste management during incidents and the safeguarding of waste-based fuel and
raw material production requires cooperation between the authorities responsible for food, radiation and
nuclear safety as well as transport and health care authorities, rescue services, municipalities and waste
management companies.

### 39. [Securing resources for construction]

**Ministry in charge:  Ministry of the Environment**

**Task and objective**

Securing resources for construction means the regulation of the construction sector and the rationing
of construction products in accordance with the powers provided for in the Emergency Powers Act. The
aim is to channel construction resources to essential construction in emergencies defined in the Emergency Powers Act and during disruptions occurring in normal conditions. Projects of the Finnish Defence
Forces, construction work essential for the protection, supply and safety of the population, safeguarding
of the transport and communications links, construction projects essential for the energy supply and the
construction work essential for the maintenance of the water supply network and sewers are considered
essential construction. Completion of unfinished projects and urgent repairs may also be considered essential in certain cases.

All construction projects in progress are suspended after the regulation and rationing have been introduced. Projects under way may be continued if an appropriate permit is issued. New projects must receive a start permit. When permits are issued, priority is given to essential construction projects. In an
emergency, a construction production advisory board will be established under the Ministry of the Environment, in which the construction industry, developers and the public sector are represented. The task
of the advisory board is to monitor the developments concerning the need for new construction and production factors. The advisory board will, as necessary, submit a proposal to the Ministry of the Environment on the introduction of the regulatory powers and on revoking them when they are no longer needed. During regulated construction, the permits for new projects and the continuation of projects under
way are issued by the municipal construction supervisory authorities. However, the permits for construction projects requiring regionally important resources are issued by an ELY Centre and for projects with
national importance by the Ministry of the Environment. Regionally and nationally important projects are
defined in a government decree.

Under the rationing of construction products, a trader may only sell or otherwise deliver construction
products to customers with a purchase permit. The purchase permit is not required when construction
products are sold or delivered to wholesale or retail operators, for projects of the Finnish Defence Forces
or for purchasing construction products from other countries. During the rationing of construction products, purchasing permits for construction products are issued by the building supervisory authority of the
municipality in the area in which the project is mostly carried out.


-----

**Operating model**

As the threshold for applying the Emergency Powers Act is high, resources arising from disruptions occurring in normal conditions and resources required for construction projects of the Finnish Defence Forces
will be secured through civil law letters of intent and preparedness agreements between the Finnish Defence Forces and construction companies. Companies (building contractors) vital to the security of supply
may conclude letters of intent to reserve machinery and personnel for agreed construction work. Under
a letter of intent, a company undertakes to maintain preparedness for the carrying out of a specific construction project within a specific period after it has received the request for assistance. The material content and timetable of the work to be carried out are laid out in the letter of intent. The letter of intent is a
binding agreement that will only be implemented if the Finnish Defence Forces issues an implementation
notification. Under the preparedness agreement, the contractor undertakes to maintain preparedness so
that it can perform the construction work specified in the letter of intent. The preparedness agreement
lays out the preparedness period concerning the start of the work. The construction pool serves as a cooperation body for construction companies and a forum in which the construction companies, the Finnish Defence Forces and other authorities discuss matters concerning construction activities during disruptions in normal conditions and emergencies.


-----

### 40. [Ensuring proper housing]

**Task and objective**


**Ministry in charge: Ministry of the Environment**


The housing needs of the population will be ensured in situations where sections of the population must
be evacuated or large numbers of people move between locations at their own initiative. In order to meet
the housing needs of the population in such situations, regulatory measures can be introduced in specific emergencies laid down in the Emergency Powers Act so that the housing stock can be used more efficiently. Legislative and administrative preparedness to resettle large numbers of people in an emergency
will be maintained.

The use of the housing stock can be regulated during an armed attack or a threat of it and in an emergency caused by a disaster.

There are three levels in the regulation of the use of the housing stock: 1) notifying regulatory authorities
of housing offered for rent; 2) notifying regulatory authorities of available housing and housing becoming available and other premises suitable for housing for rent; and 3) notifying the authorities of vacant
rooms. The maximum rent increases can also be regulated by decree.

**Operating model**

Housing arrangements are primarily the responsibility of the residents and the authorities will only intervene when necessary. A municipality will assign one of its bodies to perform housing regulatory tasks or
establish a housing stock regulatory authority for the purpose. In addition to the municipalities, the Housing Finance and Development Centre of Finland (ARA), ELY Centres and the Ministry of the Environment
are also key actors in the process. The regional government reform must also include reorganisation of
the tasks of the ELY Centres.

Housing market actors and organisations representing them can produce information on housing markets
and provide assistance in the organisation of the activities.

### 41. [Safeguarding the water supply]

**Ministries in charge:**
**Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Ministry of Social Affairs and Health,**
**Ministry of the Environment**

**Task and objective**

The purpose of the safeguarding of the water supply is to ensure access to clean water and wastewater
management that is appropriate in terms of health and environmental protection. The measures to ensure the water supply cover the entire water supply chain, from water sources to the discharge points of
treated wastewater.

**Operating model**

The securing of water supply is the responsibility of municipalities, the local water utilities, property owners or occupants of properties. Overall steering and monitoring of the water supply is the responsibility of
the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, supported by the National Institute for Health and Welfare and the National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health in
their capacity as expert bodies, is responsible for ensuring the quality of drinking water, while water protection and the steering of wastewater treatment are the responsibility of the Ministry of the Environment. Preparations will be made to secure the supply of water during emergencies under the Emergency
Powers Act.

### 42. [Flood risk management and supervision of dam safety ]

**Ministry in charge: Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry**

**Task and objective**

The purpose of flood risk management and supervision of dam safety is to prepare for sudden events and
accidents as well as for gradually evolving phenomena such as climate change. The aim in flood risk management is to reduce floods, prevent and minimise the losses arising from floods and promote preparedness. The aim in the supervision of dam safety is to ensure safety at all stages of the dam’s life-cycle and
to reduce the hazard arising from the dam.

**Operating model**

Dam owners are responsible for the condition and safety of their dams and they must draw up dam break
hazard analyses for class 1 dams and other dams specified by the authorities. The Flood Centre produces
national flood forecasts and flood warnings and maintains a national water and flood situation picture.
The Flood Centre is a joint service provided by the Finnish Meteorological Institute and the Finnish Environment Institute, which is based on close cooperation with ELY Centres (in the future with regions) and
regional rescue departments. Information and services are provided for the authorities, citizens as well as
companies and other business operators.


-----

### 43. [Securing sufficient labour workforce ]

**Ministry in charge:**
**Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment**

**Task and objective**

Preparations are made to channel the flow of labour workforce and, if necessary, to acquire supplementary labour workforce. At the same time, preparations are made to ensure adequate supply of competent
workforce to companies vital to the functioning of society, public administration, national defence and to
sectors connected with basic income security. Securing the supply of adequate labour workforce supports
the security of supply.

**Operating model**

Today’s societies are increasingly based on electronic operating environments. As a result, expertise and
specialised knowledge are becoming increasingly important, particularly during incidents and emergencies. Regulating the use of labour workforce by means of normal employment services should also have
priority during emergencies. In situations classified as the most serious emergency conditions in the
Emergency Powers Act (war or the threat of war), the authorities can be provided with special powers under which they can introduce compulsory employment services and a general obligation to work and limit
the right to lay off employees.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment coordinates cooperation between the authorities in
the acquisition of the labour workforce and its steering so that the continuity of the vital functions of society can be ensured. In central government, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health is one of the key partners to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment in the processing of the information on health
care personnel. Other partners include the Population Register Centre, Statistics Finland, local register offices and key organisations of business operators and entrepreneurs. At regional and local level, the responsibility lies with the ELY Centres and the Employment and Economic Development Offices.

In order to ensure adequate supply of labour workforce, it is essential that all administrative branches,
functions and services vital to society and businesses critical to the security of supply will in their own preparedness plans address the need for key personnel and their general requirement for labour and training
during incidents and emergencies.


-----

### 44. [Maintaining the education, training and research system ]

**Ministry in charge: Ministry of Education and Culture**

**Task and objective**

The availability of broad-based expertise and skills and sufficiently professional labour workforce in accordance with supply and demand can be ensured by continuing education and research activities during
incidents. The national research system produces information for public decision-making. The role of national research activities is highlighted during emergencies when it is difficult to get access to information
produced elsewhere.

**Operating model**

Proper functioning of the education, training and research system is ensured. Resources are allocated to
different educational levels and sectors in a manner required by the security situation and in accordance
with the supply of and demand for labour workforce. The option of moving from one level of education
to the next is guaranteed. Every effort is made to arrange matriculation examinations, joint applications
and entry exams, to provide early childhood education and school meals and to ensure the welfare of students in all security situations.

Continuation of the research activities performed in state-owned research institutions and higher education institutions is ensured. Continuation of basic research is guaranteed to the extent necessary because
applied research and research that supports decision-making is built on comprehensive basic research.
Sufficient access to information is guaranteed by focusing research funding and applying performance
management to research institutions, universities and universities of applied sciences. Changes in information needs are considered and anticipated in the joint government research funding processes. Consideration is also given to the development, maintenance and availability of the research infrastructure,
such as equipment, software and research instruments, and to the changes required in the infrastructure
in emergencies. Individual ministries are responsible for the steering of the research institutions in their
own administrative branches as well as for changes in research and for reallocation of research funding
during incidents and emergencies.


-----

### 45. [Safeguarding vital industries and services ]

**Ministry in charge:**
**Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment**

**Task and objective**

The task of the critical industries and services is to produce goods and services for ensuring the vital
functions of society. The focus is on the following: production critical to the security of supply, operating
prerequisites of the export industries, capability to maintain and repair defence materiel and systems,
emergency stockpiling of the critical raw materials, components and other production inputs, ensuring
a smooth partnership between private and public sector as well as international economic cooperation.

**Operating model**

Preparedness arrangements are based on legislation, agreements and independent operations of companies. Central government authorities, unincorporated state enterprises and municipalities have a statutory obligation to ensure that they can perform their tasks with minimum interruptions during disruptions
occurring in normal conditions and in emergencies. Industrial companies are not bound by a similar statutory obligation. In their case, the preparedness is based on the agreements between sectoral organisations and the National Emergency Supply Agency. One exception to this rule is the Act on the Emergency Stockpiling of Pharmaceuticals (979/2008) under which pharmaceutical manufacturers, importers of
pharmaceutical products, health care operating units and the National Institute for Health and Welfare
must stockpile pharmaceutical substances and products as well as excipients and additives used in the
production of pharmaceuticals, and packaging materials. It is in the interest of society to safeguard the
uninterrupted operations of all companies and networks important to the security of supply. Interdependencies are highlighted in a networked society. Development of companies’ continuity management accounts for a large proportion of the security of supply work carried out as part of critical production. Finland maintains emergency and security stockpiles of a number of important raw materials and products.
It is important to ensure closer contacts between key actors and to compile and maintain a centralised
situation picture.

Many of the measures aimed at adapting to shrinking resources can be carried out on a market-oriented basis within the framework of the emergency supply organisation, so that sectoral actors, experts and
the authorities work together to find the optimum solution. In difficult and prolonged situations, imports
and exports of raw materials and their use in industries would be steered in accordance with the Emergency Powers Act.

Steering and coordination of the preparedness arrangements in critical production are the responsibility
of ministries, the National Emergency Supply Agency and the industrial sector and pools of the emergency supply organisation. The pools steer and support preparedness of the companies and operational sites
of their own sectors, promote cooperation between companies and the authorities, prepare and maintain
information on critical companies in their sectors and arrange preparedness exercises and training. The
necessary regulation of the export and import of goods is implemented by the Finnish Customs in cooperation with other relevant authorities and companies.

### 46. [Safeguarding food supply]

**Ministries in charge:**
**Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Ministry of Economic Affairs**
**and Employment, Ministry of Transport and Communications,**
**Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, Ministry for Foreign Affairs**

**Task and objective**

The purpose of the safeguarding of the food supply is to ensure the availability, quality and safety of the
food products purchased by the population. This is achieved through adequate domestic agricultural production, emergency stockpiling, by shifting the focus in the production system to renewable and recyclable production inputs and by ensuring the availability of the foreign inputs required in the production. The
operating prerequisites of the fisheries sector are safeguarded by ensuring that fish resources are used
and managed in a sustainable manner.

**Operating model**

Constant efforts are made at national level and in the EU so that adequate economic prerequisites for agriculture can be maintained in all parts of Finland (including the northernmost areas). Economically sustainable primary production is a basic prerequisite for safeguarding food supply. The supply of raw materials and the ability of the companies responsible for the production and distribution of food products to
deliver the products to consumers can be ensured by improving the operational reliability and continuity
management of the primary production. The functioning of the order-delivery chain in digital and physical
environments (including foreign trade) is ensured in cooperation with business operators.

The agricultural operators produce the raw materials for the food industry, which must have enterprise
resource planning systems based on real-time information on the raw materials supplied by agricultural
producers. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry makes preparations for directing production and for
regulating the supply of such items as fuels, fertilisers, seeds, feed and the veterinary drugs essential for
combating animal diseases and zoonoses, in cooperation with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment, Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, emergency supply organisation and the Finnish Medicines
Agency so that the entire population can be provided with nutrition that is adequate, safe and of sufficient quality in all security situations. The flow of information and cooperation between the authorities,
organisations and business operators in the development of competence and the compilation of the situation picture play a central role.

Ensuring the operating prerequisites of primary production and the safeguarding of food safety are the
responsibility of the administrative branch of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Safeguarding the
processing and distribution of foodstuffs and securing other areas of the supply of daily consumer goods
are the responsibility of the administrative branch of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment.
Ensuring the continuity of transport operations and cyber security are the responsibility of the administrative branch of the Ministry of Transport and Communications, while the ensuring of the prerequisites
for foreign trade is the responsibility of the administrative branch of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Safeguarding the availability of veterinary drugs and vaccines falls within the purview of the Ministry of Social
Affairs and Health. The task of the food control of the Finnish Customs is to control food imports and to
promote the smoothness of the transport operations.

### 47. [Ensuring the supply of daily consumer goods ]

**Ministries in charge:**
**Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment,**
**Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry**

**Task and objective**

The purpose of the supply of daily consumer goods is to ensure the availability of the foodstuffs important
to the well-being of the population and the availability of a number of other basic items such as toiletry
and the prerequisites for mass catering.

**Operating model**

The system of the supply of daily consumer goods is based on smoothly functioning markets, a domestic food industry and its processing capacity as well as on the operating capacity of the food logistics and
retail trade. The functioning of the markets, logistics, payment systems, information systems and data
connections, as well as the electricity supply and the emergency stockpiling of cereals play a central role.

It is essential that in all security situations the authorities and business operators produce a centralised
situation picture and that they work in close cooperation in all other areas. Central government actors
also cooperate with the authorities in other countries. Markets will adapt and find new ways of operating. Finland can adapt to shrinking resources by focusing on the production of the most important basic
products, by steering the use of the food industry raw materials and by ensuring coordinated steering of
the distribution of the products. The concept behind the organisation of the strategic level of disruption
management in the supply of daily consumer goods should be clarified.

Cooperating with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment makes preparations for directing the use of resources as well as the production and supply of foodstuffs in a manner that is in accordance with the emergency supply requirements for serious incidents and
emergencies. If necessary, this is made using the powers provided for in the Emergency Powers Act. Municipalities must safeguard the continuity of the meal services coming under their responsibility during
serious incidents and emergencies. In the future, this obligation will also apply to regions.

##### Functional capacity of the

### 48. [Ensuring the last-resort livelihood of the population]

**Ministries in charge:**
**Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, Ministry of Finance**

**Task and objective**

Adequate income security helps to prevent poverty and social exclusion and strengthen well-being, resilience, social stability and national unity. People entitled to minimum benefits are in an extremely vulnerable position and individuals relying for them for their income may face economic problems even during
short disruptions to the payment of benefits.

Funding and payment of the benefits during crises is safeguarded by maintaining plans for legislative
changes and by ensuring a nationally comprehensive service network and service channels adapted to
crisis situations. Preparedness is based on cooperation between local level authorities coordinated in advance, which is supported by central government actors in their own areas of responsibility.

The aim is to minimise interruptions to normal life during incidents and emergencies. The payment of all
benefits will continue as normal as long as the services, payment systems and funding arrangements remain
operational. If benefit payments must be restricted, the cuts will primarily be done to benefits that do not
substantially impact the immediate livelihood of the recipients. A single benefit for different life situations
paid on a continuous basis is planned for severe crises. The benefit would be paid as social assistance.

The Social Insurance Institution of Finland is responsible for the processing and payment of basic social
assistance, which is provided as the last-resort benefit. The granting of the supplementary and preventive social assistance paid on a discretionary basis is now the responsibility of the municipal social services but the responsibility will be transferred to regions as part of the regional government reform. The
Social Insurance Institution of Finland and the municipalities will also make preparations for arranging income security during emergencies. Backup procedures must be established so that social assistance can
also be paid during disruptions affecting information systems and extensive disruptions affecting banking
and payment systems. An operating model for ensuring minimum income of the population during extensive incidents will be jointly drawn up by the authorities. It is also important to have a comprehensive nationwide network of service points operated by the Social Insurance Institution of Finland and the municipalities and to ensure that effective service channels are available. Supplementary and preventive social
assistance will be introduced in a flexible and proactive manner as part of social work. If necessary, the
process will be jointly carried out by the municipalities (in the future by regions) in cooperation with the
Social Insurance Institution of Finland. As there may only be a limited number of properly functioning service channels during a crisis, it is important that these channels are accessible to all actors responsible for
managing the provision of basic income security. Emergency procedures can be used in a flexible manner
in the cooperation between the authorities.


-----

**Operating model**

The Social Insurance Institution of Finland will make preparations for uninterrupted payments of social
assistance. Cooperation, especially the electronic data transfer (including the backup systems), between
the Social Insurance Institution of Finland and the municipalities will be ensured. It is important that the
same information on the social assistance clients is available to municipalities and the Social Insurance
Institution of Finland crisis situations and emergencies. Municipalities will also make preparations for
paying supplementary and preventive social assistance during crises, incidents and emergencies. In the
future, these preparedness arrangements will be the responsibility of the regions. The Social Insurance Institution of Finland, the Finnish Centre for Pensions, banks, tax authorities, the Population Register Centre
and operators have agreed on the basic principles on the arrangements ensuring the functioning of backup systems. During emergencies, changes to the level and payment of benefits can be made by government decree. During emergencies, the aim is to ensure that the return to normality can be achieved with
minimum disruption. Benefits paid during emergencies are not collected and no adjustments to them are
made as the normal procedures are reintroduced.


-----

### 49. [Ensuring access to social welfare and health care services]

**Ministry in charge: Ministry of Social Affairs and Health**

**Task and objective**

The functional capacity and well-being of the population is ensured by maintaining and developing social
welfare and health care services in normal conditions and by preparing for crises, incidents and emergencies. The organisation of public services will remain the responsibility of municipalities and joint municipal
federations until the end of 2019, after which the responsibility will be transferred to 18 regions. As part
of these arrangements, the organisation and provision of the social welfare and health care services will
be made into two separate entities. However, unincorporated social welfare and health care enterprises
of the regions will have ultimate responsibility for the provision of the services. The national permit and
supervisory authority will also be responsible for supervising compliance with the basic rights and other legal provisions as part of the preparedness arrangements. However, the operational units have prime
responsibility for ensuring client and patient safety during crises and emergencies. Self-monitoring also
applies to contingency and preparedness functions, such as the contingency plans and updates to them.
Regions must ensure that the preparedness arrangements in social welfare and health care services are
made into functioning entities in cooperation with other regions, municipalities, the third sector and central government actors. Functioning of the critical infrastructure (electricity, water supply, waste management, food supply and client and patient information systems) is key to ensuring access to social welfare
and health care services. Ensuring the functioning of the national blood service is also part of the process
of safeguarding the reliability of Finland’s health care and it will be coordinated with the other preparedness arrangements made for the service system. The Finnish Medicines Agency is responsible for steering and supervising the quality and safety of the blood service. Smoothly functioning basic services and
well-planned client and patient processes as well as the division of responsibilities are part of high-quality preparedness arrangements. The need for urgent services and the role of crisis work are highlighted
during incidents.

Five cooperation areas, each of which has an emergency care centre, will be established for the regional coordination, development and cooperation of the social welfare and health care organised by the regions. The emergency care services will be part of the social welfare and health care emergency duties
as well as the preparedness arrangements for the sector. The emergency care centres and region-level
emergency social services will draw up their own regional contingency and preparedness plans as well as
a situation picture, which will be coordinated with the plans and situation pictures prepared by other authorities and actors. Furthermore, the emergency care centres will coordinate the alarm instructions for
emergency response centres and they are also responsible for maintaining national high-level preparedness communications and information systems for regional social welfare and health care. Twelve of the
regions will be responsible for the extensive 24-hour emergency care provided as part of the social welfare and health care services.


-----

**Operating model**

Municipalities (in the future regions) must ensure that people receive the urgent social welfare and health
care services essential for their functional capacity and well-being in all security situations, irrespective of
their place of residence and the time of the day, considering the capacity of the private service providers.
Organisers and providers of social welfare and health care services prepare for incidents and emergencies
by drawing up contingency plans in cooperation with the authorities, companies, organisations and citizens. In the preparedness arrangements, consideration must be given to the fact that an increasing proportion of the social welfare and health care services are provided at home. In the safeguarding of the
essential social welfare and health care services, special consideration is given to vulnerable groups. The
purpose of environmental health care is to prevent, as part of basic health care, health hazards occurring
in the living environment.

The following national actors designated by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health will operate in the
Uusimaa -region: the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa and the Poison Information Centre (for
medical care) and the Vantaa Social Emergency and Crisis Center (for psychosocial assistance). As a national actor, Northern Ostrobothnia will be responsible for developing and maintaining the digital contingency planning tool for social welfare and health care. The Social Insurance Institution of Finland will
maintain national social welfare and health care data resources, which will become important during crises if local data systems become unavailable.

During the interim regional government, consideration will be given to the preparedness of the future
structures for incidents and emergencies. Municipalities (in the future regions) must also ensure the continuity of the services when they are purchased from private providers or with service vouchers. This is
done through agreements, joint training, exercises and preparedness planning. Each organisation will be
responsible for ensuring that its personnel know how to act during incidents and emergencies.

Preparedness in social welfare and health care services is developed in the field of legislation, guidance,
training, exercises and monitoring. Alarm and situation picture arrangements as well as communications
for disruptions will be developed. Consideration is given to the voluntary resources of organisations at all
levels of administration, and plans and arrangements are made for the support required during incidents
and emergencies.


-----

### 50. [Maintaining expertise and skills]

**Ministry in charge: Ministry of Education and Culture**

**Task and objective**

Uninterrupted provision of the most important educational and training services is ensured in all situations. Education, training and maintenance of expertise and skills enhance the psychological, physical and
social well-being of the population by enhancing the capacity of individuals to deal with incidents and
emergencies. Educational and training services are used as a channel for public information and active
citizenship as well as an activity that helps to maintain the nation’s psychological and social cohesion and
enhances people’s trust in society as well as a function strengthening citizens’ will to defend Finland. The
task of maintaining expertise and skills contributes to the functional capacity of the population, services
and resilience as part of the maintenance of vital functions of society.

**Operating model**

Continuation of early childhood education and basic education services is ensured during incidents and
emergencies. Preparations will be made for situations where the need for the services may increase.
Participation and active citizenship are incorporated into the curricula of the early childhood education,
pre-primary education, basic education and upper secondary education in an all-encompassing manner.
Children, young people and adults are provided with information on Finnish values, safety of the population and society as well as information about responsible behaviour in different life situations.


-----

##### Psychological resilience

### 51. [Maintaining cultural services and protecting cultural heritage]

**Ministry in charge: Ministry of Education and Culture**

**Task and objective**

Culture is a key element in shaping our identity and self-esteem. A strong sense of identity fosters inclusion and ability to commit to common goals. In an international operating environment and in a culturally
diverse society, identities are built in an interaction between values representing national identities and
subcultures and between identities and values arising from international influences. The nation’s common values are built on the diversity of cultural identities, values and cultural heritage. The formation of
cultural identity is supported by the provision of cultural services and the protection of cultural property.
Interaction between different groups as well as between the groups and national institutions is important. An international perspective helps us to understand different values and cultures, which means that
it also supports the building of the national identity.

**Operating model**

The prerequisites for artistic and creative work, cultural participation and the preservation of the cultural
heritage and passing down of cultural traditions is ensured. From the perspective of artistic and creative
work and cultural activities, people should have the opportunity to express themselves in a creative manner and to maintain international cultural contacts. In order to safeguard cultural engagement and participation, functions ensuring the availability of artistic and cultural services in all parts of Finland will be
maintained. There is a public library in every Finnish municipality and libraries are also particularly important for ensuring citizens’ right to information. Every citizen will be guaranteed the opportunity to engage
in arts and culture as a leisure activity and to participate in cultural events. The interaction and meeting
of cultural groups and the dialogue between religions are encouraged.

Nationally important cultural property contains significant cultural values and their protection must be
ensured in all security situations. Cultural heritage plays an important role in the preservation of the identity and self-esteem of individuals and communities. Many of the sites and objects included in the national cultural heritage, such as works of art, are also symbols of our national independence, and visible protection of them during crises helps to enhance citizens’ sense of security and national solidarity.

This heritage includes prehistoric sites, historically significant buildings and groups of buildings, works of
art, manuscripts, books and objects, scientific collections as well as archives and library collections. Cultural heritage also includes the buildings in which movable cultural property is stored or exhibited, digital information assets in the field of culture and science, as well as intellectual property rights, which are


-----

crystallized in copyrights. An increasing proportion of all cultural material is in digital form. The trend towards more digitalisation strengthens the role of information systems, electronic services and databases
in the protection of cultural heritage.

Regional and local level authorities must ensure that the information on the sites and characteristics of
the built cultural environment and other culturally important sites is up-to-date and universally available.
National authorities are responsible for arranging the monitoring of culturally important sites and the
functioning of national registers as well as for producing information for the owners of the sites. The authorities cooperate in the prevention of the illegal export of cultural objects.

### 52. [Ensuring the basis for religious activities ]

**Ministry in charge: Ministry of Education and Culture**

**Task and objective**

Measures are taken to ensure that the Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Finland, the Finnish Orthodox
Church and other religious communities are able to enhance the psychological resilience and well-being of the population and provide psychological assistance. Measures are taken to ensure that religious
communities are able to perform religious activities, provide psychological support as part of the national
framework of psychosocial assistance and to give crisis support in all security situations.

In addition to religious communities, psychological support is also offered by a large number of different
organisations providing a broad range of different mental health, crisis, and well-being services. These include both professional services and services provided on a voluntary basis.

**Operating model**

The Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Finland, its parishes, parish unions and cathedral chapters draw up
their own preparedness plans. The work is coordinated by each cathedral chapter in its respective area.
This preparedness planning is supported by close cooperation with regions, which also provides the
church with better opportunities to support resilience at local and national level. The parishes of the
Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Finland will maintain public cemeteries in all security situations in a dignified manner so that the memory of the deceased is respected.


-----

### 53. [Ensuring the continuation of youth work and activities as well as civic ]
**sports activities**

**Ministry in charge: Ministry of Education and Culture**

**Task and objective**

In youth work and activities, the aim is to minimise social disruptions during incidents and crises in cooperation with the authorities, organisations and other voluntary actors. Organisations and citizens play an
important role in psychological crisis management and as actors dealing with the practical issues arising
during incidents and crises. Youth organisations and actors involved in youth work possess a broad range
of expertise. Student organisations can support the maintenance of the education system at national and
local level. Political and other ideological organisations support the interaction between cultural groups.
The expertise of conservation organisations and organisations engaged in leisure time activities can also
be used in the safeguarding of the security of supply and the livelihood of the population.

**Operating model**

Youth work and youth activities are particularly important resources in crises affecting young people. The
methods used in youth work, such as enhanced youth work and services intended for young people, support young people as they are dealing with crisis situations and try to cope with them. Youth work in municipalities, organisations and parishes provides young people with tools helping them to face crises and
to cope with their consequences. Municipal youth work helps education services to operate without interruptions and supports young people by organising activities and support services in education institutions and during leisure time. A nationally organised crisis preparedness network of youth work operates
on an enhanced basis, supporting other youth work actors at regional and local level, and maintaining cooperation between the authorities. It also coordinates voluntary activities, as necessary.

Ensuring the continuation of and prerequisites for sports activities during crises is the main task of the
sports administration and non-governmental organisations. Physical functional capacity and the ability to
cope with changes and stressful situations are important during crises.

Civic activities help to create and strengthen community spirit, which in turn helps to maintain social stability. The purpose of the sports sector is to ensure the operating prerequisites for civic activities during
crises. Maintaining and using the social networks formed by civic sports organisations are key to crisis preparedness as they help to maintain citizens’ trust in society, ensure the functioning of society and provide
a channel for communications.


-----

### 54. [Communications]

**Task and objective**


**Ministries in charge:  all ministries**


Communications are a key factor in the resilience of all administrative branches. Appropriate communications help the authorities to perform their basic tasks and they also strengthen citizens’ resilience during
incidents and emergencies. From the perspective of resilience, the purpose of the communications must
be to enhance citizens’ trust and strengthen their belief in the future.

**Operating model**

Communications preparedness also means that the actors involved must be familiar with the communications practices of citizens, the media and stakeholders and that they must monitor and consider their
views, attitudes, knowledge and information needs. Websites and social media are assuming an increasingly important role. In addition to using the traditional media, citizens have direct access to the information provided by the authorities and they are also able to disseminate it. Online communications and
social media have speeded up interaction and the flow of information. The requirements concerning the
reliability, empathy and clarity of the information supplied by the authorities are becoming higher.

Good communications help citizens to recover from crises and emergencies, both physically and psychologically. Successful communications strengthen citizens’ trust in the authorities. The information that the
authorities provide on their own activities must give a realistic picture of their service level and performance. When the authorities provide information on security matters and their own work it is important
to convey the message that all individuals and organisations are also responsible for their own security.

Organisations can reach a large number of people through their networks. As part of the security work in
society, organisations act as two-way messengers: they communicate citizens’ feelings to the authorities,
while at the same time they also relay correct information to citizens. Actors taking part in the organisations’ work are able to detect weak grass-roots signals and change trends and communicate them to the
authorities and decision-makers. Organisations can teach people how to recognise information operations and strengthen their media literacy.

In order to justify their own action (for example, to secure the necessary resources), the authorities should
not give the impression that they can solve all problems because this could encourage neo-helplessness
among citizens and make people more indifferent to their own safety and the safety of others. This is particularly important during incidents and emergencies.


-----

### 55. [Combating social exclusion and inequality]

**Ministries in charge:**
**Ministry of Social Affairs and Health,**
**Ministry of Education and Culture,**
**Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment**

**Task and objective**

Social exclusion is a phenomenon where an individual, family, group of people or a section of the population suffers from a multitude of social disadvantages. Social exclusion involves the feeling of being left
outside society and problems with life management. Growing social exclusion weakens social stability and
citizens’ trust in decision-making and fairness of society. This may give rise to extremism that can be difficult to tackle by the authorities as it appears at the margins of society. Social exclusion can be alleviated
by social policy means, by action taken by organisations and religious communities and by joint measures
initiated by the authorities, companies and organisations. Adequate social security, smoothly functioning
basic services, early support and a preventive approach, which strengthens well-being, health, functional capacity and resilience, play a key role. A society where people are happy with their lives, feel healthy
and have good functional capacity has less inequality and social polarisation and fewer people living on
the fringes of society. Ensuring reasonable minimum income security, providing the neediest groups with
the necessary services as well as enhancing well-being and health are key to maintaining social cohesion.

**Operating model**

The constitutional rights to a life of dignity and the essential means of subsistence and care are guaranteed in all situations. Citizens’ well-being and health are promoted in municipalities and at regional level.
With their services and voluntary activities, organisations and religious communities provide people with
a social framework that helps to build trust, encourages citizens to engage in social issues and prevents
social exclusion. The regions, that will be established as part of the regional government reform, must anticipate and consider the impacts of their decisions on the well-being and health of different population
groups, set targets for enhancing well-being and health in the organisation and provision of social welfare and health care services, determine the measures supporting these objectives and prepare regional
well-being reports.

Finland’s education system is based on educational equality and non-discrimination. Well-being, participation and community spirit of children, young people and adults are supported through early childhood
education, education and training as well as through the maintenance of expertise and skills. Cooperation
between education services and social welfare and health care is promoted so that social exclusion can
be prevented. Social exclusion is tackled, civic engagement is encouraged and citizens’ capability to act
during incidents and emergencies is enhanced at all educational levels.


-----

### 56. [Promoting voluntary activities]

**Responsible actors:**
**all administrative branches and organisations**

**Task and objective**

In addition to playing a role in assistance work, voluntary activities strengthen the resilience and preparedness of society by providing those involved with more social capital. Voluntary activities encourage
civic participation by providing a broad range of opportunities to everybody, while at the same time they
also serve as a channel through which citizens, communities and other actors in society can influence developments.

The existence and continuity of the voluntary resources helping to secure vital functions will be ensured.
For example, reconciling paid work with voluntary activities will require new models and incentive-based
operating approaches for employers. Legislation, strategies and policy programmes can substantially help
organisations as they contribute to society’s comprehensive security.

**Operating model**

A strong voluntary sector operating on a sustainable basis must be supported by all actors in society. In
order to achieve this, the authorities and organisations work to make information on voluntary activities
more easily available, and provide information about the good practices used in voluntary activities, its
role in safe and equal society, and the opportunities that voluntary activities offer to citizens. Consideration should also be given to the financial support and visibility of voluntary activities, and to ensure that
its role is properly recognised by the authorities and other actors. The work of the organisations will be
taken into account in the drafting and implementation of legislation, strategies and policy programmes.
Competent and committed voluntary resources that are available at the right time are key to ensuring that
the work can be carried out successfully. It is important to promote equal opportunities for participation
and maintenance of expertise and skills at all levels of society. In order to ensure the availability and maintenance of voluntary resources, the authorities and organisations could improve their ability to identify
the right persons and ensure their availability. This can be by means of appropriate registers (such as the
Population Information System). Key actors include the fire brigades, Finnish Red Cross, rescue service organisations and other member organisations of the Voluntary Rescue Service Vapepa as well as voluntary
national defence organisations.


-----

### 57. [Recovery ]

**Task and objective**


**Responsible actors:**
**all administrative branches and organisations**


Today’s society is frequently affected by incidents. By compiling a situation picture, the actors involved
must also be able to assess the longer-term impacts of the incidents on society and individuals. Recovery
of the population is supported in a systematic manner. Social welfare and health care preparedness tasks
cover prevention, management of incidents and the recovery process. The recovery comprises the shortterm and long-term aftercare and recovery of society. Early childhood education, education institutions
and culture also play a role in the recovery of citizens. Organisations help to strengthen the ability of municipalities, communities and individuals to cope with the situation after a crisis. The work helps to make
individuals and communities less vulnerable to incidents in the future and the aim is also to prevent further crises. The recovery process will take several years, which means that the funding for the purpose
must be separately assessed. Particular consideration in the plans must be given to vulnerable population
groups and people that were involved in the crisis management work. Depending on the incident, the recovery process must be monitored and supported at community and national level. The aim in the aftercare process is to support the development of resilience and to ensure national cohesion.

**Operating model**

All incidents must be followed by the assessment of aftercare needs and the planning of the aftercare process and a planning group comprising key experts should be set up for the purpose. Systematic communications are key to a successful aftercare process. They will calm down those involved and the population at large, strengthen their sense of security and make them more resilient to crises. The aftercare will
be launched and its progress will be monitored. Aftercare will be supported by means of research. Aftercare also includes the assessment of incident management and drawing lessons from it. Regional social
welfare and health care services, home municipalities of those involved, and the cooperation with early
childhood education units and education institutions play a key role. In community support, consideration
is given to families, close relatives, sports associations and other organisations, as well as the home municipalities of those involved. Extensive use of the voluntary activities provided by organisations in the aftercare process, initiative and cooperation between organisations speed up the recovery of communities
and individuals and strengthen resilience. Psychosocial support will be launched by the authorities and it
is coordinated by the social welfare and health care services. Resources of the national social welfare and
health care actors are used in this process. The recovery and aftercare plan will be drawn up in cooperation with organisations and communities and the engagement of citizens must be considered in the document. Coordination of psychosocial support in the regions will be developed and an expert network of
psychosocial support will be established in Finland.

**1. concept for comprehensive** kokonaisturvallisuus
**security; comprehensive** _sv_

övergripande säkerhet  inte: totalsäkerhet

**security**

_definition_ A state where measures have been taken to prepare for threats and risks facing vital
_functions of society_

_note_ In the Government Resolution on Comprehensive Security (5 December 2012), compre-
hensive security is defined as a desired state in which the threats against vital functions
of society are at manageable levels.

Management of comprehensive security or the maintenance of the vital functions of so-
ciety consists of the preparedness for the threats, management of incidents and emer-
_gencies and the recovery from them._

According to the Government’s Security and Defence Policy Report (2012), the prepared-
ness of Finnish society is based on the comprehensive concept of security, which means
that vital functions of society are safeguarded through cooperation between the authori-
ties, business operators, organisations and citizens.

The term “comprehensive security” refers to overall security and a broad concept of se-
curity. Comprehensive security is a Finnish concept and for this reason it is used in combi-
nation with the expression “concept for”.

**2. vital function of society** yhteiskunnan elintärkeä toiminto

_sv_
samhällets vitala funktion; vital samhällsfunktion

_definition_ A function that is essential for the functioning of society.

_note_ Management of government affairs, international activities, defence capability, internal
security, economy, infrastructure and security of supply, functional capacity of the pop-
ulation and services, and psychological crisis resilience are considered as the vital func-
tions of society.

**3. continuity management;** jatkuvuudenhallinta
**business continuity** _sv_

kontinuitetshantering; hantering av kontinuitet

**management**

_definition_ An organisational process enhancing security of supply that helps to identify the threats
against the operations, to assess their impacts on the organisation and its network of ac-
tors and to create operational procedures for the management of serious incidents and
continuity of operations.

_note_ Continuity management is a strategic and operational function approved by the organisa-
tion’s top management enabling the organisation to prepare for the management of dis-
ruptions and continue its operations at a pre-defined acceptable level.

The priority in continuity management is on disruptions occurring in normal conditions
but the process may also include preparedness for emergencies.

Even though continuity management is usually on a voluntary basis, in a number of sec-
tors organisations have a statutory obligation to ensure the continuity of their operations
in all circumstances.

The concept of continuity management originates from the business world but it has also
been adopted by a growing number of other organisations.

_sv_
regional gemensam beredskap; gemensam beredskap

_definition_ A field of preparedness which takes place within the area of a county and in which the
authorities, municipalities, business operators and organisations operating in the area
participate together.

_note_ The counties see to the tasks associated with regional joint preparedness and provide the
prerequisites for the cooperation. For example, the counties must ensure that the differ-
ent actors jointly assess any risks of regional significance, monitor and evaluate changes
affecting safety and security in the operating environment, make plans for preparedness
and organise preparedness exercises in the county.

Joint regional preparedness does not replace or restrict the management, coordination
and supervision tasks or responsibilities related to the preparedness of different sectors.

The term joint preparedness may also refer to joint preparedness within the Government.

**emergency planning;**
**individual emergency**
**planning**

_definition_ Action taken by private individuals and communities in which the aim is to prevent acci-
dents and to prepare for dangerous situations

_note_ Independent preparedness by households means preparedness measures taken by private in-
dividuals, housing communities and families for situations where normal daily life is disrupted.

Independent preparedness comprises preparedness arrangements by housing units, offic-
es, agencies, industrial companies and other business operators.

The activities required under the Rescue Act (379/2011) are an example of independent
preparedness. Under the act, owners and occupants of buildings and business and industri-
al operators must for their part prepare for the protection of persons, property and the en-
vironment in dangerous situations and for extinguishing fires and taking other such rescue
action which they are capable of performing independently. Special acts also contain provi-
sions on the preparedness obligations of private individuals.

The independent preparedness obligation applies to everybody but under the Rescue Act,
an emergency plan must be drawn up for specific sites.

_note_ Incidents include major natural accidents, such as storm damage and sudden rise in water
levels. There are also incidents caused by human activity, such as riots and terrorism.

Incidents may occur in normal conditions and during emergencies.

An incident may affect the whole country or it may only have regional or local impacts. An
incident may also affect a single function, such as the cash supply.

A serious incident is more serious that other types of incident but less serious than an
emergency.

The words “crisis” and “catastrophe” are often used in everyday language. In many cas-
es, the term “incident”, “disruption” or “emergency” would be more accurate. For exam-
ple, the Prime Minister’s Office, which is responsible for Government preparedness has re-
placed the word “crisis” with the term “incident”, “disruption” or “emergency”, which are
more accurate descriptions of the event or situation in question.

The term “disturbance” refers to more serious incidents that are caused by human activity.
These include large-scale riots that may be violent. For this reason, the word “disturbance”
should not be used when talking about incidents or disruptions.

**_emergency_**

_definition_ A state referred to in the Emergency Powers Act, in which so many incidents occur or
they are of such serious nature that it is necessary to provide the authorities with emer-
gency powers.

_note_ The Government and the President of the Republic must jointly determine that an emer-
gency exists. Provisions on the emergency powers of the authorities are contained in the
Emergency Powers Act (1552/2011) and these powers are introduced by Government de-
cree (implementation decree).

Under the Emergency Powers Act (1552/2011), the following situations are considered as
emergencies:

1) an armed or equally serious attack against Finland and its immediate aftermath,
2) a serious threat of an armed or equally serious attack against Finland the impacts of
which can only be prevented if the powers laid down in the Emergency Powers Act are
immediately introduced,
3) an extremely serious event or threat targeting the livelihood of the population or the
foundations of the country’s economy as a result of which the vital functions of soci-
ety are endangered to an essential extent,
4) a major disaster and its immediate aftermath, and
5) a dangerous contagious disease that has spread over large areas and that has impacts
similar to those of a major disaster.

The impact of emergencies on the activities of the authorities varies, depending on the
authority concerned and the emergency in question. For this reason, in appropriate
emergency preparedness, the tasks of the authorities must be specifically defined for
each emergency and the impacts of the emergency on the authorities’ activities must
be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Each authority must ensure that its tasks are also
carried out in an emergency, to the extent possible. Most of the tasks are practically the
same as those performed in normal conditions but the methods, prioritisation and the
number of tasks may be different. It may also be necessary to use protective equipment
and work in shelters. There are also statutory rights and obligations that are only applied
during emergencies.
