## Introduction 

State and its citizens' security assurance belongs to the vital national interests of the
Republic of Poland. National security denotes the state's and its society's ability to provide
conditions for its existence and development, territorial integrity, political independence,
internal stability and quality of life. This ability is formed through activities consisting in taking
advantage of chances, accepting challenges, reducing risk and eliminating internal and
external threats, what provides duration, identity, functioning and freedom of development of
the state and the nation (society)[1].

Processes taking place in contemporary, global environment of security possess
overwhelming influence on national security of Poland of the 21[st] century. They are
characterised by high dynamics, complexity of alterations and by occurrence of asymmetrical
threats among which the most dangerous are: terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction and means of their delivery, international organised crime and cyberspace
threats. Also potential challenges may become threats, if there is no reaction to them. They
include such phenomena as destabilisation of political system, malfunctioning of economic
and social mechanisms, mass violations of human rights, impoverishing of societies, limited
water resources, degradation of natural environment, natural disasters, increasing demand
for energy connected with hindered access to energy resources, exhausting resources of
rare metals as well as demographic issues. Primary chances to reinforce national security
should be sought in strengthening the role of Poland in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
and the European Union, as well as in building better relations with neighbouring countries.

Counteracting all potential threats to security requires an integrated system of national
**security guaranteeing fast and efficient actions in all conditions and in a reaction to threats**
and crises of all type. The necessity to prepare, control and improve the national security
system is stipulated in the _National Security Strategy of the Republic of Poland [PL. Strategia_
_Bezpieczeństwa Narodowego Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej] of November 13, 2007 which has_
formularised the definition and has created theoretical foundations of functioning of such a
system.[2] The national security system constitutes the entirety of forces, means and
resources assigned by the state to perform tasks in the field of security, being adequately
organised, controlled and prepared for these tasks, in which the management subsystem
and a number of executive subsystems are distinguished.

External security conditions of Poland, intensive development of its economic potential and
extending its involvement in active development of international security environment as well
as increasing 'sensitivity' of open societies to contemporary threats, impose gradual
optimisation of forces and means of national security toward creation of an integrated,
comprehensive national security system enabling simultaneous use of elements of national
**defence system and crisis management system[3].** Integrated planning and preparing of
military and civil components on each level of reacting, comprehensive approach to resolving
crisis situations and regulation and assignment of tasks in this scope to public administration
and also creation of stable foundations of financing those tasks, is the mainspring of growth
of the level of national security and the effective tool for its implementation.

strategy.

Adopting new regulations of conducting development policy by the Council of Ministers in
2009 enables the alteration of former approach to the national security policy and connecting
it with the social-economic development policy. The governmental _Plan of Ordering_
_Development Strategies [PL. Plan uporządkowania strategii rozwoju] with the concept to put_
in order effective strategic documents[4] aimed at implementing the mid- and long-term
national strategy of state's development[5], included the Development Strategy of the National
_Security System of the Republic of Poland [PL. Strategia rozwoju systemu bezpieczeństwa_
_narodowego Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej]_ into the group of nine integrated national
development strategies. This solution offers a chance to strengthen the implementation layer
of the strategy and initiation of a new impulse to works related to establishing of the
integrated national security system, in association with the social-economic development of
the state.

_The_ _Long-term National Development Strategy “Poland 2030. The Third Wave of Modernity”_
acknowledges the provision of external and internal security as a condition indispensable for
auspicious development of Poland[6]. The similar approach is represented by _the_ _Mid-term_
_National Development Strategy 2020_ (MNDS) which acknowledges _the_ _Consolidation of_
_National Security(I.3.4) [PL._ _Utrwalanie bezpieczeństwa narodowego] as one of the_
directions of the public intervention in the strategic area: the _Efficient and Effective State [PL._
_Sprawne i efektywne państwo]. In particular MNDS indicates the necessity to 'undertake and_
conclude fast works on the integrated national security system.[7]

The realisation of this demand constitutes _the_ _Strategy of Development of the National_
_Security System of the Republic of Poland 2022[8]. It defines conditions of functioning and_
methods of development of the national security system. The particular role in this system is
played by the entities responsible for the external security (diplomatic service, the Polish
Armed Forces, intelligence agencies), in cooperation with entities responsible for the internal
security. Taking this into consideration, the main area of interest of this strategy will be

4 The development strategies have been prepared on the basis of Art. 9, sec. 3 of _the Act of December 6, 2006_
_on the Principles of Pursuing Development Policy (Journal of Laws of 2009, No. 84, item 712, as amended)._
5 The Long-term National Development Strategy “Poland 2030. The Third Wave of Modernity” (LTNDS) [PL.
_Długookresowa strategia rozwoju kraju,,Polska 2030._ _Trzecia fala nowoczesności'' (DSRK)] indicates primary_
trends and challenges resulting from both internal development of the state and transformations in its external
environment. It also presents comprehensive vision of socio-economic state in the perspective by 2030, taking
regional and spatial dimension into consideration. Whereas **_the_** **_Mid-term National Development Strategy_**
_(MNDS)_ [PL. Średniookresowa strategia rozwoju kraju (ŚSRK)] is a leading development strategy defining
fundamental conditions, goals and directions of the state development in the social, economic, regional and
spatial dimension. MNDS defines areas of strategic intervention of domestic and superregional significance and
also strategic investments which are subsequently accounted in other development strategies and programmes.
Therefore, the integration of the spatial policy with the regional policy and concentration of national pro-growth
operations in key thematic and spatial fields is provided. The effective MNDS is _the_ _National Development._
_Strategy 2020. Active Society, Competitive Economy, Efficient State [PL._ _Strategia Rozwoju Kraju 2020. Aktywne_
_społeczeństwo, konkurencyjna gospodarka, sprawne państwo] adopted by the resolution No. 157 of the Council_
of Ministers of September 25, 2012 (Monitor Polski of 2012, item 882)
6 LTNDS, p. 19.
7 MNDS, p. 54, 152.
8 In connection with the necessity to harmonise the time horizon with the horizon of the executive documents of
the area of defence planning (determined by the planning cycle of NATO), for this strategy the horizon by 2022
has been adopted.
9 The remaining development strategies also concern various aspects of fields of national security, although to a
smaller extent. They include the _Development Strategy of Transport, National Strategy of Regional Development -_
_Regions - Cities - Rural Areas, Strategy for Sustainable Development of Rural Areas, Agriculture and Fisheries_

[PL. Strategia rozwoju transportu, Krajowa strategia rozwoju regionalnego – Regiony – miasta – obszary wiejskie,
_Strategia zrównoważonego rozwoju wsi, rolnictwa i rybactwa]_ and the _Development Strategy of Human Capital._
Relations between SRSBN RP (the Strategy of Development of the National Security System of the Republic of
_Poland 2022) and the remaining integrated development strategies are illustrated in Table 1._

directed towards external and military security. Integration of the _Strategy of Development of_
_the National Security System of the Republic of Poland 2022 with other development_
strategies allows to exclude from its thematic scope other areas of the national security, such
as economic (including energy), civil, social or environmental security. Due to the necessity
for specialisation and detailed specification of the development strategy and their mutual
complementarity, the analysis of these fields of national security together with indication of
their objectives and directions of intervention are to be found respectively in _the_ _Strategy of_
_Innovation and Efficiency of Economy [PL. Strategia innowacyjności i efektywności_
_gospodarki],_ _the_ _Energy Security and Environment Strategy_ [PL. _Bezpieczeństwo_
_energetyczne i środowisko],_ _the_ _Efficient State 2020_ strategy and in _the_ _Development_
_Strategy of Social Capital [PL. Strategia rozwoju kapitału społecznego][9]._

_The_ _National Security of the Republic of Poland which was approved by the President of the_
Republic of Poland, remains the concept base[10] for _the_ _Strategy of Development of the_
_National Security System of the Republic of Poland 2022 which was incorporated in the_
governmental system of managing national development. Both strategies are coherent in
terms of the subject matter, whereas they differ in the level of detailed specification and
methodological approach. Concurrently with coming into force of this strategy, _the_ _Defence_
_Strategy of the Republic of Poland_ [PL. Strategia obronności Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej] _[11]_
and _the_ _Participation Strategy of the Polish Armed Forces in International Operations_ [PL.
_Strategia udziału Sił Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej w operacjach międzynarodowych]_
_12 are no longer in force._

_The_ _Strategy of Development of the National Security System of the Republic of Poland 2022_
is also correlated with the most important strategic documents of the North Atlantic Alliance
and the European Union within the scope of security - NATO Strategic Concept and
European Security Strategy[13]. The reformatory actions which concern strengthening of the
state’s defence capabilities are included in chapter III and are compatible with the _Primary_
_directions of development of the Polish Armed Forces and their preparations for national_
_defence for 2013 - 2022_ [PL. Główne kierunki rozwoju Sił Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej
_Polskiej oraz ich przygotowań do obrony państwa na lata 2013-2022] adopted by the_
President of the Republic of Poland on November 8, 2011.

Directions of operating of this strategy will be orientated toward two main principles:
**efficiency and cohesion –** therefore, its primary objective will be Strengthening of Efficiency
_and Cohesion of the National Security System. Efficiency will be achieved through increasing_
capabilities of essential elements of the national security system - it will be served by the
fulfilment of the first objective: Formation of Stable International Security Environment in
_Regional and Global Dimension,_ the second objective: _Strengthening of National Defence_
_Capabilities_ and the third objective _Development of Resilience against Threats to National_
_Security. Thanks to the fulfilment of the fourth objective:_ _Increase of integration between_
_public policies and the security policy and the fifth: Creation of conditions for development of_

10 The effective National Security Strategy of the Republic of Poland was approved by the President of
the Republic of Poland on November 13, 2007.

_the integrated national security system, cohesion of the national security system will be_
provided (both externally and internally). The proposed actions within the scope of cohesion
will be performed successively - firstly, they will be aimed at increasing cooperation and
coordination, secondly - at integration. Objectives 1, 2 and 3 are therefore of operational
(executive) nature, whereas objectives 4 and 5 are of systemic and coordination nature.

## Summary

Strategy of Development of the National Security System of the Republic of Poland 2022
(SRSBN RP) defines the conditions of functioning and methods of development of the
national security system which increase its efficiency and cohesion in the mid-term
perspective. In horizon of the document being in force, a strategic focus is put on
establishment of the **integrated national security system** based on allied and bilateral
securities and guarantees gradually developed own civil-military potential. It is an
implementation of the postulate of the mid-term National Development Strategy 2020 which
in the strategic area _Efficient and Effective State indicates the necessity to 'undertake and_
conclude fast works on the integrated national security system'.

SRSBN RP is a document of a new generation including requirements of the modern system
of managing development of the state. For the first time, **the strategy from the area of**
**national security has been drawn up in relation to the socio-economic policy of the**
**state and has been based on the methodology enabling to carry out its included intentions.**
The structure of SRSBN RP has been defined by the updated Act of December 6, 2006 on
_the Principles of Development Policy,_ whereas the scope pertaining to the content of the
strategy has been indicated in the Plan of Ordering the Development Strategies adopted by
the Council of Ministers. Therefore, SRSBN RP concentrates on external and military
security - its integration with the remaining development strategies permitted to exclude it
from its primary thematic scope of other areas of national security, such as economic
(including energy), civil, social, food or environmental security.

**Diagnosis of the national security system** analyses external and internal conditions
(chapter I). The evaluation of the security environment of Poland indicates good use of
opportunities resulting from the membership of our state in international organisations.
Whereas the issue requiring increased efforts is inter-sector and asymmetrical nature of
contemporary threats and unpredictability of development of security environment. Actions of
respective elements of the national security system were positively assessed, although the
necessity for further improvements was indicated. A small amount of system solutions
integrating the national security was considered as a serious limitation. It is still necessary to
strengthen the role and significance of the strategy in our legal system and stray off the
sector approach to the security issue.

On the basis of the diagnosis, there are presented **the challenges and the vision of**
**development of the national security system of the Republic of Poland. Optimisation of**
forces and means of national security will denote effective use of potentials hidden in the
national defence system and in the crisis management system. The vision of development of
the security system assumes that by 2020 Poland will be the state of a high security level,
actively creating foreign policy, administering modern national defence and efficient
intelligence agencies.

**Strengthening of efficiency and cohesion of the national security system** has been
considered the main objective of SRSBN RP. The system should be capable of identifying
and eliminating sources, symptoms and consequences of threats to national security.
**Efficiency** will be achieved through improving capacity of primary elements of the national
security system, **cohesion -** through increasing integration between public policies and the
security policy and reinforcing cooperation and coordination and ultimately the achievement
of integration inside the national security system.

Operational objectives constitute development of the main objective in the fields possessing
key significance for security. **The first objective is** **_formation of stable international_**
**_security environment in regional and global dimension_** through intensifying international
cooperation, what serves strengthening of essential, from the Polish perspective,
international institutions, developing friendly relations with neighbours and gaining prestige
and international position of the country. Priority of objective 1 is to **increase efficiency of**


-----

**implementing Polish priorities in NATO and the EU** and taking care of effectiveness of
allied mechanisms. Actions for strengthening collective defence within NATO and intensifying
the collaboration with partners from Eastern Europe within the EU and NATO will be the most
fundamental in this area. Priority will be also to **increase efficiency of bilateral and**
**multilateral cooperation, particularly with the USA** and in the formula of the Visegrad Group
and the Weimar Triangle. Co-establishment of stable security environment will also require
increased effectiveness of international law and international institutions and competent use
of international instruments within the scope of non-proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction and means of their delivery, control of armaments and disarmaments, confidence
and security building measures or development aid.

The **second objective** is subject of the constitutional obligations and of the allied liabilities
and concerns **_strengthening of the national capacity for defence._** In recent years there
have been many alterations in organisation of national defence resulting in its perception in
wider categories. Changes in the security environment and in technological progress caused
that today defence is understood as the sum of all military and non-military undertakings
aiming at confronting political and military threats to national security. Implementation of
priorities and carrying out directions of intervention of objective 2 will provide Poland with
protection of vital national interests and strong position on the international arena and
particularly in NATO and the EU. The continuation of building professional and modern
**Polish Armed Forces is of priority significance. It will be carried out through their technical**
modernisation and increasing training level as well as refining the organisational structure
including the command and control system.

Efficient armed forces need support of the Civilian Sector which participates in defence
preparations of the state. Top priority will be given to the extended cooperation with Polish
**defence industry and scientific and research potential related with it** and their more
active participation in international programmes and initiatives will be very significant. It will
improve competitiveness and innovations for the domestic defence industry and its export
capacity and, as a result, it will increase the level of modernity of Polish economy and
provide new workplaces. In the context of providing continuity of the functioning of the state
in conditions of external threat to security, it is important to improve non-military defence
preparations. Operations of **civil and military intelligence agencies** will remain invariably
important, directed at increasing their efficiency and cohesion, in particular in the area of
reconnaissance of and protection against contemporary threats.

The **third objective** is directed at **_development of resilience to threats to national_**
**_security, including extraordinary situations and unexpected events. It concerns this sphere_**
of activity of the state which does not fit in the traditional classification of executive
subsystems or in departments of the government administration. It is of intersector nature.
The objective will be primarily fulfilled through the **strengthened protection of the critical**
**infrastructure and** **construction of the system of strategic reserves. Directions of**
intervention depicted in the strategy will improve the cooperation between operators of the
critical infrastructure and public administration bodies and will increase effectiveness,
adequacy and cohesion of the system of strategic reserves.

The area of interest of the fourth objective is the increase of integration between public
**policies and the security policy. The priorities and the directions of intervention grouped**
around the objective on the one hand present actions of the security sector to strengthen
fulfilment of the targets of the development policy and on the other hand, they depict
possibilities of using potential of the civil society for security. Therefore, it will be fundamental
to strengthen connections between national security and the area of education, protection of
national heritage, supporting employment and counteracting unemployment, environmental
protection, infrastructure, spatial planning and regional development. Together with the
increasing significance of the social capital for the state’s functioning, it will be also important
to support cooperation with civil organisations acting for national security and defence.


-----

The **fifth objective, the most crucial for successive consolidation of the national security**
potential, is directed at creation of conditions for development of the integrated national
**_security system. The proposals of alterations presented in the objective are of the most_**
broad and systemic character. The priority of the objective 5 is refinement of the
management system of the national security. Development of the integrated national security
system will also require more efficient use of potentials hidden in the national defence
system and in the crisis management system. Therefore, the greater integration of the
planning processes will be necessary together with the intensification of monitoring and
evaluation of development of the national security system. Cyclic reviews of national security
will serve this purpose. The challenges identified in the diagnosis and negative phenomena
related thereto in cyberspace require implementation of strategies of protection of ICT
resources of public and national administration proposed in the objective 5. Also Government
Communication Network used for communication of authorised persons in the event of crisis
situation will be developed.

**Strategy Implementation System** defines assignment areas of the primary entities
responsible for realisation of a strategy and implementation documents. The system of
indicators has been established as the supervision basis for fulfilling SRSBN RP objectives.
The indicators will be used for analytical and evaluative operations enabling observation of
occurring changes from the perspective of efficiency and effectiveness of interventions being
carried out. Drawing up of cyclical reports and information presenting the degree of
implementation of the strategy is anticipated. _The_ _Strategy of Development of the National_
_Security System of the Republic of Poland 2022 will be subject to periodical actualisation at_
least once every 4 years. An important modification in the Polish security environment or
new, significant solutions within the scope of developing the national security system, may
constitute a basis for updating.

The Minister of National Defence is the coordinator of the strategy implementation and he
acts on behalf of the Prime Minister. Each year, the coordinator shall submit the strategy
implementation report for the previous year to the Minister of Regional Development. This
report is a contribution to the information about fulfilment of MNDS objectives. The first report
on SRSBN RP implementation will be presented in 2014.

The financial framework of the strategy depicts the scope of public resources assigned for
fulfilment of objectives of the strategy. Financing of assignments within the scope of defence
will be pursued through the use of resources from the national budget within the scope of
function 11, supported by resources from the Armed Forces Modernisation Fund. In turn,
actions for the stable international security environment will be financed within the scope of
the function 15. of the national budget.
The strategy also includes Bibliography and List of abbreviations. The Report on the Course
_of Social Consultations of the Strategy Project is presented in the appendix._

## I. Diagnosis of the national security system

**1. External conditions - security environment**

**1.1. Strategic context**

The key factors determining the shape of current international relations are the globalisation
**processes manifesting themselves in permanent development of freedom of flow of ideas,**
goods, services, money and people. The consequences of these processes are of a dual
nature. Globalisation contributes to the increase of the civilisation development level on a
global scale, yet also to considerable intensification of developmental differences between
states and inside societies. The compound net of economic, political and communication
interconnections incline states and nations of the world to cooperate peacefully, yet creating
new areas and possibilities of confrontation[14].

The current level of integration of global economic life is the reason for sudden changes,
breakdowns of economic situation and crises, taking place not only in the nearest
surroundings of Poland but also in different regions of the world which may negatively
influence stability of Polish economy and thereby the state's security. Economic crisis of the
recent years considerably affected the global situation in the field of security, slowing down
or levelling economic growth of numerous countries, including also close partners and allies
of Poland.

**Transfer** **of the centre of global power balance from the Euro-Atlantic region to the region**
of Asia and Pacific will be accompanied by the gradual evolution of significance and
possibility of global impinging of China, India, Brazil and other rising powers. States of the
'West' are still leading in many fields, however the authoritarian model becomes, in the eyes
of some countries and their leaders, an actual alternative to Western universalism.

The increasing **demand for energy resources contributes to their use to put political**
pressure and more and more often they substitute military power in fulfilment of goals of a
state's policy. Tensions produced by temporary limitations in gas delivery to some countries
indicate weakness of energy market and negative influence of politics on economy. Depleting
of resources of rare metals may become another crucial challenge of dynamic nature.

There are still other potential threats: increasing number of failing and failed states, tensions
and conflicts in regions of diminished stability in the Euro-Atlantic region or in its
neighbourhood, terrorism, international organised crime, negative phenomena in cyberspace
and crisis situations in consequence of natural and man-made disasters.

Contemporary world does not remain defenceless against global challenges and threats.
International community, including Poland, administers wide spectrum of possibilities of
strengthening their security. One of the most important instruments forming the security
environment is the **North Atlantic Alliance.** Historically, the Alliance owes its exceptional
efficiency on one hand to the military potential and the wide spectrum of operational
instruments, on the other to unity resulting from values shared by its members. The priority
significance is possessed by provision of the appropriate balance in the hierarchy of
assignments and activities of the Alliance between its original functions (collective defence,
consultation forum) and the role of a stabiliser of international situation through the partner
cooperation and non-Art. 5 operations. The condition of the above is to guarantee due
credibility of alliance obligations, inter alia through diverse forms of strengthening collective
defence (contingency plans, training, NATO Response Force, development of defence

-----

infrastructure). In this context, it is particularly crucial to fulfil the Alliance obligations resulting
from the Art. 3 of the North Atlantic Treaty which directly orders to maintain and develop
one's individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack.

Development of the **European integration is a factor of an enormous significance for**
strengthening security in the Euro-Atlantic region. Thanks to the unique nature of versatile
cooperation in its framework, development of the European Union persistently improves
European stability in all its dimensions. Development of the instruments of cooperation with
partners’ influences in a stabilising manner the neighbouring regions and contributes to the
increase of mutual trust. The adoption of the _Treaty of Lisbon[15] opens new possibilities of_
further advancing and compounding of integration processes and the complete use of its
potential may in future result in establishment of the common defence of the EU and in
provision of additional security guarantees for Poland.

The development of **regional security environment in Europe advances still in the**
favourable direction from the Polish perspective. In the scale of the continent, the scope and
intensity of international cooperation is constantly increasing. The North Atlantic Alliance, the
European Union, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and
other regional and sub-regional structures provide solid institutional bases for this
cooperation. The progress of processes of democratisation and economic transformation is
still being achieved, especially in Southern Europe. In some countries in the region,
maintaining a not fully democratic legal order, as well as periodical disclosing of
confrontational positions in politics, prompt some worries. The maintaining of stability of
regional security order in Europe is to a considerable degree dependent upon amendment of
disciplines of armaments and disarmament control and confidence and security building
measures, determined in the _Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE_
Treaty)[16], the Treaty on Open Skies _[17]_ and in the Vienna Document 1999[18].

The analysis of characteristics of the contemporary international security environment
indicates that in the next few years, the principal challenges and threats for Poland will be
related to:

-  dynamics of the relations within NATO and the EU and to the US engagement in European

security;

-  dynamics of changes in disciplines of armaments and disarmament control aiming at their

increased efficiency;

-  dynamics of bilateral and multilateral relations;

-  provision of efficiency of international law;

-  local conflicts affecting global security;

-  international terrorism and international organised crime;

-  progressing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and means of their delivery.

**1.2. Opportunities for security of Poland**

The aforementioned processes and phenomena forming international security environment
significantly influence security of Poland. In addition, security of our state is affected also by
factors of a regional and local character.

**Membership of the Republic of Poland in the North Atlantic Alliance and in the**
**European Union constitutes the guarantee of security of the state and offers the possibility**
of multidimensional development and an increase of the role of Poland on the international
arena. The opportunity for Polish security policy are also good relations with neighbouring
**states - with many of our neighbours and partners, we aim to establish and achieve strategic**
partnership.

States of Eastern Europe, with which we tighten relations within the scope of bilateral
relations and the cooperation with NATO and the EU, remain the area of a special interest of
Poland. It lies in the Polish interest to provide influence on evolution of NATO and European
Union and to maintain and improve potential of these structures. The next opportunity for
both Poland and the whole world should be sought in strengthening of international law and
provision of its general respect, development of legal norms and executive mechanisms
which will be efficient tools in fighting against new threats, especially related to proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, organised crime and the phenomenon of failed
states. The important form of cooperation enabling elimination of sources of many threats for
international security is the development aid.

**1.3. Threats to and challenges for security of Poland**

The favourable shape of international security environment and Polish allied associations
conduces towards the little probability of conventional armed aggression at present and in
the nearest future. However, the occurrence near the border of the Republic of Poland of a
situation when force is used or of a threat to use it, cannot be entirely excluded. Moreover,
considering the incidence in the neighbourhood of Poland of military potentials, including the
unconventional ones, Poland is going to maintain and develop capabilities enabling an
efficient reaction to threats of such a kind. Simultaneously Poland will take care of
maintaining openness, clarity and predictability of military activity, provided by the system of
armament control and the regional confidence and security building measures.

The threat to security of Poland arises from questioning the efficiency of the international
system of counteracting **proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.** **International**
**terrorism[19] is equally dangerous. Even though the terrorist threat in Poland remains on a low**
level, it frequently concerns Polish citizens staying in the unstable regions and above all
soldiers participating in foreign military missions. The terrorists' attempts of carrying out a
terrorist attack on territory of an EU member state also cannot be excluded. The constant
threats to national security of Poland are also posed by **activities of foreign intelligence**
**agencies aiming at obtaining information within the scope of economic, political, scientific**
and technical intelligence.

**Differences in perception of challenges and threats to security and individual benefits**
**by the NATO and EU** **members in connection with unclear and unpredictable development**
of the security environment may constitute a serious defiance for this international
community. The evolution of the North Atlantic Alliance which more and more frequently from
the regional security organisation transforms into the alliance of a global impingement might
evoke anxiety. This situation might result in the weakening of the allied obligations for

international terrorism. This document is the executive document of the Efficient State 2020 strategy.

Poland. Concentration of the United States’ interest in non-European[20] regions becomes a
similar challenge.

Another challenge for Polish and European security policy is to define the significance and
**location of European Union on the global scene, in particular in the light of existent**
disproportions between the capabilities of the EU in the economic zone and the lack of actual
instruments in the area of foreign and security policies. Even though, the _Treaty of Lisbon_
provides it with the instruments enabling efficient affecting of global processes, the degree of
their use is largely dependent upon the political will of member states.

**The weakness of the system of international organisations (including the United**
Nations), as well as **international disciplines of armaments and disarmament control**
**and non-proliferation** which does not demonstrate sufficient effectiveness, should be
acknowledged as the challenge for the Polish security policy, as well as for the global one.
For Europe, it is especially crucial to form a new discipline of conventional armaments control

-  the previous system, based on the _CFE Treaty, was called into question by one of the_
countries being a participant of this treaty.

In recent years, challenges for energy security of Poland which influences the functioning of
all sectors of domestic economy, are accumulating. The energy sector, considering its key
significance for functioning of economy, directly influences also the capabilities of the Polish
Armed Forces[21]. Dependence upon deliveries of natural gas and crude oil from one source
and limited abilities of transporting and storing energy carriers noticeably decreases
resiliance of our state against crisis situations related to energy security and caused by the
factor of political or technical nature.

A serious challenge for Poland remains counteracting and fighting against **negative**
**phenomena in cyberspace, international** **organised crime[22], threats produced by**
**impingement of forces of nature (flood, long-term droughts and local shortages of water,**
large fires, hurricane winds, landslips and mudslides or epidemic of infectious diseases) or
**human activity (technical failures, communication disasters).**

The fundamental challenge for national security is to provide **food security on the level**
guaranteeing even the minimal food self-sufficiency of the state for which maintaining of the
appropriate production base in the agricultural and food sector is indispensable. Also food
security, in terms of its quality, is becoming more significant together with the intensification
of occurring of various health, phytosanitary and veterinary risks, closely relating to inter alia
the increase of flows of commercial food goods[23].

**2. Internal Conditions**

**2.1. National Security System**

Efficient fulfilment of goals of the security policy requires maintaining and developing by the
Republic of Poland the national security system integrated with the allied security system
through common operating procedures in crisis situations and in time of war and participation

in allied defence planning. The national security system aims to adequately prepare and use
forces and means belonging to the state to counteract risks threatening survival of the nation
and the state, territorial integrity, political independence and sovereignty, efficient functioning
of national institutions and socio-economic development. It is the system encompassing both
the elements of external and internal security, directed at provision of national security in
connection with socio-economic development of the state[24].

Integration processes in the field of security had become the guiding principle of the National
_Security Strategy of the Republic of Poland published in 2007. Pursuant to its content, the_
**national security system is created by all bodies and institutions of legislature, executive**
power and the judiciary, responsible for security in the light of the Constitution of the
Republic of Poland and competent acts, including the Parliament, President of the Republic
of Poland, Prime Minister, the Council of Ministers, central bodies of government
administration and other central agencies and national institutions. The crucial elements are
the armed forces and services and government institutions obliged to prevent and counteract
external threats, provide public security, carry out rescue operations and secure population
and property in extraordinary situations and also local government authorities and various
legal entities including entrepreneurs creating an industrial defence potential and carrying out
assignments within the scope of national defence[25].

The aforementioned strategy specifies that the national security system consists of the
national security management subsystem and of the executive subsystems. Bodies of public
authority and directors of organisational units which carry out assignments related to national
security and military command authorities of the Polish Armed Forces - all form the
**management subsystem. In turn, the** **executive subsystems create forces and means**
remaining in competence of ministers managing activities of the government administration,
central bodies of the government administration, province governors, authorities of local
government and other national institutions and entities responsible for carrying out the
statutory determined assignments within the scope of national security.

Completing the analysis included in the National Security Strategy of the Republic of Poland,
an important part in providing national security is played by the **support systems of**
**national security[26] which do not fit in any traditional classification. They include i.a.**
protection of the critical infrastructure and the system of strategic reserves and also a range
of additional detailed operational systems (for instance: the state border protection system,
the flood protection system, the personal data protection system and the system of protection
of classified information). Developing them does duty to obtain resilience against threats to
national security, including extraordinary situations and unexpected events.

Polish law does not comprehensively regulate functioning of the national security system.
The lack of regulations on organisation and functioning of the national security system in one
legal act frequently results in sectoral and dispersed actions of entities responsible for the
individual fields of national security. The previously carried out actions fulfilling the duty of
integrating efforts of the entities responsible for national security were filling the most
important gaps, however, they did not introduce systemic and comprehensive solutions in the
scale of the entire state.

24 Means of the security policy, comprehended as resources and instruments, generated and used by the state
and socio-economic development provides availability of these means. Therefore, strengthening national security
positively influences and in some situations even determines further development of the state.
25 _The National Security Strategy of the Republic of Poland of November 2007, p. 21_
26 The support systems complete the executive subsystems established by forces and means remaining in
competence of ministers managing activities of the government administration, central bodies of the government
administration, province governors, local government authorities and different entities responsible for carrying out
the statutorily determined assignments within the scope of national security.


-----

In the legal sense, the national security system does not therefore constitute an
independently functioning national structure. As the primary form of its organisation and
activity remains the **national defence system maintained to provide protection of vital**
national interests and especially sovereignty and independence of the Polish nation and its
right for territorial and border integrity. Its principal purpose is provision of military security
and maintaining of the state's potential guaranteeing the ability to effectively respond to
external political and military crises and - in the event of war - the capacity to quickly repel
aggression. The process that integrates functioning of all elements of the national defence
system is defence planning which enables to set and fulfil targets in the field of defence.

Apart from the national defence system, the **crisis management system[27] plays a**
significant part in providing national security. This system is formed by the public
administration bodies which establish crisis management centres (which are on twenty-fourhour call) and crisis management teams (advisory expert groups on a communal, district,
provincial and governmental level). Crisis management is the element of the management
system of the national security and consists of prevention of crisis situations, taking control
over them in the manner of planned actions, responding in the event of occurrence of crisis
situations and in reconstructing infrastructure or restoring its original form. On each level of
administration, a plan for crisis management is drawn up. It encompasses the analysis of
threats, the balance of needs, forces and own means and the procedure of receiving external
aid.

Planning and preparation for the event of potential threats and also the appropriate
coordination of the above-mentioned systems forming the national security system are of
essential significance for increasing its efficiency and cohesion, without the necessity to
considerably increase means assigned for provision of national security.

**2.1.1. National Security Management Subsystem**

Managing national security belongs to the most crucial activities of the state aiming at
provision of its existence and development in variable conditions of the security environment.
Adopted in the Constitution of the Republic of Poland, the division of the executive power into
two branches in the state may in some fields potentially generate challenges in efficient
management of national security.

The power issues and related to them difficulties within the scope of managing security may
result from the following conditions:

-  interdependence of constitutional prerogatives of the President of the Republic of

Poland and of the Council of Ministers in the area of national security and their
frequently general nature may bring about various interpretations and sometimes
hinder collaboration of the executive power bodies;

-  the issues of national security are not systemically introduced into competences of

Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate who are constitutionally potential successors of
the President of Republic of Poland should he be not capable of performing his
function;

-  there is an insufficient number of systemic solutions integrating national security.

Established in 2008, the Government Centre for Security[28], due to formal and legal
reasons, cannot be the institution integrating the activity for national security in the
nationwide scale;

27 Structure and functioning of the crisis management system is defined in _the Act of 26 April 2007 on Crisis_
_Management (Journal of Laws, No. 89, item 590, as amended)._
28 _the Act of April 26, 2007 on Crisis Management (Journal of Laws, No. 89, item 590, as amended)._


-----

-  the national security system functions on the basis of the scattered legislation[29];

-  the management of national security is of an interdisciplinary character which

encompasses regulated by the separate rules **crisis management and** **national**
**defence management - however, there are no legal provisions that would unite**
actions taken in both fields of national security into one coherent national security
management system.

_The Act on Crisis Management_ did not unambiguously resolve the crucial issues of
managing national security. First and foremost, it did not precisely indicate the interrelations
occurring between the organisation of the national security management subsystem and the
organisation of management in crisis situations and it did not relate to assignments carried
out outside the territory of the Republic of Poland (participation of civil and military
contingents in missions abroad).

**2.1.2. The Primary Executive Subsystems**

Strategy of National Security of the Republic of Poland defined the executive subsystems of
the national security system[30]. Owing to the indicated in the Introduction specialisation and
complementarity of the integrated development strategies, the interest area of the Strategy of
_Development of the National Security System of the Republic of Poland 2022 was limited to_
three crucial executive subsystems - foreign affairs, national defence and special services.

**A. Foreign Affairs**

Foreign policy is one of the attributes of a state as a sovereign entity in international relations
and constitutes the realisation of its interests on the international arena. The fundamental
objectives of foreign policy are: sovereignty and independence protection and territorial
integrity of the Polish state, provision of civil liberties and citizens' security, establishment of
conditions for sustainable civilisation and economic development of the state, increase of
well-being of the society, creation of a positive image of the state on the international arena,
protection of national heritage, national identity and natural environment. These objectives
are fulfilled in the sphere of foreign relations, on the bilateral and multilateral level.

In pursuit of its foreign policy, Poland aims at forming stable security environment in the
global and regional dimension, strengthening its international position and at levelling and
preventing emergence of crisis situations. Actions of the Republic of Poland on the
international arena reflect values laid at the foundation of the Polish statehood, i.e.
democracy, the rule of law, respecting human rights and solidarity. This target if fulfilled by
shaping friendly surrounding of states and non-state entities. Diplomacy is the tool which
enables a state to express and pursue its foreign policy. It includes, inter alia, legal basis,
organisation, personnel, procedures and methods of operation.

The obligation of the Polish foreign and consular service is to provide all Polish citizens
residing abroad with efficient consular protection. Each day, employees of consulates
embody a gate to Poland, facilitate the resolution of daily difficulties of many thousands of
compatriots as well as of foreigners who intend to come to Poland. To a great extent, the

29 Insufficient proved to be the importance and the scope of the effective legal act of this area - the Regulation of
_the Council of Ministers of April 27, 2007 on the preparation of the system of national security management_
(Journal of Laws, No. 98, item 978).
30 They include: foreign affairs; national defence; special services; public administration and internal affairs;
informatisation and telecommunications; justice; sea economy; budget and public finances; the Treasury;
transport; construction industry; spatial and housing economy; agriculture, development of rural areas and
agricultural markets; health; science and higher education; school system and education; culture and national
heritage protection; environment (including water management); local bodies of government administration and
local government bodies.

image of the state depends upon efficiency and professionalism of work of consuls who for
the majority of foreigners are the first representatives of the Polish state that they meet.

The international position of the state is also reflected in citizens employed in key
international institutions. In the European Union, the general employment of Poles in April
2011 amounted to 2394, including 83 persons on middle and higher executive positions (cf.
Table 3.)

The largest union employer was the European Commission. During this period, the European
Commission was employing 1415 Polish citizens. The newly established European External
Action Service was a place of employment for 54 Polish citizens, including 3 on the executive
level[31]. Pursuant to the data as of the end of 2010, in the NATO International Secretariat
there were employed 23 Polish citizens. Pursuant to the data of November 2010, the total
number of Polish citizens appointed to the United Nations Secretariat amounted to 74.

31 Deputy Secretary General of EEAS and the Heads of the European Union Delegation in Jordan and South
Korea.


-----

Pursuant to the data of the end of December 2011, within the structure of OSCE, there were
employed 84 Polish citizens.

The practice of Polish foreign policy has so far indicated the existence of **institutional**
**memory relating to foreign policy and security policy. The next governments were continuing**
the policy of their predecessors in these two fields. It is an exceptionally crucial feature that
should distinguish foreign policy of a contemporary state under the rule of law.

Analysing efficiency of Polish diplomacy, it ought to be mentioned that thus far it has been
completely fulfilling its role. However, considering the dynamic changes of the security
environment, it should be perceived that global challenges will require increased activity on
behalf of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Although Polish diplomacy is a more and more
efficient service, there is still room for its improvement in such areas as:

-  strengthening of the coordinative role of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs within the
scope of international cooperation pursued by the Sejm, the Senate, other ministries
and by local government as well;

-  improvement of coordination of ministries’ activeness within the scope of cooperation
with their foreign counterparts and at the forum of the EU, NATO and other
international organisations.

The opportunity of Polish foreign policy is to prepare modern, well-motivated and educated
personnel. Carrying out the programme of modernisation of Polish Foreign Service planned
for 2007-2014 ought to become a positive factor. The result of the modernisation will be
creative personnel possessing skills that increase efficiency of implementing Polish priorities
in NATO and the EU and taking care of efficiency of allied mechanisms and also
complementarity of activity of both organisations. The potential of diplomacy of the Republic
of Poland are persons who found employment in international institutions. Their experience
gained during their work for the European Union, the North Atlantic Alliance or the United
Nations cannot be negated. In a similar way one should see the possibility of Polish
diplomats taking positions in the European External Action Service including primarily
positions in the head office of EEAS in Brussels where key decisions concerning European
foreign policy will be arrived at. The adopted by Member States draft decision on establishing
EEAS and its record of close collaboration with diplomacy of Member States enables to treat
the newly formed structure as an actual tool of Polish foreign policy despite the fact that the
service of external actions is most of all to represent interest of the entire EU.

**B. Defence**

Defence is the area of national security constituting the sum of all civilian and military
undertakings aiming at prevention of and opposition to any potential threats of national
security which may result in a political and military crisis. To satisfy defence requirements of
Poland, the national defence system is organised and maintained. Its efficiency is
determined by harmonious collaboration of the management subsystem which forms it and of
the executive subsystems – both military and non-military.

**Polish Armed Forces**

The Polish Armed Forces are an essential element of the national defence system. Their
unique, on the national scale, capabilities decide of the armed forces being a multifunctional
tool to perform broad spectrum of missions including: guaranteeing national defence and
opposing aggression within the scope of allied obligations, participation in stabilising
international situation and supporting internal security and providing assistance to the
society.


-----

The findings of public opinion polls indicate an invariably high level of social approval for
army and high prestige of military service, both of which prove that the Polish Armed Forces
are **one of the most significant institutions of public trust. The strongest advantage of**
the Polish Armed Forces is well-educated personnel and experience gained in foreign
operations, during the service in military structures and as a part of initiatives of NATO and
the EU (the NATO Response Force, EU Battle Groups).

The reforms of the armed forces in recent years have been directed at increasing their
modernity and efficiency. Implementation of the complete professionalization raised the
**professionalisation effort to a higher level[32]. In the first place it imposed upon the alteration**
of principal systems of armed forces - training, feeding, draft, mobilisation, logistics support,
accommodation, armament and military equipment systems. The new model of training was
implemented, recruitment for National Reserve Forces commenced, the proportion of
operation units to support units was altered thus increasing combat potential of the army.
The lowest level of military administration was limited and simplified[33] and the decision of
liquidation of military districts was arrived at.

Also in the financial field positive changes have been observed. The adopted budgets for
2011 and 2012 were the source of the largest so far inflow of financial means for defence. A
high level of capital expenditure indicates the priority treatment of technical modernisation.
Continued are the processes and activities of long-term consequences for functioning and
development of the Polish Armed Forces: gradual reducing of the contingent in Afghanistan,
continuation of the informatisation strategy of the Ministry of National Defence,
implementation of the performance budget and further economisation of functioning of the
Ministry of National Defence and of the armed forces, disposing of the infrastructure which is
unnecessary for the army[34].

In 2011-2012, the technical modernisation priorities of the Polish Armed Forces were
**identified and focused on** development of air defence, mobility of armed forces, information
and unmanned systems. The strategic decision was made to **increase investments in**
**Polish defence industry and the research sector related to it. This characteristic**
'Polonisation' of the industrial defence potential ought to become a pro-development action
intensifying competitiveness and innovation of the domestic defence industry and its export
capabilities and in consequence providing new workplaces. The works on a fundamental
change of command and control structures on the central level commenced. They implement
the idea of jointness into the command and control system of the Polish Armed Forces. The
key decision was made to reform **uniform pensions and extend appropriate rights to**
**veterans of operations abroad.** The commitment concerning **the stability of long-term**
**financing of the national defence requirements was maintained.**

Requirements of the contemporary security environment, technological development and
advancing modernisation of armed forces of neighbouring states and member states of
NATO reveal increasing challenges in functioning of the Polish Armed Forces, to a great
extent brought about by the insufficient quantity of modern armament and military
equipment. Despite the fact of consolidating the systems of acquisition, utilisation and
withdrawing of armament and military equipment of the Polish Armed Forces, the pace of
supplies of new types of armament is frequently too slow due to capabilities of suppliers and

the necessity of balanced, parallel financing of armament supplies in many areas. Both the
system of training personnel reserves of the Polish army and the structure of commanding it
require improvement. Allied obligations and social expectations also put a transformational
pressure on the Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland. This pressure concerns the
accelerated development of operational capabilities and increasing the proportion of combat
units to support units.

The participation in international defence programmes, including European Defence Agency
(EDA), offers opportunities to strengthen the Polish Armed Forces. Also intensified presence
of the allied defence infrastructure on the territory of Poland will increase the interoperability
of our forces. Outsourcing in the selected areas of functioning of the army (e.g. logistics
support, command support) will enable to lower the costs of its operating and will enable its
further professionalisation. The Smart Defence[35]and Pooling & Sharing[36] initiatives which are
being implemented within the scope of NATO and the EU are the opportunity for further
development of defence capabilities of Poland and its allies. Their objective is to maintain
and strengthen defence capabilities together with improvement of their efficiency,
interoperability and cost effectiveness.

The potential threat to the development of the Polish Armed Forces would be depriving their
development and technical modernisation programme of stability of long-term financing,
which would discredit the opportunity to eliminate deficiencies in operational capabilities.
Close completion of armament and military equipment’s life cycle may considerably widen
the existing gaps. Low social interest in situation of army, decreasing armed forces
competitiveness on the labour market and a lack of social acceptance for the Polish Armed
Forces participation in military operations abroad may turn out to be the dangerous
phenomena.

**Administrative Structures**

The public administration carries out assignments providing efficient and safe functioning of
the state in conditions of external threat to national security and in time of war, establishing
conditions of protection and survival of citizens, supplying the Polish Armed Forces and units
responsible for internal security with human and material resources and also assignments
resulting from the host nation obligations.

The strong point of the defence preparations which are conducted by the public
administration are legal and organisational solutions. Operational planning which enables
functioning of administrative structures in conditions of external threat to national security
and in time of war encompasses all levels of public administration and selected institutions of
the state administration (approximately 3000 entities). The defence training system and the
control system of carrying out defence assignments functions relatively well.

Civil defence is a noticeable drawback in this area. Sustained for years, the lack of legal and
systemic solutions regulating the cooperation of rescue systems, bodies and services
performing tasks of protecting population impairs the preparations both in the field of national
defence and crisis management. A small amount of national and regional defence training,
directed at collaboration of civil and military elements, is also worrying. Challenges arise
from a low level of defence competences in the society which results from insufficient
education in the defence area, the lack of tools assessing these competences and modern
means of education.

Considering the nature of contemporary and future operations requiring the comprehensive
approach and taking into account protraction of the post-conflict phase, the role of nonmilitary instruments and civil component in military operations is increasing. Poland
possesses the low percentage of civil experts participating in crisis response operations
abroad. The lack of formalised and standardised process of planning, preparation and
participation of ministries other than the MOD and civilian employees in military operations
prevents the comprehensive and coordinated use of government and non-government
resources. The opportunity to improve this state of affairs will be to prepare and implement
rules and procedures of involvement of civil departments and participation of civilian
personnel.

**Economic structures**

Strengthening of the state's capacity for defence, including provision of population survival,
functioning of the state's structures and its armed forces, requires considerable involvement
of its economic structures forming the industrial defence potential [37] and carrying out the
economic and defence assignments.

Polish potential, which enables production of the definite armament and military equipment
systems, constitutes one of the determinants of the state's sovereignty and mobilisation
readiness of its structures. Domestic industry remains the key supply source of armament
and military equipment for the Polish Armed Forces and Polish research and development
centres are the important suppliers of technology and technical ideas within the scope of
defence technologies. The interest of Polish economy (technological progress, workplaces,

37 The industrial defence potential is defined in the regulation of the Council of Ministers of October 4, 2010 on the
_register of companies, state-owned enterprises and research and development units conducting activity for_
_national security and defence, and of companies pursuing international trade of goods, technologies and services_
_of a strategic significance for national security and maintaining international peace and security (Journal_ of Laws,
No. 198, item 1313).


-----

trade with foreign partners, supporting the state's budget with incomes from taxes and fees)
also appeals to maintaining and supporting the industrial defence potential. [38].

Completing the structure transformation process of the sector[39], increasing expenditure on
research and development works relating to national security and defence, consolidation of
the R&D resources and more effective support and promotion of the sector will significantly
affect the market position of the Polish industrial defence potential (ppo).

The conditions resulting from forming common European defence market require that
integration of Polish scientific and industrial potential will be **directed at the states of**
**European Union and NATO. The works of the European Defence Agency exert the**
strongest influence on actions within the scope of EU cooperation in the area of defence
market and industry[40]. Its activity contributes to competitiveness development on the
European Defence Market and in the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base.
On the way to effective inclusion of industrial defence potential in European collaboration,
there are the following obstacles: economic barriers (and in some events also technological
ones) limiting its abilities to integrate its technological capabilities with leading potentates of
armaments industry of the European countries, a lack of strong representation of Polish
armaments industry on markets, political and voluntary character of tools prevailing in the EU
and difficulties in gaining consensus.

Within the scope of cooperation with NATO, Poland participates in carrying out multinational
programmes of the considerable significance for strengthening its defence potential and
participates in works of allied institutions responsible for acquiring modern equipment and
armament. Active participation in functioning of these assemblies gives an opportunity to
include the defence potential of our state in the armament system of the Alliance (the system
is being collectively established). The participation also offers possibility to enter into
cooperation or into shared programmes with other manufacturers. The more effective use by
the national economic entities of the aforementioned areas of collaboration within the scope
of NATO is necessary.

The significant element of the industrial defence potential is the resource base responsible
**for research and development. Coming into force of** _the Act of April 30, 2010_
_on the Principles of Financing Science[41]and_ _of the Act of April 30, 2010 on the National_
_Research and Development Centre[42], significantly affected the research in the defence_
sector. New challenges were set for the military research institutes (WIB)[43], related to more
and more frequent participation in research in which many entities are involved. It ought to be
aimed at tightening cooperation between research institutes, optimally using their abilities to
increase capacity to compete on European and global market. In this context the works
undertaken in Ministry of Defence on consolidation of the research and development base,
adapted for current and perspective requirements of the Polish Armed Forces, were well

grounded. It is also indispensable to carry out the assignment consolidation of the sector and
most of all to establish following foreign solutions, the national capital group of the
armaments industry in which proprietary rights should be exercised by the Treasury.

The significant impulse for improvement and streamlining of acquisition, utilisation and
withdrawal of armament and military equipment was appointment of the Armaments Council
as of the advisory body of the Ministry of Defence[44]. Equally crucial was the appointment of
the National Armaments Director within the scope of international collaboration with NATO,
the EU, countries and other international organisations in the field of armament, military
equipment, research and development works for defence[45].

The considerable development potential is present in the transfer of innovative technologies
between the military and civil sectors. This is a two-way flow, although in Polish conditions
the technology transfer from the civil sector to the military one dominates. Although the
system of financing research and development adopted in Poland works and implementation
works for the Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland are conducive to flow of knowledge to
the civil sector[46], barriers of the legal,, organisational and cultural nature significantly limit the
spectrum of possibilities of military technologies flow to the civil sector.

The economic structures participate in carrying out undertakings within the scope of national
defence preparations which aim at provision of material basis for performance of defence
tasks and population survival[47].

**C. Special services**
The characteristics of Polish security environment, as well as the comprehensive nature of
contemporary challenges and threats result in special services playing a very significant part
in realisation of national interests. Their elemental mission is to provide the state bodies
responsible for national security with comprehensive, credible and leading information
support. In the interest of these services remains information which may be significant for
security and international position of Poland and its economic and defence potential. Their
activities are mainly related to fighting against international terrorism, organised crime,
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and means of their delivery, counterintelligence
protection, national economic security and secret information protection. The important
assignment of special services remains the security of Polish civil-military contingents taking
part in operations abroad. Considering the advancing process of security globalisation and
also the obligations resulting from membership of the Republic of Poland in NATO and the
EU, special services must extend their ability to recognise situations in the regions of
international tensions, conflicts and crises in the world.

47 The fundamental areas of defence preparations carried out with economic entities include: mobilisation of
economy (maintaining production and repair capacity indispensable for carrying out the assignments included in
the Economy Mobilisation Programme - PMG); militarisation; protection of objects particularly important to
national security and defence; preparation, use and protection of transportation for national defence needs;
preparation and use of public and non-public health service for national defence needs; preparation and use of
communication systems for national defence needs; supplying civil defence with equipment, materials and
resources; reconstruction of damaged infrastructure; distribution of medicinal products, medical devices and food;
supplying population with food, water, energy carriers, medicine, means of protection and hygiene; supervision of
economic potential within the scope of industry, agriculture, communication, transportation, power industry,
forestry and health protection.


-----

Increasing efficiency of special services’ activity requires effective cooperation with different
bodies and national services and participation in international intelligence and
counterintelligence collaboration. Selection and training of officers ought to, above all, be
based on provision of high quality personnel that is able to quickly and individually analyse
an event, including crisis situations, and draw up information, facilitating in such a manner
realisation of national interests of the Republic of Poland by national bodies. Appropriate
equipping and financing also influences efficiency of Polish intelligence agencies in operating
environment.

Particular attention in the functioning of intelligence agencies should be paid to the aspect of
cyber-attack threats which may result in granting unauthorised entities (including foreign
intelligence agencies or criminal and terrorist groups) access to classified information stored
in electronic form and may also pose a threat of disorganisation to the most crucial
information systems of government and public institutions and of spheres of public sector of
great economic significance.

**2.1.3 Development of resilience against threats to national security**
Aside from the executive subsystems, the important part in provision of national security is
played by the national security support systems. These include, inter alia, critical
infrastructure protection and the system of strategic reserves.

**A. Critical infrastructure protection**

Critical infrastructure protection is beginning to gain a dimension of national security and
access to key services remains the measurable aspect of national security and the state's
obligation to citizens[48].

The issue of protecting critical infrastructure took on an international dimension as well. Both
the European Union and NATO are attempting to find solutions which may help Member
States to strengthen the level of this protection. The 2008/114/WE Directive of December 8,
2008 on the identification and designation of European critical infrastructures and the
assessment of the need to improve their protection[49] define the European Critical
Infrastructure as the infrastructure which disruption of functioning may affect at least two
Member States. Currently the European Critical Infrastructure is selected in two sectors:
energy and transport, whereas NATO focuses on drawing up protection standards of energy
critical infrastructure, treating this field as a key to support possible military activity of the
Alliance.

In the past, the elements forming the critical infrastructure functioned as independent or only
partially dependent systems. At present, in the age of advancing globalisation and
technological development, the individual objects of critical infrastructure are more and more
interdependent not only in the dimension of one state but on the regional, European and
even world scale. The progress, apart from obvious benefits, brought about the increase of
their sensitivity to potential threats including threats of new type - related to cyberspace.

For the critical infrastructure protection to be effective, it should constitute the common effort
of both government administration, as well as operators and owners. Therefore, the critical
infrastructure protection must be the assignment of its owner or operator, whereas the role of

48 Art. 3, item 2 of _the Act of 26 April 2007 on Crisis Management_ (Journal of Laws, No. 89, item 590, as
amended) defines the critical infrastructures as systems which include in them functional objects interrelated with
themselves, encompassing construction objects, devices, installations, key services for security of the state
and its citizens and for provision of efficient functioning of public administration bodies,

and also of institutions and entrepreneurs.
49 O. J. EU of 2008, No. 345, p. 75.


-----

the state is limited to coordinating and supervising its function. Interventions are permitted in
the event of a given element of critical infrastructure not being sufficiently protected or when
liquidation of results of a crisis situation exceeds capacity of a given owner or operator.

The key document drawn up for the critical infrastructure protection system will be _the_
_National Critical Infrastructure Protection Programme. Also, integration of civil and military_
solutions in the area of critical infrastructure protection will strengthen the critical
infrastructure protection. Increased awareness of significance of critical infrastructure
security aspects for national security amongst its operators and public administration
constitutes crucial opportunity for providing national security.

**B. System of strategic reserves**

The fundamental aspect of correct functioning of the state and its economy, providing
essential living necessities in time of disturbances of key goods' and products' supplies,
is to possess the efficient system of strategic reserves. Existing of a competent, transparent
and rational system of reserves supports carrying out of the assignments in the field of
national security and defence, public order and health and of natural disasters or crisis
situations. It supports reconstruction of critical infrastructure, eases disruptions in continuity
of supplies used for functioning of economy and meet fundamental necessities of citizens,
saving their lives and health and protecting fulfilment of international obligations of the
Republic of Poland.

The weak part of the system of national reserves is the lack of precise legal foundations
standardising the issue of liquidation of the reserves which could no longer be supported and
the protracting procedure of releasing the assortment maintained under the restricted
conditions which conduced towards the possibility of selling these products. The system of
reserves which is being created after adopting the _Act on Strategic Reserves[50] corresponds_
with international and macroeconomic conditions of Poland as a member of the European
Union and NATO. It takes into consideration alterations of the state's security environment
conditions, is capable of responding to changing economic situation and contributes to
efficient maintaining, distributing and reconstructing of reserves. Bringing into effect of new
legal regulations in the area of strategic reserves will enable to reduce bureaucratic
difficulties relating to forming, liquidating and rendering available procedures and will permit
to precisely define assignment of individual departments of government administration and
entrepreneurs of this field. In prospect, a modern, clear and rational system will be
established. Its essential element will be _the_ _Governmental Programme of Strategic_
_Reserves[51]._

**2.2. Integration between public policies and the security policy**

**A. Integration of socio-economic development and national security[52]**

Activities from the area of national security and socio-economic development, in spite of their
relative autonomy, are connected by the network of shared interrelations. Functioning of

50 _The Act of 29 October 2010 on Strategic Reserves (Journal_ of Laws, No. 229, item 1496, as amended).
51 The project of the Governmental Programme of Strategic Reserves is drawn up by the minister competent for

economy in collaboration with the Minister of National Defence, the minister competent for internal affairs, the
minister competent for agriculture, the minister competent for agricultural markets, the minister competent for
justice, the minister competent for transport, the minister competent for health, Head of the Internal Security
Agency and with other bodies of government administration carrying out assignments within the scope of
national security and defence, crisis management and critical infrastructure protection and of public security,
order and health.

52 The fields presented in this part of the strategy are analysed only in the context of relations

with national security and especially - defence. Different aspects of functioning of these fields are analysed in
the 8 remaining integrated development strategies.


-----

bodies and services responsible for national security influences the labour market, industry
and services, education, natural environment, infrastructure development and the spatial
structure of the state. Pursuing to strengthen socio-economic and territorial cohesion will be
improving inner strength of the state and foundations of national security.
**Regional development**
Military institutions may be one of the factors dynamising regional and local development. As
they appear in the role of an employer, tax payer, party ordering products and party providing
services within the scope of security.

Of the considerable significance for local communities is the army's ability to carry out
assignments related to supporting the state's bodies in providing internal security and to
assist institutions, government and self-government services with military aid and to assist
society with responding to threats (natural and technical disasters). Localisation of the
military unit in a given area strengthens sense of security of its residents, owing to forces
ready to be of help to population in life-threatening situations and in health and property
emergencies. Although presence of military complexes does not significantly influence
individual regions, in the economic sphere the army affects diversity of the local labour
market, stabilising demand and increase of local budget revenues from the property tax.
Collaboration of the army with schools is of great importance. As a result, patriotic attitudes
and values in young generation are formed[53].

On the other hand, the reform of the Polish army carried out in recent years resulted in the
reduction of army and of military entities' number. Although the alterations in dislocation of
the units are rightly dictated by most of all national defence necessities and the necessity to
rationalise all public expenses, in their aftermath, definite, frequently negative consequences
for economies and communities, communes and districts appeared.

Activity of the defence sector may also have a negative influence on regional development
resulting from the necessity of introducing specific limitations in the areas neighbouring on
military objects[54]. Just like military complexes may restrict development and use of terrains
surrounding them, the regional development may also force limitations of development and
use of military areas. Therefore, there is a need for cooperation directed at minimising of
potential conflicts. Good collaboration between military units and local government may be
the source of mutual benefits. Analogically, its lack especially in the field of development
planning and coordination of current activity may bring about measurable damages.

**Planning and spatial development**

To provide national security and defence, the spatial policy must establish conditions to
respect national defence and security requirements in all planning preparations within the
scope of spatial development on the national, provincial and local level. The effect of
pursuing the spatial policy should be, inter alia, the efficient and safe functioning of the
armed forces as well as of institutions operating in the internal security sphere of the state.
Simultaneously, the policy ought to use features of the areas of defence and national security
for purposes of regional development.

_rozwoju lokalnego i regionalnego, Zeszyty Naukowe – the quarterly journal of National Defence Academy No._
4(81), Warsaw 2010, p. 261, 270-271.
54 The example of such a negative influence may be the location of the Missile Defence Base that
will perhaps influence the economic zone neighbouring with the base (e.g. restrictions of height
of buildings in the zone).


-----

The serious issue in this area is the little interest of self-governments to carry out local plans
of spatial development of areas neighbouring on army restricted areas. Due to the lack of
appropriate legal means mobilising self-government authorities to carry out these plans, the
matters of establishing protection zones for restricted areas requiring them, are being
protracted. It limits the opportunity to undertake planning activities by military property
administrators and results in spatial conflicts related to functioning of military complexes.

**Infrastructure development**

Development of infrastructure and development of defence sector are mutually coupled. On
one hand, construction of the modern transportation system, of public roads in particular,
modernisation of railways, airports and inland waterways connected with introduction of
modern transport means, constitutes one of the key fields in the defence preparations
system and in national crisis management. It will contribute also to providing population with
livelihoods, including ability to evacuate it, and to becoming an essential element of
supporting the Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland and the allied forces in the event of
crisis or an armed conflict. On the other hand, infrastructure development of the security
sector affects development of infrastructure in the regions of functioning of this sector's
objects. If possible, the spatial policy ought to strive in these areas for shared use of
infrastructure both for defence and national security purposes and for regional development
(co-use of military airports, sport facilities, common environmental investments, e.g.
wastewater treatment plants).

To the available extent, military aviation uses the existing civil airports of public use or hands
over the selected own airports for co-using. Also sport and recreational facilities of the
defence sector are rendered available for the interested, taking into consideration present
needs of a current user on the basis of binding regulations.

**Environment protection**

The entities responsible for providing national external security undertake to abide and carry
out assignments and obligations resulting from the national legal regulations relating to
natural environment protection. As the structures carrying out assignments on the whole
state territory, they play, within this scope, the significant part, both as direct environment
users and as an actual force capable of undertaking pro-ecology actions on the local level. It
succeeds also through raising environmental awareness of the military personnel.

Environment condition of the areas managed by the armed forces is mainly affected by:

-  installations and devices of technical infrastructure, including used solid fuel boiler
rooms, wastewater treatment plants in poor technical condition, outdated warehouses
and petrol stations;

-  waste, including inappropriate hazardous waste management ;

-  sources of electromagnetic radiation and sources of noise;

-  environment pollution resulting from the character and purpose of the armed forces.

For several years, the environment condition in the areas used by the Ministry of National
Defence has been systematically improving. A great quantity of military areas possess high
ecological and natural value and the established method of utilising space resulted in
creation of specific habitats (including ones for rare and endangered species) on military
training areas. Military training areas are often recognised as areas of little intensification of
economic activity, high level of preserved natural value and of hampered access for civil
population. As a result, the Polish Armed Forces are one of the entities occupying the
highest percentage of land area in the borders of European Ecological Network Natura


-----

2000[55]. In many cases, the presence of the army in the areas of high ecological and natural
value, not only preserved them but also provided with good conditions for development.

**Counteracting unemployment**

To increase attractiveness of the military service and to provide the appropriate support for
professional soldiers in the process of returning to the civil labour market after their service
termination, the personnel reconversion system functions within the Ministry of National
Defence. Authorised for the reconversion aid are all professional soldiers (with few
exceptions) and also in particular cases - members of their families. The system uses
gradation of financial means allotted to improve or change professional qualifications aiming
at encouraging to remain in the military service. The gradation also enables optimal
preparation to take up employment after being released from the armed forces. Thanks to
that, the possibility of efficient levelling of the risk of personnel professional inactivity and of
counteracting negative effects of unemployment was gained.

The reconversion aid system encompasses, inter alia, activity within the scope of career
counselling and employment services, retraining and apprenticeships and also information
and advisory trainings conducted for individuals and groups. In addition, the structures of
personnel reconversion in cooperation with different labour market entities undertake actions
aimed at including soldiers, members of their families and also army employees into training
programmes financed by the EU, aiming at improving professional qualifications.

**Education and higher education**

Military schools constitute the didactic and R&D back-up facilities for the area of national
security and defence. They train labour force within the army, defence industry and in the
public administration sector - government and self-government. In the military education
system, there are five **military schools, i.e. public schools supervised by the Minister of**
National Defence[56].

Since 2005 military schools are the rightful members of the common higher education
system in Poland and their activity is subjugated by the regulations of training conduct,
professional development and scientific research, compulsory to other schools, pursuant to
assumptions of Bologna Process[57]. This activity is however in the first place subjugated and
adopted for the needs of the Polish Armed Forces, while such needs are being modified due
to the process of transformation. The transformation of military schools, conducted in recent
years, indicated the impossibility of basing the recruitment of officer corps only on graduates
of civil schools. It also confirmed that the military schools are an irreplaceable source of
personnel for first service positions in the officer corps[58.] Military schools have considerably
improved, including themselves in the national education system. They have improved
fundamental employment indicators which, taking into account specificity of military schools
activity, do not differ from the national average. The presence of civil students in military
schools (they constitute almost 90% of all students) decides that military schools are
effective and are able to maintain their potential and establish personnel, inter alia, for the
National Reserve Forces.

55 It is estimated that 50% of military training areas are included in the Natura 2000 network.
56 Academy of National Defence, Military University of Technology, Naval Academy, Military Academy of Land
Forces, Polish Air Force Academy. The soldier training is also supported by the Medical University of  Łódź.
57 The schools were operating within the higher military education system, which was separate from the civil
system and based on the Act of 31 March 1965 on Higher Military Education (Journal of Laws of 1992, No. 10,
item 40, as amended.), repealed in 2005.
58 he complete resignation from educating candidates for officers at Medical University of Łódź brought about
serious shortages of personnel in military health care, amounting to hundreds of vacancies. The similar situation
took place in the field of logistics services.


-----

During the reorganisation of the military education system, new assignments were defined
for integrated **non-commissioned officers’ schools** and regulations of recruitment of
candidates for the aforementioned schools. Preparation of non-commissioned officer
personnel for the needs of the Polish Armed Forces is carried out on the basis of the noncommissioned officers’ schools and by specialist centres in armed forces services and in
components.

**National heritage protection and development of cultural infrastructure**

The essential element of shaping national identity is to popularise tradition and history of the
Polish military. The need to popularise the idea of defence in the context of
professionalisation of the Polish Armed Forces and intensified interest in the history of Polish
arms as well as in modern combat forces justify the necessity to implement systemic
solutions related to functioning of military museums. It encompasses museums of the status
of a national institution of culture[59] and also numerous tradition halls being parts of military
units. The essential obstacle to perform their function is the lack of appropriate infrastructure
and consolidation of these units within one common programme of acquiring, maintaining
and rendering available monuments of national culture related to history of the Polish army.
The improvement of such condition will be achieved through stock-taking of dispersed
collections and handing over of the most valuable exhibits for record of military museums national institutions of culture. It will provide them with legal protection and financial means
for conservation and maintenance.

**B. Social base for national security**

**Social perception of national security**

The progressing openness of Polish society and increasing influence of public opinion on
political decisions require more and more effective social communication, efficiently
presenting objectives of the Polish security policy. It is indispensable to acquire social
understanding of these objectives and relatively high level of acceptance for them. The
significant assignment is also to generate social capital based on the high level of citizen
activity, social trust and shared national identity.

Security. Majority of Polish people regard Poland to be a safe state - both in the international
and internal dimensions. More than a half positively assess the situation of Poland on the
international arena (57%), and the unquestionable majority thinks that the independence of
our country is not threatened (73%)[60]. To a large extent, these evaluations are dependent on
Polish relations with its largest neighbours - Russia, Germany and Ukraine. The majority of
Polish people think that friendly and partner relations with these states are possible[61].

The Security policy. Despite the high sense of security and positive evaluation of Poland in
the world, Polish people think that our state does not sufficiently take care of its interests in
relations with other countries[62]. The worries regarding the Russian policy of intensifying its
power and influence in the world have increased and a larger group of Polish people values
more friendly relations with Russia than a close collaboration of states of the old CCCP[63].
Against the popular opinion of pro-American position of Polish people, Polish support for the

US and the policy of current Administration is considerably lower than the average in
European states of NATO[64]. The international organisation of the highest level of trust of
Polish people is the European Union[65] - 86% of Polish people support the European
integration and 65% think that it will provide Poland with more benefits than costs.[66]. Despite
the little knowledge of the EU institutions, their image in Poland is positive and their
recognition - quite common[67]. The significant approval for Polish membership in NATO (80%)
may be collided with the sceptical evaluation of usefulness of the Alliance - only 51% of
Polish people think that NATO is still needed and this number constitutes one of the lowest
levels of support amongst all member states of the Alliance[68]. Even more negative position is
presented by Polish people on military operations conducted by NATO in Afghanistan - 79%
defies the participation of Polish soldiers in this operation.[69] The case of Afghan mission is
not secluded - majority of the Polish society is generally negative towards military
involvement of Poland in international military missions and assess them as too large in
proportion to economic capacity and financial abilities of our state[70].

The Polish Armed Forces. The Polish Army is invariably one of the leading institutions of
public trust. The considerable majority of Polish people trust army and positively assess its
activity (70%) - the army collects better opinions than different non-political public
institutions.[71] Simultaneously only one third of Polish people (30%) is interested in the
situation of the Polish Armed Forces. Polish people perceive the army also as the
underinvested institution in terms of general and technical equipment (76%) and they think
that the Government should not seek savings in the defence sphere.

**Role of non-governmental organisations in providing national security**

The non-governmental organisations, including social emergency rescue organisations [72] are
a very significant entity of the contemporary national security system, more specifically - of
common security. On one hand, they function in the structures of the state as legal units
which are independent and autonomous, on the other - the state entrusts them specific tasks
to be fulfilled which without their aid might not be efficiently performed. In some fields of
social life, the non-governmental organisations play a crucial part, adopting the obligation of
public authorities to provide security to citizens. Social emergency rescue specialists are
trained and prepared to provide fast and professional help, in particular in adverse
conditions, where services supposed to provide help are not capable of responding as
effectively. The specific location of social organisations in the Polish legal order provides
them with possibility to earn a living and acquire financial means for current activity. The
state, appreciating significance of the organisations for efficient functioning of voluntary
rescue, order individual organisations to perform specified tasks, allotting for this objective
funds from the state's budget. In addition, social rescue organisations, taking into

consideration their capacity of powers and means, level of rescuers' training, as well as
possessing professional rescue equipment, are included in the provincial plans of crisis
management as indispensable elements supporting actions of different services.

Also, strengthening of the national capability for defence requires close cooperation with nongovernmental organisations and other social partners. It ought to be used for activation of
society in the field of defence and construction of social back-up facilities for the Polish
Armed Forces. Cooperation with non-governmental organisations conducting activities for
defence possesses good legal and organisational instrumentation. The positive phenomenon
observed in recent years is the increasing engagement and activity growth in nongovernmental organisations in the sphere of defence and activity of the armed forces. Visible
is also the development of collaboration between non-governmental organisations and
individual military units. It is necessary for the armed forces to have greater recognition of
potential of the organisations and treating them as partners in carrying out shared defence
assignments. The other barrier affecting development of national capability for defence is the
modest analytical potential for defence, which results in a little flow of knowledge to the
defence sector. The reason for this situation is the little number of think tanks specialised in
defence issues and perceiving the defence subject as hermetic.

## II. Challenges, development trends and development vision of the
 national security system of the Republic of Poland

In second decade of 21[st] century, national security will be formed by the dynamic process of
risk identification, meeting challenges, defining goals and methods of their performance. New
security quality shall be manifested in the following aspects: flow of information (availability of
information influences society pressure to carry out appropriate assignments), asymmetry (in
choosing forces and means), networking (international and national security organisations
network), integration (advancing integration of civil-military efforts). Complex and
multifaceted security of Poland - state as an institution and its citizens - requires close
integration of its basic areas as follows: external and political security, military security,
economic security, social and ecological security and others. Moreover, national security
shall be related with economic and social development of the state. This approach fulfils
philosophy of documentation developed within the scope of integrated development
strategies.

Key factors shaping national security of the Republic of Poland are the following: the security
policy, internal and external conditions, modern challenges and threats, national security
system development.

**Challenges and development trends**

In the last decade, the Polish security policy evolved systematically and extended the
significance of security within subjective and objective scope, to transform steadily into the
concept of integrated national security. This approach to national security is the condition of
national development and simultaneously is its initial element. Objectives of the security
policy evolved to a lesser degree, since they are directed at performance of national
interests.

Key international conditions supporting security of Poland are memberships in NATO and the
EU. Participation in NATO continues to provide allied guarantees for defence of national
territory, which reinforces external security through the use of political and military means.
Moreover, the EU membership creates opportunities for permanent, versatile and
sustainable development and provides opportunity to strengthen international position, as
well as to increase international influence of Poland.

In perspective of strategy appliance, the probability of a conventional armed attack against
Poland is rather low. Yet, it cannot be completely excluded that situation of military threat or
use of military forces might occur. Regarding proximity of significant military potentials to
Poland, including non-conventional capacities, our country shall sustain capabilities enabling
effective reaction to such threats. This approach is supported by the appointed in the longterm strategy for national development (LNDS) limited predictability of security environment
development in a longer time perspective.

Key conditions increasing risk of conflicts that affect national security of Poland and as
appointed in LNDS, are many hot spots worldwide as well as ‘frozen’ conflicts. As potential
risk sources, including military threats, remain regions of lower stability within Euro Atlantic
area or in its proximity, especially the Middle East, Caucasus, Middle Asia and
Mediterranean. Although the accompanying threat of military conflicts remains low and
should not involve a direct threat to the security of Poland, it might be the source of risk for
our allies which will require to be neutralised with the use of our armed forces.

In the future, as well as nowadays, the most significant risk to the security of Poland, its allies
and international stability as a whole, is proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and
means of their delivery. However, in nearest future this shall not cause direct risks for the
territory and citizens of Poland. Yet, in the perspective of strategy appliance, it might weaken
international non-proliferation regimes and weapon control as well as destabilise international
situation in some regions.


-----

International terrorism will remain a threat to Polish security. The risk of terrorist attacks
directed onto the territory of Poland may increase in the future, due to international activity of
our state, especially one arising from our obligations towards our allies. This denotes a
necessity of participation of our state, within the scope of Polish needs and capabilities, in
the international war on terror.

The crucial challenge for national security will be activity of organised criminal groups,
especially transnational ones. This phenomenon will increase together with popularity of
Poland among such groups, because of the state’s transit location, development of
European integration, open borders and increase of citizens’ wealth.

In the nearest future, the challenge for the Polish security policy will be diversification of
energy sources, their suppliers and transmission channels, as well as increasing of state
resilience to crisis situations.

Another challenge for national security remains the possibility of crisis situation occurring as
a consequence of natural disasters, human activity or of various global processes and
phenomena. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain the highest level of response capability for
such kind of occurrences, fast minimisation of their consequences, as well as their
prevention, if only possible. It is particularly significant to provide appropriate resilience of
critical infrastructure to crisis situations.

The particular challenge for security of Poland, similarly to other highly developed countries
including our allies and partners, will be the negative activity in cyberspace resulting either
from wilful intent or inadvertent actions, brought about by malfunction or mishap causing
interference of data communication networks.

**Vision of development of the integrated national security system**

The ability of the state to take up challenges and to prevent risks including political, military
and socio-economic threats shall be more strictly connected with socio-economic
development of the state. This development will condition improvement of organisational
efficiency of the state and delivery of resources and instruments to eliminate emerging risks.

Contemporary challenges and risks oblige to take long-term, expedient and preventive
measures within the scope of national security. It is necessary to develop appropriate
institutionalised mechanisms of actions which in the event of a direct threat will be effective,
as well as to take measures minimising probability of occurrence of unwanted events. The
objective of the national security system is to oppose in an integrated manner all national
security risks, to undertake challenges and reduce risks with use of all national resources.

Forecasting development of the national security system in the mid-term perspective, it ought
to be assumed that the system will be based on complex allied and bilateral security systems
synergistically connected with its own,. gradually developed civil-military potential. All the
aforementioned solutions shall be connected with socio-economic development and
therefore form the integrated national security system. It shall be still developed based on
two key elements: the national defence system **and the** **crisis management system.**

The idea of national security system development assumes that this system is based on
hitherto model and consists of internally coordinated management and executive subsystems
which are joint together by the goal of the mission carried out by them, which is providing
national security.

The organisational structure of the national security management subsystem, established
as a result of the combination of functional management with the actual structure of
executive authority, will form a model of security management. In this model, function of the
superior, political decisive entity is fulfilled by the President of the Republic of Poland
together with the Council of Ministers, whose forum of political arrangements will be the


-----

Cabinet Council[73]. The function of advisory body to the President of the Republic of Poland
shall be served by the National Security Council[74] and the staff advisory body will be the
National Security Bureau[75]. National security management ought to be performed at all levels
of public administration: central, provincial, district, communal, emphasising unity and
efficiency of actions. The subsystem of national security management includes commanding
bodies of the Polish Armed Forces with the Commander-in-chief in the event of him being
appointed. The element of national security management is and will remain crisis
management, understood as an activity of public administration bodies which consists of
preventing crisis situations, preparations to take control over them through planned
undertakings, responding in the event of occurrence of a crisis situation, eliminating their
results and of restoring resources and critical infrastructure.

The **executive subsystems of the national security system will be constituted mainly by**
national forces and means specialised in the field of security, such as: diplomacy, armed
forces, special forces and resources of security support. Among those, the leading role in
achieving objectives shall be fulfilled by diplomacy and the Polish Armed Forces.

The acceptance to perform the catalogue of the Polish **foreign policy priorities shall**
introduce to the policy strategic and operational thinking. In its development, the significant
part will be played by analytic centres. The Polish foreign policy ought to be directed to
various scopes of regional and global cooperation. The Republic of Poland will be a country
with a considerable influence on development of new solutions and performance of the
eastern policy of the European Union and of the European Neighbourhood Policy. Goals of
the policy will be constituted by an active support for states undergoing political
transformation and initiation of new forms of cooperation[76].

In long-term perspective, Poland will possess **efficient, mobile and inter-operational**
**Polish Armed Forces which will systemically and proactively adapt their operational**
capabilities to the changes in the security environment. This will be performed through
researching and introducing innovative changes and applying acquired knowledge and
lessons learned[77]. he priority of the Polish Armed Forces’ transformation in the strategy
horizon will be improving the level of their operational capabilities and maintaining potential
prepared to respond to current, new and unpredictable risks. The crucial element of
preparations of the Polish Armed Forces to prevent modern threats will be increasing level of
military and general training of soldiers. Until 2022, consolidation of higher military education
and improvement of quality of didactic and scientific and research process in military schools
will be achieved. This shall consider effective expenditure of public funds. Organisation of
tactical components that achieve quick readiness to develop and act in variable combat
environment will increase operational capabilities of the Polish Armed Forces. In this
situation, it is significant to provide security for the troops in Polish military contingents.

To fulfil the aforementioned challenges, the armed forces should possess operational
capabilities to act autonomously in any combat environment. The principal determinant of
operational requirements is possession of weapons and military equipment capable of
detecting, identifying, tracking and destroying means of adversary. Achieving of estimated
operational abilities through providing (optimal) conditions to survive in the battlefield
requires the systemic approach reflected in five main systems: command and control,

73 Constitution of the Republic of Poland, Art. 141, section 1 ''In matters of particular importance the President of
the Republic of Poland is entitled to summit the Cabinet Council. The Cabinet Council is formed by the Council of
Ministers debating headed by the President of the Republic of Poland''.
74Ibidem, art. 135.,,The advisory body of the President of the Republic of Poland within the scope of internal and
external national security is the National Security Council”[.]
75 The Act on Common Duty to Defend the Republic of Poland, Art. 11, section 1 states ''The President of
Republic of Poland performs tasks within the scope of security and defence with support of the National Security
Bureau''.

reconnaissance, engagement, survival and protection of the army and logistics support of
undertakings.
Technical modernisation of the Polish army shall be based on extended cooperation with
**national defence industry and connected scientific and research capacity.**
Intensification of investments in this sector and increasing its participation in international
programmes and initiatives shall correspond with increase of competitiveness and innovation
of Polish defence industry, as well as of significant improvement of its export capacity. As a
consequence the level of modernity of Polish economy will increase and this will develop
new workplaces in the state.

The aforementioned national security system - methodically developed and improved shall
provide: efficient functioning of authority and administration bodies in time of peace, crisis
and war; monitoring and early risk warning system; prevention of all external and internal
challenges and threats to national security; enabling to use instruments of the security policy
(forces and means); coordination of state actions (especially diplomatic, economic, military
and special) in national and allied scope (NATO, the EU), flow and distribution of information,
analysis and synthetic evaluation of national security condition in its all aspects[78].

Development of the modern, integrated national security system of the Republic of Poland by
2022 will require efforts within development of the critical infrastructure protection system,
the strategic reserves system, the socio-cultural base for security and within integration of
national security with socio-economic development. Undertaken actions will be directed to
obtain efficiency and cohesion of functioning of the national security system. Synergistic
influence of those factors and consequent carrying out of assignments resulting from them
will bring about Poland becoming in 2022 a high security level state which will actively
develop the common EU foreign and security policy. It will possess modern national defence
with professional armed forces and with administrative and economy structures capable of
crisis management and defence response, as well as efficient special services.

## III. Objectives of the strategy and directions of intervention 

**1. System of objectives**
Considering conditions and challenges presented in the second and third chapter, the
primary objective of this strategy will be:

**Strengthening efficiency and cohesion of the national security system**

The system, based on the synergy of efforts of particular authorities, institutions and public
services responsible for national security, will be capable of identifying and eliminating
sources, indications and effects of threats to national security. Development of such system
requires a definite orientation of actions on its **efficiency and cohesion. Efficiency will be**
achieved through raising the effectiveness of fundamental elements of the national security
system; cohesion - through improving integration between public and security policies,
through improving cooperation and coordination and ultimately by achieving integration
inside the national security system.

Achieving the main objective will guarantee better realisation of national interests[79]. It will
also contribute to establishing an appropriate capacity of the country, both in terms of
quantity and quality, what will enable maintaining influence on international reality, course of
internal processes and stimulation of positive evolutionary tendencies, both at home and
abroad, especially in the regional dimension. Fulfilment of the main objective will be a total of
achieved operational objectives.

**Operational objectives will serve the achievement of the primary goal. They are an**
expansion of the main objective in the field of highest significance to national security and
are aimed at the authorities of public administration, whereas the whole country is the subject
of the strategy, including bodies of public administration and civil society. Operational
objectives of the _Strategy of Development of the National Security System of the Republic of_
_Poland_ _2022 are as follows:_

**Objective 1**

**Formation of stable international security environment in regional and global**

**dimension**

**Objective 2**

**Strengthening of national defence capabilities**

**Objective 3**

**Development of resilience against threats to national security**


**Objective 4**

**Increase of integration between public policies and the security policy**

**Objective 5**

**Creation of conditions for development of the integrated national security system**

79 The national interests are defined in the National Security Strategy of the Republic of Poland


-----

Operational objectives will be based on two general rules indicated in the main objective:
**efficiency and cohesion. Efficiency is to be achieved through increasing capacity of**
essential elements of the national security system - it will be served by fulfilment of the first
objective, namely _Formation of Stable International Security Environment in Regional and_
_Global Dimension and the second objective, namely Strengthening of National Capacity for_
Defence and the third objective _Development of resistance against threats to national_
_security._

Thanks to the fulfilment of the fourth objective - Increase of integration between public
policies and the security policy, and the fifth - Creation of conditions for development of the
integrated national security system, cohesion of national security system will be provided
(outside and inside).

**2. Operational objectives and directions of interventions of their fulfilment**

### Objective 1. Formation of stable international security environment in Objective 1 regional and global dimension Formation of stable international security environment in regional and global

**dimension**


According to the analysis of external conditions included in the diagnosis of the national
security system (chapter 1), security environment becomes increasingly complex and
dynamic and is characterised by occurrence and diffusion of military and non-military threats,
mainly of an asymmetric nature. Functioning in such a complicated and unpredictable
environment motivates most of the countries to active participation in forming security
environment and in developing cooperation between allies, partners, neighbours and other
subjects of international relations. Poland is among these states with the objective to improve
efficiency of own and common actions within NATO, the EU and other international
organisations of bilateral and multilateral relations. Establishing a powerful international
position of Poland and co-creating a stable security environment require improvement of
effectiveness of international law and institutions and an efficient use of international
instruments in the field of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means
of delivery, armament and disarmament control, ways of confidence establishment and
security and development aid.

**and attention to efficiency of allied mechanisms**

**1.1.1. Strengthening collective defence within NATO**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Improving ability of NATO to carry out assignments in the area of collective defence is the
most significant postulate lodged by Poland at the forum of the North Atlantic Alliance.
Poland consistently espouses strengthening practical aspects related to collective defence,
including especially maintenance and development of appropriate military tools. Most of all,
maintenance of balance between developing capabilities for expeditionary operations and
capabilities to defend the territory of the Alliance, is concerned. Poland emphasizes the
necessity of consistent realisation of allied training connected with Art. 5 NAT, development
of NATO Response Forces, regular inspection and of revision of contingency plans.

Main activities

-  development of adequate capabilities crucial for performance of allied defence tasks;

-  actions in favour of including Polish interests in executive documents constituting

elements of the implementation process of the new Strategic Concept of NATO;

-  continuation of the defence transformation of NATO, aimed at increasing its

effectiveness in the fulfilment of the full spectrum of assignments;

-  striving for organisation and participation in NATO Crisis Management Exercise (CMX)

whose scenarios include Art. 5 operations;

-  preservation of current and acquisition of new NATO infrastructure on the territory of

the Republic of Poland;

-  works for maintaining internal cohesion of the Alliance and for consensus building;

-  active participation of Poland in the _Smart Defence initiative;_

-  continuation of participation in NATO development programmes of designated abilities

such as: _Airborne Early Warning and Control (NAEW&C),_ _Strategic Airlift Capability_
(SAC); Strategic Airlift Interim Solution (SALIS), which will enable Poland to fulfil NATO
requirements within the scope of air space control of low and very low altitudes, as well
as to secure fundamental needs of the Polish Armed Forces on personnel strategic air
transport, weapon and military equipment including oversize cargo; participation in


-----

_Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) which provides monitoring in the regions of_
possible military conflicts and sending information to ground command control, as well
as managing of various command levels in real time;

-  participation in _Cooperative Airspace Initiative (CAI) within the Russia-NATO Council_

constituting an important support tool of fighting against air terrorism and of building
mutual trust in NATO-Russia relations.

**1.1.2. Development of the EU capabilities to perform comprehensive actions in the**

**field of crisis response**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Harmonisation of the EU development abilities shall increase cooperation between civil and
military components of member states. Proposed undertakings are part of conducted
activities and ability development projects, and fulfil the obligations undertaken by Poland.

Main activities

-  support of initiatives eliminating shortages in key military and civil crisis management

capabilities, including Weimar Initiative within the scope of the Common Security and
Defence Policy;

-  active participation of Poland in Pooling & Sharing initiative;

-  support of constitution of the EU platform enabling to acquire new defence abilities;

-  compliance of Polish interest in works to create Single European Sky.

**1.1.3. Development of cooperation with partners from Eastern Europe within NATO**

**and the EU**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Poland supports the strengthening of political dialogue and factual cooperation within the
scope of security between eastern European partner countries. Main instrument of tightening
these relations is the Partnership for Peace (PfP) NATO programme. Within its scope, the
priority is the cooperation with Ukraine and Georgia. Cooperation with Russia is however
very important for security of the whole Euro-Atlantic area. At the EU forum, our country
promotes Polish-Swedish initiative of Eastern Partnership.


-----

Having regard to the above, Poland supports tightening of military cooperation with partner
countries.

within the scope of security and defence, what should supplement initiatives brought
about within the eastern policy of the EU.


**1.1.4 Development of cooperation for energy security on the forum of NATO and the**

**EU**

Description of the issue and justification for action
Defining the role of NATO in energy security at the NATO summit in Bucharest (April 2008)
proved adaptation of the Alliance to new security challenges. Poland was one of the main
supporters of initiating works in this area. Since the Alliance is not being an organisation
specialising in energy security, all action undertaken shall be considered as an added value
and be coordinated with initiatives of other entities. This purpose will be served by the Expert
Centre (NATO Centre of Excellence for Energy Security - ENSEC COE), transformed from
the NATO Energy Security Centre in Lithuania, which will become conceptual and research
back-up facilities for NATO within the scope of energy security, especially within critical
infrastructure protection and routes of energy carriers transportation.

Main activities

-  strengthening of NATO role and abilities within the scope of energy security policy,

including the area of energy critical infrastructure protection;

-  joint works to increase energy efficiency and to develop renewable energy;

-  strengthening of energy solidarity clause;

-  establishment of support instruments for development of the EU energy infrastructure;

-  EU financial support for building interconnectors between energy networks;

-  regulation of issues related to the external energy policy of the EU;

-  conduct of activities promoting energy cooperation in Europe.

**1.1.5. Development of cooperation for cyber security on the forum of NATO and the**

**EU**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Cyber-attacks are an increasing threat to stability and security of the Euro-Atlantic area.
Certain countries possess capabilities to conduct cyber-attacks and whose level might be
comparable to conventional armed attacks. For that reason both NATO and the EU have
attached great importance to cyber security so that it is on a level considered by the highest
political organizations. Security of NATO and EU critical infrastructure depends on their
weakest link. It results in necessity of fulfilling standards and requirements of NATO and the
EU by national infrastructure.


-----

Main activities

-  support of initiatives to reinforce NATO and the EU roles and capabilities within the

cyber security policy and to equip both organizations with instruments providing aid to
other member states (especially small and medium sized countries) which are in
danger of cyber-attacks;

-  support of actions for including issues of cyber security in current planning works of

NATO;

-  cooperation reinforcement between NATO and the EU within the scope of cyber

security, especially in the field of critical infrastructure protection of civil sectors (such
as communication, energy, transportation and finances);

-  active participation of Poland in establishing and functioning of elements of cyber

security structure of the EU and allied countries;

-  improvement of rules and mechanisms of in-department and inter-departmental

cooperation, including the Internal Security Agency and the Ministry of National
Defence;

-  inclusion of new elements arising from NATO and the EU works on the cyber security

policy in the Cyberspace Security Policy of the Republic of Poland.

**1.1.6. Support of effective mechanisms of cooperation between NATO and the EU**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Cooperation of both organisations has been the subject of public discussions for a few years.
Progress in this matter depends on the solution of other bilateral political disputes. In course
of this discussion, Poland clearly supports cooperation reinforcement between NATO and the
EU. Amongst the areas of possible relation improvement, Poland stresses the necessity to
strengthen practical cooperation during missions conducted in the same theatre of activity.

Main activities

-  support of political dialogue between the High Representative of the Union for Foreign

Affairs and Security Policy and the NATO Secretary General;

-  development of the EU and NATO relations through strengthening of operational

cooperation and through harmonisation and synchronisation of NATO defence planning
and the EU defence capabilities.

**Re 1.2. Effective bilateral and multilateral cooperation**

**1.2.1. Strengthening the strategic partnership with the USA**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Reinforcement and maintenance of already existing relations between the Republic of
Poland and the United States of America within the scope of security result from issues the
need of joint undertakings in individual and collective security, global peacekeeping and
further development of security capabilities necessary to respond appropriately to security
risks. The allied mutual position regarding proliferation of weapons of mass destructions and
their means of delivery, including ballistic missiles, as a significant threat to world peace and
international security resulted in a decision to develop NATO new defence capabilities, inter
alia missile defence system. Close cooperation of Poland and the USA includes active
participation in development of the aforementioned system and development of national air
defence system including elements of the missile defence system. American support for
troops of the Polish Armed Forces involved in international military missions is of great
importance, especially considering strategic and logistic support. Subsequent element of


-----

integration of the Polish Armed Forces with the Alliance shall be the contribution of the USA
into development of the Special Forces and achievement by the Command of Special Forces

**1.2.4. Development of cooperation within the Visegrad Group**

Description of the issue and justification for action

The Visegrad Group is an important cooperation and interoperability platform for Poland,
Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary in the region of Central Europe and within the
European Union and NATO. The group unites countries that share similar challenges and
interests, therefore the group possesses natural ability to create intra-EU coalitions to
articulate solutions beneficial for the Group. Reinforcement of the Visegrad Group, especially
its strength and unity, is, from the perspective of Poland, an important element of fulfilment of
Polish national interest within Central Europe and in the wider scope of foreign policy.
Hitherto meetings of the Visegrad Group indicate concurrence of opinions regarding
functioning of NATO and the EU. Current cooperation is mostly political and concentrates on
information and experience exchange within the scope of NATO and the EU. Military
cooperation is restricted and includes joint military training, exchange of operational
experiences, transforming initiatives and mutual support within multinational military units in
NATO and the EU. Currently undertaken actions are directed to provide cooperation of the
Visegrad Group with more practical scope. Another direction of the development is to open
the Visegrad Group for cooperation with other countries (Eastern Europe, Baltic countries,
South-Eastern Europe).

Main activities

-  development of mutual positions represented on international forums;

-  support of mutual initiatives of defence industries;

-  maintenance of regular high-level contacts;

-  sustaining dialogue with Eastern European partners (Russia and Ukraine) without

institutionalising the cooperation framework within the Visegrad Group;

-  cooperation to provide energy solidarity and stronger economic and energy

connections;

-  constitution of the Visegrad Battle Group and stronger operational cooperation of the

armed forces;

-  development of relations with Bulgaria and Romania.

**1.2.5. Development of cooperation in the Baltic Sea region**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Security situation in the Baltic Sea region remains stable. With exception of Russia, all states
of the region are the EU Member States. Most of them simultaneously belong to NATO or
cooperate closely with the Alliance what helps to preserve stability in the region. Problems
existing in the Baltic Sea region concern mainly the non-military aspects of security. They
involve energy, environmental and social issues connected with Schengen border.


-----

Main activities

-  development of regional cooperation within the Council of the Baltic Sea States;

-  strengthening bonds of alliance and partnership with countries of the region;

-  exchange of experiences in the field of energy and ecological security;

-  tightening of military cooperation with countries of the region and respecting the

specifics and different status of particular Baltic Sea region states.

**1.2.6. Development of cooperation with eastern neighbours of Poland within bilateral**

**and multilateral relations**

Description of the issue and justification for action
By virtue of its geographical location, Poland should maintain amity and partnership with its
neighbours. Such cooperation is of our national interest and serves improvement of regional
security. Establishing a partner cooperation with eastern neighbours of Poland is crucial for
national security. The eastern border of Poland constitutes also the eastern border of NATO
and the EU. Considering the above, development of military cooperation between Poland
and member states of political and military alliances other than NATO contributes to increase
of security, confidence and stability of our region.

Main activities

-  establishment of relations strengthening the position of Poland in the region with

reference to development of its strategy both in the Euro-Atlantic and eastern
dimension;

-  support of cooperation between Ukraine and European and Euro-Atlantic structures;

-  development of mechanisms aimed at building mutual confidence between Poland and

information concerning armament purchase abroad and its delivery to regions of
increased risk;

-  establishment of a unit with participation of Eastern Partnership states available for

international operations performed on the United Nations Security Council's mandate;

**1.2.7. Development of friendly relations with countries from other regions of the world**

Description of the issue and justification for action

South Caucasus region gains an increasingly important strategic significance which
manifests in growing political, military and economic engagement of the USA, Russia and
other countries. Poland, as a member of NATO and the EU, ought to play an active part in
strengthening of security and stability of the region. South Caucasus is also perceived as an
alternative region in the field of acquiring fuels, what results in its being crucial for Polish and
European energy security.

Main activities

-  development of expert cooperation with South Caucasus states, increasing their

involvement in European and Euro-Atlantic cooperation mechanisms, including
continuation of projects practically supporting the transformation process of the


-----

Georgian Armed Forces (i.a. internships within the scope of NATO programme of
development of the civil service employed in Georgian security institutions);

-  continuation and development of cooperation with Israel through Strategic Dialogue,

Polish-Israeli Joint Commission for Defence Industries Cooperation, Polish-Israeli Work
Group (Annual Meeting) and through activation of work subgroups for specific projects;

-  conclusion of approximately 50 international agreements in the field of defence,

especially with countries of Europe, Southeast Asia, Southern America and with
international organisations as well as agreements on military and technical cooperation;

-  development of cooperation with BRICS members[83].

**Re 1.3. Increase of efficiency of international law and institutions**

**1.3.1. Increase of efficiency of international law**
Description of the issue and justification for action

Dynamic development of military technology and types of weapons, both conventional and of
mass destruction results in efforts to control this process. The end of the Cold War brought
about intensification in this area. Such activities concern restriction of proliferation and
prevention of consequences of weapons usage that may effect in excessive suffering of civil
population (humanitarian law). Therefore, development of international law contributes to
improvement of security, both in bilateral and multilateral relations. It also influences
mollification of results of military actions in relation to civil population.

Main activities

-  striving for development of legal norms on the international level;

-  undertaking of actions aimed at provision of full universalisation of the established

treaty and legal norms and agreements;

-  introduction of international law acts into the internal legal order (establishment of

adequate executive mechanisms at the national level).

**1.3.2. Support of increase of UN efficiency**

Description of the issue and justification for action

The UN is the only organisation of global reach functioning to provide world peace and
security. The United Nations Security Council is legitimised to exert political, military and
economic pressure in case of threats to or violation of peace or in the event of aggression. A
fundamental challenge to the UN is an effective reaction to modern threats from non-state
entities, i.a. terrorism and international organised crime.

To enhance efficiency of the UN, it is crucial for the organisation to carry out a complex
reform of its system, aimed at improving activity of the organisation, including revitalisation of
the UN General Assembly and a reform of the UN Security Council. From the perspective of
the Republic of Poland, it is crucial to support the process of tightening the EU-UN
cooperation for security, above all in the field of crisis management, conflict prevention and
improvement of effectiveness of peacekeeping operations. Provision of efficient protection of
civilians and implementation of the concept of the Responsibility to Protect[84] is crucial in this
context. An indication of activity of Poland and the EU in this field is the Political and Security

83 Association of states: Brazil, Russia, India, China, the Republic of South Africa.
84 Adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2005, understood as readiness of the international community to take
a general action through the Security Council, based on chapter VII of the UN Charter.


-----

Committee's acceptance of the document concerning increase of effectiveness of the EU
actions on the UN forum on international peace. Its most crucial element is provision of a
better coordination of actions and improvement of information exchange between the EU
structures and the representative offices in New York and Geneva.

Main activities

-  support of initiatives for improving the role of the UN in the field of peacekeeping and

international security and improving the role of the UN Security Council in the same
field;

-  participation in peacekeeping operations performed under the auspices of

the UN;

-  support of the efficiency of the UN in responding to threats resulting from economic

underdevelopment, uneven distribution of goods and unresolved social problems;

-  support of cooperation of the UN with NATO and with the EU, including striving to draw

up a unified standpoint of the EU in the UN;

**1.3.3. Actions for reinforcing the OSCE**

Description of the issue and justification for action

OSCE is an important element of the European security system, on the forum of which a
dialogue and discussion take place between 56 states on economic, political and military
issues and on the human dimension (democratisation processes, the rule of law and human
rights) which are the three dimensions of OSCE. It is a basis for solving conflicts in the area
of OSCE states and for works on responding to new threats to security.

Main activities

-  active engagement in current OSCE actions, suggesting initiatives and actions that

Poland could undertake on the forum of the Organisation;

-  undertaking activity aimed at maintaining the role of OSCE as an important element of

European security system, maintaining active participation in actions connected with
pursuing new vision of relations in the field of security of the Euro-Atlantic region and
revitalisation of the Organisation as a key element of security in the field of preventing
and solving conflicts (especially within realisation of agreements of the Summit in
Astana);

-  maintenance of a close cooperation with key partners in the EU and NATO, active

participation in establishing common standpoints on matters of highest importance for
the OSCE.

**Re 1.4. Strengthening international instruments in the field of non-proliferation of**

**weapons of mass destruction, means of their transportation and global**
**disarmament**


**1.4.1. Support of initiatives for maintaining and developing international instruments**

**in the field of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their**
**means of their delivery, including responding to possibility of its acquisition**
**and use by terrorists**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Acquiring weapons of mass destruction and means of their delivery by new states or nonstate entities may have a negative influence on international security, both in regional and
global dimension. In order to minimise the risk of proliferation of WMD, it is crucial to develop
the discipline of non-proliferation of WMD and means of their transportation. The risk of its


-----

proliferation results mainly from readiness of some states to produce crucial materials,
technology and knowledge accessible to ineligible entities and also from insufficient
protection of these materials and technologies which may consequently facilitate their illegal
acquisition. The threat of possible use of WMD by terrorists is one of the greatest threats to
international security and the results of a potential attack could contribute to destabilisation of
international situation. Improvement of the rules of non-proliferation and active responding to
proliferation of WMD is a priority for the international community in this field.

Main activities

-  support of expansion of legal international base which will be a foundation for

responding to proliferation of WMD in the international field;

-  undertaking actions for improvement and universalisation of mechanisms aimed at

preventing from proliferation of WMD and illegal transfer of materials and technologies
of dual-use;

-  striving for development of legal regulations and state executive mechanisms aimed at

preventing from proliferation of WMD, means of their transportation, materials and
technologies of dual-use;

-  undertaking actions aimed at improving protection of materials and technologies that

might be used to produce WMD;

-  active participation in international organisations and institutions, especially the UN,

NATO, the EU and OSCE and bilateral cooperation with NATO and the EU partners
and third countries;

-  non-military actions (technical and development aid, cross-cultural and interfaith

dialogue).

**Re 1.5. Attention to efficiency and development of control of conventional**

**armament, disarmament and measures of confidence establishment and**
**security**

The control regime of armament and means of confidence establishment and security in
Europe, adopted in the second half of the last century and in force since early nineties,
proved to be effective. Diplomatic actions from the end of the first decade of 21[st] century are
aimed at adopting them to current international conditions. A discussion on their
modernisation is currently in progress.

**1.5.1. Proper execution of existing solutions and seeking new, effective solutions and**

**means of cooperation for confidence establishment and security in Europe**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Agreements on the control of conventional armaments, disarmament and means of building
confidence and security in Europe are a crucial element of the system of security and
cooperation between European states. Abiding by and full realisation of the hitherto accepted
agreements remain a guarantee for maintaining stability and security in Europe in the field of
inter-state relations. Discussions on the future of armament control regimes are presently in
progress, what can conduce to their use on a regional and sub-regional scale and also
outside Europe.

A key international document on measures of confidence establishment and security
(CSBMs – Confidence and Security Building Measures) is _the Vienna Document of 1999._
Alongside with it, the CSBMs system was supplemented by _the Treaty on Open Skies of_
1992.


-----

Main activities

-  abiding by commitments and regulations of restricting military actions established in the

_Vienna Document of 1999;_

-  organisation of broader observation of military actions performed in a scale under the

limits obliging to introduce observers;

-  thorough participation in exchange of information;

-  comprehensive use of quota of active verification undertakings;

-  active participation in negotiations on updating the catalogue of measures of building

confidence and security and other OSCE documents in this field, including
modernisation of _the Vienna Document of 1999 and of_ _the Code of Proceedings on_
_Political and Military Aspects of Security._

**1.5.2. Striving for maintaining multilateral mechanisms of control of armament and**

**disarmament and their further development**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Excessive accumulation of armament by countries results in destabilisation of security
environment and may result in an outbreak of an armed conflict. Armament control enables
maintaining the lowest possible level of the military potential, which, pursuant to the concept
drawn up within the scope of the UN, is sufficient to protect border integrity, preserve internal
order of the state and to participate in peacekeeping missions.

Disarmament mechanisms and control of armament established by _the Treaty on_
_Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE Treaty) include quantitative restrictions of_
armament and equipment, as well as regulations of information exchange and verification
procedures (CFE regime). They are supplemented by the rules of observation flights ought to
be performed over territories of other countries, provided in the provisions of the Treaty on
Open Skies. At the end of 2007, the Russian Federation introduced a unilateral moratorium
concerning application of the provisions included in _the Treaty on Conventional Armed_
_Forces in Europe (CFE) and suggested concluding a new act of international law replacing_
the above mentioned moratorium. Treaty began the series of bilateral and multilateral
diplomatic consultations aiming primarily at Russia's return to the CFE regime. The Republic
of Poland is interested in maintaining the current regime as well as its amendment complying
with the fundamental principles of _the_ _CFE Treaty which contains also the update_
mechanisms.

Main activities

-  active participation in dialogue regarding modernisation of the conventional armament
control in Europe, in particular the CFE Treaty;

-  complete use of quota of active verification projects, including observation flights
conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty on Open Skies;

-  striving together with NATO member states to develop a mandate for negotiations
enabling to undertake further works to restore functioning of _the CFE Treaty or to_
adopt a new regime in the field of conventional armed forces in Europe;

-  maintenance of existing armament control regimes, taking into consideration their
necessity to be supplemented (since the Cold War the major need in the field of
armament control has been to establish transparency and predictability of military
activities and to regain trust between countries).


-----

**1.5.3 Maintenance and improvement of international mechanisms of control of arms**

**trade and export**

Description of the issue and justification for action

The current international arms trade control mechanisms distinguish themselves generally by
a regional and limited character. Their main feature is the regime of armament control and
the technology of its production (Wassenaar Arrangement) concentrating 40 member states.
The availability of weapons on international markets as well as the illegal trade of weapons,
result in their vast accumulation. This situation is more possible to occur in the areas of
ethnic, economic and ideological conflicts which do not have well-established and widely
accepted cultural traditions. Taking that into consideration, the works aimed at adopting and
approving the universal _Arms Trade Treaty_ _(ATT) have been commenced on the United_
Nations’ forum. his treaty will maintain the existing state’s rights, resulting from the
provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and will introduce uniform evaluation criteria
used in the international arms trade.

Main activities

-  maintenance of activity of Polish control regimes at the highest possible level;

-  assistance for Poland in the field of coordinated activities of the European Union in
the process of negotiating the Arms Treaty Control (ATT);

-  maintenance of the national export control system at high quality level;

-  participation in the international information and promotion programmes for third
countries in the field of export control.

**Re 1.6. Reduction of development differences in the world, support of democracy**

**and respect for human rights**

**1.6.1 Increase of efficiency of the Polish development aid**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Eradication of poverty and implementation of the principles of sustainable development, in
parallel with advancement of democracy and respect for human rights result from directions
of the objectives of the Polish foreign policy complying with their political, economic and
security interests. Poland, as a country with rich experience of the process of economic and
political transformation, actively supports promotion of human rights. In addition, our country
is committed to reduce development differences all over the world through implementation of
_the_ _Millennium Development Goals. Poland accomplishes these objectives both in bilateral_
and multilateral cooperation with priority countries of Polish development cooperation.
Poland is mainly focused on supporting development activities in priority countries where the
execution of development co-operation takes place. Development cooperation is pursued in
particular through bilateral aid which is granted by Poland to a country being a recipient of
development aid and through multilateral aid which is granted via international agencies,
institutions and funds.

Main activities

-  providing support, care and security for victims of the armed conflicts, natural
disasters or other disasters by giving them humanitarian assistance;

-  achieving of _the Millennium Development Goals as well as fulfilling international_
obligations in the field of increasing the volume of resources allocated for
development cooperation;


-----

-  increase of efficiency of the development aid provided by Poland through
coordination of major directions of development activities with other departments
participating in the national system of development cooperation.

**Objective 2**

**Strengthening of national defence capabilities**

The purpose of the Polish security policy, in particular the defence policy, is to develop the
defence capabilities providing protection of national interests as well as cooperation with
NATO and the EU Member States which aim at counteracting security threats within the
Euro-Atlantic Region. Furthermore, it is also important to simultaneously maintain the proper
balance between national defence necessities and allied commitments. To face this
challenge, it is necessary to develop a modern understanding of national defence and
effective forms of national self-involvement in stabilisation of the international situation.

Pursuant to the analysis regarding the external and internal conditions which is included in
the diagnosis of the national security system, functioning of the country in a dynamic and
complex security environment, where military and non-military threats occur, entails the need
to possess and develop the efficient and effective system of national defence. Providing
continuity of the country during a political and military crisis or in time of war and establishing
a strong position of Poland on the international arena and particularly in NATO and the EU
Member States, require professional and modern Polish Armed Forces as well as the
effective method of using special services, administrative and economic structures as well as
scientific and research potential[85].

85 Provisions of this objective are included in the Main Directions of Development of the Polish Armed Forces and
_Preparation for National Defence for the Period 2013–2022 which were issued by the President of the Republic of_
Poland on November 8, 2011

air and sea borders;

-  improvement of training level;

-  improvement of procedures and doctrines.

**2.1.2. Participation of the Polish Armed Forces in stabilisation of international**

**situation**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Involvement in operations abroad is a tool of the national policy which directly influences
forming of the position of Poland on the international arena. The level of the involvement is
dependent on the country’s abilities resulting principally from the possessed financial,
human, physical and organisational resources. The level of military ambition of the Republic
of Poland requires maintaining the capacity of the Polish Armed Forces on a quality and
quantity level indispensable for efficient deterrence and guaranteeing Poland the defence
credibility on the international arena, in particular amongst the allies. It also ought to include
increasing expectations of the allies on the Polish contribution to strengthening of regional
and global stability.

Experiences gained from participation in the operations abroad unambiguously indicate the
increase of significance of non-military actions, including increased activity of nongovernmental organisations and agencies, as well as of civil, economic and political
instruments. Effective engagement in stabilising the international situation requires
implementation of the concept of comprehensive approach to future operations, i.e.
integration and achievement of the synergy of using all involved components. To establish
conditions for more active and more versatile inclusion of Poland into resolving crisis
situations, there are being drawn up _the_ _Regulations and Procedures for Planning,_
_Preparation and Participation of Polish Civil-Military Contingents in Crisis Response_
_Operations Abroad. Their implementation will contribute to systematisation of the national_
planning process on the political and inter-ministerial level and to development of legal and
financial regulations relating to participation of Polish forces and means in operations abroad.

deploy and sustain in the region of operation.

**2.1.3. Provision of military aid to government bodies during crisis situations of a non-**

**military character**

Description of the issue and justification for action

The Polish Armed Forces are one of the key elements of the national crisis management
system that perform tasks related to supporting public administration institutions in the event
of non-military crisis situations. Their experience in such activities and occurrence of new
threats indicate a necessity for improvement.

**2.1.4. Increase of potential of modern armament and military equipment including**

**participation in various military programmes**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Managing challenges and threats requires from the armed forces to be a combination of joint
modular components. They must be mobile, network-centric and capable of performing
missions in every environment. The ability to carry out any mission or assignment, to act
immediately and to strike effectively and precisely will decide about their value. For this
purpose, they should be equipped with technologically advanced, combat effective and
resilient to threats from cyberspace, highly automated, robotic equipment and armament. To
manage the aforementioned, operational capabilities will be developed in the field of:
command and control, reconnaissance, engagement, survival and protection of troops,
logistic support.

Moreover, school and training systems, as well as logistic ones, ought to be improved.
Critical difficulties in acquiring the necessary defence capabilities by Poland reside in high
costs of modern armament systems and military equipment as well as in limited capabilities
of the national defence industry. The aforementioned factors result in the necessity to seek

alternative methods for developing and obtaining deficit defence abilities, one of which is
Polish participation in international programmes under the aegis of NATO and European
Defence Agency. Another crucial element of effective modernisation of the Polish Armed
Forces is an effective system of acquisition, utilisation and withdrawal of armament and
military equipment of the Polish Armed Forces, enabling implementation of armament and
military equipment fulfilling the operational requirements with rational management of
financial means. Within the scope of managing this system, the Armament Inspectorate was
established to carry out the process of acquiring armament and military equipment for the
needs of the Polish Armed Forces.

Main activities

-  acquisition and modernisation of armament and military equipment within the scope of
operational and armament programmes;

-  increase of contribution of the national industrial defence capabilities to the process of
modernising the Polish Armed Forces and improving effectiveness of entities of Polish
industrial defence capabilities on the international armament market;

-  maximisation of profits gained from participation in international programmes, including
financial benefits (reduced costs of acquisition of capabilities), technological benefits
(development of R&D units and facilitated transfer of technologies) and, in consequence,
industrial benefits (stimulation of economic development and local labour market);

-  improvement of the system of acquisition, utilisation and withdrawal of armament and
military equipment of the Polish Armed Forces, including: implementation of mechanisms
providing more effective management of armament and military equipment life cycle,
providing high standards of personnel managing programmes within the training and
professional development system, implementation of modern methods of managing
programmes and projects, consolidation of ministerial regulations.

**2.1.5. Achievement of interoperability and compatibility by the Polish Armed Forces**

**within NATO and the EU**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Acquiring interoperability and compatibility by the Polish Armed Forces within the scope of
NATO and the EU is the fundamental condition for Poland to obtain credibility in the Alliance
within the framework of the common security system.

Interoperability in international environment is achieved primarily through appropriate
preparation of staff, troops and units, through achievement of inter-operational,
organisational and functional structures capable of performing combined operations.
Moreover, it is crucial to establish interoperability of automated command and control
systems of means of warfare in the national and allied structure and to maintain and develop
systems providing security on battlefields (combat identification, monitoring of troops
position).

A practical tool of establishing interoperability is the implementation of NATO
Standardisation Agreement (STANAG) which constitutes records of agreements between
some or all of NATO member states on using the same or similar military equipment,
ammunition, supplies and stock as well as operational, logistic and administrative
procedures.


-----

Main activities

-  ensuring a high level of units manning and equipment with armament and military

equipment in order to acquire operational capability to undertake a complete spectrum
of actions in a short period of time within the scope of a national or allied operation;

-  rotational participation of units declared as capable of being deployable in allied

training undertakings and subjecting them to the process of national and allied
certification in order to achieve required standards;

-  successive introduction of national command support systems to the Polish Armed

Forces compatible with analogical allied systems within the framework of NATO and
the EU;

-  defining the conditions providing achievement of standards required by NATO and the

EU in the documents containing requirements for armament and military equipment;

-  increase of the implementation level of the Standardisation Agreement (STANAG).

**Re 2.2. Development of organisational structures of the Polish Armed Forces**

**(flexible and efficient organisation)**

**2.2.1. Improvement of command and control structures**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Introduction of new combat forms and modern techniques requires a more sophisticated form
of planning and supervising military activities. A matter of particular importance becomes
efficiency of the system of commanding and controlling the Polish Armed Forces. Taking into
account the fact that practically all modern military operations are performed with
participation of different services of the Polish Armed Forces (joint operations), it is crucial to
fully implement the modern concept of jointness to the command and control system of the
Polish Armed Forces.

Main activities



-  formation of consolidated structures of command at the central (strategic) level based

on three functions: strategic planning, general command and operational command;

-  establishment of transparency of the structure of command authorities through

reduction of their number and by shortening the chain of commanding line;

-  establishment of an integrated command system compatible with allies and capable of

operating in a network-centric environment;

-  concentration and integration of organisational units functioning at the strategic and

operational level and carrying out similar assignments;

-  maximum assimilation of the structure of command and control bodies of the Polish

Armed Forces in time of peace, crisis and war;

-  implementation of modern methods of commanding and controlling and implementation

of decision support systems;

-  undertaking actions concentrated on ‘quantity-to-quality’ transformation (reduction of

the number of structures, while investing in development, education and training of
personnel and in their selection regarding competence and predisposition to accept
specific service positions).


-----

**2.2.2. Establishment of the module structures**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Current world transformations, especially their pace and challenges for the Polish Armed
Forces (preparing them for prompt responding and all types of intervention) result in the fact
that it becomes highly desirable to possess units with universal organisational structures,
efficiently commanded and supplied, ready to be immediately used in any region of activity.

In the course of alterations, actions will be undertaken, aimed at levelling the hierarchical
structure with possibility for it to be supplemented with the elements treated as assignment
structures to be formed immediately. Combat units with maximum degree of universalisation
and unification will be established, fully prepared to execute autonomous activity and of high
independence level.

Construction of such a system will be based on the modular elements providing flexibility and
the ability to form groupings of diverse character. On the one hand, they will support a quick
adaptation of structures for changing needs of the battlefield, on the other – collision-free and
multivariate integration and formation of larger organisational structures. Operational use of
units, dependant on the mission’s mandate, assignment and local conditions will be capable
of taking place partially (in autonomic modules) or as a whole.

Main activities

-  introduction of modern reconnaissance systems;

-  increase of mobility of the army;

-  equipping the army with modern systems of command control and real-time battlefield

imagery;

-  adaptation of doctrines, training programmes and improvement of military training.

**2.2.3. Achievement of standards in the field of manning and equipping commands**

**and military units and increase of their availability**

Description of the issue and justification for action

It is necessary for commands and operational units in time of peace to maintain the required
indicators[87] of completion of personnel, armament and military equipment and properly
placed stock of supplies. Level of completion of military units translates into specific periods
of their availability for performance of tasks within the framework of allied operations (forces
declared for NATO) and assignments resulting from operational needs of the Polish Armed
Forces.

Main activities

-  increase of the number of highly manned and equipped units (above 90%) capable
of undertaking actions within a short period of time without the necessity of their
mobilisation development;

-  completion of the disposition process of the Polish Armed Forces.

87 Levels of these indicators are defined in ACO Forces Standards – AFS.


-----

**2.2.4. Establishment of the modern system of reserves (National Reserve Forces)**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Reinforcement of the professional army ought be carried out by the reserve forces that may
be quickly used in a situation of intensified, military or non-military, threats, related to the
necessities of crisis management, including natural disasters and liquidation of their effects,
antiterrorist actions, protection of property, search and rescuing or protecting human life and
health. Trained reserve soldiers will reinforce the Polish Armed Forces through combining
service duties and work obligations. This purpose shall be served by the selected voluntary
reserve soldier resources remaining at disposal and with crisis response assignments for
specific official positions in military units. The assignments were given as the result of
voluntarily concluded contracts to perform military service in the army reserve. The resources
are called National Reserve Forces (NRF).

The suspension of obligatory forms of military service reduced the intake of trained reserves.
In order to assemble trained reserve soldiers resources, also for the needs of the NRF, the
system of volunteer training was established within the scope of preparatory service.

Main activities

-  recruitment of volunteers for preparatory service and service within the framework of
the National Reserve Forces;

-  introduction of the modern motivation system for possible volunteers for the NRF and
their employers;

-  provision of a proper level of training and equipment for the NRF soldiers.

**2.2.5. Optimisation of the logistic capacity**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Logistic potential of the Polish Armed Forces requires constant development and cooperation
with international logistics and adaptations to the necessities of supported troops. Such
optimisation will encompass alterations in the stationary system of logistics support (regional
logistic bases and military economic units subjected to them) and logistic mobile capacity.

Main activities

-  simplification of logistics command, rational use of infrastructure, introduction of

modernisation solutions to the field of logistic supplies management and
implementation of new technologies regarding supervision of the supplies and storing
material means and munitions;

-  formation of a modular structure and achievement of the ability of logistic units to

perform autonomous operational actions and to support joint, multinational
expeditionary operations and tactical development in all climate conditions;

-  Entrusting resource management of military infrastructure in garrisons to economy

branches;

-  reduction of the size of logistic personnel in favour of 10-20 persons for teams of

several persons equipped in proper instruments, procedures and funds, enabling more
efficient protection of troops (including allied troops) and infrastructure management –
performance through outsourcing.


-----

**2.2.6 Improvement of military health service capacity to provide support for the**

**Polish Armed Forces**

Description of the issue and justification for action

The mission of the military health service is to provide medical support of troops both at
home and abroad. Long-term underfunding of the military health service has resulted in the
situation of its possessing only a limited amount of equipment fulfilling the requirements of a
modern battlefield and the requirements of NATO in the area of cooperation in multinational
environment. Moreover, the shortage of manpower frequently disables performance of some
tasks. In its current state, the military health service is not capable of providing troops with
effective medical support.

Main activities

-  improvement of work benefits, especially among physicians and doctors, through
introducing the system of inducements to remain in service and the training and
professional development system which takes into consideration specificity of military;

-  implementation of legal acts enabling operation of the military medical security
system which takes into account specificity of medical security of the Polish Armed
Forces on the territory of Poland and especially during military missions abroad;

-  continuation of purchasing modern devices and equipment particularly concentrating
on container-tent systems, specialist containers, armoured medevac vehicles (tracked
and wheel chassis), new type of special vehicles and sanitary vehicles, new models
of individual and collective first-aid-kits;

-  combat first aid training for soldiers of combat units (according to the 10-1-2 rule: first
aid should be applied within first 10 minutes since injury);

-  adaptation of competences of medical personnel to factual tasks and skill levels
(military paramedics);

-  development of the aeromedical evacuation system at tactical and strategic levels;

-  redundant health care potential ought to be transferred out of the Ministry of National
Defence.

**2.2.7. Implementation of the Integrated Multilevel IT System for the Ministry of**

**National Defence**

Description of the issue and justification for action

The Ministry of National Defence lacks the solutions enabling to obtain current and
comprehensive information on resources which may be used by the Polish Armed Forces[88].
Lack of this knowledge impairs effective management of military resources and reaching
optimal and rational decisions within the scope of ministry management and armed forces
command. Establishment of an effective supply system (restoration of resources) without
data on current status of any organisational element of the armed forces and availability of
internal resources (within the Ministry of National Defence) and external resources is
impossible.

88 The resources are understood as logistic, financial and human resources. Management of resources concerns

the resources already being a part of the Ministry, planned to be acquired within the framework of performing
plans to supply the armed forces and also concerns the resources of national economy planned to be acquired
within the framework of mobilisation in crisis and war situations and also the resources acquired within the
scope of NATO and the EU.


-----

Main activities

-  establishment and implementation of the integrated, unified IT system supporting
logistics, finance and human resources management and simultaneously providing
activity standardisation as well as exchange and integration of data between
organisational units of the Ministry of National Defence in these fields;

-  construction of the mobile version of the Integrated Multilevel IT System for Ministry
of National Defence supporting management during training, exercises and
participation of the Polish Armed Forces in missions.

**Re 2.3. Improvement of the education level of the Polish Armed Forces**

**2.3.1 Improvement of the education and vocational training level of professional**

**soldiers**

Description of the issue and justification for action

In conditions of professionalisation of the Polish Armed Forces, it is necessary to constantly
increase the level of professional training for soldiers. Currently, it consists of two forms –
postgraduate studies, qualifying courses (which prepare to access substantive higher rank office)
and additional courses (preparing to render services in current office). The extremely important
factor in professional improvement is increasing of language competence, in particular command
of English as it is a basic communication tool in NATO and the EU.

Main activities

-  continuation to implement undertakings as described in annual professional training
schedules for professional soldiers of the Polish Armed Forces as well as undertakings
described in schedules of foreign language training and examining in the Ministry of
National Defence.

**2.3.2. Improvement of the military training and vocational development level of**

**professional soldiers**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Training of commanders, headquarter staff and the Polish Armed Forces, including National
Reserve Forces, shall be directed at sustaining of required operational capabilities to perform
national and allied defence tasks, participating in multinational and allied peacekeeping and
stabilisation operations as well as fighting against terrorism and, in the event of non-military
crisis situation, supporting public administration bodies in recovery.

Within the scope of exercises, various units of the armed forces are trained to participate in a
national joint operations. Thus capabilities of the Operational Command of the Polish Armed
Forces to command the forces in joined operations with participation of allied reinforcing
force are exercised and improved. Part of training undertakings is the cooperation of the

The Lessons Learned System in the Polish Armed Forces is a tool designed to support
command and operational capabilities of the Polish Armed Forces as well as their functioning in


-----

time of peace by introducing alterations and promoting the best solutions in a particular area[89].
The principal assignments are the following: obtaining and analysing of information referring to
the operational capabilities gained during participation of the forces in operations, implementation
of training process and other resulting from activity of the Polish Armed Forces; drawing up
conclusions and recommending solutions and popularising the accepted changes; managing
database information.

Main activities

-  improvement of the Lessons Learned System in the Polish Armed Forces based on
uniformed and universal process of a lesson learned system, permanent system
structures (Doctrine and Training Centre of the Polish Armed Forces) and
professional education of personnel;

-  development of process of learning lessons which encompasses stages of:
identification and observation, analysis, improvement of corrective measures and
appointment of tasks; implementation and monitoring, verification – determination of
efficiency of corrective measures.

-  development of specialist information system and appropriate conceptual apparatus

**Re 2.4. Strengthening of national administration and economic structures to**

**function in crisis situations and to support national defence**

**2.4.1. Improvement of non-military defence preparations**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Non-military defence preparations are necessary to provide survival and proper functioning
of the state, including support of the Polish Armed Forces and the allied reinforcing force in
the event of external national security threat and in the event of war. For this area,
appropriate legal and organisational solutions were designed. Regarding the dynamic
character of contemporary threats, variable economic conditions and professionalisation of
the Polish Armed Forces, this area requires constant improvement. Optimisation of nonmilitary defence preparations shall be conducted to increase their effectiveness, adequacy,
unity and coordination of actions.

Main activities

-  improvement of logistic support and of the system of technical national security
management through systematic increase of competence and abilities of the entities
as well as through development of technical infrastructure of management system;

-  establishment within administrative bodies and the Polish Armed Forces of the unified
IT database on available defence resources accessible for the requirements of the
allied reinforcing force;

-  developing solutions to improve economy mobilisation through designing legal
mechanisms enabling to adapt the scope of assignments, as described in the

national and regional trainings conducted jointly with the ‘Anakonda’ multilevel
operational Polish Armed Force exercise. Moreover, increasing involvement of nonmilitary structures in military defence exercise and training as well as increasing
participation of persons on state executive posts in defence trainings within the
framework of High Level Defence Courses;

-  development of the audit formula of defence task performance extending them by
practical elements in order to verify factual preparation of non-military structures in
the event of external threat to national security and in time of war;

-  development of the mechanism enabling collaboration of experts and entrepreneurs
to conduct, in enterprise of the entrepreneurs, defence preparations allowing to obtain
and maintain an expected level of production and services in time of war.

**2.4.2. Strengthening of the defence industry**

Description of the issue and justification for action
In the package of factors supporting development of industrial defence capabilities, the
support of manufacturing operations and exporting operations of that sector will be of great
significance. This activity ought to establish conditions to increase competitiveness and
innovative levels of industrial defence capabilities in an extent that provides satisfaction of all
necessities of the national security sphere (in priority technological areas) as well as to
enable to strengthen the position of national armament and military equipment providers on
the international weapon market and enable to intensify their presence on the European
defence equipment market.
In order to increase the research and development activities for national defence and
security as well as to provide close cooperation between weapon and military equipment
manufacturers and research institutes, the consolidated research and development base
shall be constituted. Simultaneously, it is significant to increase funding for R&D in priority
areas of military technology.

Regarding development of industrial defence capabilities and as specified in the diagnosis, it is
most important to transfer innovative technologies between military and civil sectors. It is
necessary to increase the use of development capacity of this flow, especially to undertake
actions stimulating the flow of knowledge, human and equipment resources between military and
civil sectors.

Main activities

To effectively support industrial defence, the consolidated structure of national industrial
defence capabilities and reinforcement of supporting mechanisms and financial instruments
ought to be developed. The following will be necessary to succeed:

-  adaptation of production capacity as well as of research and development aspects of
defence industry to the needs of national recipients and to the export opportunities;

-  development and implementation of the weapon and military equipment acquisition
system enabling foreseeable and stable ordering procedure from the Ministry of
National Defence;

-  coordination of the science and research policy and development works within the
scope of weapon and military equipment;

-  extension of product portfolio of industrial defence capabilities within the scope of
modern weapon and military equipment;

-  location of offset obligations in Polish defence industry to acquire necessary
capabilities securing fulfilment of fundamental security and defence interests of the
country;


-----

-  introduction to off-set agreements of obligations related to carrying out programmes
important to national security and defence;

-  introduction of Polish entities into creation of an innovative and competitive base of
European defence technology and industry;

-  defining institutional and legal framework enabling the transfer of military technologies to
the civil sector and the activity limiting barriers for such transfer.

**2.4.3. Development of the Host Nation Support (HNS)**
Description of the issue and justification for action

In the event of a threat to external security, the Republic of Poland may rely on the support of
the North Atlantic Alliance provided by the introduction of the allied reinforcing force. After
their arrival in Poland, they will require a broadly understood support within the scope of:
access to the infrastructure, transport, materiel resources, services and in many other fields
inseparably related to an effective performance of a military mission by the armies stationing
on the territory of our country. Moreover, while fulfilling the obligations resulting from the
Article 5 NAT, the Polish Armed Forces of the Alliance may move throughout Poland’s
territory to carry out an operation on a territory of another NATO member state. Therefore,
the actions undertaken to prepare Poland for carrying out tasks deriving from obligations of
the host-nation (HNS) denote specific challenges for all the country’s organisational
structures, both in the civil and military dimension.

Effective cooperation between the Polish Armed Forces and the civil environment requires
establishment of proper contacts (mutual relations) between them and development of rules
for that cooperation.

Main activities

-  asserting formal and legal solutions for carrying out tasks stemming from the host
nation’s function and the necessity for coordination of civil and military actions;

-  preparing infrastructure to secure hosting of the allied reinforcing force;

-  introducing compatible electronic databases of the state’s resources which may be

assigned for the needs of the Allied Reinforcement Forces, including databases of civil
experts;

-  establishing HNS Points of Contact and implementing documents (guides, instructions)

providing conditions for proper performance of HNS tasks.

**2.4.4. Strengthening of the civil and military co-operation (CIMIC)**

Description of the issue and justification for action

In time of peace, crisis and war, troops and units of the Polish Armed Forces will, while
participating in the operations at home or abroad, be carrying out the assignments in a direct
contact with the civil environment, understood as governmental, self-government and nongovernmental organisations, international institutions and civil population of the region in
which the operation is being executed. Successful operations highly depend on the capability
to properly establish cooperation with the civil environment. The collaboration will
concentrate on enabling to use civil resources to maintain the capability to continue the
operations, supporting the civil environment in the critical fields and on mutual exchange of
information.

Main activities

-  continuous improvement of the structures responsible for civil-military cooperation;


-----

-  maintaining in readiness forces and means crucial for fulfilling the allied obligations,

accepted within the scope of civil-military cooperation;

-  establishing regulations of cooperation procedures.

**2.4.5. Establishment of specific system solutions regulating the field of civil defence**

Description of the issue and justification for action

A significant area of national security is civil defence[90], concentrated on protection of
population, workplaces, public utility devices, cultural goods, rescuing and providing help to
victims of wars. Former solutions of this area were inadequate[91] and not exhausting all of the
assignment fields. The regulations do not unambiguously specify the tasks of civil defence,
performed in time of peace, confining themselves exclusively to planning, organising and
training activity and to disseminating knowledge on the subject. It was partly brought about
by the revocation of the Article 140 of the _Act on Common Duty to Defend the Republic of_
_Poland which constituted the statutory delegation for the Council of Ministers to issue a_
regulation specifying obligations and rights of the authorities in civil defence, matters of
formation of civil defence and signals of elementary warning and alerting. The revocation of
the mentioned article and the lack of any new regulation as its substitute significantly limited
the ability to perform the tasks within the scope of civil defence.

Main activities

-  introducing solutions to maintain continuity of responsibility for protection of the
population in any situation, including the state of war;

-  precise regulation of civil defence actions and introducing new solutions in this field
requires preparing adequate legislation amendments. A legal document ought to be
drawn up and it would order competence and tasks of all bodies of public
administration, public institutions, voluntary organisations and other entities obliged to
carry out assignments in the field of civil defence.

**Re 2.5. Modification of national defence planning**

Defence planning is a process of shaping national defence system enabling to set and
achieve goals in the field of defence, encompassing stages of planning, programming and
budgeting, the process of their supervision and evaluation as well as operational planning.
National defence planning concerns the Polish Armed Force, administrative and economic
structures and is harmonised with allied planning. Paying attention to the necessity of
adapting the process to changing conditions, including correlation with the system of
managing national development and NATO defence planning, is necessary to improve the
national defence planning. It ought to be concentrated on enhancing its transparency and
cohesion, above all, at the strategic level and with reference to the Polish Armed Forces.

**2.5.1. Modification of defence planning at the strategic level**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Defence planning on the strategic level is the initial stage of drawing up strategic solutions in
the area of national defence. It is a long-term process requiring cohesion of objectives both in

-----

the field of politics and in achieving expected defence capabilities by the elements of the
national defence system, adequate to existing and anticipated threats resulting from
dynamically changing security environment. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt a uniform
legal and creative ground for every undertaking related to defence planning and a necessity
to undertake actions improving cohesion and efficiency of the planning process.

Important elements of defence planning are NATO Targets which are the basic tool in
achieving the assumed level of ambition by the Alliance and in developing defence abilities
by its member states. NATO Targets for the Republic of Poland are the collectively
negotiated set of Poland’s requirements and commitments, concerning development and
gaining capabilities as well as allotting the forces to the common forces of NATO, predicted
to be used in a given period of time. Its fulfilment is a Polish contribution to asserting
capabilities of the Alliance to perform tasks of NATO and a practical tool in forming modern
and professional Polish Armed Forces.

Main activities

-  adopting the SRSBN RP as an initial document for national defence planning;

-  limiting the number of binding defence planning documents of a strategic character;

-  specifying the extent of competence of particular entities participating in the process of

defence planning;

-  improving the process of agreeing and achieving NATO Targets for the Republic of

Poland;

-  enhancing cohesion of military and non-military defence planning, i.a. by establishment

of a mechanism providing a more efficient coordination of works related to specifying
and updating the needs of the Polish Armed Forces and the allied forces  satisfied by
the non-military defence structures.

**2.5.2. Modification of planning and programming of development of the Polish Armed**

**Forces**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Planning development of the Polish Armed Forces encompasses a set of concept and
planning activities undertaken to set the directions of forming and modernising the Polish
Armed Forces identified with respect to achieving, maintaining and developing the required
operational capabilities. Planning of the development of the Polish Armed Forces is
concentrated on actions fundamental for gaining specific capabilities in the field of doctrines,
organisational structure, training courses, technical modernisation, leadership, educating and
training human resources, infrastructure and interoperability[92]. The need for improvement of
both processes was identified in the course of work of the Ministry of Defence.

Main activities

-  developing the procedures of defining priority needs of the Polish Armed Forces;

-  concentrating the planning and programming of development of the Polish Armed

Forces on achieving specific operational capabilities;

-  using risk analyses when programming development of the Polish Armed Forces of the

Republic of Poland;

-  considering a long-term perspective in developing the Polish Armed Forces.

**Re 2.6. Efficient promotion of defence**

Description of the issue and justification for action

The process of professionalisation of the Polish Armed Forces and changes in the nature of
assignments carried out by them, may result in loosening of bonds between army and
society, or even, in a further perspective, in alienation of the army and in perceiving it as a
closed, hierarchical business corporation. Therefore, both now and in future, it becomes
highly important to present the Polish Armed Forces to large groups of receivers and to
emphasize its missions, targets and assignments in the interest of the Republic of Poland
and Polish citizens. Developing a positive image of the Polish Armed Forces as an
organisation transforming into a modern and professional army needs to serve the purpose
of establishing social acceptance for changes introduced in the Polish Armed Forces and to
facilitate obtaining best candidates for the military service.

Changes in the media environment and development of technologies in the field of
communication, require adaptation and enhancement of the used promotional tools. Global
audience, interactivity, multimedia transmission and development of mobile technologies are
becoming the attributes of new communicational processes. Possessing a wide spectrum of
multimedia materials aimed at the most significant groups of receivers and having a system
enabling an efficient promotional transmission of the Polish Armed Forces is crucial for
developing the image and the brand of a 21st century army.

Main activities

-  promotional activity will include development of a positive image of Polish soldiers,
the Polish Armed Forces and the Ministry of National Defence, both in the country
and abroad;

-  if promotional campaigns are necessary, they will be pursued to support the process
of recruitment for the candidate service, preparatory service, professional military
service and service within the National Reserve Forces. Such campaigns will deliver
regular promotional actions. A crucial aspect for the promotion of defence is to
establish the cooperation with social, media and institutional partners.

Description of the issue and justification for action

The current model of acquiring armament and military equipment in the Ministry of National
Defence respects the necessity for research in the field of defence technologies and techniques
to a very small extent. A great challenge is to properly identify needs of future users. In most of
the cases, the necessity for research stems directly from the R&D environment. Such attitude is
not improper in principal, however it should possess a supplementary character for the needs
defined by the users. Also the scale of financing individual projects and R&D programmes by the
state-run institutions is insufficient as well as lack of adequate structures for managing the
projects/programmes.


-----

Main activities

-  introducing in Poland selected solutions, already implemented in other EU and NATO
member states, in a manner which considers the personnel and financial capacity of
Polish institutions;

-  drawing up the regulations on using research outcomes in the process of acquiring
armament and military equipment;

-  establishing mechanisms facilitating implementation of elaborated technologies into
production and into equipment of the Polish Armed Forces;

-  close cooperation between producers and end-users ought to be guaranteed within
the research performed in the field of defence technologies and techniques, what will
provide concurrence between the outcome of the research and expectations;

-  expenditure on the research and technologies should be increased to 2% of the
means spent annually on defence and the number of programmes carried out within
the scope of international cooperation to 20% of this amount, according to the
provisions of the European Defence Research and Technology Strategy.

**2.7.2. Intensification of activities aimed at active participation of Polish research and**

**industrial centres in international armament programmes**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Polish scientific and industrial entities still involve themselves insufficiently in international
programmes and R&D projects. This situation is gradually improving but an even greater
engagement is necessary. Participation of representatives of Polish entities in projects carried
out in the international formula enables to gain new knowledge and experience, reinforcing their
potential and competitiveness at the same time. Involvement in the projects carried out within the
international cooperation, such as the EU’s _7. Framework Programme for Research and_
_Technological Development[93], will reduce the technological gap between Polish entities and their_
European counterparts.

Main activities

-  establishing mechanisms enabling to increase engagement of Polish R&D and industrial
entities in the projects carried out in international environment;

-  optimising the use of different sources of financing the projects;

-  increasing the level of co-financing of the projects by the entities engaged in their
realisation, in particular by industrial entities.

**Re 2.8. Improvement of reconnaissance capabilities and the capacity to protect**

possess credible data. Considering the character of the information, their obtaining remains
mainly in the sole competence of the special security services, both civil (Internal Security
Agency and Intelligence Agency) and military (Military Counterintelligence Service and
Military Intelligence Service). Improvement of reconnaissance capabilities of recognition,
prevention and fighting contemporary threats are carried out by diverse initiatives at the
operational, organizational and even legal level. These are usually applicable to the current
procedures of conduct, structural changes within special services or participation in the law
and rulemaking process regarding national security of the Republic of Poland. Cooperation
with national and international partners is a significant element.

Main activities

-  developing new methods of monitoring, detecting and fighting threats to national
security and new methods of fighting them;

-  cooperation with partners within the scope of prevention against threats to internal
security;

-  systematic improvement of coordination mechanisms of functioning of state agencies
responsible for detection and fighting threats to national security.

**2.8.2. Improvement of reconnaissance capabilities at all command levels within the**

**national, allied and coalition system**

Description of the issue and justification for action

The Polish Armed Forces develop the capability to obtain information about enemy and
operational environment. Those activities are aimed at collecting, analysing, accessing,
visualising and exchanging data on all command levels.

Main activities

-  development and technical modernisation of defence reconnaissance system;

-  integration of services reconnaissance systems with command and weapon systems

on all command levels;

-  standardisation of reconnaissance procedures in accordance with ratified and

implemented standardised documents of the EU and NATO;

-  preparation and participation of reconnaissance units in allied and coalition training,

research and development undertakings and more.

**Objective 3**

-  Objective 3. Development of resistance against threats to national security Development of resilience against threats to national security


The diagnosis of national security system proved the necessity of critical infrastructure
protection and of establishment of modern system of strategic reserves. Intervention
priorities and directions grouped around objective 3 are oriented to increase efficiency in this
area so as to improve national resilience to military and non-military threats, including
emergency situations and unpredictable events.


-----

Priorities and directions of intervention for Objective 3 include:

**3.1. Increase of critical infrastructure resilience**
3.1.1. Implementation and update of the _National Critical Infrastructure Protection_
_Programme_
3.1.2. Implementation of national cooperation mechanism between participants of the
critical infrastructure protection system.

**_Programme_**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Based upon experience in protection of structures subject to obligatory protection as
described in the _Act on Protection of Persons and Property of 22[nd ]August 1997[94] and those_
subject to special protection as in the _Regulation of the Council of Ministers of 24[th] June 2003_
_on the Objects Particularly Important for Security and National Defence_ _and on their Special_
_Protection, it proved necessary to supplement the scope of critical infrastructure protection_
not only with physical protection but also with elements which shall provide its uninterrupted
functioning, i.e. technical protection, personal protection, ICT protection and legal protection.
Moreover, it indicated weakness of the method used to impose obligations on critical
infrastructure operators by acts or regulations, as there is no possibility either to conduct the
audit or in any other manner to control fulfilment of those obligations. Regarding the above,
critical infrastructure protection shall to a greater extent involve entities that manage the
critical infrastructure, yet not through obligations but conscious participation in undertakings
aiming at improving safety of systems significant to proper society functioning, by
intensification of cooperation between private and public sector within that scope.

94 Journal of Laws of 2005, No. 145, item 1221, as amended.


-----

Main activities

-  in order to overcome the weaknesses of critical infrastructure protection, the concept
described in the _National Critical Infrastructure Protection Programme (NCIPP) ought_
to be carried out[95];

-  as a primary rule of development of the NCIPP (and of the critical infrastructure
protection system), the rule of joint responsibility[96] of public administration bodies and
critical infrastructure operators will be adopted. The rule may contribute to increase of
efficiency of undertaken actions.

-  NCIPP is the element uniting critical infrastructure protection efforts and providing aid
to all operators of critical infrastructure and to administration, as it includes the vision
of goals and standards of critical infrastructure protection, as well as goals of and
standards for cooperation between entities and bodies performing that task.

**3.1.2. Implementation of national cooperation mechanism between participants of the**

**critical infrastructure protection system.**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Mechanisms of cooperation between participants of the critical infrastructure protection
system are decisive of effectiveness and value of the NCIPP. No mechanisms of cooperation
between owners of structures significant to national security have existed so far.
Implementation and functioning of the cooperation mechanism between participants of the
critical infrastructure protection system shall be the practical indication of public and private
partnership in this scope. The mechanism is aimed at providing exchange of information
between public and private sectors regarding threats against critical infrastructure and
support of activity coordination in the event of damage or disturbance in functioning of critical
infrastructure. Significant element of the cooperation mechanism is the **Critical**
**Infrastructure Protection Forum. Its objective is to identify key issues within the scope of**
critical infrastructure protection and to develop solution proposals. Participants of the forum
are representatives of owners and holders of structures, installations and critical
infrastructure equipment as well as representatives of public administration.

Main activities

-  strengthening of the cooperation mechanism through intensifying working contacts of
the Government Security Centre with representatives appointed by the owners and
holders of structures, installations and critical infrastructure equipment – those should
be recognised as the so-called points of contact;

-  improvement of mechanisms of information exchange and cooperation between
public administration bodies, including services, formations and other entities
responsible for security and owners and holders of critical infrastructure systems;

-  working contacts between the representatives of public administration and the owners
and holders of structures, installations or critical infrastructure equipment shall be
directed at:

-  coordination support of actions undertaken by public administration, owners and

holders of structures, installations or critical infrastructure equipment in the event
of damage or disturbance in infrastructure functioning;

-  providing essential support (such as consultancy, training for operators) by public

administration entities within the scope of physical and information technology

95 Leading institution to develop and implement the _National Critical Infrastructure Protection Program_ is the
Government Security Centre.
96 Joint liability shall be understood as joint (shared) pursuit to improve security of critical infrastructure resulting
from joint sense of liability for infrastructure and awareness of its significance to functioning of society, economy
and in consequence - the state.


-----

protection of structures (entities such as the Internal Security Agency, the Police,
the Government Protection Bureau) and within the scope of functions of critical
infrastructure internal mechanisms protection and crisis management (the
Government Security Centre);

-  participation in exercises within the scope of critical infrastructure protection.

**3.1.3. Providing security of nuclear power system in Poland**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Nuclear facility (installation, power plant, waste depot of nuclear waste and spent nuclear
fuel, nuclear fuel cycle facilities and others) and occurring in those facilities processes and
close environment are subject to requirements of nuclear safety and radiation protection, as
well as to requirements of physical protection and safety.

Between physical protection of structures, nuclear materials and nuclear safety and radiation
protection must be synergy which shall result from the use of appropriate measures such as:
supervision and control within the scope of nuclear safety and radiation protection; design
rules; construction, start-up, operation and liquidation of nuclear facility; integrated
management system and nuclear materials transportation regulations. Those measures
should not collide with the nuclear safety norms. Physical protection includes prevention of
theft of nuclear materials and prevention of sabotage threats. In relation to nuclear power
plants it denotes securing them from ionising radiation release and from unauthorised
leakage of nuclear material, as well as emergency prevention and damage reduction.
Nuclear safety requirements at nuclear power plants have been considered of highest
importance since the beginning of commercial nuclear power engineering and very frequently
more important than economic considerations. Being aware of human unreliability and
fortuitous possible breakdowns of installations and nuclear devices, the rule of "in-depth
defence " was introduced. Its aim is to design the proper margin of safety, construct from the
best available materials in compliance with the highest quality type and performance, to
introduce new systems preventing from hazardous deflection of nominal operating
parameters and in the event of such deflection - prevention from failure expansion and
provision of safe automatic shutdown of a nuclear power station.

Main activities

-  for the Polish Nuclear Power Programme to be effective, secondary legislation to the
acts of law introducing the programme ought to be fully implemented;

-  revision of the valid nuclear law provides priority of the nuclear facilities security.
Therefore, it is necessary to enforce the execution of activities involving exposure to
ionising radiation upon compliance by the investor/operator of requirements of
nuclear safety, radiation protection, physical protection, security and emergency
response, as defined in the implementing regulations, separate regulations
and permits issued by the entity performing the nuclear supervision;

-  it is also necessary to monitor the alterations associated with the resolution of
problems of nuclear safety, including the European Commission conducted tests of
existing nuclear installations and properly apply their conclusions in _the Polish_
_Nuclear Power Programme;_

-  continuing the transformation of the National Atomic Energy Agency within the scope
of functioning of the Polish nuclear power.

**Re 3.2. Optimisation of strategic reserves system**

**3.2.1. Establishment of the strategic reserves system**
Description of the issue and justification for action

Since the entry into force of natural _the Act on Strategic Reserves[97], the classification of reserves_
and the regulations of functioning of the reserve system have been changed. The new law
introduces one type of reserves, which means that the already existing mobilisation reserves
designed for fulfilling defence and national security tasks, especially those that satisfied the
needs of the armed forces and their exclusive nature, would not function as a separate class
of reserves – they would become strategic reserves without dedication for individual
ministries.

Main activities

-  to continue the implementation of a modern system of strategic reserves based on
one type of reserves;

-  optimisation of the strategic reserve system will be aimed at improving its efficiency,
relevance, consistency, and coordination of activities.

**Objective 4**

**Increase of integration between public policies and the security policy**


The diagnosis of the national security system indicates the presence of numerous
interdependencies between national security and socio-economic development.

Simultaneously, the activities carried out in these areas are often characterised by
insufficient level of correlation and coordination which diminishes their efficiency and
cohesion. The aim of this strategy is therefore to increase the integration of public policies
with the security policy. The priorities and directions for intervention on the one hand present
activities of the security sector, especially defence, aimed at implementation of development
policy objectives, on the other hand, they show the possibility to use civil society potential for
security[98].

Priorities and directions of intervention for Objective 4 include:

**4.1. Integration of socio-economic development and national security**

4.1.1. Strengthening of relations between regional development of the country and defence
policy

4.1.2. Coordination of activities and procedures of spatial planning respecting requirements of
national defence and security

4.1.3. Support for infrastructure development provided by the security sector

4.1.4. Support for environmental protection provided by the security sector

4.1.5. Employment support and unemployment prevention in the security sector

4.1.6. Increasing the quality of education in security sector and integrating higher education of
security sector with national and European education systems

4.1.7 National heritage protection and development of cultural infrastructure
**4.2. Development of social dimension of national security**

97 The leading institution for development of the Governmental Programme of Strategic Reserves is the Ministry of
Economy.
98 Activity presented in this section refers to the contact strategy of national security and socio-economic
development, whereas other aspects of the identified areas of socio-economic development are included in the
remaining eight integrated development strategies

**Re 4.1. Integration of socio-economic development and national security**

**4.1.1. Strengthening of relations between regional development of the country and**

**defence policy**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Lack of mutual understanding, in regard to the needs of the defence sector within the
regional development of the state has resulted from lack of both relevant and unified
legislation within this scope and mutually defined interests and relations. National security
needs at the local level may often be perceived as a factor inhibiting development of a
region. Local communities are not aware of how important is functioning of the areas

natural

designated for realisation of national defence and security tasks until the garrisons are
decided to be removed. On the other hand, while locating defence investments, a possible
impact on development of a whole region is rarely taken into consideration what may result in
conflicts. Also the level of cooperation for revitalisation and re-cultivation of post-military
areas which require mutual cooperation of different ministries (i.a. the Ministry of National
Defence, the Ministry of Regional Development, he Ministry of Transport, Construction and
Maritime Economy, the Ministry of Environment) and public administration units, seems to be
insufficient. Works on integrated development strategies, conducted by the government, go
towards fixing this situation. _The_ _National Strategy for Regional Development 2010-2020_
_Regions - Towns - Rural Areas (NSRD) [PL. Krajowa Strategia Rozwoju Regionalnego 2010-_
_2020][99]and this strategy present activities aimed at increasing coordination of defence and_
regional policies.

99 The NSRD suggests i.a. support of comprehensive revitalisation programmes (direction of activities 2.3
Restructuring and revitalisation of towns and other areas that lose their social and economic functions).


-----

Main activities

-  obtaining expert opinions on mutual relations between regional development of the
state and defence policy (i.a. within the scope of impact of military units disposition on
social and economic development of regions), and taking advantage of conclusions
arising from such expert opinions;

-  appointing an inter-ministerial team responsible for proposals within the subject area
and implementing its recommendations;

-  increasing the contribution of the Ministry of National Defence to the process of
preparing development strategy for provinces;

-  participation of representatives of the Military Property Agency in designing selected
comprehensive revitalisation programmes.

**4.1.2. Coordination of activities and procedures of spatial planning respecting**

**requirements of national defence and security**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Because of the need to provide appropriate conditions for carrying out the defence tasks and
the need to provide the spatial order, areas designated for national defence and security
require integration of their space with the surrounding area. Therefore, it is necessary to
establish in planning standards of spatial development the buffer zones around them which
will require the appropriate reflection in local spatial development plans. On the one hand
these zones must safeguard defence functions of these areas, on the other hand, as far as
possible, use their features for proper development of the area surrounding them. This
requires proper coordination of spatial development between the competent authorities of the
security sector and the relevant local authorities.

Main activities

-  creating formal and legal conditions for appropriate coordination of activities within
the scope of spatial development on the area which surrounds the confined space
(including protection zones and limited use areas);

-  coordinating spatial policy in a way to ensure protection of fundamental function of
confined space related to defence and national security, and simultaneously to use
features of confined space in development of a region;

-  initiating legislative actions aimed at improving procedures concerning national
defence needs, particularly within the scope of establishing protection zones for
confined space and location of investment of defence significance, i.a. indicating
coordination of these activities in the process of spatial planning.

**4.1.3 Support for infrastructure development provided by the security sector**

Description of the issue and justification for action

If possible, it is necessary to aim towards joint use of infrastructure for defence and national
security purposes and region development, i.a. by co-using military airports, sports & leisure
facilities or joint investments in environment, e.g. sewage treatment plants.

Main activities

-  using military airports or parts of them in order to establish or extend a local, regional
or national civil airport of public use or a civil landing ground, under _the Act of 30[th]_
_May 1996 on the Management of Certain Assets of the State Treasury and on the_
Military Property Agency[100];

100 Journal of Laws of 2004, no. 163 item 1711, as amended


-----

-  implementation of the provisions of the _Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure as_
_of 15[th] November 2004 on Conditions and Principles for Use of Military Airports by_
_Civil Aviation and on Responsibilities of Persons Managing Such Airports[101];_

-  implementation of the provisions of the Act of 21[st] August 1997 on Property
_Management[102];_

-  integration of infrastructural military networks with civil networks, especially with water
and sewer one;

-  aiming, if possible, at joint use of infrastructure for defence and national security
purposes as well as for a region, e.g. sports & leisure facilities, cultural centres.

**4.1.4. Support for environmental protection provided by the security sector**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Support for environmental protection as well as initiating actions for water management by
the security sector result from the necessity of mitigating the effects of functioning of
infrastructure within this sector, in particular the effects of functioning of military facilities
upon the area. It is necessary to continue the activities aimed at maximum use of technology
and environmentally friendly solutions, and to meet the minimum standards of the EU
within the scope of air protection, protection against noise and vibrations, waste
management, providing drinking water of high quality, re-cultivation of degraded land, flood
prevention and increasing forest resources as well.

Main activities

-  promoting environmentally friendly solutions within the investment activities of the
Ministry of National Defence;

-  participating in the process of planning and establishing Natura 2000 [ENG. Nature
_2000], the European Ecological Network and in the process of designing a plan of_
protection tasks and of protection of Natura 2000 areas;

-  respecting the requirements for protection of plants and animals in planning and
organising military exercises;

-  modernising liquid fuel stations and bases and also sewage treatment plants used by
the Polish Armed Forces;

-  removing and neutralising asbestos, replacing ozone-depleting substances with
alternative and environmentally friendly ones.

**4.1.5. Employment support and unemployment prevention in the security sector**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Assistance in employment support, just like other privileges resulting from the performance of
professional military service, increases attractiveness of this occupation. These activities
help soldiers to leave the military labour market and enter the civilian one, what significantly
reduces the risk of economic inactivity and negative effects resulting from unemployment. At
the same time, while the economic situation in Poland is still changing, the army will have to
compete on the labour market with other employers to provide the Polish Armed Forces with
necessary specialists and offer the incentives for employment. One of such incentives is the
opportunity to raise or change professional qualifications thanks to the assistance from the
Ministry of National Defence provided to maintain professional activity during the service and
after its termination[103].

101 Journal od Laws, no. 254 item 2552.
102 Journal of Laws of 2010, no. 102 item 651, as amended
103 Some of the aforementioned solutions could be amended due to the alterations in uniform service pensions.


-----

Main activities

-  military conversion for all professional soldiers;

-  phased military conversion - from career counselling, through retraining, traineeship
programmes and job placement, to the employment itself;

-  making career counselling available for contract soldiers after 3 years of service - this
solution will allow to plan individual career paths during the service, what is especially
important in case when soldiers are military specialists whose areas of expertise are
rare on the civil labour market;

-  making retraining available for soldiers 2 years before planned retirement and 2 years
after retirement;

-  applying gradation of the amount of financial assistance depending on duration of
military service.

**4.1.6. Increasing the quality of security sector education and integrating higher**

**education of security sector with national and European education systems**

Description of the issue and justification for action

The mission of military higher education assumes training and constant improvement of
professionalism of military and civil human resources in order to face contemporary and
future challenges for national and international security; this is a key element that shapes the
quality of the officer corps of the Polish Armed Forces. Realisation of the main assumptions
of the Bologna Declaration made military universities part of the national and European
education system. However, the military education, especially training and professional
development of privates and non-commissioned officers has not been fully integrated with
that national education system.

Involvement of the Ministry of National Defence in works aimed at restructuring the national
education system based on _the Polish Qualification Framework is particularly important for_
the development of the Polish Armed Forces and expectations of candidates for military
service related to improvement of professional skills and acquisition of new ones, recognised
on the civil labour market, during the service, as well as certifying skills acquired in a nonformalised way. Tailoring military skills to civilian occupations will result in increased
attractiveness of military service, will improve the image of a reserve soldier on the labour
market and will increase the level of confidence in the quality of qualifications acquired in the
Polish Armed Forces.

Main activities

-  improvement of design of education tasks in order to provide accuracy and stability of
the needs of the army and to make education more practical;

-  continuation of development of the effective evaluation system used by the Polish
Armed Forces to assess usefulness and efficiency of the actions adopted and
undertaken by universities, regarding the assumed and agreed educational goals;

-  expanding the role of universities as the laboratory and expert background of the
Ministry of National Defence in the process of identification of operational needs,
development of doctrines concerning the contemporary battlefield and gaining new
defensive capabilities;

-  subordinating the activities of military universities to the common rules of education,
professional development and scientific research, in accordance with the national and
international tendencies, in particular with the assumptions of the Bologna Process,
including the adaptation of the educational system to the requirements of the National
Qualification Framework;


-----

-  strengthening the position of the leading scientific institutions within the scope of
defence techniques and technologies, and within the scope of national security and
defence, aimed at the needs of the national economy, including the needs of the
Polish Armed Forces as the priority;

-  increasing the activity in the international military cooperation, i.a. through
development of the education offering for foreigners, including soldiers, within studies
and other forms of further education.

**4.1.7. National heritage protection and development of cultural infrastructure**

Description of the issue and justification for action

An important element of shaping national identity through activity of national and military
museums is promotion of the tradition and the history of the Polish army. Such promotion
aims towards satisfying the needs of young generation to discover historical roots and
making people aware of the continuity of history, generations and territory of the Republic of
Poland. The need of popularisation of the idea of defence in the context of
professionalisation of the Polish Armed Forces, as well as an intensified interest in history of
the Polish army and the contemporary Polish Armed Forces justify the necessity of
implementation of system solutions regarding operating of military museums, including
establishment of new museums. All the more that the collections of great historical
importance gathered in the halls of tradition are poorly available (they are located within
military bases) and dispersed. Moreover, they lack common and nationwide information on
their content and cannot be digitalised in order to be published in Internet. Therefore, it is
necessary to take actions aimed at gathering, stocktaking and digitalisation of the collections
of history of the Polish army. These activities will allow for making the collections available to
the whole society, as well as for promotion of the Polish military service history. They will
also facilitate international contacts, cooperation and exchange of exhibits.

Main activities

-  institutional and organisational restructuring of military museums which involves
implementation of _the_ _Concept of Development of Military Museums in 2009-2018,_
adopted in 2009 which provides for the Polish Army Museum as the main
programming centre and 3 force services museums;

-  improvement of infrastructure of military museums;

-  creating formal and legal conditions for acquisition of financial resources out of the
budget of the Ministry of National Defence, for investment and statutory activities of
museums;

-  extending the educational offering of military museums and improving its quality.

**Re 4.2. Development of social dimension of national security**

**4.2.1. Development of civil support for the Polish Armed Forces**

Description of the issue and justification for action

The society is one of the fundamental resources on which the organisation of national
security is based. Building active society in regard to national defence is based on planning,
coordination and monitoring of cooperation of the Ministry of National Defence with nongovernmental organisations and other social partners, including schools, universities,
museums, local government authorities and church organisations. Especially in case of full
professionalisation of the Polish Armed Forces and concurrent social events, it is necessary
to engage non-governmental organisations and other social partners in actions aimed at
acquiring and improving defence skills of all citizens.


-----

Main activities

-  planning, organisational and logistics support of activities of social partners, aimed at
national defence through different forms of assistance for non-governmental sector
and through providing social partners with tools which allow to conduct their own
activities in the field of defence;

-  increasing the activity of citizens in defence and patriotic education, especially in
promoting modern forms of defence education (preparing the youth for the
professional military service);

-  inspiring social partners to promote knowledge of defence duties of citizens;

-  keeping good relations with war veterans, veterans who took part in overseas
missions and with former soldiers;

-  support of associations representing soldiers of reserves in international
organisations and undertakings

Support for defence education of society should be provided by improving the existing forms
of cooperation with social partners and initiating new ones, i.a. through:

-  subcontracting public tasks in the field of national defence and the Polish Armed
Forces' activities to non-governmental organisations;

-  providing social partners with logistics support through gratuitous transfer of movable
property of the State Treasury considered to be not necessary to the Polish Armed
Forces;

-  providing logistics and organisational assistance to social partners in undertakings in
the field of defence;

-  concluding and performing agreements for cooperation with different social entities,
particularly with non-governmental organisations, local government authorities and
schools which run innovative and extended security education programmes;

-  supervision of foundations which have indicated the Minister of National Defence as
"the relevant minister" due to their statutory goals in the field of defence and due to
the scope of activities of the said minister.

**4.2.2. Development of social capital for security purposes**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Participation of non-governmental organisations in activities related to ensuring national
security is constantly increasing. Government administration and local government bodies
may help crisis-affected people more efficiently and more effectively, provided that they are
professionally supported by the third sector. Efficiency of government organisations (the
armed forces, the Police, guards, inspectorates) mostly depends on proper specialist support
from non-governmental organisations being capable of helping in different areas of national
security on a par with government bodies. Non-governmental organisations are capable of
social monitoring of non-military threats, especially in the field of detection, warning and
alerting. Preparation of the non-governmental sector in case of disasters denotes
preparedness to predict, prevent from, mitigate and cope with effects of the threats or
disasters.

Main activities

-  development of cooperation with non-governmental organisations for increasing
involvement of the non-governmental sector in public administration activities in the
field of national security;

-  creating, together with the non-governmental sector, a list of possible threats which
may occur on the activity area of a given organisation and methods of protection
against them.

**Objective 5**

### Objective 5. Creation of conditions for development of the integrated Creation of conditions for development of the integrated national security system

As it has been presented in the diagnostic part of the strategy, the complexity and dynamics
of changes in the security environment force development and unification of the sphere of
national security. Public authorities possess a duty to establish legal and organisational
conditions which will make national security system a coherent, integrated and properly
working mechanism. It is particularly important to initiate integration processes in the field of
national security management because the organisation and operation of this field are not
perfect. It is necessary to take all the efforts to develop coherent mechanisms of coordination
and cooperation of the entities operating in the area of national security and to ensure that
their activities have an appropriate level of security of information and telecommunications.
Objective 5 will require close cooperation between the most important bodies of national
executive authority.

**5.1. Improvement of the national security management system**

**5.1.1. Determining a role of the Government Security Centre in the national security**

**system**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Currently, under Art. 11 of _the_ _Crisis Management Act, the Government Security Centre_
performs numerous tasks related to crisis management, including supporting the Council of
Ministers, the Prime Minister, Government Crisis Management Team or the relevant minister
of internal affairs. The Government Security Centre is also responsible for civil planning,
coordinates preparation of _the_ _Report on National Security Threats, cooperates with_
organisational entities, sections and units of NATO and the EU, as well as other international
organisations responsible for crisis management and critical infrastructure protection,
cooperates with the head of the Internal Security Agency in the scope of prevention,
neutralisation and elimination of effects of the events of terrorism. The Centre informs the
European Commission and Member States of the EU about measures taken in a crisis
situation in order to properly secure the public telecommunication network and broadcasting
and receiving stations used to provide safety in the field of communication systems and data
communication systems.

With numerous assignments, the currently adopted legal and organisational solutions do not
allow to precisely determine the position of the Government Security Centre in the
administration structure and its role in the national security system. The _Crisis Management_
_Act defines the Government Security Centre as a state budget unit subordinated to the Prime_
Minister.

Main activities

-  redefining and specifying the role of the Government Security Centre in the national
security system by legal means.

**5.1.2. Improvement of cooperation of organisational structures relevant to crisis**

**management and defence reaction matters operating in time of peace, crisis**
**and war**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Having regard to operating of the national security system, there is assumed complexity and
cohesion of actions undertaken in order to effectively face any threats. There is also
assumed effective integration of military potential with administration, economy and society.
As no element of the national security system is capable of performing tasks related to
national security individually, this requires cooperation of organisational structures relevant to
crisis management and defence response which operate in time of peace, crisis and war, at
each level of management. The principles of cooperation shall be precise, comprehensive,
perpetual, flexible and consistent.

In _the_ _Crisis Management Act, there were indicated and appointed the relevant_
organisational entities and structures of central (government and ministerial level) and local
(provincial level) levels, responsible for performing tasks related to crisis management.[104]
These structures have to operate and carry out the aforementioned assignments in every
possible crisis situation, including an increased defence readiness condition in the state and
a relevant state of emergency.

104 The issue of improvement of crisis management is elaborated on in the _Efficient State strategy._


-----

In the Crisis Management _Act it is assumed that organisational structures established under_
_the Crisis Management Act will be a part of the organisational structures of a particular_
management post of public administration bodies. This complies with the principle of
avoidance of copying solutions in the field of national security management, separately for a
crisis situation and for external national security threats. Therefore, it is necessary to
increase the level of integration of existing structures and structures planned to be
established. The aforementioned requirements regarding improvement of cooperation have
to be applied at national, provincial and local-government level.

Main activities

-  it is necessary to improve the principles of cooperation in the field of national security
management through adopting coherent solutions and improving cooperation
mechanisms at all organisational levels of the state;

-  precise assignment of tasks to all the participants and establishment of rules of
cooperation within the national security management system will require adaptation of
legal regulations.

**5.2. Development of mechanisms of coordination and cooperation of authorities,**

**entities and organisational structures of the national security system,**
**including the armed forces**


**5.2.1 Actions undertaken to provide cohesion of processes of defence planning and**

**crisis management**

Description of the issue and justification for action natural

Tasks and functions assigned to the Government Crisis Management Team and the
Government Security Centre under the Crisis Management Act are not limited to problems
related to occurrence of a crisis situation. In accordance with the Act, crisis management is
an element of national security management which operates during states of emergency and
during war as well. This relates in particular to:

-  tasks performed within the scope of civil planning and relating to a period of time after

introduction of states of emergency and during war;

-  support for the activities of the Polish Armed Forces and allied armies through non
military defensive structures during an external threat to national security and during
war;

-  substantive content of crisis management plans which defines crisis management

procedures during states of emergency and war.

Hence, it is necessary to ensure cohesion of the existing solutions in crisis management and
defence response. The aforementioned actions should apply mainly to the planning sphere
which comprises planning of actions to be taken during the raising of national defence
readiness and in the event of states of emergency. It is also necessary to develop methods
of security planning, common for defence planning and crisis management based on the
uniform evaluation of national security threats and joint planning procedures. Uniform
principles and procedures of national security planning will improve efficiency of national
security management and will ensure better use of forces and resources for the purpose of
national security and defence.

Main activities

-  providing cohesion and identity of actions described in the _Defence Reaction Plan of_
_the Republic of Poland, operational plan of use of the Polish Armed Forces,_ _the_
_National Plan for Crisis Management and of undertakings described in the_ _Manual of_
_Undertakings and Procedures of the Crisis Management System, as well as in the_

plans and documents prepared at lower levels of public administration and by
entrepreneurs.

**5.2.2. Intensification of monitoring and assessment of development/integration of the**

**national security system, i.a. through periodical, strategic reviews of national**
**security**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Changes taking place in contemporary security environment extort the need for a
comprehensive look at all aspects going beyond the traditional perception of national security
through the prism of defence. In this regard, a very useful tool, and of increasing use by other
countries, is a comprehensive review of national security. The Strategic Review of National
Security (SPBN)[105] in Poland was initiated by the President of the Republic of Poland in
2010. The purpose of the review was to make a diagnosis and prognosis of developments in
key areas of Polish security over the years. The Strategic Review of National Security is the
necessary element of the idea of integrated approach to security and ought to be performed
in a cyclic way.

_The_ _Act on Crisis Management and the_ _Regulation of Council of Ministers on the Report on_
_the Threats to National Security provide a mechanism for cyclic review of national security. It_
is implemented by ministers, heads of central agencies and provincial governors through
drawing up every two years a report on threats to national security. The process is
coordinated by the Government Security Centre. The report defines the key threats to
national security and courses of action aimed at counteracting these threats. The report on
national security threats will constitute, next to the Strategic Review of National Security, the
basis of monitoring process and evaluation of the national security system.

Main activities

-  SPBN results, summarised in the form of the SPBN Report, will be a significant help
in arriving at decisions related to national security. They will be used to update _the_
_National Security Strategy of the Republic of Poland and the_ _Strategy of Development_
_of the National Security System of the Republic of Poland;_

-  on the basis of the SPBN Report, the _National Security White Paper will be published,_
informing the public about the current state of security and the proposed path of
government action in this area. In addition, publication of this document should help
to initiate a public debate on national security of Poland.


**Re 5.3. Provision of the security of information and telecommunications in the**

**context of the integrated national security system**

**5.3.1. Increase of the security level of IT resources of public and state administration,**
**including protection against Internet threats and terrorism**

natural

Description of the issue and justification for action
Cyber-terrorism is currently one of the major threats to ICT security of states, including
Poland. It results from the increasing number of Internet users, small costs of a cyberterrorist attack as well as possibility to preserve anonymity of persons or entities responsible
for it. In order to increase the degree of ICT protection against the Internet threats, there are
necessary comprehensive and coordinated activities of all government entities which through
carrying out a risk analysis will implement safeguards appropriate to the likelihood of threats.
A coordinated action appropriate to the risks of all government entities will enable a radical

105 Order No. 4 of the President of the Republic of Poland of November 24, 2010 on the conduct of the Strategic

Review of National Security.


-----

increase in the degree of protection including minimisation of costs. Proper activity will also
be undertaken in response to the risks associated with cyber-intelligence.
Main activities

-  adoption of Cyberspace Protection Policy of the Republic of Poland[106]

-  strengthening of coordination and cooperation at the national level thanks to activities
of the Committee of the Council of Ministers for Digitisation;

-  increase of coverage of the ARAKIS.GOV[107] system through implementation of the
system into all offices and state institutions;

-  conducting of scientific works in the field of computer emergency response within the
scope of the Information Management Security System.

**5.3.2. Development of the Computer Emergency Response System**

Description of the issue and justification for action

The dynamic development of ICT networks of the Ministry of National Defence of different
clauses and their more extensive use for data transfer, as well as for command and control,
necessitated the provision of security for these networks and for information they send. Thus,
there was established - in analogy to CERT.GOV.PL functioning for government
administration in the civil sphere – the Computer Emergency Response System [PL.. System
_Reagowania na Incydenty Komputerowe (SRniK)][108], which main objective is to provide_
implementation and coordination of prevention, detection and response to computer
emergencies for ICT systems and networks of the Ministry of National Defence as well as
cooperation in the field of cyber-attacks prevention with the Government Computer
Emergency Response Team CERT.GOV.PL and CERT-POLAND.
Increase of threats in cyberspace requires customisation and continuous development of
existing structures of the response system. Therefore, one of the main assignments in the
coming years will be continuation of the upgrading process established under SRnIK MILCERT team and acquisition of new competence to implement technologically advanced
features, including computer forensics and active response to cyber-attacks. This will be
pursued in a manner associated with the development of the Government Computer
Emergency Response Team and building of strategic coordination competence of the
Ministry of Administration and Digitisation, appropriate for communication and

computerisation departments.

Main activities

-  further expansion of collaboration with other national teams and international
organisations, consolidation of the structure of CERT, including the newly established
EU CERT;

-  establishment of the National Computer Emergency Response System enabling a
fast response to threats from Internet;

-  possession of strong, equipped with advanced technologies, computer emergency
response teams (including Rapid Reaction Team) by the Internal Security Agency
and the Ministry of National Defence will facilitate implementation of international
cooperation and will acquire new operational abilities within the scope of assignments
to respond to computer security incidents and to command and control in cyberspace.

**5.3.3. Development of the Government Communications Network**

Description of the issue and justification for action

Entities involved in the process of national security management require enhanced security
of communication systems and IT support. To provide information protection against
unauthorised disclosure during phone calls and video conferencing as well as during data
transmission, in particular against the loss of confidentiality, availability and integrity, there
will be developed the Government Communications Network [PL. Sieć Łączności Rządowej
_(SŁR)]. It will provide a link between authorised persons in the event of emergencies._

SŁR plays a significant part in providing separate communications for Chancellery of the
President of the Republic of Poland, Chancelleries of the Sejm and the Senate, government
and other entities, both in current operations, as well as in emergency situations. It is a
telecommunications network that provides telecommunication services, in particular voice
communication, video conferencing, based on data transmission and other services within
the defined needs. Its operational range includes provincial cities and Warsaw
agglomeration.

Currently, the Internal Security Agency has been carrying out the process of modernisation
and construction of classified SŁR system which enables processing of classified information
up to ‘CONFIDEN IAL’ clause inclusively. In addition, since 2011, the new mobile
confidential communication system includes more than 2000 stations (equipped with phones
or laptops) and provides a 24h separate, secure, encrypted communication between persons
most important for national security - including the President, the Prime Minister, ministers,
heads of services and their local units.

Main activities

-  modernisation of SŁR through fixing approximately 140 encrypted telephone devices,
both in the SŁR central network, as well as in provincial zone and through migration
to the modern technology used in the mobile part;

-  further development of the SŁR classified mobile system, i.a. for applications
dedicated to the Ministry of National Defence;

-  target SŁR migration to IP technology (Internet Protocol).

## V. Financial framework of the strategy

In compliance with Article 14d of _the Act of December 6, 2006 on the Principles of the_
_Development Policy[109], the principles of the long-term financing of the development policy_
implementation are determined by the regulations on public finance. Pursuant to Article 136,
section 1 and 2 of _the Act of August 27, 2009 on Public Finance[110] the budget act may_
determine, within the scope of expense limits for a financial year, the expense limits for longterm programmes, whereas section 2 determines that long-term programmes are
established by the Council of Ministers in order to implement the strategies adopted by the
Council of Ministers.

Through the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 71 of 8[th] May 2012, published in the
Official Journal of the Republic of Poland [PL. Monitor Polski], item 292, _the Long-term_
_Financial Plan for 2012-2015 [PL. Wieloletni Plan Finansowy Państwa na lata 2012-2015_
_(WPFP)] was passed. The fundamental role of this plan in the Polish public finance system_
consists in associating the directions of spending the budget assets with the state’s
objectives defined in the strategic documents. In compliance with the regulations of the
Public Finance Act, WPFP is a document being drawn up in the format encompassing the
state’s functions.

Planning the scale of expenses for the particular functions within the scope of WPFP and
determining the primary objectives of the performance structure of the state’s budget,
enables to translate these amounts or limits for particular objectives, areas or programmes
resulting from the development strategies. According to the proposal of allocating the budget
tasks to the development strategies, _the_ _Strategy of Development of the National Security_
_System of the Republic of Poland 2022 is financed within the scope of two permanent state’s_
functions: function 11. - external security and border integrity; function 15. - foreign policy[111].

_Source: own material based on the project of the Planning and Programming Methodology of the_
_Polish Armed Forces Development for 2013-2022 (in the area of function 11) – as of 23[rd] March 2011)_
_and on the document by the Ministry of Finance No. RF-3/199/SJI/2010/307 of May 24, 2010._

109 Journal of Laws of 2009, No. 84, item 712, as amended.
110 Journal of Laws, No. 157, item 1240, as amended.
111 _The_ _Resolution of the Council of Ministers No. 71 of May 8, 2012,_ regarding the update of the Long-term

_Financial Plan for 2012-2015 (Official Journal of the Republic of Poland of 2012, item 292)._


-----

In compliance with WPFP, function 11 comprises state’s area responsible for state’s defence
and the Polish Armed Forces, and also Poland’s participation in military undertakings of
international organisations and in the scope of fulfilling military obligations resulting from
international agreements.

Financing of the assignments in the scope of defence, resulting from _the_ _Strategy of_
_Development of the National Security System of the Republic of Poland 2022, will be_
pursued with the use of assets from the government budget, supported by the assets from
_the_ _Armed Forces Modernisation Fund. The development programmes will constitute the_
documents implementing decisions of SRSBN RP with fundamental assumptions for division
of the assets for particular objectives defined in the strategy, especially: _the_ _Development_
_Programme of the Polish Armed Forces for 2013-2022, the Non-military Defence_
_Preparation Programme for 2013-2022 and the Economy Mobilisation Programme for 2013-_
_2022._

Financial framework for carrying out the aforementioned programmes will be defined in
WPFP for 4-year-periods updated annually with simultaneous extension of the planning
horizon for a year.

In turn, function 15 comprises i.a. representation and protection of Polish interests abroad,
acting for the benefit of world peace, democracy, world development and development of a
positive image of Poland in the world which are financed by the promotion activities. The
activities for coordination of foreign policy of the Republic of Poland will be realised
concurrently.

In compliance with macroeconomic forecasts, adopted in the _National Development Strategy_
_2020, it is assumed that the scope of public financial assets allocated for development_
objectives of the _Strategy of Development of the National Security System of the Republic of_
_Poland will amount, according to COFOG classification, to PLN 1.2 billion. The forecasted_
assets include only the expenditure for R&D. Whereas, the expenses defined in the financial
framework of SRSBN RP encompass also other expenses provided for carrying out the
directions of interventions applying to the state’s defence needs, for financing of which,
under the applicable law, no less than 1.95% of GDP from the previous year should be
allocated annually[112].

The amount of expenditure for implementation of SRSBN RP in the entire realisation period
of the strategy (from 2022 onwards) will be to a great extent dependent on the state’s
economic situation.

112 _The Act of May 25, 2001 on Reconstruction, Technical Modernisation and Financing of the Armed Forces of_
_the Republic of Poland (Journal of Laws of 2009, No. 67, item 570, as amended.)_
