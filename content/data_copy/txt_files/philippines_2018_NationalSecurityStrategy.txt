######     MESSAGE

 In the past decades, the concept of national security has dramatically evolved from its traditional focus on territorial defense and governmental survival to the promotion of economic development and the preservation of natural resources. Guided by this shift, we crafted the National Security Strategy that articulates our roadmap in building a stronger nation. In order to protect our most cherished democratic institutions and way of life, we will create an environment where peace and economic development will complement each other. We will address urgent national security concerns and cope with the rapidly changing regional and global security environment in line with the objectives set forth in the National Security Policy 2017-2022. To defend our sovereignty and the integrity of our national territory, we will continue to develop and improve our defense, intelligence and law enforcement capabilities to enable our troops to end communist insurgency, terrorism and violent extremism. We will also bolster our position in the community of nations by strengthening diplomatic relations with our traditional allies, engaging non-traditional partners and pursuing an independent foreign policy that gives primacy to our national interest. These endeavors will be sustained by a medium-term socio-economic agenda that aims to lessen the tax burden on the poor, reduce income inequality and improve the quality and accessibility of education and healthcare. We have also embarked on an ambitious infrastructure development program that will pave the way for rapid industrialization and modernization, thereby making our country the next top investment destination in the Asia Pacific Region. I call upon our people to stand behind our national security apparatus in carrying out this National Security Strategy that will strengthen the foundations of a secure, peaceful, modern and prosperous Philippines.

###### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


###### he leadership of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte affirms its commitment to deliver a more

### T

###### s e c u r e, s t a b l e, j u s t a n d prosperous future for the people of the Philippines. To translate this vision into reality, the Duterte Administration promulgated in April 2017 the National Security Policy (NSP) 2017-2022: For Change and Well-Being of the Filipino People. Subsequently, the NSP became the precursor as well as formed the basis for the development of this National Security Strategy (NSS), which in essence articulates in operational terms the policies set forth in the NSP. 

 This NSS is the Philippines’ first such official publication and follows the NSP’s overarching principle that national security and economic development are closely intertwined and mutually reinforcing concepts. As in the NSP, the NSS has the broad theme of bringing about meaningful and lasting socio- economic and political change aimed at building a stronger nation and improving the lives of the majority of the Filipino people. The NSS outlines the ways and


###### means to attain the national security vision, which the NSP states as: ““A safe and secure Philippines, at peace with itself and its neighbors, where its citizens are allowed to reach their full potential through the promotion of social justice and harmony, political stability, sound environmental management, and economic progress.”

 The NSS integrates the State’s major security policies, goals, responsibilities and courses of action into a roadmap or blueprint for the fulfillment of the national security vision. It seeks to foster better coordination, synchronization and cohesion of government functions in order to improve efficiency and maximize the use of limited State resources. The NSS also serves as an important vehicle to articulate the national interest, convey the State’s intentions, and rally public support for government policies and programs. The support of Congress in particular will be crucial to the success of the NSS in terms of enacting the necessary legislations related to national security a n d a p p r o p r i a t i n g t h e i r f i s c a l requirements. 


-----

###### The NSS has seven parts. Chapter One introduces the concept of national security and the overarching national security framework in which the NSP and NSS are shown as two inseparable components. Chapter Two provides an overview of the current strategic environment. It highlights the State’s national security priorities in light of the various internal and external threats and challenges it seeks to address. Chapter Three  discusses the  national security framework, core values and national interests underpinning the NSS. It begins with the definition of national security as “the state or condition wherein the nation’s sovereignty and territorial integrity; the people’s well-being, core values, and way of life; and the State and its institutions; are protected and enhanced.” 

 The Chapter ends with the following 12-point national security goals as basis for the strategic actions of concerned government agencies and departments, namely: 

 • Guarantee public safety and achieve good governance.

 • Mitigate the impact of health related threats. 

 • Develop a dynamic, inclusive, and sustainable economy.



###### • Achieve food and water security.

 • Safeguard and preserve national sovereignty and territorial integrity.

 • Heighten consciousness and pride on Filipino heritage, culture and values.

 • Promote human and ecological security.

 • Achieve energy security.

 • Ensure maritime and airspace security.

 • Strengthen international relations.

 • Provide strong cyber infrastructure and cyber security.

 • Improve vital transportation infrastructure and port security.

 Chapter Four introduces two important components that will guide the strategy’s successful and sustained implementation. First is the combined, balanced and effective use of the instruments of national power, namely: political and legal, diplomatic, informational, intelligence, economic, and military and law enforcement. This c o m p o n e n t a i m s t o p r o m o t e comprehensiveness and shared efforts in addressing current and future threats. Second is wealth creation and resource generation through intensified human


-----

###### capital development, passage of national security legislations, appropriate funding for national security, and development of strategic industries. 

 Meanwhile, the attainment of the 12-point national security agenda hinges on the successful execution of the strategic lines of action enumerated in Chapter Five. The action areas are designed to improve our defences, our capabilities, our technologies, our processes, our partnerships, and our resources. A total of 109 strategic lines of action were identified following a careful analysis of the various threats and challenges as well as opportunities that are commensurate to the strengths and potentials of the nation. 

 The successful execution of these strategic lines of action is largely dependent on the effectiveness and cohesiveness of the national security sector. In this regard, the NSS endeavors to reinvigorate and streamline the existing national security structure to ensure a more effective command and control and a more cost-effective utilization of government resources and manpower. Crucial to this effort is the need to revitalize the organizational structures of the National Security Council and its Secretariat; the Cabinet Cluster on Security, Justice and Peace; the National


###### Intelligence Board and the National Intelligence Committee. 

 The NSS concludes with a call for unity among all sectors of Philippine society --- that we all have a part to play: government, business and the general public. The NSS process is still in its nascent stage and should be treated as a work in progress. But hopefully, this NSS will set the stage for the formation of national consensus and national will toward the achievement of lasting peace and prosperity across the country. To this end, the support and cooperation of the Filipino people are paramount.

 c h a l l e n g e s f a c i n g t h e

 Philippines is more complex

 today than in the past. These


###### challenges include decades old internal

 insurgencies that have hampered

 development and kept the nation in a

 state of low-level but debilitating

 conflict. The Mindanao conflict, in

 particular, has assumed a more complex

 and menacing form in recent years,

 triggered by the internal splintering in

 the Moro movement and further fueled

 by Islamic State-inspired radicalism. 

 The five-month-long siege in

 Marawi reflected this dangerous mix.

 While important peace inroads have

 been forged with the country’s largest

 non-state armed rebel groups, the quest

 for enduring peace in Mindanao

 remains elusive unless the smaller but

 decidedly more violent remnant and

 extremist factions are ultimately

 defeated. 


###### “NATIONAL SECURITY IS

 NOW EQUATED NOT ONLY

 TO THE TRADITIONAL

 NOTIONS OF NATIONAL

 DEFENSE AND REGIME

 SURVIVAL, BUT ALSO TO

 THE OVERALL WELL-BEING

 OF THE CITIZENS, THE

 PROMOTION OF ECONOMIC

 DEVELOPMENT, AND THE

 PROTECTION OF THE

 E N V I R O N M E N T A N D

 NATURAL RESOURCES.”


-----

###### Similarly, the Philippines’ current

 external security environment is marked

 b y i n c r e a s e d u n c e r t a i n t y a n d

 unpredictability. Rising tensions in the

 South China Sea, which nestles the West

 Philippine Sea, have brought to the fore a

 changing security backdrop in the Asia
 Pacific region. This has prompted the

 Philippines, which has not confronted any

 external armed threat since it gained full

 independence in 1946, to suddenly give

 the same attention to territorial defense as

 it does to internal security threats. 

 Since the turn of the millennium,

 the Filipino people’s understanding of the

 concept of national security itself has

 changed dramatically. It is now equated

 not only to the traditional notions of

 national defense and regime survival, but

 also to the overall well-being of the

 citizens, the promotion of economic

 development, and the protection of the

 environment and natural resources. 

 More and more, the new outlook

 links security to broad political and social

 concerns, from governance issues, such as


###### graft and corruption, to various other

 problems besetting much of the

 developing world including the

 Philippines – i.e., poverty and lopsided

 development, high crime rate, climate

 change and environmental degradation,

 spread of infectious diseases, and trans
 border threats such as human and drug

 trafficking, cybercrime, and money

 laundering. 

 The above challenges call for a

 robust, dynamic and pro-active national

 security framework and infrastructure,

 capable of dealing with these growing

 threats in real time. 

 The development of a national

 security framework aims to ensure that the

 country’s “sovereignty, territorial

 integrity, national interests, and the well
 being of its people and institutions are

 preserved, protected and enhanced.” 

 It serves as a roadmap that guides

 the State working together with civil

 society and its leaders in setting vital

 national goals and objectives and the

 means to achieve these. 


-----

###### Central to the national security

 framework are two inseparable

 components: the National Security Policy

 (NSP) and the National Security Strategy

 (NSS). While the NSP articulates the

 domestic and global interests of the

 Philippines that are vital to national

 security, the NSS lays down the

 a p p r o a c h e s a n d r e s o u r c e s f o r

 implementing the NSP with a view to

 guarantee the security of the State and its

 people in a dynamic and constantly

 changing security environment. 

 As an extension of the NSP, the

 NSS articulates in operational terms the

 process of pursuing the national security

 agenda. This document attempts to fill the

 remaining gap in the country’s national

 security paradigm – a problem that had

 often forced our security planners and

 managers in the past to adopt an ad hoc

 and short-sighted outlook, rather than a

 pro-active and forward-looking one. 


###### Undeniably, the evolution of a

 national security framework has been a

 long and fragmented process in the

 Philippines. In fact, it was only in 2011

 that the first official publication of the

 NSP came out. The incumbent

 administration of President Rodrigo R.

 Duterte published its own NSP report in

 April 2017. Successive NSP documents

 reflect progress in terms of defining the

 country’s policy framework, but still did

 not  address the need for a clear-cut

 National Security Strategy. 

 In developing this NSS, the views

 of relevant government and non
 government experts, and other key

 stakeholders and members of civil society

 were sought. Since the security

 environment is in a constant state of flux,

 this NSS shall undergo a continuous

 process of evolution and shall be

 reviewed, refined and amended as needed.

##### “Traditional and non-traditional security issues test our resolve to promote peace, stability, security and prosperity…

 Geopolitical and strategic developments around the globe also pose a challenge to our shared interests and goals, if not the security of our environment.”

## O confronted by challenges on

###### multiple fronts. Aside from

 decades-old internal armed

 threats, there are emerging risks that pose

 an obstacle to the attainment of national

 unity, peace and stability, economic

 development, and enhanced ties with our

 neighbors and allies. The lack of national

 and sector-specific security strategies to

 address current and emerging concerns

 limits the ability of the Philippine

 government to effectively handle and

 manage these increasingly complex

 challenges.


###### Resolving internal armed conflicts

 remains  our  top  security concern and a

 key cornerstone of our peace and

 development strategy. The government is

 committed to finding a peaceful socio
 political solution to the twin threats posed

 by a lingering communist rebellion and

 Muslim separatist insurgency. However,

 it must also be fully prepared to deal with

 all eventualities, including the possible

 failure of all peaceful initiatives.  Both

 in peace and in war, addressing the root

 causes of conflict and bringing the fruits

 of development closer to conflict-affected

 communities should go hand-in-hand with

 peacekeeping efforts on the ground. 


## O


###### RESOLVING INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICTS REMAINS OUR TOP

 SECURITY CONCERN AND A KEY CORNERSTONE OF OUR PEACE 

 AND DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY.


-----

###### Our external environment likewise

 needs more focused attention. The

 Philippines’ archipelagic attributes and

 geographic location are both a source of

 strength and vulnerability. From most

 indications, the Philippines can indeed

 become a great maritime nation. Among

 archipelagos in the world, the Philippines

 is a unique one for the contiguity with

 which its islands, islets and other marine

 features are clustered together. 

 Apart from its rich natural

 endowments, the Philippines also boasts

 of the highest marine biodiversity in the

 world and the most number of fish species

 and marine mammals. It is home to some

 of the globally-adjudged most beautiful

 beaches in the world – a great push factor

 for the country’s booming tourism

 industry. 

 On the other hand, and as history

 has shown, our strategic geographic

 location and rich natural resources have

 also provided a strong temptation to

 expansionist powers. 


###### The Philippines has not faced any

 direct threat of foreign armed invasion

 since the end of World War II, but there

 are newly evolving regional security

 uncertainties. Strategically straddled

 between the bitterly contested South

 China Sea and the Pacific Ocean, where

 competing interests of superpowers and

 other countries converge, we must be able

 to chart our role in an increasingly multi
 polar global order. 

 Likewise, there are new threats,

 possibly more destructive than invading

 armies. We must be fully equipped not

 only to deter potential aggressors but also

 to protect the archipelago from

 international terrorists, pandemics,

 transnational crimes and natural disasters.

 It is a sad fact that despite the

 lessons of the past our armed forces

 remain one of the weakest in Asia, putting

 in doubt our ability to protect and defend

 our sovereignty and territorial integrity. 

 [9]


-----

###### Developing a credible defense

 capability would be a key priority of this

 administration, while at the same time

 s t r e n g t h e n i n g a n d p u r s u i n g

 comprehensive and strategic alliances or

 cooperation with our friends and partners

 in the international community.

 Fighting criminality and illegal

 drugs is very high on the list of priorities

 of the current administration. The

 country’s drug problem is a particular

 concern as this directly influences

 criminal activity involving drug abuse,

 heinous and violent crime, gang-related

 activities, money laundering, and the

 corruption of the criminal justice system.

 Apart  from destroying society’s moral

 fiber, drug abuse has led to the widespread

 disregard for the rule of law, particularly

 among our youth. 

 Pursuing an inclusive and

 sustainable economic development is the

 main pillar of the administration’s

 economic policy. Despite rapid GDP

 growth in recent years, poverty incidence 


###### in the Philippines – at about 21% -
 remains one of the highest in Asia due to

 unmitigated income gaps and lack of job

 opportunities to sustain a burgeoning

 population of about 104 million. 

 Corollary to this, demographic

 challenges can be either a boon or bane,

 depending on how we would handle it.

 For the ‘boon’ part, call center jobs in the

 cities, strong consumer spending and

 remittances from millions of Filipinos

 who work overseas are fueling the

 Philippine economy. 

 In  2017, the gross domestic

 product (GDP) grew by 6.7 percent. It is

 currently one of the fastest growing

 economies in Asia, after China’s 6.9

 percent and Vietnam’s 6.8 percent. And

 with the implementation of Tax Reform

 Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) law,

 the growth of the Philippine economy is

 expected to further accelerate this year.

###### On the other hand, rapid

 population growth and industrialization

 are putting tremendous pressure on the

 e c o l o g i c a l b a l a n c e, t r i g g e r i n g

 unprecedented disasters brought by a

 deteriorating natural environment. The

 need to prevent man-made disasters,

 soften the impact of natural calamities,

 and save lives is imperative. 

 Many of the possible options and

 solutions to these complex challenges will


###### likely be difficult, even painful, and there

 will always be debates and divisions over

 the proper way to deal with national

 problems. However, over the long haul,

 we must accept that we have only

 ourselves to truly rely on, and that with

 proper planning, preparation and action,

 there is nothing that the Filipinos as a

 nation cannot achieve.

## T


###### he development of a national

 security strategy finds its basis

 in several important tenets of

 nationhood and national


###### identity. A full appreciation of these

 fundamental precepts is crucial in 


###### National Security Defined


###### Globalization and rapid advances

 in modern technology have substantially

 altered the definition of national security,

 from an exclusive or predominant focus

 on armed threats to sovereignty and

 territorial integrity, to clearly non
 traditional threats such as trafficking of

 drugs, cyber security, and extreme

 weather conditions. For many modern

 states, including the Philippines, the new

 outlook encompasses all possible

 challenges to the people’s way of life,

 including threats to public safety,

 governance, economic development,


###### social welfare, and the environment.

 Implicitly, the expanded concept

 highlights not just the threats, but also any

 new opportunities that could enhance

 security or speed up the attainment of

 national goals. 

 Based on the above expanded

 view, the Philippines defines national

 security as “the state or condition

 wherein the nation’s sovereignty and

 territorial integrity, the people’s well
 being, core values, and way of life, and

 the State and its institutions, are

 protected and enhanced.”


-----

###### National Values


###### Our national policies and strategies

 should be a reflection and extension of the

 Filipinos’ core national values. Patriotism

 and love of country, the common good,

 social justice, liberty and democracy are

 some of the fundamental values our

 people explicitly upheld in the

 foundational era of our nationhood, and

 continue to cherish at the present. This is

 evident from the preambles, declaration of

 principles and state policies, and Bill of

 Rights of the 1899, 1935 and 1987

 Constitutions. Today, these values are

 expressed concisely in the spirit of the

 following traits that Philippine popular

 culture attributes to good Filipinos: maka
 Diyos (God-fearing), makatao (humane),

 makabayan (patriotic), and maka
 kalikasan (pro-environment).

 We exalt patriotism as a moral duty

 of every Filipino, who has an obligation to

 pursue the promotion of the material and

 moral welfare of the nation and its people.

 Devotion to the common good is closely


###### related to this principle, with human life

 as its central value. Combined, these twin

 values form the very foundation of our

 national strength and unity, and key to

 the Filipino’s sense  of  oneness amidst

 diversity in religion, language and

 ethnicity. 

 The right to exercise one’s

 religious faith is another fundamental

 building block of our uniqueness as a

 people and as a nation. Regardless of wide

 differences in religious faiths, the belief in

 an all-powerful God has been key to the

 Filipinos’ sense of fortitude and desire to

 lead an upright existence. Faith commonly

 binds the Filipino family together even in

 the face of hardships. The preservation,

 protection and free practice of one’s

 religious faith is therefore an essential part

 of our journey as a nation. 

 The quest for justice has always

 been one of our most fervent national

 aspirations. We are seeking an egalitarian

 system of justice where all citizens


-----

###### receive equal treatment and protection

 before the law. In the same vein, we want

 to give each person and each community a

 just and equal share of the fruits of

 progress while at the same time giving

 preferential attention to the poor and the

 marginalized. 

 Our commitment to freedom and

 democracy is enshrined in our history,

 throughout our long and bitter struggle for

 independence, and presently as a maturing

 Republic. Upholding the rule of law and

 protecting civil liberties and human rights


###### shall remain as essential pillars of our

 democratic society. In our continuing

 quest for the most ideal system of

 government for the Filipino nation, we

 must not be afraid to effect positive

 changes. However, any change should

 continue to harness the most important

 backbones of Philippine democracy

 rooted in the principles of governance by

 deliberation and persuasion, separation of

 powers, system of checks and balances,

 and safeguards against authoritarianism

 and abuse of state power.


###### National Interests


###### The national interest is an intrinsic

 component of the national security

 framework and reflects our national

 values. In the Philippine setting, the

 national interest includes those conditions

 we consider to be desirable or essential to

 the unity, survival and well-being of the

 country and its people. Essentially, it

 embodies our goals and ambitions as a

 nation. Our national strategy depends on


###### what our national interests are and how

 we view these interests in the hierarchy of

 our national priorities. 

 Within this hierarchy of priorities,

 we identified the conditions below as core

 national interests of the Philippines. These

 interests are permanent ones and

 considered as absolutely necessary for the

 very survival of the nation and its people. 


-----

###### • Protection of the freedom, public safety and welfare of the people.

 • Ending all internal armed conflicts, i.e., communist insurgency, violent

 extremism and terrorism.

 • Preservation of the sovereignty and integrity of the national territory.

 • Pursuit of independent foreign policy in the exercise of national

 sovereignty and self-determination.

 • Pursuit and sustainment of inclusive economic growth and development. 

 • Protection of the Filipino public from criminality, illegal drugs,

 pandemics, cyber-attack, and weapons of mass destruction.

 • Freedom from any forms of nuclear weapons within the Philippine

 territory.

 • Protection and preservation of ecological balance.

 • Promotion of social cohesion and national unity.


###### The conditions identified below,

 although not directly threatening the

 survival of the nation, are considered as

 important for the enhancement of national

 security and the well-being of the


###### Filipinos. If unfulfilled, these will result

 in damage that could undermine the

 attainment of our goals, objectives and

 programs.



###### • Development of credible armed forces and pursuit of security sector

 reform.


-----

###### • Improvement of the criminal justice system.

 • Pursuit of inclusive economic growth.

 • Protection and promotion of the welfare of overseas Filipino workers

 (OFWs) and Filipino immigrants.

 • Prevention of other transnational crimes in the country, i.e. trafficking in

 persons, arms smuggling, money laundering, sea piracy, economic and

 environmental crime.

 • Deterrence of illegal migration and intrusion of foreign nationals across

 borders.

 • Promotion of the rights and welfare of farmers especially agrarian

 reform beneficiaries.

 • Promotion of quality education, competitiveness of graduates, and safe

 employment environment.

 Other interests that essentially pertain to our role as a responsible and peaceful

 member of the regional and global community and reflects the kind of nation we want to

 be and how we want to present ourselves to the world are the following:

 • Participation in international efforts to reduce global warming and adapt

 on the impacts of the changing climate.

 • Adherence to international agreements specifically those related to

 counterterrorism, collective security, and non-proliferation of weapons of

 mass destruction.


-----

###### • Participation of the Philippines in the United Nations and other

 international fora and adherence to existing United Nations

 commitments.

 • Promotion of dialogue and negotiation to solve any issues of mutual

 interest.

 National Security Vision 


###### Our national values and national

 interests find their best expression in the

 form of a desired end state and broad

 national vision. Keeping in mind our

 definition of national security, our desired

 end state is a community of peace where

 security as a public good is delivered

 effectively. 

 The national security vision sets

 the country’s desired direction, forms the

 basis  of  all  subsequent policy and

 strategy planning, and seeks to build a

 Filipino nation of empowered citizens,

 living in freedom, dignity, and prosperity

 as one community regardless of social

 status, ethnicity, language, and religion. 


###### In our National Security Policy, the

 Government envisions a Philippines that

 by 2022 shall become “a secure and

 prosperous nation wherein the people’s

 welfare, well-being, way of life and core

 values; government and its institutions;

 territorial integrity and sovereignty are

 protected and enhanced and confident

 of its place in the community of

 nations.” 


-----

###### As such, this National Security

 Strategy envisages a safe and secure

 Philippines, at peace with itself and its

 neighbors, where its citizens are allowed

 to reach their full potential through social


###### cohesion and the promotion of social

 justice and harmony, political stability,

 sound environmental management, and

 economic progress.


###### OUR DESIRED END STATE IS:


###### “A SAFE AND SECURE PHILIPPINES,

 AT PEACE WITH ITSELF AND ITS

 NEIGHBORS, WHERE ITS CITIZENS

 ARE ALLOWED TO REACH THEIR

 FULL POTENTIAL THROUGH SOCIAL

 COHESION AND THE PROMOTION OF

 SOCIAL JUSTICE AND HARMONY,

 POLITICAL STABILITY, SOUND

 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,


###### AND ECONOMIC PROGRESS.”


-----

###### Goals of the National Security Strategy


###### Below is a set of action areas, the

 fulfillment of which will contribute to the

 attainment of the desired national security

 end state.  These action areas are


###### expressed in terms of strategic goals and

 objectives, which in turn form the basis

 for the formulation of agency/institutional

 courses of actions.


###### Guarantee public safety and achieve good governance.

   Mitigate the impact of health related threats.

   Develop a dynamic, inclusive, and sustainable economy.

   Achieve food and water security.

   Safeguard and preserve national sovereignty and territorial integrity.

   Heighten consciousness and pride on Filipino heritage, culture and values.

   Promote human and ecological security.

   Achieve energy security.

   Ensure maritime and airspace security.

   Strengthen international relations.

   Provide strong cyber infrastructure and cyber security.

   Improve vital transportation infrastructure and port security.

-----

###### environment itself is changing, the

 government must regularly evaluate the

 new challenges and threats it is facing. To

 address these threats, the government

 must put together a coherent and effective

 plan of action.

 Second, there is the need to

 provide both political and strategic

 guidance to the implementors of the NSS.

 A country has a national security vision

 and that vision is articulated by the

 political leadership. The leadership

 captures and communicates that vision in

 a strategy so that those who are executing

 the strategy have something clear in front

 of them to follow. It defines the roles of

 institutions and stakeholders in order for

 them to synchronize their policies and

 strategies.  Likewise, private citizens and

 civil society sectors should be encouraged

 to scrutinize it and take the necessary

 steps to contribute to the accomplishment

 of national programs. 


## I


###### n its very essence, the National

 Security Strategy lays down a

 master plan for the attainment of

 the national vision of creating a


###### safer and more prosperous Philippines,

 whereby our national values and way of

 life are protected and enhanced. 

 The NSS integrates the State’s

 major security policies, goals,

 responsibilities and courses of action into

 an overall blueprint for the fulfillment of

 such a vision. It clarifies the institutional

 framework within which the concerned

 government and private institutions will

 coordinate their activities in order to

 create an integrated and cohesive national

 security network.  There are several

 important rationales for the development

 of an NSS.

 First, developing an NSS is

 necessary because security issues

 significantly affect the Philippines’

 chances of attaining all its social and

 economic  goals.  Since  the  security 


-----

###### Third, the NSS helps to generate

 public awareness and create a common

 understanding and ownership of issues

 affecting the country’s security. Through

 t h i s d o c u m e n t t h e g o v e r n m e n t

 communicates the national vision and how

 such a vision is to be achieved.

 Communicating these issues effectively to

 target audiences is crucial for securing the

 kind of consensus, ownership and support

 the government needs to ensure the

 success of the strategy. The government

 needs to communicate the NSS to

 policymakers in order to secure both

 political and resource backing for the

 leadership’s security agenda. Similarly, it

 is important to communicate the NSS to

 the general public in order to win the


###### citizens’ cooperation and participation.

 There is nothing that lures investors more

 than stability, and there is nothing that

 scares them more than instability.

 Fourth, the NSS is about the ends,

 ways and means. The resource aspect is

 always a contentious and yet unavoidable

 issue. One cannot have a strategy without

 touching on the resource aspect because

 the strategy will have to be implemented,

 and if it is going to be implemented, one

 needs to allocate resources and utilize

 these resources in the most cost-effective

 way. Avoiding waste should be a key

 guiding principle. Having a document that

 instructs NSS implementors on how to

 efficiently utilize resources is absolutely

 critical.


###### EFFECTIVE USE OF THE INSTRUMENTS 

 OF NATIONAL POWER


###### The efficacy of our national

 security strategy is dependent on our

 capacity – capability, ability and will - to

 enforce it. The NSS serves as a catalyst to


###### fulfill the national security vision of the

 Philippines through the combined and

 coordinated use of all the resources and

 instruments of national power – political


-----

###### and legal, diplomatic, informational and

 intelligence, economic and technological,

 and military and law enforcement.

 Protecting the national interests and

 enforcing national policies call for good

 governance, a patriotic citizenry united by

 a common purpose, and a credible armed

 forces. The country faces a formidable

 array of internal and external threats to its


###### national interests and well-being that

 require a mix of national instruments

 capable of mitigating the risks, upholding

 national sovereignty, preserving territorial

 integrity, backing foreign policy,

 supporting its development thrusts, and

 protecting public safety and natural

 resources.


###### Political and Legal


###### The political and legal instrument

 shall strengthen policy organization,

 formulation, legislation, implementation,

 and the most critical, generation and

 appropriation of funds. It will address

 several weaknesses pertaining to

 bureaucratic turfing, uneven-playing field,

 p o o r g o v e r n a n c e, u n n e c e s s a r y

 overlapping and multiple inter-agency

 mechanisms. It will promote transparent,

 accountable and participatory governance

 and explore more efficient ways of

 undertaking government tasks by

 developing its e-governance capability. It

 will strengthen the five pillars of the


###### criminal justice system and empower

 citizen’s organizations to actively

 participate in governance, in the

 implementation of public policies, in

 cultivating a culture of peace, and

 mainstreaming conflict sensitive and

 peace promoting approaches in

 safeguarding the safety of the people. It

 will seek to pursue and communicate the

 benefits of a federal-parliamentary form

 of government and identify the need for

 the creation of “rules-based” governance

 in defending our sovereignty and

 territorial integrity and in resolving

 internal conflicts.


-----

###### Diplomatic


###### The diplomatic instrument

 provides the parameters on the outward
 looking position of the Philippines in the

 comity of nations within the bounds of

 international laws, norms and standards.

 It aims to develop good partnerships and


###### improve all forms of foreign relations in

 order to ensure the protection of our

 overseas Filipino workers and advance the

 pursuit of common interests that are

 mutually beneficial to the Philippines and

 other countries.


###### Informational


###### The informational instrument

 aims to promote effective governance,

 through strategic communications, while

 at the same time countering any

 misinformation and deceitful propaganda

 being spread by the enemies of the State.


###### This component also aims to promote

 national consensus, intelligence fusion

 and shared understanding particularly

 with regard to addressing conflicts and its

 root causes.


###### Intelligence


###### Intelligence is foreknowledge and

 therefore should be predictive. It is a vital

 instrument of national power to realize

 national goals and objectives and promote

 the well-being of the nation. Intelligence

 process provides National Intelligence


###### Estimates and other inputs that are

 essential for planning and execution of

 desired political actions and national

 programs. The intelligence instrument

 includes human intelligence, signals

 intelligence, image intelligence, and


-----

###### measurement and signatures intelligence.

 Counterintelligence or the denial of

 undesirable information collection efforts


###### is also included under the intelligence

 instrument.


###### Economic and Technological


###### The economic and technological

 instrument aims to broaden economic

 ventures, foster cooperation in the area of

 innovation and technology development,

 and promote sustainable development. It

 aims to pursue rapid economic growth,

 with particular focus on reducing poverty

 and income gaps through the creation of

 more jobs and the improvement of the


###### education sector. Foreign direct

 investments are a crucial growth engine

 and should therefore continue to be

 encouraged through a peaceful

 environment, increased infrastructure

 spending and a stable fiscal and policy

 milieu. The protection and preservation of

 the ecological environment and natural

 resources will remain a key concern.


###### Military and Law Enforcement


###### The military and law enforcement

 instrument includes the use of well
 equipped, trained, disciplined and

 motivated armed forces to maintain law

 and order at the homefront, and to

 safeguard and defend the country’s

 sovereignty and territorial integrity from


###### any threat of foreign armed aggression. It

 aims to build a credible deterrence

 capability and enhance mutual defense

 arrangements with other nations. 


-----

###### WEALTH CREATION AND RESOURCE GENERATION


###### Over the past three decades at

 least, the defense budget process appears

 to have been afflicted by the paralyzing

 mindset that “we don’t have the money.”

 Despite the continuously intensifying

 internal and external threat environment,

 such negative mindset essentially ignored

 the wisdom of investing in safety and

 strategic security to build a credible

 deterrence to protect and uphold our

 national interests. Consequently, the

 country, by default, has become

 vulnerable to infiltration, sabotage,

 poaching, insurgency, terrorism and

 natural catastrophes. 


###### However, with more wealth being

 created at home in recent years, we now

 have the unique opportunity to reverse

 this fatalistic outlook in government. It is

 time to say, “We have the money and we

 can find more money”; it is high time we

 think of national defense not as a financial

 burden, but as a strategic investment for a

 safer and more secure future. As an

 investment, it has payback in terms of

 enabling and supporting economic growth

 and sustainable development, and

 boosting the national morale.


###### Human Capital Development


###### The Philippines is dealing with a

 massive crop of Filipino men and women

 on the threshold to adulthood who

 potentially form the country’s rich talent

 pool as thinkers, leaders, entrepreneurs,

 employers, creative artists, innovators, job


###### creators, job collaborators, technical

 specialists and experts of all kinds. While

 we continue to deal with the more obvious

 risks related to the country’s population

 boom and the negative effects of a very

 high population density, we shall focus


-----

###### also on the potential opportunities and

 harness their full advantage. The provision

 of quality education complemented by

 sustainable employment or livelihood

 opportunities and a stable security

 environment are integral in solving the

 country’s multifarious national problems. 

 We have a considerable percentage

 of English-speaking people and deploy

 about 8 to 10 million overseas workers

 spread across continents and working in

 various levels of expertise. Our overseas

 workers are exposed to foreign cultures

 and are knowledgeable in management

 and in communication and technology

 applications, making them competitive

 candidates for future employment both

 here and abroad. 

 Presently, the Philippines is also

 the world’s business process outsourcing

 (BPO) leader. Certainly, our talented and

 industrious work force represents one of

 our greatest competitive strengths. To

 sustain these potentials, the Government

 shall continue to provide global-standard

 education for its citizens. 


###### However, beyond having the “right

 stuff,” our human resource also needs to

 develop the kind of mindframe that

 compels them to look beyond their own

 personal interests, needs, or circumstances

 and attune this with the interests and

 needs of Philippine society as a whole. 

 This kind of patriotic mindset

 should be nurtured in every institution of

 learning, where the students can develop

 an appreciation and understanding of

 society, governance, multi-dimensional

 national security, and sustainable

 development.   

 The National Defense College of

 the Philippines (NDCP), the Philippine

 Public Safety College (PPSC), the Foreign

 Service Institute (FSI), and other military

 and police training institutions shall be the

 primary institutions of learning for

 building up and expanding the pool of

 national security leaders and practitioners

 in the country.


-----

###### National Security Legislation


###### The Government must work

 towards the enactment of appropriate

 legislations to address the country’s

 complex national security challenges, and

 protect and promote the nation’s interests.

 One such legislation is the expanded

 National Security Code in order to meet

 the continuing threats of terrorism,

 insurgencies, criminalities and

 transnational crimes. It will also

 strengthen the Organization for National

 Security, revitalize the system for unified

 coordination among the members of the

 security community, and provide the legal

 basis for the formulation, integration, and

 implementation of the NSP and NSS. The

 Government will work with Congress to

 attain the passage of this proposed law. 

 The Government shall also work

 for the passage of pending bills in

 Congress pertaining to national security

 concerns. Among these are the proposed

 bills on Witness Protection and

 Whistleblowers Act, Uniformed Personnel


###### Pension Reform, National Defense Act,

 Chemical Weapons Convention Act,

 Amendments to the Immigration Act, PNP

 Modernization and Reorganization,

 Mandatory ROTC, Amendments to the

 Dangerous Drugs Act, Creation of the

 Department of Disaster Resilience,

 Protection  of Children in Situation of

 Armed Conflict, Defense Acquisition,

 Archipelagic Sea Lanes, Maritime Zones,

 and the draft Bangsamoro Basic Law

 (BBL). The BBL is seen as the political

 solution to the age old conflict and

 marginalization in the Bangsamoro

 region. The Government will vigorously

 pursue amendments to the Philippine

 Constitution aimed at facilitating the shift

 to a new form of government and refining

 key economic provisions.  Executive

 Orders, Memoranda, Directives, Letter of

 Instruction, etc. will also be issued from

 time to time to strengthen security

 legislation.


-----

###### OTHER LEGISLATIONS AIMED AT ADDRESSING  TERRORISM AND ILLEGAL DRUGS

 1. Amendments to the Human Security Act (HSA) - to strengthen the coordination and authority of the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency (NICA) and the Anti-Terrorism Council (ATC) in suppressing terrorism. In amending the HSA, the NICA, or its successor organization, shall continue to perform its duty as Secretariat of the ATC. On the other hand, the ATC-Program Management Center, in addition to its other tasks, shall continue to serve as the coordinator of the Council in the performance of the Council’s functions. The institutionalization of this set up will be done by the inclusion of the ATC-PMC in the HSA amendment. Moreover, the objective of the amendatory bill is generally to make the law consistent with the UN Conventions on Anti- Terrorism and the adoption of international best practices, considering that since the enactment of the HSA, no case has prospered in the country. 2. Amendments to the Anti-Wiretapping Law - to judicially authorize the real-time/live monitoring of telecommunications in cases involving pre-identified and confirmed persons or entities linked to terrorism and other grave criminal activities. 3. Enactment of a SIM Card Registration Law - to pre-identify users of SIM cards and facilitate their identification, as well as deter those who plan to use the same for terrorist or other criminal activities. 4. Amendments to the Anti-Terrorism Financing Law - to freeze any account of pre-identified or confirmed terrorist personalities, organizations or other entities engaged in terrorist financing or trafficking in strategic goods (i.e. weapons of mass destruction and items of dual/alternative use that can be applied in, converted to, or otherwise made a part of weapons of mass destruction, pursuant to our obligation under UNSCR 2178) in coordination with the work of AMLC.  5. Enactment of an Official Secrets Act – to: (1) absorb best practices/provisions from laws of various countries that already have such legislation; (2) provide classification and parameters for classifying government secrets, authority for classifying and declassifying; (3) provide funds for required hardware and software for databases, protocol for storage, retrieval, access to, declassification and release to the public, period for storage, and protocol for destruction; (4) proscribe solicitation by foreign user/s; and (5) legislate severe criminal liability for violations. 6. Amendments to the Cybercrime Law – to authorize, without prior judicial intervention/court order, the blocking of any Internet site or source of pre-identified/confirmed terrorists, terrorist organizations, or others propagandizing, inviting, inducing, recruiting for terrorism, including terrorist financing for timely immediate action. In amending the Cybercrime law, include provision of guidelines and detailed description of the crimes. 7. Amendments to the Passport Law – to authorize the Department of Justice (DOJ), without prior judicial intervention/court order, to withhold, suspend, cancel/revoke passports or other travel documents of Filipino extremists who have undergone trainings or have fought with/joined UN proscribed terrorist organizations. The DOJ confirmation of the legal basis for these actions will be for the immediate implementation of the Department of Foreign Affairs. Also, this requires synchronization and amendment of the Immigration Law.

###### Funding National Security


###### Central to the shift in government

 outlook prescribed above is the need to

 start exploring the possibility that there

 are potentially other sources and means to

 generate funds for the tremendous

 demands of national security. Funding our

 credible deterrence capability will end the

 era of strategic drift that failed to

 effectively manage safety and security

 risks. Decades of inaction have led to

 devastating consequences to internal

 security and have undermined our ability

 to adequately prepare for external defense

 in the future. Keeping defense spending

 low to save money is a spurious

 conjecture; it simply pushes expenses for

 maintenance, training, and capital stock

 into the future, and at the expense of the

 country’s security and well-being.

 There is a need to increase the size

 and deterrent capability of the Navy and

 the Air Force as quickly as possible to

 serve as our external defense, protect our

 national territory and Exclusive Economic

 Zone (EEZ), and modernize all branches


###### of the armed forces. In addition, necessary

 procedures should be taken as outlined

 above to fix the acquisition system,

 rebalance compensation for service

 members, and pass legislations that aim to

 create new wealth and strengthen human

 and materiel resources. 

 The above requires a dynamic and

 collaborative mix of executive and

 legislative actions, with support from our

 policymakers and economic managers. In

 support of our defense modernization, the

 government has to allocate at least 2

 percent of the GDP as the minimum

 annual budget for the defense sector in

 order to elevate ourselves from the (near)

 bottom position and quickly catch up with

 our ASEAN neighbors, and fully exercise

 our sovereignty. Myanmar, whose GDP

 per capita is smaller than the Philippines,

 allocated 4.8% of GDP (2016) for military

 expenditure (SIPRI). 


-----

###### Apart from the budget provided by

 the General Appropriations Act (GAA),

 the Executive and Legislative branches

 can also work together to identify and

 develop other potential funding sources.

 The funds generated from such sources

 will be lodged in an exclusive national

 account under the Office of the President


###### with congressional oversight. This is to

 ensure that the GAA for public

 administration and the delivery of basic

 services will not be impacted by the

 requirements for credible deterrence.

 There are important caveats to ensure

 smooth program execution to prevent

 costly delays. The Procurement Law


###### OTHER POTENTIAL FUNDING SOURCES FOR NATIONAL SECURITY

 • Convert portions of selected idle military lands in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao into defense industrial parks

and mixed-use residential-commercial zones, especially those bordering on highly developed regions.

Conversion of lands will be coordinated with the concerned departments concerning rules and regulations on

land use conversion.

###### • Float long-term bonds or Treasury bills for sale to the corporate and sovereign markets here and abroad.

Additionally, create affordable, low-denominated bonds for sale to patriotic individual citizens, to include our

OFWs abroad.

###### • Legislate a special national security tax applicable to mass air-sea-land transports and passengers; and to

telecommunication companies and end-users.

###### • Legislate a revision of the Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations (GOCC) charters to set aside at

least 3 percent of annual net income for credible deterrence.

###### • Legislate adjustments in the formula providing for the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) of local government

units (LGUs) that carves out a significant amount of the annual IRA for credible deterrence. LGUs must be

harnessed to help fund the effort which will be used to protect their own territories.

###### • Free up cash generated annually from anti-corruption and efficiency improvement measures targeting at least

10 percent of the GAA in ascending rates over time.

 Commission on Audit (COA) rules and

 regulations, as well as bidding procedures

 and the rules of engagement among

 dispensed with, to prevent unwarranted

 legal obstructionism.


###### Development of Strategic Industries


###### Developing the strategic industries

 can make this sector a potential element of

 national power. With its ample natural

 resources and huge skilled workforce, the

 Philippines could become another success

 story in the field of strategic industries,

 something long overdue. 

 The long-term objectives are: (1)

 generate resources and wealth for the

 Filipino people; (2) expand, diversify and

 transform the economy of the country -
 from an agricultural to an industrial/

 manufacturing economy; (3) provide

 sufficient jobs to sustain the Philippines’

 growing population; and (4) accelerate

 nation-building, economic development,

 and stability of the country.


###### Of critical importance is the nature

 of technology to be utilized and the types

 of industry that can support rapid and

 sustainable economic development.

 Among the industries we need to develop

 further are agriculture and aquaculture,

 aircraft, investment and banking,

 biotechnology, construction, disaster

 prevention, electronics, environment,

 information and communications

 technology, land combat, manufacturing,

 robotics, satellite systems and space,

 shipbuilding, strategic materials and

 minerals, transportation, weapons, and

 tourism.

 Criminalities, Public Safety, Rule of Law and Human Rights


###### Public safety is defined as the

 overall welfare and protection of the

 general public. Prevailing public safety

 concerns are criminality, illegal drugs,

 and natural and human-induced disasters.

 The strategic objective is to mainstream

 the concept of public safety in the

 national security agenda to build peaceful,

 safe and resilient communities. 


###### This entails the integration of law

 enforcement, community policing,

 disaster management and resilience, and

 local governance in the security sector

 framework. 

 In times of calamities or terror

 attacks, there is a need to prioritize

 securing access to the affected areas. 


-----

###### Public safety can be

 better established if the

 roads and bridges leading

 to the distressed areas are

 secure and passable.

 Corollary to this is

 the promotion of the rule

 values which enables the

 attainment of public

 safety and national

 observance of the rule of

 law, value the dignity of

 every human being and

 guarantee full respect for

 human rights. 


###### KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS

 • Institutionalize reforms within the PNP that will command community and citizen

 respect, trust, and confidence.

 • Build resilient communities that are able to deal with and recover from every

 crisis.

 • Guarantee the mobility and secure access of aid workers and peace-keeping

 officers to affected areas in times of calamities or terror attacks.

 with food crops such as rice and corn. 


-----

###### However, despite the abundance of

 water in the country, there has still been a

###### HEIGHTEN CONSCIOUSNESS AND PRIDE ON FILIPINO HERITAGE, CULTURE AND VALUES


###### The Philippines is a nation of

 diverse cultures that were rooted from the

 East and the West. But even prior to

 colonization, our indigenous peoples

 already had their distinct justice and

 governance systems, customs and

 traditions, arts, literature, music, dance,

 and values. This was later influenced by

 the introduction of Islam, the coming of

 the Chinese, the Spaniards, the

 Americans, and the Japanese. 

 These various cultural influences

 have led us to become a country with

 120-170 languages and dialects, spoken

 by 110 ethno-linguistic groups, and

 having distinct values of friendliness,

 hospitality, spirituality, and gratitude.

 Culture is also varied according to age

 group, gender, spirituality, and socio
 economic class. 


###### Just like the archipelagic nature of

 our country, we take pride in our heritage

 of looking at our narratives – from Luzon,

 Visayas, and Mindanao – as being one

 history of the Filipino people.

 information/intelligence gathering;

 conducting policy research and analysis; 


###### THE ORGANIZATION FOR NATIONAL SECURITY


###### As Head of State and Government,

 the President of the Republic of the

 Philippines plays a central role in national

 security management and decision
 making primarily in terms of giving broad

 guidance and impetus to the formulation

 and implementation of national security

 policies and strategies. In performing such


###### a role, he is aided by two multi-agency

 bodies: the National Security Council

 (NSC) and the National Economic and

 Development Authority (NEDA) Board.

 The President has also the authority to

 seek advice from other members of the

 Filipino national community. 


-----

-----

###### A. National Security Council (NSC)


###### The National Security Council is

 the principal advisory body on the proper

 coordination and integration of policies

 and plans affecting national security. The

 NSC consists of two distinct bodies – the

 Council Proper and the Office of the

 National Security Adviser and Director

 General of the NSC Secretariat. 

 The National Security Council

 Proper is a collegial body chaired by the

 President. It is composed of the Vice

 President, the Senate President, the

 Speaker of the House of Representatives,

 selected Cabinet members, former

 presidents, and other government officials

 and private citizens or organizations who

 may be invited by the President.

 Theoretically, the Council Proper is where

 crucial policy decisions are arrived at.

 However, being collegial in nature, the

 Council Proper  is  convened only

 periodically, as may be called by the

 President.  The NSC Secretariat, on the

 other hand, is a permanent body that


###### provides technical support to the Council

 Proper. It is headed by the Director

 General, who is at the same time the

 National Security Adviser (NSA). Under

 the direction of the President, the National

 Security Council’s main functions are: 

 • Assist the President in directing the

 National Security Policy and in giving

 direction to the execution of the

 National Security Strategy; 

 • Guide in the drafting of any second
 level Strategies that are deemed

 necessary and, if appropriate, proceed

 to their approval; 

 • M o n i t o r c o m p l i a n c e i n t h e

###### • Perform other tasks attributed to it by

 law or as directed by the President. 


###### B. Cabinet Cluster on Security, Justice and Peace


###### Over the past decades, successive

 administrations have organized and

 reorganized a Cabinet Cluster on national

 security matters. At present, the Cluster on

 Security, Justice and Peace (EO No. 24,

 series of 2017) has been tasked to ensure

 the preservation of national sovereignty

 and the rule of law; as well as focus on the

 protection and promotion of human rights

 and the pursuit of a just, comprehensive,

 and lasting peace. The cluster is also the

 principal government body that supervises

 the government’s responses during

 emergencies related to national security. 

 The Cluster on Security, Justice

 and Peace is responsible for coordinating

 and harmonizing efforts to formulate the

 country’s national security policies and


###### strategies. Once adopted, it is the

 responsibility of the cluster to monitor the

 status of implementation and assess the

 impact of these policies and strategies. 

 The Cluster on Security, Justice

 and Peace is chaired by the Secretary of

 the Department of National Defense

 (DND), and has as its members the

 following: Executive Secretary; Cabinet

 Secretary; Secretaries of the Department

 of Interior and Local Government

 (DILG), Department of Foreign Affairs

 (DFA) and Department of Justice (DOJ);

 the National Security Adviser; and the

 Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process.

 The NSC Secretariat acts as the Cluster

 Secretariat.

###### C. National Intelligence Board


###### It is in the national interest to

 widen and diversify the sources of

 intelligence information from the civilian

 coordination and integration of

 intelligence activities.  Pursuant to

 Executive Order No. 246, series of 1987,

 the National Intelligence Board (NIB) is

 mandated to coordinate and integrate all

 intelligence activities in the Government.

 It is therefore the responsibility of the NIB

 to monitor and verify compliance of the

 Intelligence Community’s activities with

 the National Security Strategy.  The

 National Security Strategy will be revised

 periodically based on the Board’s advice

 and recommendation.

 The NIB submits an Annual Report

 to the Office of the National Security

 Adviser (ONSA) and debates on the

 guidelines of the policies and strategic

 lines of actions of the NSS. The National

 Security Adviser / Director General of the

 National Security Council Secretariat


###### (NSA/DG-NSCS), as Chair of the NIB

 (A.O. No. 124, series of 2005) transmits

 the said Report to the President, the

 Council Proper, and the Cabinet Cluster

 on Security, Justice and Peace. In his

 capacity as Chair of the NIB, the NSA/

 DG-NSCS shall conduct periodically an

 audit of the overall performance of the

 Intelligence Community in order to ensure

 that the programs undertaken achieve the

 identified goals. AO 124 likewise directs

 the NSA / DG-NSCS to revitalize the

 Intelligence Community to render it more

 responsive for the demands of the new

###### REINVIGORATING THE NATIONAL SECURITY SECTOR


###### The effectiveness of the national

 security sector depends on its ability to

 remain pro-active and dynamic in the face

 of rapidly and ever-changing national

 security environment. To do so, it must

 constantly conduct a self-evaluation and

 seek self-perfection.  Revitalizing the

 sector may necessitate updated education

 and training, structural realignments and

 streamlining to ensure a more efficient

 command and control and a more cost
 effective utilization of government

 resources and manpower. 

 Given the complex gamut of

 security-related disasters and emergencies

 that may arise, the country’s crisis

 management capability should be one of

 the top priorities in any serious effort to

 revitalize the national security sector. In

 particular, the crisis-management sector

 should evolve into a highly equipped,

 trained, motivated, systematic, organized

 and reliable system that can readily and

 speedily respond to crisis situations as


###### they arise, or anticipate crisis situations

 and prevent them even before they arise.

 The system should be able to readily issue

 and coordinate clear guidelines for action

 while following standardized and inter
 operable instruments within the purview

 of the national security structure. It shall

 provide close supervision over the

 operations of designated units on the

 ground as well as provide a system of

 monitoring and providing feedback and

 situation updates in as real time as

 possible. 

 Meanwhile, the role of the NSC

 Proper and Secretariat should be further

 honed and tapped. Ideally, the NSC is the

 lead instrumentality of the national

 government mandated to address the

 multi-faceted national security concerns

 of the Philippines. So far, however, its

 activities have been largely limited to

 making decisions on high-impact external

 and internal security issues confronting

 the country. Executive Order No. 115


-----

###### (series of 1986) states that the function of

 the NSC is “to advise the President with

 respect to the integration of domestic,

 foreign, military, political, economic,

 social, and educational policies relating to

 the national security so as to enable all

 concerned ministries, departments, and

 agencies of the government to meet more

 effectively, problems and matters

 involving the national security.” 

 Relatedly, the NSC Secretariat’s

 role of providing technical assistance to

 the Council Proper should be further

 optimized by developing its potential for

 research and national security policies and

 strategies formulation, management and

 communication tasks. Additional staffing

 should be provided and adequate training

 programs initiated in order to develop a

 highly competent pool of policy research

 and intelligence analysts and national

 security managers and communicators. 

 Reforming the national security

 sector and perfecting the crisis
 management system would necessitate

 efforts to institutionalize the changes.


###### This may be done through legislation or

 executive orders. The NSC Secretariat is

 currently in the process of preparing a

 draft bill for National Security which will

 be submitted to Congress for approval. In

 t h e m o r e i m m e d i a t e t e r m,

 institutionalizing and managing the

 National Security Strategy process must

 be put into place.

 Message During the 120[th] Anniversary Celebration of the Philippine Independence Day / June 2018

###### challenges it faces today. Through a

 careful identification of the national

 interests and what currently threaten such

 interests, 12 major national security goals

 have been outlined in this NSS. Every

 goal reached should bring the nation a

 step closer to its vision of a more

 peaceful, more prosperous and better

 future for the Filipino people. 

 To achieve the national vision, the

 State must harness all the assets and

 resources at its disposal. This requires the

 entire government and other sectors of

 society to work together, shoulder-to
 shoulder, in a more well-planned,

 organized and synchronized manner

 toward the fulfillment of the 12-point

 national security agenda. All government

 departments and agencies should critically

 examine their policies and conduct their

 own internal assessment of their roles in

 realizing these national goals. 


## T

 unique set of historical and

 geopolitical circumstances that

 have combined to create a

 continues to be slowed down from within

 by long-standing political-security

 problems that have impeded the country’s

 ability to realize its full developmental

 potential. Resolving the country’s

 domestic troubles has gained more

 significance as the nation endeavors to

 better define its role in relation to the

 outside world, which is currently in a

 rapid state of flux. If unprepared, the

 Philippines will find it quite difficult to

 face its external challenges and to fully

 take advantage of new and exciting

 possibilities in the emerging global

 economic order. 

 Only by ending all internal

 conflicts, creating a safer society, and

 making the fruits of development more

 evenly distributed among its people can

 this nation hope to live up to the 


-----

###### Further reforms are needed in the

 national security sector to make it more

 efficient and proactive, able to respond

 quickly and effectively to national

 emergencies as they arise, and to predict

 and preempt crisis situations even before

 they arise. The national security

 community must make an effort to

 constantly seek self-perfection, hone and

 learn new skills, and overcome some of its

 most serious internal weaknesses related

 to turf issues and negative mindsets. 

 Finally, this NSS requires no less

 than a whole-of-nation campaign. In our

 quest for meaningful change and a better

 future, every individual citizen, every

 sector of civil society, is enjoined to work

 hand-in-hand with the Government in the


###### highest spirit of the Filipino people’s

 culture of “bayanihan.” 

 As earlier pointed out, the NSS

 initiative is a relatively nascent process in

 the Philippines and will therefore be

 updated as needed. It will be difficult to

 always agree among ourselves on issues

 related to national development and

 national security, but this in itself should

 be viewed as a necessary precondition for

 n a t i o n a l r e n e w a l a n d s o c i e t a l

 transformation.

###### ANNEX A – THREATS AND CHALLENGES IN THE INTERNAL AND      

 EXTERNAL SECURITY ENVIRONMENT

 (NSP 2017-2022)


###### The national security sector needs to give focused attention to several major internal and external issues and challenges confronting the Philippine society. 

 INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT


###### Law and Order and Administration of Justice The Philippines has grappled for years with a serious peace and order problem.  The national crime rate, considered as one of the highest in Southeast and East Asia, has posed a significant deterrent to investments as well as constrained the country’s overall development potential. While the number of reported crimes has been rising, the ability of the police to solve crime has decreased. The twin scourge of corruption and patronage politics plaguing law enforcement institutions and government sector as a whole has made it extremely hard, if not impossible, to bring the crime rate down.  Clearly, ensuring public security and enforcing the rule of law is one of the key governance challenges confronting the Philippine Government.  This has amplified the need to undertake crucial r e f o r m s a i m e d a t c l e a n s i n g a n d strengthening the five pillars of the criminal justice system, namely: law enforcement, the courts, prosecution,


###### correctional institutions, and the community. The Philippines’ growing illegal drugs problem in particular needs a determined and proactive solution. Successive researches and pertinent crime statistics in the Philippines show a strong and direct correlation between crimes, especially serious or violent ones, and drug abuse. Any serious campaign to fight crime should therefore also involve a resolute crusade to stamp out drug abuse. This is a tough challenge. In 2015, the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) reported that a fifth—or 8,629 out of the country’s 42,065 barangays—were “drug affected,” determined by the presence of at least one user, pusher, manufacturer, or other drug personality in the area. Based on PDEA’s 2014 arrest data, methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu tops the list of most abused illegal drugs, followed by marijuana and expensive party drugs like cocaine and ecstasy. The proliferation of illegal drugs and the extent of drug trade in the Philippines are also reflected in the rising


-----

###### volume of seizures of illegal drugs over the past few years amounting to:  Php. 5.44 billion (2013), Php. 6.18 billion (2014), Php. 5.42 billion (2015), and Php. 12.4 billion (2016).
 Internal Armed Conflicts The communist rebellion being waged by the Communist Party of the Philippines, together with its armed wing, the New People's Army (NPA), and its political wing, the National Democratic Front (NDF/P); continues to pose serious peace and order problems in the country. The CPP-NPA-NDF rebellion is one of the world’s longest running communist insurgencies and has claimed an estimated 30,000 lives since the 1960s. While the NPA is believed to have fewer than 4,000 guerrillas now, down from a peak of 26,000 in the 1980s, it retains support among the extremely poor in the rural Philippines. There are persistent challenges to the three-decade-old peace negotiations with the communists, but the Government will keep forging on until both parties agree to end the fighting.  The Mindanao conflict being waged by non-state armed groups and extremist movements remains a major source of instability in resource-rich but impoverished parts of southern Philippines (or Mindanao). The on-and-off peace process with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) – the largest and most organized of the myriad radical groups operating in Mindanao – made a promising breakthrough when finally, a peace deal was signed in March 2014.  A draft Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL), which


###### forms the backbone of the 2014 peace accord, is pending approval in the Philippine Congress.  In line with the above, the Government, since the 1990s, has taken steps to decentralize power aimed at addressing the root causes of internal conflicts, namely: poverty and social injustice, widespread economic inequity, poor governance, abuse and control of political power, and marginalization of cultural communities which includes land security, natural resources, identity and human rights. The Local Government Code of 1991 sought to empower regions and local government units in a bid to distribute wealth more evenly and to extend the reach of essential government services to the broadest segments of the population. It is time to take these initial gains to the next higher level by exploring the full benefits of political devolution through a new form of government. The proposal could spur long and vigorous discussions among Filipinos, who have never known any other government than the present unitary one -- but let the public debates start now.
 Terrorism and Transnational Crimes  I n t e r n a t i o n a l t e r r o r i s m a n d transnational crimes pose a direct threat to the security of individual countries and to international peace and prosperity. These twin problems are a persistent global threat that know no borders, nationality or religion, and operate outside the rule of law. Transnational terrorists and crime syndicates are usually well-organized internationally and domestically. They are


-----

###### well-resourced, have access to the latest technologies and skills, and will use unlimited or any form of violence to achieve their goals and objectives.
 The Philippines faces continuing threats from terrorism, both of foreign and domestic origin. The Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) remains as the foremost terrorist group actively inflicting severe socio- political and economic disruptions. The ASG is an Islamist extremist organization known for its bandit-like tactics and notorious for beheadings and kidnap-for- ransom activities in Mindanao.  Radically inspired by the Al Qaeda (Osama bin Laden) in its formative years, the ASG along with its affiliates, such as the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) and Rajah Solaiman Movement (RSM), has a long-term intention of waging jihadist war against non-Muslims.  Its members are known to have linkages with members of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF). The ASG has recently pledged its allegiance (bay’ah) to the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL/IS) but has faced stiff resistance due to continuing police and military operations. In addition to the ASG, other local terrorist groups such as the Ansar al-Khilafah Philippines (AKP), Maute Group, and Daesh-inspired entities have the potential to inflict various forms of violent attacks not only in Mindanao but also in any part of the Philippines.  Meanwhile, the problem of transnational crimes has become more pressing. Given its archipelagic attributes,


###### the Philippines’ borders are porous and vulnerable to the activities of international crime syndicates. These illegal trans- border activities include: drug trafficking; human trafficking of children, women, illegal migrants and labor; illegal fishing/ poaching; arms smuggling; money laundering; and wildlife trafficking. The Philippines’ southern maritime borders which are shared with its ASEAN neighbors are also areas of concern due to the prevalence of high sea piracy and other related criminal activities. The asymmetric nature of terrorism and transnational crime requires the national government to continuously review and update current strategies, and to develop an integrated approach involving concerned law enforcement agencies of the Government.  The Philippines must strengthen and enhance already existing cooperation with international partners while seeking to develop new ones in this regard.
 Economic and Social Threats  Poverty remains pervasive and is not expected to change significantly in the near future. As the population continues to grow, more Filipinos are expected to join the ranks of the poor so long as the poverty rate remains largely unaddressed. Data from the Philippine Statistics Authority showed that poverty incidence among Filipinos in 2015 remains unacceptably high at 21.6%. On the other hand, subsistence incidence among Filipinos, or the proportion of Filipinos whose incomes fall below the food threshold, was estimated at 8.1% during the same period. 


-----

###### Income inequality between the rich and the poor and between urban and rural areas has remained high and will likely persist into the future. The poorest 20% of Filipinos own less than 5% of the country’s total income and the richest 10% of the population accumulate income 2.7 times more than that of the poorest 40%.  Moreover, average yearly unemployment and underemployment rates for the past five years remained steady at around 6% and 18%, respectively. In absolute terms, about 2.8 million Filipinos were unemployed. While unemployment rate increased recently, the underemployment rate dropped to 16.3% in January 2017 from 19.6% recorded in the same year ago. In absolute terms, about 6.4 million Filipinos were underemployed, according


###### to the Labor Force Survey released by Philippine Statistics Authority in January 2017.  Different levels of economic and s o c i a l d e v e l o p m e n t, a l o n g w i t h demographic pressures, cause hunger and malnutrition, homelessness, and larger migrations of people from rural to urban areas.  Demographic migrations, in addition to social problems and the growth of crime, can lead to increased instability and insecurity. Infectious diseases are also o n t h e r i s e p a r t i c u l a r l y h u m a n immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Many of the HIV/AIDS cases were reported among overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) and among workers engaged in business process outsourcing. 


###### EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT


###### Overlapping Territorial Claims and    Maritime Domain Issues  The country needs to address the disputes concerning maritime boundaries as they affect a complex range of national security concerns as well as threaten regional peace and stability.  The Philippines must ensure good order within its sea boundaries and develop appropriate maritime domain awareness and response force capability to address the presence of hostile forces at sea, pirates, terrorists, traffickers, illegal fishers, and other environmental transgressors.  The Philippines must also protect the nation’s maritime interests in the Philippine Rise and Batanes islands in the North, and the


###### ZamBaSulTa and Bongao islands in the Southern Philippines.  T h e d i s p u t e o v e r t h e We s t Philippine Sea (WPS) remains to be the foremost security challenge to the Philippines’ sovereignty and territorial integrity. In July 2016, the Philippines won a key victory when the United Nations Arbitral Tribunal ruled that the Philippines has exclusive sovereign rights over the WPS (in the South China Sea) and that China’s “nine-dash- line” claim is invalid.  Cognizant of the need to protect the nation’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, the Philippines will tread with prudence on this complex and delicate issue and will carefully calibrate its


-----

###### diplomatic moves to avert the costly consequences of any potential outbreak of armed confrontations in the disputed sea region. 
 The Government is looking to begin the process of diplomatic negotiations with neighboring countries to delimit and define maritime borders and jurisdictions. In this connection, the enactment of laws pertaining to national defense, maritime zones, archipelagic sea lanes air defense identification zone, and all other matters necessary for compliance with the country’s commitments and obligations under international law is urgent and imperative.

 Global and Regional Geopolitical Issues 
 In addition to the WPS issue, there are other inter- and intra-state flashpoints of immediate concern to the Philippines.  These include the intensifying conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, persisting tension in the Korean Peninsula, unresolved territorial disputes in Northeast and Southeast-Asia, unsettled Sabah issue, China-Taiwan/ China-Japan/ Japan-South Korea conflicts, and other power rivalries where the hegemony of the United States is contested and threatened. 
 United States The United States remains as the only superpower in the world today and maintains its strategic presence around the globe. In the Asia Pacific region, the US, during the Barack Obama administration, sought to improve its military standing through the introduction of more sophisticated weapons systems, in the improvement of basing facilities and in the


###### alliance and multilateral network it has set up among its regional partners. A continuing US security presence in the Asia Pacific is a stabilizing force, particularly with the growing complexity of security challenges that confront the region. The US remains as the sole defense treaty ally of the Philippines. The Mutual Defense Treaty of 1951 between the Philippines and the United States has been strengthened under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) of 2015 granting the U.S. increased military presence in the country for humanitarian and maritime security operations. Under the Donald Trump presidency, Washington has articulated its vision for a “free and open Indo-Pacific region. Hence, it is expected that the new US administration will remain closely engaged with regional affairs. The Philippines will work closely with the US on a whole range of issues, including shared security and economic concerns. 
 China With China’s rise as the world’s second largest economy, surpassing Japan, attention has focused towards its direction due to its huge population, large territory and vast natural r e s o u r c e s, r a p i d i n d u s t r i a l a n d technological breakthroughs, unparalleled economic growth, and resultant military aggressiveness in Asia. The rivalry of major powers, spawned largely by the rise of China, is the most important long-term strategic concern of the Asia-Pacific region. Indeed, Beijing’s rise generated policy concerns not only among developed


-----

###### countries such as the US, Japan and Korea, but also among the ASEAN due to significant trade and investments, as well as territorial claims in the WPS and the SCS. China’s more active and aggressive presence in the WPS is motivated by growing need for food sources, increasing demand for energy resources, and renewed stirrings of nationalism. 
 ASEAN While its member-states are not without disagreements, ASEAN has nonetheless consistently upheld the principles of consultation and consensus as its norm in resolving inter-state misunderstanding and conflicts. ASEAN is building a Political-Security Community, an Economic Community and a Socio- Cultural Community to promote greater regional integration and to strengthen ASEAN centrality in the context of the wider Asia-Pacific region. The ASEAN as a regional bloc had pursued greater regional cooperation on common problems such as combating piracy, smuggling, human trafficking, terrorism and other transnational crimes. ASEAN centrality is important as it complements other efforts in managing the impact of the geopolitical rivalry among the great powers. 
 Japan Japan remains as an economic power house in Asia and the new security challenges confronting it will induce Tokyo to seek closer security relations with other regional states. Their pacifist constitution is a product of its experience in World War II as well as the continuing security umbrella the US has been providing it. 


###### However, because of various security challenges in the region including territorial disputes in the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands, Japan sought to reorient its security posture under its policy of a “proactive contribution to peace,” which calls for enhanced defensive capabilities as well as strengthens security relations with other states. Japan has entered into a strengthened strategic partnership with the Philippines aimed at boosting political, security and defense ties and cooperation between the two countries.
 Other Regional Players Other regional powers such as Australia, India, Republic of Korea, and Russia are crucial in the peace, stability, and prosperity of the broader Indo-Asia- Pacific region. Engagement with these powers through various platforms, p a r t i c u l a r l y t h r o u g h A S E A N - l e d mechanisms such as the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and East Asia Summit (EAS), among others, will further enhance understanding and build confidence against the backdrop of an evolving regional security environment. Such multilateral initiatives will complement efforts to enhance ASEAN centrality.  The Philippines will work closely with these powers based on mutual respect and shared interests through bilateral and multilateral platforms.

###### OTHER STRATEGIC ISSUES AND CHALLENGES


###### Rising Threat of Cybercrime  T h e l a t e s t r e p o r t b y P r i c e Waterhouse Coopers’ (PWC) Global Economic Crime Survey revealed that cybercrime is today’s fastest rising economic crime.  Expounding on the nature of cybercrime, Interpol said that more and more criminals are exploiting the speed, convenience and anonymity of the Internet to commit a wide range of criminal activities that know no borders, either physical or virtual, cause serious harm and pose very real threats to victims worldwide. Credit card fraud, ATM theft, call center scams, and other computer or web-based forms of deception schemes a n d i d e n t i t y t h e f t h a v e b e c o m e increasingly rampant especially in Asia.  New and increasingly creative trends in cybercrime are emerging all the time, with estimated costs to the global economy running to billions of dollars. Interpol added that in the past, cybercrime was committed mainly by individuals or small groups, but today we are seeing highly complex cybercriminal networks bring together individuals from across the globe


###### in real time to commit crimes on an unprecedented scale. To meet these rapidly evolving security challenges in cyberspace, the Philippines must first and foremost develop the nation’s cyber infrastructure and cyber security. Experts noted that one of the most serious weaknesses of the Philippines is the low number of practicing cybersecurity professionals. The State must enhance and expand its pool of i n f o r m a t i o n a n d c o m m u n i c a t i o n technology (ICT) experts, especially in the law enforcement and security sectors, in order to equip the government with the necessary skills/knowhow to detect, preempt and combat cyber-based crimes. Collaborative efforts with the academe, and the business sector, and the private ICT community should be part of this national campaign. 
 Climate Change  Scientific studies show that the Philippines is highly vulnerable to the negative effects of climate change. In its most recent assessment, the Inter- Governmental Panel for Climate Change


-----

###### stressed that the rising global temperature has already impacted on the climate threshold of the earth. For the Philippines, the findings predicted that we will experience extreme maximum and minimum temperatures, more frequent intense rains, and more disastrous tropical cyclones (e.g. Typhoon Haiyan) with an average of 22 typhoons per year. The possibility of more El Niño weather episodes will also increase. According to a 2015 study funded by the US Agency for International Development, every single major city in the Philippines is expected to face some form of water shortage by 2025.  Scholars of climate change believe that change in climate variability increases the risk of armed conflict in certain circumstances, even if the strength of the effects is uncertain. Evidence suggests that climatic events over a large range of time and spatial scales contribute to the likelihood of violence through multiple pathways. The effects of climate change on conflict and insecurity have the potential to become key risks because factors such as poverty and economic shocks that are associated with higher risk of violent conflict are themselves sensitive to climate change. Given the enormous impact of climate change especially on the poor and vulnerable population, the United Nations viewed climate change as a threat multiplier or as an indirect pathway that could exacerbate existing sources of conflict and insecurity. There are five channels through which climate change could affect security: (i) threat to the well- being of the most vulnerable communities; (ii) impact to economic development --

###### halting or significantly slowing-down growth thereby worsening poverty and increasing desperation; (iii) second-order effect of unsuccessful adaptation in the form of uncoordinated coping or survival strategies of local population; (iv) threat posed by climate change to the viability and even survival of a number of sovereign states; and (v) availability or access to natural resource and the resultant competition and possible territorial disputes between countries.
 Institutional Concerns  Other urgent concerns include much-needed reforms in the core security and judicial sectors with emphasis on the f o l l o w i n g : m o d e r n i z i n g a n d professionalizing the armed services; strengthening the judicial system; strengthening legislative oversight on security agencies; and improving the national security and intelligence community. Renewed focus should be given to the following key governance issues:  stamping out corruption and professionalizing the bureaucracy; removing institutional obstacles to academic and scientific research and development; facilitating a more- responsive procurement system; providing a more-realistic and mission-supportive government auditing rules and regulations; and enhancing the Government’s ability to quickly deliver basic services.
