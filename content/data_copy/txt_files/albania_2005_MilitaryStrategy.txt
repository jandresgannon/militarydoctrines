**INTRODUCTION**

The Military Strategy (MS) specifies how the Armed Forces carries out the basic
missions defined in the Constitution and the Security Strategy of the Republic of
Albania.

**The Revised Military Strategy is a readjustment of the Military Strategy**
document approved in July 2002 by the Parliament.

It estimates the internal and external security environment, progress in
transformation and restructuring of the Armed Forces, and evolution of the Long
Term Plan of the Development of the Armed Forces, and reflects required changes
to Armed Forces missions, organizations, and Armed Forces development
concepts.

The Military Strategy defines how the Armed Forces are transformed, organized,
modernized, and trained. It seeks to increase operational capability of the AF, to
make them capable to perform their constitutional mission, interoperable and
deployable, anticipating their integration into collective Euro-Atlantic defense
structures.

The attainment of the strategic objective of Albanian membership in NATO, that is
the main goal of this Strategy, is accomplished through development of a
professionally capable force that can provide a positive contribution to internal
and regional security and stability. At the same time, this objective is also part of
a geographically vital supplement to NATO’s strategic objectives for reinforcing
stability in the South-Eastern region.

**SECURITY ENVIRONMENT**

Albania is part of a geo-strategic environment that can be considered, on one
hand, as a Balkan environment with all the inherited historical issues of this
region, and, on the other hand, as a European one, where western democratic
countries positively and strongly impact stability, democratization, and
integration.

The NATO presence in the region is a primary factor for the guarantee of stability
and encouragement of cooperation and understanding among the region’s
countries. In addition, the efforts of all regional countries to be integrated in the
EU increase the prospects for regional security, stability, economic development,
prosperity and peace.

Despite progress in recent years, the South East European region continues to
face challenges derived from historical factors and from the fragility of emerging
democracies in countries of this region.
.
**The Internal Situation and Risks**

Albania’s internal situation presents development opportunities as well as
potential risks to its security. The obvious progress in consolidating legal
democratic state institutions, the existence of a wide political consensus about
major issues of security and defense of the country, strengthening democratic


-----

civilian control over the Armed Forces, as well as improved economic indicators,
positively impact the development of a secure internal environment.

At the same time, the existence of challenges such as illegal trafficking of human
beings, weapons and drugs, organized crime, terrorism, existence of an
uncontrolled quantity of light weapons in the hands of the population,
misinforming the public, uncontrolled migration of people, and natural and
environmental disasters impact the country’s security.

Under these conditions, the Armed Forces play an important role in directly
preventing and combating these challenges, as well as in assisting government
organizations and civil society.

**The External Situation and Risks**

The current situation in the region and wider, with problems and solutions still
undecided coming mostly from its complex history, fragile government
institutions and inadequate economic development, contains the premise that a
crisis in one state may have destabilizing effects on the security of other state or
states.

In this context, revival of radical ethnic feelings as well as the tendency to use
military force for their solution, may also affect the security of the Republic of
Albania.

Asymmetric risks pose the greatest new challenges to today’s military forces,
globally and/or in our country. These threats include international and/or
regional terrorism, organized crime, illegal trafficking of all kinds, environmental
pollution, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, etc.

Under these conditions, the Armed Forces have a key role in support of the policy
of the Republic of Albania of providing contributions for building regional
confidence. They are prepared to develop the required operational capability to be
ready to resolve any situation with regard to security. Involvement of the Armed
Forces in collective defense structures, and cooperation with NATO and partner
countries further increases the common interests of the country, and regional
and global security.

This security environment, on the one hand provides good conditions for
transformation and preparation of the Armed Forces to integrate into NATO’s
military structures, whereas, on the other hand obviously increases the need for
their readiness to face situations that may place at risk Albania’s national
interests.

**THE MILITARY STRATEGY**

The Military Strategy determines how the military components act to support the
Security Strategy of the Republic of Albania, and how they accomplish their
designated missions. It provides to the Armed Forces the framework for adapting
to internal and external geo-strategic changes in the security environment. Also,
it guides Armed Force transformation and modernization, as a basis for the
primary objective of integration into NATO collective security structures.


-----

**The essential feature of the Military Strategy is its defensive character.**

The Military Strategy reviews the mission, organizations, and operational
concepts of the Armed Forces and provides direction for the short and mid term,
in support of the security of the Republic of Albania in the framework of collective
security. It guides cooperation and security contributions with regional
neighbors, realized through such activities as multinational training activities and
peace support operations.

This Strategy is itself a real contribution to building regional transparency and
confidence, by being open with regard to the AF’s mission and structure, as well
as with regard to implementation of arms control agreements.

The Military Strategy develops defense capabilities for the country to support the
objectives of the Defense Policy[1] to:

1 Ensure the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the
Republic of Albania, the protection of the population in time of peace,
crises, and war, and the protection of national interests.

2 Support Government foreign policy objectives, especially for the
integration of the country into Euro-Atlantic structures and the
promotion of peace and international security.

**A. Objectives of the Military Strategy**

− Developing the Armed Forces to guarantee the defense of the country;

− Increasing the operational capabilities of the Armed Forces.

− Transforming and Modernizing the Armed Forces.

− Increasing the capabilities for participation in humanitarian operations in
case of disasters and peace support operations.

− Integrating into Euro Atlantic and European collective security structures.

**The main aim of these objectives is the transformation and the modernization**
of the Armed Forces to establish a smaller military force, whose financial resource
requirements and infrastructure are reasonable and sustainable by the country’s
economy. This force will be motivated and operational.

**Integration in EU and the structures of NATO**

Integration in EU and NATO structures is a primary strategic objective of the
Republic of Albania.

1 The Defense Policy is the defense portion of the Security Strategy of the Republic of Albania.


-----

The Armed Forces have appropriate and dedicated personnel and logistic support
for full alliance integration. They have orienting and training plans and programs
for the development of force capabilities to accelerate the process of becoming a
NATO member.

The fulfilment of our obligations in the framework of PfP, through implentation of
MAP, IPP, participation in PARP, contribution to PSOs and humanitarian aid in
case of disasters, active participation in joint exercises, accomplishment of the
engagements in the framework of the Adriatic Charter-3, and the active role in
the South East European Brigade (SEEBRIG) are significant indicators of Armed
Forces integration.

**B.** **The Principles of the Military Strategy**

-  **Defensive character**

The Military Strategy has a defensive character dedicated to supporting
Albania’s foreign policy, and does not consider any state as an enemy.



-  **Civil democratic control** **over the Armed Forces.**

The Armed Forces are under civil democratic control, in command and
control, their transformation and development, defense planning, and
financial resources.

-  **Armed Force’s transparency and reliability.**

The Military Strategy is based on the principle of reliable defensive
capabilities, in the context of cooperating with and contributing to Euro
Atlantic collective defense structures.



-  **Conducting operations within joint doctrine**

Strategic and technological developments on the modern battlefield require
that the Armed Forces conduct operations within a Joint Doctrine,
interoperate with NATO and other allied forces in a coalition framework.

-  **Based on the traditions and the fighting values of the Albanian people**

The Military Strategy is based also on the traditions and the fighting values
of the Albanian people. They are a precious experience in the defense of
freedom.

**C. Concept of Military Strategy**

The Strategic Concept of Armed Forces employment is:

To face the challenges, risks, threats and conflicts that may be imposed on our
country through employment of Rapid Reaction Forces, the gradual increase of
reserve force mobilization, and in cooperation with Alliance forces in the
framework of European and Euro-Atlantic collective defense and security.

Cooperation and partnership with Euro Atlantic as well as with regional nations
are the best ways to prepare the Armed Forces for interoperablity and readiness
for integration in a collective security environment.


-----

The Military Strategy of the Republic of Albania is based on the strategic concept
that the Armed Forces will provide:

-  Reliable defense capabilities

-  Flexible and adaptive responses to various situations

-  Cooperation and partnership.

**Reliable Defense Capabilities.**

The Armed Forces provide a professional and integrated force in order to respond
in an effective and timely manner to the threats and challenges of the security
environment.

Basing of Armed Forces organizations near main communications roads,
seaports, and airports responds to the requirements and responsibilities for rapid
reaction in executing the missions of the Armed Forces in times of peace, crises
and war. This facilitates the deployment of rapid reaction forces for immediate
participation in regions of emergencies and natural disasters, or responding to
deal with a crisis threatening Albania’s territory.

**Flexible and Adaptive Responses to a variety of situations.**

Response to situations begins with obtaining information, through surveillance
and reconnaissance of activities in the territorial space (sea, air, and land) of the
Republic of Albania. Cooperation among Services and Supporting Commands of
the Armed Forces is a constant requirement of the Military Strategy to respond to
various situations. Timely and combined responses require an improved, well
organized and coherent modern C3 (Command, Control, and Communications)
system.

Early identification of developing threats is indispensable and required to prompt
and preventive measures. This task is accomplished by specialized forces which
in peacetime are positioned to provide monitoring and reconnaissance of
developing crisis, conflicts or threats.

The high readiness of specialized forces and rapid reaction forces increases their
participation level in regional and global peace support and other coalition
operations.

In extreme situations, when the territorial integrity of the Republic of Albania is
directly threatened, the Armed Forces are mobilized to resist aggression, in
concert with Alliance and partner countries.

**Cooperation and Partnership.**

Armed Forces cooperation and partnership with forces of NATO nations, and on a
bilateral and regional basis with partner nations, is a priority to implement the
Security Strategy goal of integration of the Republic of Albania into Euro Atlantic
collective structures.

The Armed Forces will be active in bilateral and multilateral cooperation and
regional military training activities (including peace support training), as well as
contributing through military transparency to regional trust, confidence-building,


-----

and arms control. For all of these cooperative activities, the ongoing Armed
Forces reforms and modernization, and emphasis on interoperability and NATO
standards, are essential.

**D. Characteristics of the Armed Forces.**

Based on these objectives, principles, and strategic concepts, the intent is that
the Armed Forces be:

-  **Joint**

-  **Interoperable**

-  **Ready**

-  **Flexible/Adaptable**

-  **Sustainable**

-  **Capable of Military Support to Civil Authorities**

-  **Task Organized**

-  **Capable of Special Operations**

-  **Capable of Specialized Tasks**

**Joint Force. The development of the capabilities of each kind of Services’ forces**
is oriented in a way that each Service combines its unique capabilities to an
overall joint force, capable of carrying out all assigned missions.

**Interoperable Force.  Interoperability is essential to ensure integration in joint**
and combined force operations. This is achieved through organizing and training
the Armed Forces in compliance with NATO doctrine and standards, and
participating in bilateral and multilateral exercises, always in accordance with the
operational capability development concept.

Participation in peace support operations is an especially key factor for increasing
operational capability and interoperability.

The Armed Forces plans and are trained for the development of the capability to
interoperate with other government organizations in case of crisis and disasters.

**Ready for the Mission. A high degree of readiness is essential to successful and**
rapid response in carrying out the missions of the Armed Forces. Readiness to
respond to mission requirements is achieved through organizing, planning, and
training. Peacetime engagement and training of the Armed Forces with military
forces of other states (NATO/PfP, Adriatic-3 Charter, and Bilateral) is of
importance to provide rapid and interoperable response capabilities. They also
cooperate with local and central government, and participate in peace support
operations and exercises led by NATO and EU.

**Flexible/Adaptive. Peacetime development of the Armed Forces is also designed**
to provide forces, which are flexible and adaptive in compliance with a variety of
missions. This flexibility means a capability to organize and maneuver joint force
groups or joint reinforced units, depending on the situation, and aimed at
accomplishing the mission.


-----

**Sustainable. The Armed Forces must be sustainable in executing their missions.**
Logistics, support forces and appropriate infrastructure are of decisive
importance to enable forces to be capable beginning in peacetime to execute their
tasks in response to the expected situation. They develop and maintain an
appropriate infrastructure and constant logistic support.

**Capable of Military Support to Albanian Civil Structures.  The Armed Forces**
must be capable of adapting and employing military organizations to support the
country’s civil structures to manage natural and human disaster (floods,
earthquakes, fires, etc.). Therefore, the Armed Forces are trained to develop and
adjust their capability for civil protection missions.

**Task Organized Forces.  When necessary the General Staff organizes groups of**
forces (Task Force) from units of the Armed Forces to respond to special tasks.
Their establishment is based on the principles of rationality, sufficiency,
autonomy of action, and jointness, as well as cooperation with other
organizations.

**Special Operations Forces. The Armed Force’s organizations include other**
formations especially equipped and trained for special operations. These forces
are capable not only of carrying out special military tasks, but also have an
essential role in the war against terrorism.

**Capable of Specialized Tasks. Specialized skill forces** are small but specialized
units for disposal of unexploded munitions, protection of the population from
NBC, meteorological services for the Armed Forces, military geography, weather
forecast service for air, etc. These forces can also serve to support the country’s
economy or other government organizations.

**1. MISSION OF THE ARMED FORCES**

**The mission of the Armed Forces is to guarantee the independence and**
**territorial integrity and the constitutional order of the country.**

The security dimension today has a new range of instruments of national
security. Diplomacy and the economy, as the primary elements of the government
have a role and responsibility for strengthening the county’s security, in
resolution of the Armed Forces’ constitutional mission.

The Armed Forces are the military instrument of the government for the security
of the country, and one of the three main (along elements with the diplomatic and
economic elements) of the National Security Strategy of the Republic of Albania.

Also, **the Armed Forces participate in various humanitarian aid operations in**

all requirements to enable logistics sustainment of force operations in every kind
of environment.

**Concept of Operations**

The Logistics Support Command adapts its operational capacity and capability as
required, to support the objectives of the Military Strategy, in accordance with
priorities, to assure adequate and timely support of forces.

To support the Armed Forces in times of peace, crisis, and war, the Logistics
Support Command has mobile units and the capability to support the
participation of the Armed Forces to accomplish their missions, including
bilateral and multilateral engagements as well as those with NATO forces.

The logistics system is being developed and modernized by considering the
following tasks and objectives:

-  Application of modular structures (composed of separate parts) for
concentrated and integrated logistics support of operational organizations
(deployed forces, crisis response forces, main forces, and reserve forces).

-  Establishment of supporting logistics structures, with the capacity to
interact with logistics systems of the Armed Forces of NATO countries.

-  Achievement of a high degree of effectiveness, through deployment and
capability of modular forces adaptable to the tasks of various forces.

-  Implementation of centralized planning and decentralized execution, aimed
at assuring the requested logistics support during the development of
planned operations in and outside our country’s territory in multinational
operations.

-  Development of automated logistics data processing systems.

-  Avoidance of parallel and duplicate duties between the various forces and
commands.

-  Engagement of civilian resources to support the accomplishment of tasks of
logistics organizations, including cases when engagement has economic
benefits.


**Structure.**
The Logistics Support Command is composed of: Headquarters Command and
Staff, the Supply Brigade, the Transport Brigade, the Maintenance Base, the
Military Hospital, the Depot Level (Level 4) maintenance center, and other
supporting organizations.

**Infrastructure.**
Logistics Support Command units are distributed in such a way to support the
activity of the Armed Forces. The infrastructure of the Logistics Support

Command provides support for the Armed Forces throughout all territory so they
may accomplish their mission.

**F.** **AUTONOMOUS UNITS OF THE GENERAL STAFF OF THE ARMED FORCES**

**The General Staff has under its direct control the following units: The Joint**
Operations Center, the Communications Battalion, the Support Battalion of the
General Staff, the Military Police Battalion, the Center of Signal Intelligence, the
Civil Protection Base, and other supporting units.

**The Search and Rescue Service structure is organized in a consolidated way in**
the Joint Operations Center and with other elements in Air, Navy and Land
Forces.

**5. BASIC ELEMENTS OF DEFENSE**

**A. Human Resources**

The consolidation of the general system for management of human resources and
care of personnel remains a priority duty for each organization of the Armed
Forces. This system is essential for the attraction, preparation and continuous
qualification of personnel in accordance with NATO standards.

The application of plans for the long-term education and training of officers and
NCOs provides progressive professional development for the personnel of the
Armed Forces. A primary role is the development of career NCOs and manning
the TOE-s with professional soldiers.

Recruiting of personnel for the Armed Forces and mobilization of the reserve
forces is performed throughout the Republic of Albania territory by the
organizations assigned for this task. This system will ensure partial mobilization
in case of tension or crisis and full mobilization in wartime. Establishment of that
system will be based on mid and long term plans to achieve an appropriate
readiness level.

Local Government structures are also involved in management of this system.

**B. Education and Training in the Armed Forces**

The general concept of education in the Armed Forces is directly linked with the
development of operational capabilities in the Armed Forces. The following
should be elements of this general concept:

-  Education of conscripts, professionals, NCOs and officers, career military
personnel of all levels of command, to make them capable of carrying out
assigned missions.

-  Education of all personnel of the Armed Forces to make them aware of their
role in carrying out the mission of the Armed Forces.

-  Advanced education for career personnel, leading to higher awareness and
motivation to fulfill their tasks.

-  Leadership qualification to fill all command levels in the Armed Forces.


-----

-  Training and realistic exercises as essential unifying elements in all units of
the Armed Forces, ensuring operational readiness in accordance with NATO
standards.

**The system of education and training is organized and functions in accordance**
with overall concepts of education in the Armed Forces. These concepts are
developed at the Defense Academy, the Military University “Skenderbej,” Troop
Schools, the Basic Training Center, and the NCO Academy.

The Armed Forces education system performs preparedness for a wide spectrum
of expected missions—defense readiness, military support to civil structures, and
participation in peace support operations. The main goal of education and
training in the Armed Forces is the creation of sustainable operational
capabilities, to ensure high readiness in response to situations in peacetime,
crisis, and war.

**Troop, commander and staff** **preparation**

Troop, commander and staff preparation seeks to increase the operational
capability of the Armed Force to accomplish the objectives of the Military
Strategy.

Preparation begins with qualitatively increasing the professional qualifications of
officers and NCOs, to increase their capabilities as leaders at any command level.
The preparation and qualitative increase of capabilities of staffs is indispensable
for preparation of units.

Unit preparation includes the training of subordinate units down to squad and
platoon level in order for the units to perform their tasks.

The performance of mission essential tasks in peace, crisis and wartime is
essential to determine the operational capability of units. The planning by
commands for unit preparation starts here.

Higher-level staffs assist and participate in the training process enabling each
small unit, tactical and operational staff to be fully prepared in order to
accomplish its mission.

Consolidation of combat unit organizations is a decisive process to ensure high
results in their preparation and training. The use of improved infrastructure for
training purposes, support by superior commands in the training process and the
effectiveness of command and control will enable high operational capabilities

Training will be conducted at a high quality level according to NATO practices,
standards and procedures and complying with the Operational Capability
Concept (OCC). Training should be conducted as combined with other services
where possible, as well as joint.

Computerization will be a progressive requirement for conducting command and
staff training and exercises at all levels. This enables all military units to learn to
work and operate together with supporting elements including other arms and
services. A final evaluation will be included in training plans that provides a


-----

critical report of the conduct and achievement of the training. This is an
indispensable step in ensuring the quality of training to achieve objectives.

**C. Infrastructure**

The infrastructure of the Armed Forces is being developed and modernized to
support the new organization and missions of forces and units, to increase the
level of training, to improve personnel living standards, and to develop
infrastructure in the most essential areas to accomplish tasks in bilateral or
multilateral frameworks.

Investments in infrastructure, especially in naval and air bases, in national
ranges, aims to fulfill standards required to make them ready and available to
NATO Forces.

Development of national infrastructure takes into account its use by the Armed
Forces, as well as the execution of Host Nation obligations in support of
NATO/coalition forces which may operate in, train in, or pass through the
territory of the Republic of Albania.

Infrastructure excess to the positioning plan and unnecessary for the Armed
Forces will be eliminated in accordance with a designated plan. Transformation
and improvement of the maintenance system of are being done in response to the
requirements that the Armed Forces have for products and maintenance.

**D. Financial Support of the Armed Forces**


The programs of restructuring and
modernization are improved and
revised on the basis of the actual
fiscal reality of the planned years.
The effective process of decisionmaking and contemporary methods
and systems for managing resources
helps the defense institution in
effectively managing the resources
provided to make the appropriate
decisions, in order to support the
objectives of the Military Strategy.


For continuing the defense program,
transformation and modernization of
the Armed Forces according to
objectives of this Strategy, an annual
progressive increase of the defense
budget of 0.1 per cent of GDP is
required in order that the defense
budget be 2% of GDP by 2010,
consistent with indicators of economic
development of the country. The
Armed Forces modernization fund will
be a separate item within the

government budget.


-----

**The advantages for Transformation and Modernization of the Armed Forces**
**are:**

-  Improvement of Operational Readiness for mission. The Armed Forces
will focus on training of active forces capable of performing their
missions according to NATO standards, including selected units of
rapid reaction and in forward deployed and interoperable operations
with NATO/coalition forces.

-  Equipment Modernization/Replacement as soon as possible, within
financial constraints.

-  Reorganization of Armed Forces according to standards for
accomplishment of mission and tasks determined in the Military
Strategy.


Other primary elements for transformation and modernization of the Armed
Forces are: the consolidation of the Planning, Programming, Budgeting System
(PPBS), which now is being applied in the structures and units of Armed Forces;
establishment of C4 systems, completion with helicopters and ships for Search
and Rescue; and completion with essential ground transport vehicles of priority
organizations of the Armed Forces.
