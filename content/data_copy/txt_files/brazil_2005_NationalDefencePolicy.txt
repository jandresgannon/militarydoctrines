**NATIONAL DEFENSE POLICY**

**INTRODUCTION**

The National Defense Policy, aimed, mainly, towards external threats, is the conditioning
document of the highest level of defense planning, and has as purpose the establishment of
objectives and guidelines for the preparation and employment of national training, with the
involvement of the military and civil sections, in all spheres of the National Power. The Ministry of
Defense coordinates the necessary actions for the National Defense.

This publication is composed of a political part, which contemplates the concepts, the
international and national environments and the defense goals. Another part, that of strategy,
includes the orientations and guidelines.

The National Defense Policy, theme of interest to all segments of the Brazilian society, has
as premises the foundations, objectives and arranged principles in the Federal Constitution and it is
in consonance with the country’s governmental orientations and foreign policy, which is based in
the search for peaceful solution to controversies and in the invigoration of peace and international
security.

After a long period without participating in conflicts that affect the national territory
directly, the Brazilian perception of threat has diminished considerably. Even so, it is imprudent to
imagine that a country with the potentiality of Brazil doesn't have disputes or antagonisms when
aiming to reach its legitimate interests. One of the purposes of the National Defense Policy is to
make all the segments of the Brazilian society aware that the defense of the Nation is a duty of all
Brazilians.

**1. STATE, SECURITY AND DEFENSE**

1.1 The State has as basic principles its territory, people, laws, own government and
independence in its foreign affairs. It has the legitimate monopoly of the coercion means to enforce
law and order, democratically established, providing them, also, security.

1.2 In the beginning, security was only seen by the angle of confrontation among States, i.e.,
of a basic need of external defense. As societies developed, new demands were added, besides the
threats of external attacks.

1.3 Gradually, the concept of security was enlarged, embracing the political, military,
economic, social, and environmental fields among others. However, the external defense has a
primordial role in the armed forces in the interstate sphere.

The measures that aim to security are of wide spectrum, involving, besides external defense:
civil defense; public security; economic policies, of health, educational, environmental and other
areas, many of which are not treated by means of the political-military instruments.

It is relevant to consider that security can be focused from the individual, from society and
from the State, from which result definitions with different perspectives.

Security, in general lines, is the condition in which the State, society or the individuals are
not exposed to risks or threats, while defense is an effective action to obtain or to maintain a desired
degree of security.

Specialists summoned by the Organization of the United Nations (UN) in Tashkent, in 1990,
defined security as “a condition by which the States consider whether there is danger of a military
aggression, political pressures or economic coercion, so that they can dedicate themselves to its
own development and progress freely.”

1.4 For the appreciation of the National Defense Policy, the following concepts are adopted:

I - **Security is the condition that allows the Country to preserve its sovereignty and**
territorial integrity, the accomplishment of its national interests, free from pressures and threats of
any nature, and the warranty to its citizens of the exercise of their constitutional rights and duties;
II - National Defense is the array of measures and actions of the State, with emphasis in the
military expression, for the defense of the territory, of the sovereignty and of national interests
against threats preponderantly external, potential or obvious.

**2. THE INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT**

2.1 The world is going through more complex challenges than those faced during the past
period of bipolar ideological confrontation. The end of the Cold War reduced the degree of
foreseeability of the international affairs in force since the 2nd World War.

In this environment, a widespread conflict among States is not very likely. However, they
renew in the world conflicts of ethnic and religious character, the exacerbation of nationalism and
the fragmentation of States, with a vigor that threatens the world order.

In this century, disputes can be intensified for maritime areas, aerospace domain and sources
of fresh water and energy, which are more and more scarce. Such issues can lead to interference in
domestic affairs, configuring conflict frames.

With the occupation of the last terrestrial spaces, the borders will continue to be reason of
international litigations.

2.2 The phenomenon of globalization, characterized by the growing interdependence of the
countries, by the technological revolution and by the expansion of the international trade and of the
flows of capitals, resulted in progresses for a part of humanity. Parallelly, the creation of economic
blocks has been resulting in competitive arrangements. For the developing countries, the challenge
is that of a positive insertion in the world market.

In that process, the national economies became more vulnerable to crises caused all over the
world by economic and financial instability. The growing exclusion of significant portion of the
world population from the production processes, consumption and access to information constitute
potential source of conflicts.

2.3 the configuration of the international order based on unipolar power in the military field
associated to the asymmetries of power, produces tensions and undesirable instabilities to peace.

The prevalence of multilateralism and the invigoration of the principles consecrated by
international law as sovereignty, no-intervention and equality among States, are the promoters of a
more stable world, turned to the development and well being of humanity.

2.4 The environmental issue is still one of humanity's concerns. Countries detainers of great
biodiversity, enormous reservations of natural resources and immense areas to be incorporated to

the productive system can become object of international interest.

2.5 The technology of information progress, the use of satellites, electronic sensorial devices
and countless other technological improvements brought larger efficiency to the administrative and
military systems, above all in countries that dedicate larger financial resources to Defense. In
consequence, vulnerabilities were created that can be explored, aiming of to make unfeasible the
use of our systems or to facilitate interference from afar.

2.6 Currently, non-governmental actors, new threats and the opposition between nationalism
and transnacionalism permeate international affairs and the security arrangements of States. The
transnational crimes of different nature and international terrorism are menaces to peace, to security
and democratic order, usually, faced with the States’ intelligence and security instruments.

**3. THE REGIONAL ENVIRONMENT AND STRATEGIC ARCH**

3.1 The South America subcontinent is the regional environment in which Brazil intervenes.
Seeking to deepen cooperation ties, the Country visualizes a strategic arch that extrapolates the
subcontinent mass and it has included the projection through the South Atlantic border and the
bordering countries of Africa.

3.2 South America, distant from the main world focuses of tension and free from nuclear
weapons, the area is considered relatively peaceful. Besides, processes of democratic consolidation
and of regional integration tend to increase regional reliability and the negotiated solution to
conflicts.

3.3 Among the processes that contribute to reduce the possibility of conflicts in the strategic
arch, stand out: the invigoration of the integration process, starting from Mercosur, of the Andean
Community of Nations and of the South American Community of Nations; the narrow relationship
among the amazon countries, in the ambit of the Organization of the Agreement of Amazon
Cooperation; the intensification of cooperation and of trade with African countries, facilitated by
the ethnic and cultural ties; and the consolidation of South Atlantic Peace and Co-Operation Zone.

The enlargement and the modernization of the infrastructure in South America can
accomplish the connection between its productive centers and the two oceans, facilitating
development and integration.

3.4 The security of a country is affected by the degree of instability of the area where it is
inserted. Thus, it is desirable that occur: consensus; political harmony; and convergence of actions
among neighboring countries, seeking to achieve the reduction of transnational crime rate, in search
for better conditions to economic and social development that will make the area more cohesive and
stronger.

3.5 The existence of unstable zones and of transnational crimes can provoke the overflow of
conflicts to other countries in South America. The persistence of those focuses of uncertainties
imposes that the State defense is seen as a priority, to preserve its national interests, sovereignty and
independence.

3.6 As a consequence of its geopolitical situation, it is important to Brazil that the process of
integrated and harmonic development is deepened in South America, which extends, naturally, to
the fields of defense and regional security.

**4. BRAZIL**

-----

4.1 The Brazilian profile - at the same time continental and maritime, equatorial, tropical
and subtropical, of long terrestrial border with almost all South American countries and of extensive
coast and jurisdictional waters - gives the Country geostrategic depth and it makes the task of
general planning of defense complex. This way, the diversified national physiography
accommodates differentiated landscape that, regarding defense, demand, at the same time, general
policies and specific approach for each case.

4.2 The Brazilian continental portion contemplates complex physiographic diversity, that
can be synthesized in five macro-areas.

4.3 The defense planning includes all regions and, in particular, the vital regions where there
is a larger concentration of political and economic power. Complementarily, it prioritizes the
Amazon and the South Atlantic due to their wealth of resources and access vulnerability on their
terrestrial and maritime borders.

4.4 The Brazilian Amazon, with its great mineral and biodiversity wealth potential, is focus
of international attention. The warranty of the presence of the State and the vivification of the
border strip are hindered by the low demographic density and by the long distances, associated to
the precariousness of the terrestrial system of transports, which conditions the use of waterways
and of aerial transport as main access alternatives. These characteristics facilitate the practice of
transnational and related crimes, besides facilitating the presence of groups contrary to national
interests.

The vivification, the appropriate indigenous policies, the sustainable use of natural resources
and the protection of the environment are essential aspects to the development and to the integration
of the area. The densification of the presence of the State, and in particular of the armed forces,
along our borders, is a necessary condition to conquer the objectives of stabilization and integrated
development of the Amazon.

4.5 The sea has always been related to the progress of Brazil, from the country´s discovery.
The natural Brazilian maritime vocation is backed by its extensive coast and by the strategic
importance that the South Atlantic represents.

The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea allowed Brazil to extend the limits of
its Continental Platform and to exercise the jurisdictional right on the economic resources in an area
of about 4,5 million square kilometers, area of vital importance to the Country, a real “Blue
Amazon.”

In that immense area are the largest reservations of petroleum and gas, indispensable sources
of energy for the development of the Country, besides the existence of fishing potential.

The globalization increased the economic interdependence of the countries and,
consequently, the flow of cargo. In Brazil, the maritime transport is responsible for moving almost
the totality of external trade.

4.6 To the continental and maritime portions overlaps aerospace dimension is put upon, of
the highest importance for the National Defense. The control of the aerial space and its good
articulation with neighboring countries, as well as the development of our aerospace training,
constitute important sector objectives.

4.7 Brazil defends an international order based on democracy, multilateralism, cooperation,

5

the proscription of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and on the search of peace among
nations. In that direction, it defends the reformulation and the democratization of decision making
instances of international organisms, as form of reinforcing peaceful solution to controversies and
its trust in the principles and norms of International Law. However, it is not prudent to conceive a
country without capacity of compatible defense to its stature and political aspirations.

4.8 The Federal Constitution of 1988 has as one of its principles, in international affairs, the
repudiation of terrorism.

Brazil considers that international terrorism constitutes a risk to peace and to world security.
It condemns emphatically their actions and it supports the resolutions emanated from the UN,
recognizing the need of nations working together in order to prevent and combat terrorist threats.

4.9 Brazil attributes priority to the countries of South America and Africa, especially those
from Southern Africa and Portuguese-speaking, seeking to deepen the ties with those countries.

4.10 The intensification of the cooperation with the Community of Portuguese-Speaking
Countries (CPLP), integrated by eight countries distributed through four continents and united by
common denominators as their history, culture and language, it constitutes another important factor
of our foreign affairs.

4.11 Brazil has cooperation ties with countries and blocks traditionally allied that enable
knowledge exchange in several fields. Concomitantly, it seeks new strategic partnerships with
developed or emergent nations to increase those exchanges.

4.12 Brazil acts in the international community respecting the constitutional principles of
self-determination, no-intervention and equality among States. In those conditions, under the
protection of multilateral organisms, the country participates in peace operations, seeking to
contribute to peace and international security.

4.13 The persistence of obstacles to world peace requests permanent modernization and the
progressive refit of our armed forces, with emphasis in the development of the defense industry,
seeking the reduction of technological dependence and to overcome the unilateral restrictions of
access to sensitive technologies.

4.14 In consonance with the search for peace and for international security, the Country is
signatory of the Agreement of Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and it highlights the need for
the execution of Article VI, which foresees the negotiation for the total elimination of nuclear
weapons on the part of the nuclear potencies, safeguarding the use of nuclear technology as
economic goods for peaceful purposes.

4.15 The continuous Brazilian development brings increasing implications to the energy
field with reflexes to the country’s security.
It falls to the Country to guarantee a diversified energy source that explores the potentialities
of every available natural resource.

**5. OBJECTIVES OF NATIONAL DEFENSE**

The international affairs are directed by a complex game of actors, interests and norms that
stimulate or limit the power and the prestige of the Nations. In that context of multiple influences

6


-----

and of interdependence, countries seek to accomplish their national interests, and they can generate
associations or conflicts of different intensities.

This way, it is essential to structure the National Defense in a compatible way with the
political-strategic stature to preserve the sovereignty and national interests in compatibility with the
interests of our region. Thus, from the evaluation of the described environments, the following
objectives of the National Defense emerge:

I - The warranty of sovereignty, of national patrimony and territorial integrity;

II - The defense of national interests and people, of goods and Brazilian resources in the
overseas;
III – The contribution for the preservation of the cohesion and national unit;

IV – The promotion of regional stability;

V – The contribution for the maintenance of the peace and of the international security; and

VI -The projection of Brazil in the concert of nations and its broader insertion in
international decision making processes.

**6. STRATEGIC ORIENTATIONS**

6.1 The Brazilian State performance regarding its defense has as foundation the obligation
of contributing to the elevation of the country security level, in time of peace, as well as in conflict
situation.

6.2 The preventive portion of the National Defense resides in the valorization of diplomatic
action as first instrument of solution to conflicts and in strategic attitude based on the existence of
military capacity with credibility, capable to generate deterrence effect.

It is based, thus, in the following basic presupposed propositions:

I - borders and limits perfectly defined and recognized internationally;

II - close relationship with neighboring countries and with the international community
based on trust and mutual respect;

III - rejection of war of conquest;

IV – search for the peaceful solution to controversies;

V - valorization of multilateral forums;

VI - existence of modern, balanced and prepared armed forces; and

VII - capacity of national mobilization.

6.3 The reactive defense portion, in case aggression occurs against the Country, it will use
full national power, with emphasis in the military expression, exercising the right of legitimate
defense foreseen in the Charter of the UN.

6.4 In larger conflicts, in a coherent way with its history and the conjectured scenario, Brazil
can participate in of collective defense arrangements authorized by the Security Council of the UN.

6.5 In the management of international crises with political-strategic nature, the Government
will determine the articulation of the different involved sectors. The employment of the armed
forces can take place in different ways, in agreement with national interests.

6.6 The country’s military expression is based on its armed forces capability and the
potential of mobilizable national resources.

6.7 The armed forces should be adjusted to the country’s political-strategic stature, being
considered, among other factors, the geographical dimension, the economic capacity and the
existent population.

6.8 The absence of obvious warlike litigation, the diffuse nature of current threats and high
degree of uncertainties, product of the speed with which changes take place, demand emphasis in
the intelligence activity and in the capacity of readiness of the armed forces, to which are
underlying characteristics, such as versatility, interoperability, sustainability and strategic mobility,
by means of light and flexible forces, capable to act jointly and to execute different types of
missions.

6.9 The invigoration of the Country`s capability in the defense field is essential and should
be obtained with permanent involvement from governmental, industrial and academic sectors,
aimed to scientific and technological production and to innovation. The development of the defense
industry, including the domain of technologies of dual use, is fundamental to reach a safe and
foreseeable provisioning of materials and defense services.

6.10 The regional integration of the defense industry, like Mercosur, should be object of
measures that propitiate mutual development, market enlargement and obtainment of strategic
autonomy.

6.11 Besides the traditionally allied countries and blocks, Brazil should seek other strategic
partnerships, seeking to enlarge exchange opportunities and trust development in the defense area.

6.12 In face of the strategic importance and the wealth they shelter, the Brazilian Amazon
and the South Atlantic are areas that have priority for the National Defense.

6.13 To oppose the threats to the Amazon, it is indispensable to execute a series of strategic
actions aimed to the invigoration of the military presence, effective action from the State in the
socioeconomic development and enlargement of cooperation with neighboring countries, aiming to
the defense of its natural wealth and its environment.

6.14 In South Atlantic, it is necessary that the country has means with capacity of exercising
the surveillance and the defense of the Brazilian jurisdictional waters, as well as to maintain the
security of the maritime communication lines.

6.15 Brazil needs to have means and capacity of exercising the surveillance, the control and
the defense of its aerial space, including continental and maritime areas, as well as to maintain the
security of the aerial navigation lines.

6.16 Based on the Federal Constitution and in favor of the National Defense, the armed
forces can be used against internal threats, aiming to the preservation of the exercise of the State

sovereignty and the indissolubility of the federative unit.

6.17 To enlarge the country’s projection in the world concert and to reaffirm its commitment
with the defense of peace and with the cooperation among the peoples, Brazil should intensify its
participation in humanitarian actions and in peace missions with the support of multilateral
organisms.

6.18 Based on the Federal Constitution and in ratified international treaties, that reject and
condemn terrorism, is indispensable that the Country has agile structure, capable to prevent terrorist
actions and of conducting counter terrorism operations.

6.19 To minimize the damages of possible cybernetic attack, the permanent search for
improved security devices and the adoption of procedures that reduce the vulnerability of the
systems are essential and allow its ready re-establishment.

6.20 The development of defense mentality in the midst of the Brazilian society is
fundamental to sensitize it concerning the importance of the issues that involve threats to the
country’s sovereignty, national interests and territorial integrity.

6.21 It has priority to assure the foreseeability in the allocation of resources, in sufficient
quantity, to allow the adequate preparation of the armed forces.

6.22 The employment of the armed forces in guaranteeing law and order doesn't interfere in
the context of this document and occurs in agreement with specific legislation.

**7. GUIDELINES**
