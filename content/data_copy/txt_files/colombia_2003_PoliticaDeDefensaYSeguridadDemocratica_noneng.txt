# Letter from the President, Álvaro Uribe Vélez

Restoring order and security – a basic prerequisite for the strengthening
of civil liberties and human rights – is a central concern of this Government.
Democratic Security is what is required to guarantee the protection of
the citizens. If the State protects all its citizens equally and without
discrimination, all Colombians will be able fully to enjoy their rights.

Democratic Security has a number of guiding principles and a set of
policies that we are putting into practice. This document presents the
roadmap of what we have done and what we have yet to do, so that
Government officials, members of the Armed Forces and the National
Police, as well as citizens in general understand our security policy as a
whole and contribute to its achievement.

Democratic Security differs from the notions of security expounded by
authoritarian regimes, which are based on ideological hegemony and
political exclusion. This Government rejects the idea of “National
Security” of bygone eras in Latin America, which considered certain
ideological groups or political parties as the “enemies within”. We believe
that all are welcome in a democracy. The opposition, those who disagree
with the ideas of the Government or of their own party, will receive the
same protection as those who support or agree with the Government.

Security and democracy are not mutually exclusive. On the contrary,
security guarantees the room for debate and dissent – the oxygen of all
democracies – so that differences of opinion are not also risks to one’s
personal security. However, a clear line must be drawn between the
right to disagree and criminal conduct. Only when the State rigorously
punishes crime and combats impunity will the space for opposition and
criticism be fully guaranteed.

The antithesis of democratic politics is terrorism. The terrorist uses
violence to impose his will on others, at the expense of the lives of
thousands of civilians. That is what we witnessed in the attacks on the El
Nogal Club in Bogotá and in the city of Neiva. We witnessed it, too, in
Fortul, Arauca, where terrorists tricked a child with a bicycle bomb
which they later activated, putting an end to his life. There can only be
one response to terrorism: its defeat. Those who continue to engage in
such criminal conduct will feel all the weight of the law.

We Colombians will not give in to this threat. We will defeat it with the
support of all citizens. The key concept here is solidarity. Solidarity between
citizens and solidarity with the security forces. This principle, a pillar of our
constitution, is essential for peaceful coexistence, for the successful integration
of Colombian society. The massive show of support of the population in
co-operating with the authorities has made clear the determination of
Colombians to put an end to terrorism.

We also need the support and co-operation of other countries, especially
those of the region, in order to stop terrorism and its ally, the illegal drugs
trade. We must freeze terrorist assets, pursue their men and bring them
before the law. As I have said on many occasions: those who choose to
shelter terrorists will end up being their victims. In the fight against terrorism
it is not the sovereignty of nations that counts, but the sovereignty of
democracy. It is a struggle between the sovereignty of democratic nations
against the sovereignty of terrorism. A fight of all against terrorism.

We require efficiency with transparency. Efficiency measured in results and
transparency measured in the strictest respect for human rights. In Colombia,
we are lucky to count on an Armed Forces and a National Police that have
a tradition of respect for democracy and the Constitution like no others in
the continent. Efficiency framed by transparency and the strict observance
of the law will be the basis of our actions.

We will regain the security of our citizens without limiting their freedoms.
Colombia has always been an example in Latin American of press freedom.
It has never occurred to us to restrict this right through the imposition of
exceptional or permanent regulations. We only ask that journalists, like all
citizens, act responsibly when it comes to disclosing information that may
endanger the security of all.

All our actions will be plain and for all to see. The Armed Forces and the
National Police represent the coercive element of the Constitution. They
have a mandate to protect the life, liberty and property of all citizens. They
are not “actors” in a war or conflict and should not be put implicitly on the
same level as the terrorist organisations which they confront. They will fight
these organisations with absolute determination, whether they come from
the left or the right. The legitimacy of our institutions is built on our resolve
to fight on a par all organisations, groups or persons who threaten the security
of our citizens, institutions and democracy.


Colombians to put an end to terrorism.

#### 6


-----

We are as willing to embrace those who abandon violence as we are determined
to defeat terrorism. Just as we will not give up before defeating the last of the
terrorists, we welcome into our demobilisation programme all those who wish to
make a speedy peace with the Colombian State. We call upon young people
both from the countryside and from the cities who have been tricked or forced
into joining the terrorist organisations to lay down their arms and stop the suffering
they inflict on society and their own families. We are prepared to take in all those
who abandon violence, to provide them with security and educational opportunities
so that they may re-enter society. And we ask those who still harbour political
convictions or ideals to reject violence and to demobilise or reach a peace
agreement with the Government. They will have all the guarantees so that they
may exercise their political opposition.

Security is not achieved simply through the efforts of the Armed Forces and the
National Police. This is an effort of the entire State and of all Colombians. A
strong state structure, supported by citizen solidarity, guarantees the rule of law
and the respect of rights and civil liberties.

The rule of law also guarantees development and economic prosperity. Every
time a kidnapping occurs, investors’ confidence is deeply affected, capital
dispersed and employment lost. When Democratic Security develops a policy
to eliminate kidnapping, it is defending the citizens and their basic social rights.

We have made progress, but there is a long road ahead. This is a long-term
effort, which requires political perseverance to obtain concrete results, so that
we may sustain our permanent demand for support from the citizens, so that all
Colombians pay their taxes with full conviction, so that soldiers and policemen
know they can count on their support. We will not rest until we have made
Democratic Security a reality for all Colombians.

# Introduction by the Minister of National Defence, Marta Lucia Ramírez de Rincón

Guaranteeing the security of all Colombians is the responsibility not just
of the Ministry of Defence, the Armed Forces and the National Police,
but also of the entire Colombian State and of all of society. When
President Uribe asked me to gather in one document both the conceptual
framework of Democratic Security and the security policies of the
Government, I set up a team with members from the Ministry of Defence,
the Armed Forces, the War College and the National Police to analyse
and design the most adequate solutions to the security problems of the
country, following the guidelines of the President. The result of that
exercise is presented here in this document.

Transparency and openness were our guiding principles. If the citizens’
security is the responsibility of all, it is certainly above all the responsibility
of Government. So we first had to start by opening up a discussion
about security with other Government Ministries, in order to find joint
solutions. Within the framework set by the President, we have worked
out a joint security policy that assigns a central role to the prompt
administration of justice, the better management of Government finances,
the extension of public diplomacy and a well-functioning public
administration, particularly at the local level.

We have thus drawn up a long-term state policy that involves not only
the Executive, but also the other branches of power. We have designed
special interministerial strategies to deal with kidnapping, for example,
to demobilise the illegal armed groups, to protect the nation’s
infrastructure, to eliminate the illegal drugs business and to dismantle the
finances of the terrorist organisations. We are convinced that in this way
we not only fulfil our duty to protect the population, but we also secure
the space for democratic debate. On the basis of these strategies we
brought together all Government Ministries in order to establish a plan
with clear priorities, responsibilities and programmes for each institution.

Just as important for the design of our security policy was the participation
of different sectors of civil society. Through a long consultation process,
in which we circulated the first drafts of this document and organised
various discussion fora, we received comments and opinions from
intellectuals, academics, private sector representatives and from many
others who enriched the document with their observations and criticisms.


# of National Defence,

exercise is presented here in this document.


-----

All kinds of interested citizens sent us their recommendations. At the
same time, the regional security councils that the President heads week
after week in all corners of Colombia allowed us to complement the
Government’s vision with that of those who suffer first hand the effects
of terrorism and insecurity. We have taken account of all these proposals
and concerns.

This represents a radical change. We Colombians have long thought
that citizens’ security was a problem for the National Police and the
Armed Forces. For years there was a great vacuum in the activity of
other state institutions in some critical areas of our geography and our
democracy. It is precisely that vacuum that explains the growth of the
drugs business and consequently of the terrorist organisations in large
areas of our country. That is why the achievement of complete state
territorial control, so as to guarantee the rule of law and democratic
governance, is one of the pillars of this policy.

The security forces are totally committed to fulfilling their duty. In the
last few years, their commanders have seen through a successful
professionalisation process that has increased their response capacity,
their mobility, and most of all has secured them very high levels of support
from the public. The seriousness with which the Armed Forces and the
National Police have applied themselves to the learning and spreading
of a human rights culture is unparalleled in our continent and certainly in
any other country that faces the security challenges that Colombia faces
today.

As a result of this combination of ethics, professionalism and increased
efficiency on the part of the security forces, the illegal armed groups have
recognised that they are in a military cul-de-sac. Faced with that obstacle
and lacking popular support, they have instead decided to unleash their
capacity for destruction on the civilian population through the most atrocious
acts of terrorism. Day after day they take the lives of innocent civilians or
kidnap them in numbers that far exceed the violence of other such groups
in Latin America. Their own organisations subsist thanks only to the terror
with which they discipline their men and maltreat their women – and to
the resources of the drugs trade with which they buy political support,
both in Colombia and abroad.

The professionalisation of the security forces has also gained them high
levels of recognition and trust from Colombians, who identify with their
soldiers and policemen. The security forces will continue to be
strengthened and will be a key element in guaranteeing the citizens’
security. We have created new mobile brigades, high-altitude battalions,
_campesino soldier platoons – soldiers who perform their national service_

in their places of origin – special anti-terrorist units, mobile carabinero
squads, and we are extending the coverage of the National Police to all
municipalities in the country.

Every effort will be made to complement the professionalisation process
with increased co-ordination and ‘jointness’, both within the security forces
as well as between these and other state investigative and judicial bodies.
Intelligence co-ordination is a good example. From the beginning of the
current Government, the Ministry of Defence has led joint meetings of the
intelligence services of the Armed Forces, the National Police, DAS and
CTI of the Public Prosecutor’s Office. We are already reaping the benefits
of such mechanisms.

The security forces will take the first step in the effort to articulate a
comprehensive response to Colombia’s security challenges. But the next
step must be taken by the whole of the State and then by all of society. The
civilian population cannot be a target of aggressions. But we Colombians
all have not only the right, but also the duty to participate actively in the
strengthening of our democracy, to support our institutions, to back the
efforts of our security forces and to show solidarity with the victims of
forced displacement, terrorism and violence in general. A strong democracy
and a nation built on citizen solidarity are the best guarantee of our rights.

I have no doubt that with the leadership of President Uribe and a long-term
security policy that has our citizens’ support we shall achieve our goal of
individual security, the strengthening of the rule of law, the protection of
democracy and, consequently, the well-being of all Colombians. Which is
nothing less, as the President has pointed out, than the realisation of the
principles and goals on our coat of arms: liberty and order.

Various academics and representatives of the private sector who had the
opportunity to comment on this document pointed out the necessity of
assuring the continuity of the policy over a long period in order to achieve
its goals. That is why we have proposed that it be adopted as a state policy
for the next ten years.

# I. Democratic Security and Defence Policy

1. _Democratic Security and Defence Policy is a framework_
document in which the Government has set out the basic principles
of Democratic Security, in order to protect the rights of Colombians
and to strengthen the rule of law and the authority of democratic
institutions, with the support of the citizens. The Democratic Security
and Defence Policy is a long-term state policy which will unfold in
co-ordination will all Government ministries and other branches
of power. True security hinges on the capacity not only of the
security forces to exercise the coercive power of the State, but
also of the judiciary to guarantee the efficient administration of
justice, of the Government to fulfil the constitutional responsibilities
of the State, and of Congress to legislate without losing sight of
security as the public good par excellence.

2. This document contains the general directives which will serve as
guidelines for all plans and strategies to be formulated by
Government Ministries, the Armed Forces and the National Police,
and all other state institutions, which will set benchmarks and timetables in order to fulfil the objectives of this policy.

3. This document first sets out the basic principles of the policy;
secondly, it describes the main threats to Colombian democracy
and to the security of individual citizens; thirdly, it lists the strategic
objectives which must be met in order to counter these threats;
and finally, it describes the courses of action to be taken to fulfil
these objectives.

**Democratic Security**


4. The general objective of the Democratic Security and Defence
Policy is to strengthen and guarantee the rule of law throughout
Colombia, through the reinforcement of democratic authority. That
is, through the free exercise of authority by democratic institutions,
the effective application of the law and the active participation of
the citizen in matters of common interest.

5. The strengthening of the rule of law is the essential prerequisite to
achieving the aim of Democratic Security: the protection of each


**«The general objective of the**

**Policy is to strengthen and**
**guarantee the rule of law throughout**

-----

**«The strengthening of the rule of**
**law is the essential prerequisite to**
**achieving the aim of Democratic**
**Security: the protection of each and**
**every citizen.»**

**«Security is not regarded primarily**
**as the security of the State, nor as**
**the security of the citizen without**
**the assistance of the State. Rather,**
**it is the protection of the citizen**
**and democracy by the State with**
**the solidarity and co-operation of**
**the whole of society.»**


and every citizen, as stipulated by the Constitution. If the rule of
law is firmly established throughout Colombian territory, then the
rights and freedoms of the citizen will be protected; and the more
the citizen feels protected, the more citizen participation and security
increases.

6. Security is not regarded primarily as the security of the State, nor
as the security of the citizen without the assistance of the State.
Rather, it is the protection of the citizen and democracy by the
State with the solidarity and co-operation of the whole of society.
Democratic Security is thus based on three pillars:

! _The protection of the rights of all citizens, regardless of gender,_
race, origin, language, religion or political ideology. All citizens,
both those living in the country and those living in the city, are equal
before the law and enjoy the same rights. The peasant, the
businessman, the priest, the trade unionist, the school teacher, the
human rights activist, the university professor, the journalist, the
soldier and the policeman will all receive the same protection from
the State, without discrimination.

! _The protection of democratic values, plurality and institutions._
Pluralistic political debate depends upon the existence of a safe
environment which allows the free expression of opinion and the
free exercise of democratic authority. Politicians, both in
Government and in opposition, need security to exercise their
mandate or to participate in the political process without fearing
for their personal security. Those who attack, kidnap or threaten
mayors, councillors, governors, deputies, members of Congress
and other political leaders are not only attacking an individual citizen,
but the democratic will of the people as well. The Democratic
Security and Defence Policy seeks to protect all political leaders,
while securing the democratic framework and the opportunities for
citizen participation provided by the Constitution.

! _The solidarity and co-operation of all citizens in defence of_
_democratic values. It is the role of the State to uphold the rights_
of the citizen and to provide the institutional mechanisms for the
peaceful resolution of conflicts. However, the proper functioning
of institutions also requires the active participation, solidarity and
commitment of the citizen. Democratic participation consists not
only in the use of the vote, but also in the observation and promotion
of the civic values which uphold pluralistic political debate, in playing
an active role in public affairs and in the defence of the freedom of
each individual.

```
13

```

-----

7. This is, in short, a policy for the protection of the population. It
is a mistake to think, as some do, that there are only two ways
forward in Colombia: ‘the path of peace’, which is the responsibility
of the political leadership, and ‘the path of war’, which is the
responsibility of the Armed Forces. This would free the political
leadership and society in general from their responsibility to
contribute to the security of all citizens, thus abandoning a threatened
population to its fate and assigning to the Armed Forces and the
National Police a task which they cannot accomplish on their own.
Security is not principally a matter of coercion: it is the constant
and effective presence of democratic authority, based on the
collective effort of the whole of society (18)[1] .

8. Secondly, so long as there is impunity and a lack of respect for the
law and democratically constituted authority, the population will
remain under threat, regardless of any possible negotiations with
illegal armed groups. Unless the democratic institutions are
strengthened, there will always be organisations, groups or persons
that will continue to profit – whether they adduce political motives
or not – from the absence of authority in order to wield arbitrary
power over the population, to extort in return for ‘protection’ and
to profit from the trade in illegal drugs.


7. This is, in short, a policy

collective effort of the whole of society (18)

```

**Democracy and Human Rights**


9. Unlike other regions of the hemisphere, where the rights of the
citizen were eroded by the excessive use of power on the part of
the State, the rights of Colombian citizens have been threatened
mainly by the historic inability of Colombian institutions to assert
their authority throughout the country and to provide citizens with
continuous and reliable protection against the threat and arbitrary
action of illegal armed groups. Despite the reinforcement and the
extension of the reach of democracy as a result of the 1991
Constitution, the actions of the illegal armed groups over the last
ten years have led to the rapid erosion of the authority of democratic
institutions. Together with the illegal drugs traffickers, these
organisations destroy the legal order and thereby open up areas of
impunity not only for their illegal activities, but also for many other
forms of crime. Their attempt to destroy or replace democratic
institutions where their authority is weak not only undermines
democratic governance, but also exposes the population to a reign
of intimidation, violence and terror.

10. The strengthening of democratic authority is thus an essential
prerequisite to guaranteeing a respect for human rights. It is often


«Security is not principally a matter
**of coercion: it is the constant and**
**effective presence of democratic**
**authority, based on the collective**
**effort of the whole of society.»**

**«Unless the democratic institutions**
**are strengthened, there will always**
**be organisations, groups or persons**
**that will continue to profit –**
**whether they adduce political**
**motives or not – from the absence**
**of authority in order to wield**

**«Human rights are the foundation**
**and the raison d’être of the**
**Constitution. If they are to have**
**their full force, democracy must be**
**sovereign and the State must be**
**capable of upholding the law**
**througout the territory.»**

**«The security of Colombians will be**
**re-established within the law and**
**the democratic framework, which**
**will itself become stronger as**
**security improves.»**


forgotten that human rights are more than just maxims of behaviour;
they are the foundation and the raison d’être of the Constitution.
If they are to have their full force, democracy must be sovereign
and the State must be capable of upholding the law througout the
territory .

11. A proper respect for human rights, which is both a basic condition
and an objective of democracy, can only be achieved when
democracy is strong and bridges the gap between the law and
real life: when the laws and institutions of the State are effective,
political debate is not under threat and the citizen can play an
active role, participating in community affairs, overseeing the
authorities and in general showing solidarity with others.

12. The strengthening of the rule of law requires not only effective
institutions, active citizen participation and the prevalence of judicial
norms which guarantee rights and liberties; it also requires the
Government to act in accordance with law. The security of
Colombians will be re-established within the law and the democratic
framework, which will itself become stronger as security improves.
This will guarantee that the law and the respect for human rights
prevail over the arbitrary abuses of the illegal armed groups. There
will never be reconciliation without total respect for human rights
(24).


13. The prerequisite for the strengthening of the rule of law is the gradual
consolidation of state control over the whole of Colombian territory.
Without state territorial control it is not possible to guarantee the
proper functioning of the justice system, which is hindered in many
areas of the country by the intimidation which prosecutors, judges
and local authorities suffer at the hands of illegal armed groups
and drugs traffickers. And without the full application of the law,
the population is exposed to the threats and arbitrary power
wielded by the illegal armed groups and loses its rights and
freedoms.

14. The security forces will initiate the process of consolidating State
control of the territory, establishing their permanent and definitive
presence in all municipalities with the help of mobile brigades and
other units of the Armed Forces and the National Police. Units
composed of professional soldiers, _campesino soldiers and_
National Police carabineros will guarantee that territorial control
ismaintained(89) However theresponsibilityforcitizensecurity

**Territorial Control and Co-ordinated Action of**
**the State**

cannot rest exclusively on their shoulders, for the reasons already
mentioned (7). All state entities will contribute to the consolidation
of democratic authority throughout Colombia.

15. The proper functioning of the judicial system, in particular, is the
key to security, peaceful coexistence and a strong democracy.
Just as the realisation of human rights requires the active
participation of the citizens, so does citizen participation require
the free exercise of political and civil rights, which are the basis of
human rights. In other words, they require the rule of law, which is
strengthened as confidence increases in the capacity of the judiciary
to mediate conflicts effectively and impartially throughout the entire
territory and across society. Without prompt and effective justice
uncertainty prevails, thus providing the citizen with a pretext for
taking security into his own hands. The ‘privatisation’ of security
is no less a threat than the aggression suffered by those who try to
protect themselves in this way. The protection and strengthening
of the justice system, which requires territorial control, is at the
heart of the Democratic Security and Defence Policy.

16. The effectiveness of the measures to consolidate territorial control
hangs on the degree of co-ordination achieved between different
state institutions. It will be a government priority to ensure that
state action at all levels is carried out in a co-ordinated and
integrated manner and that it has the support of the citizens.
Nationally, responsibility for policy co-ordination will lie with the
National Defence and Security Council (59), which will advise the
President of the Republic on the relevant security priorities and
responsibilities of government departments, the Armed Forces and
the National Police. Local security councils will contribute to policy
co-ordination in their areas (60), with the support and advice from
the academic and private sectors. In order to achieve the unity of
action which the circumstances demand, the Government will ensure
that this policy is developed in conjunction with other branches of
power, which share responsibility in the restoration of security.

17. At operational level, interagency support structures will ensure the
co-ordination between different state bodies, to guarantee effective
judicial action (66). They will not, however, all be of a uniform
structure; the instruments at their disposal will depend on the nature
of the threat. Where territorial control is weak, the main emphasis
will be on the Armed Forces and the National Police. However,
where territorial control is not under threat but there is, for example,
a high degree of impunity, the judicial authorities will require less
support from the Armed Forces and the National Police. The

support structures will be aimed mainly at creating the necessary
security conditions so that the judicial authorities can work in a
concentrated and effective manner. The Democratic Security and
Defence Policy is one whole and will be implemented
simultaneously across the country.


**Co-operation and Solidarity**


**«Active citizen participation, co-**
**operation in the administration of**
**justice and support for the**
**authorities all play a major part in**
**the strengthening the justice**
**system and democracy and,**
**consequently, in the strengthening**
**of the rule of law. Above all, citizen**
**co-operation is based on the**
**principle of solidarity which forms**
**the basis of a social and democratic**
**State.»**

**«The Government supports the co-**
**operation projects and the solidarity**
**promoted by the NGOs in Colombia**
**and will encourage a closer**
**relationship between these**
**organisations and the Colombian**
**State, in the understanding that**
**they operate within the democratic**
**system.»**


18. Ultimate responsibility for upholding the rights and freedoms of
the citizen lies with the State, in accordance with its constitutional
obligations. However, security is also the result of a collective effort
by the citizens: it is the responsibility of all. Active citizen
participation, co-operation in the administration of justice and
support for the authorities all play a major part in the strengthening
the justice system and democracy and, consequently, in the
strengthening of the rule of law. These are constitutional duties
which every citizen must strive to fulfil; but above all, citizen cooperation is based on the principle of solidarity which forms the
basis of a social and democratic State. If common interest takes
precedence over individual interest, if every Colombian shows as
much solidarity towards those living in remote areas as he does
towards his relatives or his neighbours, if he exercises his right and
fulfils his duty to participate in the formation, exercise and control
of political power, he will increase solidarity, strengthen the
institutions and improve security.

19. In promoting solidarity the Government will work not only with
the citizens in general but also with all sectors of civil society, such
as academia, the private sector, non-governmental organisations
dealing with development and human rights, local civic associations
and the Church. The Government supports the co-operation
projects and the solidarity promoted by the NGOs in Colombia
and will encourage a closer relationship between these organisations
and the Colombian State, in the understanding that they operate
within the democratic system. The humanitarian work of NGOs
and their promotion of a culture of human rights is a key complement
to the efforts of state institutions. It is therefore in the interest of
both the Government and NGOs that such organisations not be
abused by illegal armed groups, as has occasionally – and
fortunately exceptionally – occurred in the past.

20. Solidarity also demands a financial contribution to the security of
all citizens; it is not possible to meet the security needs of the people
unless taxes are paid. The proper payment of taxes is an integral
part of citizen solidarity.

**Efficiency and Economy**


21. State institutions must have an effective response capacity to
guarantee the security of the citizens. The Armed Forces and the
National Police in particular must retain the initiative and the capacity
to deter, prevent and respond efficiently and effectively to any
attack on the population. Where a threat exists, available resources
will be used to mount an immediate response in order to prevent
the destruction of villages, the displacement of citizens, the
kidnapping of civilians, the assassination of policemen and soldiers,
or any other act of terrorism.

22. Just as citizens are expected to contribute to the strengthening of
the security forces through the payment of taxes, so will the
Government and the security forces work within the principles of
efficiency, transparency and economy, to ensure that every peso
spent contributes to security. Savings will be made wherever
possible and used to strengthen the Armed Forces and National
Police. Administrative reforms will be introduced along with strict
budgetary controls. Cases of corruption will be severely punished.
The citizen, too, should make a contribution to the economy drive
by demanding accountability from the authorities and reporting
any waste or corruption. The Armed Forces and the National
Police will strive to achieve the right balance between operational
and support personnel, endeavouring to have more soldiers and
policemen in operational areas. At the same time, they will review
their logistical processes, with help and advice from the private
sector, so as to improve efficiency.

or any other act of terrorism.

```

**Transparency and Legality**


23. All government actions will be transparent and open to public
scrutiny. The strengthening of a culture of honesty and openness
with effective mechanisms and tools to eradicate corruption is a
matter of priority. An example will be set in the planning and
implementation of contracts, the prevention of conflicts of interest
and the rules governing ineligibility and incompatibility. Compliance
with the constitutional principles of morality, effectiveness,
economy, speed, impartiality, openness and the transparent use of
public resources will ensure the best possible results for the citizen.
Greater transparency and greater efficiency will translate into greater
credibility.

24. All government action must take place within the framework of
the law. The Government will rigorously uphold human rights and

**Government for the design and**
**implementation of action plans**
**tailored to their needs.»**


27. The use of terrorism to destabilise the State is the greatest threat to
democracy in Colombia and the world. Colombian illegal armed
groups have made civilians their prime target, in premeditated acts
using non-conventional weapons. The kidnapping and murder of
civilians, the destruction of infrastructure and the use of explosives
against the people have all been recognised by the international
community for what they are: acts of terrorism.


International Humanitarian Law, as required by the Constitution
and the Law. Any violation or abuse by a member of the Armed
Forces and the National Police or any other state body will be
punished at once. A central aim of Democratic Security is the
legitimacy of institutions in the eyes of the citizen and the community.
This legitimacy depends on the application of these principles and
the strictest respect for the law by the State.


**National Policies and Local Responses**


25. The Democratic Security and Defence Policy is an integral state
strategy with national courses of action. But the Government’s
response will be tailored to local conditions and involve local
authorities and society. The variety of factors which affect security,
the disintegration of command structures within the illegal armed
groups and their frequent merging with organised crime, as well as
the different sources which fund these organisations, mean that
different solutions must be found to suit different local conditions.
Local authorities will therefore share responsibility with the National
Government for the design and implementation of action plans
tailored to their needs.

```
19

```

**National Defence**


26. The need to focus on internal security does not imply a neglect of
external defence, which will receive the necessary attention.
Colombia will remain faithful to her tradition of peaceful relations
with her neighbours and respect for international law, but will maintain
a deterrent capability with sufficient projection to ensure respect
for her national sovereignty and territorial integrity, while keeping a
strategic defensive posture. However, the nature of the threats
which Colombia faces, particularly terrorism and the illegal drugs
trade, means that, as in the case of many other countries which
today face similar threats, the distinction between internal security
and national defence has become blurred.


**Multilateralism and Shared Responsibility**


-----

28. The strategies and actions against terrorism will be part of a state
policy that will be subject to neither partisan nor bureaucratic
interests and will comply fully with the international treaties signed
by Colombia. This will be a national effort: an effort of the entire
State and all citizens. The fight against terrorism, however, goes
beyond national boundaries and calls for a multilateral response.
Growing evidence of the involvement of international terrorist
networks with illegal armed groups in Colombia demonstrates an
urgent need for international co-operation against terrorism and
the implementation of international agreements signed since 11
September 2001, especially UN Security Council Resolution 1373
of 28 September 2001, the Inter-American Convention Against
Terrorism of 3 June 2002 and the Lima Agreement of the Andean
Community of 17 June 2002. International co-operation is needed
without delay to close the loopholes that allow terrorist groups to
obtain finance, to move around or to act, using third countries as
bases.

29. The global illegal drugs trade is equally a danger to the stability of
the State and to the citizens’ security. Its power to corrupt puts
democracy at risk; together with terrorism, it poses a threat not
only to Colombia, but also to much of the Western Hemisphere,
especially those countries in which the judiciary and state institutions
are weak. The Government will not allow Colombian territory to
go on being used by international illegal drugs trafficking
organisations and is determined to eliminate the illegal drugs trade
entirely from its territory. However, like terrorism, the illegal drugs
trade is a transnational problem; the solution does not lie in a single
country. It is also well known that illegal drugs traffickers and
terrorists use the same channels to obtain supplies and launder
money. Often a single organisation is involved in both activities
(42). The United Nations Security Council has acknowledged in
Resolution 1373 the fact that terrorism and illegal drugs trafficking
are intertwined and emphasises the need to co-ordinate an
international response to these crimes:

_“4. [The Security Council] notes with concern the close connection_
_between international terrorism and transnational organised_
_crime, illicit drugs, money-laundering, illegal arms-trafficking,_
_and illegal movement of nuclear, chemical, biological and other_
_potentially deadly materials, and in this regard emphasises_
_the need to enhance co-ordination of efforts on national,_
_subregional, regional and international levels in order to_
_strengthen a global response to this serious challenge and threat_
_to international security”_

**«There is no greater inequality in**
**Colombia than in the access to**
**security: it is the poor who are the**
**least protected, who are displaced**
**from their land and who suffer at**
**first hand the terror of the illegal**
**armed groups».**


30. Security is not the only concern of the Government, but it is the
first. There is no greater inequality in Colombia than in the access
to security: it is the poor who are the least protected, who are
displaced from their land and who suffer at first hand the terror of
the illegal armed groups. The World Bank comes to a similar
conclusion in its study Voices of the Poor (2000), based on various
testimonies from different regions of the world: “The term
_‘security’ seems to describe one of poor people’s major_
_concerns… Poor people are vulnerable in many ways: their_
_work and livelihoods are more at risk; they live in the most_
_insecure areas, their assets are the most insecure, their housing_
_is the most liable to damage, they have the least with which to_
_protect themselves…”._

31. It is not just the protection of their rights which depends upon
security. Economic development and employment opportunities
also require a climate of security that encourages investment, trade
and local authority spending for the benefit of community, all of
which have suffered constant predation by illegal armed groups.

32. Security does not just bring economic improvements, it also
strengthens society and provides more opportunities for the citizens,
especially the less well off, to take responsibility for community
affairs by becoming involved in political decisions, in their own
economic projects and in overseeing the authorities. The
Constitution and Law 134 of 1994 provide the legal bases for the
strengthening of citizen participation, but this has yet to result in a
sufficiently active participation at local level, partly because of the
risks and threats that come with exercising political leadership in
those regions where the illegal armed groups conduct their criminal
activities.


For precisely this reason, Colombia has been lodging formal
requests for more than ten years with international organisations
for a greater commitment from the international community to
resolving the global illicit drugs problem in each and every one of
its manifestations. More effective and efficient action against the
demand for illegal drugs and against money laundering, the smuggling
of chemical precursors and the trafficking of weapons is required
(41).  Different countries may and in fact do have different
conceptions of how to deal internally with the illegal drugs problem;
but these differences must not be allowed to obscure the shared
responsibility which comes from being part of this criminal business.


**Security and Development**

```
21

```

-----

33. Security contributes in this way to the empowerment of the citizen
which is nothing less than the realisation of the autonomy and
responsibility implicit in their rights and their equality before the
law. Empowerment of the citizenry in turn contributes to security,
as it encourages a sense of belonging and participation in the
development of a common project.

34. Security is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for the
empowerment of the citizen. If a citizen is to enjoy all his freedoms,
he needs an environment which helps him develop his capabilities.
Education is crucial for increasing citizen participation and achieving
equality. For that reason, the Government will revolutionise
education through the creation of more than 1,500,000 school
places. The Government’s answer to the illegal armed groups’
promotion of violence as a way of life will be to provide children
with access to a school. Education fosters a culture of non-violence
and stimulates a greater sense of belonging to our country and of
our national values. The educational revolution and other measures
to generate economic growth and development are the subject of
the National Development Plan of the Government.

development of a common project.
```
 22

```

**The Option of Negotiation**


35. The Government has left the door open to negotiations with those
who opt for democratic politics, provided they agree to a strictly
enforced cease-fire. This will reduce violence and ensure the respect
for human rights. The Government’s position is this: an urgent
cessation of hostilities, and patient negotiation and disarmament.
Those who reintegrate themselves into society and a democratic
way of life will be given the security guarantees for participating in
politics that are the right of all in a democracy.


-----

# II. Threats

36. The security of the citizens, of democracy and of the national
interest, as defined by the Constitution, is today exposed to a
number of serious interrelated threats which often transcend national
boundaries. These are not the only dangers facing Colombian
democracy. Corruption, for example, is a major threat, as is
common criminality. Both will receive the full attention of the
Government. However, the following threats are those which pose
an immediate danger to the stability of the country, its democratic
institutions, and the lives of Colombians:

! Terrorism

! The illegal drugs trade

! Illicit finance

! The traffic of arms, ammunition and explosives

! Kidnapping and extortion

! Homicide

**Terrorism**

37. Terrorism is the main method used by the illegal armed groups to
destabilise Colombian democracy. The United Nations Secretary
General has said: “The only common denominator among
_different variants of terrorism is the calculated use of deadly_
_violence against civilians for political purposes” (Security_
Council, 12 November 2001). This is precisely what is happening
in Colombia, as can be seen from the growing number of civilians
assassinated or massacred by illegal armed groups in the last five
years:

3 The murder of 4 or more civilians at one time in one place. The numbers in brackets refer to the
number of massacres.


-----

Certain groups of civilians are particularly threatened. In the first
seven months of 2002, for example, 41 indigenous people[4] and
29 teachers[5] were murdered. Other forms of terror against the
civilian population include the forced displacement of around
300,000[6] people from their land, terrorised by the threats and
assassinations carried out by the illegal armed groups. Off-duty
soldiersand policemen in civilian clothing are also constantly targeted,
especially by the FARC. In 2002, 66 police officers[7] and 27
soldiers[8] died in this way.

38. The use of violence against the representatives of democracy is
particularly serious. It is not just the integrity of the individual that is
under threat, but also the democratic will of the people. In 2002,
144 political leaders and government officials were murdered by
illegal armed groups (83 by the FARC and 23 by the AUC)
including 71 councillors, 23 regional officials, 12 mayors and a
female senator[9] . In addition, 124 government officials and political
leaders, including a female presidential candidate, were kidnapped
(53). More than 600 mayors received death threats[10] and many
have had to move their offices to the department capital, thus losing
direct contact with those who elected them.

39. The economic infrastructure has also suffered the effects of
terrorism. In 2001, a single oil pipeline was blown up 170 times
by the illegal armed groups, costing the nation US$520 million[11] .
Oil and its derivatives represent more than one third of Colombian
exports and are the main source of funding for the health and
education services. Over the last 15 years, pipelines have been
blown up more than 950 times by the ELN and the FARC. More
than 2.8 million barrels of oil have been spilled into the rivers, fields
and woods of Colombia. The energy infrastructure has suffered,
too. Since 2000, more than 1,200 electricity pylons have been
blown up[12] .

40. The illegal armed groups have established links with international
terrorist groups. Their exchange of technology and other resources
constitutes a serious problem for Colombia; but it also poses a
threat to the countries from which these other groups originate, as
they use the resources obtained from the Colombian groups to

**The Illegal Drugs Trade**


**«In 1982, some 13,000 hectares of**
**coca were grown in Colombia; the**
**FARC had around 1,800 armed**
**men. Twenty years later, in 2002,**
**the cultivation of coca accounted**
**for 102,000 hectares[14]** **; FARC**
**membership had risen to 16,900[15]** **.**
**Cultivation had multiplied by a**
**factor of 8 and FARC membership**
**by a factor of 9.»**

**«The ever increasing involvement of**
**the FARC and the AUC in the illegal**
**drugs business, which today goes**
**as far as controlling routes and**
**international commercialisation,**
**has contributed to the loss of**
**ideological discipline and**
**consequently to their downward**
**spiral into terrorism.»**


41. The illegal drugs trade at all stages of production, from cultivation
through to processing, export, distribution and the laundering of
proceeds, threatens the stability of democratic institutions and the
cohesion of society by distorting the economy and encouraging
corruption and lax standards. It has cost the lives of thousands of
judges, journalists, politicians, policemen and soldiers. It has also
become the main source of funding for the terrorist activities of the
illegal armed groups and a major threat to the biodiversity of
Colombia, one of the richest on the planet.

42. The dispute between the FARC and the illegal self-defence groups
over the coca growing areas largely determines the geography of
violence in Colombia. More than half of all FARC fronts are based
in coca production areas, which goes far to explain the
organisation’s rapid expansion. In 1982, some 13,000 hectares
of coca were grown in Colombia; the FARC had around 1,800
armed men[13] . Twenty years later, in 2002, the cultivation of coca
accounted for 102,000 hectares[14] ; FARC membership had risen
to 16,900[15] . Cultivation had multiplied by a factor of 8 and FARC
membership by a factor of 9. The AUC is also involved in the
illegal drugs trade and their expansion has been even faster: their
membership increased from 2,800 in 1995 to 12,000 in 2002[16] .
The ever increasing involvement of both organisations in the illegal
drugs business, which today goes as far as controlling routes and
international commercialisation, has contributed to the loss of
ideological discipline and consequently to their downward spiral
into terrorism. It is through the use of terror that they try to control
the local population and, in the areas of coca cultivation, they subject
it to neofeudal production conditions.

43. The traffic of chemical precursors is an integral part of the illegal
drugs trade; without them drugs could not be produced. However,
despite committing themselves to its regulation through the
ratification of the 1988 Vienna Convention, few countries exercise
any effective control over the production and trade of these
precursors. Penalties for infringement of the law tend to be light or
non-existent.

44. Consumption drives the illegal drugs business. The highest
consumers are the United States, Europe and, increasingly, South
America, all of whom suffer the social consequences of the sale
and use of illegal drugs. This is a transnational threat like no other.
It calls for a joint approach which pays the same degree of attention
to curbing demand, consumption, the traffic of chemical precursors
and money laundering as it does to the production, transport and
distribution of illegal drugs.

45. Consumers should be aware of the ecological damage and loss of
life for which they share responsibility. The Amazon Basin is under
threat from the continued cultivation of coca. The sowing of one
hectare of coca, for example, requires the felling of 3 hectares of
virgin forest[17] . In the last ten years, 1,361,475 hectares have
been deforested in this way. Tree felling also turns the Amazon
soil acid and causes erosion. This increases the sediment in the
rivers and causes floods. The felling and burning of forest in order
to cultivate coca produces around one quarter of Colombia’s total
CO[2] emissions, thus exacerbating the problem of climate change[18].
In addition, the pesticides used by the coca growers are among
the most toxic in existence. For example Paraquat, which is banned
in all industrialised countries, is often used by the coca growers;
yet it is both carcinogenic and neurotoxic and remains in the soil
for 25 years, interfering with the life cycle of the Amazon forest.
In 2000, 4,506,804 litres of such herbicides, insecticides and
fungicide were used in the cultivation of coca[19]. The processing of
the coca leaf and coca paste are no less damaging to man and his
environment. The widespread use of sulphuric acid (1,709,380
litres in 2000[20]) or potassium permanganate, for example,
endangers the lives of the coca growers and is a serious threat to
aquatic life. Vast quantities of gasoline (357,741,451 litres in 2000
– equivalent to one week’s worth of consumption throughout
Colombia[21] ) are tipped indiscriminately into the rivers and soil of
Colombia every year.

46. Poppy growing also destroys the cloud forest in the Andes. The
cloud forest absorbs large amounts of humidity in excess of rainfall
levels and so acts as a control mechanism for the flow of water to
the river basins. Its destruction causes erosion which increases
the amount of sediment in the river beds. This in turn causes major
floods which endanger the ecosystem, the local economy and the

**Illicit Finance**


**«Illicit finance is connected to a**
**whole range of criminal activities**
**which go beyond the illegal drugs**
**trade, but which also finance**
**terrorism: kidnapping, extortion, the**
**theft of hydrocarbons and**
**contraband.»**

**«Contraband in particular is**
**frequently used to launder money.**
**Not only does this deprive the**
**Government of taxes, but it also**
**undermines the Colombian**
**economy by artificially reducing**
**prices and opens up channels for**
**the trafficking of arms and drugs».**


47. Illicit finance, usually associated with the laundering of profits from
the illegal drugs trade, merits separate mention. The laundering of
revenue obtained from the commercialisation of cocaine and heroine
– most of which remain in the international banking system –
contributes directly to terrorism, while at the same time upsets
financial markets, encourages contraband and the under-invoicing
of imports, generally distorts the Colombian economy and leads
to corruption. Illicit finance is connected to a whole range of criminal
activities which go beyond the illegal drugs trade, but which also
finance terrorism: kidnapping, extortion, the theft of hydrocarbons
and contraband. Contraband in particular is frequently used to
launder money. Not only does this deprive the Government of
taxes, but it also undermines the Colombian economy by artificially
reducing prices and opens up channels for the trafficking of arms
and drugs. It also feeds the informal economy used by terrorists
and illegal drugs traffickers to cover up their activities. Contraband
is thus a transnational problem which should be tackled by the
international community and the producer companies who, either
involuntarily or in connivance with the smugglers, make the
contraband business easy and lucrative.

48. It is becoming increasingly clear that terrorists use illegal drugs
money to finance their activities and launder that money through
the same channels as the illegal drugs traffickers. A number of
international agreements and resolutions have highlighted the need
to control the sources of terrorist funding, including: the United
Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 (29); the Organisation
of American States Inter-American Convention Against Terrorism;
the Andean Community Lima Agreement; the European Union
Common Position 2001/939/PESC of 27 December 2001; the
Special Recommendations on the Financing of Terrorism issued
on 31 October 2001 by the OECD Financial Action Task Force;
and the 1999 UN International Convention on the Suppression of
the Financing of Terrorism. The Colombian Government is doing
all it can to comply with the requirements contained in these
conventions and hopes that all other States will do the same.

```
27

```

-----

**The Traffic of Arms, Ammunition and Explosives**


49. The traffic of arms, ammunition and explosives is linked both to
the illegal drugs trade and to terrorism. Both the AUC and the
FARC exchange illegal drugs for weapons on the international
market, as was evidenced by the captures of a Brazilian drugs
trafficker at a FARC camp and of AUC members in Costa Rica,
all accused of exchanging arms for illegal drugs. Vast quantities of
weapons – thousands of rifles and millions of cartridges – have
arrived in Colombia in recent years from Central America or,
through third countries, from Eastern Europe and the Middle East.
Arms trafficking networks that benefit from the tolerance and
sometimes active participation of government officials in
neighbouring countries are responsible for bringing weapons into
Colombia by air, sea or land.

50. Arms trafficking is no less a danger than illegal drugs trafficking
and should be subject to the same degree of control and the same
penalties. Since 1988, Colombia has been in the vanguard of the
drive within a number of multilateral fora to counter arms trafficking.
Colombia backs all international mechanisms which urge nations
to exercise effective control over the trafficking of arms and
explosives, such as the Inter-American Convention against the
Production and Illegal Trafficking of Firearms, Ammunition and
Explosives, the UN Action Programme for the Prevention, Control
and Eradication of the Illegal Trafficking in Small Arms and Light
Weapons or the Andean Community Lima Agreement.

51. In particular, the Colombian Government will promote any
mechanism which increases transparency in the production and
sale of weapons, in order to prevent arms from moving from the
legal to the illegal trade and the import of weapons for re-export
to third parties. It will also support the creation of an international
system of arms marking which will indicate their origin and control
their circulation.

Colombia by air, sea or land.


**Kidnapping and Extortion**


52. In Colombia, kidnapping and extortion is more than just a criminal
or police problem. Like illegal drugs trafficking, it constitutes a
fundamental means of financing the terrorist acts committed by the
illegal armed groups. Kidnapping and extortion each bring in
between US$200 and 350 million annually. In 2002, more than
2,000 Colombians from all walks of life were kidnapped by these
organisations (943 by the FARC, 777 by the ELN, 183 by the

illegal self-defence groups and 116 by dissident groups[22] ). The
ransoms paid for these individuals, especially for foreigners for
whom particularly large sums are demanded, finance terrorism
and undermine democracy.

53. Kidnapping is also used by the illegal armed groups as a method
of political blackmail. In 2002, some 124 government officials
and political leaders were kidnapped (82 by the FARC, 30 by the
ELN and 6 by the AUC), including a presidential candidate, 19
mayors, 25 councillors, one governor, 19 deputies and 3 members
of Congress[23] .

54. Kidnapping and extortion discourage investment. They also have
serious psychological impact on the individuals concerned and their
families, while society at large lives with a feeling of constant
vulnerability. The fear and experience of kidnapping fragment
society. Of the more than 3,200 kidnappings which occurred on
average each year between 1998 and 2002, around 700 are
committed by common criminals who more often than not have
been ‘subcontracted’ by the illegal armed groups[24] . Meanwhile,
as these groups and networks develop, they spread their knowhow and technology and establish structures which can easily be
expanded. Terrorists and common criminals are both involved in
an inhumane industry which, like the murder of civilians, has no
possible justification and endangers the stability of the country.


55. Over the last decade, around 25,000 Colombians have been
murdered every year in both urban and rural areas of the country[25] .
These levels of homicide are not only a threat to the security of the
citizens, but also to the proper functioning of democracy. However,
Colombia has not always suffered such levels of violence. Between
1971 and 1991, the homicide rate quadrupled from 22 to 86 per
100,000 of the population. Since then, even though rates have
fallen slightly, homicide numbers remain much the same. The
incidence of homicide is not evenly distributed throughout the
country. Some 50 municipalities containing less than a quarter of
the population account for more than half the total number of deaths.
By contrast, Bogotá has managed to reduce its homicide rate by
half in the last decade to well below the rate of many other major
cities of the continent[26] . Very often the municipalities where the
homicide rate is the highest are those over which the illegal armed

groups are fighting for control, or which have sources of finance
such as coca, oil or gold which these groups covet.

56. The homicide epidemic of the last two decades, which resulted in
some of the highest rates in the world, is not due to a natural
inclination towards violence on the part of the individual Colombian.
It is, rather, the result of institutional weakness and a climate of
impunity promoted by the illegal armed groups and illegal drugs
trafficking. It is not so much their activities but rather the indirect
impact of those activities which encourages homicide. The more
they undermine the judicial system and spread their money
laundering, weapons trafficking and murdering skills, the more they
create areas of impunity where homicide and common crime can
flourish.

# III. Strategic Objectives

57. The following five strategic objectives must be met in order to
counter the threats to Colombian security and fulfil the general
aim of the Democratic Security and Defence Policy, which is to
strengthen the rule of law throughout the country. Each objective
contains a number of specific objectives which will serve as
benchmarks for the evaluation of the strategic objectives:

**I.** **CONSOLIDATION OF STATE CONTROL**
**THROUGHOUT COLOMBIA**

! Gradual restoration of the presence of the Armed Forces and
the National Police in all municipalities.

! Increase in judicial action against crimes of high social impact.

! Strengthening and extension of the administration of justice and
state institutions in areas where state control has been
strengthened.

! Reduction of human rights violations.

**II. PROTECTION OF THE POPULATION**

! Dismantling of terrorist organisations.

! Reduction of kidnapping and extortion.

! Reduction of homicide.

! Prevention of forced displacement and facilitation of the return
of displaced populations to their place of origin.

! Reintegration into society of organisations, groups or individuals
who renounce violence.

**III. ELIMINATION OF THE ILLEGAL DRUGS**
**TRADE IN COLOMBIA**

! Interdiction at sea, on rivers and on land of the traffic of illegal
drugs and chemical precursors.

! Eradication of coca and poppy cultivation.

! Dismantling of illegal drugs trafficking networks.

! Confiscation of the property and finances of illegal drugs
traffickers.

## IV. Six Courses Of Action: Co-ordinate, Strengthen, Consolidate, Protect, Co-operate and Communicate

58. The following six courses of action are the policies which the
Government will pursue in order to achieve its strategic objectives.
They all contribute to the fulfilment of those aims:

! _Co-ordinating state action_

! _Strengthening state institutions_

! _Consolidating control of national territory_

! _Protecting the rights of all Colombians and the nation’s infrastructure_

! _Co-operating for the security of all_

! _Communicating state policy and action_

```
33

```

**A. CO-ORDINATING STATE ACTION**


**National Defence and Security Council**


**«The National Defence and**
**Security Council will be the forum**
**in which the President will liaise**
**with his ministers, the Armed**
**Forces and the National Police on**
**the implementation of the**
**Democratic Security and Defence**
**Policy.»**


59. State response to security issues affecting its citizens has perhaps
suffered most from the lack of effective co-ordination between state
institutions. Government bodies, especially the Armed Forces and
the National Police, will in future act in a co-ordinated and unified
manner in conjunction with other state bodies. The National
Defence and Security Council will be the forum in which the
President will liaise with his ministers, the Armed Forces and the
National Police on the implementation of the Democratic Security
and Defence Policy. It will issue directives setting out the roles and
responsibilities of each institution, supervise their implementation
and evaluate the results.

60. Regional authorities will set up security councils with advisory
committees that will include academics, businessmen and members
of civil society, to advise on public policy, contribute know-how
and participate in the solution of security problems. At local level,
district and municipal security councils will liaise with the regional
councils and the National Defence and Security Council to oversee
policy implementation in their areas.


-----

**Joint Intelligence Committee**


61. The Joint Intelligence Committee will be responsible for coordinating state intelligence services and will be composed of the
directors of those services. Its tasks will be to produce consolidated
strategic intelligence analysis so that the President and the Minister
of Defence may have the information necessary for decisionmaking; to translate government security policy into intelligence
requirements; and to co-ordinate an allocation of tasks which
encourages specialisation and avoids needless duplication. A
technical secretariat will provide support services and maintain
records.

62. Regional intelligence committees, similar to and with the same
objectives of the Joint Intelligence Committee, will meet
periodically. These regional committees will extend the coordination of intelligence to regional levels, encouraging horizontal
exchange of information and avoiding the time-delays that come
with excessive centralisation of the management of intelligence.

**Ministry of Defence**


63. The Ministry of Defence will be responsible for co-ordinating the
activities of the Armed Forces and the National Police with those
of other government institutions. For that purpose, it will undergo
structural reform and will issue policy guidelines for the Armed
Forces and the National Police to ensure that they meet their
Democratic Security objectives. In the first place, it will see to it
that allocated resources have a larger impact on security through
improved administration and more effective planning. The Ministry
of Defence is developing a supplies system through which the
Armed Forces and the National Police are able to obtain at the
lowest possible price high quality equipment which can be easily
deployed and kept in a state of readiness. To this end a centralised
system has been established which is open, transparent and
demands high standards and offset arrangements from the suppliers.

64. One of the priorities of the Defence Ministry will be to contribute
to the creation of jobs by ensuring that the resources allocated to
security benefit national industries whenever possible and by seeking
technology transfer.

65. The Ministry of Defence will co-ordinate the implementation of the
security policy, so that the work of the Armed Forces and the
National Police goes hand in hand with that of other state bodies

and has the support of citizens. It will also establish a series of
committees through which the private sector may contribute its
knowledge to the security effort and supervise the use of resources
assigned to the defence sector.


**Support Structures**


**«The support structures function**
**as teams in which the security**
**forces, the judicial authorities,**
**and the state investigative and**
**control bodies work together.**
**Each organisation exercises its**
**own authority but works in**

**legislation to Congress that will**
**facilitate an effective and**
**successful fight against terrorism, in**
**accordance with the obligations of**
**Resolution 1373 of the Security**
**Council of the United Nations.»**


67. Colombia needs modern legislation to counter violence and
insecurity. The Government will present legislation to Congress
that will facilitate an effective and successful fight against terrorism,
in accordance with the obligations of Resolution 1373 of the Security
Council of the United Nations. In order to deal with the terrorist
threat successfully the legal framework must be updated. If
necessary, a number of Articles in the Constitution will be amended
without affecting civil rights or liberties. Priority will be given to the
fight against crimes which most affect society. An integrated crime


66. Interagency support structures will be set up to co-ordinate the
action of regional and local state bodies and facilitate the work of
the judicial authorities. The support structures are not hierarchical
in nature; rather, they function as teams in which the security forces,
the judicial authorities, and the state investigative and control bodies
work together. Each organisation exercises its own authority but
works in close co-ordination with the others on the methodical
investigation and analysis of crime. Operational success in bringing
criminals to justice very much depends on that co-ordination:
protection from the Armed Forces and the National Police enables
the criminal investigation authorities to operate properly, whilst a
successful investigation guarantees in turn the success of the work
of the Armed Forces and the National Police, as the criminal
process becomes more effective. Specialised prosecutors with the
required knowledge to investigate each crime in detail will thus be
able to work without fear of threats and intimidation. The support
structure that investigates terrorist attacks against the oil
infrastructure in Arauca is a good example. Here prosecutors,
attorneys, the DAS, the Army and the National Police have been
working side by side with excellent results.  Such support structures
not only ensure that the justice system is protected and that state
action is effective, but also provide a control mechanism which
guarantees that they remain within the law and uphold human rights.

**B. STRENGTHENING STATE INSTITUTIONS**

**Strengthening the Judicial System**


-----

policy will enable the State to pursue individuals, such as terrorists
and illegal drugs traffickers, who represent the greatest danger to
society and democracy and to ensure that their conduct is penalised
as severely as possible in the strictest of prison regimes.

68. The Colombian Government will launch an all-out attack on
impunity in order to reduce crime levels, especially the number of
homicides and kidnappings. The whole of the state investigatory
and penal system will be strengthened and targeted particularly at
the perpetrators of murder and violence against certain members
of society, such as trade unionists, teachers, human rights activists
and journalists, who have all been the victims of intolerance and
impunity.

69. The reform of the Government’s crime policy will include the
abolition of early prison release for individuals who have committed
crimes which are deemed a threat to the stability of the country.
The principles of restorative justice will apply to crimes which are
punishable with prison. The rights of the victim will prevail. The
penalties for crimes committed by minors and for carrying illegal
weapons will be reviewed.

70. The Government will support the rationalisation of the administration
of justice and the professionalisation and specialisation of its
employees. Equally, the Government has promoted the
constitutional reform of the Public Prosecutor’s Office and the
introduction of an accusatorial system which will strengthen its
investigatory powers. It will also draft a law to speed up justice
and make it more accessible to the citizen. It will increase the
number of hearings and encourage the use of alternative procedures,
such as arbitration and conciliation, for civil, commercial,
administrative and family cases, in order to clear the backlogs in
the system. Access to “Casas de Justicia y Paz” will be improved
so that those who live in remote areas have access to the justice
system and the institutions of the State.

71. The upgrade of the countries prisons will be continued and extended
and the identification and distribution of the prison population will be
improved. Municipalities and Departments will be required to comply
with their financial obligations towards maintenance of prisons.

72. A system will be developed whereby information can be shared
by all bodies involved in the criminal justice system. It will provide
data from the time of arrest or the start of an investigation right
through to the point at which any sentence is completed.

**Strengthening the Armed Forces**


**«The authority of the Armed Forces**
**lies in the high degree of legitimacy**
**which the civil population attributes**

**reinforce that legitimacy they will**
**continue to pay particular attention**

**«Compulsory military service will be**
**reformed through a bill presented to**

**obligations. In future the service**
**will be transparent, democratic and**
**without discriminations. Everyone**
**will serve under the same**
**conditions, regardless of their level**
**of education.»**


73. The Armed Forces will concentrate their efforts on defending
Colombia’s sovereignty, the integrity of the territory and the
constitutional order. They will protect the civilian population from
any threats, dismantle the terrorist organisations, protect the
Nation’s infrastructure and defend the country’s borders, as part
of the overall aim of consolidating the rule of law in Colombia.
Their actions will always be based on the principles of efficiency,
economy, transparency and legality (21-24).

74. The authority of the Armed Forces lies in the high degree of
legitimacy which the civil population attributes to them. In order to
maintain and reinforce that legitimacy they will continue to pay
particular attention to upholding and defending human rights.

75. The process of professionalisation of the Armed Forces will
continue and they will be strengthened in five different areas:

! More resources will be allocated to increasing, reorganising and
training manpower to improve mobility.

! Funding will be spent on improving the quality of personnel and
the calibre, maintenance and state of readiness of equipment.

! Intelligence gathering, processing and analysis will be improved,
as will co-ordination so that it is available when needed and
operational capability is available when there is intelligence.

! Intensive training in human rights and international humanitarian
law for the Armed Forces and the National Police has been
successful in the past and will continue.

! Equipment and matériel will be used to the best effect in order to
ensure the availability of a deterrent capability to defend Colombian
sovereignty.

76. Compulsory military service will be reformed through a bill
presented to Congress, based on the principle of equality. Equal
citizens have equal obligations. In future the service will be
transparent, democratic and without discriminations. Everyone
will serve under the same conditions, regardless of their level of
education. At the same time, the role of the campesino soldier
will be strengthened to enable more soldiers from rural areas to
perform their military service in their own regions. This will allow

-----

them to retain their links with the community and will strengthen
the trust between the population and the security forces.

77. The Armed Forces will retain a deterrent capability by maintaining
and modernising the strategic equipment needed to guarantee the
national sovereignty and territorial integrity of Colombia, and to
defend her borders, territorial waters, continental shelf and air
space. The protection of borders will be a priority, as it is through
the borders that the illegal drugs leave and the illegal weapons
enter the country.


**Strengthening the National Police**


78. The mission of the National Police will be to protect the rights and
freedoms of the public, by fighting crime, criminality and terrorism
in accordance with the priorities established by a comprehensive
crime policy. All inhabitants will receive the same protection from
the National Police, which will return to all municipalities. Its efforts
will be centred, on the one hand, on the development of a policy
which promotes crime prevention and social harmony; and on the
other hand, on the drastic reduction of common crime and the
dismantling of terrorist and illegal drugs trafficking organisations,
through the investigation and conviction of their members.

79. The main resource of the National Police are its men and women.
The training of its members so that they may fulfil their tasks
adequately, within the framework of the principles of efficiency,
economy, transparency and legality, will be a priority. The National
Police will maintain their absolute commitment to the respect,
defence and promotion of human rights.

80. The priorities for strengthening the National Police are as follows:

! To extend the National Police coverage in a planned and organised
manner to the municipalities where there is no police presence at
the moment.

! To increase patrols in rural areas by creating 62 new Mobile
Carabinero Squadrons.

! To build fortified rural police stations.

! To strengthen the highway police.

! To boost the technical capability of the Judicial Police.

! To co-ordinate city security plans and strengthen the police force
with 10,000 new patrols and 10,000 regular auxiliaries.

! To draw up local security plans and enlarge Local Security Fronts.

! To promote the work of, and collaboration with, the Civic Police.

**«All measures that contribute to**
**the integration of intelligence will**
**be taken, such as encouraging the**

**between agencies, the**
**strengthening of trust through the**

**focus at tactical level on**
**dismantling the structures which**
**provide logistical support to the**
**illegal armed groups and organised**
**crime.»**


81. The co-ordination mechanisms between the security and intelligence
agencies will be strengthened to guarantee effective action against
criminal organisations. Operational success depends on adequate
and opportune intelligence. For this reason, all measures that
contribute to the integration of intelligence will be taken, such as
encouraging the horizontal exchange of information between
agencies, the strengthening of trust through the secure use of
information, the responsible protection of sources and the joint
announcement of operational successes. The Joint Intelligence
Committee and the regional intelligence committees (61-62) will
concentrate mainly on the production and analysis of strategic
intelligence. At tactical level, the different intelligence services will
be encouraged to co-ordinate, co-operate, specialise and
complement each other and to define clearly their functions and
responsibilities. The National Police, the Armed Forces, the DAS
and the Public Prosecutor’s Office will work together on the
collection and exchange of intelligence in order to improve their
operational effectiveness.

82. Special attention will be paid to strengthening the counterintelligence
capability of the state security services. Particularly vulnerable areas
of operational security are being reviewed, including the handling
and transmission of information and communications. Technological
improvements will be introduced, including an enhanced capability
for officers and analysts and tighter financial security, in preparation
for an aggressive campaign aimed at identifying and disrupting
sources which endanger the implementation of the Democratic
Security and Defence Policy. Corruption cases involving leaked
information will be punished severely. The counterintelligence effort
serves not only to improve operational results and to prevent the
manipulation of information: the degree of co-ordination between
the intelligence services depends also on the effectiveness of
counterintelligence. All counterintelligence work will be closely
supervised.

83. The DAS will increase its analysis and strategic intelligence
production capability in co-ordination with the other members of

```

```

-----

the Joint Intelligence Committee. It will also boost its
counterintelligence activities, which will concentrate not only on
threats to the Government, but also on anything which affects
democratic governance. At tactical level, it will focus on dismantling
the structures which provide logistical support to the illegal armed
groups and organised crime.

**Strengthening State Finances**

84. The Democratic Security and Defence Policy also aims to strengthen
the economy and generate employment by encouraging productivity
and the return of investment. Greater security will translate into
better and more efficient services in energy, transport and
communications, all of which are vital to company development
and thus to sustained economic growth. This in turn will reduce the
high levels of unemployment, which favour the activities of the
illegal armed groups.

85. The Democratic Security and Defence Policy, like social investment,
cannot be implemented without some fiscal adjustment. This is
the only way to guarantee and sustain the required level of public
funding. The Government has therefore obtained Congressional
approval for both a referendum and tax and pension reforms which
will provide resources to improve security. It is also looking at
ways of reducing the number of ministries and other government
departments in order to eliminate duplication, reduce costs and
make the state structure more effective.

86. The Government will impose severe penalties for tax evasion. A
citizen cannot expect to benefit from state services if he does not
contribute to their funding by paying taxes, even special taxes when
necessary. The use of tax revenue will be subject to strict
accountability rules (65). The National Customs and Taxation
Directorate will be strengthened to ensure effective tax collection
and data protection. A new law on the forfeit of property obtained
through illegal activities will enable the State to recover land and
other assets for the benefit of society.

**Cycle of Recovery and Consolidation**


87. Consolidating state control over the country will be a gradual but
continuous process of containing, dismantling and deterring the illegal
armed groups, protecting the population and re-establishing the
authority of democratic institutions. The idea is to create a virtuous
circle of long term recovery and consolidation which will gradually
restore an atmosphere of security throughout the country.

**Recovery of State Control over Territory**


88. The Government will gradually restore state presence and the
authority of state institutions, starting in strategically important areas.
Once the intelligence services have identified and located a threat
the Armed Forces and the National Police will begin the recovery
process with an offensive operation. Reinforcements will be
provided when necessary.


**Maintenance of State Control over Territory**


89. Once the Armed Forces and the National Police have re-established
control over an area, units comprising professional soldiers,
_campesino soldiers and National Police carabineros will maintain_
security and protect the civilian population. This will enable state
organisations and criminal investigation authorities to work in the
area. Together with representatives of the Public Prosecutor’s Office,
the Attorney General’s Office, the Judicial Police and the DAS, the
Armed Forces and the National Police will form a support structure
(66), which will be responsible for identifying and bringing to justice
members of the illegal armed groups and those who commit crimes
which have a major impact on society.

**Consolidation of State Control over Territory**


90. Once a basic level of security has been established, the State will
embark upon a policy of territorial consolidation, re-establishing
the normal operation of the justice system, strengthening local
democracy, meeting the most urgent needs of the population,
broadening state services and initiating medium to long term
projects aimed at creating sustainable development. Ministries and
other government departments involved in these projects will follow
directives from the National Defence and Security Council, so
that projects are executed once territorial control has been
consolidated and are thus not the threats and extortion of the illegal
armed groups.

**Rehabilitation and Consolidation Zones**


91. The process of territorial consolidation began with two rehabilitation
and consolidation zones in municipalities of Arauca, Bolivar and
Sucre. A sentence of the Constitutional Court determined the end
of these special measures, but the consolidation programmes will
continue to operate in these two areas. The examples of Montes
de María in Bolivar and Sucre and Arauca show the need to

**«The local authorities and the**
**National Police will draw up**
**security plans to encourage**

93. The local authorities and the National Police will draw up security
plans to encourage peaceful coexistence, reduce crime and prevent
the spread of the problems of the countryside into urban areas.
The security situation of the majority of cities calls for a response
tailored to their problems; but the principles behind the six courses
of actions of the Democratic Defence and Security Policy remain
just as relevant. In particular, it is essential that the local authorities,
together with the national authorities:

! Co-ordinate the response of the State. The mayors and local
authorities have the responsibility of formulating security policies
which integrate the efforts of the Armed Forces and the National
Police with those of other government agencies, as well as
contributing to the financing of security schemes.

! Protect and strengthen the authority of state institutions, in particular
of the justice system.


strengthen the presence of the State through a greater and more
active presence of the Armed Forces and the National Police,
which allows the Public Prosecutor’s Office and the Judiciary to
eradicate the extremely high levels of impunity and the Government
and local authorities to strengthen social investment. In the case of
Arauca, this investment depends on the correct use of local
government money, which will be protected in order to avoid their
diversion to terrorist organisations, as has occurred in the past.


**Integrated Border Security Plan**


92. An Integrated Border Security Plan will run in parallel with the
rehabilitation and consolidation zones as a means of boosting the
presence of the State in border areas.The exercise of state
sovereignty cannot be limited to the control of borders. It also
implies a more efficient exercise of the State’s functions in these
areas and the improvement of the quality of life of their populations.
The Ministries of Defence, Education, Interior, Health and Foreign
Affairs will work side by side with the Armed Forces and the
National Police, DAS and DANE on a population census, on setting
up supply programmes to meet the most urgent needs and on finding
medium to long term solutions to satisfy security, health and
education requirements of the border areas. The Government will
also seek to increase co-operation with neighbouring countries
(134), in order to prevent the abuse of the border territories by
terrorist and illegal drugs trafficking organisations.

**Urban Security**


-----

! Encourage the participation and co-operation of each and every
citizen in the achievement and maintenance of security.

! Develop reliable systems of information and statistics for an
accurate assessment of the local security needs and formulate the
appropriate responses.

! Develop mechanisms to establish targets, evaluate the performance
of the authorities responsible for citizen security, correct problems
and demand results.

94.  Without a firm commitment from the local authorities it is not
possible to guarantee citizen security. The case of Bogotá shows
that perseverance in the formulation and execution of security
policies and targets, together with active citizen participation
through mechanisms, such as the Local Security Fronts, produces
results. Similar experiences can be found in many of the major
cities of the world: alliances between the authorities and the citizenry
are the quickest and surest way of restoring security. The “Local
Security Contracts” that have successfully been put into practice
in France are an example of how government can effectively coordinate and guide citizen support to combat urban insecurity. The
co-ordination of policies to prevent and clamp down on crime,
together with active citizen participation and the support of the
private sector which creates employment opportunities and fosters
economic development is the best formula to restore security in
the cities.

**Elimination of the Illegal Drugs Trade in Colombia**


95. During the 1990s, large scale coca cultivation was displaced to
Colombia, whereupon the problem of illegal drugs trafficking,
usually associated with the power of drug traffickers to destabilise
and corrupt, became a territorial issue. The illegal armed groups
fought each other for control of the cultivation and sale of the
illegal drugs which provided their main source of income (42).
The solution lies, therefore, in consolidating state control of the
territory concerned, so that crop eradication is effective, and in
continuing to dismantle the illegal drugs trafficking groups whose
illegal activities constitute one of the greatest threats to the
consolidation of the rule of law.

96. The Colombian Government has set itself the task of eliminating
the cultivation, processing and distribution of narcotics from the
country (29). This is an ambitious goal, but the Government cannot
settle for anything less, as the struggle between the illegal armed

groups for control of the cultivation and sale of illegal drugs is one
of the greatest threats to the population. The Government will
therefore embark upon an integrated plan which will allow it to act
effectively against each link in the chain of the illegal drugs trade,
using the following strategies:

! _Interdiction. Every effort will be made to ensure that the deterrent_
effect of interdiction on illegal drugs production and sales reduces
the incentive to plant illegal crops. The Government will step up
interdiction in the air, on land, at sea and on rivers of the flow of
both illegal drugs and the chemical precursors needed for their
production.

! _Eradication. All illegal coca and poppy crops in any area will be_
eradicated by aerial fumigation with glyphosate or another product
which is equally effective and does not harm the environment, or by
manual eradication. All the technical and legal regulations will be
observed to ensure the greatest efficiency and the protection of the
environment. Farmers and indigenous people who wish to take part
in projects which encourage the production of sustainable and
profitable crops will have to break all ties with the illegal drugs trade.

! _Social programmes. Sustainable development programmes for_
growers will be one of the main tools used to put an end to the
cultivation of illegal crops and bring the growers into the legal
economy. Alternative programmes must be realistic, sustainable
and provide an income for farming and indigenous families who
currently live from the proceeds of coca and poppy cultivation.
These programmes must also have financial support from all the
countries involved in the illegal drugs trade, on the basis of the
principle of co-responsibility. Reforestation programmes, for
example, could pay farmers to plant and care for trees on land
formerly used to cultivate illegal drugs. This encourages
environmental conservation and a shift to the legal economy, which
should bring sustainable development.

! _Dismantling illegal drugs trafficking networks, focusing on their_
human resources, property, finances and trade networks.

! _Strengthening the legal framework. The law will be tightened in_
order to dismantle the illegal drugs trafficking networks and tackle
their activities more effectively. The laws governing the nullification
of property ownership and asset confiscation have been reviewed
and updated for that purpose.

! _Reduction of consumption. The Rumbos programme will continue_
its work of raising awareness and trying to reduce drug consumption
within Colombia.

**Dismantling of the financial structures of**
**terrorists and illegal drugs traffickers**


97. The Government will place particular emphasis on dismantling
the financial structures of terrorist and illegal drugs trafficking
organisations, in line with international agreements. The Joint
Intelligence Committee is to join forces with other specialist
agencies to form a committee to counter money laundering. This
will improve the exchange of information and make it easier to
co-ordinate financial intelligence gathering with the ability of the
appropriate agencies to act on such intelligence. The Government
will also establish mechanisms for co-operation with the financial
entities of the private sector and society in general so that money
laundering can be reported quickly. It will also establish control
mechanisms over the use of government funds, in particular of
oil royalties (91, 126), which have frequently been captured
through extortion and corruption by terrorist organisations to
finance their activities in various regions of the country. It will
urge other States to meet their commitments by freezing terrorist
bank accounts and denying them access to their financial systems
(48).

98. The Financial Analysis and Information Unit (UIAF) will play a
leading role in the collection of money laundering information. Its
objectives are the following.

! _Data centralisation: to develop of policies, procedures and tools_
to strengthen the fight against money laundering.

! _Data systemisation: to improve the quality of information received_
from national and international sources.

! _Information analysis: to detect potential money laundering cases_
and report them to the authorities.

In this way the mistakes of the past will be avoided. These included
the weak implementation of regulations, the poor handling of vast
amounts of information and a lack of co-ordination both between
the different agencies responsible for identifying money laundering
operations and between these and the law enforcement agencies.
The objective is fully to co-ordinate financial intelligence with
operations against the terrorist and illegal drugs trafficking
organisations.

**D. PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF COLOMBIANS**
**AND THE NATION’S INFRASTRUCTURE**

99. The basic mechanism for protecting the lives and rights of Colombian
citizens is the strengthening of the rule of law over Colombian
territory. However, many Colombians require special attention as
they have suffered and continue to suffer directly at the hands of
the illegal armed groups.


100.The Interior Ministry Programme for the Protection of Persons at
Risk has received a significant increase in funds so that individuals
whose lives, integrity, security or liberty are under threat, such as
political activists, trade unionists, community leaders, journalists
and human rights activists, are properly protected. The Programme
will also provide protection and security measures for the hundreds
of mayors, councillors and other democratic representatives who
currently find themselves under threat. The Protection Group of
the Human Rights Department of the Interior Ministry will carry
out the Protection of Persons at Risk Policy, on the basis of the
following principles:

! Recognition of the legitimacy of the activities of each of the protected
groups.

! Strengthening of the protection measures directed at assuring the
rights of the target population.

! Interagency co-ordination with the Armed Forces and the National
Police, with the aim of extending the links of trust between these
entities and the representatives of those groups under protection.

101. A Risk-Evaluation and Regulation Committee will advise and
supervise each one of the protection programmes. The committee,
made up representatives of Government Ministries and officers of
the National Police and the DAS will discuss the most adequate
protection measures for those citizens at risk and oversee their
adoption. Central, departmental and regional meetings on
interagency co-ordination will contribute to a better understanding
of the risk-situations and formulations of adequate responses to
these threats.


**Protection of Persons at Risk**

```

```

**Protection of Victims of Forced Displacement**


102. Year after year hundreds of thousands of Colombians are displaced
from their land and made destitute by the illegal armed groups.


-----

This requires urgent action on the part of the State and solidarity
on the part of society. The Social Solidarity Network will work
with regional authorities and other organisations to formulate plans
which will enable displaced families, with their agreement, to return
to their homes. The Government, in co-ordination with the Armed
Forces and the National Police, will first restore security to the
area and then provide the community with resources in the form of
small loans, food and community-escort programmes.

103. In accordance with Decree 2007 of 2001 on the recognition and
protection of the property rights of displaced communities, the
Government, with support from the World Bank Post Conflict Fund,
will assist displaced Colombians in the recovery of property and,
particularly, land lost through forced displacement. The Social
Solidarity Network will develop programmes to help those who
cannot or do not want to return to their homes to settle in other
areas. The Government will seek the support of the private sector
and society in general to find long term solutions to the problem of
displaced Colombians.

```

```

**Protection against Terrorism**


104. To protect the lives and dignity of Colombians, the Government
will take a firm stand against the increasing use of terrorism,
particularly in the major cities. The objective is to create a simple
and effective system, backed by the necessary legislation to assure
the protection of citizens. This system comprises the following
elements:

! Interagency co-ordination mechanisms that facilitate the fulfilment
of tasks, assign clear responsibilities, centralise information and
keep an institutional memory.

! Intelligence-gathering capacity not only for the prevention of
terrorist acts but also to dismantle terrorist networks; and short
intelligence cycles to move rapidly from information to action.

! Rapid reaction forces which act in an efficient and effective manner
upon receiving information.

! A technical capacity for the extraction of forensic evidence from
the sites of terrorist attacks and its adequate processing, with the
aim of bringing the terrorists to justice as quickly as possible and
thus preventing future attacks.


**«The Government, in co-ordination**
**with the Armed Forces and the**
**National Police, will first restore**
**security to the area and then**
**provide the community with**
**resources in the form of small loans,**
**food and community-escort**
**programmes.»**

**«To protect the lives and dignity of**
**Colombians, the Government will**
**take a firm stand against the**
**increasing use of terrorism,**
**particularly in the major cities.»**


-----

**«The solidarity of the citizens and**
**their co-operation with the**
**authorities is a key factor, without**
**which it will be impossible to**
**defeat the terrorists.»**

**«The core of the fight against**
**kidnapping is the dismantling of**
**the criminal organisations that**
**systematically commit these**
**offences. Interagency support**
**structures for the centralisation of**
**investigations and of strategic and**
**operational intelligence, will**
**conduct the dismantling of specific**
**groups and organisations.»**


! Active citizen co-operation, based on the common values of respect
for the dignity of the people and the rejection of violence.

These elements must be part of the policies and strategies to achieve
security and peaceful coexistence which all the mayors’ offices
will develop with the National Police (93). In the case of Bogotá,
a support structure (66) will co-ordinate the response of the
different regional and national entities against terrorism. The
Government will support this effort through the creation of special
military urban antiterrorism forces in the main cities and by seeking
international co-operation to prevent and counteract the technology
and knowledge transfer which has enabled the illegal armed groups
to plan particularly brutal terrorist attacks. Equally, the efforts to
improve co-ordination between the intelligence services (81) will
have the fight against terrorism as one of its main objectives.

105.Success, however, does not depend on international co-operation
and co-ordination alone: the solidarity of the citizens and their cooperation with the authorities is a key factor, without which it will be
impossible to defeat the terrorists. The authorities will develop
prevention programmes, extending the links between the Armed
Forces and the National Police and the private sector, the private
security companies, public businesses, and society in general, in order
to establish a warning network which will assure the protection of
the population and the country’s infrastructure (131).


106.The Government has outlined a long-term state policy to combat
kidnapping and extortion (52-54). This policy has the following
objectives:

! _General Objective: To reduce the number of cases of extortion_
and kidnapping.

! _Specific Objectives: The general objective will be achieved through_
a series of strategic courses of action directed at (i) increasing the
punishments for committing these crimes and (ii) consolidating the
citizens’ level of trust in and the international community’s belief in
the capacity of the Colombian State to confront extortion and
kidnapping.

All the programmes and actions of the various government entities
to combat extortion and kidnapping will be explicitly directed at

achieving these objectives. These activities are encompassed within
the following strategic courses of action.

107. The dismantling of kidnapping organisations:

! The core of the fight against kidnapping is the dismantling of the
criminal organisations that systematically commit these offences.
Interagency work groups, acting as support structures (66) for the
centralisation of investigations and of strategic and operational
intelligence, will conduct the dismantling of specific groups and
organisations. These support structures will be associated with a
team of specialised public prosecutors.

! These teams will work with the Financial Analysis and Information
Unit (98), in order to obtain detailed knowledge of the way in
which money flows through the criminal organisations and their
structures, and to apply the law of termination of ownership of
funds used or received from kidnapping and extortion.

! In order to support the achievement of these objectives, resources
will be allocated for: (i) the purchase of electronic intelligence and
investigation equipment according to technological advances; (ii)
the training of joint teams from the Armed Forces, the National
Police, the DAS, the CTI and the Public Prosecutor’s Office in
investigation, the collection of evidence and the management of
crime scenes; and (iii) the reward payment programmes for
information leading to results.

108. An increase in the number of rescues of kidnapped people:

! The structure, location and jurisdiction of the specialised antikidnapping GAULA groups will be evaluated and redefined. Their
procedures will be brought into line with the National Police, the
Armed Forces, the DAS and the Public Prosecutor’s Office. The
levels of operative training will be improved and the capacity of
reaction will be maintained through continuous assessment.

Counter-corruption and counter-intelligence schemes, and
scheduled and random exercises will be conducted in the GAULA
groups and in each organism involved in the fight against these
crimes, as well as in those in which the criminal organisations can
infiltrate and interfere with the work of the authorities or facilitate
their criminal activities.

109.The optimisation of information and the knowledge of the
kidnapping organisations in order to facilitate decision-making and
the dismantling of these organisations and their finances:

! The criteria for the classification and management of statistics will
be standardised and detailed information on every case will be
maintained. A decentralised information system will be put into
place which can be accessed by all the organisations involved in
the fight against extortion and kidnapping. This system will collect
all the relevant information and data on these crimes, which will
support decision-making. The priority is to construct a database
which will permit the review of each individual case of kidnapping.

! A systematic analysis of the evolution, characteristics, features,
regional patterns and modus operandi of extortion and kidnapping
will be conducted, with the aim of anticipating new trends, of
supporting decision-making and of determining more precisely the
cost structure of kidapping.

110. The implementation of a system of reception and follow-up of cases:

! A system of collection and follow-up of cases will be established
in order to: (i) ensure a direct, stable and friendly relationship with
the victims and their relatives; (ii) produce better judicial, tactical
and strategic information; (iii) deal adequately with and respond to
the information on cases filed; and (iv) ensure that the GAULA
concentrate on cases of extortion and kidnapping.

111. The consolidation of an international agenda against extortion and
kidnapping:

! The Colombian Government will request effective co-operation
and initiatives from international governments against the practices
that facilitate or favour these crimes. International co-operation
networks for intelligence, training and information technology will
be established.

112. The strengthening of the preventive capacity of the State and the
citizenry:

! Widespread information and awareness campaigns will be carried
out to encourage individuals to: (i) denounce cases of extortion
and kidnapping; (ii) report suspicious activities to the authorities;
(iii) rely on the support of the State and resist the payment of
ransoms.

```

-----

! The Government will establish simple and effective communication
channels to facilitate the reporting of these crimes. Prevention
campaigns directed at high-risk groups will be conducted.

! The voluntary adoption of a code of conduct will be encouraged
in unions, businesses, schools, universities, families, among others,
to facilitate the rapid detection of suspicious actions or situations,
which may lead to extortion or kidnapping.

! The Government will update its warning and communication
technologies and will support its use through the continuous
improvement of reaction times of the security and investigative
organisms of the State.

! The alliances made by criminal organisations in order to obtain
information on potential victims and make it easier to carry out the
crime will be identified, as will their sources of information.

! A prison security and intelligence programme will be launched to
eliminate kidnapping and extortion networks organised from within
prisons, to minimise the acquirement of criminal skills by serving
prisoners and to obtain valuable information for the dismantling of
these criminal organisations.

113. The establishment of adequate legislation:

! The judicial elements necessary for improvement in the fight against
extortion and kidnapping will be identified and presented for
consideration in Congress, within a new counter-kidnapping and
counter-extortion judicial initiative.

114. The establishment of benchmarks:

! From the start, the development of this policy will be directed at
the establishment of a review and evaluation system, based on
management and impact indicators, which will allow: (i) the
understanding of the effects of the policies and their implementation
and (ii) the redirection of the strategy or policy, if necessary.

115. The development of a work-scheme:

The President will review all policy decisions in the fight against
kidnapping and extortion. These decisions will be presented for
approval by the National Defence and Security Council (59). In
order to ensure proper communication, co-ordination and action
by all the organisms involved, the National Council for the Fight
Against Kidnapping (CONASE), headed by the Ministry of
Defence, will assign resources and tasks and will constantly monitor

**Protection of the Demobilised and Child**
**Combatants**


**«The Government has invited all**
**Colombians who belong to illegal**
**armed groups, both adults and**
**children, to lay down their arms.**
**The demobilisation programme,**
**established by Decree 128 of 2003,**
**offers a viable, flexible and rapid**
**way of starting a new life,**
**returning to the nuclear family and**
**abandoning a clandestine life.»**

**«The aim of this policy is to**
**rehabilitate and dignify the**
**demobilised, especially the young,**
**thus facilitating their reintegration**
**into society and saving lives.**


116. The Government has invited all Colombians who belong to illegal
armed groups, both adults and children, to lay down their arms.
The demobilisation programme, established by Decree 128 of 2003,
offers a viable, flexible and rapid way of starting a new life, returning
to the nuclear family and abandoning a clandestine life. This
commitment should come not only from the State and its institutions,
but also from society in general including the private sector, the
Church and civil organisations.

117. The aim of this policy is to rehabilitate and dignify the demobilised,
especially the young, thus facilitating their reintegration into society
and saving lives.Those who have demobilised will receive
psychological advice and will be offered education and technical
training for 18 months, enabling them to live a dignified life and to
help their families and society in general.

118. A person wishing to cut his ties with the illegal armed groups should
go to a military or police commander, a public prosecutor, a
representative of the ombudsman or any other civilian or judicial
authority and declare his personal and voluntary intention to lay
down his arms. That authority will then hand him over to the
competent authorities, which in the case of an adult is the Ministry
of Defence and for a minor is the Colombian Family Welfare Institute
(ICBF). They will meet the initial humanitarian needs of the individual.
Those who demobilise will be certified within a short period of time
by the Operational Committee for the Laying Down of Arms, which
will become a permanent decision making body. In order to speed
up the demobilisation process, the Public Prosecutor’s Office will
form a unit of prosecutors entirely dedicated to establishing the legal
position of those individuals who abandon their weapons, having
analysed their judicial past and the seriousness of the crimes
committed.

119. The authorities will provide the necessary documents, such as civil
register papers, identity card, military and police record, so that the
demobilised can reconstruct their identity. All state institutions will
then work together to reintegrate the individual into the social and
economic life of the country.

```
53

```

-----

120. The Demobilisation and Reintegration Programme will be a special
priority section of the Government’s general education, health and
employment policies. The Government will also set up a series of
strategic alliances with the private sector, NGOs, religious
communities – nationally and internationally – and friendly countries
with a view to establishing programmes and projects and obtaining
further funding.

121.The Government will ensure the individual’s access to all state
resources. Access to health services will be provided through the
Social Security System and to education and training though
agreements with local governments, the National Apprenticeship
Service (SENA), the Colombian Institute for Overseas Educational
Credit and Technical Studies (ICETEX), the Public Administration
School (ESAP) and other educational establishments. The individual
will also benefit from job creation programmes supported by the
Colombian Fund for the Modernisation and Technological
Development of micro, small and medium sized business
(FOMIPYME). Alternative employment opportunities will be
explored with both the private and the public sectors.

122. Just as the State and society are committed to granting certain rights
and benefits, the demobilised adult or minor has a duty to his country
and the society which receives him. He must not be involved in
criminal activities, obey the law, complete his reintegration
programme and any training courses and undertake an activity which
is both useful and productive. Any relapse will result in the immediate
loss of all state benefits.

**Protection against Recruitment of Children and**
**Adolescents**


123. The programme to demobilise the six or seven thousand children
and adolescents estimated by UNICEF and ICBF to be in the ranks
of the illegal armed groups will be complemented with policies to
prevent their recruitment in the first place. The focus of such policies
will be on the high-risk populations groups. Preventive programmes
will be launched, to: (i) prevent the illegal armed groups from tricking
individuals into membership; (ii) reinforce the attention paid to family
violence and the mistreatment of children; (iii) ensure children remain
in school; and (iv) generally promote a culture of peaceful
coexistence and resolution of conflicts.

124. Special attention will be paid to the problem of unemployment in
rural areas, especially among the young, in order to prevent hundreds

of adolescents from falling prey to the promises of a salary and
other ruses used by the illegal armed groups to recruit adolescents
– when they do not force them to join their ranks. Unemployment
in these areas is also a result of the activities of these groups, which
threaten those who generate employment in agriculture, commerce,
service and construction.

125.The Government has presented its various employment generation
policies in its National Development Plan. The social projects
encouraging the replacement of the cultivation of illicit crops with
the cultivation of corn, cotton, sugarcane, coffee and reforestation,
aim to diminish rural unemployment, to protect the environment
and to prevent the recruitment of adolescents by the illegal armed
groups. Increased access to credit for small producers, tax
incentives and agriculture machinery will foster production, while
specialised training programmes will assist the rural worker.


126.The Government is developing special programmes to prevent and
eliminate terrorist attacks on the coal, electricity, oil and
telecommunications infrastructure, ports and airports, as well as to
prevent the theft of fuel. A support structure will co-ordinate the
work of the Army, the Public Prosecutor’s Office, the DAS, DIJIN
and the Attorney General’s Office (66). The basis of these
programmes will be as follows:

! A reliable system for the collection of information and intelligence
based on citizen co-operation.

! A proper understanding of the threat and the motivation of the
terrorist.

! Armed Forces and National Police patrols in critical areas; and
the creation of rapid reaction units capable of neutralising terrorist
acts.

! The creation of inter-agency support structures which can investigate
and analyse crime.

! The securing of the correct use of the royalties generated by the
mining and petroleum industries; and the encouragement of
company investment in the local community to improve the quality
of life.

**Protection of the Roads**


127.The Government Road Security Programme is aimed at
guaranteeing safe passage for all passenger and goods traffic on
Colombia’s highways. The strategy is based on the co-ordinated
action of the relevant state institutions, particularly the Ministries
of Defence and Transport and the Public Prosecutor’s Office, with
active citizen co-operation. The Programme comprises four main
elements:

! The monitoring of traffic on the national road system.

! Prevention and rapid reaction by the Armed Forces and the
National Police.

! The presence of the mobile units of Public Prosecutor’s Office
which will speed up the prosecution of those who attack the security
and freedom of our citizens on our roads.

! Co-operation between the citizen and the authorities in the
protection of the highways.

128. In order to do this, the following programmes will be implemented:

! _A Highway Strategic Information Centre, which will collect_
information nationally and respond quickly and effectively to
security incidents on the roads and co-ordinate the role of the
various state institutions involved in the road security strategy.

! _A Road Monitoring System, which will support the efforts of the_
intelligence services to prevent crime on the roads. All information
collected will be sent to the Highway Strategic Information Centre.

! _Plan Meteor, which will co-ordinate the motorised Army_
companies and support the monitor and control of the roads.

! _Mobile Judiciary Units, which will help the Armed Forces and_
the National Police to man road blocks, make arrests, immobilise
vehicles and impound illegal goods by immediately processing the
crimes as they occur.

! _Control Systems at Toll Booths, to monitor all individuals and_
vehicles as they leave the city.

! _Air Monitoring, which will support ground units, watching and_
monitoring the roads by supplying information quickly on any
irregularities which ocurr on the roads.

! _Road Security Centres, which will help in the prosecution of_
individuals, the monitoring of vehicles and cargoes in areas where
there is a particularly high incidence of smuggling and security
problems.

! _Road Guards, to extend the capabilities of the Armed Forces and_
the National Police with motorised squadrons who will patrol the
roads.

! _Citizen Co-operation Networks which, with the appropriate_
communications equipment, will exercise their civic duties and
express their solidarity by assisting the authorities in the provision
of information on any irregularities which occur on the roads.

129.On bank-holidays, convoys (“Vive Colombia, viaja por ella”)
will continue to be organised on the main highways to enable our
citizens to travel in peace, with the special protection of the National
Police and the Armed Forces.

**E. CO-OPERATING IN THE SECURITY OF ALL**


130.The Government will encourage the voluntary and patriotic cooperation of Colombian citizens in performing their constitutional
duties and, in particular, in demonstrating the solidarity demanded
by the modern social democratic State (18), to help prevent crime
and terrorism, by providing information relating to the illegal armed
groups.The Government will also establish regional security
committees, (65) which will enlist the support of civil society.
Research on the prevention of crime and the experience of many
other countries suggests that prevention based on citizen
participation is more effective than coercive measures to contain
crime. If 44 million Colombians support and feel support by the
State, terrorism can be defeated.

```

**The Security of Solidarity**


**Co-operation Networks**


131.A network of citizens in both urban and rural areas, in accordance
with the principle of solidarity and the duty to contribute to common
security, will provide the authorities with information which will help


-----

in the prevention of crime and the pursuit of criminals. They will
also participate in programmes aimed at promoting a culture of
security. Just like the “Neighbourhood Watch” schemes that were
quickly a success in Australia and United Kingdom, these volunteers
will act as an extra sets of eyes for the authorities with whom they
will be in constant contact. Unlike that of the informants, this cooperation will receive no reward.


**Reward Programme**


132.In addition, a Programme has been set up to reward those who
provide information which leads to the prevention of a terrorist
attack or the arrest of members of any of the illegal armed groups.
The Government will also establish a system of incentives and
rewards for information about property belonging to organisations
or persons with links to terrorism or illegal drugs trafficking.


**International Co-operation**


operation will receive no reward.

```
**International Co-operation**


133.Security does not just depend on the efforts of all Colombians.
The transnational nature of the main security threats means that
co-operation between States is a necessary condition for the
security of all. It calls for simultaneous action on all sides against
every link in chain of the illegal drugs business. The Government
will initially look for increased regional co-operation with a view to
achieving the following:

! The creation of a united front by establishing co-operation
mechanisms which facilitate the undertaking of joint security force
operations with other countries and exercise strict control over the
traffic of arms, explosives, narcotics, chemical precursors and
persons.

! An increase in the exchange of financial information and intelligence
in order to monitor, identify and neutralise the activities of illegal
armed groups.

! The strengthening of the bilateral border commissions and the
promotion of agreements which will allow the security forces to
exercise more effective control along the border, especially on rivers,
in our national waters and air space, and provide for the exchange
of intelligence and co-ordinated patrols, checks, searches and
interdiction operations.

! The fulfilment of commitments under the Andean Community Lima
Agreement.

**co-operation between States,**
**particularly regional co-operation,**
**is a necessary condition for the**
**security of all. It calls for**
**simultaneous action on all sides**
**against every link in chain of the**
**illegal drugs business.»**


-----

**«The Government will support the**
**modernisation of mechanisms**
**such as the Inter-American**
**Reciprocal Assistance Treaty or**
**institutions such as the Inter-**
**American Defence Board so that**
**they are effective against the**
**major threats of today, such as the**
**illegal drugs trade and terrorism.»**

**«The exchange of technology and**
**resources between the different**
**Colombian illegal armed groups**
**and international terrorist**
**networks is a particular cause for**
**concern in Colombia. If there is**
**agreement on the symbiotic**
**relationship between illegal drugs**
**and terrorism, it is clear that real**
**international co-operation is**
**required against both activities.»**


! The reform of the existing Inter-American Security System in line
with current security threats. The Government will support the
modernisation of mechanisms such as the Inter-American Reciprocal
Assistance Treaty or institutions such as the Inter-American Defence
Board so that they are effective against the major threats of today,
such as the illegal drugs trade and terrorism. The Government will
also promote the ratification of the Inter-American Convention
against Terrorism.

134.The only possible response to a transnational threat such as the
illegal drugs trade is close international co-operation. The concept
of shared responsibility should be applied to every link in the illegal
drugs chain. Every country which shares responsibility for the illegal
drugs problem should make a joint effort to:

! Offer alternative employment opportunities and financial support to
small-scale coca and poppy farmers who voluntarily eradicate their
crops.

! Eradicate coca and poppy cultivation.

! Exchange intelligence and boost technical capabilities to tackle illegal
drugs trafficking networks.

! Co-ordinate the interdiction effort, especially in the air over the
Caribbean and the Pacific.

! Harmonise legislation on the trafficking of illegal drugs and chemical
precursors so that the penalties reflect the damage caused.

! Exchange financial information which will help identify and punish
money launderers more effectively.

! Control and reduce the consumption of illegal drugs by offering
treatment, rehabilitation and education.

135.The fight against terrorism and its financing requires the same degree
of international co-operation. The exchange of technology and
resources between the different Colombian illegal armed groups
and international terrorist networks is a particular cause for concern
in Colombia. If there is agreement on the symbiotic relationship
between illegal drugs and terrorism (29), it is clear that similar
measures should be taken against both activities. Real international
co-operation against terrorism requires all States to take the following
actions:

```
59

```

-----

! Implement the UN Security Council Resolution 1373 and comply
with the recommendations of the Council’s Counter Terrorism
Committee, which monitors their implementation, by introducing
antiterrorist legislation, not harbouring terrorist groups and not
allowing them to use their territory to carry out their activities and
administer their finances. The fulfilment of these obligations should
be automatic and should not depend upon a request from the
country where the groups originate.

! Join together to achieve greater transparency in the international
financial system, so that the efforts of some are not rendered useless
by the reluctance of others to establish the necessary controls.

! Permanently exchange information on terrorist activity.

! Act promptly to implement Interpol arrest warrants.

**F. COMMUNICATING STATE POLICY AND ACTION**


!

country where the groups originate.

!

```

!


**Terrorism and Communication**


136. Terrorism is a form of political violence which uses communication
to spread fear and terror in both urban and rural areas. Terrorist
action reflects neither military nor political strength, but rather the
weakness of those who do not have the support of the people and
try to impose their will through terror. It is an empty strength. The
Government will keep the public fully informed of developments
in all areas relating to the Defence and Democratic Security policy
in order to boost confidence and encourage citizen co-operation
and solidarity.

137. The responsible handling of information is not just a task of the
Government. The media, too, should fulfil their constitutional duty
by being both responsible and prudent when releasing information
which endangers lives or jeopardises operations. Fulfilling these
constitutional duties is an especially difficult task in a democratic
country that faces a terrorist threat, as is the case in Colombia.
Such organisations not only attack the freedom of the press through
intimidation and violence, but also spread confusion through false
information and manipulate opinion. The Government will
encourage debate and reflection around such issues as the support
of democratic values, the use of the media by those who attack
the civilian population as a sounding board to justify their actions,
and the impact of the language that is used when reporting
information.


**«The Government will keep the**
**public fully informed of**
**developments in all areas relating to**
**the Defence and Democratic**
**Security policy in order to boost**
**confidence and encourage citizen**
**co-operation and solidarity.»**

**«The Government will encourage**

**those who attack the civilian**
**population as a sounding board to**
**justify their actions, and the impact**
**of the language that is used when**
**reporting information.»**


-----

**Public Diplomacy**


138. The support of the international community is essential to the
achievement of the security of our citizens. The transnational nature
of the threats to Colombian democracy makes it impossible to
bring long term security to the people without the assistance of
other countries. In recent years Colombia has been fortunate in
receiving a good deal of international support. The country’s
situation has been discussed in international fora, as never before.
However, the nature of the problem is still misunderstood by the
general public abroad. The Government, through its foreign service
and military and police attachés, will undertake an exercise in public
diplomacy to explain the nature of the Colombian problem in its
Latin American, hemispheric and international context. Above all,
Colombia requires strong institutions which fill the vacuum of
authority, protect the population, guarantee their rights, reduce
poverty and allow the economy to prosper. More security will
mean greater incorporation into the international community, which
in turn will produce a greater diversification in production, attract
foreign investment and tourism, guarantee the transfer of technology
and open new markets. Employment sources will thus be secured
and Colombia will regain its place as an engine of growth and
development in Latin America. The strengthening of institutions will
guarantee the rule of law and the right of all Colombians to enjoy
their freedom.

# V. Financing and assessment

139.The implementation of the Defence and Democratic Security Policy
requires significant resources at a time when the country is
undergoing a period of financial difficulty. The main sources of
funding are, on the one hand, the proper and efficient collection of
taxes, such as the property tax earmarked specifically for security
matters; and, on the other hand, the Government’s commitment to
fiscal adjustments such as pension and tax reform and the
restructuring of state institutions which will free the resources needed
for security and social spending (85). From 2005 onwards,
expected additional taxation should ensure the sustainability of the
democratic security policy.

140. Periodic monitoring and assessment of all programmes will ensure
that the strategic objectives of the Democratic Security Policy are
met. Two types of indicators, based on the aforementioned specific
objectives (57), will be used:

! Management and financial indicators which measure the efficiency
of resource management.

! Impact indicators which measure the effect of a policy on the
security situation, using performance criteria linked to the strategic
objectives.

The information gained from these assessments will make it possible
to: (i) make the necessary adjustments when programmes do not
yield the expected results; (ii) give transparency to the process;
and (iii) create accountability mechanisms and define responsibilities.
